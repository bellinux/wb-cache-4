Grapes has to be harvested by hand with a maximum yield of 60hl/ha.

25|$|Soils {{with low}} {{fertility}} are ideal and help control {{some of the}} vigor of the vine. Planting vines in high densities in order to curb vigor may have the adverse effect of increasing foliage and limiting the amount of direct sunlight that can reach the ripening grapes. Advances in understanding the quality and characteristics of the different clones of Sangiovese {{has led to the}} identification and propagation of superior clones. While high-yielding clones have been favored in the past, more attention is being paid to matching the clone to the <b>vineyard</b> <b>site</b> and controlling the vine's vigor.|$|E
25|$|The Riesling grape, {{grown on}} 59.7% of the region's {{cultivated}} vineyard surface in 2008, {{is widely considered}} the most prestigious and highest quality wine grape of the Mosel but it cannot be planted on every <b>vineyard</b> <b>site</b> due to difficulties the grape has in ripening in particularly cool climates. Factors such as altitude, aspect and sunlight exposure can have a pronounced effect not only one the resulting quality of the wine but also whether the Riesling grape will even ripen at all. A positive characteristic of the Riesling grape is that despite less than perfect ripeness it can still create a wine of finesse and elegance that would escape most other grape varieties.|$|E

25|$|Early {{results in}} the late 20th century, were not very {{promising}} for California winemakers. Poor site and clonal selection had the grape planted in vineyards that gave it too much exposure to the sun, producing wines that had {{little in common with}} the wines of Tuscany. The Antinori family, which once owned Atlas Peak Vineyards located in the Atlas Peak AVA in the foothills of Napa Valley found that the greater intensity of sunlight in California may have been one possible factor for the poorer quality. Today the style of these Californian Sangiovese tend to be more fruit-driven than their Tuscan counterparts with some floral notes. Recent years have focused on improving <b>vineyard</b> <b>site</b> and clonal selection as well as giving the vines time to age and develop in quality.|$|E

50|$|The Hessische Bergstraße ("Hessian Mountain Road") is {{a defined}} region (Anbaugebiet) for wine in Germany {{located in the}} state of Hesse among the {{northern}} and western slopes of the Odenwald mountain chain.
