50|$|Leibowitz’s {{research}} investigated basic {{issues of}} visual psychophysics, perception of size, distance & motion, peripheral vision and oculomotor functioning. He also studied problems of aviation, traffic safety, motion sickness, postural instability (especially during stair descent), {{and the effects}} of stress on perception. Indeed, one of the striking characteristics of Leibowitz’s research was his symbiotic view of “basic” and “applied” science. In the early 1970s, for example, Leibowitz’s lab developed the laser optometer and used it to advance our basic understanding of the eyes’ focusing behavior (visual accommodation); these “basic” experiments simultaneously addressed real-world difficulties such as night myopia (Leibowitz & Owens, 1978) and <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> (Tyrrell & Leibowitz, 1990).|$|E

40|$|The last {{fifty years}} of {{research}} on <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> are surveyed, with special emphasis on results that may be important {{in the context of}} driving. Over that time, ideas about <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> have varied, ranging from a broad application of the label eyestrain, to virtually any visual complaint (including poor acuity), to more specific applications of the term to mean visual discomfort associated with lengthy near-vision tasks. Much of the research reviewed concerns <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> in the workplace, and places particular emphasis on extended use of video displays. One consequence of this emphasis on specific workplace circumstances is that substantial portions of the work on <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> may not be fully applicable to driving. The mechanisms developed to explain workplace <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> may not be strongly engaged in driving. This is especially likely for research that links <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> to oculomotor changes in vergence and accommodation after near work. <b>Visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> in driving is likely to be more strongly related to mechanisms such as ocular surface irritation that may occur as a consequence of eyeblink suppression, or to declines in arousal level that may occur {{over the course of a}} lengthy drive.

This study aimed to find out a relationship between <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> symptoms (VFS) of Flicker value variations in video display terminal (VDT) operators. This cross-sectional study, conducted in 2011, aimed to examine <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> and determine the relationship between its symptoms and visual flicker value changes in 248 operators of VDTs in several occupations. The materials used in this study were a <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> questionnaire of VDTs and a VFM- 90. 1 device. <b>Visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> was measured in two stages (prior to beginning to work and 60 min later). The data were analyzed by SPSS 11. 5, using descriptive statistics, paired t-test, simple and multiple linear regressions, correlation and recognition coefficients. Then regression equations of changes in flicker value depending on the changes in the main domains and the changes in final score before the questionnaire were obtained. Paired t-test indicated significant differences in the mean score of <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> symptoms and the mean score of flicker value between the two stages, respectively (P ≤ 0. 001).

40|$|Department of Human and Systems EngineeringWith the {{advancement}} of display technologies, more diverse display products are available around us. VDT (Visual Display Terminal) tasks are, however, associated with various <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> symptoms that can reduce work efficiency and task performance. Such results can be more severe for older individuals with diminished visual abilities, which typically start around the age of 40. However, studies on <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> of older individuals are relatively fewer than those for younger individuals. Though, proper work-rest schedules are deemed to reduce <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue,</b> workers have difficulty in taking rest breaks due to many reasons. It is expected that a real-time rest reminder will be effective because the time to onset of <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> can vary as <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> is affected by many factors including individual and task characteristics. Curved displays provide relatively even viewing distances across their display surface for the center viewer than flat displays, which could benefit viewing experience while reducing <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Indeed, some studies on display curvature demonstrated that curved displays are more effective than flat displays in terms of task performance, <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue,</b> and preference. Previously, various physiological measures (e. g. accommodation amplitude and near point accommodation) were considered as indices of <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Using these measures to predict <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> in daily life are, however, not practical because of difficulties in measuring and/or needs for high-cost equipment. The aims {{of the current study}} were 1) {{to examine the effects of}} task duration, display curvature, and presbyopia on physiological and perceived <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> and display satisfaction associated with performing proofreading tasks on 27 ” displays, and 2) to develop a prediction model for <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> using pupil- and bulbar conjunctiva-related measurements which can be easily obtained in daily life. A total of 64 participants (32 for each age group) performed a 1 -hr proofreading task. The current study considered task duration (within-subjects 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min), display curvature (between-subjects 600 mm, 1140 mm, 4000 mm, and flat) and age group [between-subjectsyounger (20 - 35 yrs) and older (45 - 60 yrs) ] as independent variables. Pupil diameter, bulbar conjunctival redness, perceived <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> [measured in ECQ (Eye Complaint Questionnaire) scores], and display satisfaction were obtained every 15 minutes, while CFF (Critical Fusion Frequency) was obtained pre and post the 1 -hr proofreading task. The rear-projection environment was comprised of 27 ” curved rear screens, a beam projector, and the Warpalizer software. Environmental factors that can affect <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> were controlled. An eye tracking system, a digital camera, and a flicker fusion system were used to measure physiological measures of <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue,</b> and a series of questionnaires were used to measure perceived <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> and satisfaction of display. 3 -way ANOVA was used to examine how 3 independent variables and their interactions affected each of 5 dependent variables.

40|$|Background and aims: In the {{majority}} of sensitive occupations, such as nuclear, military, chemical, etc, closed circuit systems and visual display terminals (VDTs) are used to control and monitor sensitive processes. <b>Visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> {{is one of the}} factors that decreases operators’ precision and awareness and makes the reception of visual data from VDT erroneous. This study was aimed to exanimate the association of <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> symptoms with flicker value changes in video display terminal operators. Methods: This cross-sectional study aimed to examine <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> and to determine the association between its symptoms and visual flicker value changes in 248 operators of VDTs in several occupations was conducted in 2011. The instruments that have been used in this study were a <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> questionnaire of VDTs and a VFM- 90. 1 device. <b>Visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> was measured in two stages (prior to beginning to work and 60 min later). The data were analyzed using SPSS, descriptive statistics, paired t-test, simple and multivariate linear regression, Pearson correlation, recognition coefficient (R 2) and regression equations of changes in flicker value depending on changes in the main domains and changes in final score for the questionnaire were obtained. Results: Paired t-test indicated significant differences in the mean score of <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> symptoms and the mean score of flicker value between two stages respectively (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract—To {{evaluate}} <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> when viewing stereoscopic TV, {{a technology}} {{expected to become}} the broadcasting display system of the future. Wide public acceptance of stereoscopic TV awaits resolution of many issues, including <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> on viewing TV images. <b>Visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> was induced using a visual function simulator, consisting of prism and lens optical systems, while viewing stereoscopic TV. We assessed subject <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> through subjective reports of symptoms and by the changes in visual functions. These functions included: viewer [Js fusional break point, recovery point, accommodation step response, and visual evoked cortical potentials (VECP) ]. Significant changes of some visual functions were found after watching simulated stereo-scopic TV when the vergence load was heavy or when it changed over time; relative vergence limits decreased and the latency of VECP increased after watching, reflecting <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue.</b> After subjects rested, relative vergence limits recovered to pre-viewing levels. Our findings lead us to conclude that, aside from excessive horizontal binocular parallax, discontinuous changes in parallax is also a major factor that contributes to <b>visual</b> <b>fatigue</b> in the viewing of stereoscopic images. It also causes a decreased range of relative vergence, accommodation response, and a delay in the P 100 latency of VECP.

Functional capacity was assessed with a 6 -Minute Walk Test (6 -MWT). Muscle strength and VA were determined using twitch interpolation applied to the right dorsiflexor muscles during maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC). Muscle fatigue was assessed during a sustained submaximal contraction. Distance during the 6 -MWT, muscle strength and VA were significantly lower in the MS group.
