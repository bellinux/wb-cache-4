50|$|Covert cloth, {{from which}} the coat is made, is a heavy tweed named after a covered area rich in game {{wildlife}} that {{would serve as a}} starting point on a hunt. A covert coat is always single-breasted with notch lapels, a centre <b>vent,</b> <b>flap</b> pockets, and a signature four (sometimes five) lines of stitching at the cuffs and hem; a ticket pocket is optional. The collar may be constructed of covert cloth or velvet. The traditional colour varies from a light greenish-tan brown to a fawnish mix to a rather deep tannish-green, but variants in grey and navy are also common.|$|E
50|$|After Flight 96, McDonnell-Douglas added a small {{peephole}} {{that allows}} baggage handlers to visually inspect the pins to confirm {{they are in}} the correct position, and information placards to show the correct and incorrect positions of the pins. This modification had been applied to Flight 981's plane, however, Mahmoudi had not been instructed about the purpose of the indicator window; he had been told {{that as long as the}} door latch handle stowed correctly and the <b>vent</b> <b>flap</b> closed at the same time, the door was safely latched. Furthermore, the instructions on the plane regarding the indicator window were printed in English and Turkish, but Algerian-born Mahmoudi could read neither.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} a set of operating points of a fan built in ventilation system of our test car. These operating points are given by the fan pressure characteristics and are defined by a pressure drop of the HVAC system (air ducts and vents) and volumetric flow rate of ventilation air. To cover a wide range of pressure drops situations, four cases of <b>vent</b> <b>flaps</b> setup were examined: (1) all vents opened, (2) only central vents closed (3) only central vents opened and (4) all vents closed. To cover a different volumetric flows, the each case was measured at least for four different speeds of fan defined by the fan voltage. It was observed that the pressure difference of the fan is proportional to the fan voltage and strongly depends on the throttling of the air distribution system by the settings of the <b>vents</b> <b>flaps.</b> In case of our test car we identified correlations between volumetric flow rate of ventilation air, fan pressure difference and fan voltage. These correlations will facilitate and reduce time costs of the following experiments with this test car...|$|R
50|$|The only {{external}} {{changes were}} detail changes. The bonnet was reshaped with a bulge {{to allow the}} new engine to fit in the engine bay whilst meeting pedestrian safety rules. The new dashboard and ventilation system necessitated {{the removal of the}} distinctive air <b>vent</b> <b>flaps</b> underneath the windscreen which had been a feature of previous Land Rover utility models since the 1950s. While the flaps were deleted, the bulkhead pressing remained the same, so the outlines of where the flaps would be are still present.|$|R

50|$|Bousyo-i/Tropical - The {{tropical}} cotton uniform, designed {{similar to}} the M98, were initially available in tan or light khaki, but were superseded later in the war by versions in medium to dark green. They had open collars, buttoned side <b>vent</b> <b>flaps</b> below the armpits, pleated patch or internal pockets with flaps. Trousers could be full-length, 3/4 length, or a loose fitting breeches style pantaloon. The usual uniform worn in the Pacific islands was knee length shorts worn with a lightweight cotton shirt, which had three front buttons, 3/4 length sleeves and patch breast pockets with flaps. Officers wore a short or long sleeved lightweight white (or off-white) tropical shirt with the green trousers. When they wore the green tropical tunic they usually wore the shirt collar outside and over the tunic collar.|$|R
5000|$|The initial [...] "TG&#8239;5" [...] {{version of}} the Nervasport {{appeared}} in March 1932. It was powered by the same 4241 cc inline-eight with [...] Weighing in at 160 kg less, it was appreciably faster than the Nervastella. It has a 3130 mm wheelbase and was classified as a 24CV in the French taxation system. This first model can be recognized by having a straight one-piece front bumper, five equally sized <b>vent</b> <b>flaps</b> on the bonnet sides, and a fairly upright grille. The car was considered solid, fast, and safe, albeit lacking in brakes in spite of them being of a servoed (mechanical) design. The TG&#8239;5 model code showed its close relation to the TG/1/2/3/4 models of the Nervastella. Unlike the Nervastella, the first Nervasport received a three- rather than a four-speed gearbox. As for the Nervastella, only the top two gears had synchro.|$|R
5000|$|First {{shown at}} the 27th Paris Motor Show in October 1933 (although {{recognized}} by the French authorities as a distinct model one month earlier), the ZC&#8239;2 version received streamlined bodywork reminiscent of a period Chrysler product. The related Nervastella was called the [...] "ZD&#8239;2". The body now featured a reclining grille and windshield, more rounded bodies with deeply skirted fenders and an integrated boot. The <b>vent</b> <b>flaps</b> are now larger towards {{the rear of the}} car and the front bumper now has a pronounced curving dip in the centre, all of which adds to the streamlined motif. The side-valve engine, while still retaining the 105 mm stroke and basic structure used for Renault engines since 1905, received an increased bore (now 80 mm) for a displacement of [...] The tax horsepower increased to 28CV. Power remained as before, with this becoming somewhat of a handicap in a market where outputs per litre had begun to climb. Low-end torque increased, however. The wheelbase increased to 3184 mm. Eight naked chassis were delivered to various coachbuilders.|$|R
50|$|Smoke <b>flap</b> <b>vents</b> are {{designed}} to allow for adequate indoor heating especially where indoor fireplaces are present, {{as well as to}} regulate steam, smoke and heat pressure output in devices such as chimneys, stoves, or boilers.|$|R
50|$|In Native American plains style tipi, {{the smoke}} hole {{consisted}} of one easily accessible smoke <b>flap</b> <b>vent</b> which was positioned around {{the apex of}} the interior beams and the flaps were extended outward on poles to open the vent.

In the summer months the vent may remain open to a view of the night sky and to harmonize with the warm temperatures.|$|R
40|$|The wing {{was tested}} without {{fuselage}} or empennage and was fitted with approximately three-quarter span Fowler flaps and half span spoilers. The spoilers were hinged at the 70 percent chord point and <b>vented</b> when the <b>flaps</b> were deflected. Static longitudinal and lateral aerodynamic {{data were obtained}} over an angle of attack range of - 8 deg to 22 deg for various flap deflections and positions, spoiler geometries, and vent lip geometries. Lateral characteristics indicate that the spoilers are generally adequate for lateral control. In general, the spoiler effectiveness increases with increasing angle of attack, increases with increasing flap deflections, and is influenced by vent lip geometry. In addition, {{the data show that}} some two-dimensional effects on spoiler effectiveness are reduced in the three-dimensional case. Results also indicate significant increase in lift coefficient as the Fowler flaps are deflected; when the flap was fully deflected, the maximum wing lift coefficient was increased about 96 percent...|$|R
40|$|March 5 - 6, 2009, Bangkok, ThailandTo reduce {{incidental}} {{mortality of}} sea turtles in a pound net, a new releasing system {{was developed to}} allow turtles {{to escape from the}} bag net. The turtle releasing device with <b>flapped</b> <b>vent</b> has already been developed for small-scaled pound nets, but seems ineffective for large-scaled pound nets because the turtles rarely encounter the device in a large bag net. This study examined the validity of the sloping upper panel for guiding sea turtle to the releasing device in the bag net. Tank experiments were performed with three types of experimental bag nets: a box-shaped net with horizontal upper panel, one with square-pyramid shaped upper panels of 10 degrees (10 degrees slope net), and square-pyramid shaped bag net with upper panel of 20 degrees (20 degrees slope net). Five loggerheads in captivity (SCL: 42. 8 cm- 50. 0 cm) were prepared. The turtle swam around after entering the bag net, and about five minutes later it started to push its head up against the upper panel. In the 20 degrees slope net, the turtle moved to the shallowest space of the net. This suggested that the sloping upper panel guided the loggerhead turtle to the releasing device in the bag net of a largescaled pound net...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimentally investigate the influence of vent type (side, roof or both) and of an anti-aphid insect screen on airflow and temperature distribution of a mono span greenhouse round arch roof with vertical side walls. The greenhouse was equipped with two side roll-up <b>vents</b> and a <b>flap</b> roof <b>vent.</b> A tomato crop planted in double rows was cultivated inside the greenhouse. The three components of air velocity were measured by a 3 -D sonic anemometer and simultaneously air temperature and relative humidity were recorded in several positions inside the greenhouse. Concerning the effect of insect screens, {{it was found that}} the mean value of the normalised air velocity was 65 % lower in the greenhouse with insect screens in the side vent openings than without the screens. Furthermore, with the screen in the openings, the spatial heterogeneity of microclimate variables was reduced. As far as the vent opening is concerned, it was found that in the case of side openings only, the air velocity inside the greenhouse was characterized by a strong air current near the greenhouse ground and low air velocity near the roof while the combination of roof and side openings increased air velocity and decreased air temperature inside the greenhouse but increased also the spatial heterogeneity of the greenhouse microclimate. The most homogeneous climate conditions were achieved by roof only openings...|$|R

The present study evaluated and compared four sampling techniques: carcass rinse, <b>vent</b> skin <b>flap</b> sampling, thoracic skin flap sampling, and the FSIS approved sponge method in a turkey processing plant. Carcass rinse was consistently and significantly superior to tested alternatives for the detection of Salmonella in this plant. Salmonella recovery using the carcass rinse technique on split flocks at the re-hang area from 2 different scald systems suggested that countercurrent water flow improved the microbiological quality when temperatures were similar. However, elevations of the concurrent scald tank temperature eliminated the apparent benefit of directional flow. In contrast to most previously-reported observations in broiler processing plants, overall Salmonella recovery did not increase during processing and a significantly (P < 0. 05) lower overall recovery incidence from 4 flocks was observed immediately pre-chill as compared to post-feather removal. Also in contrast to previously-reported data from broiler processing plants, overall Salmonella recovery incidence in the turkey ceca was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than in the crop in 9 flocks evaluated. These data suggest that microbiological investigations to determine plant-specific critical control points in turkey plants are warranted prior to implementation of intervention strategies. After evaluation of turkey processing, we evaluated broiler carcasses in a commercial broiler processing plant for Salmonella incidence on carcasses that had been passed or retained by the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) with regard to visible fecal or ingesta contamination. Contaminated and non-contaminated carcasses were removed from the processing line at the site of FSIS inspection (pre-immersion chilling) and subjected to the carcass rinse sampling procedure for Salmonella incidence recovery. Broiler flocks were evaluated over a 2 day period. Although a numerical association of increasing Salmonella recovery with visible contamination was observed, no significant (P < 0. 05) differences in Salmonella recovery incidence were identified in any single flock or combined data when evaluated. These data suggest that focus on organoleptic parameters of inspection may result in disappointing microbiologic improvements in broiler carcass quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimentally investigate the influence of vent type (side, roof, or both) and of anti-aphid insect screens on airflow, air temperature, and air vapor pressure deficit distribution in a round arch, mono-span greenhouse with vertical side walls. The greenhouse was equipped with two side roll-up <b>vents</b> and a <b>flap</b> roof <b>vent.</b> A tomato crop planted in double rows was cultivated inside the greenhouse. The three components of air velocity were measured by a 3 -D sonic anemometer, and the air temperature and relative humidity were, simultaneously recorded at several positions inside the greenhouse. Concerning the effect of insect screens, {{it was found that}} the mean value of the normalized air velocity was 58 % lower in the greenhouse with insect screens on the side vent openings than in the case of a greenhouse without screens. Furthermore, the spatial heterogeneity of the microclimate variables was reduced with screens in the vent openings. When the ventilation was provided by side openings only, the air velocity inside the greenhouse was characterized by a strong air current near the greenhouse ground and low air velocity near the roof; when the ventilation was provided by roof vents, a circulating current prevailing at the center of the greenhouse was observed. The combined use of roof and side openings increased air velocity and decreased air temperature inside the greenhouse but also increased the spatial heterogeneity of the greenhouse microclimate compared to the cases with side or roof vents only. The most homogeneous climate conditions were achieved with the use of roof openings only. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the plant environment behavior under different vent configurations and a high-resolution database for validating on-going efforts with computer simulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimentally investigate the influence of vent type (side, roof or both) and of an anti-aphid insect screen used to prevent insect intrusion on the ventilation rate of a round arch with vertical side walls, polyethylene covered greenhouse. The greenhouse was equipped with two side roll-up <b>vents</b> and a <b>flap</b> roof <b>vent</b> located at the University of Thessaly near Velestino in the continental area of Eastern Greece. Microclimate variables {{as well as the}} airflow rate were measured during summer. Two measuring methods were used for the determination of ventilation rate: (a) the decay rate 'tracer gas' method, using nitrous oxide N 2 O as tracer gas, and (b) the greenhouse 'energy balance' method. In order to study the effect of vent type on ventilation rate, in a greenhouse with an anti-aphid insect screen in the vent openings, airflow was determined during periods with ventilation being performed by: (i) roof, (ii) side or (iii) both roof and side vents. Furthermore, in order to study the effect of insect proof screen on airflow, measurements were also carried out during periods that ventilation was performed by side vents without a screen in the openings. A good correlation was found between the air exchange rate values calculated using the two methods, with the values obtained by the tracer gas method being slightly lower than those obtained by the energy balance method. Furthermore, the data of ventilation rate obtained by the tracer gas method fitted better to the model used for the prediction of ventilation rate. In addition, the use of anti-aphid screen in vent openings caused a 33 % reduction in greenhouse ventilation rate. From greenhouse ventilation performance point of view, {{it was found that the}} most effective vent configuration was the combination of roof and side vents, followed by side vents only (46 % reduction in ventilation), while the least effective was roof vent (71 % reduction ventilation). © 2006 Silsoe Research Institute...|$|R
