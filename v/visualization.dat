40|$|Static <b>visualizations</b> have {{analytic}} {{and expressive}} value. However, many interactive tasks cannot be completed using static <b>visualizations.</b> As datasets grow {{in size and}} complexity, static <b>visualizations</b> start losing their analytic and expressive power for interactive data exploration. Despite this limitation of static <b>visualizations,</b> {{there are still many}} cases where <b>visualizations</b> are limited to being static (e. g., <b>visualizations</b> on presentation slides or posters). We believe in many of these cases, static <b>visualizations</b> will benefit from allowing users to perform interactive tasks on them. Inspired by the introduction of numerous commercial personal augmented reality (AR) devices, we propose an AR solution that allows interactive data exploration of datasets on static <b>visualizations.</b> In particular, we present a prototype system named VisAR that uses the Microsoft Hololens to enable users to complete interactive tasks on static <b>visualizations...</b>|$|R

We first define multi-attribute choice tasks, a type of decision task commonly performed with such <b>visualizations.</b> We then identify which of the existing multidimensional <b>visualizations</b> are compatible with such tasks, and set out to evaluate three elementary visualizations: parallel coordinates, scatterplot matrices and tabular <b>visualizations.</b> Our method consists in first giving participants low-level analytic tasks, {{in order to ensure that}} they properly understood the <b>visualizations</b> and their interactions. Participants are then given multi-attribute choice tasks consisting of choosing holiday packages. We assess decision support through multiple objective and subjective metrics, including a decision accuracy metric based on the consistency between the choice made and self-reported preferences for attributes. We found the three <b>visualizations</b> to be comparable on most metrics, with a slight advantage for tabular <b>visualizations.</b> In particular, tabular <b>visualizations</b> allow participants to reach decisions faster. Thus, although decision time is typically not central in assessing decision support, it can be used as a tie-breaker when <b>visualizations</b> achieve similar decision accuracy. Our results also suggest that indirect methods for assessing choice confidence may allow to better distinguish between <b>visualizations</b> than direct ones. We finally discuss the limitations of our methods and directions for future work, such as the need for more sensitive metrics of decision support...|$|R
