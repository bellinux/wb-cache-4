40|$|Separation and {{purification}} of {{lactic acid}} from the fermentation broth are {{difficult because of}} its nonvolatile nature {{and the presence of}} other organic acids. Esterification of lactic acid with methanol followed by hydrolysis of the separated methyl lactate is an effective technique for this purpose. A continuous process for recovery is proposed and various aspects are evaluated through simulation and experiments. In the proposed route, a <b>vapor</b> <b>stream</b> <b>containing</b> methyl lactate is removed from a two-phase CSTR, used for esterification, operated under boiling conditions. The ester thus separated from the aqueous solution is further hydrolyzed in a reactive distillation column. Continuous removal of the volatile component (i. e. methanol) from the reaction zone increases conversion, thus pure lactic acid is obtained from the bottom of reactive distillation column. The results obtained in the experiments are compared with the simulation results. Further simulation studies were performed to obtain the suitable operating conditions for higher conversion and concentration of lactic acid. (c) 2006 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E

40|$|Natural gas must be {{dehydrated}} {{before it}} can be transported and used, but conventional drying agents such as activated alumina or inorganic molecular sieves require an energy-intensive desiccant-regeneration step. We report a hydrolytically stable fluorinated metal-organic framework, AlFFIVE- 1 -Ni (KAUST- 8), with a periodic array of open metal coordination sites and fluorine moieties within the contracted square-shaped one-dimensional channel. This material selectively removed water <b>vapor</b> from gas <b>streams</b> <b>containing</b> CO 2, N 2, CH 4, and higher hydrocarbons typical of natural gas, as well as selectively removed both H 2 O and CO 2 in N 2 -containing streams. The complete desorption of the adsorbed water molecules contained by the AlFFIVE- 1 -Ni sorbent requires relatively moderate temperature (~ 105 °C) and about half the energy input for commonly used desiccants...|$|R
50|$|Stripping is a {{physical}} separation process where one or more components are removed from a liquid <b>stream</b> by a <b>vapor</b> <b>stream.</b> In industrial applications the liquid and <b>vapor</b> <b>streams</b> can have co-current or countercurrent flows.

25|$|Thermal {{oxidation}} (or incineration) {{can also}} be an effective remediation technology. This approach is somewhat controversial because of the risks of dioxins released in the atmosphere through the exhaust gases or effluent off-gas. Controlled, high temperature incineration with filtering of exhaust gases however should not pose any risks. Two different technologies can be employed to oxidize the contaminants of an extracted <b>vapor</b> <b>stream.</b> The selection of either thermal or catalytic depends on the type and concentration in parts per million by volume of constituent in the <b>vapor</b> <b>stream.</b> Thermal oxidation is more useful for higher concentration (~4,000 ppmV) influent <b>vapor</b> <b>streams</b> (which require less natural gas usage) than catalytic oxidation at ~2,000 ppmV.|$|R
25|$|Vapor {{condensation}} is {{the most}} effective off-gas treatment technology for high (over 4,000 ppmV) VOC concentration <b>vapor</b> <b>streams.</b> The process involves cryogenically cooling the <b>vapor</b> <b>stream</b> to below 40 degrees C such that the VOCs condensate out of the <b>vapor</b> <b>stream</b> and into liquid form where it is collected in steel containers. The liquid form of the VOCs is referred to as dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL) when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of solvents or light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of petroleum or fuel products. This recovered chemical can then be reused or recycled in a more environmentally sustainable or green manner than the alternatives described above. This technology is also known as cryogenic cooling and compression (C3-Technology).|$|R

2500|$|Soil vapor {{extraction}} (SVE) is {{an effective}} remediation technology for soil. [...] "Multi Phase Extraction" [...] (MPE) is also an effective remediation technology when soil and groundwater are to be remediated coincidentally. SVE and MPE utilize different technologies to treat the off-gas volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generated after vacuum removal of air and vapors (and VOCs) from the subsurface and include granular activated carbon (most commonly used historically), thermal and/or catalytic oxidation and vapor condensation. Generally, carbon is used for low (below 500 ppmV) VOC concentration <b>vapor</b> <b>streams,</b> oxidation is used for moderate (up to 4,000 ppmV) VOC concentration <b>streams,</b> and <b>vapor</b> condensation is used for high (over 4,000 ppmV) VOC concentration <b>vapor</b> <b>streams.</b> Below is a brief summary of each technology.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{is directed}} toward a vapor-liquid heat and/or mass exchange device {{that can be used}} in an integrated heat and/or mass transfer system. To achieve high heat and mass transfer rates, optimal temperature profiles, size reduction and performance increases, appropriately sized flow passages with microscale features, and countercurrent flow configurations between working fluid solution, <b>vapor</b> <b>stream,</b> and/or the coupling fluid in one or more functional sections of the desorber are implemented. In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a desorber section utilizes a heating fluid flowing in a generally upward direction and a concentrated solution flowing in a generally downward direction with gravity countercurrent to the rising desorbed <b>vapor</b> <b>stream.</b> To further increase the efficiency of the system, various types of column configurations can be used.
