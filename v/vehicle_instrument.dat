40|$|DISCUSSION: The {{on-board}} diagnostics II (OBD II) regulation requires all vehicle manufacturers to monitor virtually every emission-control component and {{system that can}} cause increases in emissions. When an emission-related malfunction is detected, the OBD II system alerts the vehicle owner by illuminating the malfunction indicator light (MIL) on the <b>vehicle</b> <b>instrument</b> panel. By alerting the owner of malfunctions as they occur, repairs can be sought promptly, which results in fewer emissions from the vehicle. Manufacturers began phase-in of the OBD II requirements in 1994, with full implementation required on all 1996 and newer model year vehicles.

40|$|Minimizing astronaut's {{short and}} {{long-term}} medical risks arising from exposure to ionizing radiation during space missions {{is a major concern}} for NASA's manned spaceflight program, particularly exploration missions. For ethical and legal reasons, NASA follows the "as low as reasonably achievable" (ALARA) principal in managing astronaut's radiation exposures. One implementation of ALARA is the response to space weather events. Of particular concern are energetic solar particle events, and in low Earth orbit (LEO), electron belt enhancements. To properly respond to these events, NASA's Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG), in partnership with the NOAA Space Environment Center (SEC), provides continuous flight support during U. S. manned missions. In this partnership, SEC compiles space weather data from numerous ground and space based assets and makes it available in near real-time to SRAG (along with alerts and forecasts), who in turn uses these data as input to models to calculate estimates of the resulting exposure to astronauts. These calculations and <b>vehicle</b> <b>instrument</b> data form the basis for real-time recommendations to flight management. It is also important to implement ALARA during the design phase. In order to appropriately weigh the risks associated with various shielding and vehicle configuration concepts, the expected environment must be adequately characterized for nominal and worst case scenarios for that portion of the solar cycle and point in space. Even with the best shielding concepts and materials in place (unlikely), there will be numerous occasions where the crew is at greater risk due to being in a lower shielded environment (short term transit or lower shielded vehicles, EVAs), so that accurate space weather forecasts and nowcasts, of particles at the relevant energies, will be crucial to protecting crew health and safety...|$|E

ESA/ESTEC, Noordwijk, The Netherlands. On-line Proceedings. (2008). A {{preliminary}} baseline {{design for}} the ExoMars IDA is the Beagle 2 (B 2) arm, and the AU study has made extensive use of the B 2 Development Model (DM) arm [Barnes- 02, Barnes- 03] {{which was part of}} the B 2 Ground Test Model (GTM) situated at the Lander Operations Control Centre (LOCC), National Space Centre (NSC), Leicester UK. A test rig has been built that emulates the base and front sections of the ExoMars rover vehicle, and this has been raised to the proposed rover base height above nominal ground level. The B 2 DM arm has been mounted on this rig, and electronics built to provide the necessary motor drive interface and low level joint motor speed control. The electronics also provides an interface to computing hardware for arm control input and joint angular feedback purposes. The entire test rig with B 2 DM arm, electronics and computing is situated within the AU Planetary Analogue Terrain Laboratory (PATLab). As well as Mars Soil Simulant-D and target rocks, the PATLab has a twelve camera Vicon motion tracking system which has been used to provide arm positional and angular ground truth measurements throughout the IDA study. The study commenced with a repeat of the B 2 DM arm positional repeatability and accuracy measurements originally conducted over 5 years ago. During the B 2 mission the arm was to be moved joint-by-joint and employed a bang-bang [Sonneborn- 65] joint motor control method, i. e. there was no simultaneous multiple joint motion, and no joint motor speed control. Given the demands of the future ExoMars mission, more advanced arm control methods will be required, and the AU study has involved the design, implementation and testing of a new joint-interpolated-motion algorithm which allows straight line manipulator control [Taylor- 79]. A similar approach has been adopted for the two NASA Mars Exploration Rovers [Baumgartner- 05]. Our work has culminated in the porting and demonstration of our autonomous arm placement control methods using the B 2 DM arm and IDA test rig. This paper describes the work that we have undertaken for our Phase B 1 IDA operation requirements study. Our results are presented together with a comprehensive list of recommendations that must be adhered to in order to achieve the proposed ExoMars IDA surface operation requirements...|$|E
