50|$|Despite the township's {{proximity}} to the St. Lawrence River, only {{ten percent of the}} area's water drains into the St. Lawrence, and ninety percent drains into the South Nation River. The flow of the South Nation river through this area is described as <b>very</b> sluggish with <b>poor</b> <b>drainage,</b> due to the fact there is little drop in elevation along the river; this leads to the formation of bogs and swamps, and also makes the area prone to seasonal flooding. The north-west section of the township is known as the Groveton Bog, and to the east is known as the Hellgate Swamp. The soils in the area range from sandy and dry, to dark and acidic closer to the swamp areas.|$|R

As shown in the Fig.  13 a, role of the all indices is close together. It evidences that the all selected parameters (the main indices) are important and reasonable. According to Fig.  13 b, c, d, rural population to total population, total economically active population in agriculture to total economically active population, and difference between NRI and irrigation water requirement have the minimum effect (with the exception of percentage of total cultivated area drained due to <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> <b>drainage</b> in Africa) on estimation of land use policy index.

Although ability of the Eqs.  8 and 9 was proved according to the text, accuracy of them was determined using the Eqs.  12 – 14.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Preservation of mangroves, a very {{significant}} ecosystem from a social, economic, and environmental viewpoint, requires knowledge on soil composition, genesis, morphology, and classification. These aspects are of paramount importance to understand the dynamics of sustainability and preservation of this natural resource. In this study mangrove soils in the Subaé river basin were described and classified and inorganic waste concentrations evaluated. Seven pedons of mangrove soil were chosen, five under fluvial influence and two under marine influence and analyzed for morphology. Samples of horizons and layers were collected for physical and chemical analyses, including heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Mn, Zn, and Fe). The moist soils were suboxidic, with Eh values below 350 mV. The pH level of the pedons under fluvial influence ranged from moderately acid to alkaline, while the pH in pedons under marine influence was around 7. 0 throughout the profile. The concentration of cations in the sorting complex for all pedons, independent of fluvial or marine influence, indicated the following order: Na+>Mg 2 +>Ca 2 +>K+. Mangrove soils from the Subaé river basin under fluvial and marine influence had different morphological, physical, and chemical characteristics. The highest Pb and Cd concentrations {{were found in the}} pedons under fluvial influence, perhaps due to their closeness to the mining company Plumbum, while the concentrations in pedon P 7 were lowest, due to greater distance from the factory. For containing at least one metal above the reference levels established by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (United States Environmental Protection Agency), the pedons were classified as potentially toxic. The soils were classified as Gleissolos Tiomórficos Órticos (sálicos) sódico neofluvissólico in according to the Brazilian Soil Classification System, indicating potential toxicity and <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> <b>drainage,</b> except for pedon P 7, which was classified in the same subgroup as the others, but different in that the metal concentrations met acceptable standards...|$|E
