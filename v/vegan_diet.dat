50|$|Deckers {{recognises}} {{that many}} people believe that <b>vegan</b> <b>diets</b> are nutritionally deficient, which is why the appendix of the book engages with the nutritional literature, concluding that carefully chosen <b>vegan</b> <b>diets</b> are nutritionally adequate.|$|R

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly known as the American Dietetic Association), adds that well-planned <b>vegan</b> <b>diets</b> are also appropriate for older adults and athletes, and that <b>vegan</b> <b>diets</b> can {{reduce the risk of}} certain health conditions, including ischemic heart disease (coronary artery disease), type 2 diabetes, hypertension, certain types of cancer, obesity, and chronic disease.|$|R

On February 11, 2010, he was rushed to NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan after complaining of chest pains, and he had two coronary stents implanted in his heart. After this procedure, Clinton adopted the plant-based whole foods (<b>vegan)</b> <b>diet,</b> which had been recommended by doctors Dean Ornish and Caldwell Esselstyn.|$|E
5|$|Men wear tzitzit {{on their}} African print shirts, women follow the niddah (biblical laws {{concerning}} menstruation), and newborn boys are circumcised.

5|$|Animal-sourced foods (meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, dairy) provide zinc. The {{concentration}} of zinc in plants {{varies with the}} level in the soil. With adequate zinc in the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds (sesame, poppy, alfalfa, celery, mustard). Zinc {{is also found in}} beans, nuts, almonds, whole grains, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and blackcurrant. Plant phytates interfere with zinc absorption, so people consuming a vegetarian or <b>vegan</b> <b>diet</b> may need to increase zinc intake.|$|E
50|$|Many {{charges have}} been pressed against <b>vegan</b> <b>diets,</b> for example that they {{alienate}} human beings from nature (Michael Pollan) or that they increase human food security and other sustainability concerns relative to other diets (Simon Fairlie). Deckers addresses these challenges. The book’s appendix also considers whether <b>vegan</b> <b>diets</b> might be nutritionally adequate or even superior compared to other diets.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vegan</b> <b>diets</b> tend to {{be higher}} in dietary fibre, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron and phytochemicals, and lower in dietary energy, {{saturated}} fat, cholesterol, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc and vitamin B12. Well-planned <b>vegan</b> <b>diets</b> can {{reduce the risk of}} some types of chronic disease, including heart disease. They are regarded as appropriate for all stages of the life-cycle by the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, while the German Society for Nutrition does not recommend <b>vegan</b> <b>diets</b> for babies, children and adolescents, and during pregnancy and lactation. As a result of the elimination of all animal products, <b>vegan</b> <b>diets</b> can lead to significant nutritional deficiencies, most importantly vitamin B12 deficiency, that can nullify their beneficial effects for health and cause serious health consequences. These deficiencies can be prevented through the choice of fortified foods or the regular intake of dietary supplements.|$|R

5|$|At certain dates, food may be set {{out as a}} {{sacrifice}} to {{the spirits of the}} deceased or the gods, such as during the Qingming Festival. This may include slaughtered animals, such as pigs and ducks, or fruit. Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of Joss paper, or Hell Bank Notes, on the assumption that images thus consumed by the fire will reappear—not as a mere image, but as the actual item—in the spirit world, making them available for revered ancestors and departed loved ones. At other points, a <b>vegan</b> <b>diet</b> or full fast may be observed.|$|E
5|$|Mills booked {{herself into}} the Hippocrates Health Institute in Florida, which put her on a raw food <b>vegan</b> <b>diet,</b> using wheat grass and garlic poultices to heal her wound. After an operation, Mills {{discovered}} {{that she had been}} previously identified as having an O rhesus negative blood type, when in fact she was A rhesus negative, which had interfered with her attempts to follow the so-called blood type diet. As her prosthetic leg had to be replaced on a regular basis, because the size of the amputated stump kept changing as it healed, she had the idea to collect thousands of discarded prosthetic limbs for amputees in Croatia. Mills persuaded the Brixton prison governor to get inmates to dismantle and pack the prosthetic limbs before being transported, which resulted in 22,000 amputees obtaining limbs in addition to the Croatian citizens who were already supplied with prosthetic limbs by the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance, which paid for the fitting of limbs and rehabilitation of patients. The first convoy of limbs arrived in Zagreb in October 1994 and Mills travelled with the convoy to film interviews with some of the recipients for the Good Morning with Anne and Nick daytime TV show. She received an award in 2001 from Croatia's prime minister, Ivica Račan for the money she raised to help clear that country of landmines.|$|E

These deficiencies can only be prevented through the choice of fortified foods or the regular intake of dietary supplements. Vitamin B12 supplementation is especially important because its deficiency causes blood disorders and potentially irreversible neurological damage.|$|R

25|$|Raw veganism, {{combining}} veganism and raw foodism, excludes all {{animal products}} and food cooked above 48°C (118°F).

[...] Nonetheless, well-balanced vegetarian and <b>vegan</b> <b>diets</b> can meet all these nutrient requirements and {{are appropriate for}} all stages of the life cycle, including during pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence.

50|$|Chapter two {{culminates in}} the {{development}} of a theory which Deckers calls qualified moral veganism. His commitment to veganism is qualified as Deckers’s theory does not demand that people abstain from eating animal products in all situations. It is a moral rather than a dietary position that can be adopted by everyone, even by those who have very good reasons not to adopt <b>vegan</b> <b>diets.</b> It is a vegan theory in the sense that <b>vegan</b> <b>diets</b> ought to be the default diets for the majority of the human population.|$|R
25|$|As of 2014 {{very few}} studies were {{rigorous}} in their comparison of omnivore, vegetarian and vegan diets, {{making it difficult}} to discern whether health benefits attributed to the <b>vegan</b> <b>diet</b> might also apply to vegetarian diets or diets that include a moderate meat intake.|$|E

25|$|The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada {{state that}} {{properly}} planned vegan diets {{are appropriate for}} all life stages, including pregnancy and lactation. They indicate that vegetarian diets may be more common among adolescents with eating disorders, but that its adoption may serve to camouflage a disorder rather than cause one. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council similarly recognizes a well-planned <b>vegan</b> <b>diet</b> as viable for any age. The British National Health Service's Eatwell Plate allows for an entirely plant-based diet, as does the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) MyPlate. The USDA allows tofu to replace meat in the National School Lunch Program.
