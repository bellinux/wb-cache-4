40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the problem of {{creating}} <b>vulnerability</b> signatures. A <b>vulnerability</b> signature matches all exploits of a given <b>vulnerability,</b> even polymorphic or metamorphic variants. Our work departs from previous approaches {{by focusing on the}} semantics of the program and <b>vulnerability</b> exercised by a sample exploit instead of the semantics or syntax of the exploit itself. We show the semantics of a <b>vulnerability</b> define a language which contains all and only those inputs that exploit the <b>vulnerability.</b> A <b>vulnerability</b> signature is a representation (e. g., a regular expression) of the <b>vulnerability</b> language. Unlike exploitbased signatures whose error rate can only be empirically measured for known test cases, the quality of a <b>vulnerability</b> signature can be formally quantified for all possible inputs. We provide a formal definition of a <b>vulnerability</b> signature and investigate the computational complexity of creating and matching <b>vulnerability</b> signatures. We also systematically explore the design space of <b>vulnerability</b> signatures. We identify three central issues in vulnerability-signature creation: how a <b>vulnerability</b> signature represents the set of inputs that may exercise a <b>vulnerability,</b> the <b>vulnerability</b> coverage (i. e., number of vulnerable program paths) that is subject to our analysis during signature creation, and how a <b>vulnerability</b> signature is then created for a given representation and coverage. We propose new data-flow analysis and novel adoption of existing techniques such as constraint solving for automatically generating <b>vulnerability</b> signatures. We have built a prototype system to test our techniques. Our experiments show that we can automatically generate a <b>vulnerability</b> signature using a single exploit which is of much higher quality than previous exploit-based signatures. In addition, our techniques have several other security applications, and thus may be of independent interest. ...|$|R

5|$|All {{enemies are}} {{protected}} by health, shields, armor, barriers, or a combination thereof. Each type of protection has its own <b>vulnerabilities.</b> For example, armor is usually vulnerable to powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and to weapons with a low rate of fire such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, shields are vulnerable to powers such as Overload and to rapid-firing weapons like submachine guns and assault rifles. Barriers are typically used by boss-type enemies and are vulnerable to certain weapons and powers. When the shields, armor, or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them. Other powers may temporary benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in bullet time. Powers do not require any sort of expendable resource; they only have a global refresh time period.|$|E

40|$|A {{state is}} defi ned as “failed ” or “fragile ” {{when it is}} unable to perform its core {{functions}} and displays <b>vulnerability</b> in the social, political, and economic domains.

Failed States Index (FSI) data of 149 countries for the year 2007 has been used. The results support the hypothesis that there is a great degree of simultaneity in the <b>vulnerability</b> in these three domains and together they determine a country’s fragility/stability. It is seen that social <b>vulnerability</b> impacts political and economic <b>vulnerability</b> signifi cantly, whereas political <b>vulnerability</b> has a defi nite effect on social <b>vulnerability</b> but not on economic <b>vulnerability.</b> Economic <b>vulnerability</b> has a limited effect on the <b>vulnerability</b> in the other two spheres – in the sense that a single dimension alone (either income level or income inequality but not both) appears to impact <b>vulnerability</b> in the social and political domains.

40|$|<b>Vulnerability</b> studies {{look into}} the impact of hazard events on socio-ecological systems. Socio-ecological <b>vulnerability</b> {{is a very complex}} subject because it is not only a {{technical}} matter but also a social problem. Precise assessment of socio-ecological <b>vulnerability</b> can help people successfully reduce potential losses caused by disasters as well as provide decision support for decision makers to take different urban planning strategies in areas of different <b>vulnerability</b> levels when making development and construction.   In previous studies, the definition of <b>vulnerability</b> is vague, which leads to diverse <b>vulnerability</b> framework. <b>Vulnerability</b> assessment is hazard-specific, most <b>vulnerability</b> studies are centered on a certain hazard, such as floods. To evaluate <b>vulnerability,</b> previous literatures combined qualitative and quantitative methods, such as narrative interviews, uniform <b>vulnerability</b> level ranking systems, statistical methods, GIS methods, etc. GIS methods are especially widely used in <b>vulnerability</b> studies. However, because of the complexity and vagueness of <b>vulnerability,</b> previous studies did not reach a consensus, even on the framework. The most focuses of flood <b>vulnerability</b> researches at city level are put on big coastal cities, while small & medium inland cities which also suffer severe flood disasters are usually ignored. A flood <b>vulnerability</b> map with <b>vulnerability</b> level from high to low is usually created in previous flood <b>vulnerability</b> assessment studies. However, this kind of flood <b>vulnerability</b> map can only tell the general flood risk states, ignoring the inherent details, which may confuse decision makers.   Considering these problems, the objective of this research is to put forward a socio-ecological <b>vulnerability</b> assessment framework. As most previous researches suggested, the socio-ecological <b>vulnerability</b> is a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptation. In this research, the <b>vulnerability</b> is classified into 27 situations. The exposure, sensitivity, and adaptation are grading into three levels respectively. Of course, more levels can be used, but a three-level system, including high, medium, and low, is sufficient enough to describe the state of a place. Each <b>vulnerability</b> situation is a combination of a state of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptation. In this case, the <b>vulnerability</b> map makes it easier for decision makers to understand the inner structure of <b>vulnerability</b> level. This framework is applied to Guang’an, an inland medium-sized Chinese city which has suffered severe flood disasters. Flood is considered as the hazard. The assessment parts of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptation involve different data sets and methodologies. By an overlay analysis of these assessment results, the flood <b>vulnerability</b> map is derived. According to different situations in the flood <b>vulnerability</b> map, different coping strategies are given. Finally, a flood <b>vulnerability</b> assessments tool based on python script and model builder in ArcGIS 10. 2 and a GIS app based on ArcGIS Engine 10. 2 are created. This ArcGIS tool can be applied to other cities, making the <b>vulnerability</b> framework and methodologies proposed in this research be widely used. The GIS app is used to store some useful information of Guang’an and show the <b>vulnerability</b> results, which can be used directly by decision makers...|$|R
