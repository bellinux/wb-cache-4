40|$|Natural thorium radioisotopes (232 Th, 230 Th, 228 Th, 234 Th) {{are well}} known to be {{particle}} reactive, thus they are often used to study the geochemical process of particle reactive matter. In this study, water samples were collected from Langkawi Island and Pangkor Island from six and ten sampling stations respectively, to determine the activity of 232 Th, 230 Th and 228 Th in dissolved (DISS) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) phases, and estimate the sources and origin of SPM into the marine environment. The results in terms of <b>volume</b> <b>activity</b> <b>concentration</b> (mBq/L) shows that the activity level of 228 ThDISS was higher than 228 ThSPM at all sampling stations possibly due to the behaviour of the 228 Th parent, 228 Ra which is easily desorbed from SPM. At several stations far from the coast; stations L 4 (4. 58 km), P 7 (3. 16 km), P 6 (2. 1 km), P 10 (1. 38 km), the activity of 232 ThDISS was higher compared to 232 ThSPM. These stations behave {{the same way as}} the open ocean in which 232 ThDISS is contributed by atmospheric dust. Indeed, the partition of thorium between dissolved and SPM phase can be used to detect anthropogenic organic pollution as in station L 6 in which thorium activity in dissolved phase is higher compared to in SPM phase. Moreover, the use of the (232 Th/ 230 Th) SPM ratio is useful to detect lithogenic input to the marine environment in which the ratio ranges from 0. 13 to 0. 5 and 0. 7 to 3. 16 for stations that are far and near to the coast respectively, except for station P 1. However the data analysis shows that there is no clear pattern of kd values at both sampling sites, probably due to the adsorption and desorption processes of 232 Th and 230 Th that occurs in the water column. Nevertheless, as the SPM concentration (mg/L) increases, the kd value decreases except for the activity of 228 Th which shows a strong negative correlation with SPM...|$|E
30|$|The phantom study (Fig.  1) {{showed that}} both systems {{provided}} very close <b>volume</b> and <b>activity</b> <b>concentration</b> values. For fillable sphere volume, mCT gave 9.97  ml and mMR gave 10.08  ml, respectively. The true value is 8.0  ml, {{but due to}} scatter, both modalities overestimated <b>volume.</b> For <b>activity</b> <b>concentration,</b> the values were 115.0  MBq/ml and 113.8  MBq/ml for mCT and mMR, respectively. These results show that in our studies, these two systems are very closely calibrated for 90 Y, i.e., less than 1 % difference. However, the phantom study does not suffer from motion artifacts due to breathing, or from errors in attenuation correction, because the phantom has a uniform shape {{and it does not}} contain any bony structures.|$|R
30|$|The {{accuracy}} of semi-automatic segmentation {{is affected by}} a number of factors coupled to the characteristics of SPECT images. In Monte Carlo-simulated images a good tumour <b>volume</b> and <b>activity</b> <b>concentration</b> accuracy is obtained for two segmentation methods (Otsu method and Fourier surface method) when images are reconstructed with attenuation and scatter compensation, while if including resolution compensation underestimated <b>volumes</b> and overestimated <b>activity</b> <b>concentrations</b> are obtained. Using an adaptive surface based on Fourier descriptors has advantages if the image noise levels are high, for example if the tumour activity retention is to be followed {{for a long period of}} time. For images with less noise, for example early imaging time-points in the course of radionuclide therapy dosimetry, an adaptive thresholding algorithm like the Otsu method yields approximately equivalent results as the Fourier surface method. The results are encouraging for application in tumour dosimetry, although challenges can be foreseen due to the diversity of patient images. Further studies of the differences in tumour extension when visualized in functional SPECT and in morphological CT or MR images are of interest.|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{to better}} {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} the AD/A admin values, especially for red marrow, we used another more suitable phantom to model the in vivo conditions in terms of organ <b>volume</b> and <b>activity</b> <b>concentration.</b> With this phantom, the recovery coefficient obtained for the L 2 –L 4 model of 80  ml was in the same order of magnitude as the value obtained for a 16  ml sphere without background activity, possibly due to the high concentration gradient between the L 2 –L 4 model and kidney model.|$|R
30|$|Calibration was {{the process}} of {{establishing}} {{the relationship between the}} measured count rate per <b>volume</b> and true <b>activity</b> <b>concentration.</b> SPECT/CT images of the phantom with uniform activity in the entire intracranial cavity were used to calculate a cross-calibration factor for the relative sensitivity of the SPECT/CT scanner and well counter. The cross-calibration factor values were determined for reconstruction with the OSEM- 3 D method.|$|R
30|$|The voxel {{size in the}} {{clinical}} protocols {{used in this study}} is relatively large, a trade-off between sensitivity and spatial resolution. The volume of a voxel in the images in this study was 0.80  cm 3 in SPECT and 0.044  cm 3 in PET, which delimits the detection level of both the <b>volume</b> and the <b>activity</b> <b>concentration</b> of the smallest spheres in the NEMA phantom (0.52 and 1.15  cm 3).|$|R
30|$|For AS/AS the activity-concentration rRMSE for FT is 22 % to 56 %, for OM 5 % to 18 %, and for FS it is 3 % to 21 %. The {{corresponding}} {{results for}} AS/ASR are 11 % to 20 %, 2 % to 39 %, and 2 % to 24 %, for FT, OM, and FS, respectively. There are tendencies for {{direction of the}} activity-concentration error (i.e., underestimation versus overestimation) to depend on <b>volume,</b> with the <b>activity</b> <b>concentration</b> in small <b>volumes</b> being underestimated. For FT the best result are obtained for AS/ASR, with <b>activity</b> <b>concentration</b> rRMSEs within 20 %. For FS and OM, the <b>activity</b> <b>concentration</b> rRMSEs are typically within 10 % for the larger tumours using AS images for delineation and are for AS/AS within 21 % for all volumes. On the whole, the DSC is highest for the FS method applied to AS images, although the differences between OM and FS are relatively modest. For FT the DSC is generally lower. At the later time-point (336 h p.i. Table 2), the main difference compared to the 24 h results, apart from the failure of FT to produce meaningful VOIs, is a poorer performance for OM, {{especially in terms of}} DSC. Also in terms of <b>volume</b> and <b>activity</b> <b>concentration,</b> the FS method tends to yield better results than OM. For the four largest tumours, the volume rRMSE is between 10 % and 16 % when applying FS to AS images and the <b>activity</b> <b>concentration</b> rRMSE is within 10 % except for one case. Irrespective of tumour volume, the activity-concentration rRMSE is between 5 % and 22 % for these cases.|$|R
30|$|Different {{methods can}} be used to measure organ <b>activity</b> <b>concentrations</b> from single photon {{emission}} tomography (SPECT) with low-dose computed tomography (CT) for attenuation correction (SPECT/CT). The most frequently used method is to delineate the whole organ either in the anatomical (CT) or the functional (SPECT) image. A second method, introduced in earlier reports [15, 21], is to measure the concentration using a small VOI with a specified <b>volume</b> yielding the <b>activity</b> <b>concentration</b> in a defined small volume within the organ. Comparison between dosimetry based on manually delineated whole organ VOIs versus small VOIs on SPECT images has shown acceptable agreement [21].|$|R
30|$|It is {{desirable}} that distributions {{with the same}} total reduction of ventilation result in {{the same level of}} AUC(CVT) values independent of lesion shape and distribution. This is the case of the evenly distribution 4 and the clustered distribution 5 (with a total reduction of ventilation of 10 % to 12 %). However, the difference in distribution {{can be seen in the}} frequency functions (Figure  4) and in corresponding CV matrices (Figure  5). Clusters positioned in other parts of the lung have not been investigated. Factors influencing the result are the <b>volume</b> and <b>activity</b> <b>concentration</b> of the spheres in the cluster and the size of the cluster’s surface area towards the uniform part of the lung, and not where in the lung the cluster is positioned.|$|R

The activities were 740 MBq for XL and 300 MBq for L and M, and the acquisitions {{were set up}} so that the first projection contained 880 kcounts for XL, 670 kcounts for L, and 220 kcounts for M.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} different SPECT segmentation methods with automatic delineation {{for use in}} tumour dosimetry in 177 Lu-DOTATATE therapy. Absorbed-dose estimation is not addressed as such, but rather the accuracy of <b>volume</b> and <b>activity</b> <b>concentration</b> estimation from SPECT images. An accurate estimation of these two quantities is considered essential for an accurate absorbed-dose estimation. Three different segmentation methods are considered: thresholding using a fixed threshold relative to the maximum, a threshold that is automatically determined from the image information [20, 29], and deformable surfaces based on Fourier descriptors [22, 23, 28, 30]. The segmentation is evaluated with respect to volume, dice similarity coefficient (DSC) [31] and the tumour <b>activity</b> <b>concentration.</b> As image data, Monte Carlo-simulated SPECT images [32] of anthropomorphic computer XCAT phantoms [33, 34] coupled to a pharmacokinetic model of 177 Lu-DOTATATE [35] are used, and also a set of patient images where the tumour volumes obtained from SPECT image segmentation are compared to volumes obtained by manual delineation in diagnostic CT (computed tomography) or MR (magnetic resonance) images.|$|R
30|$|After injecting {{a phantom}} with a {{measured}} amount of 99 mTc, it was scanned using the standard patient protocol mentioned above. The collimator/detector heads are moved in {{as close as}} possible to the phantom, with a radius range of 24  cm right and left lateral, 20  cm anterior, and 22  cm posterior. A volume of interest (VOI) was drawn on the reconstructed image in order to obtain counts per second per <b>volume</b> (cc). The <b>activity</b> <b>concentration</b> (AC) was calculated based on the decay-corrected <b>activity</b> per phantom <b>volume</b> (cc) in units of cps per microcurie as shown in Eq.  1.|$|R
30|$|Despite the {{aforementioned}} {{limitations of the}} simulated images, {{they also have a}} number of advantages. In particular, the anatomy and activity distribution, {{through the use of a}} pharmacokinetic model coupled to the phantoms [35], are designed to be realistic substitutes for patient SPECT images, while at the same time establishing a ground truth with respect to <b>volume</b> and <b>activity</b> <b>concentration.</b> The simulations allow for calculation of the DSC for the tumours. It can here be noted that the comparisons are not performed between volumes with the same voxel sizes, and rather than counting the number of voxels contained in both sets the overlapping volume is considered. Hence, part of the mismatch between the volume defined as tumour in the phantoms and the volume classified as tumour in the SPECT images is due to the relation between the phantom-image grid and the SPECT-image grid, and the voxel volume becomes a factor that affects the calculated DSCs.|$|R

The IQ NEMA 2001 IEC body phantom was used to simulate the movement of neoplastic lesions in the thorax and abdomen, investigating the effect of: target size (10 37 mm), lesion-to-background <b>activity</b> <b>concentration</b> ratio (4 : 1 and 8 : 1), total acquisition time (3, 6, 12, 20 min), and number of phase partitions (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13).
