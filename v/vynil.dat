40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{relationship}} between popularization of politics, participation, and social media. It does so by investigating the case study Redundancy Island, a «real-reality show» which, starting from Facebook and a blog to then reach the mainstream media, has narrated the protest of workers on redundancy payment at <b>Vynils</b> factory at Porto Torres (north Sardinia). Those workers self-restrained {{for more than a year}} in the former prison of Asinara. The interviews to these «famed» blue-collar workers were made when they were at the height of popularity. The analysis initially focused on their perceptions of media success, aiming to understand the meaning assigned by the workers to both the «novelty» of their protest and the different forms of support they received from fan-like citizens. Moreover, by monitoring the Facebook group seven months after the occupation of Asinara, we could measure the workers' capability to upkeep the citizens' attention in this «reality 2. 0 ». The analysis suggests the interpretation of Redundancy Island as an emblematic (and well performed) attempt to reshape the account of both a specific dispute and the general crisis. It also shows evidence of a more general trend toward the popularization of protest, in a media eco-system «complicated» by the participative web typical of Facebook and blogs...|$|R

40|$|Moisture in {{the form}} of {{humidity}} has {{a significant impact on the}} operation of photovoltaic (PV) cells and panels. Moisture is often diffuse through the encapsulant film (Ethylene <b>Vynil</b> Acetate (EVA), PVB, PVF, PMMA) or the breathable back-sheet. Moisture is known to accelerate the degradation and reduce the performance of a PV while operating in a wet environment. SCAPS 1 D is widely used to simulate and estimate the operation of PV. In this work, we showed the effect of moisture on the operation and performance of a PV, made from monocrystalline silicon. Namely, the influence of defects and impurities generated by moisture was investigated. We studied the simultaneous effects of Silanlols (Si-OH), Hydrogen ions H^+, and the metallic ions generated from the corrosion of contacts, encapsulant and transparent conducting oxide (TCO) when there is production of acid (Al^ 3 +; Zn^ 2 +), or from dust (Fe^ 3 +). The numerical simulation showed that : starting with PV cells without moisture, the Fill Factor (FF) and the Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) drop respectively from 82. 80 % to 81. 78 % and 18. 57 % to 11. 46 %, when there is moisture in the cell and PVB used as encapsulant. Further degradation of parameters was observed, when the moisture leads to the production of acetic acid on the EVA, or when there is dust having iron (Fe). FF and PCE were further dropped to 79. 20 % and 7. 04 % respectively, using the same initial photovoltaic cells. Furthermore, a net decrease in key electrical parameters of the PV was observed throughout the study, with maximal power (P_max), the short circuit current (J_SC), the current density at maximum power J_MP reducing by more than 50 %. This study paves the way for the improvement of performance, and the understanding of degradation process in panels used in wet environments and tropical area...|$|E
40|$|In {{later years}} the {{operation}} of resecting the lower esophagus and the cardiac portion of the stomach including the esophago-cardio junction, combined with various methods of anastomosis, has become increasingly popular as a treatment of various diseases circumscribed to that area-benign lesions such as ulcer and polyps and malignant ones such as carcinoma and sarcoma. In an effort to assess the relative values of various procedures of anastomosis, investigations were carried out in clinical cases operated on in our clinic as well as experimental animals. The methods were evaluated based on technical difficulties involved in operation, postoperative complaints (especially esophagitis due to reflux, impairment {{to the passage of}} aliment through anastomosing part and dumping syndrome), digestion and assimilation, and long-range postoperative blood picture. The procedures employed clinically were esophagogastrostomy, interposition of jejunal loop between esophagus and antrum, esophagojejunostomy with antral exclusion, and esophagojejunostomy with gastrostomy at antrum. The operations done experimentally in mature dogs were esophagogastrostomy, esophagojejunostomy with antral exclusion, and esophagojejunostomy and antrojejunostomy. 1. Esophagogastrostomy. As compared with other operations, this operation is easiest to perform, involving the least hazard. It is the best method of anastomosis from the viewpoint of physiology. The rate of digestion and assimilation was nearly normal and dumping syndrome did not occur after this operation. Some cases developed esophagitis due to reflux and impairment to the passage of aliment through anastomosing part. Measures taken conservatively to cope with esophagitis due to reflux consisted of elevation of the upper half of patient 2 ̆ 7 s body and administration of anti-acid agent, antiphlogistic agent and adsorbent. The use of A. C. L. has achieved good results in our clinic. Surgically, pyloroplastic surgery and {{the operation of}} forming a valve in {{the lower end of the}} esophagus were the methods of value. Interposition of jejunal loop between esophagus and antrum proved to be the best method for the prevention of esophagitis. The following caution may be of value for the prevention of stricture of anastomosing part : to be careful to secure patency of anastomosing part, to leave a <b>vynil</b> tube in place in anastomosing part for a certain period of time, and to transect the esophagus obliquely. A bougie or a Laminaria may be used to effect gradual dilatation in cases of a high degree of stricture. 2. Interposition of Jejunal Loop between Esophagus and Antrum. This operation did not cause esophagitis due to reflux, impediment to the passage of aliment through anastomosing part, and dumping syndrome. Though it is a method of great value, its fault lies in the fact that the technique is very complicated. 3. Esophagojejunostomy with Antral Exclusion. After this operation, stricture of anastomosing part between jejunum and esophagus rarely occurred, but the rate of digestion and assimilation showed a slight decrease below normal. Besides, there were possibilities of the development of esophagitis due to reflux. 4. Esophagojejunostomy with Gastrostomy at Antrum. This operation has the advantage of being done comparatively easily in cases of poor risk, for the gastric fistula makes food intake possible at an early postoperative date. It is also to its credit that stricture may seldom occur at anastomosing part between esophagus and jejunum. Its faults are that it may cause a slight lowering of the rate of digestion and assimilation, and that it may cause dumping syndrome to occur. 5. Esophagojejunostomy and Antrojejunostomy. This operation is easier to perform than interposition of jejunal loop. Moreover, publication of jejunal limb will lead to the maintenance of a normal process of digestion and assimilation, and to the prevention of circulus vitiosus. No anemic symptoms were noticed in all the patients and experimental animals regardless of the type of operation performed. The following conclusions have been reached : from the viewpoint of physiology, esophagogastrostomy is the operation of choice for those cases in which resection of a small portion of the cardia seems to achieve the end. Either esophagogastrostomy with antralexclusion or gastrostomy is preferable in cases of poor risk. Interposition of jejunal loop between esophagus and antrum seems to be the best method in cases of good general condition, if importance is to be attached to the prevention of postoperative complications...|$|E

Objetivo: Discutir os aspectos físicos e mecânicos do balonete do tubo endotraqueal da marca RUSCH® formato globular de PVC (cloreto de polivinil) através de medições diretas do balonete insuflado e observar se há ocorrência de escoamento de solução através do balonete. Métodos: Para estudar os aspectos físicos foram feitas medições diretas (diâmetro e comprimento) do balonete insuflado a uma pressão de 30 cmH 20 com um paquímetro de precisão. As medidas indiretas foram obtidas a partir dos primeiros resultados (perímetro, área e peso). Para estudar os aspectos mecânicos através da análise do escoamento de solução através do balonete, foram desenvolvidos modelos experimentais {{in vitro}} e in vivo para avaliar a ocorrência de escoamento de secreções de maneira transversal e qualitativa. No estudo in vitro foram instilados 3 ml de solução de azul de metileno e observada a presença de escoamento da mesma através do balonete insuflado em 20 tubos em modelo de traqueia artificial. No estudo in vivo 3 ml da mesma solução foram instilados na rima oral 12 porcos da raça Large-White sob intubação endotraqueal. Imediatamente após o sacrifício a traqueia foi dissecada com o balonete ainda na mesma posição e foi avaliada presença ou não de tingimento na traqueia distal ao balonete. Todos os balonetes foram igualmente insuflados na pressão de 30 cm H 2 O. Resultados: Quanto aos aspectos físicos, a uma pressão de 30 cmH 20, há 640, 8 g de peso sendo exercido sobre a traqueia. Ainda sob essa pressão os canais longitudinais puderam ser demonstrados e observados nos estudos in vitro e in vivo. Em relação aos aspectos mecânicos, houve passagem de solução através dos balonetes em todos os modelos experimentais tanto in vitro como in vivo. Conclusões: O balonete dos tubos endotraqueais de PVC RUSCH® 6, 0 e 7, 5 mm não foram capazes de impedir o escoamento das soluções instiladas. Novos estudos que associem a custo-efetividade podem justificar a substituição do uso dos balonetes de PVC por modelos de balonetes com desempenho superior já existentes no mercado.;;Abstract:Introduction: The inflation {{pressure of the}} endotracheal tube cuff can either cause ischemia of the tracheal mucosa at high pressures or, if the cuff pressure is insufficient, tracheal microaspiration of the oropharyngeal secretion, increasing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Objectives: This {{study was designed to}} discuss the physical and mechanical aspects of the endotracheal tube cuff RUSCH® globular shaped in PVC (polichloride <b>vynil)</b> material through direct measurements of the inflated endotracheal tube cuff and to observe if leakage of solutions around de cuff do occur. Method: To study the physical aspects, direct measurements (diameter and length) were taken with a precision pachimeter with the cuff inflated at a 30 cmH 20 pressure. The indirect measurements (perimeter, surface area and weight) were obtained using the first results. In order to study the mechanical aspects, in vitro and in vivo experimental models were developed. In the in vitro study 3 ml of a methilene blue solution were instilled and it was observed the presence of leakage across the inflated cuff inside an artificial tracheal model. In the in vivo study, 3 ml of the same solution were instilled in the oral cavity of 12 Large White pigs under endotracheal intubation. Imediately after the sacrifice, the tracheas were dissected with the cuff still in the same position so the presence or abscence of blue dye below the cuff region on the tracheal wall could be investigated. All cuffs were equally inflated at the pressure of 30 cmH 2 O. Results: Physical aspects ¿ at a 30 cmH 20 pressure there is a 640, 8 g weight over the tracheal wall. Still under this pressure it was observed and demonstrated the presence of longitudinal channels in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Mechanical aspects: It was observed leakage of fluids through the cuff in all the 20 in vitro and 12 in vivo experiments. Conclusions: We conclude that the RUSCH® 6. 0 and 7. 5 mm endotracheal tube cuffs were not capable to develop a satisfactory seal of the trachea and thus not able to prevent aspiration of the instilled dye above the cuff. New studies relating the cost-effectiveness might justify the substitution of the PVC globular models for cuffs with superior seal capacity already available...|$|E
40|$|Sensing and {{recognition}} of bio-molecules is of extreme interest nowadays because it allows for detection of specific targets which can be the hallmarks of diseases. Colloidal particles {{can be used as}} a powerful platform to recognize bio-molecules and to perform a fast screening of them. Indeed, in most cases the surface of colloidal particles can be easily functionalized with agents which allow to control specific interaction between the particles and specific recognition. In addition, colloids with a switchable recognition mechanism, which can be externally triggered, would have a tremendous impact in the field of drug delivery and bio-sensing. “Smart” microgels are potentially suitable for these applications. They are extensively studied due to their swelling response to changes in specific environmental stimuli (i. e. pH, temperature, solute concentration, solvent composition, ionic strength, light, or electric field). While a variety of polymer systems have been explored, most attention has focused on microgels based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM). They exhibit an extreme response to changes in temperature. Linear PNIPAM has a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 32 °C in aqueous solution, at which point the polymer reversibly switches from a fully soluble, hydrophilic random coil at lower temperatures to an insoluble globule at higher temperatures. When cross-linked into a colloidal gel, PNIPAM-based microgels exhibit this temperature responsiveness by undergoing a reversible de-swelling volume phase transition between 32 and 35 °C (the volume phase transition temperature, VPTT). Smart environmental triggers can be incorporated into the PNIPAM microgels by co-polymerization, to provide multivariable control over the particle swelling like temperature and pH. The functionalization of PNIPAM microgels with carboxylic acid groups can provide these proprieties and can achieve several objectives. The VPTT behavior of the microgel can be controlled via carboxylic groups incorporation. Both the value of the VPTT and the breadth of the deswelling transition can be influenced through copolymerization of more hydrophilic monomers. Functionalization can also provide reactive sites for post-modification of the gel, such as the bioconjugation of ligands. Our work has consisted in synthesizing tunable thermo- and pH-responsive core-shell microgels based on N-Isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) coupled with <b>vynil</b> acetic acid (VAA) groups. Their volume sensitivity to pH and temperature were monitored by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and light scattering measurements. Ultra-structural analysis revealed core-shell architecture of the microgels with the core consisting of PNIPAM while the shell composed by PNIPAM and VAA. Volume change of the microgel in response to environmental pH and temperature were driven by separate mechanisms. Temperature sensitivity is conveyed mainly by the PNIPAM component while the pH sensitivity was imparted by the VAA component. As consequence, pH volume changes affected mainly the outer shell whereas the temperature volume change is localized both in the core and in the shell. Results indicated that by changing relative composition of NIPAM and VAA it is possible to tune the microgel VPTT and by changing the relative extension of core and shell compartment it is possible to tune the sensitivity of the gel to the environmental variation. Afterwards, we set out to investigate whether DNA conjugated microgels were compatible with hybridization process, which is commonly used for manipulations of DNA in the design of DNA bioassays or biosensors. First, we performed a Quenching experiment, in order to investigate the nature of the interaction of DNA fragments with microgel (physisorption vs hybridization) and thus, the specificity of hybridization on microgels. Cy 5 -labeled DNA oligonucleotide was conjugated with PNIPAM-VAA particles and by using a full complementary DNA oligonucleotide, opportunely modified with Black Hole Quencher 2 (BHQ- 2), we performed the quenching experiment. Once confirmed the capability of DNA conjugated microgels to catch and recognize specifically complementary DNA strands we analyzed the effect of temperature and pH on the hybridization event and its stability. The hybridization process was performed and tested in terms of specific catching of a complementary oligonucleotide and successively, it was studied in details, looking at the effect of microgel structural changes. The effect of the shrinkage controlled by temperature changes does not drive any de-hybridization process. No dependence of the hybridization process was highlighted during microgel conformation changing, neither when the shell has collapsed nor when it is fully extended outside the microgel. Even analyzing the process as function of the oligonucleotide exposure towards the complementary oligo sequence, there is no direct evidence of its effects on the interaction process between the two DNA strands. Eventually, DNA conjugated PNIPAM-VAA microgels charge proprieties were exploited for a reproducible and facile approach optimized for physisorption of gold nanoparticles. The advance of this approach consists in the simple mechanism by which gold nanoparticles are adsorbed on microgels templates, without dealing with sophisticated chemical treatment for their conjugation with the microgel. The resulted PNIPAAm- 40 nm gold nanoparticles modes demonstrate that this approach provides the capability to tune the interparticle distance and therefore to control and modulate the Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) affinity upon temperature changing...|$|E
