2500|$|So if , carrier {{amplitude}} {{varies by}} 50% above (and below) its unmodulated level, as {{is shown in}} the first waveform, below. For , it varies by 100% as shown in the illustration below it. With 100% modulation the wave amplitude sometimes reaches zero, and this represents full modulation using standard AM and is often a target (in order to obtain the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio) but mustn't be exceeded. Increasing the modulating signal beyond that point, known as overmodulation, causes a standard AM modulator (see below) to fail, as the negative excursions of the wave envelope cannot become less than zero, resulting in distortion ("clipping") of the received modulation. Transmitters typically incorporate a limiter circuit to avoid overmodulation, and/or [...] a compressor circuit (especially for voice communications) in order to still approach 100% modulation for maximum intelligibility above the noise. Such circuits are sometimes referred to as a <b>vogad.</b>|$|E
50|$|While {{clipping}} limiters {{are often}} used {{as a form of}} last-ditch protection against overmodulation, a properly designed <b>vogad</b> circuit actively controls the amount of gain to optimise the modulation depth in real time. As well as preventing overmodulation, it boosts the level of quiet signals so that undermodulation is also avoided. Undermodulation can lead to poor signal penetration in noisy conditions, consequently <b>vogad</b> is particularly important for voice applications such as radiotelephones.|$|E
5000|$|A good <b>vogad</b> circuit {{must have}} a very fast attack time, so that an initial loud voice signal does not cause a sudden burst of {{excessive}} modulation. In practice the attack time will be a few milliseconds, so a clipping limiter is still sometimes needed to catch the signal on these short peaks. A much longer decay time is usually employed, so that the gain does not get boosted too quickly during the normal pauses in natural speech. Too short a decay time leads to the phenomenon of [...] "breathing" [...] where the background noise level gets boosted at each gap in the speech. <b>Vogad</b> circuits are normally adjusted so that at low levels of input the signal is not fully boosted, but instead follow a linear boost curve. This works well with noise cancelling microphones.|$|E
50|$|A {{voice-operated}} gain-adjusting device or volume-operated gain-adjusting device (<b>vogad)</b> {{is a type}} of AGC or compressor for microphone amplification. It {{is usually}} used in radio transmitters to prevent overmodulation and to reduce the dynamic range of the signal which allows increasing average transmitted power. In telephony, this device takes a wide variety of input amplitudes and produces a generally consistent output amplitude.|$|E
