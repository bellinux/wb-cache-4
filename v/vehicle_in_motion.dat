50|$|A sand flag is a flag {{designed}} to be fitted {{to the front of}} off-road vehicles during operation on sandy or dusty terrain. It is mounted on a long (usually slender, whiplike) pole that projects high enough from the vehicle to be clearly visible above the dust or sand cloud generated while the <b>vehicle</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion.</b> The flag indicates the actual position of the vehicle within the cloud which can be important for safety reasons. Similar devices are often seen on vehicles such as sand rails - a small fluorescent triangle flag mounted {{to the rear of the}} vehicle, although in that case it also is helpful to allow other vehicles to see its location beyond the crest of a dune. It is similar, although generally larger and taller than, safety flags used by some bicyclists in urban areas, which allow them to be more visible when in front of a tall vehicle, or obscured by an object or vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|Wackel-Elvis was {{designed}} to portray musician and actor Elvis Presley {{around the time of}} the early 1970s. The dress of Wackel-Elvis resembles the white jumpsuit Elvis Presley wore in the 1973 Aloha from Hawaii television satellite broadcast. Other than most conventional bobblehead dolls, in which a flexible neck joint connects a wobbling head to a static figure that rests on a surface, Wackel-Elvis is attached to the inside of the windshield or rear window of a vehicle. The figure is suspended from a suction cup connecting to an adjustable elastic string which, at its other end, is attached to a loop on top of the head of the figure. On a sharply pointed nail, protruding approximately [...]2 in from the sole of the right foot of the figure, Wackel-Elvis stands on top of the dashboard or rear cargo cover. With the <b>vehicle</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion,</b> the left arm stretched away from the body of the figure produces centrifugal force, causing the figure to spin back and forth around its vertical axis. While spinning, the foot of the figure is held in place by the nail and its head held in place being suspended from the string. The left arm and hip of Wackel-Elvis wobble consistent with the vehicle motion, creating the illusion of Elvis Presley performing or dancing on stage.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{connected}} vehicle based approach {{to improve the}} throughput at signalized intersections and ultimately increase the mobility of a transportation system. Connected vehicle technology demonstrates tremendous potential for improving safety and mobility, as it enables the real-time sharing of vehicle data, including position, speed, acceleration, etc., not only among vehicles but also between vehicles and infrastructure. The proposed approach takes advantage of such real-time data to develop a strategy that maximizes throughput of an isolated intersection locally. Accordingly, the problem is formulated as a two-step centralized optimization. There are two main processes in this method: optimization for <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion,</b> and optimization for stopped vehicles. The first step maximizes the intersection throughput of <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> using advisory acceleration. The second one minimizes the total delay of the stopped vehicles by adjusting the positions at which vehicles stop. A case study is also presented to show {{the efficiency of the}} proposed approach, which improves the traffic flow throughput of an isolated signalized intersection and reduces the total delay of all vehicles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Abstract: For {{logistics}} centers {{the disposition}} and {{dispatch of goods}} has reached a high standard of automation. However, the trucks and trailers bringing and taking the goods are driven manually. This can at least be improved for the non-public traffic in the scope of logistics centers by autonomous forward and backward motion control for standard transportation vehicles. By an experimental system {{it has been shown}} that truck and trailer can be maneuvered autonomously at a high degree of precision. For purposes of safety it is necessary to guarantee that at any instant of time the vehicle is within some predefined area. Therefore this paper introduces the principle of safe cover segments which are never left by the <b>vehicle</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> and defines rules for the connection of such segments forming a safe corridor...|$|E
