In India, it earned $6.0million, a record opening for a Hollywood film. Its final box office collection in India was $20 million {{making it the}} eightth highest grossing Hollywood film in India of all time. Kercy Daruwala of Sony Pictures in India felt <b>very</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> the presence of famed Indian actor Irrfan Khan would enhance attendance.

China is also the movie's highest-grossing territory with $48.8 million.|$|E
25|$|In the {{academic}} world, plagiarism by students is usually considered {{a very serious}} offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on the particular assignment, the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution. Generally, the punishment increases as a person enters higher institutions of learning. The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism may be tempered by a recognition that students may not fully understand what plagiarism is. A 2015 study showed that students who were new to university study {{did not have a}} good understanding of even the basic requirements of how to attribute sources in written academic work, yet students were <b>very</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> they understood what referencing and plagiarism are. The same students also had a lenient view of how plagiarism should be penalised.|$|E

During a behind-the-scenes feature {{included on the}} DVD release of the show's second season, Bromanis explained that the writers and producers paid close attention to imagining a virus that could believably almost exterminate an entire species. Both Piller and Braga responded positively to Taylor's concept of the Vidiians. Piller viewed the idea of [...] "an alien culture who are a civilized people who are forced to do uncivilized things in order to survive" [...] as a compelling plot point. Braga agreed with Piller's assessment, saying: [...] "Very rarely do you stumble on something that has real resonance."

A spirit of good will prevails." [...] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post was critical, calling the series [...] "just as dull as it sounds," [...] and arguing that [...] "weariness" [...] could be detected in Foxworthy's hosting. Rebecca Cusey of Patheos recommended the series for Christians in particular, saying, [...] "Those that take the Bible as the word of God will enjoy this show."

2500|$|In November 2010, ISC and the Avondale City Council {{announced}} plans for a $100 million long-term development for Phoenix Raceway. $15 million would go towards repaving the track {{for the first time}} since 1990 and building a new media center. The plans also include a reconfiguration of the track. The front stretch was widened from 52 feet to , the pit stalls were changed from asphalt to concrete, the dogleg (between Turn 2 and Turn 3) was moved outward by , tightening the turn radius of the dogleg from 800 feet to 500 feet (152 m). Along with the other changes, progressive banking was added to the turns: Turns 1 and 2, which had 11 degrees of banking, changed to 10 degrees on the bottom and 11 degrees on the top. Turns 3 and 4, which had 9 degrees of banking, changed to 8 degrees on the bottom and 9 on the top. Project leader Bill Braniff, Senior Director of Construction for North American Testing Corporation (NATC), a subsidiary of Phoenix Raceway’s parent company International Speedway Corporation, said [...] "All of the changes – including the adjustment of the dog-leg – will be put in place in order to present additional opportunities for drivers to race side-by-side. We’re <b>very</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> we’ll have multi-groove racing at Phoenix from Day 1 because of the variable banking that will be implemented.” The infield road course was also sealed off and removed from use, making Phoenix Raceway an oval-only facility. The reconfiguration project was completed by mid-August 2011, and on August 29–30, five drivers tested the new track, describing the new dogleg and backstretch as a [...] "rollercoaster" [...] as now when they enter it dips, then rises on exit and dips down going into turn 3, due to the elevation changes. [...] On October 4–5, several NASCAR Cup Series teams tested the oval which was open to the public. Seven–eight million dollars went towards connecting the track property to the Avondale water and sewer systems. Work began following the 2011 Subway Fresh Fit 500.|$|E

If his cousin Florence would be good to him all might yet be well. He had come by that time to lose his assurance. He had recognized Harry Annesley as his enemy, as has been told often enough in these pages. Harry was to him a hateful stumbling-block. And he had not been quite as sure of her fidelity to another as Harry had been sure of it to himself. Tretton might prevail. Trettons do so often prevail. And the girl's mother was all on his side. So he had gone to Cheltenham, true as the needle to the pole, to try his luck yet once again. He had gone to Cheltenham, and there he found Harry Annesley.

He too would forgive Harry--had forgiven him--was quite ready to omit all further remark on the matter--but could not bring himself; when urged by Florence, to admit that her Apollo had been altogether godlike.

And credit bubbles have always imploded. The amount of dollars out there that are greenbacks - actual cash - is [...] compared to the dollar value of credit instruments. So in my view the Fed is utterly powerless to prevent the ultimate deflation of the credit bubble. And some people say, “Well, they can print money.” Fine, that would just make the credit bubble collapse faster as soon as bond holders realize that’s what they were doing. There’s no way out of it. So that’s the argument....BOB: Well, the hyperinflation part is a pure guess based on politics. It has nothing to do with reading markets. I think the markets are telegraphing deflation, and I’m <b>very</b> <b>confident</b> about <b>that.</b> Hyperinflation to me is going to be the natural political response. I mean these people in Congress are so irresponsible - except to themselves and their families, of course. They always get reelected so they’re doing that correctly. I mean, it’s working for them as individuals but it’s not working for the country.
