40|$|The {{non-destructive}} {{determination of}} Young's modulus of dental composites {{by means of}} the fundamental period was found to be reliable and accurate. Post-polymerization effects could clearly be detected. Exponential regression analysis showed a correlation coefficient of 0. 92, after logarithmic transformation, with <b>volumetric</b> <b>filler</b> content. The high accuracy and reliability of the measurements themselves are reflected in low standard deviations. The results are in excellent agreement with those of other investigations. Furthermore, the ease and speed of operation make this new procedure a powerful laboratory tool for material-testing and practical large-scale investigations. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Several {{mechanical}} properties of experimental composites and an unfilled resin were studied. The dynamic Young's modulus {{was measured with}} a non-destructive dynamic method. The Young's modulus and also the transverse strength were determined statically by means of three-point bending. The hardness was studied by means of Wallace indentation depth measurements, and in vitro wear resistance was assessed under stress-bearing conditions. An exponential regression of the results measured for each property {{as a function of}} the <b>volumetric</b> <b>filler</b> fraction was appraised. An excellent correlation was found with each property. This exponential mixture rule is proposed for the study of the {{mechanical properties}} of isotropic dental composites. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Novel {{polyurethane}} based two-component self-leveling sealant formulations, incorporating {{various types}} of kraft processed lignins including softwood, hardwood, and eucalyptus wood lignin, were produced and their performance properties established in a research program which sought to develop more durable cost effective sealants as well as cultivate a market for lignin, a highly underutilized by-product of the pulp and paper industry. The tensile and compressive performance characteristics of lignin and kaolin filled sealant formulations, compounded at different <b>volumetric</b> <b>filler</b> loadings, were compared and {{the results indicated that}} both types of filler increase the modulus of the base elastomer in relation to the semi-empirical relation of Nielsen. This suggests that the mechanical properties are dependent on the maximum packing fraction of the respective fillers which in turn, is a function of their particle size and size distribution. The relationship between the modulus and the <b>volumetric</b> <b>filler</b> loading was useful in the preparation of sealant formulations having optimum filler contents. Finally, these optimum formulations were prepared for a subsequent testing program in which the tensile strength and cyclic performance of the sealants was compared to that of existing two-component self-leveling sealant compounds currently available on the market. Results of these performance tests indicate that lignin filled elastomeric sealants, in most instances, have adequate tensile strength and perform adequately if subjected to a moderate cyclic strain program. Further improvements in performance properties may be obtained if adjustments to the particle size are made and this is warranted considering six to ten times cost advantage these fillers possess in relation to conventional fillers...|$|E
40|$|Aging is {{a complex}} process caused by many factors. The most {{important}} factors include exposure to UV radiation, smoking, facial muscle movement, gravity, loss and displacement of fat and bone resorption. As a symptom of aging, face loses elasticity, volume and cheerful look. While changing face proportions, the dominant part of a face is its bottom instead of the mid part. The use of three-dimensional face modelling techniques, particularly the mid-face – tear through and cheeks, restores the skin firmness, volume and healthy look. For this purpose the hyaluronic acid is used, calcium hydroxyapatite, and L-polylactic acid <b>fillers.</b> <b>Volumetric</b> techniques require precision and proper selection of the filling agent to {{give a sense of}} satisfaction to both the patient and the doctor. Key words: hyaluronic acid, calcium hydroxyapatite, L-polylactic acid. The ageing of the skin The ageing process is multifactorial and complex. One of the most important factors is skin damage caused by prolonged exposure to UV radiation. The ageing process comprises a loss of fullness of the face characteristic of young people. It results from the loss of subcutaneous tissue, which leads to flattening of the facial structures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>volumetric</b> rate of <b>filler</b> {{affects the}} type and {{structure}} of chemical products emerging during the hardening process of binders and composites based on barium hydrosilicates. It is shown that by means of using the inert filler {{it is possible to}} change the composition of the hardened material. In particular, instead of BaO· 2 SiO 2 · 4 Н 2 О formation, the formation of Ba 5 [Si 4 O 12](OH) 2 can occur. This is due to steric effects and extra amount of the barium cations near the particles of fine filler. It is revealed also that the increase of the filling rate leads to the formation of crystal form of barium hydrosilicates. Such hydrosilicates are characterized by increased interfacial distance. These phenomena prove the presence of the steric effects. However, the chemical reaction of binder (water glass) with hardener (barium chloride) proceeds completely to the end. Thus, neither barium chloride nor sodium hydrosilicates are present in hardened composite. Because of this, disperse filled binders based on barium hydrosilicates (products of reaction between water glass and barium chloride) can be considered as a promising component for effective composites intended for protection from gamma-and neutron radiation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the flexural fatigue behavior of 11 packable composites. Of each material 30 rectangular samples (1. 2 x 5 x 35 mm) for flexural fatigue test were prepared. The clamped fracture strength and flexural fatigue limit (FFL) of each material were determined using a custom-made fatigue machine, after storage of the samples for one month in water at 37 degrees C. All data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni/Dunn's test for multiple comparisons (p< 0. 05). Regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between elastic modulus (Abe et al., 2001), clamped fracture strength or FFL and inorganic filler fraction (vol%). The fracture strengths of all but two materials were in between those of the compact-filled densified composites and the microfine ones. The FFL of the packable composites tested were significantly lower than those of the compact-filled densified composites. Three of the tested materials showed even significantly lower FFL than did the microfine composites. There were statistically significant relationships between both the elastic modulus and the <b>volumetric</b> <b>filler</b> fraction (R(2) = 0. 974, p= 1. 990 x 10 (- 7)). The great diversity in packable composites makes clinical assessment necessary with regard to a justified use in posterior teeth. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|In {{the groups}} treated with high amounts of γ-MPS (7 and 10  %), {{although}} this had no {{significant effect on}} the flexural strength, a decrease in Young’s modulus (E) was observed when compared with the groups treated with 1, 3  % and control group. The Young’s modulus is a mechanical property that describes the relative rigidity of the materials. The decreases in E observed suggest the loss of the ECR ability to relieve the excess of energy during elastic deformation. The Young’s modulus is particularly important as regards composite resins indicated for use in posterior restorations, since composite resins can undergo excessive deformation and are more prone to catastrophic failures [18]. On the other hand in post-restored teeth, Young’s modulus is not an important factor related to failure of the material [19] or endodontically treated teeth restored with composite resin core [20]. Moreover, Young’s modulus represents overall features, not only those of silanization but also as regards the range of particle size, <b>volumetric</b> <b>filler</b> fraction and effectiveness of dispersion, as well as the technological processes used by manufacturers. Indeed these parameters are related to long lasting clinical evaluations of composite resins [21]. Moreover, the use of high silane concentration can be used as an approach to decrease viscosity in composite resins [15] formulations intending to improve handling in clinical use, however this approach should be considered carefully since it can impairs selected properties.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to improve the {{accuracy}} of the predicted shrinkage stress in dental restorations by exploring the interrelationships between the shrinkage stress, the material parameters, the polymerisation shrinkage and the filler content of the composite, through a series of numerical simulation and experimental measurements. Firstly, as a preliminary study, the mathematical solution of a 2 D axisymmetric model of a Class-I dental restoration during resin polymerization was used, to evaluate the effect of each of the above factors on shrinkage stress. The subsequent sensitivity analysis based on the analytical solution showed that shrinkage is the most important factor in the development of shrinkage stresses, followed by Young's modulus and viscosity. Secondly, experiments were conducted on an experimental composite to express its micro hardness, Young's modulus and viscosity as functions of the volumetric shrinkage. Shrinkage was measured with the digital image correlation method. Thirdly, the effects of the <b>volumetric</b> <b>filler</b> fraction and filler morphology on the material properties of dental composites were considered using finite element micro-structural models. Fourthly, the shrinkage stress produced by the experimental composite in the Bioman shrinkage-stress instrument was simulated using the finite element method. Good agreement between the simulation and experiment indicated that the material properties determined using the above methodology are likely to be representative. Finally, 3 D finite element models were employed to calculate the shrinkage stresses in a restored premolar, considering different filler contents in the composite, different filling methods and different cavity shapes. Results showed that the filler content is not the most crucial factor in the development of shrinkage stress in dental restorations, and the incremental filling method can significantly reduce the overall shrinkage stress in dental restoration.

40|$|Master thesis - Norwegian {{university}} {{of science and}} Technology. Department of civil and transport engineering. This master thesis purports to address the effects of different filler types in asphalt mastics and relate the differences to asphalt mixture properties and volumetric composition. Due to variations in properties for different filler types, e. g. particle size, density, mineral composition, Rigden voids, specific surface area and binder interaction, the same filler amount by weight yields variations in occupied volume and bind different amounts of bitumen. Uncontrolled variations of the filler fraction can cause binder drainage {{as a result of}} insufficient reinforcement or a dry mixture with unsatisfactory coating of the aggregates. The literature review focused on outlining characteristics and effects of different fillers and mastic composition and to relate variations in mixture performance to filler types and the ratio of filler to binder. An experimental laboratory research has been conducted to evaluate the effects of using different filler types. Mixtures with limestone and hydrated lime have been compared to mixtures with natural sieved dust from Vassfjell and Steinkjer aggregates on the 0. 063 mm sieve. The results showed that the Rigden void content in the filler has an effect on the compacted asphalt mixture. Higher Rigden void content yields higher indirect tensile strength and a tendency to lower the abrasion resistance. The outcome from cyclic compression test was scattered, and there were too few data point to give any adequate conclusion. The tests showed that the F/A-ratio by mass or volume had less influence on the mixture performance. The air void content and the degree of compaction of the specimen greatly influenced the outcome, which coincide with results in the literature. The air void content was related to the Rigden void content, and in the literature it was found that higher Rigden void content in the filler gave higher air void content in the compacted specimens. Furthermore, increasing Rigden void content tended to increase the effective <b>volumetric</b> <b>filler</b> particle concentration in the mastics...|$|E
