5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as <b>variegation</b> in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E
5|$|McClintock's {{breakthrough}} publications, {{and support}} from her colleagues, led to her being awarded several postdoctoral fellowships from the National Research Council. This funding allowed her to continue to study genetics at Cornell, the University of Missouri, and the California Institute of Technology, where she worked with E. G. Anderson. During the summers of 1931 and 1932, she worked at Missouri with geneticist Lewis Stadler, who introduced her {{to the use of}} X-rays as a mutagen. Exposure to X-rays can increase the rate of mutation above the natural background level, making it a powerful research tool for genetics. Through her work with X-ray-mutagenized maize, she identified ring chromosomes, which form when the ends of a single chromosome fuse together after radiation damage. From this evidence, McClintock hypothesized that there must be a structure on the chromosome tip that would normally ensure stability. She showed that the loss of ring-chromosomes at meiosis caused <b>variegation</b> in maize foliage in generations subsequent to irradiation resulting from chromosomal deletion. During this period, she demonstrated the presence of the nucleolus organizer region on a region on maize chromosome 6, which is required for the assembly of the nucleolus. In 1933, she established that cells can be damaged when nonhomologous recombination occurs. During this same period, McClintock hypothesized that the tips of chromosomes are protected by telomeres.|$|E
25|$|Transitives or causatives are morphologically {{contrastive}} in Hindustani, {{leading to}} the existence of related verb sets divisible along such lines. While the derivation of such forms shows patterns, they do reach a level of <b>variegation</b> so as to make it somewhat difficult to outline all-encompassing rules.

25|$|It {{has been}} shown that the histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT) is {{responsible}} for this methylation activity in the pattern of histones H3 & H4. This enzyme utilizes a catalytically active site called the SET domain (Suppressor of <b>variegation,</b> Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax). The SET domain is a 130-amino acid sequence involved in modulating gene activities. This domain has been demonstrated to bind to the histone tail and causes the methylation of the histone.|$|E
25|$|The {{music of}} Southeastern Moravia differs substantially. Its {{character}} {{is closely related}} to the musical style of Eastern Europe using rather minor keys and melodic elements characteristic of eastern countries such as Ukraine, Slovakia, Romania and Hungary. Here it is also possible to find elements of gypsy scales which contain augmented intervals unusual for the traditional music of Western Europe. One of the most important elements of the traditional music of Southeastern Moravia is emotional <b>variegation</b> and greater rhythmic leeway.|$|E
500|$|The band {{performed}} in the UK in April 1982. NME considered that the show [...] "was all very skillfully deployed: a bruisingly clear sound of scathing force, a clockwork, Pavlovian lightshow, a <b>variegation</b> of light and shade in the song order that builds to the unmitigating force of 'Pornography' itself as the climax". However, the mood on stage was not good: The journalist noted that Smith looked [...] "dejected and tired" [...] for his birthday. Behind the scene, Smith's relationship with Gallup was deteriorating. When the tour reached Europe, tension was so high between the two musicians {{that they had a}} fight after a concert in Strasbourg. Tolhurst found out the next day that his two partners [...] "had both gone back to England". At home, Smith heard his father telling him: [...] "Get right back out on that tour! People have bought tickets!" [...] After two more weeks of touring, the band played their final show in Brussels. Tolhurst later related: [...] "I remember sitting in the dressing room thinking, 'oh well, that's the end of the band, then' [...] I went off to France for a bit. I guess I ran away. Escaping from the reality of The Cure". Back in England, Smith took a rest with a month's camping holiday to the Lake District to [...] "clean up".|$|E

This mutated tissue is unable to survive on its own but is kept alive by its partnership with normal photosynthetic tissue. Sometimes chimeras are also found with layers differing in respect of both their nuclear and their plastid genes.|$|E
2500|$|Moravia, today {{a part of}} the Czech Republic, {{was settled}} by Slavic tribes in the 6th century. Today, however, little is known about this period. Following the decline of Great Moravia in the 9th and 10th centuries, Moravia was {{captured}} by the Přemyslid dynasty and became {{a part of the}} Bohemian Kingdom. During the medieval war-invasions, exotic armies of Turks and Tatars came to the region. Echoes of these dramatic events {{can be found in the}} lyrics of Moravian folk songs. Distinct styles of folk music began to emerge during the Wallachian colonization of the 16th and 17th centuries, separating Bohemian and Moravian traditional music. The [...] "new Hungarian" [...] style has influenced the music of the area in the past three centuries, especially in Southern Moravia. This influence has left a deep imprint on the unusual melodic <b>variegation</b> of Moravian traditional music providing an inspirational source for subsequent Classical, Jazz and Pop music composers.|$|E
2500|$|There are, however, {{important}} {{cases where}} Webern {{may have even}} more profoundly influenced Schoenberg. Haimo marks the swift, radical influence in 1909 of Webern's novel and arresting Five Pieces for String Quartet, op. 5, on Schoenberg's subsequent piano piece op. 11 no. 3; Five Pieces for Orchestra, op. 16; and monodrama Erwartung, op. 17. This shift is distinctly pronounced in a letter Schoenberg wrote to Busoni, which describes a rather Webernian aesthetic: [...] "Harmony is expression and nothing else. [...] Away with Pathos! Away with protracted ten-ton scores [...] My music must be brief. Concise! In two notes: not built, but [...] "expressed"!! And the results I wish for: no stylized and sterile protracted emotion. People are not like that: {{it is impossible for}} a person to have only one sensation at a time. One has thousands simultaneously. [...] And this <b>variegation,</b> this multifariousness, this illogicality which our senses demonstrate, the illogicality presented by their interactions, set forth by some mounting rush of blood, by some reaction of the senses or the nerves, this I should like to have in my music." [...] In 1949 Schoenberg still remembered being [...] "intoxicated by the enthusiasm of having freed music from the shackles of tonality" [...] and believing with his pupils [...] "that now music could renounce motivic features and remain coherent and comprehensible nonetheless".|$|E

60|$|Many authors {{consider}} <b>variegation</b> as {{the result}} of disease; and the foregoing cases may be looked at as the direct result of the inoculation of a disease or some weakness. This has been almost proved to be the case by Morren in the excellent paper just referred to, who shows that even a leaf inserted by its footstalk into the bark of the stock is sufficient to communicate <b>variegation</b> to it, though the leaf soon perishes. Even fully formed leaves on the stock of Abutilon are sometimes affected by the graft and become variegated. <b>Variegation</b> is much influenced, as we shall hereafter see, {{by the nature of the}} soil in which the plants are grown; and it does not seem improbable that whatever change in the sap or tissues certain soils induce, whether or not called a disease, might spread from the inserted piece of bark to the stock.

6000|$|... § 50. In all this, I {{wish the}} reader to observe two things: first, the general carefulness of the poet in {{defining}} color, distinguishing it precisely as a painter would (opposed to the Greek carelessness about it); and, secondly, his regarding the grass for its greenness and <b>variegation,</b> rather than, as a Greek would have done, for its depth and freshness. This greenness or brightness, and <b>variegation,</b> are taken up by later and modern poets, as the things intended to be chiefly expressed by the word [...] "enamelled;" [...] and, gradually, the term is taken to indicate any kind of bright and interchangeable coloring; there being always this much of propriety about it, when used of greensward, that such sward is indeed, like enamel, a coat of bright color on a comparatively dark ground; and is thus a sort of natural jewelry and painter's work, different from loose and large vegetation. The word is often awkwardly and falsely used, by the later poets, {{of all kinds of}} growth and color; as by Milton of the flowers of Paradise showing themselves over its wall; but it retains, nevertheless, through all its jaded inanity, some half-unconscious vestige of the old sense, even to the present day.|$|E
6000|$|... § 49. Now, {{almost in}} {{the opening of the}} Purgatory, as there at the {{entrance}} of the Inferno, we find a company of great ones resting in a grassy place. But the idea of the grass now is very different. The word now used is not [...] "enamel," [...] but [...] "herb," [...] and instead of being merely green, it is covered with flowers of many colors. With the usual mediæval accuracy, Dante insists on telling us precisely what these colors were, and how bright; which he does by naming the actual pigments used in illumination,--"Gold, and fine silver, and cochineal, and white lead, and Indian wood, serene and lucid, and fresh emerald, just broken, would have been excelled, as less is by greater, by the flowers and grass of the place." [...] It is evident that the [...] "emerald" [...] here means the emerald green of the illuminators; for a fresh emerald is no brighter than one which is not fresh, and Dante was not one to throw away his words thus. Observe, then, we have here the idea of the growth, life, and <b>variegation</b> of the [...] "green herb," [...] as opposed to the smalto of the Inferno; but the colors of the <b>variegation</b> are illustrated and defined by the reference to actual pigments; and, observe, because the other colors are rather bright, the blue ground (Indian wood, indigo?) is sober; lucid, but serene; and presently two angels enter, who are dressed in green drapery, but of a paler green than the grass, which Dante marks, by telling us that it was [...] "the green of leaves just budded." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{successful}} Deep Space 1 flyby of Comet P/ 19 Borrelly {{offers an}} unprecedented opportunity to perform disk-resolved photometry and photometric modeling of a comet's nucleus. The flyby {{occurred at a}} favorable ground-based apparition, enabling concomitant telescopic observations that provided both the "big picture" {{in time and space}} and observations at photometric viewing geometries not attained by the spacecraft. The solar phase angle of the encounter period changed from 87 to 52 degrees over a period of 1. 5 hours; this range is ideal for determining the macroscopic roughness of the comet's surface. The microphysical texture of the surface is best determined by ground based observations at aphelion and near opposition. The combination of both disk resolved measurements from DS 1 and disk integrated measurements from both DS 1 and the ground permits a constrained set of photometric parameters to be derived. Preliminary analysis of the global geometric albedo yields a value at V wavelengths (550 nm) between 0. 031 +/- 0. 005 (for a Mathilde-type solar phase curve at phase angles less than 10 degrees) and 0. 042 +/- 0. 005 (for an average C-type phase curve). Albedo <b>variegations</b> of at least a factor of two exist on Borrelly's surface: Its light curve amplitude of nearly a magnitude may thus not be due to shape alone.

6000|$|... § 35. It is interesting, by the way, {{with respect}} to this love of stones in the Italian mind, to {{consider}} the difference necessitated in the English temper merely by the general domestic use of wood instead of marble. In that old Shakesperian England, men must have rendered a grateful homage to their oak forests, in the sense of all that they owed to their goodly timbers in the wainscot and furniture of the rooms they loved best, when the blue of the frosty midnight was contrasted, in the dark diamonds of the lattice, with the glowing brown of the warm, fire-lighted, crimson-tapestried walls. Not less would an Italian look with a grateful regard on the hill summits, to which he owed, in the scorching of his summer noonday, escape into the marble corridor or crypt palpitating only with cold and smooth <b>variegation</b> of the unfevered mountain veins.

The soil of another district in Surrey has a strong tendency to cause <b>variegation,</b> as appears from information given me by Sir F. Pollock. Verlot (23/10. 'Des Varietes' etc. page 76.) states that the variegated strawberry retains its character as long as grown in a dryish soil, but soon loses it when planted in fresh and humid soil. Mr. Salter, who is well known for his success in cultivating variegated plants, informs me that rows of strawberries were planted in his garden in 1859, in the usual way; and at various distances in one row, several plants simultaneously became variegated; and what made the case more extraordinary, all were variegated in precisely the same manner. These plants were removed, but during the three succeeding years other plants in the same row became variegated, and in no instance were the plants in any adjoining row affected.|$|E
