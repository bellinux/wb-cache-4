40|$|Development of TarVIP 1. 0, a {{computer}} model for predicting the detection distances of normal and UV activated pavement markings was recently completed at the Operator Performance Laboratory (OPL). Two Sherwin-Williams UV activated pavement marking samples, four UV headlamp units (Ultralux, Visteon, Cibio and Labino brands), and the UV filter covering the Labino UV headlamp unit were characterized {{in terms of their}} fluorescence coefficients, spectral emissions, and spectral transmissivity, respectively. The TarVIP model properly accounts for a complete three-dimensional representation of the roadway-headlamp-driver geometry. Veiling luminance due to fog is modeled using the Mie Scattering theory. The model consists of physical and human performance subsystems. Besides the aforementioned physical subsystem items, the human performance subsystem uses an extensive human visibility contrast threshold database to represent the human capabilities and limitations of pavement marking detection. The model was used to obtain the <b>visibility</b> <b>distances</b> under various levels of fog density, UV activated pavement marking and UV headlamp efficiencies.

30|$|In Sweden, about 25 % of all bicycle {{accidents}} involving {{a motor vehicle}} occur at cycle crossings [1]. Swedish traffic rules state that bicyclists should yield to motorists at cycle crossings, except at roundabout exits and immediately after the motorist has turned in a crossing. In the two latter cases the driver has probably raised her/his level of attentiveness because of the roundabout/crossing and also reduced the speed. In a recent proposal from the Swedish Transport Agency [2], {{it is suggested that}} motorists should yield to bicyclists at all cycle crossings. It is thus of importance that the cycle crossings are designed {{in a way that the}} motorists will detect them on a distance where they will have time to scan the surroundings and stop if a bicyclist appears.

If the procedure calls for {{at least half a}} statute mile flight visibility (roughly 2600 feet), spotting the Decision Bar at the marker would indicate enough flight visibility to continue the procedure. In addition, the shorter bars before and after the Decision Bar are spaced either 100 feet or 200 feet apart, depending on the ALS type. The number of short bars the pilot can see can be used to determine flight visibility. Approaches with lower minimums use the more precise 100-foot spacing systems for more accurate identification of visibility.|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric <b>visibility</b> <b>distance</b> is a {{property}} of the atmosphere, which can be remotely sensed by computer vision. In this aim, a non-linear mapping function between the atmospheric <b>visibility</b> <b>distance</b> and the contrast in images must be estimated.

In order to calibrate and deploy such camera-based atmospheric visibility estimations, we present two methods which aim at computing the scene depth distribution and the radiometry of the scene beforehand. The scene depth is recovered by registering a full 3 D model of the environment in the frame of the camera. The radiometry of the scene is partly recovered by looking at the temporal correlation between the variation of pixels intensity and the variation of the sky luminance estimated by a luminance meter oriented toward the North direction. Based on clear-sky models, it is demonstrated that such a process detects a set of pixels, which include pixels belonging to North-oriented Lambertian surfaces.

Roadway ITS is introduced for its beneficial effects on throughput, safety and emissions. However, negative effects are often neglected.

For example: Even though dynamic speed limits are designed to provide throughput benefits during periods of high flow, the presence of the signs and speed enforcement cameras reduce the average speeds also beyond peak hours, increasing general travel times, so even if speed limits are not displayed. Also, dynamic adaptation of speed limits has unexpectedly shown to decrease capacity on some sections and to increase the percentage of rat running traffic to avoid the road section.
