40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of two vaginal progesterone formulations, Crinone gel and Utrogestan capsules, for luteal phase support in blastocyst stage embryo transfers. Materials and MethodsWe analyzed 460 consecutive cycles in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) –blastocyst transfer (BT) treatment at our institution between January 2004 and December 2007. Patients applied either Crinone 8 % vaginal gel (90 mg, once daily) or Utrogestan <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules</b> (200 mg, four times daily) for luteal supplementation. Progesterone was administered from the day of oocyte retrieval to pregnancy confirmation. Clinical pregnancy and implantation rates were the main outcome measures. ResultsThe clinical pregnancy rate (58. 7 % vs. 44. 3 %) and implantation rate (32. 04 % vs. 23. 89 %) were significantly higher in the Crinone group compared with the Utrogestan group after IVF/ICSI–BT treatment.

40|$|Background: Medical {{misuse of}} {{antibiotics}} {{is associated with}} the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance, resulting in a lack of effective drugs and increased health-care cost. Nevertheless, inappropriate antibiotic use in China remains common and the situation requires urgent improvement. Here, we analyzed the prescriptions of antibiotics and evaluated the rationality of antibiotic use among outpatients in Beijing general hospitals during 2015. Methods: We collected basic medical insurance claim data from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 in 507 general hospitals of Beijing. A descriptive analysis of outpatient antibiotic prescribing was performed. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification/defined daily doses system was used to evaluate the rationality of antibiotic use. Results: Over the study, an estimated 721, 930, 613, 520, and 822, 480 antibiotics were dispensed in primary, secondary, and tertiary general hospitals corresponding to 5. 09 %, 5. 06 %, and 2. 53 % of all prescriptions, respectively. Antibiotic combinations represented 2. 95 %, 7. 74 %, and 10. 18 % of the total antibiotic prescriptions, respectively. Expenditure for the top twenty antibiotics in primary, secondary, and tertiary general hospitals was RMB 42. 92, 65. 89, and 83. 26 million Yuan, respectively. Cephalosporins were the most frequently prescribed class of antibiotic in clinical practice. The antibiotics used inappropriately included azithromycin enteric-coated capsules, compound cefaclor tablets and nifuratel nysfungin <b>vaginal</b> <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> in primary hospitals, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium dispersible tablets (7 : 1) and cefonicid sodium for injection in secondary hospitals, cefminox sodium for injection and amoxicillin sodium and sulbactam sodium for injection in tertiary hospitals. Conclusions: Antibiotic use in Beijing general hospitals is generally low; however, inappropriate antibiotic use still exists. Inappropriately used antibiotics should be subject to rigorous control and management, and public policy initiatives are required to promote the judicious use of antibiotics...|$|R

We tried to study whether the rectal route {{could be an}} effective alternative and associated with less discomfort. Patients and Methods A prospective randomized controlled study. All patient were eligible for IVF treatment for infertility. After oocyte pickup, 186 patients were allocated to one the following protocols for luteal phase support: (i) rectal pessaries group: natural progesterone pessaries administered rectally 200 mg three times a day, (ii) vaginal pessaries group: natural progesterone pessaries administered vaginally 200 mg three times a day), and (iii) <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules</b> group: natural micronized progesterone capsules administered vaginally 200 mg three times a day. On the day of pregnancy test, patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire conducted by an investigator {{in order to assess}} the tolerability and side effects of the LPS treatment taken. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of perineal irritation. Results Fifty eight patients were assigned to the rectal pessaries group, 68 patients to the vaginal pessaries group, and 60 patients to the <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules</b> group. All patients adhered to their allocated treatment. Implantation and clinical pregnancy rates per transfer did not differ between the three groups. Perineal irritation, which was our primary endpoint, was the same for all the three groups (respectively 1. 7 % versus 5. 9 % versus 11. 7 %). Regarding the other side effects, more patients experienced constipation and flatulence with the rectal route, whereas more patients reported vaginal discharge in the <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules</b> group.

Guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and a Cochrane review called for a definitive trial to test whether or not progesterone therapy in the first trimester could {{reduce the risk of}} miscarriage in women with a history of unexplained recurrent miscarriage (RM). The PROMISE trial was conducted to answer this question. A concurrent cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted. DESIGN AND SETTING A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international multicentre study, with economic evaluation, conducted in hospital settings across the UK (36 sites) and in the Netherlands (nine sites). PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS Women with unexplained RM (three or more first-trimester losses), aged between 18 and 39 years at randomisation, conceiving naturally and giving informed consent, received either micronised progesterone (Utrogestan(®), Besins Healthcare) at a dose of 400 [*]mg (two <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules</b> of 200 [*]mg) or placebo <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules</b> twice daily, administered vaginally from soon after a positive urinary pregnancy test (and no later than 6 weeks of gestation) until 12 completed weeks of gestation (or earlier if the pregnancy ended before 12 weeks). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Live birth beyond 24 completed weeks of gestation (primary outcome), clinical pregnancy at 6 - 8 weeks, ongoing pregnancy at 12 weeks, miscarriage, gestation at delivery, neonatal survival at 28 days of life, congenital abnormalities and resource use.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the motion of <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> in microchannels is useful for a number applications. This knowledge {{can be used to}} develop devices to sort biological cells based on their size and stiffness. For example, cancer cells have a different stiffness from healthy cells and thus can be readily identified. Additionally, devices can be developed to detect flaws in synthetic particles. Using a 3 D hybrid lattice Boltzmann and lattice spring method, the motion of rigid and <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> in a pressure-driven microfluidic flow was probed. The effect of inertial drift is evaluated in channels different Reynolds numbers. Other system parameters such as capsule elasticity and channel size are also varied to determine their effect. The equilibrium position of capsules in the channel is also obtained. The equilibrium position of rigid and <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> depends on the relative particle size. If the capsule is small, the equilibrium position is found to be closer to the channel wall. Conversely, for larger capsules, the equilibrium position is closer to the channel centerline.

Methods: Artificial stomach fluid (ASF) and artificial intestinal fluid (AIF) were prepared. Stability of three types of Xuesaitong capsules was examined for 4  h in stomachs and 24  h in intestines. Samples were analyzed at different times by high-performance liquid chromatography. Percent content of NGR 1, GRg 1, GRb 1, GRe, and GRd at different times was calculated. Results: Hard capsules incubated in ASF disintegrated within 2 – 3  min, whereas <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> disintegrated within 7 – 8  min. Components in hard capsules were dissolved rapidly in water, with content of each compound reaching 90 % in 5  min, and degradation of each compound reaching 30 – 50 % after incubation for 240  min. Dissolution and degradation of each component in <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> with a water-soluble base tended to balance at 30 – 90  min. Contents in <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> with a lipid-soluble base showed slow dissolution after ASF incubation for 120  min. Five saponins in identical types of capsules incubated in ASF had similar stability curves.

40|$|Background: Darunavir, a second-generation {{protease}} inihibitor, is {{used with}} a low boosting dose of ritonavir to improve its clinical efficacy. The boosting dose of ritonavir acts as an inhibitor of CYP 3 A 4, thereby increasing darunavir bioavailability. Recently, ritonavir tablet has been on sale in place of <b>soft</b> <b>capsule.</b> However, pharmacokinetic study of darunavir by changing ritonavir form is still not clear. In this study, we aimed to compare with plasma darunavir concentrations by switching ritinavir <b>soft</b> <b>capsule</b> to tablet in Japanese HIV- 1 infected patients. Methods: We analyzed 34 Japanese HIV- 1 infected patients (32 males: 2 females) recruited at the National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center. All patients had been administered with 800 / 100 mg darunavir/ritonavir once daily {{in combination with other}} antiretrovirals. Plasma darunavir concentrations were determined by an HPLC method. A pared t-test was used to compare with their concentrations by switching from ritonavir <b>soft</b> <b>capsule</b> to tablet. Results: The mean of age, body weight, and duration of antiretroviral therapy for 34 patients were 41. 9 (range: 24 &#x 2013; 62) years, 66. 3 (range: 51. 4 &#x 2013; 90. 0) kg, and 436 (range: 182 &#x 2013; 739) days, respectively. The mean&#x 00 B 1;SD darunavir concentration was 3. 44 &#x 00 B 1; 1. 78 &#x 00 B 5;g/ml when ritonavir <b>soft</b> <b>capsule</b> was co-administered. After switching to ritonavir tablet, the mean&#x 00 B 1;SD darunavir concentration was 3. 30 &#x 00 B 1; 2. 02 &#x 00 B 5;g/ml.

In this study, we assessed whether DNA fingerprinting by repetitive element sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) can be used to distinguish the capsule strain of L. crispatus (CTV- 05) from other endogenous strains as well as other species of vaginal lactobacilli. Vaginal and rectal lactobacilli were identified to the species level by using whole-chromosome probe DNA hybridization. The DNAs from L. crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, and an as-yet-unnamed H 2 O 2 -negative Lactobacillus species designated 1086 V were subjected to rep-PCR. The results of gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining of the DNA fingerprints obtained were compared. L. crispatus CTV- 05 had a unique DNA fingerprint compared to all other lactobacilli.

Methods Women (n = 100) with bacterial vaginosis diagnosed by Amsel criteria were after informed consent offered vaginal clindamycin therapy followed by <b>vaginal</b> gelatine <b>capsules</b> containing either 10 9 freeze-dried lactobacilli or identical placebo capsules for 10 days during 3 menstrual cycles in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Results The initial intent to treat (ITT) analysis for the one-month cure rate was 64 % in the lactobacilli group and 78 % in the placebo group (p > 0. 05). However, any patient with missing or unclassified smears at the initial visit who continued the study and whose next smear indicated a cure was included in the cured group; the study also excluded two of the patients in the lactobacilli group who reported that they did not take any <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules.</b> With consideration to these population changes, the initial cure rate would be 77 % in the lactobacilli group. The 76 cured women were followed for 6 menstrual cycles or until relapse within that time span. At the end of the study, 64. 9 % (24 / 37) of the lactobacilli treated women were still BV-free compared to 46. 2 % (18 / 39) of the placebo treated women. Comparison of the two groups regarding "Time from cure to relapse" was statistically significant (p = 0. 027) in favour of the lactobacilli treatment. Adjuvant therapy with lactobacilli contributed significantly to avoidance of relapse with a proportional Hazard Risk ratio (HR) of 0. 73 (0. 54 – 0. 98) (p Conclusion The study shows that supplementary treatment combining two different strains of probiotic lactobacilli does not improve the efficacy of BV therapy during the first month of treatment, but for women initially cured, adjunct treatment of lactobacilli during 3 menstrual cycles lengthens the time to relapse significantly in that more women remained BV free at the end of the 6 -month follow up.

40|$|Progesterone is {{essential}} to maintain a healthy pregnancy. Guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and a Cochrane review called for a definitive trial to test whether or not progesterone therapy in the first trimester could {{reduce the risk of}} miscarriage in women with a history of unexplained recurrent miscarriage (RM). The PROMISE trial was conducted to answer this question. A concurrent cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international multicentre study, with economic evaluation, conducted in hospital settings across the UK (36 sites) and in the Netherlands (nine sites). Women with unexplained RM (three or more first-trimester losses), aged between 18 and 39 years at randomisation, conceiving naturally and giving informed consent, received either micronised progesterone (Utrogestan(®), Besins Healthcare) at a dose of 400 [*]mg (two <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules</b> of 200 [*]mg) or placebo <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules</b> twice daily, administered vaginally from soon after a positive urinary pregnancy test (and no later than 6 weeks of gestation) until 12 completed weeks of gestation (or earlier if the pregnancy ended before 12 weeks). Live birth beyond 24 completed weeks of gestation (primary outcome), clinical pregnancy at 6 - 8 weeks, ongoing pregnancy at 12 weeks, miscarriage, gestation at delivery, neonatal survival at 28 days of life, congenital abnormalities and resource use. Participants were randomised after confirmation of pregnancy. Randomisation was performed online via a secure internet facility. Data were collected on four occasions of outcome assessment after randomisation, up to 28 days after birth. A total of 1568 participants were screened for eligibility. Of the 836 women randomised between 2010 and 2013, 404 received progesterone and 432 received placebo. The baseline data (age, body mass index, maternal ethnicity, smoking status and parity) of the participants were comparable in the two arms of the trial. The follow-up rate to primary outcome was 826 out of 836 (98. 8 %). The live birth rate in the progesterone group was 65. 8 % (262 / 398) and in the placebo group it was 63. 3 % (271 / 428), giving a relative risk of 1. 04 (95 % confidence interval 0. 94 to 1. 15; p[*]=[*] 0. 45). There was no evidence of {{a significant difference between the}} groups for any of the secondary outcomes. Economic analysis suggested a favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for decision-making but wide confidence intervals indicated a high level of uncertainty in the health benefits. Additional sensitivity analysis suggested the probability that progesterone would fall within the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's threshold of £ 20, 000 - 30, 000 per quality-adjusted life-year as between 0. 7145 and 0. 7341. There is no evidence that first-trimester progesterone therapy improves outcomes in women with a history of unexplained RM. This study did not explore the effect of treatment with other progesterone preparations or treatment during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Future research could explore the efficacy of progesterone supplementation administered during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle in women attempting natural conception despite a history of RM.
