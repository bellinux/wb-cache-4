50|$|The high <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> {{supplies}} the <b>pressure</b> needed to push water through the membrane, {{even as the}} membrane rejects the passage of salt through it. Typical pressures for brackish water range from 225 to 376 psi (15.5 to 26 bar, or 1.6 to 2.6 MPa). In the case of seawater, they range from 800 to 1,180 psi (55 to 81.5 bar or 6 to 8 MPa).

40|$|The {{supply of}} clean {{drinking}} water {{is of great}} concern in many remote coastal areas. One method of providing this clean water {{is the process of}} desalination of seawater. This process generally requires either high temperatures (evaporation processes) or very high pressures (6 MPa for reverse osmosis processes). Current research at the University of Southampton focuses on the development of a wave powered standalone system for desalination and/or electricity production. A high <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> has been developed for pressurization of seawater for direct use in a reverse osmosis desalination process. The high <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> is driven by a supply of water, of 2 meter head, delivered by a simple wave energy converter. The proposed system has the benefit of simple technology and possesses significant potential for use in developing countries. This paper focuses on the device which will deliver water to the high <b>pressure</b> <b>pump.</b> The delivery device constitutes a wave energy converter and uses the principles common to most Oscillating Water Column (OWC) systems to pump water...|$|R
5000|$|Improved pump {{efficiency}} to maintain oil {{supply to the}} engine. Since scavenge pumps are typically mounted at the lowest point on the engine, the oil flows into the pump intake by gravity {{rather than having to}} be lifted up into the intake of the pump as in a wet-sump. Furthermore, scavenge pumps can be of a design that is more tolerant of entrapped gasses than the typical <b>pressure</b> <b>pump,</b> which can lose suction if too much air mixes into the oil. Since the <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> is typically lower than the external oil tank, it always has a positive pressure on its suction regardless of cornering forces.|$|R

40|$|A {{qualitative}} {{assessment of}} the tendency for pogo instability of the shuttle vehicle {{in the absence of}} suppression devices, and the effectiveness of two passive suppressors (the compliant accumulator and the resistive accumulator) in counteracting any tendency toward instability is provided. In addition, the relative effectiveness of three suppressor locations (the low <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> (LWOP) inlet and discharge and the high <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> (HPOP) inlet) is also evaluated. The primary conclusion of the study is that effective pogo suppression, with passive devices, can be accomplished at the HPOP inlet location but not at the LPOP locations.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} proportional assist ventilation, <b>variable</b> <b>pressure</b> support, and conventional pressure support ventilation on lung function and damage in experimental acute lung injury. DESIGN: : Randomized experimental study. SETTING: University hospital research facility. SUBJECTS: : Twenty-four juvenile pigs. INTERVENTIONS: Pigs were anesthetized, intubated, and mechanically ventilated. Acute lung injury was induced by saline lung lavage. After resuming of spontaneous breathing, animals {{were randomly assigned to}} 6 hrs of assisted ventilation with pressure support ventilation, proportional assist ventilation, or <b>variable</b> <b>pressure</b> support (n = 8 per group). Mean tidal volume was kept at â 6 mL/kg in all modes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Lung functional parameters, distribution of ventilation by electrical impedance tomography, and breathing patterns were analyzed. Histological lung damage and pulmonary inflammatory response were determined postmortem. Variable -pressure support and proportional assist ventilation improved oxygenation and venous admixture compared with pressure support ventilation. Proportional assist ventilation led to higher esophageal pressure time product than <b>variable</b> <b>pressure</b> support and pressure support ventilation, and redistributed ventilation from central to dorsal lung regions compared to <b>pressure</b> support ventilation. <b>Variable</b> <b>pressure</b> support and proportional assist ventilation yielded higher tidal volume variability than pressure support ventilation. Such pattern was deterministic (self-organized) during proportional assist ventilation and stochastic (random) during <b>variable</b> <b>pressure</b> support. Subject-ventilator synchrony as well as pulmonary inflammatory response and damage did not differ among groups. CONCLUSIONS: In a lung lavage model of acute lung injury, both <b>variable</b> <b>pressure</b> support and proportional assist ventilation increased the variability of tidal volume and improved oxygenation and venous admixture, without influencing subject-ventilator synchrony or affecting lung injury compared with pressure support ventilation. However, <b>variable</b> <b>pressure</b> support yielded less inspiratory effort than proportional assist ventilation at comparable mean tidal volumes of 6 mL/kg...|$|R
50|$|Engines {{are both}} {{lubricated}} and cooled by oil that circulates throughout the engine, feeding various bearings and other moving parts and then draining, via gravity, into the sump {{at the base}} of the engine. In the wet-sump system of most production automobile engines, a pump collects this oil from the sump and directly circulates it back through the engine. In a dry-sump, the oil still falls to the base of the engine, however instead of collecting in a reservoir-style oil sump, it falls into a much shallower sump, where one or more scavenge pumps draw it away and transfer it to a (usually external) reservoir, where it is both cooled and de-aerated before being recirculated through the engine by a <b>pressure</b> <b>pump.</b> Dry-sump designs frequently mount the <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> and scavenge pumps on a common crankshaft, so that one pulley at the front of the system can run as many pumps as the engine design requires. It is common practice to have one scavenge pump per crankcase section, however in the case of inverted engines (aircraft engine) it is necessary to employ separate scavenge pumps for each cylinder bank. Therefore, an inverted V engine would have a minimum of two scavenge <b>pumps</b> and a <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> in the pump stack.|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{turbulence}} {{can affect}} soil gas transport, and thus violates {{the assumption that}} molecular diffusion is the only relevant transport mechanism in the soil. Due to the oscillating character of turbulence-induced <b>pressure</b> <b>pumping</b> the net vertical air flow into/out of the soil is zero. Yet, the dispersion processes induced by the oscillating air movement in the soil pores enhance the gas exchange in the soil, and should be considered when the gradient method is applied. We developed a simple lab method to test the impact of turbulence-driven <b>pressure</b> <b>pumping</b> on soil gas transport using neon as a tracer gas. The experiment was conducted using soil core samples from three contrasting forest sites. The ratio of air permeability and air-filled pore-volume, k(a) /epsilon, {{was found to be}} suitable to assess the sensitivity of soil gas transport to the pressure-pumping effect. The pressure-pumping effect reached up to 60 % of the diffusive flux rates depending on the intensity of <b>pressure</b> <b>pumping.</b> We conclude that the turbulence effect can substantially influence soil gas transport in field studies, especially at sites with a high k(a) /epsilon value > 1000 mu m(2). Therefore, we recommend taking this effect into account when soil gas flux is determined using the gradient method...|$|R
