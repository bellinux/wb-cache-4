The author introduces {{a new approach to}} competing risks data, called <b>vertical</b> <b>modeling.</b> It is built on natural observable quantities in competing risks, that is, it quantifies 1. the chance that a failure occurs, irrespective of its cause and 2. conditionally that a failure occurred, it quantifies the risk that the event of failure is ascertained to a certain type of failure. Another appealing feature of <b>vertical</b> <b>modeling</b> which is discussed is that it deals with competing risks when missing causes of failure occur. Next, the author tackles the topic of dynamic prediction in competing risks, a topical subject nowadays. She uses two different approaches, one which is based on modeling the cause-specific hazards and one which is based on modeling the dynamic pseudo-observations associated to the cumulative incidence functions. The results presented {{in this thesis}} provide key messages on the use of competing risks methods in different fields such as epidemiology, medicine, demography. M. A.

40|$|A simple test hail growth {{model is}} created {{in order to}} compare {{hailstone}} sizes from <b>model</b> <b>vertical</b> velocities and calculated updrafts from a simple cloud model using forecasted soundings. The models used MM 5 model data coinciding with severe hail events collected from the Central and Southern Plains from March to May 2006 and 2007. In the test model, four different starting embryo sizes were interjected into four separate hail growth modes: dry growth and wet growth using <b>model</b> <b>vertical</b> velocities and dry and wet growths using calculated updrafts. These embryos were placed at four different beginning vertical levels resulting in 64 possible ending hailstone sizes. Examination of the 804 hail events revealed the potential usefulness of <b>model</b> <b>vertical</b> velocities in generating severe hailstones. In particular, using dry growth, the <b>model</b> <b>vertical</b> velocities produced 727 severe hailstones compare to 661 produced by dry growth using the thermodynamically calculated updraft. <b>Model</b> <b>vertical</b> velocities also proved more accurate than updrafts, resulting in an average error of 0. 417 compare to 0. 788 under dry growth conditions.

40|$|The {{vertical}} wind or downdraft {{component of}} a microburst-generated wind shear can significantly degrade airplane performance. Doppler radar and lidar are two sensor technologies being tested to provide flight crews with early warning {{of the presence of}} hazardous wind shear. An inherent limitation of Doppler-based sensors is the inability to measure velocities perpendicular to the line of sight, which results in an underestimate of the total wind shear hazard. One solution to the line-of-sight limitation is to use a <b>vertical</b> wind <b>model</b> to estimate the vertical component from the horizontal wind measurement. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the ability of simple <b>vertical</b> wind <b>models</b> to improve the hazard prediction capability of an airborne Doppler sensor in a realistic microburst environment. Both simulation and flight test measurements were used to test the <b>vertical</b> wind <b>models.</b> The results indicate that in the altitude region of interest (at or below 300 m), the simple <b>vertical</b> wind <b>models</b> improved the hazard estimate. The radar simulation study showed that the magnitude of the performance improvement was altitude dependent. The altitude of maximum performance improvement occurred at about 300 m...|$|R

The results indicate considerably more support for the <b>vertical</b> <b>model.</b> The correlation between skill differences and FDI is positive in all industries, but when differences are large, FDI flows into sectors that are intensive in total labor, regardless of skill level.

One simple taxonomy separates the theory into "vertical" models, in which firms geographically separate activities by stages of production, and "horizontal" models, in which multi-plant firms duplicate {{roughly the same}} activities in many countries. We refer to a hybrid of these two as the "knowledge-capital model".
