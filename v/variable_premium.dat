We test how fraud behavior varies for insurance contracts with full coverage, a straight deductible or <b>variable</b> <b>premiums</b> (bonus-malus contract). In our experiment, filing fraudulent claims is a dominant strategy for selfish participants, with no psychological costs of committing fraud. While some people always commit fraud, a substantial share of people only occasionally or never defraud. In addition, we find that deductible contracts may be perceived as unfair and thus increase the extent of claim build-up compared to full coverage contracts. In contrast, bonus-malus contracts with <b>variable</b> insurance <b>premiums</b> significantly reduce the filing of fictitious claims compared to both full coverage and deductible contracts. This reduction cannot be explained by monetary incentives. Our results indicate that contract design significantly affects psychological costs and, consequently, the extent of fraudulent behavior of policyholders.

Among the ways to manage risk, the subscriptions of participating and non-participating contracts respectively permit to implement the two major principles in risk allocation: the mutuality and the transfer principles. Decomposing a global risk into its idiosyncratic and systemic components, we show that: the participating contract hedges the individual losses under a <b>variable</b> <b>premium</b> and the systemic risk {{is covered with a}} non-participating contract under a fixed premium. Based on Doherty and Schlesinger (2002) and Mahul (2002) approaches, our model replaces the non-participating contract by a financial one based on an index closely correlated to the systemic risk, under a basis risk. Despite the introduction of loading factors on both participating and financial contracts, which increase final loss, we prove that the combination of policies offers an optimal coverage that eliminates the basis risk and provides a sustainable solution for the insurer and the policyholder. We also put in evidence the necessary intermediation of insurance companies in the subscription of such contracts. Therefore, potential implications for crop risk management are studied.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how public intervention (prudential policy) {{in the banking}} area should be pursued and aims at providing points for discussion in considering what kind of system should be established to promote both the efficiency and stability of banking functions. The basic thrust of the paper {{is that it is}} effective to utilize market mechanisms to improve the efficiency of banking functions and that public intervention is justified in coping with various market failures if optimality is satisfied. Here, market failure is taken to mean (1) information asymmetry between banks and creditors (especially small-lot depositors) and (2) any negative externality that illiquidity and insolvency transmit in a networked way to other banks, leading to the likely emergence of various risks such as (a) small-lot depositors bearing losses, (b) the collapse of solvent banks due to a liquidity shortage, (c) the spreading by contagion of illiquidity of banks, and (d) the spreading by contagion of insolvency of banks. In examining public intervention to cope with these risks, we conclude that a deposit insurance system with a <b>variable</b> <b>premium</b> and prompt closure action are effective in dealing with risk (a), that the invocation of the central bank's lender of last resort function is effective for risks (b) and (c), and that the introduction of a charge system to internalize externality is effective for risk (d). Arguments in this paper are conceptual in that they are derived based on certain assumptions with respect to entities related to the banking system, and thus do not exhaustively cover all the factors necessary for deciding actual policies. We hope that our conceptual summary provides grounds for future discussions on more specific system design. ...|$|E
40|$|Parisian {{excursion}} of a Levy {{process is}} defined as the excursion of the process below or above a pre-defined barrier continuously exceeding a certain time length. In this thesis, we study classical and Parisian type of ruin problems, as well as Parisian excursions of collective risk processes generalized on the classical Cramer-Lundberg risk model. We consider that claim sizes follow mixed exponential distributions and that the main focus is claim arrival process converging to an inverse Gaussian process. By this convergence, there are infinitely many and arbitrarily small claim sizes over any finite time interval. The results are obtained through Gerber-Shiu penalty function employed in an infinitesimal generator and inverting corresponding Laplace transform applied to the generator. In Chapter 3, the classical collective risk process under the Cram´er-Lundberg risk model framework is introduced, and probabilities of ruin with claim sizes following exponential distribution and a combination of exponential distributions are also studied. In Chapter 4, we focus on a surplus process with the total claim process converging to an inverse Gaussian process. The classical probability of ruin and the joint distribution of ruin time, overshoot and initial capital are given. This joint distribution could provide us with probabilities of ruin given different initial capitals in any finite time horizon. In Chapter 5, the classical ruin problem is extended to Parisian type of ruin, which requires that the length of excursions of the surplus process continuously below zero reach a predetermined time length. The joint law of the first excursion above zero and the first excursion under zero is studied. Based on the result, the Laplace transform of Parisian ruin time and formulae of probability of Parisian type of ruin with different initial capitals are obtained. Considering the asymptotic properties of claim arrival process, we also propose an approximation of the probability of Parisian type of ruin when the initial capital converges to infinity. In Chapter 6, we generalize the surplus process to two cases with total claim process still following an inverse Gaussian process. The first generalization is the case of <b>variable</b> <b>premium</b> income, in which the insurance company invests previous surplus and collects interest. The probability of survival and numerical results are given. The second generalization is the case in which capital inflow is also modelled by a stochastic process, i. e. a compound Poisson process.

40|$|Recent {{literature}} offers {{few examples}} of study which draws {{a relationship between the}} level of the insurance premium and accident prevention. Nevertheless, many assume <b>variable</b> <b>premiums</b> exert a positive effect on road safety.

In view of the lack of adequate research results, it is important to find more or new areas of application for financial stimuli, and to test and evaluate their potential. The financial stimuli which may be offered by insurers to their customers can either be direct (for instance by rewarding drivers who have good accident records) or be indirect (for example co-financing of courses). The development of cost awareness could also represent a method by which insurers can promote safety. It is recommended that further research is undertaken to investigate whether drivers of company cars (especially lease cars) are more frequently involved in accidents and/or accidents with a more serious outcome than a comparable group of private motorists.

To avoid expensive premium variability, small firms may attempt to maintain a workforce with low expected health costs. This results in employment distortions. I examine the magnitude of these employment distortions using the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey and the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Based on the underwriting behavior of insurance companies in 1988, I classify medical conditions into three categories: conditions that led to denial of coverage; conditions that led to exclusion restrictions; and, conditions that led to higher premiums. In 1987, I find that insured small firms {{were less likely to}} employ workers with families that had conditions that led to higher premiums than insured large firms. However, in 1996, possibly due to the passage of small group health insurance reforms that restrict insurers' ability to exclude or deny coverage, insured small firms were less likely to employ workers with denial conditions compared to insured large firms. These results suggest that the pattern of employment distortions in insured small firms is consistent with the evolving small group health insurance market.
