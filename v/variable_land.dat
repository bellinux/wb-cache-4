40|$|The Squeeze film damper {{has proved}} a useful means of {{eliminating}} instabilities and reducing vibration in rotor-bearing systems. Analyses for this problem generally assume parallel land dampers. In this thesis, the pressure distribution, the fluid film forces, and the stiffness and damping coefficients of <b>variable</b> <b>land</b> geometry narrow, circular orbit type squeeze film dampers are obtained theoretically, assuming end feed and the Short Bearing Approximation. The coefficients for 7 r film are obtained for quartic, exponential, cosine and step wise axial profile variation and {{compared to those}} for parallel axial land geometry. It is shown that <b>variable</b> <b>land</b> geometry dampers can reduce the variation of stiffness and damping coefficients, thereby reducing the degree of damper force non-linearity, and presumally reducing the likelihood of undesirable bistable operation. Alternatively, variable axial land geometry dampers can significantly alter the unbalance response, and in particular, the likelihood of undesirable jump of circular orbit type squeeze film dampers. This thesis investigates the effect of <b>variable</b> <b>land</b> geometry profiles mentioned above on the jump up propensity of such dampers. Theoretical investigation is restricted to n film vertical rigid rotors with end feed {{and the application of}} Short Bearing Approximation. It is found that regardless of unbalance and regardless of the depth, width or shape of the profile, parallel land dampers are least likely to experience jump up to undesirable operation modes. These conflicting conclusions might be accounted for by the reduction in damping, and in fact, the reduction in the pressure. Moroever, the damper model with end feed assumed in this thesis could alter pressure distributions and forces. Thus, these conclusions will need to be qualified for practical dampers with oil hole feed. Finally, the limitation of Short Bearing Approximation for large e region could alter actual unbalance response data...|$|E
40|$|Different factors {{contribute}} to soil moisture variability at different space scales and timescales, including soil properties, topography, vegetation, land management, and atmospheric forcings, such as precipitation and temperature. Field experiments supported by adaptive geostatistical and exploratory analysis, including categorical elimination of different governing factors, are needed to bring new insight to this important hydrologic problem. During the Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP 97) Hydrology Experiment in Oklahoma, we investigated the within-season (intraseasonal) spatiotemporal variability of surface (0 – 6 cm depth) soil moisture in a quarter section (800 m× 800 m) possessing relatively uniform topography and soil texture but <b>variable</b> <b>land</b> cover. Daily soil moisture measurements were made between June 22 and July 16 using portable impedance probes in a regular 7 × 7 square grid with 100 -m spacings. Initially, the land cover was split between grass and wheat stubble; row tilling on June 27 converted the wheat stubble to bare ground. Geostatistical and median polishing schemes were {{used to analyze the}} within-season evolution of the spatial structure of soil moisture. The effects of daily precipitation, <b>variable</b> <b>land</b> cover, land management, vegetation growth, and microheterogeneity including subgrid-scale variability were all visible in the analysis. Isotropic spatial correlation range for soil moisture varied between 428 m (for spherical and Gaussian models) within the 4 -week-long SGP 97 experiment.

30|$|In {{purview of}} the {{above-mentioned}} concerns, this paper is focused on revealing the complex relationships between the water quality and the related driving factors (climate <b>variables,</b> <b>land</b> use and water quality management) in the Ying River basin in China. Especially, the underlying influences of land use on seasonal pattern of water quality are attempted in this study. The chosen Ying River in China has witnessed the occurrence of five serious water pollution incidents, and hence needs restoration practices. Some studies have been attempted in local regions to investigate the specific toxic pollution (Fu et al. 2014). However, a more detailed comprehensive study is needed to understand the water quality changes in the basin. In this study, several statistical analysis techniques such as cluster analysis, seasonal Kendall test, Moran’s Index are performed for identifying the seasonal and inter-annual pattern in the water quality {{as well as to}} understand the latent spatial structure of the dataset. Further, the relationships between the specific pollutants with the climatic <b>variables,</b> <b>land</b> use and local water quality management are explored through regression and correlation analysis. The main goals of this research are to provide a comprehensive characterization of the water quality evolution in the typically disturbed Ying River basin and give scientific references for the implement of effective water pollution prevention in the future.|$|R

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Controlled visual interpretation of one ERTS- 1 scene {{taken at the}} peak of the growing season has indicated that classification to the ECOCLASS Series level is not entirely satisfactory.

With the exception of shortgrass and wet shrubby meadow classes in the nonforest categories (81 and 100 percent correct, respectively), correct identification of the nonforest classes is so far unacceptable.

When applied at catchment scale water balance predictions were consistent in some years but different in particular years that warrant further investigation. The bottom-up model integrates the impact of different vegetation types, soil types, and management practices, whereas the top-down approach {{has the advantage of}} simplicity and associated decrease in error propagation. There is sufficient consistency in the prediction to suggest value in using a detailed bottom-up model to generate data needed for development and parameterisation of top-down catchment water balance models. The bridging of these two approaches may provide a way forward to increase model simplicity without losing the explanatory capacity necessary to analyse the impact of local management changes on catchment water balance...|$|E

40|$|Interpretation {{of early}} {{established}} farming communities as assemblies of economically independent units was originally advanced {{in the absence}} of detailed evidence for crop handling and land management. The growing availability of such evidence provides an opportunity to revisit this key inference.

Residues of crop handling across a series of buildings point clearly to the salience of co-residential households as contexts not only of storage but also of processing and consumption. Nevertheless, current evidence for use of the local alluvial landscape strongly suggests that <b>variable</b> <b>land</b> quality and access to equitable land holdings were paramount concerns for Çatalhöyük cultivators, demanding supra-household coordination and likely shaping its segmented social morphology.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of tropical montane cloud forest streams, studies investigating aquatic communities in these regions are rare and knowledge on the driving factors of community structure is missing. The objectives of this study therefore were to understand how land-use influences habitat structure and macroinvertebrate communities in cloud forest streams of southern Ecuador. We evaluated these relationships in headwater streams with <b>variable</b> <b>land</b> cover, using multivariate statistics to identify relationships between key habitat variables and assemblage structure, and to resolve differences in composition among sites. Results show that shading intensity, substrate type and pH were the environmental parameters most closely related to variation in community composition observed among sites. In addition, macroinvertebrate density and partly diversity was lower in forested sites, possibly because the pH in forested streams lowered to almost 5 during spates. Standard bioindicator metrics were unable to detect the changes in assemblage structure between disturbed and forested streams. In general, our results indicate that tropical montane headwater streams are complex and heterogeneous ecosystems with low invertebrate densities. We also found that some amount of disturbance, i. e. patchy deforestation, can lead at least initially {{to an increase in}} macroinvertebrate taxa richness of these streams...|$|E
