40|$|Surgical site infections (SSIs) after spinal surgery are {{a serious}} {{complication}} {{that can be}} minimized with prophylaxis. <b>Vancomycin</b> <b>is</b> a common agent used {{in the prevention of}} SSI. Given that <b>vancomycin</b> <b>is</b> renally cleared, its use requires careful observation in dialysis-dependent patients due to toxicity at supratherapeutic levels.

40|$|<b>Vancomycin</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the older}} {{antibiotics}} that has been now in clinical use close to 60 years. Earlier on, <b>vancomycin</b> <b>was</b> associated with many side effects including vestibular and renal, most likely due to impurities contained in early vancomycin lots.

40|$|International audienceLinezolid is an {{antibiotic}} of the oxazolidinone class that has bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against {{a broad range}} of Gram-positive bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.

The aim of this review was to summarise actual data on the pharmacokinetics, safety and clinical use of linezolid in preterm infants. The Medline and EMBASE databases were searched using the term 'linezolid' combined with 'newborn', 'neonate', 'preterm' and 'premature' for papers published between January 1987 and June 2009. Studies reporting on a population including preterm infants and other age groups as well as case reports on preterm infants only were acceptable for analysis. Five studies and eight case reports were identified evaluating linezolid in preterm infants. A dosage regimen of 10 mg/kg body weight given either orally or intravenously every 8 h in infants aged ≥ 1 week and the same dose given every 12 h in infants < 1 week was shown to be safe and effective with a mean treatment duration of 10 - 28 days.
