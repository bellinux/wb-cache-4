40|$|Background. The Indigenous Arctic {{population}} is of Asian descent, and their genetic background {{is different from}} the Caucasian populations. Relatively {{little is known about the}} specific genetic polymorphisms in genes involved in the activation and detoxification mechanisms of environmental contaminants in Inuit and its relation to health risk. The Greenlandic Inuit are highly exposed to legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and an elucidation of gene&#x 2013;environment interactions in relation to health risks is needed. Objectives. The aim of this study was to determine and compare the genotype and allele frequencies of the cytochrome P 450 CYP 1 A 1 Ile 462 <b>Val</b> (<b>rs</b> 1048943), CYP 1 B 1 Leu 432 <b>Val</b> (<b>rs</b> 1056836) and catechol-O-methyltransferase COMT <b>Val</b> 158 Met (<b>rs</b> 4680) in Greenlandic Inuit (n= 254) and Europeans (n= 262) and explore the possible relation between the genotypes and serum levels of POPs. Results. The genotype and allele frequency distributions of the three genetic polymorphisms differed significantly between the Inuit and Europeans. For Inuit, the genotype distribution was more similar to those reported for Asian populations. We observed a significant difference in serum polychlorinated biphenyl (CB- 153) and the pesticide 1, 1 -dichloro- 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) -ethylene (p,p&#x 2032;-DDE) levels between Inuit and Europeans, and for Inuit also associations between the POP levels and genotypes for CYP 1 A 1, CYP 1 B 1 and COMT. Conclusion. Our data provide new information on gene polymorphisms in Greenlandic Inuit that might support evaluation of susceptibility to environmental contaminants and warrant further studies...|$|R

We genotyped these two polymorphisms in 1141 cases with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer (CRC) and 1173 healthy controls to explore their causative association with CRC susceptibility. Overall, no association was observed between these two variants and the risk of CRC. Our meta-analysis also confirmed a lack of overall association. Stratified analyses were performed by age, gender, smoking status, pack-year, drinking status, tumor sites, and Duke’s stages. We found that XPC Lys 939 Gln polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased CRC risk in subjects at 57 years of age or younger (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1. 37, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 004 – 1. 86, p = 0. 047) and non-drinkers (adjusted OR = 1. 53, 95 % CI = 1. 10 – 2. 12, p = 0. 011).

While the level of carrier in the membrane for each mutant remained similar to that for the wild type, analysis of melibiose transport showed an uncoupling of proton cotransport and a drastic reduction in Na+-coupled transport. Second-site revertants were selected on MacConkey plates containing melibiose, and substitutions were found at nine distinct locations in the carrier. Eight revertant substitutions were isolated from the R 52 S strain: Asp- 19 →Gly, Asp- 55 →Asn, Pro- 60 →Gln, Trp- 116 →Arg, Asn- 244 →Ser, Ser- 247 →Arg, Asn- 248 →Lys, and Ile- 352 →Val. Two revertants were also isolated from the R 52 V strain: Trp- 116 →Arg and Thr- 338 →Arg revertants. The R 52 Q strain yielded an Asp- 55 →Asn substitution and a first-site revertant, Lys- 52 (R 52 K). The R 52 K strain had transport properties {{similar to those of}} the wild type. Analysis of melibiose accumulation showed that proton-driven accumulation was still defective in the second-site revertant strains, and only the Trp- 116 →Arg, Ser- 247 →Arg, and Asn- 248 →Lys revertants regained significant Na+-coupled accumulation. In general, downhill melibiose transport in the presence of Na+ was better in the revertant strains than in the parental mutants. Three revertant strains, Asp- 19 →Gly, Asp- 55 →Asn, and Thr- 338 →Arg strains, required a high Na+ concentration (100 mM) for maximal activity. Kinetic measurements showed that the N 248 K and W 116 R revertants lowered the Km for melibiose, while other revertants restored transport velocity. We suggest that the insertion of positive charges on membrane helices is compensating for the loss of Arg- 52 and that helix II is close to helix IV and VII.

40|$|Exercise-induced fatigue {{affects the}} motor {{control and the}} ability to {{generate}} a given force or power. Surface electroencephalography allows researchers to investigate movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP), which reflect preparatory brain activity 1. 5 s before movement onset. Although the MRCP amplitude appears to increase after repetitive single-joint contractions, the effects of large-muscle group dynamic exercise on such pre-motor potential remain to be described. Sixteen volunteers exercised 30 min at 60 % of the maximal aerobic power on a cycle ergometer, followed by a 10 -km all-out time trial. Before and after each of these tasks, knee extensor neuromuscular function was investigated using maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) combined with electrical stimulations of the femoral nerve. MRCP was recorded during 60 knee extensions after each neuromuscular sequence. The exercise resulted in a significant decrease in the knee extensor MVC force after the 30 -min exercise (- 10 ± 8 %) and the time trial (- 21 ± 9 %). The voluntary activation level (VAL; - 6 ± 8 and - 12 ± 10 %), peak twitch (Pt; - 21 ± 16 and - 32 ± 17 %), and paired stimuli (P 100 Hz; - 7 ± 11 and - 12 ± 13 %) were also significantly reduced after the 30 -min exercise and the time trial. The first exercise was followed by a decrease in the MRCP, mainly above the mean activity measured at electrodes FC 1 -FC 2, whereas the reduction observed after the time trial was related to the FC 1 -FC 2 and C 2 electrodes. After both exercises, the reduction in the late MRCP component above FC 1 -FC 2 was significantly correlated with the reduction in P 100 Hz (r = 0. 61), and the reduction in the same component above C 2 was significantly correlated with the reduction in <b>VAL</b> (<b>r</b> = 0. 64). In conclusion, large-muscle group exercise induced a reduction in pre-motor potential, which was related to muscle alterations and resulted in the inability to produce a maximal voluntary contraction...|$|E

40|$|Aims/hypothesis: PARL, {{the gene}} {{encoding}} presenilins-associated rhomboid-like protein, maps to chromosome 3 q 27 within a {{quantitative trait locus}} that influences components of the metabolic syndrome. Recently, an amino acid substitution (Leu 262 <b>Val,</b> <b>rs</b> 3732581) in PARL was associated with fasting plasma insulin levels in a US white population (N= 1031). This variant was also found to modify the positive association between age and fasting insulin. The {{aim of this study}} was to test whether these findings could be replicated in two UK population-based cohorts. Methods: Participants from the Medical Research Council Ely and Hertfordshire cohort studies were genotyped for this variant using a SNaPshot primer extension assay and Taqman assay respectively. Full phenotypic and genotypic data were available for 3, 666 study participants. Results: Based on a dominant model, we found no association between the Leu 262 Val polymorphism and fasting insulin levels (p= 0. 79) or BMI (p= 0. 98). We did not observe the previously reported interaction between age and genotype on fasting insulin (p= 0. 14). Conclusions/interpretation: Despite having greater statistical power, our data do not support the previously reported association between PARL Leu 262 Val and fasting plasma insulin levels, a measure of insulin resistance. Our findings indicate that this variant is unlikely to be an important contributor to insulin resistance in UK populations...|$|R
40|$|Sickle cell {{disease is}} an {{increasing}} global health problem. Estimates suggest that every year approximately 300, 000 infants are born with sickle cell anemia, which is defined as homozygosity for the sickle hemoglobin (HbS) gene (i. e., for a missense mutation [Glu 6 <b>Val,</b> <b>rs</b> 334] in the β-globin gene [HBB]) and that this number could rise to 400, 000 by 2050. 1 Although early diagnosis, penicillin prophylaxis, blood transfusion, transcranial Doppler imaging, hydroxyurea, and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation can dramatically improve survival {{and quality of life}} for patients with sickle cell disease, our understanding of the role of genetic and nongenetic factors in explaining the remarkable phenotypic diversity of this mendelian disease is still limited. Better prediction of the severity of sickle cell disease could lead to more precise treatment and management. Beyond well-known modifiers of disease severity, such as fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and α-thalassemia, other genetic variants might affect specific subphenotypes. Similarly, although the influence of altitude and temperature has long been reflected in advice to patients with sickle cell disease, recent studies of nongenetic factors, including climate and air quality, suggest more complex associations between environmental factors and clinical complications. 2 New treatments and management strategies accounting for these genetic and nongenetic factors could substantially and rapidly {{improve the quality of life}} and reduce health care costs for patients with sickle cell disease...|$|R
40|$|Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP 2) is a {{mitochondrial}} membrane protein that {{plays a role}} in uncoupling electron transport from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formation. Polymorphisms of the UCP 2 gene in humans affect protein expression and function and have been linked to survival into old age. Since UCP 2 is expressed in several brain regions, we investigated in this study whether UCP 2 polymorphisms might 1) affect occurrence of neurodegenerative or mental health disorders and 2) affect measures of brain structure and function. We used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted MRI and resting-state functional MRI in the neuroimaging sub-study of the Whitehall II cohort. Data from 536 individuals aged 60 to 83 years were analyzed. No association of UCP 2 polymorphisms with the occurrence of neurodegenerative disorders or grey and white matter structure or resting-state functional connectivity was observed. However, there was a significant effect on occurrence of mood disorders in men with the minor alleles of - 866 G>A (rs 659366) and Ala 55 <b>Val</b> (<b>rs</b> 660339)) being associated with increasing odds of lifetime occurrence of mood disorders in a dose dependent manner. This result was not accompanied by effects of UCP 2 polymorphisms on brain structure and function, which might either indicate that the sample investigated here was too small and underpowered to find any significant effects, or that potential effects of UCP 2 polymorphisms on the brain are too subtle to be picked up by any of the neuroimaging measures used...|$|R
