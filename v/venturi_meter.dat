25|$|The {{flow speed}} of a fluid can be {{measured}} using a device such as a <b>Venturi</b> <b>meter</b> or an orifice plate, which can be placed into a pipeline to reduce {{the diameter of the}} flow. For a horizontal device, the continuity equation shows that for an incompressible fluid, the reduction in diameter will cause an increase in the fluid flow speed. Subsequently, Bernoulli's principle then shows that there must be a decrease in the pressure in the reduced diameter region. This phenomenon is known as the Venturi effect.|$|E

The specification and implementation of immersion thermocouples and pressure transducers used to directly measure refrigerant. temperatures, absolute pressures, and pressure drops is also described. Using companion data from thennocouples affixed to refrigerant tube surfaces, comparisons are made between surface and refrigerant-side instrumentation methods and recommendations are given regarding the simplest, cheapest, and most accurate methods for measuring refrigerant temperatures, pressures, and mass flow rate in room air conditioners. As well, the intrusive effects of refrigerant-side instrumentation on room air conditioner perfonnance are investigated.

In this study, a new metering method is presented based on homogeneous and separated flow theory; the acceleration pressure drop and the friction pressure drop of Venturi under two-phase flow conditions are considered in new correlation, and its validity is verified through experiment. For low pressure, a new test program has been implemented in Tianjin University’s low-pressure wet gas loop. For high pressure, the National Engineering Laboratory offered their reports on the web, so the coefficients of the new proposed correlation are fitted with all independent data both under high and low pressures.

This balanced flow technology simultaneously measures mass flow rate, volumetric flow rate, and fluid density with little or no straight pipe run requirements. Initially, the balanced plate was a drop in replacement for a traditional orifice plate, but testing revealed substantially better performance as compared to the orifice plate such as, 10 times better accuracy, 2 times faster (shorter distance) pressure recovery, 15 times less acoustic noise energy generation, and 2. 5 times less permanent pressure loss. During 2004 testing at MSFC, testing revealed several configurations of the balanced flow meter that match the accuracy of <b>Venturi</b> <b>meters</b> while having only slightly more permanent pressure loss. However, the balanced meter only requires a 0. 25 inch plate and has no upstream or downstream straight pipe requirements.

The secondary calorimetric is the only one where one can pilot on; it is a combination of measured parameters, of which the feedwater (FW) flow towards the steam generators is the most significant one. This feedwater flow can be measured by means of an ultrasonic flow meter, “LEFM CheckPlus™ system” instead of the commonly used venturis or diaphragms. In the Belgian Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) Doel 4, a new ultrasonic “LEFM CheckPlus™” feedwater flow measuring system has been installed in April 2008. The paper describes the consequences of the installation, as the total error on the secondary calorimetric decreases from the previous 1, 3 % to the current 0, 8 % with a possibility of further reduction to 0, 4 %.
