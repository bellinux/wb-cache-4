5|$|The sea, its life, and its ships {{have been}} {{depicted}} in art {{ranging from the}} simple drawings {{on the walls of}} caves outside Les Eyzies, France, to the early Christian ichthys to the Dutch Hendrik Vroom to Hokusai's ukiyo-e to seascapes by Winslow Homer. During the Golden Age of the Netherlands, artists such as Jan Porcellis, Hendrick Dubbels, Willem <b>van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde</b> the Elder and his son, and Ludolf Bakhuizen celebrated the sea and the Dutch navy at the peak of its military prowess.|$|E
5|$|On November 30, Louisiana Tech {{was invited}} {{to play in the}} Independence Bowl but asked for more time as they were in {{negotiations}} with the Liberty Bowl and Heart of Dallas Bowl. Louisiana Tech athletic director Bruce <b>Van</b> <b>De</b> <b>Velde</b> and WAC commissioner Jeff Hurd both claimed that on December 1, the Liberty Bowl executive director Steve Ehrhart guaranteed the Bulldogs a bowl invite. After the Independence Bowl's deadline for Louisiana Tech to accept their invitation passed, the Independence Bowl selected the MAC's Ohio (8–4) instead. On December 2, the Liberty Bowl extended their remaining bid to Iowa State (6–6) instead of Louisiana Tech (9–3). The Liberty Bowl did not respond to The Times' request for comment on the situation. Louisiana Tech did not end up playing in any bowl game despite boasting the nation's top scoring offense.|$|E

5|$|The sea {{and ships}} have been {{depicted}} in art ranging from simple drawings of dhows {{on the walls}} of huts in Lamu to seascapes by Joseph Turner. The genre of marine art became especially important in the paintings of the Dutch Golden Age, with works showing the Dutch navy at the peak of its military prowess. Artists such as Jan Porcellis, Simon de Vlieger, Jan van de Cappelle, Hendrick Dubbels, Willem <b>van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde</b> the Elder and his son, Ludolf Bakhuizen and Reinier Nooms created maritime paintings {{in a wide variety of}} styles. The Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai created colour prints of the moods of the sea, including The Great Wave off Kanagawa showing the destructive force of the sea at the same time as its ever-changing beauty. The 19th century Romantic artist Ivan Aivazovsky created some 6,000 paintings, the majority of which depict the sea.|$|E
25|$|Belgian {{contributions}} to architecture also {{continued into the}} 19th and 20th centuries, including the work of Victor Horta and Henry <b>van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde,</b> who were major initiators of the Art Nouveau style.|$|E

25|$|<b>Van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde</b> {{was also}} {{important}} as a landscapist, whose scenes included unglamorous figures very different from those in his genre paintings, which were typically set at garden parties in country houses.

25|$|Widely {{exhibited}} in Europe, the Arts and Crafts style's simplicity inspired designers like Henry <b>van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde</b> and styles such as Art Nouveau, the Dutch De Stijl group, Vienna Secession, {{and eventually the}} Bauhaus style.

25|$|Like other {{painters}} {{from the}} Low Countries such as Dirk Maas, Peter Tillemans and William <b>van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde,</b> Wyck moved to England and worked there throughout his life, often under royal patronage, producing many fine works of battle paintings, portraits, hunting scenes and landscapes {{as well as}} advancing the development of British art through teaching.|$|E

25|$|Landscape {{painting}} was as yet little developed in Britain {{at the time}} of the Union, but a tradition of marine art had been established by the father and son both called Willem <b>van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde,</b> who had been the leading Dutch maritime painters until they moved to London in 1673, in the middle of the Third Anglo-Dutch War.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, Brussels {{became one}} of the major European cities for the {{development}} of the Art Nouveau style in the late 1890s. The architects Victor Horta, Paul Hankar, and Henry <b>van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde</b> became particularly famous for their designs, many of which survive today in Brussels. Four buildings designed by Horta are listed by UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Horta's largest work, the Maison du Peuple was demolished in 1960.|$|E
25|$|Directly {{following}} {{the establishment of}} the Geneva Convention, the first national societies were founded in Belgium, Denmark, France, Oldenburg, Prussia, Spain, and Württemberg. Also in 1864, Louis Appia and Charles <b>van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde,</b> a captain of the Dutch Army, became the first independent and neutral delegates to work under the symbol of the Red Cross in an armed conflict. Three years later in 1867, the first International Conference of National Aid Societies for the Nursing of the War Wounded was convened.|$|E

2500|$|Built {{examples}} of expressionist theatres include Henry <b>van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde's</b> {{construction of the}} model theatre for the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition, and Hans Poelzig's grand remodelling of the Grosses Schauspielhaus.

50|$|<b>Van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde's</b> {{design work}} {{received}} good exposure in Germany, through periodicals like Innen-Dekoration, and subsequently he received commissions for interior designs in Berlin. Around {{the turn of}} the century, he designed Villa Leuring in the Netherlands, and Villa Esche in Chemnitz, two works that show his Art Nouveau style in architecture. He also designed the interior of the Folkwang Museum in Hagen (today the building houses the Karl Ernst Osthaus-Museum) and the Nietzsche House in Weimar.|$|R
40|$|Henry <b>van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde's</b> {{intellectual}} {{relation to}} Nietzsche constitutes {{one of the}} interesting episodes in the early developments of Modernism in architecture. On the basic level, it opens the question of the influence of a radical philosopher of Modernity on a contemporary artist: while at another level it raises the question of the correspondence between ‘idea’and ‘form’ {{in the context of an}} architectural problem: the project for the Nietzsche Monument in Weimar. Although this relation has already been explored by other scholars, this paper will look at some of the parallels in the thoughts of the philosopher and the artist, as in their vision of the role of art in culture, while also examining the discrepancies in Henry <b>van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde's</b> understanding, or appropriation, of the Nietzschean message. This is evident in the Nietzsche Monument project, a project that showed the artist's difficulty at the time in conceptualizing a project that would concretize the philosopher's vision. Finally, this paper will explore the parallel notions of power and force, the former being a foundational nation in ihe philosopher's thought, the latter afoundational notion in ihe artist's aesthetic theory.

25|$|Conway {{performed}} Dreaming Transportation: Voice Portraits of the First Women of White Settlement at Port Jackson {{which was}} scripted {{and directed by}} Andrée Greenwell. The performance premiered at the Sydney Festival in 2003 {{and a year later}} was staged again, at the Sydney Opera House. Performing with Conway were Susan Prior, Christine Douglas, Amie McKenna and Jeannie <b>Van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde</b> and musicians, Hope Csuturos (violin), James Nightingale (clarinet, saxophone), Jane Williams (cello), Kim Poole (guitar/mandolin), Denise Papaluca (piano), Mardi Chillingworth (double bass) and Jared Underwood (percussion). The work was inspired by a series of poems by Jordie Albiston.|$|E
25|$|Also {{particularly}} striking are {{the buildings}} in the Art Nouveau style, most famously by the Belgian architects Victor Horta, Paul Hankar and Henry <b>Van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde.</b> Some of Brussels districts were developed during the heyday of Art Nouveau, and many buildings are in this style. Good examples {{can be found in}} Schaerbeek, Etterbeek, Ixelles, and Saint-Gilles. The Major Town Houses of the Architect Victor Horta – Hôtel Tassel (1893), Hôtel Solvay (1894), Hôtel van Eetvelde (1895) and the Horta Museum (1901) – have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000. Another example of Brussels Art Nouveau is the Stoclet Palace (1911), by the Viennese architect Josef Hoffmann, designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in June 2009.|$|E
25|$|Landscapes {{with animals}} in the {{foreground}} were a distinct sub-type, and were painted by Cuyp, Paulus Potter (1625–1654), Albert Jansz. Klomp (1625-1688), Adriaen <b>van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde</b> (1636–1672) and Karel Dujardin (1626–1678, farm animals), with Philips Wouwerman painting horses and riders in various settings. The cow {{was a symbol of}} prosperity to the Dutch, hitherto overlooked in art, and apart from the horse by far the most commonly shown animal; goats were used to indicate Italy. Potter's The Young Bull is an enormous and famous portrait which Napoleon took to Paris (it later returned) though livestock analysts have noted from the depiction of the various parts of the anatomy that {{it appears to be a}} composite of studies of six different animals of widely different ages.|$|E
50|$|Most of <b>Van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde's</b> finest works {{represent}} views off {{the coast}} of Holland, with Dutch shipping. His best productions are delicate, spirited and finished in handling, and correct in the drawing of the vessels and their rigging. The numerous figures are tellingly introduced, and the artist is successful in his renderings of sea, whether in calm or storm. The ships are portrayed with almost photographic accuracy, and are the most precise guides available to the appearance of 17th-century ships.|$|R
50|$|Theodoor Hendrik <b>van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Velde's</b> book Het volkomen huwelijk(The Perfect Marriage), {{published}} in 1926, {{was well known}} inNetherlands, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. In Germany,Die vollkommene Ehe reached its 42nd printing in 1932 despite itsbeing placed {{on the list of}} forbidden books, the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, by the Roman Catholic Church. In Sweden, Detfulländade äktenskapet was widely known although regarded aspornographic and unsuitable for young readers long into the 1960s. InEnglish, Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique has 42printings in its original 1930 edition, and was re{{published in}} neweditions in 1965 and 2000.|$|R
50|$|Storck, {{influenced}} by Jan Baptist Weenix, produced fantastical views of Mediterranean ports, which place merchant shipping a midst architectural ruins, {{depicted in the}} crystal-clear colours of Italian art of the period. This type of scene anticipated the popular 18th-century Italian capriccio. He depicted ships' rigging and technical details with considerable accuracy, which likely shows {{the influence of the}} <b>van</b> <b>de</b> <b>Veldes.</b> His Dutch harbour and river views often include recreational and ceremonial aspects of shipping. He paid particular attention to the display of pleasure yachts, ceremonial gatherings of ships, the passengers and the people watching.|$|R
