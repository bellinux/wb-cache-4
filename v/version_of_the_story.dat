25|$|In some <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>the</b> hill is Penshaw Hill, that {{on which}} the Penshaw Monument now stands, but locally the credit goes to the nearby Worm Hill, in Fatfield. In most <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>the</b> worm {{is large enough to}} wrap itself around the hill seven times. It is said that one can still see <b>the</b> marks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worm on Worm Hill.|$|R
5|$|On 27 July 1936, Udet crashed the He 118 prototype, He 118 V1 D-UKYM. That same day, Charles Lindbergh {{was visiting}} Ernst Heinkel, so Heinkel could only {{communicate}} with Udet by telephone. According to this <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> Heinkel warned Udet about the propeller's fragility. Udet failed to consider this, so in a dive, the engine oversped and the propeller broke away.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} novelised by Nigel Kneale, {{his first book}} since his Somerset Maugham Award-winning short story {{collection}} Tomato Cain was published in 1949. The novelisation expanded on the backgrounds {{of many of the}} characters seen in the story, and added a deeper, more physical, relationship between Quatermass and Annie Morgan. It was this <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> with which Kneale was most pleased.|$|E
5|$|This <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> {{appears in}} Virgil's Aeneid, in a passage {{describing}} {{a series of}} paintings decorating {{the walls of a}} temple of Juno. The painting immediately next to the one depicting Troilus shows the death of Rhesus, another character killed because of prophecies linked to the fall of Troy. Other pictures are similarly calamitous.|$|E

5|$|Campbell Playhouse (CBS Radio, March 31, 1939). Directed and {{introduced}} by Orson Welles. This was a non-musical <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> {{that was based}} more closely on Edna Ferber's novel than on the musical. From the original stage cast Helen Morgan repeated her portrayal of Julie, here singing one song not from the musical. Welles portrayed Cap'n Andy, Margaret Sullavan was Magnolia, and author Edna Ferber made her acting debut as Parthy. This version made Julie into an illegal alien who must be deported.|$|E
5|$|Carter's story draws {{heavily on}} Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and {{particularly}} on James Whale's 1931 film <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> The script {{had been written}} specifically with singer Cher and actress Roseanne Barr in mind, but both were unavailable {{at the time of}} shooting. Talk-show host Jerry Springer appeared as himself, and Chris Owens—who appeared in later episodes as FBI agent Jeffrey Spender—played The Great Mutato. The episode was filmed in black-and-white, with a sky backdrop created to imitate the style of old Frankenstein films. Owens wore makeup and prosthetics that took several hours to apply.|$|E

5|$|Early Greek {{sources have}} it that Philomela {{was turned into}} a swallow, which has no song; Procne turns into a nightingale, singing a {{beautiful}} but sad song in remorse. Later sources, among them Ovid, Hyginus, and the Bibliotheca of Pseudo-Apollodorus, and in modern literature the English romantic poets like Keats write that although she was tongueless, Philomela {{was turned into a}} nightingale, and Procne into a swallow. Eustathius' <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> has the sisters reversed, so that Philomela married Tereus and that Tereus lusted after Procne.|$|E
5|$|In Hans Christian Andersen's <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> a bluebird {{had been}} viewing Thumbelina's story since the {{beginning}} and had {{been in love with}} her since.

There, he tells Thumbelina's story to a man who is implied to be Andersen himself and chronicles the story in a book.|$|E
5|$|In another <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> {{the king}} adopted {{all of the}} {{children}} of his sister Rangorimanana. He then devised a test to determine which one would succeed him.

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{version of}} the Romeo and Juliet tale akin to Shakespeare's play {{is the story of}} Mariotto and Gianozza by Masuccio Salernitano, in the 33rd novel of his Il Novellino published in 1476. Salernitano sets the story in Siena and insists its events took place in his own lifetime. His <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> includes the secret marriage, the colluding friar, the fray where a prominent citizen is killed, Mariotto's exile, Gianozza's forced marriage, the potion plot, and the crucial message that goes astray. In this version, Mariotto is caught and beheaded and Gianozza dies of grief.|$|E

5|$|While Ovid's {{retelling of}} the myth is the more famous <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> he had several ancient sources on which to rely before he {{finished}} the Metamorphoses in A.D. 8. Many of these sources were doubtless available to Ovid during his lifetime but have been lost or come to us at present only in fragments. In his version, Ovid recast and combined many elements from these ancient sources. Because his is the most complete, lasting version {{of the myth}}, it {{is the basis for}} many later works.|$|E
5|$|After {{three weeks}} of jury selection, and eight trial days, the defense made their closing {{statements}} on March 7 in about three hours. They presented three witnesses and then rested their case. Fischer's mother took the stand and gave her final testimony, and her <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> The judge told prosecutors {{that they had to}} choose to charge the defendants with capital murder or conspiracy to commit murder. The prosecution decided on the capital murder charge, and sought the death penalty for both Cisneros and Garza. The following day, the jury convicted Cisneros and Garza of capital murder for arranging Fischer's death. Neither of them showed any emotion when the verdict was given. Cisneros then removed her jewelry and was taken to the Cameron County jail with Garza. The jurors met the following day to discuss the punishment phase of the trial.|$|E
5|$|Boccaccio {{fills in}} the history before the hostage {{exchange}} as follows. Troilus mocks the lovelorn glances of other men who put their trust in women before falling victim to love himself when he sees Cressida, here a young widow, in the Palladium, the temple of Athena. Troilus keeps his love secret and is made miserable by it. Pandarus, Troilus' best friend and Cressida's cousin in this <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> acts as go-between after persuading Troilus to explain his distress. In accordance with the conventions of courtly love, Troilus' love remains secret from all except Pandarus, until Cassandra eventually divines the reason for Troilus' subsequent distress.|$|E

This detail, however, is not present in early <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>The</b> next morning, Colindres discovered that he had been sleeping on a tiny statue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blessed Virgin Mary, which he took home with him and set up on the family altar in his mother's house.|$|R
