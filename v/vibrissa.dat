50|$|Nia <b>vibrissa</b> is {{a species}} of fungus in the order Agaricales. The species is adapted to a marine {{environment}} and is a wood-rotting fungus, producing small, gasteroid basidiocarps (fruit bodies) on driftwood, submerged timber, mangrove wood, and similar substrates. The spores have long, hair-like projections and are widely dispersed in sea water, giving Nia <b>vibrissa</b> a cosmopolitan distribution.|$|E
5000|$|Nia <b>vibrissa</b> was {{originally}} described in 1959 from submerged wood {{off the coast}} of Florida. The Latin epithet [...] "vibrissa" [...] (meaning [...] "bristly") refers to the hair-like appendages on the spores. It was initially thought to be a deuteromycete (an asexual or mould-like fungus), but was subsequently found to be the sexual state of a basidiomycete, one of the few such known from the marine environment. Since its fruit bodies are enclosed and its spores are passively released, Nia <b>vibrissa</b> was considered to be a gasteromycete and was placed in its own family within the Melanogastrales, a now obsolete order of terrestrial false truffles.|$|E
50|$|Folliculitis nares perforans is {{characterized}} by small pustules near {{the tip of the}} inside of the nose, lesions that become crusted, and when the crust is removed it is found that the bulbous end of the affected <b>vibrissa</b> is embedded in the inspissated material.|$|E
40|$|The {{motion of}} {{isolated}} seal <b>vibrissae</b> due to low frequency sound in air has been measured using a microscope {{with a video}} camera and modeled using an FEM method with good agreement between the measurements and the model; the model has also been used to predict the motion of seal <b>vibrissae</b> in water. The shape of the seal <b>vibrissae</b> {{is that of a}} tapered right rectangular prism, unlike that of the previously studied rat <b>vibrissae</b> which are conical in shape. Moreover, unlike rat <b>vibrissae</b> which oscillate {{in the direction of the}} sound stimulus, two different modes of vibration of seal <b>vibrissae</b> were observed - one corresponding to the wider side being stimulated and one with the narrow side stimulated. The tuning of the seal <b>vibrissae</b> was much sharper than those of rat <b>vibrissae,</b> with quality factors about three times as large as those of rat <b>vibrissae.</b> As shown by the model, this increased sharpness is caused by the larger cross-sectional areas (by more than a factor of ten) of the seal <b>vibrissae.</b> This increased sharpness may be necessary for seal <b>vibrissae</b> so that they can have tuning in water, where the drag more heavily dampens the tuning than in air. The results suggest that <b>vibrissae</b> tuning may be important in the seal's ability to track the wake of its prey...|$|R
50|$|Usually <b>vibrissae</b> {{are found}} on the facial regions of {{terrestrial}} and non-sirenian aquatic animals and are called whiskers. Manatees, however, have <b>vibrissae</b> all over their bodies. The <b>vibrissae</b> located in their facial region are roughly 30 times denser than the <b>vibrissae</b> {{on the rest of}} their body. Their mouth consists of very mobile prehensile lips which are used for grasping food and objects. The <b>vibrissae</b> on these lips are turned outward during grasping and are used in locating vegetation. Their oral disks also contain <b>vibrissae</b> which have been classified as bristle-like hairs that are used in nongrasping investigation of objects and food.|$|R
500|$|Unlike {{terrestrial}} mammals, such as rodents, pinnipeds do {{not move}} their <b>vibrissae</b> over an object when examining it but instead extend their moveable whiskers and {{keep them in the}} same position. By holding their <b>vibrissae</b> steady, pinnipeds are able to maximize their detection ability. The <b>vibrissae</b> of phocids are undulated and wavy while otariid and walrus <b>vibrissae</b> are smooth. Research is ongoing to determine the function, if any, of these shapes on detection ability. The <b>vibrissa's</b> angle relative to the flow, not the shape, however, seems {{to be the most important}} factor. The <b>vibrissae</b> of some otariids grow quite long—those of the Antarctic fur seal can reach [...] Walruses have the most <b>vibrissae,</b> at 600–700 individual hairs. These are important for detecting their prey on the muddy sea floor. In addition to foraging, <b>vibrissae</b> may also play a role in navigation; spotted seals appear to use them to detect breathing holes in the ice.|$|R
50|$|The {{effector}} system generating whisking comprises {{a set of}} “extrinsic” muscles controlling movements of the mystacial pad {{and a group of}} “intrinsic” (follicular) muscles, producing <b>vibrissa</b> protraction. The extrinsic muscles in the mystacial pad move many or all of the macrovibrissae together. However, the individual follicles of some groups of facial vibrissae in some species are also motile. A small muscle 'sling' is attached to each macrovibrissa and can move it more-or-less independently of the others. <b>Vibrissa</b> retraction is thought to be a passive process produced by rebound of stretched follicular muscle. Whisking movements are amongst the fastest produced by mammals. In animals that are capable of whisking at high frequencies, the whisking musculature contains a high proportion of type 2B muscle fibers that can support faster contractions than normal skeletal muscles.|$|E
50|$|Nia is a genus of {{fungi in}} the family Niaceae. The genus {{contains}} three species adapted to a marine environment. All are wood-rotting fungi, producing small, gasteroid basidiocarps (fruit bodies) on driftwood, submerged timber, mangrove wood, and similar substrates. The type species, Nia <b>vibrissa,</b> is widespread in temperate and tropical seas.|$|E
5000|$|Central pattern {{generators}} {{can also}} play a role in rhythm generation for other functions in vertebrate animals. For example, the rat <b>vibrissa</b> system uses an unconventional CPG for whisking movements. [...] "Like other CPGs, the whisking generator can operate without cortical input or sensory feedback. However, unlike other CPGs, <b>vibrissa</b> motoneurons actively participate in rhythmogenesis by converting tonic serotonergic inputs into the patterned motor output responsible for movement of the vibrissae." [...] Breathing is another non-locomotive function of central pattern generators. For example, larval amphibians accomplish gas exchange largely through rhythmic ventilation of the gills. A study by Broch, et al. showed that lung ventilation in the tadpole brainstem may be driven by a pacemaker-like mechanism, whereas the respiratory CPG adapts in the adult bullfrog as it matures. Thus, CPGs hold a broad range of functions in the vertebrate animal and are widely adaptable and variable with age, environment and behavior.|$|E
40|$|<b>Vibrissae</b> (whiskers) are {{important}} {{components of the}} mammalian tactile sensory system, and primarily function as detectors of environmental vibrotactile cues. Pinnipeds possess {{the largest and most}} highly innervated <b>vibrissae</b> among mammals and their <b>vibrissae</b> demonstrate a diversity of shapes and likely mechanical properties. These two characteristics {{are important}} for vibrotactile sensory perception. <b>Vibrissae</b> of most phocid seals exhibit a beaded morphology with repeated sequences of crests and troughs along their length. I comparatively characterized differences in <b>vibrissae</b> morphologies among phocid species with a beaded profile, phocid species with a smooth profile, and otariids with a smooth profile using traditional and geometric morphometric methods to test the hypothesis that vibrissal morphologies are species-specific manipulations of a common pattern. The traditional and geometric morphometric datasets were subsequently combined by mathematically scaling each to true rank, followed by a single eigendecomposition. Quadratic discriminant function analysis demonstrated that 79. 3, 97. 8 and 100 % of individuals could be correctly classified to taxon based on vibrissal shape variables in the traditional, geometric and combined morphometric analyses, respectively. At least three separate morphologies were identified since phocids with beaded <b>vibrissae,</b> phocids with smooth <b>vibrissae,</b> and otariids each occupied distinct morphospace in the geometric morphometric and combined data analyses. Another important characteristic that influences the transduction of vibrotactile information to the mechanoreceptors in the follicle-sinus complex is the materials properties of the <b>vibrissae.</b> <b>Vibrissae</b> were modeled as cantilever beams and flexural stiffness (EI) was measured to test the hypotheses that the shape of beaded <b>vibrissae</b> reduces flexural stiffness and that <b>vibrissae</b> are anisotropic (orientations differ in EI). Species were significantly different and smooth <b>vibrissae</b> were generally stiffer than beaded <b>vibrissae.</b> Beaded <b>vibrissae</b> decrease vibrations in flow, which, combined with lower flexural stiffness values, may enhance detection of small changes in flow from swimming prey. The anterior plane of the <b>vibrissae</b> is likely the most biologically significant in tracking hydrodynamic trails but had lower flexural stiffness values than the dorsoventral orientation. There is likely a complex interaction between shape and mechanical properties in pinniped <b>vibrissae</b> but the ecological and functional implications are currently unknown...|$|R

40|$|Two {{types of}} vibrissal surface structures, {{undulated}} and smooth, exist among pinnipeds. Most Phocidae have <b>vibrissae</b> with undulated surfaces, while Otariidae, Odobenidae, {{and a few}} phocid species possess <b>vibrissae</b> with smooth surfaces. Variations in cross-sectional profile and orientation of the <b>vibrissae</b> also exist between pinniped species. These factors may influence {{the way that the}} <b>vibrissae</b> behave when exposed to water flow. This study investigated the effect that vibrissal surface structure and orientation have on flow-induced vibrations of pinniped <b>vibrissae.</b> Laser vibrometry was used to record vibrations along the whisker shaft from the undulated <b>vibrissae</b> of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) and the smooth <b>vibrissae</b> of California sea lions (Zalophus californianus). Vibrations along the whisker shaft were measured in a flume tank, at three orientations (0 °, 45 °, 90 °) to the water flow. The results show that vibration frequency and velocity ranges were similar for both undulated and smooth <b>vibrissae.</b> Angle of orientation, rather than surface structure, had the greatest effect on flow-induced vibrations. Vibration velocity was up to 60 times higher when the wide, flat aspect of the whisker faced into the flow (90 °), compared to when the thin edge faced into the flow (0 °). Vibration frequency was also dependent on angle of orientation. Peak frequencies were measured up to 270 Hz and were highest at the 0 ° orientation for all whiskers. Furthermore, CT scanning was used to quantify the three-dimensional structure of pinniped <b>vibrissae</b> that may influence flow interactions. The CT data provide evidence that all <b>vibrissae</b> are flattened in cross-section to some extent and that differences exist in the orientation of this profile with respect to the major curvature of the hair shaft. These data support the hypothesis that a compressed cross-sectional profile may {{play a key role in}} reducing self-noise of the <b>vibrissae...</b>|$|R

This comparison is sustained in the narrow body and very short bushy tail which measures little more than one third of the combined head-and-body length, with the width of the brush a fraction under 4 in. The fleshy, softlyfurred, triangulate ears remain erect, though rounded and curved forward in conch-like fashion. Colour (Ridgway) of the head a clear tawny brown; the back a darker russet-brown owing to the admixture of blackish-brown hairs, the darker hairs enclosing a yellowish [...] "saddlemark" [...] somewhat more conspicuous in the female.

40|$|SummaryThe trigeminal loop in the {{brainstem}} {{comprises the}} innermost level of sensorimotor feedback in the rat <b>vibrissa</b> system.

We demonstrate, using in vitro and in vivo recordings, that the trigeminal loop consists of excitatory pathways from <b>vibrissa</b> sensory inputs to <b>vibrissa</b> motoneurons in the facial nucleus. We further show that the trigeminal loop implements a rapidly depressing reflex that provides positive sensory feedback to the <b>vibrissa</b> musculature during simulated whisking and contact.

To this end a transitory flaccid paralysis of the <b>vibrissae</b> muscle was induced in adult rats that underwent two unilateral injections of 8 U of botulinum toxin (BTX) into a vibrissal pad, at a duration of 12 days from one another. The compound muscle action potential (MAP) of the <b>vibrissae</b> muscle began to reappear 4 weeks after the first BTX injection. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) was used to map rat motor cortices 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 weeks after the first BTX injection. Findings demonstrated that: (i) contralateral <b>vibrissae</b> movement reappears in the medial part of its normal cortical territory when the MAP is almost 10 % of the control value; in the remaining part, ICMS elicits eye, ipsilateral <b>vibrissae,</b> neck and forelimb movements; (ii) the contralateral <b>vibrissae</b> movement reappears in sites where ipsilateral <b>vibrissae</b> and/or neck movement are co-represented; (iii) as MAP recovers, the <b>vibrissae</b> representation expands until it recovers the 90. 8 % of its territory after 7 weeks, when the MAP was almost 43. 4 % of the control value; (iv) from 4 to 7 weeks, the ICMS-evoked contralateral <b>vibrissae</b> movement shows a significantly higher electrical threshold vs. the control group; (v) recovery of the baseline excitability uniformly involves the <b>vibrissae</b> representation 1 week later, after its cortical territory has recovered 93. 1 % of the control value and the MAP has returned to 78. 8 % of the baseline value...|$|R
5000|$|Pinnipeds have {{well-developed}} tactile senses. Their mystacial <b>vibrissae</b> {{have ten}} times the innervation of terrestrial mammals, allowing them to effectively detect vibrations in the water. These vibrations are generated, for example, when a fish swims through water. Detecting vibrations is useful when the animals are foraging and may add to or even replace vision, particularly in darkness. [...] Harbor seals have been observed following varying paths of another seal that swam ahead several minutes before, similar to a dog following a scent trail, and even to discriminate the species {{and the size of}} the fish responsible for the trail. [...] Blind ringed seals have even been observed successfully hunting on their own in Lake Saimaa, likely relying on their <b>vibrissae</b> to gain sensory information and catch prey. Unlike terrestrial mammals, such as rodents, pinnipeds do not move their <b>vibrissae</b> over an object when examining it but instead extend their moveable whiskers and keep them in the same position.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} how facial nerve regeneration shapes movement representation patterns in previously disconnected motor cortices. Electrical microstimulation {{was used to}} bilaterally map the motor cortices of adult rats subjected to unilateral facial nerve lesion and reanastomosis stamps at the stylomastoid foramen level. The motor cortex output patterns of two groups of experimental hemispheres (contralateral to lesioned side) were compared before and after facial nerve reinnervation. The motor cortex output patterns in the control hemispheres (ipsilateral to the lesioned side) were used as reference. Before facial nerve reinnervation, the motor cortex forelimb and eye output area extended into the <b>vibrissa</b> area; such enlargement did not occupy the medial part of the former <b>vibrissa</b> area where ipsilateral <b>vibrissa</b> or neck movements were represented. After facial nerve reinnervation, the contralateral <b>vibrissa</b> movement reorganized into a shrunken cortical area corresponding to the medial portion of the former <b>vibrissa</b> representation, i. e., where the ipsilateral <b>vibrissa</b> and neck movements were mainly represented prior to facial nerve reinnervation. The enlargement of the forelimb and eye representation remained unchanged, even after the <b>vibrissa</b> motor innervation was reactivated. Before facial nerve reinnervation into expanded forelimb and eye representations, a minimal current was required to evoke these movements, which did not vary from the normal range. A higher current was necessary to evoke the ipsilateral <b>vibrissa</b> and neck movements in the medial part of the <b>vibrissa</b> representation than the threshold needed to elicit the <b>vibrissa</b> movement normally represented in this cortical region. After facial nerve reinnervation, the overall current required to evoke movement remained {{the same as that}} which evoked movement before the <b>vibrissa</b> motor innervation was reactivated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{array of}} vibrissae on a rat's face {{is the first}} stage of a {{high-resolution}} tactile sensing system. Recently, it was discovered that vibrissae (whiskers) resonate when stimulated at specific frequencies, generating several-fold increases in motion amplitude. We investigated the neural correlates of <b>vibrissa</b> resonance in trigeminal ganglion and primary somatosensory cortex (SI) neurons (regular and fast spiking units) by presenting low-amplitude, high-frequency <b>vibrissa</b> stimulation. We found that somatosensory neurons showed band-pass tuning and enhanced sensitivity to small amplitude stimuli, reflecting the resonance amplification of <b>vibrissa</b> motion. Further, a putative somatotopic map of frequency selectivity was observed in SI, with isofrequency columns extending along the representations of arcs of vibrissae, in agreement with the gradient in <b>vibrissa</b> resonance across the <b>vibrissa</b> pad. These findings suggest several parallels between frequency processing in the <b>vibrissa</b> system and the auditory system and have important implications for detection and discrimination of tactile information...|$|E
40|$|The present {{experiment}} studies representation {{patterns in}} the motor cortex (M 1) of adult rats, 1, 3, 6, and 12 days after unilateral injection of Botulinum Toxin (BTX) into the <b>vibrissa</b> pad. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) was used to evidence changes in the representation over time and in the current thresholds required to evoke movements inside the disconnected <b>vibrissa</b> region. After 1 day, isolated as well as contiguous negative sites were observed within the motor cortex corresponding to the disconnected <b>vibrissa</b> region. Thereafter the percentage of unresponsive sites decreased so that after 6 days, the number of unresponsive sites was not significantly higher {{than those in the}} control hemispheres. Within the disconnected <b>vibrissa</b> region, electrical stimulation elicited forelimb, eye, ipsilateral <b>vibrissa</b> and neck movements. Following BTX injection, the enlargement of the forelimb representation into the disconnected <b>vibrissa</b> representation began during the first day and stabilized during the second week after injection. In the first days, stimulation thresholds in expanded forelimb sites were higher than those required for similar movement in normal M 1 forelimb representation. These thresholds then declined so that in 6 days they were similar to normal. There was no clear evidence that stimulation of sites in the medial part of disconnected vibrissa-cortex evoked eye movements during the first 6 days after BTX injection. After this time, thresholds required to evoke eye movement in expanded sites were generally similar to, and never higher than, those needed to evoke this movement in control sites. Intermingled ipsilateral <b>vibrissa</b> and neck movement occupies part of the medial <b>vibrissa</b> region. Over the 12 days, extension of the ipsilateral <b>vibrissa</b> representation shrank while the representation of neck movement remained unchanged. Throughout the entire time there was no change in the excitability of these sites and the thresholds remained higher than that needed to elicit the <b>vibrissa</b> movement normally represented in this cortical region. No significant differences in threshold were found over time for any of the other movement categories represented in M 1. These results indicate that, over time, the new movements inside the disconnected <b>vibrissa</b> region develop differently in M 1 following peripheral motor disconnection. The implications for mechanisms involved in cortical plasticity are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{superior}} colliculus, usually {{considered a}} visuomotor structure, is anatomically positioned to perform sensorimotor transformations in other modalities. While {{there is evidence}} for its potential participation in sensorimotor loops of the rodent <b>vibrissa</b> system, {{little is known about}} its functional role in <b>vibrissa</b> sensation or movement. In anesthetized rats, we characterized extracellularly recorded responses of collicular neurons to different types of <b>vibrissa</b> stimuli. Results Collicular neurons had large receptive fields (median = 14. 5 vibrissae). Single units displayed responses with short latencies (5. 6 ± 0. 2 msec, median = 5. 5) and relatively large magnitudes (1. 2 ± 0. 1 spikes/stimulus, median = 1. 2). Individual neurons could entrain to repetitive <b>vibrissa</b> stimuli delivered at ≤ 20 Hz, with little reduction in phase locking, even when response magnitude was decreased. Neurons responded preferentially to <b>vibrissa</b> deflections at particular angles, with 43 % of the cells having high (≥ 5) angular selectivity indices. Conclusion Results are consistent with a proposed role of the colliculus in somatosensory-mediated orienting. These properties, together with the connections of the superior colliculus in sensorimotor loops, are consistent with its involvement in orienting, alerting and attentive functions related to the <b>vibrissa</b> system. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{accumulation}} of anatomical, behavioral, and electrophysiological evidence {{allows us to}} identify the neuronal circuitry that is involved with vibrissa-mediated sensation and the control of rhythmic <b>vibrissa</b> movement. Anatomical evidence points to a multiplicity of closed sensorimotor loops, while electrophysiological data delineate the flow of electrical signals in these pathways. These loops process sensory input from the vibrissae and send projections to direct <b>vibrissa</b> movement, starting {{at the level of}} the hindbrain and proceeding toward loops that involve multiple structures in the forebrain. The nature of the vibrissa-related electrical signals in behaving animals has been studied extensively at the level of neocortical loops. Two types of spike signal are observed that serve as a reference of <b>vibrissa</b> motion: a fast signal that correlates with the relative phase of the vibrissae within a whisk cycle and a slow signal that correlates with the amplitude, and possibly the set-point, of the vibrissae during a whisk. Both signals are observed in <b>vibrissa</b> primary sensory (S 1) cortex, and in some cases they are sufficiently robust to allow <b>vibrissa</b> position to be accurately estimated from the spike train of a single neuron. Unlike the case for S 1 cortex, only the slow signal has been observed in <b>vibrissa</b> primary motor (M 1) cortex. The control capabilities of M 1 cortex were estimated from experiments with anesthetized animals in which progressive areas along the <b>vibrissa</b> motor branch were microstimulated with rhythmically applied currents.

40|$|Psychophysical {{techniques}} {{were employed to}} measure {{the sensitivity of the}} <b>vibrissae</b> of a harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) to sinusoidal vibrations ranging between 100 and 2500 hertz. A control test ensured that the seal was not responding to auditory or other extraneous components of the signal. Vibration detection thresholds were found to decrease with increased frequency up to 1000 hertz and remain relatively constant thereafter. These data were used for evaluation of some previous hypotheses of <b>vibrissae</b> function. Calculations revealed that seals should be able to use their <b>vibrissae</b> to detect objects such as swimming fish vibrating underwater at close range and tactually discriminate between objects (like fish with different scale patterns). Also, <b>vibrissae</b> could theoretically detect underwater sounds produced by fish, but at too close a range to have any practical value...|$|R
