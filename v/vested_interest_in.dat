5|$|Critics of the ESRB have {{asserted}} that the organization has {{a conflict of interest}} because of its <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the video game industry, and that the ESRB does not rate certain games, such as the Grand Theft Auto series, harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, other critics have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E

30|$|The {{transition}} {{might be}} blocked due to <b>vested</b> <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> {{the status quo}} {{by people who have}} power in the current system, in particular, business people, politicians or other decision makers [41]. Especially in the case of mobility, there are strong <b>vested</b> <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> the automobile and fossil fuel industry [56]. Here, pressure from civil society might lead to changed perceptions of those in power. Additionally, new business-strategies (e.g., “green economy”) and perspectives (e.g., “green services and solutions”) and the recognition of niches (e.g., battery development, sharing platforms or ICT services) or promising developments (e.g., paradigms change of mobility and e-mobility powered by renewable energy) contribute to overcoming the barriers. This can be supported by new forms of direct democracy and public participation that has decisive power, as well as awareness-raising regarding the opportunities that sustainable mobility can provide [57].|$|R

Belgium and the United Kingdom had a <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> maintaining their control over much of the country's copper industry during the Congolese transition from colonialism to independence. Concerns about the nationalisation of the copper industry could have provided a financial incentive to remove either Lumumba or Hammarskjöld.|$|E

The issue escalated with the captain's brother, Widerøe's chief pilot John Hovring, stating that the crash must have occurred as a result of a collision with a fighter or missile. He further stated that General Mohr as an air force officer had a <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> covering up the real cause.|$|E

It was also claimed that the tribunal was improperly constituted because two of the judges were relatively junior, and that the two foreign judges were from countries not noted for judicial independence. Salleh demanded to be tried by peers of equal standing – retired Lord presidents, if need be. He also demanded that the tribunal make its hearings public. All of these claims were rejected by the tribunal, and Salleh withdrew from the proceedings.|$|E

Satisfying {{the need for new}} legislation, the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) was enacted on November 8, 1984. Most notably, the PMRS provided a greater level of evaluation accuracy and imposed minimum and maximum levels of pay increase to limit disparity among merit pay employees. PMRS also created Performance Standard Review Boards for each department and required that {{at least half of the}} board be members who were under the merit pay system. This requirement ensured that at least some board members had a <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> dealing with potential problems and concerns.|$|E

In 1942, government embarked on a complex, but erratic, investigation into the presence of former Komsomolists among Odessa's public sector employees. Allegations regarding Pântea's complicity in some acts of corruption prompted additional surveillance from Romanian Special Intelligence. Its subsequent reports accused the Mayor and some in his staff of keeping company with covert communists, and of trading {{on the black market}} of Chișinău. Later, sources adverse to Pântea claimed that he was the main beneficiary of trade in Moldovan wine and used goods, and that he had <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> aiding the Transnistrian Jews, who were his business partners.|$|E
