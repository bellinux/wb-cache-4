25|$|In {{order for}} there to be a correspondence, the earlier theory has to have a domain of validity—it must work under some conditions. Not all {{theories}} have a domain of <b>validity.</b> <b>For</b> example, there is no limit where Newton's mechanics reduces to Aristotle's mechanics because Aristotle's mechanics, although academically dominant for 18 centuries, do not have any domain of validity.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{giving more}} respectability to the geocentric view than Newtonian physics does, {{relativity}} is not geocentric. Rather, relativity {{states that the}} Sun, the Earth, the Moon, Jupiter, or any other point for that matter could be chosen as a center {{of the solar system}} with equal <b>validity.</b> <b>For</b> this reason Robert Sungenis, a modern geocentrist, spent much of Volume I of his book Galileo Was Wrong: The Church Was Right critiquing and trying to unravel the Special and General theories of Relativity.|$|E

On the other hand, the existence of overvotes and of undervotes is one of the grounds for requesting that an electoral packet be opened and recounted. Mochán notes that the official totals does not include the information on leftover blank ballots, so that a verification of undervotes and overvotes in the case of adding up errors is impossible.|$|E
25|$|Quasi-experimental design refers {{especially}} to situations precluding random assignment to different conditions. Researchers can use {{common sense to}} consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the study's <b>validity.</b> <b>For</b> example, in research on {{the best way to}} affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school, school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms, in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments. Psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{important}} to note that self-reported and Trait EI measures retain a fair amount of predictive <b>validity</b> <b>for</b> job performance after controlling Big Five traits and IQ. Newman, Joseph, and MacCann contend that the greater predictive validity of Trait EI measures is due to their inclusion of content related to achievement motivation, self efficacy, and self-rated performance. Meta-analytic evidence confirms that self-reported emotional intelligence predicting job performance is due to mixed EI and trait EI measures' tapping into self-efficacy and self-rated performance, in addition to the domains of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and IQ. As such, the predictive ability of mixed EI to job performance drops to nil when controlling for these factors.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to analyze the {{complexity}} of strict implication (together with falsum, conjunction and disjunction). We prove that Ladner’s Theorem remains valid when we restrict the language to the strict implication fragment, and that the same holds for Hemaspaandra’s Theorem. As a consequence we have that the <b>validity</b> problem <b>for</b> most standard normal modal logics {{is the same one}} than the <b>validity</b> problem <b>for</b> its strict implication fragment. We also prove that the <b>validity</b> problems <b>for</b> Visser’s basic propositional logic and Visser’s formal propositional logic are PSPACE complete. Finally, a polynomial reduction from most standard normal modal logics into its strict implication fragment is presented...|$|R

25|$|One {{study done}} by Simon Vermeier used neuroimaging to {{investigate}} serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in 9 dogs with Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) {{to measure the}} serotonin 2A receptor availability. When compared to the 15 non-compulsive dogs used as a control group, the dogs with CCD {{were found to have}} lower receptor availability as well as lower subcortical perfusion and hypothalamic availability. The results of this study provide evidence that there are imbalanced serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways in dogs. Similarities between other studies about human OCD provide construct <b>validity</b> <b>for</b> this study, which suggests that the research will be valid and useful in continuing to investigate brain activity and drug treatment in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.|$|E
25|$|ITU-R 468 noise {{weighting}} was therefore developed to more accurately reflect the subjective loudness {{of all types}} of noise, as opposed to tones. This curve, which came out of work done by the BBC Research Department, and was standardised by the CCIR and later adopted by many other standards bodies (IEC, BSI) and, , is maintained by the ITU. It became widely used in Europe, especially in broadcasting, and was adopted by Dolby Laboratories who realised its superior <b>validity</b> <b>for</b> their purposes when measuring noise on film soundtracks and compact cassette systems. Its advantages over A-weighting is less understood in the US, where the use of A-weighting still predominates. It is universally used by broadcasters in Britain, Europe, and former countries of the British Empire such as Australia and South Africa.|$|E

500|$|The Michael DeGroote School of Medicine has notably {{developed}} admission {{tests that}} has since become adopted by other schools. In 2001, they developed the multiple-mini interview {{in an effort to}} address long-standing concerns over standard panel interviews; viewed as poor reflectors for [...] medical school performance. This format uses short, independent assessments in a timed circuit to obtain aggregate scores in interpersonal skills, professionalism, ethical/moral judgment, and critical thinking to assess candidates. The multiple-mini interview has consistently shown to have a higher predictive <b>validity</b> <b>for</b> future performance than traditional interviews. The multiple-mini interview process has since been adopted by the majority of Canadian medical schools, {{as well as a number}} of medical schools in the United States. In 2010, the medical school developed the Computer-based Assessment for Sampling Personal Characteristics, in order to better assess the personal characteristics of the applicant. A number of other medical schools have since adopted the CASPer test, including New York Medical College, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, and the University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine.|$|E
500|$|Clause 61 of Magna Carta {{contained}} {{a commitment from}} John that he would [...] "seek to obtain nothing from anyone, in our own person or through someone else, whereby any of these grants or liberties may be revoked or diminished". Despite this, the King appealed to Pope Innocent for help in July, arguing that the charter compromised the Pope's rights as John's feudal lord. As part of the June peace deal, the barons were supposed to surrender London by 15 August, but this they refused to do. Meanwhile, instructions from the Pope arrived in August, written before the peace accord, {{with the result that}} papal commissioners excommunicated the rebel barons and suspended Langton from office in early September. Once aware of the charter, the Pope responded in detail: in a letter dated 24 August and arriving in late September, he declared the charter to be [...] "not only shameful and demeaning but also illegal and unjust" [...] since John had been [...] "forced to accept" [...] it, and accordingly the charter was [...] "null, and void of all <b>validity</b> <b>for</b> ever"; under threat of excommunication, the King was not to observe the charter, nor the barons try to enforce it.|$|E

Since this is an identity of symmetric polynomials (homogeneous) of degree k, its <b>validity</b> <b>for</b> any number of variables follows from its <b>validity</b> <b>for</b> k variables. Concretely, the identities in n<k variables can be deduced by setting k−n variables to zero. The k-th Newton identity in n>k variables contains more terms {{on both sides of the}} equation than the one in k variables, but its validity will be assured if the coefficients of any monomial match. Because no individual monomial involves more than k of the variables, the monomial will survive the substitution of zero for some set of n−k (other) variables, after which the equality of coefficients is one that arises in the k-th Newton identity in k (suitably chosen) variables.|$|E
