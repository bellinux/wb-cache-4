The present study was attempted to identify the effective mating partners and assign probable heterotic groups by estimating the genetic variation among the experimental materials. In order to evaluate the genetic diversity of 49 sunflower promising inbred lines, selected morphological features as well as oil percentage were precisely investigated. Sunflower stocks including 18 R-lines and 31 B-lines were planted based on a simple lattice (7 × 7) design with two replications. Relationships among (i) quantitative and quantitative; (ii) qualitative and quantitative; and (iii) qualitative and qualitative traits were estimated by correlation analysis, ANOVA and chi square test, respectively. Results of ANOVA revealed significant differences (P< 0. 01) between the lines for most of the characters. A considerable outcome appeared when negative correlation between oil percentage and seed weight was achieved. Classification of lines based on cluster analysis separated them into two distinct groups of male and female. These achievements were confirmed by plot analysis based on the first two principal components. Moreover, the results of factor analysis indicated that four factors could explain 73. 92 % of the total variance. To sum up, the high genetic diversity that was demonstrated among 49 sunflower inbred promising lines suggested that selection of parents for hybridization needed to be based on genetic diversity.

The secret to the well being of oil palm as well as it productivity and sustainability of industry is undoubtedly due to good fertilizer and nutrition management. Through years of decades, good fertilizer and nutrition management of oil palm have become the priority and are continuously applied in all oil palm plantations throughout the world. Fertilizer that consists of organic and inorganic types is one of the good agricultural practices as it helps to improve fertility of soil and provides nutrient to the oil palm tree. However, the application of both types' fertilizers sometimes can increase the cost, lead to pollution and reduce the effective and efficiency of fertilizer application. This paper analyzed the comparison of growth and productivity of oil palm based on application of both fertilizer, and the effectiveness of each fertilizer. Reviews for a few parameters such as soil chemical properties, leaf nutrient, plant height were also included to support the prove. Results show that organic fertilizer is better for growth of oil palm seedling while inorganic fertilizer is more suitable in providing nutrient for oil palm's productivity.

Therefore, increasing our understanding of lipid accumulation in oilseed rape seeds is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionisation - mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MADLI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major lipid species, triacylglycerols (TAGs) and phosphatidylcholines (PCs). A dramatic, heterogeneous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different lipid compositions between the various seed tissues. The embryonic axis was particularly enriched in lipid species containing palmitate, while the seed coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the lipid composition of {{the inner and outer}} cotyledons differed to each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. TAG and PC molecular species distribution was analysed through a developmental time series covering early seed lipid accumulation to the end of lipid accumulation. The spatial patterning of lipid molecular species did not vary much during seed development, although there were exceptions. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected seeds. The distinct lipid distribution profiles observed implies differential {{regulation of}} lipid metabolism between the different seed tissues.

In environmental aspects, it is require to increase energy independence and produce employment are inspiring the countries around the whole world in support of biofuels research, invention and production. Biodiesel production is an important method which requires a sustained study and optimization process because of its advantageous ecological aspects and its renewable nature. Biodiesel fuel is clean burning diesel alternative and has several attractive characteristics including biodegradability, renewability, low emission and non toxic. The main objectives of this study to produce biodiesel from Rice Bran Oil (RBO) by transesterification (alcoholysis) process and investigated the performance parameters of single cylinder four stroke diesel engines operating on Rice Bran Oil (RBO) & Rice Bran Oil Methyl Ester (RBOME) blends. Biodiesel is an alternative fuel to the broadly used petroleum-diesel fuel. Biodiesel can be produced by domestic and non-domestic sources such as Rice Bran Oil, Soybeans, Karanja, Cotton seeds, Coconuts, Jatropha, Rubber seed, Ratanjot Oil, Rapeseeds oil etc. and thus these reduces dependence on retreating petroleum fuel from distant sources. The main reason of the transesterification process is to decrease the viscosity of oil.

The world's fossil fuel and crude oil reserves are going to dry up in the next few decades, but, contrariwise, an attractive, high quality, readily available and economically extractable oil from microalgae is a substitute feedstock to produce alternative biodiesel fuel for the transportation sector in the future. Microalgae have a higher biomass productivity (tons/hectare/year) and lipid yield (kg/kg of algal biomass) as compared to <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> <b>crops.</b> To overcome the problem of energy deficiency in developing countries, like Pakistan, and boost their economic growth, alternative fuels are proving very important for environment-friendly and sustainable development, especially in the last few decades. Different research studies on microalgae cultivation, characterization of microalgae oil (lipids), and evaluations of its socio-economic feasibility to produce renewable biodiesel have been conducted in the past in Pakistan for its future prospects. This review paper includes the overall summary and compilation of the microalgae research conducted in Pakistan on biodiesel production and includes the algal biodiesel production cost analysis. The studies showed promising results for harnessing microalgae and using its lipids to produce biodiesel with favourable properties that were comparable to the conventional diesel in Pakistan. The information related to the microalgae research will help stakeholders and governmental organisations working in the renewable energy sector to consider its cultivation on a large scale, using waste water as a feedstock to produce biodiesel to meet the target set by the Government of Pakistan of using 10 % blended biodiesel by the year 2025 in Pakistan...|$|E

Each helitron contained an average of 2. 9 gene fragments and 1. 9 intact genes, of which the majority were annotated with binding functions in metabolic processes. In addition, a set of 114 nonredundant microRNAs were detected within 174 helitrons and predicted to regulate a set of 787 nonredundant target genes.

In this review, we present an overview of the available data on yield-determining, yield-limiting, and yield-reducing factors in oil palm; the effects of these factors on yield, as measured in case studies or calculated using computer models; and the underlying plant-physiological mechanisms. We distinguish four production levels: the potential, water-limited, nutrient-limited, and the actual yield. The potential yield over a plantation lifetime is determined by incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), temperature, atmospheric CO 2 concentration and planting material, assuming optimum plantation establishment, planting density (120 – 150 palms per hectares), canopy management (30 – 60 leaves depending on palm age), pollination, and harvesting. Water-limited yields in environments with water deficits > 400 mm year− 1 can be less than one-third of the potential yield, depending on additional factors such as temperature, wind speed, soil texture, and soil depth. Nutrient-limited yields of less than 50 % of the potential yield have been recorded when nitrogen or potassium were not applied. Actual yields are influenced by yield-reducing factors such as unsuitable ground vegetation, pests, and diseases, and may be close to zero in case of severe infestations. Smallholders face particular constraints such as the use of counterfeit seed and insufficient fertiliser application. Closing yield gaps in existing plantations could increase global production by 15 – 20 Mt oil yr− 1, which would limit the drive for further area expansion at a global scale. To increase yields in existing and future plantations in a sustainable way, all production factors mentioned need to be understood and addressed. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|Non-renewable energy use, {{greenhouse}} gas emissions and land use of two biobased products and biofuel from <b>oil</b> <b>crops</b> is investigated and compared with products from sugar crops. In a bio-based economy chemicals, materials and energy carriers will be produced from biomass. Next to side streams, also <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> and sugars are expected to become important resources for these products. Application of these resources calls for effective resource use, with minimal environmental impacts. In this paper we study a number of available options and their trade-offs. Use of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> in a chemical and a resin results in a higher reduction of non- renewable energy use and {{greenhouse gas}} emissions than their use as biodiesel. Furthermore, similar savings in environmental impact per unit of land {{can be reached by}} products from either <b>oil</b> or sugar <b>crops</b> as transportation fuel, but the sugar crops, applied in chemicals or bioplastics outcompete the <b>oil</b> <b>crops.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{closely related}} species Brassica rapa and B. oleracea {{encompass}} {{a wide range of}} <b>vegetable,</b> fodder and <b>oil</b> <b>crops.</b> The release of their reference genomes has facilitated resequencing collections of B. rapa and B. oleracea aiming to build their variome datasets. These data can be used to investigate the evolutionary relationships between and within the different species and the domestication of the crops, hereafter named morphotypes. These data can also be used in genetic studies aiming at the identification of genes that influence agronomic traits. We selected and resequenced 199 B. rapa and 119 B. oleracea accessions representing 12 and nine morphotypes, respectively. Based on these resequencing data, we obtained 2, 249, 473 and 3, 852, 169 high quality SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms), as well as 303, 617 and 417, 004 InDels for the B. rapa and B. oleracea populations, respectively. The variome datasets of B. rapa and B. oleracea represent valuable resources to researchers working on evolution, domestication or breeding of Brassica vegetable crops. </p...|$|R
40|$|Soybean (Glycine max L.) is an {{important}} source of protein for human and animal nutrition, as well as a major source of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil.</b> The soybean <b>crop</b> requires adequate water all through its growth period to attain its yield potential, and the lack of soil moisture at critical stages of growth profoundly impacts the productivity. In this study, utilizing (1) H NMR-based metabolite analysis combined with the physiological studies we assessed the effects of short-term water stress on overall growth, nitrogen fixation, ureide and proline dynamics, as well as metabolic changes in drought tolerant (NA 5009 RG) and sensitive (DM 50048) genotypes of soybean in order to elucidate metabolite adjustments in relation to the physiological responses in the nitrogen-fixing plants towards water limitation. The results of our analysis demonstrated critical differences in physiological responses between these two genotypes, and identified the metabolic pathways that are affected by short-term water limitation in soybean plants. Metabolic changes in response to drought conditions highlighted pools of metabolites that {{play a role in the}} adjustment of metabolism and physiology of the soybean varieties to meet drought effects...|$|R
