25|$|In 1994, Falwell {{promoted}} {{and distributed}} the video documentary The Clinton Chronicles: An Investigation into the Alleged Criminal Activities of Bill Clinton. The video purported to connect Bill Clinton to a murder conspiracy involving <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster,</b> James McDougall, Ron Brown, and a cocaine-smuggling operation. The theory was discredited, but nonetheless {{sold more than}} 150,000 copies.|$|E
25|$|With Scaife as publisher, {{the small}} {{circulation}} newspaper {{was the chief}} packager of editorials and news columns claiming that then United States President Bill Clinton or his wife, then First Lady Hillary Clinton {{were responsible for the}} death of Deputy White House counsel <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster.</b> Scaife paid freelancer Christopher Ruddy to write about the Foster case for the Tribune-Review and other right-leaning media. Special Prosecutor Ken Starr, appointed to investigate Clinton, concluded Foster had, in fact, committed suicide.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "Whitewater" [...] is {{sometimes}} used to include other controversies from the Bill Clinton administration, especially Travelgate, Filegate, {{and the circumstances}} surrounding <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster's</b> death, that were also investigated by the Whitewater Independent Counsel.|$|R
50|$|The case {{concerned}} {{the efforts of}} Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr {{to gain access to}} notes taken by Deputy White House Counsel <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster's</b> attorney, James Hamilton, during a conversation with Foster regarding the White House travel office controversy shortly before Foster's suicide.|$|R
5000|$|... 5. After {{a three-year}} investigation, Whitewater {{independent}} counsel Ken Starrreleased {{a report on}} October 10, 1997, also concluding that the death was a suicide. In response, Sheila <b>Foster</b> Anthony, <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster's</b> sister, said she agreed with Starr's findings but criticized his investigation for having taken so long, thus contributing {{to the existence of}} [...] "ridiculous conspiracy theories proffered by those with a profit or political motive".|$|R
25|$|The project {{not only}} accused Clinton of {{financial}} and sexual indiscretions (some later verified, others not), but also gave root to conspiracist notions that the Clintons {{collaborated with the}} CIA to run a drug smuggling operation out {{of the town of}} Mena, Arkansas and that Clinton had arranged for the murder of White House aide <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster</b> as part of a coverup of the Whitewater scandal. The possibility that money from the project had been given to former Clinton associate David Hale, a witness in the Whitewater investigation, led to the appointment of Michael J. Shaheen as a special investigator. Shaheen subpoenaed Scaife, who testified before a federal grand jury in the matter.|$|E
25|$|Starr {{served as}} a federal Court of Appeals judge and as {{solicitor}} general for George H. W. Bush. He received the most publicity for his tenure as independent counsel while Bill Clinton was U.S.president. Starr was initially appointed to investigate the suicide death of deputy White House counsel <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster</b> and the Whitewater real estate investments of Bill Clinton. The three-judge panel charged with administering the Independent Counsel Act later expanded the inquiry into numerous areas including an extramarital affair that Bill Clinton had with Monica Lewinsky. After several years of investigation, Starr filed the Starr Report, which alleged that Bill Clinton lied {{about the existence of}} the affair during a sworn deposition. The allegation lead to the impeachment of Bill Clinton and the five-year suspension of Clinton's law license.|$|E

For the first time, it tells how the FBI caught spy Robert Hanssen in its midst and how secret teams of FBI agents break into homes, offices, and embassies to plant bugging devices without getting caught and shot as burglars.|$|R
500|$|Almost {{two years}} passed. [...] Independent Counsel Starr {{continued}} his investigation. [...] Starr wanted access to notes that <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster's</b> attorney {{took in a}} conversation with Foster about the travel office affair shortly before Foster's suicide, but on June 25, 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6–3 against Starr in Swidler & Berlin v. United States, stating that attorney–client privilege extends beyond the grave. [...] In September 1998 Independent Counsel Starr released the famous Starr Report, concerning offenses that may have been committed by President Clinton as part of the Lewinsky scandal. [...] It did not mention the travel office matter.|$|R
5000|$|The Senator Al D'Amato-chaired Senate Special Whitewater Committee, {{which had}} begun the {{previous}} year, issued its findings in a majority report on June 18, 1996; it did not investigate Travelgate directly, but did say that [...] "Hillary Clinton, upon learning of <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster's</b> death, at least realized its connection to the Travelgate scandal, and perhaps to the Whitewater matter, and dispatched her trusted lieutenants to contain any potential embarrassment or political damage." [...] Minority Democratic members of the Committee derided these findings as [...] "a legislative travesty," [...] "a witch hunt," [...] and [...] "a political game." ...|$|R
500|$|Attention {{initially}} {{focused on}} the role of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), since on May 12, 1993, a week before the firings, associate White House counsel William Kennedy had requested that the FBI look into possible improprieties in the Travel Office operation. FBI agents went there and, although initially reluctant, authorized a preliminary investigation. [...] Deputy White House Counsel <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster</b> became worried about the firings about to take place and ordered the KPMG Peat Marwick review, asking the FBI to hold off in the meantime. [...] The accounting review started on May 14 and the report was given to the White House on May 17. KPMG was unable to do an actual audit, because there were so few records in the Travel Office that could be audited and because the office did not use the double-entry bookkeeping system that audits are based upon. One KPMG representative later described the office as [...] "an ungodly mess in terms of records" [...] with ten years of material piled up in a closet. [...] When the review came back with its reports of irregularities, Watkins went ahead with the terminations on May 19.|$|E
500|$|On January 5, 1996, a new {{development}} thrust the travel office matter again to the forefront. A two-year-old memo from White House director of administration David Watkins surfaced that identified First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton as the motivating force behind the firings, with the additional involvement of <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster</b> and Harry Thomason. [...] "Foster regularly informed me that the First Lady was concerned and desired action. The action desired was the firing of the Travel Office staff." [...] Written in fall 1993, apparently intended for McLarty, the Watkins memo also said [...] "we both know {{that there would be}} hell to pay" [...] if [...] "we failed to take swift and decisive action in conformity with the First Lady's wishes." [...] This memo contradicted the First Lady's previous statements in the GAO investigation, that she had played no role in the firings and had not consulted with Thomason beforehand; the White House also found it difficult to explain why the memo was so late in surfacing when all the previous investigations had requested all relevant materials. [...] House committee chair Clinger charged a cover-up was taking place and vowed to pursue new material.|$|E
2500|$|Burton said, in 1998 of Bill Clinton, [...] "If I {{could prove}} 10 {{percent of what}} I believe {{happened}} , he'd be gone. This guy's a scumbag. That's why I'm after him." [...] Burton led the House inquiry into the death of <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster,</b> who he believed was murdered and urged extensive investigation into the possible involvement of the Clintons. Burton gained attention for re-enacting the alleged crime in his backyard with his own pistol and a watermelon standing in for Foster's head. After hearings into Democratic fundraising (see section below) began, a Democratic National Committee staffer appeared in a pumpkin suit with a button that read, [...] "Don't shoot." [...] Burton's information during the Whitewater controversy was based on opposition research conducted by Floyd Brown, who founded Citizens United in 1988. Due to problems {{with the quality of}} Brown's research and testimony, the investigation was closed.|$|E
500|$|The {{travel office}} {{controversy}} was subsequently judged {{to have been}} a factor in <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster's</b> depression and July 20, 1993, suicide. [...] In his torn-up resignation note from a few days before, he wrote [...] "No one in The White House, to my knowledge, violated any law or standard of conduct, including any action in the Travel Office. There was no intent to benefit any individual or specific group. [...] The press is covering up the illegal benefits they received from the travel staff". [...] (In the last part, Foster may have been referring to lax customs treatment by the Travel Office of goods brought back from foreign trips by reporters.) ...|$|R
5000|$|In March 2017, Trump {{criticized the}} Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, after the 2017 Westminster attack, {{which in turn}} led British lawmakers to criticize Trump Jr. British journalists said that Trump Jr. had quoted Khan out of context when he criticized him. [...] Khan {{did not respond to}} the criticism, saying he had [...] "far more {{important}} things" [...] to do. In April 2017, he lauded Mike Cernovich who promoted the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory, saying, [...] "In a long gone time of unbiased journalism he'd win the Pulitzer". In May 2017, Trump promoted the [...] "long-debunked, far-right conspiracy theory" [...] that Bill Clinton was linked to <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster's</b> death.|$|R

2500|$|On October 10, 1997, Starr's {{report on}} the death of deputy White House counsel <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster,</b> drafted largely by Starr's deputy Brett Kavanaugh, was {{released}} to the public by the Special Division. The complete report is 137 pages long and includes the appendix added to the Report by the Special Division over the objection of Kenneth Starr. [...] The report agrees with the findings of previous independent counsel Robert B. Fiske that Foster committed suicide at Fort Marcy Park, in Virginia, and that his suicide was caused primarily by undiagnosed and untreated depression. As CNN explained on February 28, 1997, [...] "The [...] report refutes claims by conservative political organizations that Foster was the victim of a murder plot and coverup," [...] but [...] "despite those findings, right-wing political groups have continued to allege that there was more to the death and that {{the president and first lady}} tried to cover it up." [...] CNN also noted that organizations pushing the murder theory included the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, owned by billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife, and Accuracy in Media, supported in part by Scaife's foundation. Scaife's reporter on the Whitewater matter, Christopher Ruddy, was a frequent critic of Starr's handling of the case.|$|E

In 1992 Mathews joined Bill Clinton's presidential campaign and led the economic team for the president-elect. Following Clinton's inauguration, Mathews, with Robert Rubin, helped set up the National Economic Council (NEC). She served as Staff Director of the NEC from 1993 to 1995. While Mathews was at NEC, the White House pushed for healthcare reform. Mathews was among those in the administration who advocated for finding ways, apart from legislation, to curb healthcare costs. When Rubin became Secretary of the Treasury in 1995, Mathews became his Chief of Staff. She testified before a Senate Committee during the Whitewater investigations regarding her search of <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster's</b> garbage {{and the fate of}} the documents she discovered. Mathews told the committee she had been looking for an indication as to why Foster had committed suicide and denied ordering any documents destroyed.|$|R

5000|$|Vincent was a {{childhood}} friend of Bill Clinton (a {{year and a half}} his junior), who as Billy Blythe resided in an adjoining property to Foster's with his grandparents while his mother was often away studying nursing. [...] As Clinton later recalled, [...] "I lived with my grandparents in a modest little house across from <b>Vince</b> <b>Foster's</b> nice, big, white brick house." [...] Another Clinton recollection was that Foster [...] "was kind to me and never lorded it over me the way so many older boys did with younger ones." [...] Another childhood friend was Mack McLarty, who would one day become White House Chief of Staff for Clinton. [...] In 1950 Clinton's mother remarried and they moved to a different part of Hope. [...] By several accounts Foster and Clinton attended Miss Marie Purkins' School for Little Folks, a private kindergarten, together, although Foster was a year ahead in school. Then around late 1952 the Clintons moved away to Hot Springs. [...] However Clinton would often return to visit his grandparents in Hope during summers, weekends, and holidays after that, and he maintained connections with the people there.|$|R
