The discharge relation for these devices cannot be solved directly, {{but it needs}} iteration process {{to account for the}} approach velocity head. In this paper, analytical solution was developed to calculate the discharge in a combined critical depth-meter namely, a hump combined with lateral contraction in rectangular channel with subcritical approach flow including energy losses. Also analytical formulae were derived for approach <b>velocity</b> <b>head</b> <b>coefficient</b> for different types of critical depth meters. The solution was derived by solving a standard cubic equation considering energy loss on the base of trigonometric identity. The advantage of this technique is to avoid iteration process adopted in measuring flow by these devices. Numerical examples are chosen for demonstration of the proposed solution...|$|E
40|$|The design {{arrangement}} of the Experimental Gas Cooled Reactor contains six fuel assemblies stacked vertically, above one another, in each of 232 vertical fuel channels in the graphite core. Each stack of six fuel assemblies is preceded and followed by a dummy assembly. The upper dummy assembly contains a reflector plug and a latch mechanism. The lower dummy assembly contains an orifice with an adjustable plunger capable of varying reactor coolant flow through the orifice. The pressure drop characteristics of the dummy assemblies for eight different throttling positions were obtained in the test program at near atmospheric pressure using an air flow corresponding to Reynolds Numbers of 12, 000 to 60, 000 in the fuel element assemblies.

The benefit of a PKW is an increased discharge capacity, and hence lower free surface heads at the upstream reservoir. During the last years several experimental and numerical research investigations were carried out to analyze discharge coefficients for various PKW types. Therefore, numerical 3 D CFD codes and small-scaled experimental models were used. To identify discharge coefficients the Poleni formula can be used. By measuring the total discharge and the weir <b>head,</b> discharge <b>coefficients</b> can be calculated. But results will be sensitive due to the weir head, because basically the total energy <b>head</b> includes the <b>velocity</b> <b>head.</b> Hence, the position of the measuring point for the weir head and the associated <b>velocity</b> <b>head</b> must be selected carefully.

50|$|The {{pressure}} of a fluid is different when it flows {{than when it}} is not flowing. This is why static pressure and dynamic pressure are never the same in a system in which the fluid is in motion. This pressure difference arises from a change in fluid velocity that produces <b>velocity</b> <b>head,</b> which is a term of the Bernoulli equation that is zero when there is no bulk motion of the fluid. In the picture on the right, the pressure differential is entirely due to the change in <b>velocity</b> <b>head</b> of the fluid, but it can be measured as a pressure head because of the Bernoulli principle.

40|$|Wave run-up on {{foundations}} {{is a very}} important factor in the design of entrance platforms for offshore wind turbines. When the Horns Reef 1 wind turbine park in Denmark was designed the vertical wave run-up phenomenon was not well known in the. industry, hence not sufficiently considered in the design of Horns Reef 1. As a consequence damage was observed on the platforms. This has been the situation for several sites and design tools for platform loads are lacking. As a consequence a physical model test study was initiated at Aalborg University to clarify wave run-up on cylindrical piles for different values of diameter to water depth ratios (D/h) and different wave heights to water depth ratios (H/h) for both regular and irregular waves. A calculation model is calibrated based on stream function theory for crest kinematics and <b>velocity</b> <b>head</b> stagnation theory. Due to increased velocities close to the pile an empirical factor is included on the <b>velocity</b> <b>head.</b> The evaluation of the calculation model shows that an accurate design rule can be established even in breaking wave conditions.

The test program consisted of 8 series of individual tests with each series giving data for flow rates for each series ranging from 150 gpm to either 1200 gpm or 1500 gpm depending upon the series. The analyses of data to determine the friction factors head losses in both the 6 -inch and 4 -inch PERMASTRAN® pipe indicate that the values fall on a hydraulically smooth curve of the Moody diagram for the range of Reynolds numbers tested. The same friction factors exist for the PVC pipe used in the tests because each has the same polyvinylchloride inside wall material. Head losses for these 6 -inch and 4 -inch pipes over a range of Reynolds numbers are given in Table 8. The <b>coefficient</b> of <b>head</b> loss due to the 6 -inch RING-TITE filament-wound 90 ° elbow equals 0. 5 and this value is constant over the range of Reynolds numbers of the tests. The average <b>coefficient</b> of <b>head</b> loss caused by the 6 x 6 x 6 -inch RING-TITE filament-wound tee when operating as a 90 ° elbow (i. e. with the pipe in one “straight through” branch plugged) equal 1. 5 with slightly larger values at smaller Reynolds numbers. The average <b>coefficient</b> of <b>head</b> loss caused by the 6 x 6 x 4 -inch RING-TITE filament-wound tee when operating in this same mode (flow leaving through 4 -inch branch) equals 1. 6 when based on the <b>velocity</b> <b>head</b> in the 4 -inch pipe and 6. 9 when based on the <b>velocity</b> <b>head</b> in the 6 -inch pipe. The head losses in the 6 x 6 x 6 -inch tee were also measured with the tee operating to separate the flow coming {{into one of the}} “straight through” branches into two outflows. The <b>head</b> loss <b>coefficients</b> which measure the head loss between the two “straight through” branches plot against Reynolds number as a straight line on log-log paper.

40|$|A {{higher order}} {{cavitation}} oscillation {{observed in the}} SSME low pressure fuel pump has been eliminated in water flow testing of a modified subscale replica of the inducer. The low pressure pump was modified by removing the outboard sections of two opposing blades of the four-bladed inducer, blending the "cutback" regions into the blades {{at the leading edge}} and tip, and removing material on the suction sides to decrease the exposed leading edge thickness. The leading edge tips of the cutback blades were moved approximately 25 degrees from their previous locations, thereby increasing one blade to blade spacing, decreasing the second, while simultaneously moving the cutback tips downstream. The test was conducted in MSFC's inducer test loop at scaled operating conditions in degassed and filtered water. In addition to eliminating HOC across the entire scaled operating regime, rotating cavitation was suppressed while the range of both alternate blade and asymmetric cavitation were increased. These latter phenomena, and more significantly, the shifts between these cavitation modes also resulted in significant changes to the <b>head</b> <b>coefficient</b> at low cavitation numbers. Reverse flow was detected at a slightly larger flow coefficient with the cutback inducer and suction capability was reduced by approximately 1 <b>velocity</b> <b>head</b> at and above approximately 90 % of the reference flow coefficient. These performance changes along with more intense reverse flow are consistent with poor flow area management and increased incidence in the cutback region.

This paper provides a framework for assessing whether the variability in the hydraulic parameters could lead to significant differences in the performance of rolls of drip irrigation laterals from the same manufacturing batch. A system approach with inlet pressure as input, pressure distribution along the drip lateral and inlet discharge as outputs (or responses), and a drip lateral hydraulic model as the transfer function is explored. Within a Bayesian statistical framework of parameter uncertainty based on the Metropolis algorithm, the hydraulic parameters of pressure-compensating drip lateral rolls from the same manufacturing batch were inferred (calibrated). Overlapping of the space (region) of the hydraulic parameters of different drip laterals give an indication of compatibility (similarity) of the drip laterals. Results indicated that half of the drip lateral rolls tested were strongly compatible, a third were weakly compatible, and the remainder were not compatible with any other. This finding has significant ramifications in the design of drip irrigation lateral networks.
