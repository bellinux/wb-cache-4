40|$|The {{performance}} of vertical centrifugal slurry pump {{is quite different}} from clear water pump due to presence of solid particles in water. An approach to derive the performance behaviour of a <b>vertical</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pump</b> used for transporting dredged slurry based on detail hydraulic loss analysis has been presented in this paper. The derived analytical data has been compared with experimental results. Performance analysis of a vertical submersible centrifugal slurry pump has been accomplished in two stages. At first, performance characteristics of the centrifugal pump with clear water have been investigated considering an indepth hydraulic loss analysis. Depending on the particle size distribution, the effect of solid particles on the performance characteristics of centrifugal slurry pump has been investigated considering volume fraction of particle size. The homogenous slurry with fine particles has been treated as Newtonian fluid with slurry viscosity and specific gravity. Additional hydraulic losses due to coarse solid particle have been considered for coarse slurry fraction. The {{performance of}} the vertical centrifugal slurry pump has been predicted with the accuracies of about 87 % and 90 % for respective solid concentration of 18 % and 10 % by volume near the maximum efficiency point. The drooping performance characteristics at low flow operation have been found deteriorating further with the increase of solid concentration...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 18 It is well {{documented}} that the proper operation of <b>vertical</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pumps</b> is greatly dependent upon the entire pump/piping system, which includes the piping geometry and the system operating conditions. Oftentimes, pump operate satisfactorily during shop tests but experience problems after they are installed in the field. Here, three large vertical pumps that operated satisfactorily on the test stand experienced excessive vibration after installation. Additionally, pulsation in the system piping {{was found to be}} causing unexpected vibration in downstream equipment. It was discovered that the problems were the result of complex interaction between several phenomena. Improper inlet conditions caused suction recirculation that generated broadband turbulence. The turbulent energy excited acoustical resonances of the pump/piping system, resulting in pulsation at several discrete frequencies. This energy subsequently excited mechanical natural frequencies of the motor/pump/piping system causing high amplitude nonsynchronous vibration of the pump and other structurers far downstream from the pump. Field data are presented. Diagnostic techniques and instrumentation needed to obtain the field data required to solve these problems are discussed. Also, additional data from pump hydraulic analysis and sump model tests are presented. Further, the solution strategy with two-step field changes (sump and pump) is shown.

40|$|The Savannah River Site (SRS) is in {{the process}} of {{removing}} waste (sludge and salt cake) from million gallon waste tanks. The current practice for removing waste from the tanks is adding water, agitating the tanks with long shaft <b>vertical</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pumps,</b> and pumping the sludge/salt solution from the tank to downstream treatment processes. This practice has left sludge heels ({tilde} 30, 000 gallons) in the bottom of the tanks. SRS is evaluating shrouded axial impeller mixers for removing the sludge heels in the waste tanks. The authors conducted a test program to determine mixer requirements for suspending sludge heels using the shrouded axial impeller mixers. The tests were performed with zeolite in scaled tanks which have diameters of 1. 5, 6. 0, and 18. 75 feet. The mixer speeds required to suspend zeolite particles were measured at each scale. The data were analyzed with various scaling methods to compare their ability to describe the suspension of insoluble solids with the mixers and to apply the data to a full-scale waste tank. The impact of changes in particle properties and operating parameters was also evaluated. The conclusions of the work are: Scaling of the suspension of fast settling zeolite particles was best described by the constant power per unit volume method. Increasing the zeolite particle concentration increased the required mixer power needed to suspend the particles. Decreasing the zeolite particle size from 0. 7 mm � 0. 3 mm decreased the required mixer power needed to suspend the particles. Increasing the number of mixers in the tank decreased the required mixer power needed to suspend the particles. A velocity of 1. 6 ft/sec two inches above the tank bottom is needed to suspend zeolite particles...|$|R

However, nonsynchronous phenomenon such as recirculation, stage-stall, and shaft instabilities can also cause vibration problems.
