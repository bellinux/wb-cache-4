40|$|In the {{treatment}} of dystonia patients, we give a muscle afferent block (MAB), an intramuscular injection of lidocaine plus one tenth the volume of ethanol, to reduce abnormal hypercontraction of the relevant muscles. In this study we investigate {{the role of the}} proximal muscles in the pathophysiology of writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp.</b> Five idiopathic writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp</b> patients were studied. MAB treatment targetting the forearm muscles was unsuccessful in all cases. All patients showed more improvement when they were given extra MAB injections into the proximal muscles. Two cases in particular benefitted just after proximal injections only. Our results show proximal muscles can be responsible for writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp.</b> We assume dystonia to be an abnormality in 2 ̆ 7 motor subroutine 2 ̆ 7; in accordance with certain repeated movements some motor loops can be formed between the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia and problems within these loops can cause dystonia.

40|$|Patients with writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp</b> present sensory and {{representational}} abnormalities {{relevant to}} motor control, such as impairment in the temporal discrimination between tactile stimuli and in pure motor imagery tasks, like the mental rotation of corporeal and inanimate objects. However, only limited {{information is available}} on the ability of patients with dystonia to process the time-dependent features (e. g. speed) of movement in real time. The processing of time-dependent features of movement has a crucial role in predicting whether the outcome of a complex motor sequence, such as handwriting or playing a musical passage, will be consistent with its ultimate goal, or results instead in an execution error. In this study, we sought to evaluate the implicit ability to perceive the temporal outcome of different movements in a group of patients with writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp.</b> Fourteen patients affected by writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp</b> in the right hand and 17 age-and gender-matched healthy subjects were recruited for the study. Subjects were asked to perform a temporal expectation task by predicting the end of visually perceived human body motion (handwriting, i. e. the action performed by the human body segment specifically affected by writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp)</b> or inanimate object motion (a moving circle reaching a spatial target). Videos representing movements were shown in full before experimental trials; the actual tasks consisted of watching the same videos, but interrupted after a variable interval (2 ̆ 7 pre-dark 2 ̆ 7) from its onset by a dark interval of variable duration. During the 2 ̆ 7 dark 2 ̆ 7 interval, subjects were asked to indicate when the movement represented in the video reached its end by clicking on the space bar of the keyboard. We also included a visual working memory task. Performance on the timing task was analysed measuring the absolute value of timing error, the coefficient of variability and the percentage of anticipation responses. Patients with writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp</b> exhibited greater absolute timing error compared with control subjects in the human body motion task (whereas no difference was observed in the inanimate object motion task). No effect of group was documented on the visual working memory tasks. Absolute timing error on the human body motion task did not significantly correlate with symptom severity, disease duration or writing speed. Our findings suggest an alteration of the writing movement representation at a central level and are consistent with the view that dystonia is not a purely motor disorder, but it also involves non-motor (sensory, cognitive) aspects related to movement processing and planning...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSensorimotor {{representations}} of movements are {{created in the}} sensorimotor network through repeated practice to support successful and effortless performance. Writer 3 <b>s</b> <b>cramp</b> (WC) is a disorder acquired through extensive practice of finger movements, {{and it is likely}} associated with the abnormal acquisition of sensorimotor representations. We investigated (i) the activation and connectivity changes in the brain network supporting the acquisition of sensorimotor {{representations of}} finger sequences in patients with WC and (ii) the link between these changes and consolidation of motor performance 24 h after the initial practice. Twenty-two patients with WC and 22 age-matched healthy volunteers practiced a complex sequence with the right (pathological) hand during functional MRI recording. Speed and accuracy were measured immediately before and after practice (day 1) and 24 h after practice (day 2). The two groups reached equivalent motor performance on day 1 and day 2. During motor practice, patients with WC had (i) reduced hippocampal activation and hippocampal–striatal functional connectivity; and (ii) overactivation of premotor–striatal areas, whose connectivity correlated with motor performance after consolidation. These results suggest that patients with WC use alternative networks to reach equiperformance in the acquisition of new motor memories...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ensuring {{adequate}} {{dietary intake}} during pregnancy {{has important implications}} for optimising maternal and fetal health. It is not known whether diet quality is altered over pregnancy and the post-partum period. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} perform a comprehensive assessment of diet quality in overweight and obese women during pregnancy and early post-partum. DESIGN: In a prospective cohort study, n= 301 overweight or obese pregnant women completed a food frequency questionnaire at study entry (10 – 20 weeks gestation), 28 weeks gestation, 36 weeks gestation and 4 months post-partum for assessment of macronutrient and micronutrient intake and diet quality by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI). RESULTS: Energy, macronutrient and dietary sources of micronutrients did not alter across pregnancy or post-partum. The HEI was of below average quality in 31. 0 % of women at baseline. This decreased from week 28 (P< 0. 001) and was maintained at a lower level post-partum such that HEI levels were lower compared with study entry (53. 3 ± 12. 7 versus 56. 7 ± 10. 1, P< 0. 001). The HEI decrease occurred in association with decreases in the milk, meat and unsaturated oil components, and increases in the proportion of energy from solid fats, alcohol and added sugars (P< 0. 001), and was independently predicted by the socioeconomic index for areas score (β=− 0. 011, s. e. = 0. 011, P= 0. 031). CONCLUSION: We report for the first time that dietary quality decreases across pregnancy and is maintained at this reduced level in the early post-partum period in overweight and obese women. Dietary interventions aimed at improving diet quality should be targeted to early pregnancy and post-partum. L. J. Moran, Z. Sui, C. <b>S.</b> <b>Cramp</b> and J. M. Dod...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of the violoncello as a solo instrument was recognized and supported by cellists such as Luigi Boccherini (1743 - 1805), Luis Duport (1749 - 1819), Auguste Franchomme (1808 - 1884), and Alfredo Piatti (1822 - 1901). These pioneers composed technically demanding etudes, exercises, and caprices for the cello that were comparable to those already present in the violin literature. Even so, {{in the late nineteenth}} century and early twentieth century, considerably fewer substantial works were brought forth for the cello as compared with the <b>violin.</b> Consequently, many <b>cellists</b> such as Luigi Silva (1903 - 1961), Gregor Piatigorsky (1903 - 1976), Pierre Fournier (1906 - 1986), and Janos Starker (b. 1924) selected notable pieces from the violin repertoire and transcribed these for the cello. Some composers themselves actually adapted for the cello their own works originally written for the violin. Johannes Brahms with his Violin Sonata Op. 78, Igor Stravinsky with his Suite Italienne, and Béla Bartók with his First Rhapsody all belong to this category. Adaptations such as these further raised awareness among composers and performers of the possibilities of the cello as an independent and expressive instrument. Thus, many composers from the early 1900 s to the present were encouraged to write increasing numbers of more soloistic and demanding works for cello. Herein, I explore the repertoire of cello transcriptions in order to analyze the differences between the original and transcribed versions and the challenges found therein. The performer may attempt to recreate the effect originally intended for the violin or, more daringly, may strive to search for alternate presentations of the music more suitable and expressive of the cello's own character.

40|$|Neutrophils {{are among}} the most {{important}} components of the innate immune response, which provides the first line of host defense. The antimicrobial potential of neutrophils has been traditionally divided into either non-oxidative or oxidative mechanisms. Two of the most important antimicrobial systems of these mechansims are granule-associated antimicrobial proteases and peptides and the nicotinamid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the past, studies often focused on the effects of either non-oxidative or oxidative mechanisms and decades of research have provided a detailed understanding of the regulation, generation and actions of these processes alone. Recent evidence challenged the established view of two independent mechanisms and proposed the cooperation of the NADPH oxidase with granule proteases in the killing of microorganisms. Furthermore, a novel phagocytosis-independent antimicrobial mechanism was found by the discovery of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The formation of NETs was found dependent on NADPH oxidase activation and the production of ROS but NETs are believed to kill entrapped pathogens by NETsassociated granule proteases and peptides. Consequently, NETs present additional evidence for the interaction of non-oxidative and oxidative killing mechanisms. Together, these findings opened a new field of investigation with many controversies to be elucidated and underscored that we need further insight into the mechanisms by which neutrophils specifically recognize and overcome pathogens. In this thesis, we followed the question whether the murine antimicrobial peptide cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) is {{an important component of the}} non-oxidative arm of neutrophil defense against S. aureus. This was motivated because little is known about cathelicidin function and activity in neutrophils and seems of crucial interest since mice lack the major constituent of human neutrophils - the -defensins. We further aimed to specify the relationship between the NADPH oxidase and CRAMP with focus on the antimicrobial activity of CRAMP in association with NETs and in NADPH oxidase-deficient mice (gp 91 phox-/-). As a result, we could demonstrate a previously unknown intracellular antimicrobial activity of <b>CRAMP</b> against <b>S.</b> aureus. Specifically, <b>CRAMP</b> colocalized with <b>S.</b> aureus in phagolysosomes and we showed first evidence for the presence of intracellular active CRAMP. Most interestingly, phagolysosomal localization and intracellular activity of CRAMP was found independent of a functional NADPH oxidase controversially to our expectations. Investigation of NET-dependent killing of S. aureus revealed a negligible role for CRAMP due to inactivation of the peptide in association with NETs. This point is of particular relevance and should be considered in the current opinion of NETs-mediated antimicrobial activity. In summary, our data provided deeper knowledge about one specific member of the non-oxidative killing mechanism and gives reason to reconsider the controversial results about interaction of NADPH oxidase in activating non-oxidative mechanisms. In addition, we followed the question whether recognition of S. aureus by TLR 2 regulates the induction of non-oxidative and oxidative killing responses as well as the induction of NETs. The background of this study is based on several previous reports. First, results of our group evidenced a relationship between TLR 2 -mediated staphylococcal killing by neutrophils and the susceptibility of S. aureus to cationic antimicrobial peptides. Additionally, TLR 2 activation has been shown to up-regulate 7 cathelicidin expression. Second, TLR 2 was demonstrated to induce phosphorylation of p 47 phox and up-regulation of p 47 phox mRNA in macrophages. However, little attention has been paid to similar studies in neutrophils. Third, recognition of pathogens by TLRs was hypothesized to induce formation of NETs but there is as yet no evidence. First results unraveled a role for TLR 2 in rapid induction of the NADPH oxidase, whereas TLR 2 signaling had no influence on CRAMP activity. Interestingly, pathogen sensing for the induction of NETs formation did not depend on TLR 2 - MyD 88 signaling. Taken together, the results demonstrate a role for TLR 2 in mediating rapid killing of S. aureus by accelerating the activation of the NADPH oxidase complex possibly by influencing assembly. Further studies of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between pathogen sensing and non-oxidative and oxidative killing mechanisms would contribute greatly to our understanding of how the innate immune system resolves bacterial infections and will help in the development of therapeutic strategies to assist in clearance of pathogenic bacteria...|$|R
40|$|The present deep Western Boundary Undercurrent (WBUC) at the Eirik Drift off the {{southern}} tip of Greenland is mainly fed by the overflows over the Greenland-Scotland ridge (GSR), the Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW) and Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW), respectively (Fig. 1). Interactions of the atmosphere with the warm and saline Atlantic surface inflow to the Norwegian-Greenland Sea (NGS) yield in convective mixing and the production of these dense overflow water masses (Van Aken, 2007). Therefore, the WBUC at the Eirik Drift is sensitive to changes in the deep-water formation and hence, to climate changes. Changes in the WBUC will, in turn, affect the world's climate. The WBUC is the main contributor to the lower branch of the North Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation (THC). The upper counterpart of the THC is responsible for the global redistribution of heat and freshwater via the surface ocean. The Eirik Drift has been shaped by the WBUC since the Miocene. It therefore archives information of changes in depositional processes and hence, changes in the pathways and strength of the WBUC. The high-resolution multichannel seismic reflection data network collected during RV Maria S. Merian cruise MSM 12 / 2 crossed ODP Leg 105 Site 646 and IODP Expedition 303 Sites U 1305, U 1306, and U 1307 (Fig. 1). Thus, the seismic reflection data could be incorporated with geological information from the ODP and IODP sites (Channell et al., 2010; Srivastava et al., 1989) to deduce information {{on the development of the}} WBUC and a much clearer understanding of the evolution of the climate in the northern North Atlantic during the Neogene. Synthetic seismograms based on density and P-wave velocity data from ODP Leg 105 Site 646 and IODP Expedition 303 Sites U 1305, U 1306, and U 1307 were correlated with the processed seismic reflection data. We identified four seismic units and the reflectors defined by Arthur et al. (1989) and refined the stratigraphy by horizons A 1 (0. 8 Ma), A 2 (1. 4 Ma) and A 3 (19 - 17 Ma) (Table 1). We tracked the reflectors and seismic units from ODP Leg 105 Site 646 over our complete study area. The erosional and depositional centers of each (sub) unit were interpreted with respect to the prevailing deep current activity. The shapes and locations of the depocenters of the seismic (sub) units as well as the internal structure and reflection characteristics are used to decipher the changes in the WBUC's pathways and intensity in the study area. In sediment drifts deposited under the influence of along-slope processes, unit thinning, converging internal reflections and reflector truncations indicate the erosional centers of deep current cores. In the Northern Hemisphere, the depocenters with diverging internal reflections are found to the right of the deep current flow (Faugères et al., 2008; Faugères et al., 1999; Nielsen et al., 2008). The location and orientation of the depocenters as well as the morphology of the basal horizons help to connect the erosional centers to pathways over the study area as contour currents follow certain depth ranges. We observe shifts in the location and orientation of the depocenters and crest migrations among the seismic subunits. This indicates a highly variable deep current activity at the Eirik Drift. The interpretation of our data leads to a model of the paleocirculation at the Eirik Drift with pathways and intensity of the WBUC. Here, the observations in every (sub) unit and their interpretations are discussed with respect to the evolution of deep currents, shifts in deep water formation regions and climate changes in the northern North Atlantic. The various depocenters of subunit SUIV-c (40 - 19 Ma; Table 1) are interpreted as an infill and drape of the hummocky basement (60 - 40 Ma) in a tranquil environment at the Eirik Drift (Mueller-Michaelis et al., 2012 (submitted)). Not surprisingly, no WBUC is observed at the Eirik Drift as the GSR has not reached the critical level to allow NCW overflow until early Miocene (Vogt, 1972). But still there is an indication for existing NCW deep circulation in the NE North Atlantic within this time interval observed with a major increase in drift accumulation at the Feni Drift (Wold, 1994) (35 - 33 Ma; Fig. 1). This NCW flow is found southward directed from the Rockall Trough to the North Atlantic (Fig. 2 a). Two possible deep-water formation regions have been hypothesized to be responsible for that: South of the GSR in the Rockall Trough (Stoker, 1998) or north of the sill in the SE Norwegian Sea with an open gateway at the distal eastern end of the GSR via the Faroe-Shetland basin (Davies et al., 2001). Indications for the latter are also documented in the Faroe Drift NE of the GSR (Davies et al., 2001) and therefore seems more likely than the Rockall Trough theory. We observe the onset of WBUC activity at 19 Ma at the Eirik Drift. A widespread erosional event in the North Atlantic in the early Miocene accounts also for the onset of drift building at horizon A 3 (19 - 17 Ma, Table 1) (Mueller-Michaelis et al., 2012 (submitted)). This event is also observed in Bjorn, Gardar and Feni Drifts (Fig. 1) (Miller and Tucholke, 1983). We suggest the deep-water formation region in the NGS and the onset of NCW overflows following the subsidence of the GSR in early Miocene (Vogt, 1972). The NCW flow remained intense at the Eirik Drift until 15 Ma, but was depleted between 15 - 12. 5 Ma (Mueller-Michaelis et al., 2012 (submitted)). This is in accordance to the general observation of low NCW flux between 16 to 12. 5 Ma (Woodruff and Savin, 1989; Wright et al., 1992). We suggest that the onset of the NCW overflows and intensification of the deep-water formation reinforced the Miocene warming phase with an intensified northward transport of warm and saline Atlantic surface water. Increased freshwater input to the Nordic Seas towards the mid Miocene Climatic Optimum may then have yielded in a strong, stable ocean stratification with a freshwater-barrier-layer, which inhibited deep convection in the Nordic Seas. The decrease in NCW formation, in turn, accounted for a decrease in northward heat transport to high latitudes and assisted the cooling of the mid Miocene Climate Transition (14 Ma). We expect this climate cooling to have resulted in increasing instability of the surface ocean stratification due to heat loss and salt input at the oceans surface. This yields a renewed NCW production and thus, a renewed onset of WBUC has been observed at 12. 5 Ma at the Eirik Drift with the formation of horizon R 5 (12 - 10 Ma; Table 1). The renewed NCW production is also documented in increased accumulation observed at Snorri, Bjorn, Gardar and Hatton Drift (Fig. 1) between 13 and 10 Ma (Wold, 1994). Between 10 and 8. 1 Ma we observe a shallower WBUC than between 19 and 15 Ma at the Eirik Drift. The shallower WBUC is interpreted as the result of less dense and thus, weaker NCW flow. With our knowledge of the present WBUC at the Eirik Drift, we would expect a strong WBUC along with higher NCW production and vice versa. Higher NCW production, in turn, is expected in a cool regime, as surface cooling and salt input due to formation of sea-ice increase the ocean surface density and thus, the deep-water production (Van Aken, 2007). However, we observe a decrease in WBUC intensity along with the ongoing Miocene cooling phase. The WBUC transports lower (DSOW) and upper (ISOW) NCW in different core depths. It is possible that we only observe one of the two different cores at the Eirik Drift region. As we observe a shallowing and thus weakening during a cold phase, we interpret the observed NCW flow as the upper NCW (ISOW), which more likely weakened and shallowed in a cooling regime. We suggest that the lower NCW (DSOW) flowed at larger depths outside of our study area (Fig. 2 b). At 8. 1 and 7. 5 Ma the reflector doublet R 3 /R 4 was formed by NCW pulses with inhibited NCW flow at 9 Ma and 7 Ma (Mueller-Michaelis et al., 2012 (submitted)). We suggest short-term temperature fluctuations to result in strong NCW pulses with similar pathways like between 12 and 8 Ma (Fig. 2 b). During the following deposition of subunit SUIII-b (7. 5 - 5. 6 Ma) the observed WBUC influence at the Erik Drift further weakened. The WBUC here was presumably too weak to (re) deposit sediments on top of the piled drift axis. We address this weakening to the ongoing climate cooling, resulting in an intensification of a deeper, denser lower NCW (DSOW) flow outside of our study area, and a weakening of the observed upper NCW (ISOW) flow. Thus, the WBUC at the Eirik Drift stayed weak until the climate started to warm again at 6 Ma with an increase in WBUC activity in the study area observed at reflector R 2 (5. 6 Ma). Between 5. 6 - 4. 5 Ma we observe an increasing WBUC at the Eirik Drift with its maximum intensity leading to the formation of the erosional unconformity at 4. 5 Ma (Table 1) (Kaminski et al., 1989) along with climate warming. For the first time, we observe two branches of NCW flow at the Eirik Drift. The lower branch flows over ODP Leg 105 Site 646 and was identified as rather DSOW (lower NCW) then ISOW (upper NCW) (Kaminski et al., 1989). We therefore conclude that the upper branch transported ISOW (upper NCW). The two branches of WBUC at the Eirik Drift are of maximum intensity observed here. Nevertheless, we interpret this observation as a shallowing and weakening of the NCW flow system in the northern North Atlantic during warming climate. During the preceding cool phases the one observed branch is assumed to transport ISOW (upper NCW) and the flow of DSOW (lower NCW) is suggested to proceed at greater depth and/or different pathways outside of our study area. Along with the climate warming the WBUC system shallows and hence, the intense deep branch of NCW flow lies within our study area. The DSOW (lower NCW) flow during this warming period is, even though it is assumed to have shallowed and weakened, still of higher intensity than the upper NCW (ISOW) flow during the cold phases. With the end of mid Pliocene warmth cooling started again at 3. 6 Ma, and the WBUC intensity of DSOW and ISOW flow remained strong and the pathways almost the same until 2. 5 Ma. The onset of drift building at the Gloria Drift (Fig. 1) at 4 Ma (Wold, 1994) indicates the onset of deep-water formation in the Labrador Sea along with the Pliocene cooling (Fig. 2 c). Entrainment of less dense LSW to the dense overflows may explain why we do not observe intensification and deepening of the WBUC system during Pliocene cooling. At 2. 5 Ma the intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (NHG) is documented in the sedimentary record of ODP Leg 105 Site 646 (Arthur et al., 1989). We observe a gradual shallowing and deepening of 2 WBUC branches after 2. 5 Ma at the Eirik Drift NHG. The expanded Nordic ice shields isolate the surface ocean from exchanges in heat, freshwater and momentum with the overlying atmosphere and might have shifted the deep water formation region to the south. This southward shift possibly account for less dense overflow waters even in a cold regime. Also the changes of NCW composition due to the entrainment of LSW should be considered. Based on our data and the geological records at the ODP/IODP sites at the Eirik Drift, we deciphered parts of the complex interplay of changes in the NCW flow and climate in the northern North Atlantic.
