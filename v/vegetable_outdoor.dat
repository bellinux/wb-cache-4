40|$|Leek (Allium porrum L.) is an {{important}} <b>outdoor</b> <b>vegetable</b> in West Europe, where it is cultivated on about 30, 000 ha. Most commercial cultivars of leek are open pollinated. One of the major problems with the crop is poor uniformity. Leek is an outbreeding species with up to 20 % self-fertilisation. Much of the variation of open pollinated cultivars is explained by the strong sensitivity to inbreeding depression after selfing. In this study we attempt to analyse in a systematic way the relationship between degree of selfing and agricultural performance in leek. The results obtained confirm a negative correlation between selfing and some agricultural aspects important for vigour such as seedling emergence, plant growth and plant fresh yield. Also negative correlations between degree of selfing and seed individual weight and between selfing and seed individual size were found. The negative relationship between inbreeding and plant weight at harvest is further confirmed in an experiment in which the origin (cross-pollination or self-pollination) of each individual offspring plant analysed was determined using AFLP-markers.

This insect is morphologically very similar to S. litura but the two species occupy very distinct geographical distributions, with only S. littoralis found in Europe and Africa. S. littoralis is established only in the southernmost parts of Europe where winters are not too cold. Long-distance northward migrations occur and the pest can also be transported throughout the EU with plants for planting. S. littoralis is highly polyphagous and it is an important pest of a very wide variety of <b>outdoor</b> <b>vegetable,</b> salad and ornamental crops in southern Europe. Field crops, such as lucerne, can also be affected, and even football pitches can be damaged. Population densities and damage vary considerably from year to year.

Resistance management and successful control of the pest can be obtained with mass trapping, mating disruption and attract-and-kill methods. S. littoralis is listed in Annex IAII and special requirements for S. littoralisare formulated in Annexes IVAI and IVAII of Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC to regulate the movement of plants for planting of three ornamental genera (Dendranthema, Dianthus and Pelargonium) ...|$|R

40|$|Current field {{vegetable}} {{production in}} the Netherlands has difficulty {{to meet the requirements}} of the EU directives on water quality and to meet the market require¬ments on food safety, product quality and predictability. Therefore, a multiannual research program has been carried out to develop new soilless systems for field vegetables next to other outdoor horticultural crops. Profitability is a precondition for widespread implementation of these systems and to achieve a significant sustainability impact. This paper focuses on the potential of Deep Flow cultivation systems for vegetables to improve farm management and economics for growers. Results show that these crops give a yield increase on the soilless systems with respect to the soil bound system, mainly by faster growth and higher plant densities. At this moment, the cost prices for vegetables cultivated on this soilless system on a small scale are higher than conventional <b>outdoor</b> <b>vegetables,</b> because of the high capital costs for the soilless system in comparison with the costs for tractors and agricultural machinery and the higher energy requirement for water circulation. We expect that growers are able to make the system profitable for leek, lettuce and spinach by up scaling, optimization of production, mechanization and automation of the system. Product differentiation to high value market segments also offers perspectives to profitable systems, although the thus achieved cultivated area and sustainability impact on a national scale will be limited. The large investment costs in the systems may be a barrier for growers to change over to the soilless cropping system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs {{the global}} {{population}} continues to increase, rural areas {{are expected to}} accommodate future growth {{at the same time}} as continuing to feed growing populations. This tension is greatest on those who farm land that is earmarked for future urban growth. Yet, little is known about the attitudes and values of the affected rural farming communities or farmers’ perceptions of the challenges and opportunities that population growth presents. This paper presents the results from a survey of <b>outdoor</b> <b>vegetable</b> growers in Pukekohe, an area under increasing pressure from urban growth, located in Auckland, New Zealand’s fastest growing city. An analysis of rural fragmentation is also provided to demonstrate the extent of land use change to help contextualise growers’ responses. Survey results showed that economic discourses fail to fully capture the symbolic meaning the land has for growers; many participants were deeply connected to the land, with the desire for the farming legacy to continue, while also recognising its highly productive capability. Participating growers identified numerous challenges and opportunities as a consequence of urban growth. Key challenges included: reverse sensitivity associated with development pressures; achieving sustainable productivity and profits; and perceptions of an increasingly bureaucratic legislative environment. Key opportunities included: occupation of a unique vegetable growing environment; capitalising on the area’s close proximity to city markets; and for a minority of participants, possible financial gains through residential housing development. Geospatial analysis demonstrated a large degree of rural fragmentation that can lead to adverse cumulative effects without the intervention of policy. Future research needs to focus on determining the consequences of continuous development pressures onto versatile land in relation to a country’s, current and future, food-growing capacity. This will be imperative as the population continues to grow. It will not only inform the environmental impacts of these land use decisions but also the socio-economic consequences that will aid with fully informed planning, policy and decision-making that account for a multiplicity of needs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In the UK, {{vegetable}} and salad crops are grown outdoors throughout the year, their seasonality dependent {{mainly on the}} ability of the crop to withstand low temperatures in winter. These crops are subject to infestation by a range of pests, most of which have caused concern for growers for many years. Control of pest insects on <b>outdoor</b> <b>vegetable</b> and salad crops in the UK is highly reliant on insecticides and growers are fortunate that they continue to have access to a range of insecticides with different modes of action. Even so, some pests and/or the viruses they transmit are difficult to manage with the tools available at present and for some species a very limited range of modes of action are available. Despite the potential availability of different modes of action, pyrethroid insecticides are used widely and it is of concern that incidences of pyrethroid resistance in pest species are increasing. The selection pressure from use of pyrethroids, and potentially other insecticide groups, is exacerbated by the fact that many pest species infest both arable and horticultural crops. Vegetable and salad growers have access to information and tools to forecast infestations and monitor a number of key pests to optimise insecticide use. However, without undertaking a very detailed study it is difficult to gauge the impact of this information, both in terms of any potential reduction in insecticide use and improved levels of control. Other management tools such as fine mesh netting crop covers, host plant resistance and biopesticides are used on a relatively small scale. It appears that {{one of the main reasons}} why Integrated Pest Management is not being taken up more widely is because of a lack of alternative tools and management practices that are both effective and cost-effective and there is a considerable need for these to be developed and transferred to growers in a form that they can use. They include: reliable, cost effective and simple monitoring and decision support systems; control strategies with less side effects on beneficial organisms; more knowledge about spraying technology and alternative ways of applying insecticides; more effort to breed for pest resistance; alternative control strategies such as those using pheromones. Finally, although functional biodiversity is not easy to implement and manage, and its efficacy is neither proven nor predictable, it needs to be investigated in more detail and it undoubtedly needs to be coordinated at a landscape scale. ...|$|R
40|$|Current {{environmental}} monitoring of pesticides (crop protection products) in Sweden mainly concentrates on investigating possible leaching of pesticides used within agriculture. However, {{there is a}} lack of knowledge on how these compounds behave in the environment after their use within horticultural production. In certain parts of southern Sweden there are extensive areas of <b>outdoor</b> fruit and <b>vegetable</b> crops, as well as greenhouse crops. Greenhouses have in some contexts been regarded as 'closed environments'. This has meant that the same high demands have not always been applied when assessing the risks of harmful effects to neighbouring waters of crop protection products used in greenhouses compared with those used in <b>outdoor</b> <b>vegetable</b> crops. The aim of this investigation was to broaden our knowledge of possible leaching to water of pesticides used in field cultivation of horticultural crops and in greenhouses. The investigation, which was carried out in 2008, is the most comprehensive to date as regards the number of pesticides analysed in Swedish watercourses. The analyses comprised 126 different substances, 39 of which have not been investigated previously within Swedish {{environmental monitoring}}. The investigation consisted of surface water sampling in six areas with extensive growing of horticultural crops. Field growing of berries occurred in the catchment area in SE Småland, vegetables in NE Skåne and fruit in SE Skåne. Greenhouse cultivation took place in the catchment area in W Skåne and NW Skåne. Some 10 samples per area were collected during the period May-October 2008. In addition, around 20 water samples were collected for analysis from one of the areas included in national environmental monitoring (area N 34 in Halland). A few samples were also taken of the effluent water from greenhouses with recirculation systems. A total of 78 of the 126 substances included in the investigation were encountered, with a range of between 24 and 44 substances detected in water from the individual areas. The highest numbers of substances and the highest concentrations were detected in the area with intensive vegetable growing in NE Skåne, in the area in Halland and in the two areas with greenhouse growing. Lower concentrations and fewer substances were found in water from the area in SE Småland with strawberry cultivation and from the area in SE Skåne with apple orchards. The guideline value was exceeded in most of the samples collected from the area in NE Skåne and in all samples from the two greenhouse areas (W Skåne and NW Skåne), with the highest exceedences in the latter two areas. The insecticide imidacloprid was the substance that exceeded the guideline value most frequently in this investigation. Some of the substances encountered at elevated levels in water from the areas with greenhouse cultivation were also detected in the samples of effluent water taken from the greenhouses. Substances used widely in ornamental plant production in the greenhouse were also found in the watercourse in W Skåne. The results show that there is leaching of crop protection products from Swedish greenhouses. Future work should therefore aim to identify potential risk elements associated with crop protection operations in the greenhouse, with the aim of decreasing losses of crop protection products to neighbouring waters...|$|R
40|$|With {{an annual}} {{production}} of about 250 000 to 300 000 tons, onion (Allium cepa L.) {{is the most}} important <b>outdoor</b> <b>vegetable</b> crop in the Netherlands. The greater part, namely 70 to 80 %, has to be exported, and is meeting increasing competition. For this reason and in connection with changed growing and handling methods, including mechanization, {{there is a need to}} breed improved varieties. Breeding-work with the biennial onion, however, takes much time and shortening of the breeding cycle would be very profitable. This has been the purpose of the present research. By means of literature data, all phases of growth and development. have been investigated. Flower induction and initiation appeared to be dependent on temperature, but not on day length. At first we tried to promote rapid flowering of the bulbs by means of temperature treatments (chapter 3. 1). This did not give satisfactory results. Development was very irregular and slow and only exceptionnally all the plants became generative (table 3). Nevertheless, we obtained more information about the factors required for development. We showed that the optimum temperature for flower induction for the cultivar "Rijnsburger" is 9 ° C rather than 13 ° C (graph 4). Moreover, short heat treatments before and after the storage period stimulate the regrowth (graph 2), but counteract the floral development (antivernalisation and devernalisation). This explains why the yield of seeds after storage of the mother bulbs under supra-optimal temperatures is lower than after storage under sub-optimal temperatures. Abortion of the young scapes (flower stalks) occurs exclusively under long days and to a greater extent at high temperatures (table 6). Our observations indicate that abortion is dependent on the distribution of assimilates between the scape and an axillary bud (photo 3). A "bulb/flower competition hypothesis" was formulated in the sense that, just as with onions grown for bulb production, in long days and at higher temperatures this axillary bud swells, which results in abortion of the scape (photo 4). Hitherto rarely different stages of development in onion in relation to optimal conditions have been distinguished. For a good development different conditions of day length and temperature appeared to be required. For that reason an outline was proposed that consists of three phases: Thermo-phase. Flower induction and initiation are dependent on the temperature, irrespective of day length. Competition-phase. Under long day and high temperatures, abortion may occur but at low temperatures (about 9 ° C) the flower scape develops, even in long days. Completion-phase. For a good further development long days are necessary and a high temperature is beneficial. Based on this information an annual breeding cycle has been realized by using onion plants (chapter 3. 2). Early in September the seeds were sown in a greenhouse under natural short day conditions, in which bulbing and the associated rest period are prevented. With supplementary light during the daytime and day and night- temperatures of 16 ° C and 13 ° C respectively, in about 100 days strong plants were obtained. In the middle of December this plant material was transplanted and kept under long days at 9 ° C, under which circumstances flower induction and initiation were promoted and bulbing and abortion were completely inhibited (photo 7). In April the temperature was raised to 18 ° C and in May to at least 21 ° C. Under these temperature conditions and natural long days without supplementary light, all the plants developed into good seed plants, the seeds of which were harvested by mid July. In the beginning of August, 11 months after the initial sowing, these new seeds could be sown. An extra gain in time of at least one month is possible, by using unripe seeds with a maximum moisture content of 50 % (chapter 3. 3). By using a higher light intensity during the raising period and further improvements in the day length and temperature regime during the competition and completion phases, it is probably possible to obtain four generations in three years. Finally, some possibilities for application of the results in breeding projects have been discussed (chapter 4) ...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{potential}} impact of conventional chemical pesticides on human health and on the environment, governments worldwide are developing policies to reduce the use of these pesticides. Instruments like the EU directive 91 / 414 /EEC, have resulted in the withdrawal of many active ingredients from the market. Furthermore, the new EU directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the sustainable use of pesticides states that non-chemical methods should be given priority wherever possible. To improve the sustainability of agriculture and to avoid resistance development against the receding number of active ingredients remaining on the market, biological alternatives for conventional chemical pesticides are much sought after and even urgently needed. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) are one of those alternatives. They are used for the biological control of an increasing number of insect pests. These bio-insecticides are exceptionally safe for farmers, farm workers, for consumers and for the environment. However, they may have lower efficacy than conventional chemical pesticides. Nonetheless, EPN are equivalent to or even better than conventional chemical insecticides in controlling a number of commercially important pests (e. g., against black vine weevil, citrus root weevil, cranberry girdler, hunting billbug and western corn rootworm). Poor efficacy against other pests can be the result of inappropriate application methods, the use of poor quality products or suboptimal application conditions. This work focused on optimizing the application of EPN in field vegetables. The general aim of this work was to test and, where possible, to improve the control potential of EPN against three difficult to reach pests, described in detail in chapter 1, viz. : the leaf-bound cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) in cauliflower, the soil-bound cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) in cauliflower and the cryptic onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) in leek. Depending on the target pest, the experiments described in chapters 2 to 5 examined the effect of (1) adding adjuvants to the spray suspension, (2) altering the application rate of the EPN and (3) adapting the application technique and/or (4) the timing of the application(s). Chapter 2 focused on improving the formulation and application of EPN on leaves using laboratory tests with special attention to one specific pest: the cabbage moth. Suitable adjuvants for EPN spray applications were selected based on the absence of toxic or immobilizing effects on two EPN species: Steinernema feltiae and S. carpocapsae. The selected humectants and dispersants were further screened for their effects on the sedimentation of these EPN species in a tank suspension. Next, the effect of three suitable surfactants and a humectant and the effect of nozzle size on the deposition of S. carpocapsae on hydrophobic cauliflower leaves was investigated. Subsequently, a laboratory experiment verified whether brewer’s yeast extract can be used as an attractant for the cabbage moth larvae, and whether it improves the mortality caused by EPN to cabbage moth larvae. Finally, the effect of the most suitable surfactant and humectant, selected from the deposition test, on the longevity and on the infectivity of S. carpocapsae, is presented. These experiments have shown that all selected alcohol ethoxylates (Synperonic 91 / 5, Synperonic 91 / 6, Synperonic 10 / 6 and Atplus 245) and the selected alkylpolysaccharide (AL- 2575) immobilized both S. carpocapsae and S. feltiae when mixed in the spray suspension. Xanthan gum remains the best sedimentation-retarding agent. An ISO 02 standard flat fan nozzle can clog when spraying S. carpocapsae. An ISO 04 standard flat fan nozzle provides a higher relative deposition of different S. carpocapsae-adjuvant suspensions on cauliflower leaves than the bigger ISO 08 standard flat fan nozzle. Three spreading agents (Silwet L- 77, SB Plant Invigorator and Addit) roughly doubled the relative EPN deposition with both the ISO 04 and the ISO 08 nozzle when added to the EPN suspension. Addition of xanthan gum did not significantly increase deposition any further. Addition of yeast extract to a foliar spray containing S. carpocapsae significantly increased mortality of the cabbage moth and decreased the amount of leaf damage caused by these caterpillars. And finally, it was shown that adding Addit and xanthan gum to a spray suspension containing S. carpocapsae prolongs the survival of EPN on leaves, and that these adjuvants can cause mortality in larvae of Galleria mellonella. It was however deemed unlikely, and proven in a field test (chapter 3), that Addit and xanthan gum at the used concentrations, would {{have a significant effect on}} insect plagues in field conditions. The field experiments described in chapter 3 implemented the results of chapter 2 and aimed to optimize the control of cabbage moth with S. carpocapsae. A spray application tools test, was performed to select a spray application technique that leads to a maximum of spray coverage on specific parts of the cauliflower plant. The targeted spraying areas were: (1) the central part of the plant, where the cabbage moth larvae can cause direct economic damage to the cauliflower head, and (2) the underside of the leaves, where the young larvae hide during the day and feed during the night. The test showed that two spray boom configurations with vertical extensions in the crop covered the lower side of the outer leaves very well, while also securing statistically equal coverage of the underside of the centre leaves, when compared to all other configurations. Therefore, one of these configurations, a spray boom configuration with TeeJet TP 80 04 EVS nozzles mounted on the horizontal spray boom and TeeJet UB 85 04 nozzles mounted 38 cm long vertical extensions, was selected for the field trial with S. carpocapsae. An adjuvant trial, determined whether S. carpocapsae, applied in the field with this technique, could effectively reduce the cabbage moth numbers in a cauliflower crop and/or the damage to this crop. It also tested if these parameters could be further reduced by adding yeast extract and/or Addit and xanthan gum to the tank suspension. An application rate trial and an application technique trial, were set up (1) to test the effect of different application rates of EPN on cabbage moth control and (2) to confirm if the application technique selected in the spray application tools test was indeed better suited than a standard broadcast spray application, for controlling the cabbage moth. In the adjuvant trial, the numbers of damaged cabbage heads clearly demonstrate a protective effect of spraying with a suspension of S. carpocapsae, when combined with Addit and xanthan gum. It was noticeable that Bt applications outperformed all other treatments, although the difference was not always significant. Based on these results, EPN might provide an extra control option against the cabbage moth, if the efficacy of EPN treatments can be further enhanced. Similar to the adjuvant trial, the numbers of cabbage moth larvae were highly variable between individual plants in both the application rate trial and the application technique trial, making it difficult to distinguish statistical differences between the mean number of caterpillars per plant. However, leaf damage measurements and the number of infected plants proved to be much less variable and thus much more reliable than counting numbers of caterpillars for assessing control by S. carpocapsae and Bt treatments in both trials. Only the Bt applications with the adapted spray boom effectively stopped damage development caused by the cabbage moth. Furthermore, the plots that received Bt with the adapted spray boom were the only plots that contained significantly less infected plants than the control plots. The protection against sunlight on the underside of leaves, together with better placement of the Bt spray may explain the better control of the Bt applications with the adapted spray boom compared with the regular spray boom. This chapter shows that there is much room for improvement in the foliar application of EPN against cabbage moth. Control results were probably largely dependent on the temperature. More cold-tolerant species, strains or breeding products of EPN should be searched for, so that they can be used against the cabbage moth, before any conclusions can be drawn on the optimal application rate of the EPN. The deposition measurements in all trials suffered from high variability. This was most probably caused by the plant architecture of cauliflower: due to the overlap of leaves, some areas of the plant are difficult to spray. This variability is a major concern for biocontrol agents like Bt and EPN, since areas that are not sprayed, are not protected against the targeted pest. When a low temperature active EPN species/strain/breeding product, efficacious against the cabbage moth, becomes available, then EPN applications might be fitted into biological control schemes to prevent development of resistance of cabbage moth against Bt. This is of major importance, since cabbage moth already seems to possess some innate resistance against Bt products. Chapter 4 presents three field tests with applications of IJ of S. feltiae against cabbage root fly in cauliflower. These tests focused on finding an optimal application rate (200, 000 IJ/plant vs. 50, 000 IJ/plant), a suitable application technique (plant tray spraying vs. drench application) and a good timing of the application (application at planting vs. application one week after planting vs. application two weeks after planting, with or without one or two follow-up treatment(s)). The results demonstrated that a plant tray spray with S. feltiae is superior to a drench application in controlling cabbage root fly in cauliflower. Plant tray sprayings with S. feltiae can reduce the percentage of dead plants compared with the non-treated control. The lack of an application rate-effect relationship suggests that it might be possible to further reduce the applied rate of S. feltiae without causing a significant reduction in control. Numbers of cabbage maggots around the plant roots can be temporarily reduced by plant tray sprays with a rate of 200, 000 IJ S. feltiae per cauliflower plant. Mortality results of bait tests with wax moth larvae on soil samples taken from around the cauliflower plants, showed that IJ of S. feltiae, applied as a plant tray spray, take one to two weeks to spread into the soil around the roots of cauliflower. These bait tests also showed that the most effective period of IJ of S. feltiae in the soil is limited up to five weeks, which warrants a follow-up treatment. Further research should examine whether the application rate of IJ of S. feltiae in a plant tray spray can be lowered, while maintaining a good control, and whether a follow-up application of S. feltiae, applied three to five weeks after planting with a better suited technique (e. g., injection), would further improve control of cabbage root fly. Chapter 5 presents two field trials in leek set up to determine and, if possible, to improve the effect of spray applications with S. feltiae against onion thrips in leek. The first trial was carried out on an organic farm and focused on selecting a suitable spray application technique and on testing the effect of an attractant on thrips control. The second trial focused on incorporating spray applications of EPN in a conventional insecticide scheme, and on the effect of mixing the surfactant Addit in the spray suspension on the control of onion thrips. The results show that the selected commercial strain of S. feltiae was not effective against the foliar inhabiting life stages of onion thrips in leek. Mixing a thrips attractant in the spray suspension and spraying with adapted spray equipment (band application and row application) did not improve the efficacy. Compared with the traditional spray boom technique, the row application technique ensured a more even EPN deposition on both the upper side and underside of both old and new leek leaves. This technique offers good potential for improving the applications of fungicides and of contact insecticides in leek. The general discussion in chapter 6 links the obtained results, and suggests directions for future research. The described experimental work with EPN against the cabbage moth, cabbage root fly and onion thrips showed that significant control of the first two pests is certainly possible in <b>outdoor</b> <b>vegetables,</b> but it also showed that there’s still a long way to go before EPN will be applied commercially against these pests in <b>outdoor</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Efficient control of insect pests with EPN requires a perfect match between several factors: the EPN species/strain/breeding product, the pest, the crop, the application (in terms of technique, formulation and application rate) and the environmental conditions. Matching these factors requires the screening and breeding of much more EPN species/strains for different properties (e. g., pathogenicity, temperature tolerance, mobility, drought resistance). In the short term, research on EPN applications against greenhouse pests seems to be the most promising area of research in temperate climates. Only when the prices for EPN drop due to more widespread adoption and when new EPN species/strains/breeding products and application techniques become available, will outdoor applications of EPN become commercially viable. Because pest control with EPN is obviously not a one-size fits-all solution, farmers will need appropriate knowledge to obtain successful pest control with EPN. Moreover, the upcoming EU obligation for farmers to use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) methods to protect their crops will further increase the demand for knowledge on IPM methods. Governmental, NGO and corporate advisory networks will need to be strengthened in order to fulfil this demand and to keep European crops healthy...|$|R
