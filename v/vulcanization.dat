25|$|Thermosets, or {{thermosetting}} polymers, can melt {{and take}} shape only once: {{after they have}} solidified, they stay solid. In the thermosetting process, a chemical reaction occurs that is irreversible. The <b>vulcanization</b> of rubber {{is an example of}} a thermosetting process: before heating with sulfur, the polyisoprene is a tacky, slightly runny material; after <b>vulcanization,</b> the product is rigid and non-tacky.|$|E

25|$|RTV {{silicone}} (room temperature <b>vulcanization</b> silicone) is {{used primarily}} as a molding material as {{it is very easy}} to use but is relatively expensive. Few other materials stick to it, making molds easy to separate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vulcanization</b> {{of rubber}} creates {{disulfide}} bonds between chains, which limits the {{degrees of freedom}} and results in chains that tighten more quickly for a given strain, thereby increasing the elastic force constant and making the rubber harder and less extensible.|$|E
25|$|Sodium acetate {{is used in}} {{the textile}} {{industry}} to neutralize sulfuric acid waste streams and also as a photoresist while using aniline dyes. It is also a pickling agent in chrome tanning and helps to impede <b>vulcanization</b> of chloroprene in synthetic rubber production. In processing cotton for disposable cotton pads, sodium acetate is used to eliminate the buildup of static electricity.|$|E
25|$|The {{transition}} from a traditional wooden sole to one of vulcanized rubber {{may be attributed to}} Charles Goodyear and Leverett Candee. The qualities of rubber, though fascinating to Goodyear, were highly dependent on temperature: it was tacky when hot, brittle when cold. <b>Vulcanization</b> of rubber tempered its properties so that it was easily molded, durable, and tough. A rubberized elastic webbing made Goodyear's galoshes (circa 1890) easy to pull on and off.|$|E
25|$|Ancient rubber {{was made}} from latex of the rubber tree (Castilla elastica), which is {{indigenous}} to the tropical areas of southern Mexico and Central America. The latex was made into rubber by mixing it with the juice of what was likely Ipomoea alba (a species of morning glory), a process which preceded Goodyear's <b>vulcanization</b> by several millennia. The resultant rubber would then be formed into rubber strips, which would be wound around a solid rubber core to build the ball.|$|E
25|$|Natural rubber is an {{elastomer}} (an elastic hydrocarbon polymer) {{that originally}} {{was derived from}} latex, a milky colloidal suspension found in specialised vessels in some plants. It is useful directly in this form (indeed, the first appearance of rubber in Europe was cloth waterproofed with unvulcanized latex from Brazil). However, in 1839, Charles Goodyear invented vulcanized rubber; a form of natural rubber heated with sulfur (and a few other chemicals), forming cross-links between polymer chains (<b>vulcanization),</b> improving elasticity and durability.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all {{chemical}} reactions can occur at normal temperatures (although different reactions proceed at different rates). However most reactions are accelerated by high temperatures, and {{the degradation of}} foods and pharmaceuticals is no exception. The same applies to the breakdown of many chemical explosives into more unstable compounds. Nitroglycerine is notorious. Old explosives are thus more dangerous (i.e. liable to be triggered to explode by very small disturbances, even trivial jiggling) than more recently manufactured explosives. Rubber products also degrade as sulphur bonds induced during <b>vulcanization</b> revert; this is why old rubber bands and other rubber products soften and get crispy, and lose their elasticity as they age.|$|E
500|$|As part {{of their}} {{adaptation}} from marine life, terrestrial plants began producing non-marine antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), polyphenols and tocopherols. [...] The evolution of angiosperm plants between 50 and 200 million years ago resulted {{in the development of}} many antioxidant pigments– particularly during the Jurassic period– as chemical defences against reactive oxygen species that are byproducts of photosynthesis. Originally, the term antioxidant specifically referred to a chemical that prevented the consumption of oxygen. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, extensive study concentrated on the use of antioxidants in important industrial processes, such as the prevention of metal corrosion, the <b>vulcanization</b> of rubber, and the polymerization of fuels in the fouling of internal combustion engines.|$|E
2500|$|Sulfenamides, e.g. cyclohexylthiophthalimide, {{are used}} {{extensively}} in the <b>vulcanization</b> of rubber. [...] The sulfenamides are used to accelerate the process via the transient formation of labile S-N bonds. [...] The substituents on the sulfenamides determine {{the point at which}} they will become active. Temperature dependent activation of sulfenamide accelerants is useful in the <b>vulcanization</b> process because the temperature at which the rubber polymerizes determines the length of the sulfur chains, and properties such as the elasticity of the final product.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1800s, as {{industrial}} chemistry {{developed during}} the Industrial Revolution, many materials were reported. [...] The development of plastics also accelerated with Charles Goodyear's discovery of <b>vulcanization</b> to thermoset materials derived from natural rubber.|$|E
2500|$|Sulfenamides (also spelled sulphenamides) [...] are a {{class of}} {{organosulfur}} compounds characterized by the general formula RSNR'2, where R and R' are H, alkyl, or aryl. [...] Sulfenamides have been used extensively in the <b>vulcanization</b> of rubber using sulfur. They {{are related to the}} oxidized compounds sulfinamides (RS(O)NR'2) and sulfonamides (RS(O)2NR'2).|$|E
2500|$|This is {{a commercially}} {{available}} product prepared from amorphous sulfur {{that has not}} been stretched prior to extraction of soluble forms with CS2. It sometimes called [...] "white sulfur of Das" [...] or supersublimated sulfur. It is a mixture of ψ-sulfur and lamina sulfur. The composition depends on the exact method of production and the samples history. One well known commercial form is [...] "Crystex". ω-sulfur is used in the <b>vulcanization</b> of rubber.|$|E
2500|$|However, the Smithsonian has {{subsequently}} reversed this stance, {{deciding that}} the golden hue on its engine cowling will remain, {{as it is}} part of the aircraft's natural state after acquisition and during its years on display. The effort to preserve artifacts is not to alter them but to maintain them as much as possible in the state in which the Smithsonian acquired them. Also, when the aircraft was recently lowered to the floor of the museum's Milestone's gallery, the tires were removed and replaced with 'forklift' style tires. This was done to preserve the Spirit's original tires which, due to age and lessening of <b>vulcanization,</b> are unable to sustain the aircraft's weight without disintegration. Also, conservation was likely undertaken on the wheel assembly itself.) ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Vulcanization</b> {{refers to}} a {{specific}} curing process of rubber involving high heat {{and the addition of}} sulfur or other equivalent curatives. It is a chemical process in which polymer molecules are linked to other polymer molecules by atomic bridges composed of sulfur atoms or carbon-to-carbon bonds. A vast array of products are made with vulcanized rubber including ice hockey pucks, tires, shoe soles, hoses and many more. When [...] "rubber fever" [...] struck Boston in the 1830s, there was a large consumer demand for products made of rubber- aprons, life preservers, hats, carriage tops, and, by 1836, waterproof shoes. But in the heat of summer, rubber goods turned into a gooey, foul-smelling mess; in the winter, they froze stiff. In 1839, Charles Goodyear had a breakthrough when he mixed liquid latex with sulfur and heating it in the sun or over a stove top. The leather-like form of the stretchable substance resulted in the first vulcanized rubber. Goodyear received a patent on June 15, 1844.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} methods exist for <b>vulcanization.</b> The {{economically}} most important method (<b>vulcanization</b> of tires) uses {{high pressure and temperature}} after the curative has been added to the rubber. A typical <b>vulcanization</b> temperature for a street-vehicle tire is 10 minutes at 177 °C. This process employs the technique known as compression molding, where the rubber article is intended to adopt the shape of the mold. Other methods, for instance to make door profiles for cars, use hot-air <b>vulcanization</b> or microwave-heated <b>vulcanization</b> (both continuous processes).|$|E
50|$|However, {{raw rubber}} was perishable. In 1839 Charles Goodyear {{discovered}} {{the process of}} <b>vulcanization,</b> a method that would cure rubber, making it durable. Rubber erasers became common {{with the advent of}} <b>vulcanization.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The spin {{casting process}} {{typically}} uses vulcanized silicone or organic rubber as the mold-making substrate. <b>Vulcanization</b> {{is an integral}} step that occurs halfway through the mold-making process. Prior to <b>vulcanization,</b> the mold rubber is a soft and malleable solid-like fluid, in many ways very similar to Silly Putty. Because of the clay-like nature at this stage, the mold is easily cut or shaped to accommodate irregular models. <b>Vulcanization</b> serves two purposes: establishing the negative space inside the mold as well as hardening the rubber so it will remain strong and rigid during casting.|$|E
