The {{cross section of}} the scrimber composite is featured by curved thin laminates, which is quite different from existing <b>veneer-based</b> laminated products.|$|E
30|$|Mat-formed wood-based panels such as {{particleboard}} (PB), medium-density fibreboard (MDF), and oriented strandboard (OSB) {{are widely}} used for residential construction. Reductions in the domestic production of <b>veneer-based</b> panel products in Japan {{have resulted in the}} increased use of mat-formed panel products for structural purposes. For such uses, long-term durability is one of the panels’ most important properties [1, 2]. <b>Veneer-based</b> materials, such as plywood (PW), have superior properties compared to other wood-based panels and numerous studies have focussed on their durability [3 – 9]. In contrast, many studies have focussed on correlating deterioration of mat-formed panels, caused by outdoor exposure with accelerated aging [10, 11] including the use of ASTM D 1037 [12], APA D- 1 and D- 4 [13], and V 313 treatments [14].|$|E

This paper introduces {{the production of}} the scrimber composite, investigates its main mechanical properties by experimental tests and provides a comparison between such scrimber and other timber/bamboo-based materials.|$|E

30|$|The {{demands of}} <b>veneer-based</b> {{engineered}} wood products such as plywood, Parallam and laminated veneer lumber have increased recently, as the quality of forest resources have gradually declined. The manufacturing process of plywood involves the gluing of individual veneer sheets to form panels. Therefore, it will be of great benefit to these industries if the main raw material could be sorted {{on the basis of}} stiffness strength prior to the layup of the panels, especially for the construction purpose.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{the results of}} an interdisciplinary work flow concerning the design and construction of a prefabricated structure using poplar plywood. The study, promoted by Politecnico and University of Torino, is related {{to the development of a}} local wood resource focussing on the most traditional and important panel in Italy which, from a consolidated position in the furniture market, is now searching potential and innovative applications especially in the building sector, where the use of modern wooden materials is growing quickly. The Mona Lisa Wood Pavillon investigates the wood design issue from three main points of view. First, the structure is part of the promotion path of poplar plywood, conceptualizing its manufacturing process in an architectural project; then it highlights the role of technology by using an engineered <b>veneer-based</b> product with interesting properties; finally it explores the role of digital design in exploiting the potentialities of the material, in particular through a parametric approach which permits the optimization of design and construction. The project was carried out thanks to the joined efforts of complementary sectors and to the coordinated work of architects, engineers and wood experts. The resulting architecture was built on the occasion of the 2012 Made Expo event, with the patronage of the Italian woodworking associations Federlegno, Assopannelli and Conlegno, together with the technical contribution of several industrial companies, which have sustained this research with the aim of developing a manifesto for a better knowledge of poplar plywoo...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State UniversitySuccessful {{continuous}} or semi-continuous profile forming of wood-strand composites requires {{development of}} the underpinning science, including a suitable binding system, forming defect management, and process-property relationships. A hybrid resin to stabilize the wood-strand preforms for subsequent profile forming and curing was devised using a mixture of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) and phenol formaldehyde (PF) resins. This study examined the influence of PVAc on the cure kinetics of PF with differential scanning calorimetry. Results show that the cure kinetics of PF blended with PVAc does not differ significantly from neat PF resin for blend ratios of 1 or lower. The nth-order Borchardt Daniels model provided good prediction for the curing of adhesive system with a PVAc/PF ratio lower than 1 and neat PF resin. This blended resin system can potentially be used for continuous or semi-continuous profile forming of wood-strand composites. To gain an initial understanding, the complex state of deformations in wood-strand preforms during profiling forming was studied using single-curvature bending. Three failure types were identified based on the primary failure mechanisms in bending, buckling and shear slip. The initial failure in bending was predicted with a strength-based model {{with the goal of}} minimizing defects, such as buckling. A relationship between preform conditions, forming defects and thickness recovery was established. Profile-formed wood-strand composites showed much better shape conformance than profiled <b>veneer-based</b> composites. Slow closing rate and relatively high moisture content caused flat and peak-at-core vertical density profiles (VDP). Lower moisture content resulted in more uniform VDP. The internal stress state in the bend of the profile-formed V-specimens was determined with elastic curved beam theory. Delamination, dominated by radial stress, was the initial failure mode. The Chang-Springer failure criterion was used to determine the initiation of delamination failure within the bend of the V-specimens on roller support. V-specimens tested on pin support yielded greater bending strength than those on roller support. These support conditions provide lower and upper bounds for stresses in the bend of the specimen for some applications. This study adds to the limited knowledge base of profile forming of wood-strand composites and provides an insight into process-property relationships.
