40|$|Before {{moving to}} the pure time series models we shall need the notion of or-thogonal projections. We need this to {{evaluate}} the partial correlation coefficients, especially for Moving Average models. 1 Projections (Orthogonal) Assume the usual linear regression setup, i. e. y = Xβ + u, u|X v D ¡ 0, σ 2 In¢ where y is the n × 1 vector of endogenous variables, X is the n × k matrix of weakly exogenous explanatory variables, β is the k× 1 vector of mean parameters and u is the n × 1 vector of errors. When we estimate a linear regression model, we simply map the regressand y into a vector of fitted values Xbβ and a <b>vector</b> <b>of</b> <b>residuals</b> bu = y−Xbβ. Geometri-cally, these mappings are examples of orthogonal projections. A projection is a mapping that takes each point of En into a point in a subset of En, while leaving all the points of the subset unchanged, where En is the usual Euclidean vector space, i. e. the set of all vectors in Rn where the addition, the scalar multiplication and the inner product (hence the norm) are defined. Because of this invariance the subspace is called invariant subspace of the projection. An orthogonal projection maps any point into {{the point of the}} subspace that is closest to it. If a point is already in the invariant subspace, it is mapped into itself. Algebraically, an orthogonal projection on to a given subspace can be per-formed by premultiplying the vector to be projected by a suitable projection matrix. In the case of OLS, the two projection matrices that yield the vector of fitted values and the <b>vector</b> <b>of</b> <b>residuals,</b> respectively, are PX =...|$|E

In addition we discuss the continuous versions of the methods, which furnish geometric interpretations as evolution processes.

In addition, we observe that the interpretation as evolution process allows to deal with the issues of regularization and with additional constraints...|$|E
40|$|Protecting {{individuals}} and households against mosquito bites with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) or indoor residual spraying (IRS) can suppress entire populations of unusually efficient malaria vector species that predominantly feed indoors on humans. Mosquitoes which usually feed on animals are less reliant on human blood, {{so they are}} far less vulnerable to population suppression effects of such human-targeted insecticidal measures. Fortunately, the dozens of mosquito species which primarily feed on animals are also relatively inefficient <b>vectors</b> <b>of</b> malaria, so personal protection against mosquito bites may be sufficient to eliminate transmission. However, a handful of mosquito species are particularly problematic <b>vectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>residual</b> malaria transmission, because they feed readily on both humans and animals. These unusual vectors feed often enough on humans to be potent malaria vectors, but also often enough on animals to evade population control with LLINs, IRS or any other insecticidal personal protection measure targeted only to humans. Anopheles arabiensis and A. coluzzii in Africa, A. darlingi in South America and A. farauti in Oceania, as well as A. culicifacies species E, A. fluviatilis species S, A. lesteri and A. minimus in Asia, all feed readily on either humans or animals and collectively mediate residual malaria transmission across most of the tropics. Eliminating malaria transmission by vectors exhibiting such dual host preferences will require aggressive mosquito population abatement, rather than just personal protection of humans. Population suppression of even these particularly troublesome vectors is achievable with a variety <b>of</b> existing <b>vector</b> control technologies that remain underdeveloped or underexploited...|$|R
40|$|Anopheles arabiensis is stereotypical <b>of</b> diverse <b>vectors</b> that mediate {{residual}} malaria transmission globally, {{because it}} can feed outdoors upon humans or cattle, or enter but then rapidly exit houses without fatal exposure to insecticidal nets or sprays. Life histories of a well-characterized An. arabiensis population were simulated with a simple but process-explicit deterministic model and relevance to other vectors examined through sensitivity analysis. Where most humans use bed nets, two thirds of An. arabiensis blood feeds and half of malaria transmission events were estimated to occur outdoors. However, it was also estimated that most successful feeds and almost all (> 98  %) transmission events are preceded by unsuccessful attempts to attack humans indoors. The estimated proportion <b>of</b> <b>vector</b> blood meals ultimately obtained from humans indoors is dramatically attenuated by availability of alternative hosts, or partial ability to attack humans outdoors. However, the estimated proportion of mosquitoes old enough to transmit malaria, and which have previously entered a house at least once, is far less sensitive to both variables. For vectors with similarly modest preference for cattle over humans and similar ability to evade fatal indoor insecticide exposure once indoors, > 80  % of predicted feeding events by mosquitoes old enough to transmit malaria are preceded {{by at least one}} house entry event, so long as ≥ 40  % of attempts to attack humans occur indoors and humans outnumber cattle ≥ 4 -fold. While the exact numerical results predicted by such a simple deterministic model should be considered only approximate and illustrative, the derived conclusions are remarkably insensitive to substantive deviations from the input parameter values measured for this particular An. arabiensis population. This life-history analysis, therefore, identifies a clear, broadly-important opportunity for more effective suppression <b>of</b> <b>residual</b> malaria transmission by An. arabiensis in Africa and other important <b>vectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>residual</b> transmission across the tropics. Improved control <b>of</b> predominantly outdoor <b>residual</b> transmission by An. arabiensis, and other modestly zoophagic vectors like Anopheles darlingi, which frequently enter but then rapidly exit from houses, may be readily achieved by improving existing technology for killing mosquitoes indoors...|$|R
