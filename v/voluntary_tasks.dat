40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that persisting activation from a previous task execution does {{not contribute to the}} switch cost in <b>voluntary</b> <b>task</b> switching.

The asymmetric switch cost was used as a marker for persisting activation. Participants switched voluntarily between color naming and word naming. One group was instructed to select unpredictable task sequences. The other group was not instructed to do so. When participants were instructed to be unpredictable, no asymmetric switch cost was observed. When participants were not instructed to be unpredictable, an asymmetric switch cost was observed. We conclude that the amount of persisting activation in <b>voluntary</b> <b>task</b> switching is limited and that the switch cost in <b>voluntary</b> <b>task</b> switching reflects the time needed for reconfiguring the cognitive system from one task to another rather than the time needed to compensate for persisting activation...|$|R

40|$|Recently, Demanet and Liefooghe (2014, Experiment 3) {{reported}} an experiment on <b>voluntary</b> <b>task</b> switching {{in which the}} number of candidate tasks to choose from was reduced from four to two before participants indicated their task choice.

This procedure is highly similar to a procedure recently employed by Kleinsorge and Scheil (in press) in a study of cued task switching which yielded evidence for a selective facilitation of task switches by a reduction of the number of tasks to two. In order to examine whether a similar effect would also be observed with <b>voluntary</b> <b>task</b> switching, we conceptually replicated the experiment of Demanet and Liefooghe with an additional control condition in which the number of tasks was not reduced.

In addition, we observed evidence for a selective advantage of forced switch trials over repetition-possible trials that was largely independent of the duration of the preparation interval.

40|$|Muscle {{activity}} occurring during human locomotion can {{be accounted}} for by five basic temporal activation patterns in a variety of locomotion conditions. Here, we examined how these activation patterns interact with muscle activity required for a voluntary movement. Subjects produced a voluntary movement during locomotion, and we examined the resulting kinematics, kinetics, and EMG activity in 16 - 31 ipsilateral limb and trunk muscles during the tasks. There were four <b>voluntary</b> <b>tasks</b> added to overground walking (approximately 5 km/h) in which subjects kicked a ball, stepped over an obstacle, or reached down and grasped an object on the floor (weight support on either the right or the left foot). Statistical analyses of EMG waveforms showed that the five basic locomotion patterns were invariantly present in each task, although they could be differently weighted across muscles, suggesting a characteristic locomotion timing of muscle activations. We also observed a separate activation that was timed to the voluntary task. The coordination of locomotion with the voluntary task was accomplished by combining activation timings that were associated separately with the voluntary task and locomotion. Activation associated with the <b>voluntary</b> <b>tasks</b> was either synchronous with the timing for locomotion or had additional activations not represented in the basic locomotion timing. We propose that this superposition of an invariant locomotion timing pattern with a voluntary activation timing may be consistent with the proposal suggesting that compound movements are produced through a superposition of motor programs...|$|E
40|$|The Brain Motor Control Assessment (BMCA) {{protocol}} is {{a surface}} electromyography (sEMG) -based measure of motor output from {{central nervous system}} during a variety of reflex and voluntary motor tasks performed under strictly controlled conditions. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the BMCA protocol for upper limb with the addition of shoulder <b>voluntary</b> <b>tasks.</b> The voluntary response index (VRI) was calculated from quantitative analysis of sEMG data during defined voluntary movement in neurologically intact people for comparison with that of patients after neurological injuries. The BMCA protocol included one bilateral and 4 unilateral <b>voluntary</b> <b>tasks</b> at different joints of both arms. The VRI, measured from 19 neurologically intact participants, comprises the total muscle activity recorded for the voluntary motor task (magnitude). The calculated similarity index (SI) for each phase of each task show the similarity of "the distribution of activity across the recorded muscles" for that task in this group off participants. The VRI magnitude values from right and left sides for different tasks showed no significant difference (ANOVA: FSide: 0. 09, P =  0. 77). Therefore these values were pooled before calculating SI. SI values were higher for tasks against gravity: elbow flexion (0. 99 ± 0. 03), wrist flexion with palm up (0. 98 ± 0. 03) and wrist extension with palm down (0. 97 ± 0. 07). On the other hand, the SI values were the lowest for bilateral shoulder abduction (0. 84 ± 0. 08) and shoulder adduction (0. 84 ± 0. 08). To validate this index for clinical use, serial studies on patients with neurological impairments should be performed.

Definitive support for this hypothesis is lacking, however, because task choice and task performance are usually confounded. We therefore revisited this hypothesis using a paradigm in which task choice and task performance are temporally separated. As predicted, participants tended to choose the task that was primed by bottom-up biases. Moreover, such choices were linked to increased switch costs during subsequent task performance. These findings provide compelling evidence that bottom-up biases influence <b>voluntary</b> <b>task</b> choice.

40|$|The {{question}} of how the central nervous system coordinates muscle activity is central to an understanding of motor control. The authors argue that motor programs may be considered as a characteristic timing of muscle activations linked to specific kinematic events. In particular, muscle activity occurring during human locomotion can be accounted for by five basic temporal components in a variety of locomotion conditions. Spatiotemporal maps of spinal cord motoneuron activation also show discrete periods of activity. Furthermore, the coordination of locomotion with <b>voluntary</b> <b>tasks</b> is accomplished through a superposition of motor programs or activation timings that are separately associated with each task. As a consequence, the selection of muscle synergies appears to be downstream from the processes that generate activation timings. Copyright Â© 2006 Sage Publications...|$|E

Subjects performed parity or magnitude judgments on single digits. Instructions were to perform the two tasks equally often and in a random order. The response-tostimulus interval (RSI) was either 100 or 1, 000 ms, manipulated between blocks. Task alternations were slower than task repetitions, and this switch cost was greater at the short RSI than at the long RSI (310 and 94 ms, respectively). Additionally, subjects produced more task repetitions than expected if the tasks were performed in a random sequence. These results show costs associated with a <b>voluntary</b> <b>task</b> switch, when subjects must actively control the choice of the task to be performed...|$|R

Central set changed according to the task constraint, as shown by a higher magnitude of both the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscle activation bursts in the HC than in the LC condition. This increase in muscle activation was not reflected, however, in changes in the center of pressure or center of mass displacement. Task constraint influenced the peak shoulder flexion for the <b>voluntary</b> tray <b>task</b> but not the peak hip flexion for the postural task.

By means of a driving simulator experiment, we investigated the effects on recorded and self-reported measures of workload and stress for three task-instruction conditions: (1) No Task, in which participants had to monitor the road, (2) <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Task,</b> in which participants could do whatever they wanted, and (3) Detection Task, in which participants had to detect red cars. Twenty-two participants performed three 40 -min runs in a constant-speed platoon, one condition per run in counterbalanced order. Contrary to some classic literature suggesting that humans are poor monitors, in the Detection Task condition participants attained a high mean detection rate (94. 7 %) and a low mean false alarm rate (0. 8 %).

40|$|Classical {{studies in}} animal {{preparations}} suggest a strong role for spinal control of posture. In humans {{it is now}} established that the cerebral cortex contributes to postural control of unperturbed and perturbed standing. The age-related degeneration and accompanying functional changes in the brain, reported so far mainly in conjunction with simple manual motor tasks, may also affect the mechanisms that control complex motor tasks involving posture. This review outlines the age-related structural and functional changes at spinal and cortical levels and provides a mechanistic analysis of how such changes {{may be linked to}} the behaviorally manifest postural deficits in old adults. The emerging picture is that the age-related reorganization in motor control during <b>voluntary</b> <b>tasks,</b> characterized by differential modulation of spinal reflexes, greater cortical activation and cortical disinhibition, is also present during postural tasks. We discuss the possibility that this reorganization underlies the increased coactivation and dual task interference reported in elderly.

40|$|The {{postural}} {{response to}} {{translation of the}} support surface {{may be influenced by}} the performance of an ongoing <b>voluntary</b> <b>task.</b> This study was designed to test this proposal by applying lateral perturbations while subjects handled a load in the frontal plane. Measurements were made of medio-lateral displacement of the centre of pressure, angular displacement of the trunk and thigh in the frontal plane and intra-abdominal pressure. Subjects were translated randomly to the left and right in a variety of conditions that involved standing either quietly or with a 5 kg load in their left hand, which they were required either to hold statically or to lift or lower. The results indicate that when the perturbation occurred towards the loaded left side the subjects were able to return their centre of pressure, trunk and thigh rapidly and accurately to the initial position. However, when the perturbation occurred towards the right (away from the load) this correction was delayed and associated with multiple changes in direction of movement, suggesting decreased efficiency of the postural response. This reduced efficiency can be explained by a conflict between the motor commands for the ongoing <b>voluntary</b> <b>task</b> and the postural response, and/or by the mechanical effect of the asymmetrical addition of load to the trunk...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the degree of contribution of supraspinal input to the generation of the compensatory leg muscle activation following stance perturbation. Therefore, evoked motor response (EMR) input-output relations of two different motor tasks were compared at 3 distinct periods: (1) the basic period of muscular activity during standing, i. e. when no additional cortical or spinal activity due to the different tasks is to be expected, (2) the pre-movement period with low background activity, when different spinal and cortical inputs to the motoneuronal pool can be assumed and (3) the period of plateau EMG activity of compensatory and <b>voluntary</b> motor <b>task.</b> Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) just below the motor threshold was applied randomly at 19 different time-intervals before and during the onset of stance perturbation and for comparison during an equivalent <b>voluntary</b> foot-dorsiflexion <b>task.</b> Recordings of electromyographic (EMG) activity from the tibialis anterior (TA) and corresponding ankle-joint movements were made from both legs. Forward-directed displacements were induced by randomly-timed ramp impulses of constant acceleration upon a moveable platform. For comparison, leg muscle EMG was recorded during isometric foot dorsiflexion during stance while leaning back against a support. The stance perturbations were followed by a compensatory response (CR) in the TA with a mean onset time of 81 ms. During the basic period of muscular activity and the period of plateau EMG activity there was no significant difference of the input-output relation between stance perturbation and the <b>voluntary</b> motor <b>task.</b> However, in the <b>voluntary</b> <b>task</b> compared with the CR, there was significantly greater input-output relation (facilitation) of the EMR in the TA following TMS, which may be related to an increased cortical influence. In contrast to this result of the CR following stance perturbation, a facilitation of the EMR was described for hand muscles under corresponding conditions of automatic compensation for muscle stretch, suggesting a transcortical reflex loop. This difference in the results from upper and lower extremity muscles favors the assumption of a predominantly spinal generation of the TA-CR following stance perturbation.

40|$|This study aims to {{quantify}} the separate contributions of muscle force feedback, muscle spindle activity and co-contraction {{to the performance of}} <b>voluntary</b> <b>tasks</b> (‘‘reduce the influence of perturbations on maintained force or position’’). Most human motion control studies either isolate only one contributor, or assume that relevant reflexive feedback pathways during voluntary disturbance rejection tasks originate mainly from the muscle spindle. Human ankle-control experiments were performed, using three task instructions and three perturbation characteristics to evoke a wide range of responses to force perturbations. During position tasks, subjects (n = 10) resisted the perturbations, becoming more stiff than when being relaxed (i. e., the relax task). During force tasks, subjects were instructed to minimize force changes and actively gave way to imposed forces, thus becoming more compliant than during relax tasks. Subsequently, linear physiological models were fitted to the experimental data. Inhibitory, as well as excitatory force feedback, was needed to account for the full range of measured experimental behaviors. In conclusion, force feedback {{plays an important role in}} the studied motion control tasks (excitatory during position tasks and inhibitory during force tasks), implying that spindle-mediated feedback is not the only significant adaptive system that contributes to the maintenance of posture or force.

Design: Repeated-measures design. Participants: Twenty-three subjects with patellofemoral pain. Interventions: Quadriceps reflex contraction in response to postero-anterior knee perturbations was measured with three crural muscle contraction conditions and three postural exercises (semi-squatting, tip-toeing and heel standing). Main outcome measures: The electromyographic (EMG) onset time of the VMO and VL during each task was measured and compared across the different tasks. Results: The mean EMG onset time of the VMO was later than that of the VL in the <b>voluntary</b> <b>tasks</b> such as tip-toeing (VMO 95. 3. ms vs VL 36. 4. ms, mean difference 58. 9. ms, 95 % confidence interval - 33. 7 to 151. 5. ms), whereas earlier VMO activation was found in the perturbation tests such as toe standing (VMO 17. 6. ms vs VL 22. 9. ms, mean difference - 5. 3. ms, 95 % confidence interval - 25. 3 to 14. 7. ms).

40|$|Climate change {{policy is}} part of the <b>voluntary</b> <b>tasks</b> of local {{self-government}} in Germany. Therefore, municipal room for manoeuvre could be substantial. However, local government experts argue that local authorities lost steering capacity due to three major trends â EU liberalisation, New Public Management, and budgetary crisis. In contrast, the multi-level governance approach in EU integration theories does not predict a clear cut trend for local steering capacity, but emphasises â softâ steering instruments. Against this theoretical background, the dissertation analyses project examples in the area of buildings, construction, and remediation within the project Klimastadt Bremerhaven to examine whether the project enables the local authority to expand its scope of action and/or to develop new spheres of activity in the policy area of climate protection. This thesis uses an policy analysis approach to examine framework programmes, political processes and key decisions, core actors and their positions, as well as central administrative structures of the Klimastadt project. Apart from political and administrative documents, the thesis draws on four semi-structured interviews. Overall, the empirical findings suggest that the local government has been partially successful in increasing its spheres of (political) influence and its scope of action by using the project Klimastadt Bremerhaven as a coordination mechanism. Yet, especially the budgetary crisis has reduced municipal room for manoeuvre in the building sector.
