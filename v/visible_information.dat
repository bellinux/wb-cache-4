50|$|A {{visible light}} sensor (for example a camera: 0.4 to 0.7 µm) {{is able to}} present an image, which can be {{understood}} by a human being. Furthermore, complex image processing analysis can be executed by computers, which can recognize a flame or even smoke. Unfortunately, a camera can be blinded, like a human, by heavy smoke and by fog. It is also possible to mix <b>visible</b> light <b>information</b> (monitor) with UV or Infrared information, {{in order to better}} discriminate against false alarms or to improve the detection range.

40|$|Recently, {{a number}} of studies have {{demonstrated}} that thermal infrared (IR) imagery offers a promising alternative to visible imagery in face recognition problems due to its invariance to visible illumination changes. However, thermal IR has other limitations such as being opaque to glass. As a result, thermal IR imagery is very sensitive to facial occlusion caused by eyeglasses. Fusion of the visible and thermal IR images is an effective way to solve this problem. In this paper, using the face reconstruction information of the visible images, we propose two thermal image reconstruction algorithms, called the <b>visible</b> <b>information</b> aided eyeglasses removing algorithm (VIAER) and the refined <b>visible</b> <b>information</b> aided eyeglasses removing algorithm (refined VIAER).

40|$|Look who's talking: {{recognizing}} {{friends from}} visible articulation Abstract. We tested whether isolated <b>visible</b> articulatory <b>information</b> {{can be used}} for identifying familiar speakers. A facial point-light methodology was used to isolate the visible articulation of seven speakers. These point-light video clips were then shown to nine participants who had long-term personal interactions with the speakers. Results revealed that participants could iden-tify the speakers at better than chance levels when the faces were shown articulating, but not when the faces were shown without movement. The results indicate that <b>visible</b> articulatory <b>information</b> can be used to identify speakers. Seeing a face move can help with its recognition. Facial movement can facilitate recogni-tion of face images degraded by blurring, inversion, pixelation, and posterization (for a review, see Lander and Chuang 2005). Research has shown that rigid motion (head-shifting) and non-rigid motion (facial expression) can facilitate recognition (for a review, see Lander and Chuang 2005). One question is whether the articulatory information used for visual speech perception (lipreading) can also be used for face recognition. This question has theoretical significance because it has historically been thought tha...|$|R
