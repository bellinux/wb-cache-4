The gold standard measures for assessment of pancreatic function are direct pancreatic stimulation tests, which have numerous limitations. Estimation of fecal elastase- 1 level to determine pancreatic function is an attractive alternative as the test is simple, rapid, cost-effective and easy to perform even in children.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{investigate}} the relationships between natural mentoring and youth academic achievement, attitudes towards school, and psychological well-being in a cross cultural sample of adolescents. It also sought to investigate whether it is the quality of the mentoring relationship and not simply the categorical presence of a natural mentor that is associated with positive youth outcomes. This study also examined {{the reliability and validity of}} the RHI-Y-M. Participants (n = 62) were recruited from two schools in rural Southern Illinois.

40|$|Introduction: This {{study is}} a {{comparison}} between the visual acuity (VA) measurements with the preliterate LogMAR LEA symbols VA chart (LH) and the standardized Early Treatments for Diabetic Retinopathy Study VA chart (ETDRS) in young children to help further define reported <b>validity</b> <b>limitations</b> of the former. Methods: 40 healthy and visually normal children age 40 to 83 months were recruited in a cross-sectional prospective study with all participants being required {{of being able to}} recognize the 10 Sloan letters. Under a standardized and controlled clinical setting, VA was measured monoculary and randomly using both the LEA and the ETDRS charts. Results: VA scores of the two charts were highly correlated with a clinically insignificant over estimation of 0. 04 LogMAR in the LEA chart scores regardless of the subjects’ age or gender. The two charts were in total agreements in the detection of subjects’ inter-ocular difference. Conclusions: This study indicates that the preliterate LEA chart can provide a valid alternative to the ETDRS chart among normal preschoolers. Dalhousie universit...|$|R
40|$|Open-ended {{cognitive}} assessment {{techniques have}} helped illuminate the cognitive structures and processes underlying various clinical problems. The authors review a specific open-ended protocol analysis for assessing cognitive structures and processes—the thought-listing technique. They {{begin with a}} brief description of this technique and its <b>validity,</b> <b>limitations,</b> and potential clinical use. They then review representative research using the thought-listing technique in studies of psychopathology and psychotherapy. They conclude with a discussion of new and potentially useful methods (e. g., adjusted ratio of clustering scores, multidimensional scaling, implicit memory measures) for mapping cognitive representations and coping processes on the basis of data from thought listings in clinical and counseling psychology. The flux of thoughts, ideas, feelings, and images in waking states is so continuous and mercurial that it has been likened to the flow of a fast-running mountain stream.

40|$|Many feminist {{approaches}} to prostitution exist, {{all with the}} ultimate goal of eliminating gender inequality as a framework for their theories. Using data on street prostitution in Montreal and San Francisco collected by Frances Shaver and Martin Weinberg, the real lived experiences of sex workers are applied to three traditional feminist theories to test their <b>validity.</b> <b>Limitations</b> of the theories are identified by employing seven areas of examination. They are: (1) the history of the regulation of sexuality in western society; (2) the impact {{of the history of the}} regulation of prostitution in the West; (3) violence experienced on and off the job; (4) opportunities for other, more legitimate work; (5) whether or not prostitution is seen as a career; (6) sexual pleasure experienced on and off the job; and (7) sexual orientation. Postmodern Feminist Theory suggests a solution to these limitations. This involves an acknowledgment of the impact of the social context on the practice of prostitution as well as attention to the individual voices of sex workers including the voices of men. As a result, a redefinition of prostitution as sex work is proposed...|$|R

30|$|In {{performing}} {{comparisons between}} sites, particularly between different countries, {{it must be}} noted that not every clinical characteristic was measured in a consistent manner. In this study, there was a discrepancy in the measurement of rates of comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders. Though both groups used the same diagnostic criteria, the Argentinian site defined this variable as the current presence of anxiety or substance abuse disorders at the time of interview, while the North American site used a definition of lifetime presence of an anxiety or substance use disorder. Therefore, though the direct comparison of these rates between nationalities may have <b>validity</b> <b>limitations,</b> the overall rate of comorbidity within each sample and the comparison within each nationality between onset-age groups may still be of interest. Specifically, it is worth noting that almost 45 % of the patients from the United States suffered at one point in their lives from a comorbid substance use disorder. Further, almost 65 % of the North American cohort had a comorbid anxiety disorder prior to enrollment in the study. More investigation is warranted to analyze the rates of these comorbidities within subgroups of bipolar patients so as to assess the potential inclusion of these characteristics in diagnostic criteria (Vazquez et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{describes}} {{the results of}} the work made by the author at the Flight System Dynamic Institute (FSD) at the Technische Universität München (TUM). The aim of the work is the development and the implementation of an Atmosphere Model in MATLAB/Simulink to be used in a flight simulation device. The Atmosphere Model consists of four main subsystems: the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) Model, the Wind Model, the Turbulence Model and the Gust Model. A particular attention has been spent for the implementation of an additional model which allows {{to take into account the}} correlation that exists between the air velocities perceived in different points of the space: the Correlation Model. This model guarantees a more correct operation of the Turbulence Model in the case in which it is necessary to consider more aircraft flying in a restricted area. After a brief initial introduction, the general characteristics of the Atmosphere Model and of the Correlation Model are presented. In each chapter the subsystems of the Atmosphere Model are described in detail: requirements, modeling assumptions, scope of <b>validity,</b> <b>limitations,</b> algorithms for implementation, architecture specification, structural layout, verification plan and results. Afterwards, the Correlation Model is explained in detail. Finally, the last chapter is dedicated to the final assembly of the different parts...|$|R
