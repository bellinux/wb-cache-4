Abstract: The pear <b>leaf</b> <b>blister</b> <b>mite</b> can cause severe damage to pear leaves and young fruits in some regions. Due to hidden living inside <b>leaf</b> <b>blisters,</b> the <b>mites</b> are largely protected against the impact of plant protecting agents. Until now, treatments with mineral oil or rape oil in early spring, during the time when the mites leave their hibernation sites under the bud scales to invade the young leaves and blossoms, are the only possibility to control these mites in Swiss organic fruit growing. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of sulphur, mineral oil and Surround®WP applied after harvest during the time, when the <b>mites</b> leave their <b>blisters</b> and migrate to their hibernation sites. The different treatments were applied shortly after harvest to benefit from the mild temperatures in September. Counting the number of mites after dissection of the buds in laboratory in autumn and spring showed a good efficacy for all treatments. But the visual control in spring during bloom could not verify these results for all treatments. Only the sulphur-treated trees were virtually free of blisters in spring. With a corrected efficacy (Abbott’s formula) of 95...|$|R

40|$|The pear <b>leaf</b> <b>blister</b> <b>mite</b> Eriophyes pyri (Pagenstecher) causes {{severe damage}} to pear leaves and fruits. As mites are well {{sheltered}} {{from exposure to}} plant protection agents during summer and acaricide efﬁcacy is reduced when temperatures are low in early spring, autumn acaricide applications were evaluated to control mites as they migrate to their hibernation sites. Post-harvest sulphur and mineral oil treatments were applied in September 2003 and mites were monitored in the following spring. Only the sulphur treated trees were virtually free of blisters. Sulphur treatments showed an efﬁcacy of 95. 3 % (one application) to 99. 6 % (three applications), whereas, mineral oil treatments only had an efﬁcacy of 12. 8 % (one application) to 69. 6 % (three applications). That post harvest sulphur applications could decontaminate heavily infested orchards was possible was conﬁrmed by a large-plot trial in two orchards in 2004 / 2005...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Low venous tone (LVT) {{occurs when}} the veins in the lower limbs can no longer {{sufficiently}} pump enough blood back to the heart. Symptoms may include dull aching and cramping, itching or tingling in the calves, swelling redness or any colour changes as well as thickening of the skin in the lower limbs (Comerota, 2009). The most common indication of LVT is dilated veins known as varicose veins(Glovicski et al., 2011). LVT is a disorder found more commonly in females. Conventional treatment for LVT includes vein ligation or stripping, elastic compression, valve reconstruction and sclerotherapy venous bypass(Van den Bos et al., 2009). Amongst other treatment, exercise has also proven to be effective as it increases circulation, by increasing blood returning to the heart (Behrens and Michlovitz, 2006). A variety of herbal supplements have been proven {{to be safe and}} effective in the treatment of LVT. A combination complementary medication of red leaf extract, butcher’s broom extract, horse chestnut extract and vitamin B 6 has been formulated as an over-thecounter product in South Africa, to treat LVT without any anticipated adverse effects (Venavine-Nativa, 2014). Red <b>vine</b> <b>leaf</b> extract has also been proven to be useful in the treatment of LVT. Previous studies on the red <b>vine</b> <b>leaf</b> extract have shown that it is an effective and safe source of treatment (Kaluset al., 2004). Studies done on horse chestnut extract have stated that the extract increases venous tone and decreases capillary permeability, and butcher’s broom extract has been proven to be effective in the treatment of LVT (Lim and Davies, 2009). There are currently no studies done on the combination of red <b>vine</b> <b>leaf</b> extract, butcher’s broom extract, horse chestnut extract and vitamin B 6 on symptoms associated with LVT. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the efficacy of a combination complementary medication of red <b>vine</b> <b>leaf</b> extract (360 mg), horse chestnut extract (60 mg), butcher’s broom extract (35 mg) and pyridoxine (vitamin B 6) (3. 2 mg) in the treatment of symptoms associated with LVT, using a venous clinical severity score questionnaire (VCSS).

40|$|International audienceThe {{application}} of {{plant protection product}} has {{an important role in}} agricultural production processes. With current pesticides management, a huge amount of them are applied to worldwide orchards. In precision spraying, spray application efficiency depends on the pesticide application method, the phytosanitary product as well as the leaf surface properties. For environmental and economic reasons, the global trend is to reduce the pesticide application rate of the few approved active substances. Under these constraints, one of the challenges is to improve the efficiency of pesticide application. Different parameters can influence pesticide application such as nozzle types, liquid viscosity and leaf surface. In this paper, we focus on the <b>vine</b> <b>leaf</b> surface properties and discrimination between two kinds of vine leaves (Pinot and Chardonnay) in different stages of development for following their roughness growth. This discrimination allows studying the impact of the product behavior, and allows to adjusting the product viscosity and spraying parameters according to the roughness and the stage of <b>vine</b> <b>leaf</b> development. In this context, we propose to explore the performance of combination of Generalized Fourier Descriptor with Kernel Discriminant Analysis methods using neural network.
