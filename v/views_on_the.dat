5|$|Although Robert {{condemned}} Gilbert Porrée {{in conjunction}} with Peter Lombard, he {{did not agree with}} Lombard's Christology, or <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nature of Jesus Christ. Likewise, although he disagreed with some of Abelard's teachings, he defended Abelard against charges of heresy. Robert did, however, agree with some of Abelard's teachings and methods. The introduction to the Sententiae proclaims Robert's desire to harmonise the writings of two unnamed scholars, who have been identified by modern writers as Hugh of St Victor and Abelard.|$|E
5|$|As a preacher, he {{was rather}} eccentric. He {{was not very}} fluent and gifted as a speaker, but had the power of {{engaging}} the attention of his hearers, and was very successful and useful in a revival of religion. He entertained rather singular <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject of the orders in the ministry, objecting {{to the order of}} deacons, and holding that the eldership is the only true order. In consequence of these peculiar views, he would never consent to be ordained a deacon, and therefore never entered into orders at all.|$|E

40|$|Decision {{makers in}} ports and {{airports}} are working in an extremely complex environment. Decisions involve multiple actors, who all have a different <b>view</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> system under investigation, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness and desirability of possible outcomes of the decision making process. Simulation and visualization are two core technologies to support these complex decision making processes. One of the major challenges is to provide the variety of involved actors with visualizations that fit their <b>view</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> system. Two case {{studies show that the}} visualizations should be able to provide two <b>views</b> <b>on</b> decision making: a <b>view</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> system under investigation and a <b>view</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> multi-actor decision making process itself. This paper presents the requirements for a service-oriented and web-based simulation and visualization portal, which integrates both views. In cooperation with the Port of Rotterdam we are currently developing and testing a prototype implementation of the portal...|$|R
5|$|By the 1950s, Keynesian {{policies}} were adopted by {{almost the entire}} developed world and similar measures for a mixed economy were used by many developing nations. By then, Keynes's <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> economy had become mainstream in the world's universities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the developed and emerging free capitalist economies enjoyed exceptionally high growth and low unemployment. Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the 1950s and 1960s, when Keynes's influence was at its peak, appear in retrospect as a golden age of capitalism.|$|E
5|$|For years Peckham {{taught at}} Paris, {{where he was}} in contact {{with many of the}} leading {{scholars}} of his time, including Thomas Aquinas. He famously debated Aquinas on at least two occasions during 1269 and 1270, during which Peckham defended the conservative theological position, and Thomas put forth his <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soul. The Thomist doctrine of the unity of form was condemned after these debates. His theological works later were used by his pupil Roger Marston who in turn inspired Duns Scotus.|$|E
5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E

5|$|Historiographical {{studies of}} the May Revolution do not face many doubts or unknown details.

The modern version of events does not differ significantly from the contemporary one.|$|E
