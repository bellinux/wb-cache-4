25|$|Situational {{awareness}} or {{situation awareness}} (SA) {{is the perception}} of environmental elements and events with respect to time or space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status after some variable has changed, such as time, or some other <b>variable,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a predetermined event. It is also a field of study concerned with understanding of the environment critical to decision-makers in complex, dynamic areas from aviation, air traffic control, ship navigation, power plant operations, military command and control, and emergency services such as fire fighting and policing; to more ordinary but nevertheless complex tasks such as driving an automobile or riding a bicycle.|$|E
25|$|Notice {{that the}} end-loop marker {{specifies}} {{the name of}} the index variable, which must correspond to {{the name of the}} index variable in the start of the for-loop. Some languages (PL/I, FORTRAN 95 and later) allow a statement label on the start of a for-loop that can be matched by the compiler against the same text on the corresponding end-loop statement. Fortran also allows the EXIT and CYCLE statements to name this text; in a nest of loops this makes clear which loop is intended. However, in these languages the labels must be unique, so successive loops involving the same index variable cannot use the same text nor can a label be the same as the name of a <b>variable,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the index variable for the loop.|$|E
25|$|This {{statement}} {{helps to}} define temperature {{but it does}} not, by itself, complete the definition. An empirical temperature is a numerical scale for the hotness of a thermodynamic system. Such hotness may be defined as existing on a one-dimensional manifold, stretching between hot and cold. Sometimes the zeroth law is stated to include {{the existence of a}} unique universal hotness manifold, and of numerical scales on it, so as to provide a complete definition of empirical temperature. To be suitable for empirical thermometry, a material must have a monotonic relation between hotness and some easily measured state <b>variable,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> pressure or volume, when all other relevant coordinates are fixed. An exceptionally suitable system is the ideal gas, which can provide a temperature scale that matches the absolute Kelvin scale. The Kelvin scale is defined {{on the basis of the}} second law of thermodynamics.|$|E

2500|$|A common {{source of}} {{confusion}} {{in using the}} decibel occurs when deciding {{about the use of}} 10×log or 20×log. [...] In the original definition, it was a power measurement, and as employed in that context, the formulation 10×log should be used, as deci means one tenth. The user must be clear whether the quantity expressed is power or amplitude. It is useful to consider how power or energy is expressed, e.g., current×current×resistance, ×velocity×velocity×mass. [...] Where the power is a square function of a field <b>variable</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> voltage, current, or pressure), then 10×log is the correct expression for the square, or 20×log for the field variable itself.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} PID controller {{is the ability to}} use the three control terms of proportional, integral and derivative influence on the controller output to apply accurate and optimal control. The block diagram on the right shows the principles of how these terms are generated and applied. It shows a PID controller which continuously calculates an error value [...] as the difference between a desired setpoint SP= and a measured process variable PV=, and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms. The controller attempts to minimize the error over time by adjustment of a control <b>variable</b> , <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the opening of a control valve, to a new value determined by a weighted sum of the control terms.|$|E

Recently, the authors completed several studies {{of migration}} between Mountain States counties {{for the period}} 1985 - 1990. The current study begins {{the extension of the}} earlier research to the 1995 - 2000 period. The study examines the determinants of gross in-migration, gross out-migration, and net innligration by county between 1995 and 2000 and conlpares the results with those for the earlier period. In particular, it uses an econometric model to identify the importance of a variety of factors associated with countries in influencing the direction and size of Mountain States inter-county migration. Determinants of migration in the model include economic <b>variables</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> mean income, tax rates, unemployment rates, and poverty rates; demographic <b>variables</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> population density, urbanization, race, and ancestry; social <b>variables</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> crilne rates, family size, marriage status, and educational attainment; environmental <b>variables</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> air quality, insolation, and temperature; and geographic <b>variables</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> elevation and latitude...|$|R

The most common uses of correlation functions are when [...] and [...] describe the same <b>variable,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a spin-spin correlation function, or a particle position-position correlation function in an elemental liquid or a solid (often called a Radial distribution function or a pair correlation function). Correlation functions between the same random variable are autocorrelation functions. However, in statistical mechanics, not all correlation functions are autocorrelation functions. For example, in multicomponent condensed phases, the pair correlation function between different elements is often of interest. Such mixed-element pair correlation functions are an example of cross-correlation functions, as the random variables [...] and [...] represent the average variations in density as a function position for two distinct elements.|$|E
2500|$|As {{regards the}} {{geographical}} dialects of Malayalam, surveys conducted so far by the Department of Linguistics, University of Kerala restricted {{the focus of}} attention during a given study on one specific caste so as to avoid mixing up of more than one <b>variable</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> communal and geographical factors. Thus for examples, the survey of the Ezhava dialect of Malayalam, results of which have been published by the Department in 1974, has brought to light the existence of twelve major dialect areas for Malayalam, although the isoglosses are found to crisscross in many instances. [...] Sub-dialect regions, which could be marked off, were found to be thirty. This number is reported to tally approximately with the number of principalities that existed during the pre-British period in Kerala. In a few instances at least, {{as in the case of}} Venad, Karappuram, Nileswaram and Kumbala, the known boundaries of old principalities are found to coincide with those of certain dialects or sub-dialects that retain their individuality even today. This seems to reveal the significance of political divisions in Kerala in bringing about dialect difference.|$|E
