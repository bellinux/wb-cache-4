This paper presents an alternative approach, using horizontal boreholes for longwall goaf gas drainage. This horizontal drainage method has been trialled successfully at the Blakefield South mine.

A jet-slotting tool was used to cut four vertical slots through the casing about 1 ft below the coalbed. Even though stimulation treatment pressure was excessive, hydraulically induced channels were contained entirely within the target coal zone. Sand-filled, induced channels were horizontal, inclined, and vertical, and were propagated in directions similar to bedding planes, rock joint, and coal cleat directions measured in the mine. Variable gas flow rates, recorded during the productive life of the well, were attributed to chronic downhole pump malfunction and the slotted casing below the production zone.

50|$|Unfortunately in 2006, {{the lake}} {{experienced}} a drought. Survey conducted determined that heavy rainfall, in June and July 2006, led to flood, which removed sediments fills or organic wreckage in the caves. Average monthly rainfall at Hummingbird villages totaled 432 millimeter in June and 672 millimeter in July 2006. The rapid drainage {{of the lake}} still remains uncertain. It is believed {{that it may have}} resulted from failure of a plug in the lake bed cenote that eased near-vertical discharged into underlying cave channels. Although prior reports of rapid drainage of cenote did not exist, heavy rainfall may have increased pressure in the lake, but {{there is no evidence of}} a lake-bottom plug either prior to drainage or as a result of sediment erosion before refilling, and the reported depth of the cenote, which puts it well below sea level, suggests that <b>vertical</b> <b>drainage</b> is unlikely. Another caused could be that of an unblocking incident downstream, which lead the water to drain out. This explanation is said to be more probable. Meerman reported that local residents had previously noted sudden fluctuations in the lake and that turbidity appeared to have become less seasonally predictable, perhaps presaging later developments. Furthermore, local residents exclaimed that after the drainage of the lake there was a new, smaller lake on another part of the park, that could conclude to an underground connection.|$|E

Our results show that, in comparison to terrestrial basins, martian basins have more linear longitudinal profiles, more frequent existence of knickpoints, predominance of asymmetric location of the main stream in the basin, and smaller values of concavity exponent. This suggests a limited role for surface runoff on the global scale.
