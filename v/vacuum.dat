5|$|When the GWR {{was opened}} no trains in the United Kingdom were fitted with <b>vacuum</b> brakes, instead handbrakes were fitted to {{individual}} wagons and trains also conveyed brake vans where a guard had {{control of a}} screw-operated brake. The first goods wagons to be fitted with <b>vacuum</b> brakes were those that ran in passenger trains carrying perishable goods such as fish. Some ballast hoppers were given <b>vacuum</b> brakes in December 1903, and general goods wagons were constructed with them from 1904 onwards, although unfitted wagons (those without <b>vacuum</b> brakes) still formed {{the majority of the}} fleet in 1948 when the railway was nationalised {{to become a part of}} British Railways.|$|E

5000|$|Central <b>vacuums</b> can be {{equipped}} with either an electrical power brush or an air-driven power brush. The air-driven (or turbine) systems frequently are less expensive because they don’t require electrical wires for power to be run to each wall inlet. Turbine-driven brushes tend to be noisier than electric brushes; the noise from either is more noticeable {{in the absence of}} the [...] "vacuum whine" [...] produced by portable <b>vacuums.</b> Many users find that the high suction of central <b>vacuums</b> is more than sufficient by itself for most casual cleaning jobs, but reserve a powered brush tool for more difficult tasks.|$|R

5|$|In 1905 Einstein {{postulated}} {{from the}} outset that {{the speed of light}} in <b>vacuum,</b> measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the special theory of relativity, in which the speed of light in <b>vacuum</b> c featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Western Electric, the {{manufacturing}} division of AT, acquired {{the rights to}} the de Forest audion, the forerunner of the triode <b>vacuum</b> tube.

Western Electric then branched-out into developing uses for the <b>vacuum</b> tube including public address systems and an electrical recording system for the recording industry.

5|$|In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle {{suggested}} that nature abhors a <b>vacuum,</b> a principle that {{became known as}} the horror vacui. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE ontological argument by the Greek philosopher Parmenides, who denied the possible existence of a void in space. Based on this idea that a <b>vacuum</b> could not exist, in the West it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty. As late as the 17th century, the French philosopher René Descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{electrons}} {{moving in}} <b>vacuum</b> are termed free electrons. Electrons in metals also behave {{as if they}} were free. In reality the particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi-electrons—quasiparticles, which have the same electrical charge, spin, and magnetic moment as real electrons but might have a different mass. When free electrons—both in <b>vacuum</b> and metals—move, they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current, which generates a magnetic field. Likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field. These interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell's equations.|$|E
