50|$|Peridroma saucia, the pearly underwing or <b>variegated</b> <b>cutworm,</b> is {{a species}} of moth of the family Noctuidae. It is found in {{southern}} and central Europe, but is also found further north because of its migratory nature. Elsewhere in the Palearctic ecozone it is found in North Africa, Asia Minor, Russia (including the Russian Far East and Siberia), China, Taiwan and Japan. In the Nearctic ecozone it {{is found in the}} U.S. and southern Canada and in the Neotropic ecozone in Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Sri Lanka.|$|E

40|$|<b>Variegated</b> <b>cutworms</b> {{were exposed}} to bean plants in microcosms sprayed with pBR 322 -carrying strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella planticola, and Erwinia herbicola. The three {{bacterial}} species exhibited differential survival on leaves, in soil, and in guts and fecal pellets (frass) of the insects. High numbers of Enterobacter cloacae(pBR 322) were detected in all samples, while the other species were unable to establish residence in the insect. To {{assess the impact of}} this colonization on site-to-site transport of microorganisms, larvae were fed plants that had been sprayed with the bacteria and then were transferred to uninoculated plants. Cutworms were efficient carriers of Enterobacter cloacae(pBR 322), as indicated by its rapid appearance on uninoculated leaves and continued persistence in the insects for 3 days after transfer. Few Erwinia herbicola(pBR 322) and K. planticola(pBR 322) were obtained from larvae after transfer, although up to 10 (3) CFU/g were detected in soil and on plants. Differences in bacterial survival and growth were confirmed by incubating frass overnight and observing the change in population numbers. The proportion of total samples showing at least a 25 -fold increase during incubation was 68 % for Enterobacter cloacae(pBR 322), 39 % for K. planticola(pBR 322), and 0 % for Erwinia herbicola(pBR 322). Our results emphasize the role that cutworms and possibly other insects have in persistence and growth of microorganisms in the environment...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 A pest {{management}} program for <b>variegated</b> <b>cutworm</b> (VC), Peridroma saucia (Hubner), in Oregon peppermint was developed based on studies of pheromone trapping, sampling methods, and economic thresholds. Pheromone traps effectively trapped VC males and {{were used to}} reflect development and oviposition trends. Trap height was linearly correlated to moth catch (P < 0. 001); the largest catch occurred at a height of 80 cm. Male moths caught from mid-May through June, the number of egg masses collected on pheromone traps, and estimates of peppermint canopy height were used to estimate third and fourth instar larval densities by regression analysis (r² - 0. 64). A discriminant analysis based on similar independent variables correctly placed 16 out of 18 fields into two threshold density classes by a validation procedure. Parasitism rates of <b>variegated</b> <b>cutworm</b> and peppermint leaf consumption rates of parasitized and unparasitized larvae were measured. Instars 4 to 6 consumed an average of 184 cm², equivalent to 888 mg (dry weight) of peppermint foliage. Consumption by VC larvae parasitized by Meteorus communis (Cresson) was reduced by 93...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The {{toxicity}} of menthol, menthone, pulegone, limonene, and a-pinene, five monoterpenes found in peppermint (Mentha piperita L.), to the <b>variegated</b> <b>cutworm</b> (Peridroma saucia Hiibner) {{was characterized by}} in vivo and in vitro methods. Pulegone and menthone caused slower growth over six days when incorporated into an artificial diet and fed to fifth stadium larvae. Reduced growth was likely {{the result of the}} significant antifeedant properties observed for these compounds. Menthol, the dominant monoterpene found in peppermint leaves caused molting and pupation inhibition when incorporated in the diet over the dosage range comparable to that found in planta (0. 05 % to 0. 2 %). Limonene at a dose of 0. 2 % caused significant inhibition of pupation, but otherwise had little effect on growth or survival. a-Pinene had no effect on pupation, growth or survival over a dosage range of 0. 05 % to 0. 2 %. All five monoterpenes were metabolized in vitro by the cytochrome P- 450 dependent polysubstrate oxidase system, however piperonyl butoxide did not synergize their toxicity in vivo. Neonate larvae were more sensitive to oral administration of these monoterpenes than were fifth stadium larvae. These experiments suggest that monoterpenes in peppermint leaves could cause mortality to neonate <b>variegated</b> <b>cutworm</b> larvae...|$|E

There are dozens of species of moths that occur in Iowa in the spring, but only a few are potential pests. The eight most common moths collected during mid-May in a light trap in Ames were armyworm, black cutworm, celery looper, spotted cutworm, and <b>variegated</b> <b>cutworm.</b> All of these moths have multiple generations in the Midwest, so it is possible to see them again in mid- or late summer...|$|E
40|$|Trials were {{conducted}} at a commercial cut-chrysanthemum nursery in Mountain View, Hawaii to evaluate biological control of chrysanthemum insect pests. No chemical pesticides were applied throughout the growing season. Numerous parasitoids and predators of the agromyzid leafminer, Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess), the {{green peach aphid}} (GPA), Myzus persicae (Sulzer), and the <b>variegated</b> <b>cutworm</b> (VC), Peridroma saucia (Hubner), were recovered. The two dominant parasitoid species of L. trifolii, Diglyphus intermedius (Girault), and Ganaspidium utilis Beardsley, provided biological control during the first 7 to 9 weeks after planting when the unmarketed portion of the chrysanthemum foliage was growing. Additional biorational or chemical control methods are necessary for GPA. VC, and L. trifolii when their damage affects the marketable portion of the crop...|$|E

30|$|The <b>variegated</b> <b>cutworm</b> (VCW), Peridroma saucia (Hubner, 1808) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is {{a common}} {{polyphagous}} pest of many vegetable and field crops and found {{in many areas of}} the world (Rings et al., 1976 and Klein Koch and Waterhouse, 2000). VCW was first recorded in Europe in 1790 and then caused serious outbreaks in many countries throughout the Americas in 1841 (Capinera et al., 1988). The adults of these cutworms were discovered in 1967 in Turkey. At the present time, VCW is widely distributed in Turkey’s agricultural areas and it is one of the most abundant and damaging cutworm species of Turkey (Akdagcik and Ulusoy, 2007). VCW has a wide range of host plants which includes economic crops such as potato, tomato, corn, lettuce, carrot and sugar beet. VCW larvae do much damage to crops and cause considerable mortality to seedlings in the early growing season by cutting off the plant at the soil surface and feeding on the foliage of these crops (Capinera et al., 1988). Due to the high tolerance of VCW, repeated applications of conventional insecticides are widely used. Development of resistance and concerns over the destructive effects of chemicals to environmental and human safety have accelerated the development of alternative control methods for this pest (Yoshida, 2010).|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} from 1990 through 1992 to determine consumption rates and feeding duration of adult clover leaf weevils, Hypera punctata (F.), {{to characterize the}} injury potential of this species during alfalfa regrowth. Adults were fed for 29 d in 1990 and 18 d in both 1991 and 1992. The mean cumulative consumption per adult was 27. 2 ± 1. 6 cm 2 and 92. 7 ± 3. 5 mg dry weight in 1991 and 24. 6 ± 0. 9 cm 2 and 87. 5 ± 2. 9 mg dry weight in 1992. The mean cumulative consumption pattern was curvilinear for both dry weight and leaf area consumption. Most consumption was within 11 d of adult eclosion. The peak consumption rate occurred ~ 5 d after adult emergence. Because the highest consumption rates and the greatest percentage of defoliation were within the first 11 d of emergence, adult clover leaf weevils potentially can delay regrowth of alfalfa stubble when adult emergence coincides with the 1 st harvest. Further, because adult consumption patterns between clover leaf weevils and alfalfa weevils are similar, alfalfa stubble defoliation thresholds developed for alfalfa weevils and cutworms {{also can be used}} for clover leaf weevils. Injury equivalents (injury by 1 species in terms of another species) are determined for adult clover leaf weevils, larval <b>variegated</b> <b>cutworm,</b> Peridroma saucia (Hubner), and larval and adult alfalfa weevils, Hypera postica (Gyllenhal) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the investigation of}} the bioactivity of triterpenoids, limonoids and spiro-triterpenoids, isolated from the order of the Rutales. The focus of this research has been towards the development of botanical insecticides with non-neurotoxic modes of action in insects. It follows the recent development of Neem (Azadirachta indica, Meliaceae) as a botanical insecticide containing a limonoid azadirachtin as its main active compound. Because so few Meliaceae members have been examined for insecticidal activity the project was initiated by the screening of over sixty ethanol extracts of various parts of twenty species (collected from Costa Rica and the Tropical Museum in Miami, Florida) for bioactivity against the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) and the <b>Variegated</b> <b>cutworm</b> (Peridroma saucia). The data suggest {{that a majority of the}} extracts studied inhibited growth significantly; some are more active than neem leaf extracts. Swietenia mahogani bark, Trichilia glabra bark, T. hirta leaves, T. americana bark, T. trifolia wood, T. pleana and Azadirachta indica wood showed potent activity against the cutworm. Ruptiliocarpon caracolito bark, Cedrela odorata leaves, Aphanamixis polystachys wood, T. glabra wood and T. pleana bark showed good activity against the corn borer larvae. Bioassay guided fractionation of the most active crude extract, the bark of Ruptiliocarpon caracolito, has resulted in the isolation of six very novel spiro-CD-triterpenoids, the spirocaracolitones. The spirocaracolitones, at 100 ppm, were screened for antifungal activity against Fusarium using a hyphal growth bioassay. After 48 h a high degree of inhibition of growth (59 - 79...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 A {{study of}} mortality, food consumption, food utilization, and {{polyhedral}} production following single and simultaneous {{challenges of the}} <b>variegated</b> <b>cutworm,</b> Peridroma saucia (Hubner), with DDT and a nuclear polyhedrosis virus was made. Fourth instar larvae were challenged topically with three levels of DDT and per os with three levels of virus, one level in each case being a zero control. This design provided nine different treatments, four involving dual challenges, and five involving single or zero level controls. X² tests were used to compare total mortality, DDT mortality, and virus mortality in each combination treatment to expected mortalities which were computed from the single dose treatment results. Results indicated {{that the effects of}} virus and DDT were additive. DDT activity was affected by the presence of virus in only two of 12 combinations studied. In both cases a significant synergistic response was noted. No definite trends over all levels tested were apparent in the data. Virus mortality was significantly increased in one combination and was reduced in another. In both cases, the differences are questionable due to the low numbers of individuals involved. All other combinations resulted in virus or DDT deaths which would be expected if each were acting independently. Single or combined treatments killed no more males than females. Consumption and utilization of a meridic diet were measured gravimetrically. Different treatments had little effect on consumption or utilization by larvae of the same ultimate fates. Healthy larvae, however, consumed six times as much food as virus killed larvae and 100 times as much as DDT killed larvae. Healthy insects digested a lower percentage of the food consumed than did infected or poisoned larvae, but they converted more of what they did digest into tissue, while sick larvae utilized more as energy. Polyhedral production by infected larvae was measured in each group. Production dropped in the combination treatments as DDT dosage increased and as virus dosage decreased, indicating the need for careful consideration of goals when applying these agents in the field...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of alfalfa regrowth to actual and simulated stubble damage by the <b>variegated</b> <b>cutworm</b> (VCW), Peridroma saucia (Hubner), was investigated. A laboratory {{study found that}} most larvae exhibited 7 larval stages. Development by these larvae took 32. 8 days at 24 (DEGREES) C, during which 442. 2 mg of alfalfa foliage was consumed;The effect of the duration of a complete suppression of regrowth on alfalfa productivity was studied using a surrogate defoliation technique. Complete regrowth suppression for 1 and 3 days did not significantly affect alfalfa regrowth. Delays of 7 and 11 days retarded plant development and suppressed the crop growth rate (CGR) of subsequent regrowth. Most of the reduction in CGR {{was caused by a}} decline in the growth rate of support (stem) structures. Leaf-weight and leaf-area growth rates were not significantly affected. The differential {{response of}} component growth rates resulted in an increase in the leaf area ratio, leaf weight ratio, and specific leaf area of regrowth;A second study found that stubble damage by various densities of VCW larvae produced the same general effects on alfalfa growth and partitioning that simulated defoliation produced. The effects, however, were significant in all years only for densities of 6 and greater larvae/ 0. 1 m(2 ̆ 72). These densities were large enough to completely suppress regrowth in most years for 10 to 15 days;The results of both studies indicated that plants minimized the adverse effects of stubble injury by maintaining growth rates of leaf weight and area at the expense of support-structure growth. A hypothesis based on the depletion of stored carbohydrate reserves was proposed to explain the changes observed in alfalfa regrowth;A replacement-feed cost analysis was conducted for both studies. Depending on commodity price and control costs, stubble damage was economic for a harvest system based on cutting at first bloom when regrowth was suppressed completely for 4. 4 to 7. 5 days or when densities of newly-molted, last-stage larvae reached 2. 8 to 4. 8 larvae/ 0. 1 m(2 ̆ 72). Action levels were reduced by approximately one-half if cutting occurred based on calendar-date. A management program for VCW in alfalfa was developed using these results, and guidelines for the management of other stubble defoliators also were proposed...|$|E
