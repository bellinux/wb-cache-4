40|$|Tutorialpg. 167 One of the {{foremost}} concerns facing pump users today is that of rotordynamics. As pump speeds have increased to provide improved efficiencies and lighter packages, rotordynamics has assumed a significantly greater role in determining pump reliability. Pump rotordynamic problems often manifest themselves as shaft fatigue failures and wear/failures of bearings, seals, and impellers. The aim {{of this paper is}} to provide users with a basic understanding of rotordynamics and a practical design procedure that can be used to ensure that their pumping systems will not encounter major difficulties in the field. Since pumps are inherently hydraulic devices, their rotordynamic behavior is considerable different from that of their pneumatic turbomachinery counterparts like compressors and turbines. Accordingly, the paper concentrates on these differences and how to handle them in the design process. The paper begins with a review of the fundamentals of rotordynamics and the types of analyses that should be employed in the design process. Guidelines are provided for modelling and for performing rotordynamic staples such as undamped critical speed, unbalance response, and damped natural frequency/stability analysis. The generation of a critical speed map and the tremendous amount of information that can be gleaned from it is also described in detail. Attention is then turned to the factors that render the rotordynamic analysis of pumps significantly different from that of pneumatic turbomachinery. First and foremost is the fact that the mass of fluid contained in hydraulic machines is significant compared with that of the rotor. The ?wet? critical speeds of a pump are usually considerably different from their ?dry? counterparts. A major factor in this difference is that locations of close-clearance annular fits, such as at seals, balance pistons, wear rings, and impellers, generate significant fluid-structure interaction forces that must be incorporated into the model as dynamic stiffness, damping, and mass coefficients. The presence of these additional supports can generate rotor instabilities and introduce errors into the calculation of journal bearing dynamic coefficients. Additionally, the liquid mass entrained within impellers can produce a ?hydraulic unbalance? which is often larger than the mechanical unbalance and, thus, must be accounted for in response calculations. Finally, rotors immersed in liquid experience a fluid coupling with their casings that is not accounted for in conventional calculations. The unique problems often associated with <b>vertical</b> <b>pumps</b> are then explored in detail. Since the ?casing? for many <b>vertical</b> <b>pumps</b> is a cantilevered flexible column, rotor-casing interactions must be accounted for by a means such as multilevel modelling. In addition, due to the absence of a gravity load, <b>vertical</b> <b>pump</b> <b>bearing</b> are usually lightly loaded, rendering them especially susceptible to instability problems. Finally, the use of process fluids to lubricate journal bearings often requires nonstandard means for determination of the dynamic coefficients. The paper concludes with a generic step-by-step procedure that users can utilize to analyze any pumping machine they might encounter...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Vertical</b> <b>pumps</b> have {{intrinsically}} weak {{structures for}} vibration resonance {{because of their}} long slender shapes. Therefore, {{it is important to}} estimate the vibration characteristics of a <b>vertical</b> <b>pump</b> analytically and/or experimentally before its final installation. Sometimes, however, unexpected resonances arise after the installation. The unexpected resonance is found to be due to the difference between the boundary condition of a <b>vertical</b> <b>pump</b> for rigid-foundation test operation and for flexible-foundation real operation. In order to examine this problem and quantify the effect of the foundation condition on the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the entire pump assembly, amathematical model using a Euler–Bernoulli beam with a flexible foundation is presented. This model combines the lower and upper parts of a ver-tical pump, distinguishing it from previous analytical models. Experiments and simulations have been performed to validate this mathematical model and to evaluate the effect of foun-dation stiffness on vibration behaviour. Parametric studies have also been carried out to inves-tigate the effects of other design variables on the dynamic characteristics of the pumps and to propose design strategies for improvement in the dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 107 The use of {{long shaft}} <b>vertical</b> <b>pumps</b> is common {{practice}} in the nuclear waste processing industry. Unfortunately, when such pumps employ plain cylindrical journal bearings, they tend to suffer from rotordynamic instability problems due to the inherent lightly-loaded condition that the vertical orientation places on the bearings. This paper describes {{a case study in}} which the authors utilized rotordynamic analysis and experimental vibration analysis to diagnose such a problem and designed replacement tilting-pad bearings to solve the problem. The subject pumps are 45 foot long <b>vertical</b> <b>pumps</b> used for mixing nuclear waste in one million gallon tanks. Each pumping system consists of an induction motor driven by a variable frequency drive, a segmented pump shaft with a centrifugal impeller at the bottom, and a pipe column that surrounds the pump shaft and is suspended into the tank. The column is filled with water that serves as the lubricant for the eight plain cylindrical journal bearings that support the pump shaft. Unfortunately, these pumps have been plagued with vibration related problems, such as bearing and seal failures, ever since they were commissioned. In order to evaluate the problem, the pump shaft and column were instrumented with vibration transducers, and vibration testing was performed. This testing revealed that subsynchronous whirling, at approximately one-half the running speed, was the primary culprit responsible for the failures. In an effort to understand the cause of the observed vibrations, a two-level rotordynamic model of the pump shafting and column was constructed. This rotordynamic model, like those for many <b>vertical</b> <b>pumps,</b> was far from routine. The rotordynamic analysis, which is described in detail, then successfully confirmed that the problem was subsynchronous whirling due to rotordynamic instability. This analysis was then used to guide the design of tilting-pad bearings employing offset pivots and geometric preload to replace the original plain cylindrical bearings and, thereby, resolve the instability problem. The plain cylindrical bearings were removed from a <b>pump,</b> tilting-pad <b>bearings</b> were installed, and subsequent testing verified the predicted vibration reduction. Accordingly, the application of tilting-pad bearings, whose design is described in detail, was conclusively shown to be an effective solution for this specific problem...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate and enhance dynamic performance for a <b>vertical</b> <b>pumping</b> unit. The original electric motor of the pump unit had been replaced by another one different in design and weights. Vibration has been increased greatly after installing the new motor. Consequently, it is necessary to estimate the change in the vibration characteristics owing to the difference in the boundary conditions of the new motor. Measured vibration levels and frequency analysis were dangerous at 1 × due to resonance problem. Finite Element Analysis was used to model the motor structure in order to find its natural frequencies and mode shapes. The results confirm that the third natural frequency is very close to 1 × operating speed with deviation about 1 %. To solve the resonance problem, it was recommended to increase the structure stiffness. The results after modifications confirmed that the overall vibration level decreases by 89 %.
