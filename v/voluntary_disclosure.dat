25|$|Coming out of {{the closet}} is the source of other gay slang {{expressions}} related to <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosure</b> or lack thereof. LGBT people who have already revealed or no longer conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity are out, i.e. openly LGBT. Oppositely, LGBT people who have yet to come out or have opted not to do so are labelled as closeted or being in the closet. Outing is the deliberate or accidental disclosure of an LGBT person's sexual orientation or gender identity, without their consent. By extension, outing oneself is self-disclosure. Glass closet means the open secret of when public figures' being LGBT is considered a widely accepted fact even though they have not officially come out.|$|E

40|$|Using the {{accounting}} valuation model proposed by Feltham and Ohlson [1995], {{this study examines}} firm valuation attributable to (1) the joint effects of accounting conservatism and extent of <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosures</b> on firm valuations and (2) the joint effects of accounting conservatism and life-cycle stages. ^ Although prior studies have concluded that <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosures</b> provide value-relevant information not captured in the reported financial numbers, these studies were conducted assuming the credibility of <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosures</b> was similar across all firms. Research has also concluded {{that the value of}} information is directly related to its precision (inverse of variability) or the credibility of its source. However, all <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosures</b> are not equally credible, and <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosures</b> from sources with questionable credibility are likely to have minimal or no effect on firm valuation. Therefore, studies on the value-relevance of <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosures</b> should be examined jointly with their credibility. Since prior studies have not considered this previously omitted variable, the findings of those studies are not generalizable to other situations. ^ Unlike reported financial numbers, <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosures</b> are not audited nor have an ex ante governance mechanism. Investors 2 ̆ 7 perception of the credibility of voluntarily disclosed information is likely derived from their perception of the credibility of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s other information. When a firm follows conservative accounting procedures, investors are likely to regard the firm as being conservative not only in preparing financial numbers but also in releasing <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosures.</b> Investors will give more credibility to those firms 2 ̆ 7 <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosures,</b> as compared to firms that are not deemed as conservative. Therefore, the effects on firm value will be greater for those firms whose disclosures are considered more credible. This study predicts for firms following conservative accounting procedures, the impact of <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosures</b> on market values will be greater than those firms following less conservative accounting procedures. Results confirm that accounting conservatism enhances the credibility of a firm 2 ̆ 7 s <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosures</b> to investors, resulting in greater value relevance of the <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosures.</b> ^ Prior empirical research also suggests that the value relevance of financial numbers is affected by firms 2 ̆ 7 underlying economic attributes. Furthermore, Feltham and Ohlson [1995] describe theoretically that, under conservative accounting, the expected growth in net assets affects firm values. This study predicts that the effect of accounting conservatism on equity market value will be different for firms with different economic attributes. This study uses a firm 2 ̆ 7 s life-cycle stage as the surrogate representing the firm 2 ̆ 7 s economic attributes. The effect of life-cycle stage, as perceived by market investors, on market values and the interaction between accounting conservatism and life-cycle stage are examined. The results suggest that the impact of accounting conservatism on firm valuation interacts with a firm 2 ̆ 7 s life-cycle stage. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the strategic and potentially legitimising nature of voluntary environmental reporting. First, the thesis {{examines the}} relationship between emission levels on the National Pollutant Inventory and the quantity of total <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>disclosures,</b> <b>voluntary</b> emission <b>disclosures</b> and positive <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>disclosures</b> in annual reports. Second, an examination {{of changes in the}} quantity of disclosures discussing compliance with the National Pollutant Inventory and/or disclosures concerning pollution emissions is undertaken. Taking into consideration the findings relating to the strategic nature of <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosures,</b> the thesis then examines the potential of such disclosures to impact upon the usefulness of mandatory annual report disclosure requirements. This is undertaken by investigating whether significant differences exist between environmental disclosure practices in the voluntary sections of annual reports for corporations reporting non-compliance, and those not reporting non-compliance, in the directors&# 039; report pursuant with the requirements of s. 299 (1) (f) of the Corporations Law. The findings suggest that, for the sample corporations, a change in environmental regulation may have been an impetus for changes in <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>disclosure</b> practices in annual reports. Disclosures are identified as being discretionary, and potentially reactive to changes in environmental regulation, with {{a significant increase in the}} quantity of <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosures</b> relating to the National Pollutant Inventory and in the number of corporations making <b>voluntary</b> emission <b>disclosures</b> during the period. Hence, <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosures,</b> although discretionary, may provide some indication of the corporation&# 039;s actual environmental activities and provides some support for industry arguments to maintain a <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>disclosure</b> system. A comparison of the quantity and nature of <b>voluntary</b> <b>disclosures</b> for corporations required to report non-compliance with, and those reporting no non-compliance with, environmental regulations in the directors&# 039; report found no significant differences in disclosure practices between the two groups; that is, in contrast to the findings of previous research, those reporting non-compliance had no higher propensity for either greater quantities of <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>disclosures</b> or positive <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>disclosures.</b> The findings suggest that the limitations faced by s. 299 (1) (f) in its early years may have resulted in it not being perceived as a legitimacy threat by the sample corporations or as a lesser threat than others such as the NPI. Therefore, questions remain as to whether the section is able to produce the outcomes proposed at its inception. Overall, taking into consideration the discretionary nature of <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>disclosures,</b> and the limitations of s. 299 (1) (f), concern remains as to the quality of the Australian annual report environmental reporting system and the potential for the existence of <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>disclosures</b> in the annual report to reduce the usefulness of a mandatory disclosure system to users. These findings suggest a need for further research into the effect of both mandatory and <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>disclosures</b> on users&# 039; perceptions of corporate environmental performance...|$|R
