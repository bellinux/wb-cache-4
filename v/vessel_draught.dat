40|$|The {{purpose of}} this final year project is to design a sailing vessel which is able to ride seas around the world, except austral seas. The main concept is to imagine an {{environmentally}} friendly powered boat first by reducing the entreaty of the generator by using solar cells,photovoltaic panels and horizontal or vertical wind turbines. The coupling of both systems,(sun and wind), will produce enough energy for the comfort of life. This concept boat leads directly to a coastal laboratory for primary research sailing boat. The vessel should have comfortable accommodations for 2 skippers and 4 scientists (accounting that the scientists onboard are already experimented sailing people). The vessel will include glass panels under the hull working with structural and moving doors once arrived in shallow water. The role envisaged of the vessel should include research works at sea such as archeology and oceanography in shallow water. (Marine wild life logging, photography, filming, primary analysis and scuba-diving activity). The vessel will {{also be used as}} a form of transport for a light amount of samples so the vessel would include a crane to carry objects out of water, and as a base for land research expeditions into areas which are difficult to access and which needs relatively small <b>vessel</b> <b>draught</b> to be investigated.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{high-speed}} cargo vessel could soon be taking some of the burden from our roads. The Partial Air Cushion Supported Catamaran, or PACSCAT, is being developed {{with the aid of}} funding from the EU Growth programme. With rapid growth in freight logistics markets throughout Europe, and an already congested land-based infrastructure, expansion of waterborne modes is considered essential. It is expected that PACSCAT vessels will {{play a major role in}} achieving this goal. The high speed, low wash, variable draught vessel is designed for operations on the Rhine and Danube rivers. At a design speed of around 20 kt (37 km / hr), the vessel will be capable of making the 2, 200 km trip from Constanza to Passau in three days as opposed to the current journey time of seven days by barge, thus competing directly with road transport. The payload capacity will be in the order of 2000 t, which is equivalent to around 45 truckloads. The <b>vessel</b> <b>draught</b> can be adjusted from 2. 5 m to as low as 1. 5 m in order to cope with shallow conditions and air draught can be similarly altered to allow for bridge height limitations. The air cushion is contained between the sidehulls and end seals, and is generated by installed lift fans. This reduces the propulsion power requirements and the wash generated, which is especially important in operations along waterways. It will be designed to operate utilising existing berthing/loading facilities. This paper reports the results of the current EU funded project which is developin...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{positioning}} of surface vessels involves control of vessels with changing dynamics, shifting conditions, for different operational tasks. A controller with fixed controller parameters cannot have an optimal performance {{for all these}} different cases, and autotuning of the controller would be very valuable. However, dynamic positioning is a complex task, and thus automatic tuning of a dynamic positioning controller is not less so. This thesis does not solve all problems that comes with autotuning of dynamic positioning systems, but it gives {{an overview of the}} problem and presents a novel performance index for station keeping. Furthermore, a hybrid controller that can function as a first step in solving the autotuning problem is suggested. The hybrid controller has a fixed controller structure and is a combination of a gain-scheduling controller and an adaptive controller. The adaptive controller is used in an idle (training/learning) mode to populate a look-up table with controller parameters, while the gain-scheduling controller work as a fast-changing dynamical controller, using the controller parameters stored in the look-up table. Each controller parameter set in the look-up table is optimized according to a vessel operational condition, which is defined as a function of environmental conditions (wind, waves, ocean current), <b>vessel</b> <b>draught,</b> and water depth. Optimization of the controller parameters for the different vessel operational conditions is carried out by two different autotuning methods; a genetic algorithm and a rule-based algorithm. Both of these autotuning methods are optimizing the controller gains in a nonlinear PID-controller. The performance index and the two autotuning methods are implemented in Matlab/Simulink, where simulation tests are performed for a 3 DOF mathematical model of a supply vessel. The test scenario includes two different vessel operational conditions, where the controller has been automatically tuned both for minimal position and heading deviation as well as weighting on the use of forces. A comparison of the two autotuning methods is also performed and finally a discussion of the behaviour and tuning of the suggested performance index is carried out. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a case study}} of a potential close quarters situation between three vessels, viewed as a case of sociotechnical work and analysed using a model of navigational assistance developed using the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). A large bulk carrier finds itself in a potential close quarters situation with two other vessels near the entrance to a deep water channel. Uncertainty regarding the <b>vessel's</b> <b>draught</b> restricts its manoeuvrability, increasing the risk of collision and grounding. Analysis of this case illustrates how a potentially unsafe situation may be identified, communicated and resolved by the interaction between vessels and shore, thereby improving safety in everyday operations. Furthermore, it shows how FRAM may be used effectively both for modelling a work practice on a generic level, and also for understanding how work is conducted safely in a specific situation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} into the simulation of ship manoeuvring in restricted waters; in particular ship squat and ship-bank interaction. A time-domain mathematical model has been developed to predict unsteady squat and dynamic acceleration effects for a vessel travelling in non-uniform water depth. A quasi-steady approach was adopted, where the prediction at each time step is based on steady-state heave force and pitch moment in uniform water depth. A comprehensive set of model scale experiments was conducted to investigate squat in both uniform and non-uniform water depth. Regression analysis was performed on the uniform water depth test data to develop empirical equations for steady-state squat, which were used as input to the mathematical model. The equations apply to a full form vessel and are dependent on under keel clearance parameters, channel width parameters and depth Froude number. Empirical correction factors were also developed to estimate the effect of propulsion on squat. Good correlation was observed between predictions from the squat mathematical model and steady-state sinkage measurements {{for a wide range of}} water depth to draught ratios. Predictions from the mathematical model were also compared with unsteady sinkage measurements on a ship model travelling over a simplified ramp bank. The general trend of the predicted unsteady sinkage was reasonable, improving the realism of simulation for abrupt changes in water depth compared to predictions where acceleration effects in the vertical plane are neglected. However, the maximum unsteady sinkage was not always predicted accurately, which may be attributable to limitations and assumptions associated with the technique. A comprehensive model scale experiment program was conducted to investigate ship-bank interaction. The following parameters were systematically varied for three different hull forms: flooded bank height, water depth, bank slope, lateral ship to bank distance, vessel speed and <b>vessel</b> <b>draught.</b> The results from these experiments were used to develop a bank parameter to estimate the effects of lateral surface piercing and flooded banks. This parameter was utilised in regression analyses to develop empirical formulae for steady-state bank induced sway force and yaw moment. The empirical formulae were validated against independent model scale measurements from literature and showed reasonable agreement for a range of cases. The formulae were then incorporated into the existing mathematical model of the AMC ship-handling simulator. The quasi-steady technique was used to predict the path of a vessel for a real-life manoeuvre where bank induced yaw moment is used to aid a turn. The proposed bank effect simulation method was found to provide a satisfactory solution to the problem of ship-bank interaction simulation...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{factor that}} contributed to the {{capsizing}} was the [...] "squat effect". When a vessel is under way, the movement under it creates low pressure, which has the effect of increasing the <b>vessel's</b> <b>draught.</b> In deep water the effect is small but in shallow water it is greater, because as the water passes underneath it moves faster and causes the draught to increase. This reduced the clearance between the bow doors and water line to between 1.5 m and 1.9 m. After extensive tests, the investigators found that when the ship travelled at a speed of 18 kn, the wave was enough to engulf the bow doors. This caused a [...] "step change": if the ship had been sailing at less than 18 knots and not in shallow water, people on the car deck would probably have had time to notice the bow doors were open and close them.|$|R

40|$|Water {{transport}} {{could be}} {{the backbone of the}} future European combined transport system. The development of the cargo transport in river traffic depends directly on technical-exploitative characteristics of the network of inland waterways. Research of navigational abilities of inland waterways always comes before building ships or making a transport schedule. It is known that the size of the <b>vessel’s</b> <b>draught</b> (T) is usually the limiting value in project tasks and it depend on the depth of the waterway or certain ports condition. This is the reason why navigation characteristics of rivers have to be determined as precise as possible, especially from the aspect of determination of the possible <b>draught</b> of <b>vessels.</b> Unfortunately, risks in water transport are perhaps an under researched area and consequently, this article outlines a rationale, why it is necessary to develop competence about risk in water transport. Climate changes require special attention and global monitoring. Current risk assessment methods for water transport just consider some dramatic events.
