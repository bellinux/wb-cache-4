However, {{non-human}} plural nouns are grammatically considered to be feminine singular. Furthermore, a verb in a verb-initial sentence is marked as singular regardless of its semantic number when the subject of the verb is explicitly mentioned as a noun. Numerals between three and ten show [...] "chiasmic" [...] agreement, in that grammatically masculine numerals have feminine marking and vice versa.|$|E

A corpus has been compiled from four Pakistani English newspapers i. e. The Dawn, The News, The Nation and The Express Tribune. A sample size of 240 columns (120 both by male and female writers) has been compiled in this study. This research highlights the implicit function of parts of speech in Pakistani English newspapers. These parts of speech have been limited to nouns, <b>pronouns,</b> <b>verbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>adjectives.</b> It explores how male and female writings differ {{in the use of}} parts of speech in Pakistani English newspaper columns and to uncover the manipulation through its uses...|$|R
40|$|Using hidden Markov models (HMM's), an unobstrusive single view {{camera system}} is {{developed}} that can recognize hand gestures, namely, {{a subset of}} American Sign Language (ASL). Previous systems have concentrated on finger spelling or isolated word recognition, often using tethered electronic gloves for input. We achieve high recognition rates for full sentence ASL using only visual cues. A forty word lexicon consisting of personal <b>pronouns,</b> <b>verbs,</b> nouns, <b>and</b> <b>adjectives</b> is used to create 494 randomly constructed five word sentences that are signed by the subject to the computer. The data is separated into a 395 sentence training set and an independent 99 sentence test set. While signing, the 2 D position, orientation, and eccentricity of bounding ellipses of the hands are tracked in real time {{with the assistance of}} solidly colored gloves. Simultaneous recognition and segmentation of the resultant stream of feature vectors occurs five times faster than real time on an HP 735. With a strong [...] ...|$|R
30|$|Obviously {{much depends}} on how one defines presupposition. An {{anonymous}} referee has recommended that I define adposition. In my view this is not crucial, {{since most of the}} adpositions which I discuss are not controversial with respect to which word class they belong to. In Libert (2013) I provide a detailed examination of some words whose status as adpositions is less clear, and I show how difficult the classification of many putative adpoisitions is. For English, Latin, and some other languages, one might define adpositions as words which take no inflection (differentiating them from nouns, <b>pronouns,</b> <b>verbs,</b> <b>adjectives,</b> <b>and</b> adverbs) but which assign case to their complements (differentiating them from conjunctions and interjections). However, this will not work as a universal definition, as there are languages which arguably have inflected adpositions. I will make the somewhat controversial assumption that some sequences of words (e.g. instead of) are also adpositions; I am certainly not the only one assuming this, but to accommodate such items, my definition of adposition would have to be modified. For one discussion (among many) of defining adposition see Lunggren (1951).|$|R
40|$|So far, {{not much}} {{research}} {{has been carried out}} on the morphological description of the Algerian Arabic dialect, applying the principles of modern structural linguistics. Algeria, a North African country, has many dialects spoken in the various regions of its vast geographical area, including non-Arabic dialects. This paper deals with one of these dialects, namely the Arabic Algiers Urban Dialect (AAUD). As the name indicates, it is the dialect of the capital city. This study focuses on the inflectional and derivational grammatical (morphological) formations found in the Algiers Arabic Urban dialect (AAUD), based on the systematic analysis, applying the Replacive Morpheme, Root-and-Pattern system, Item-and-Process (IP) and the Item-and-Arrangement morphological principles with suitable conditionings and illustrations. Though there are variations found within this dialect, no attempt has been made to stratify the differences due to social variables. The present paper presents the important aspects of different parts of speech in morphology, including nouns (<b>and</b> <b>pronouns),</b> <b>verbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>adjectives.</b> Since we are dealing with an Arabic dialect, a brief overview of the Standard Arabic language structure is presented first (with root and pattern system) along with definitions and exemplification. This is followed by the sections on verbal derivations and inflections. The sections dealing with nouns, <b>adjectives,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pronouns</b> follow consecutively...|$|R

40|$|Originally {{inspired}} by categorical quantum mechanics (Abramsky and Coecke, LiCS' 04), the categorical compositional distributional model of natural language meaning of Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark provides a conceptually motivated procedure {{to compute the}} meaning of a sentence, given its grammatical structure within a Lambek pregroup and a vectorial representation of the meaning of its parts. The predictions of this first model have outperformed that of other models in mainstream empirical language processing tasks on large scale data. Moreover, just like CQM allows for varying the model in which we interpret quantum axioms, one can also vary the model in which we interpret word meaning. In this paper we show that further developments in categorical quantum mechanics are relevant to natural language processing too. Firstly, Selinger's CPM-construction allows for explicitly taking into account lexical ambiguity and distinguishing between the two inherently different notions of homonymy and polysemy. In terms of the model in which we interpret word meaning, this means a passage from the vector space model to density matrices. Despite this change of model, standard empirical methods for comparing meanings can be easily adopted, which we demonstrate by a small-scale experiment on real-world data. This experiment moreover provides preliminary evidence of the validity of our proposed new model for word meaning. Secondly, commutative classical structures as well as their non-commutative counterparts that arise {{in the image of the}} CPM-construction allow for encoding relative <b>pronouns,</b> <b>verbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>adjectives,</b> <b>and</b> finally, iteration of the CPM-construction, something that has no counterpart in the quantum realm, enables one to accommodate both entailment and ambiguity...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aimed studying {{comparison of}} dialect that can contribute toward community development especially in language usage, because they sometimes have similar and different meanings, sound or pronunciation, {{and even their}} form. This research observed the patois dialect used by Paser Pematang and Paser Telake people in Kabupaten Paser Tanah Grogot Kaltim, because the researcher is very familiar with those dialects. The focus {{of this research was}} to know the characteristics of dialect varieties, the similarities and the differences of vocabularies used by Paser Pematang and Paser Telake and also the factors which influenced them. The research design used in this study was descriptive qualitative, the subject of this study consisted of 20 people as informants. In collecting the data, the researcher used an observation and interview. The observation was used to know the condition and the relationship of society in Paser Pematang and Paser Telake in using the dialect. Meanwhile, researcher used unstructured interviews by asking the participant about the vocabulary in order to confirm the data. In this research, the researcher found similarities and differences between dialect of Paser Pematang and Paser Telake. Based on the observation and interview from informants, the researcher found similarities of their dialect from the way they spoke. The researcher grouped based on words classes; they are noun, <b>pronoun,</b> <b>verb,</b> <b>and</b> <b>adjective.</b> The researcher also finds the differences of their dialect from the way they spoke.
