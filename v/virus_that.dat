5|$|As {{an example}} of viral classification, the chicken pox virus, {{varicella}} zoster (VZV), belongs to the order Herpesvirales, family Herpesviridae, subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, and genus Varicellovirus. VZV is in Group I of the Baltimore Classification {{because it is a}} dsDNA <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> does not use reverse transcriptase.|$|E
5|$|Maillard et al. and Li et al. provide {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} a functional antiviral RNAi pathway in mammalian cells. Other functions for RNAi in mammalian viruses also exist, such as miRNAs expressed by the herpes <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> may act as heterochromatin organization triggers to mediate viral latency.|$|E
5|$|Baris stubbornly holds Kirk {{responsible}} for this apparent fiasco, and Koloth additionally demands an apology from Kirk after some of the Enterprise crew are provoked into a brawl with the Klingons in the station's bar. However, the tribbles reveal {{the identity of a}} Klingon agent masquerading as a human: Arne Darvin (Charlie Brill), Baris' own assistant. He had infected the grain with a <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> becomes an inert material in an organism's bloodstream which eventually prevents the organism from taking in enough nourishment to survive.|$|E

50|$|Animal <b>viruses</b> are <b>viruses</b> <b>that</b> infect animals. <b>Viruses</b> infect all {{cellular}} {{life and}} although viruses infect every animal, plant and protist species, each {{has their own}} specific range of <b>viruses</b> <b>that</b> often infect only that species.|$|R
5|$|In 1957 {{another new}} {{strain of the}} virus emerged and caused a {{pandemic}} of Asian flu; although the virus was not as virulent as the 1918 strain, over one million died worldwide. The next pandemic occurred when Hong Kong flu emerged in 1968, a new strain of the <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> replaced the 1957 strain. Affecting mainly the elderly, the 1968 pandemic was the least severe, but 33,800 {{were killed in the}} US. New strains of influenza virus often originate in East Asia; in rural China the concentration of ducks, pigs, and humans in close proximity is the highest in the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, it was {{determined}} that the rhesus monkey kidney cells used to prepare the poliovirus vaccines were infected with the SV40 virus (Simian Virus-40). SV40 was also discovered in 1960 and is a naturally occurring <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> infects monkeys. In 1961, SV40 was found to cause tumors in rodents. More recently, the virus was found in certain forms of cancer in humans, for instance brain and bone tumors, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, and some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, it has not been determined that SV40 causes these cancers.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Knut's full autopsy {{results were}} {{published}} by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the Journal of Comparative Pathology. It was the most in-depth post-mortem ever carried out on an animal. The autopsy revealed that {{the damage to the}} bear’s brain was so severe that even if he had not fallen into the water and drowned he would have died anyway. Experts hypothesized that he was suffering from a <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> caused the encephalitis.|$|E
50|$|This {{basic idea}} extends to <b>viruses</b> <b>that</b> {{do not contain}} an envelope. Well studied {{examples}} are the <b>viruses</b> <b>that</b> infect bacteria, known as bacteriophages or simply phages.

50|$|A {{number of}} {{satellite}} <b>viruses</b> - <b>viruses</b> <b>that</b> require {{the assistance of}} another virus to complete their life cycle - are also known. Thei taxonomy {{has yet to be}} settled. The following four genera have been proposed for positive sense single stranded RNA satellite <b>viruses</b> <b>that</b> infect plants - Albetovirus, Aumaivirus, Papanivirus and Virtovirus. A family - Sarthroviridae which includes the genus Macronovirus - has been proposed for the positive sense single stranded RNA satellite <b>viruses</b> <b>that</b> infect arthropods.|$|R

5|$|In general, avian {{influenza}} {{is a disease}} of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> is not normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern {{in areas such as}} Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected. The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{the cause of the}} disease until 1903 when Adelchi Negri (1876–1912) first saw {{microscopic}} lesions– now called Negri bodies– in the brains of rabid animals. He wrongly thought they were protozoan parasites. Paul Remlinger (1871–1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa, and even smaller than bacteria. Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150nanometres long, now known to be the size of rhabdovirus particles– the <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> causes rabies.|$|E

Now working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation with agent Emma Hollis (Klea Scott), Black seeks to discredit and expose the Group for their sinister motives.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} HIV have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> was {{initially}} discovered and termed both LAV and HTLV-III. It is more virulent, more infective, {{and is the}} cause of the majority of HIV infections globally. The lower infectivity of HIV-2 compared to HIV-1 implies that fewer of those exposed to HIV-2 will be infected per exposure. Because of its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to West Africa.|$|E
5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and the <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> causes foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E

5|$|In 2259, Enterprise {{receives}} a distress {{call from a}} space station harvesting {{the power of a}} binary star. There is too much interference to beam the crew aboard, so Kirk and Spock (voiced by Zachary Quinto) take a shuttle to rescue the crew. They encounter T'Mar, a childhood friend of Spock, who explains they were gathering energy to power the Helios device, which would speed up the terraforming of New Vulcan; the team inadvertently opened a rip in the fabric of space. Beaming to New Vulcan, Kirk and Spock meet with T'Mar's father Surok, who explains the station's power from the base was lost after they were attacked by creatures—who call themselves the Gorn— from the rip. The Gorn infect some of the crew with a <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> makes them aggressive. Kirk and Spock enter the locked down sections of the base to recover the infected survivors, but are unable to stop the Gorn from stealing the Helios device and kidnapping Surok.|$|E
5|$|Later, a huge onboard {{television}} screen displays an emergency message {{from a military}} officer, warning the crew and passengers about a deadly <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> has started to spread on the mainland. He says that all ships must remain at sea to ensure that humanity survives. The message is actually taken from a movie in the Simpson cabin's DVD library, set up by Bart to broadcast all over the ship. He also disables communications with the mainland by pouring hot fudge on a control panel. As the ship stays at sea, conditions deteriorate and the food supply starts to run out. Eventually, the cruise turns into a post-apocalyptic civilization, with gladiator arenas, marauders, capital punishment, and Priddis claiming kingship over the passengers.|$|E
50|$|One of the best-studied <b>viruses</b> <b>that</b> {{does this}} is HIV. HIV uses reverse {{transcriptase}} {{to create a}} DNA copy of its RNA genome. HIV latency allows the virus to largely avoid the immune system. Like other <b>viruses</b> <b>that</b> go latent, it does not typically cause symptoms while latent. Unfortunately, HIV in proviral latency {{is nearly impossible to}} target with antiretroviral drugs.|$|R
40|$|Satellite viruses encode {{structural}} proteins {{required for}} the formation of infectious particles but depend on helper viruses for completing their replication cycles. Because of this unique property, satellite <b>viruses</b> <b>that</b> infect plants, arthropods, or mammals, as well as the more recently discovered satellite-like <b>viruses</b> <b>that</b> infect protists (virophages), have been grouped with other, so-called "sub-viral agents. " For the most part, satellite viruses are therefore not classified. We argue that possession of a coat-protein-encoding gene and the ability to form virions are the defining features of a bona fide virus. Accordingly, all satellite viruses and virophages should be consistently classified within appropriate taxa. We propose to create four new genera - Albetovirus, Aumaivirus, Papanivirus, and Virtovirus - for positive-sense single-stranded (+) RNA satellite <b>viruses</b> <b>that</b> infect plants and the family Sarthroviridae, including the genus Macronovirus, for (+) RNA satellite <b>viruses</b> <b>that</b> infect arthopods. For double-stranded DNA virophages, we propose to establish the family Lavidaviridae, including two genera, Sputnikvirus and Mavirus...|$|R
