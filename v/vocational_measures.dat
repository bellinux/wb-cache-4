40|$|Donald Super {{conceptualized}} {{a general}} theory of developmental vocational and career choice based on four models: 1) the traditional, 2) the developmental, 3) the economic, social and environmental, and 4) the phenomenological. Considering that vocational maturity can be revealed by the constant process of interaction between individuals and their environment, this present work aims to explore the concept of vocational maturity within the transcultural field (the third model). Data were collected through several maturity inventories and results show that Super's theoretical model of vocational maturity can be generalized to several cultures, in particular to the ones that can be comparable to the American society, although some careful data examination is always needed. Finally, we suggest the need of new studies aiming to improve {{the psychometric properties of}} <b>vocational</b> <b>measures</b> in some countries, trying to pinpoint cultural and social differences when they appear...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlexithymia {{refers to}} an individual's deficit in {{identifying}} and processing feelings, in distinguishing feelings from bodily sensations, and an externally oriented way of thinking. Alexithymia {{has been linked to}} lower scores on verbal, non-verbal and general intelligence tests (Lilly & Valdez, 2001). Other studies have shown that higher scores in alexithymia measures corresponded to lower scores in creativity (Zenasni & Lubart, 2009) and emotional intelligence (Coffey & Kerns, 2003). Little research has been found exploring alexithymia with <b>vocational</b> <b>measures,</b> such as vocational maturity. The latter has been defined as how well individuals are capable to manage the cognitive and affective tasks that are proper to his or her stage of career development (Super & Thompson, 1979). This research aims to verify the impact of alexithymia (measured by the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, TAS- 20) on vocational maturity (measured by the Career Educational Questionnaire, CEQ). The sample consisted of 592 Brazilian university students, ages between 16 and 51 years old, of both sexes (M = 224; F = 368). Multiple regression analysis was conducted to evaluate how well the three dimensions of alexithymia measured by the TAS- 20 (difficulty in describing feelings, difficulty in identifying feelings and external-oriented thinking) predicted the four dimensions of the vocational maturity measured by the CEQ (self-knowledge, information sources, career planning, decision factors and occupational knowledge). Results: using Bonferroni method the type I error was controlled. The determination coefficient (R 2 =. 127) indicates that 13 % of the variance of the decision factors (CEQ) is explained by the linear association with the difficulty in identifying feelings (TAS- 20). Low scores on the decision factors (capacity to identify qualities and flaws of one's personality in order to choose a career) can be explained by a higher difficulty in identifying one's feelings...|$|E
40|$|It {{might seem}} incongruous {{to bring forward}} {{the issue of the}} {{vocational}} reintegration of the homeless in a time deeply marked by fragmented career histories and beset by looming widespread unemployment. But this issue will loose none of its urgent topicality as long as work continues to be a key factors in shaping life, conferring social participation and social prestige, recognition and self-respect - or for as long as employment, career and the family retain their power as vital constituents of identity whose loss can precipitate or exacerbate a descent into homelessness. Against this backdrop, one of the central concerns of the present study is to investigate and evaluate the framework conditions for reintegration projects whose holistic approach has been extended to take in the area of "work" alongside other key life-areas such as "housing", "health" and "leisure". This also involves elucidating those conditions which inhibit institutions caring for the homeless from offering vocational opportunities, and thus from acting as socialisation instances along the path of long-term destitution. A multiple-perspective approach has been adopted based on: 1) an historical-theoretical analysis of institutions caring for the homeless; 2) a quantitative survey of 760 homeless persons and persons facing homelessness, assessing their aptitude for vocational (re-) integration in terms of motivation, professional qualification, health, and psycho-social outlook; 3) a qualitative expert survey for the reconstruction of action-weighted orientation in key actors in the provision of care for the homeless, and; 4) comparative case studies of six Berlin vocational employment projects in the homeless sector. As the results of the quantitative survey show, loss of employment remains one of the key triggers of homelessness. Furthermore, the longer the period of unemployment continues, the greater is its negative impact on the homeless person in terms of worsening motivation, health, and psycho-social outlook. Thus vocational and professional qualification projects play a preventive role in pre-empting even greater deprivation during the term of homelessness. From an historical perspective, however, it is apparent that <b>vocational</b> <b>measures</b> based on coercion and discipline have an markedly adverse effect on homeless peoples' attempts to re-enter the world of work. Constructive coping strategies that actively promote attempts to leave homelessness behind can only be put in place in projects based on such key principles as direct involvement of the homeless, voluntary, non-coercive participation, self-organisation, personal responsibility for daily organisation, integrated social and vocational qualification programmes, empowerment, and the physical separation of living quarters and work. </p...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study the life-changing {{processes}} necessary {{when a person is}} faced with the demands caused by chronic illness or disability. As subjects for the study, women with chronic pain (fibromyalgi and myofascial pain syndrome), were chosen. Eighteen women active in working life were interviewed on two occasions, with an interval of two months. The women have been living with their pain for various periods of time and had reached different points in their life adjustment process. Their life stories have shown how they reason in order to create meaning and coherence in the new life conditions imposed by the pain. The result is summed up in the Life Adjustment Model, which is described in three stages. The model reflects a biographical perspective, i. e. the changing relationship to the past, the present, and the future. Stage I is the period when the self image is seen as threatened and is defended, among other things, by denying the problems. Getting a medical explanation for the state of pain becomes very important in order to proceed with the adjustment work. In Stage II, the pain as a chronic condition has been acknowledged, and the emotional process becomes obvious. Coping strategies are activated. Later in this stage, the self- confidence is restored and strategies are developed to manage to live with the pain. In Stage III, the coping strategies which have been tried in order to handle the psychological stress caused by the pain are stabilised, and they turn into routine adaptation. A maintenance work is developed, which becomes a companion in life in order to tackle and integrate the pain. By thus regarding life adjustment as a long-term process, the meaning of living with one's illness or disability is made clear. It should not be regarded as a finished event. Instead it will become a potential stress factor {{for the rest of the}} life. Since these women are active workers, the importance of the rehabilitation situation for the life adjustment process is given special attention in the study. One conclusion is that a holistic rehabilitation (the personal working through process, medical and <b>vocational</b> <b>measures)</b> must be taken into account and co- ordinated in order to make it possible for the life adjustment to proceed...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2002. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{major concern}} {{in the world of}} work has been the {{mismatch}} between a person's vocational interests and job pursuits. The understanding has been that jobs make differing demands on people and that the abilities of the individual and demands of the job have a bearing on productivity hence the need for matching people to jobs. The most notable attempts to identify and organize vocational interests have been Holland's theory of vocational interests and personality types. Holland asserts that people can be categorized predominantly as one of six personality types, namely, realistic (R), investigative (I), artistic (A), social (S), enterprising (E), and conventional (C). The review of literature has shown that person-environment fit explains the degree of match between occupational pursuits and one's vocational interests and that before a measure can be used across cultures, its construct validity must be established in each culture. The current study was motivated by the Zimbabwe Public Service Commission's quest, in the absence of <b>vocational</b> interest <b>measures</b> tailored for Zimbabwe, for assessment tools that can assist in predicting suitability for recruitment or promotion. The study was therefore designed to (a) develop a <b>measure</b> of <b>vocational</b> interest validated on the Zimbabwe population, (b) build a model for predicting and classifying people into job sectors and (c) assess the adequacy of Holland's RIASEC structure for assessing person-job fit in the Zimbabwe Public Service. To achieve this, a correlational research design was used. The <b>vocational</b> interest <b>measure</b> and the MB- 10 were the two instruments used for data collection. A sample of 500 public servants representing six occupational sectors in the Zimbabwe Public Service participated in the study. Statistical approaches to data analysis included reliability and validity analysis, factor analysis and multiple discriminant analysis. The results of the reliability coefficients were within acceptable levels. The subscale reliabilities of the <b>vocational</b> interest <b>measure</b> ranged from ra = 0. 85 to ra = 0. 89. Overall, the concurrent validity of the <b>vocational</b> interest <b>measure</b> was established. Factor analysis and correlation coefficients statistic assessed the adequacy of the hexagonal ordering of the RIASEC types. Factor analysis was computed resulting in 8 factors being extracted instead of the theoretically conceptualized 6 factors. The 8 extracted factors accounted for 65. 88 % of the total variance. Holland's theory affirms that occupational types that are more proximate on the hexagon are more similar than types that are more distant. Results of the RIASEC intercorrelations showed strong correlations between Realistic and Investigative (r = 0. 69) and moderate correlations with four of the adjacent types. However, low and negative correlations were obtained between Conventional and Realistic (adjacent types) (r = - 0. 14) and between Investigative and Conventional (alternate types) (r = - 0. 11). On the other hand, there was strong correlation between Realistic and Social (opposite types) (r = 0. 25.) The model for predicting and classifying people into appropriate job sectors was developed. The model's utility was confirmed using the scores from the sample data. The cross validation table obtained an error rate of 0. 29, an indication of a relatively good model. Given {{the results of the present}} study, it appears the study hypotheses were generally supported. Further work in refining the model is recommended...|$|R

40|$|Women {{workers in}} the United States do not share equally in earned income with men, and the {{majority}} of female workers are employed in traditionally female occupations where the pay is also traditionally low. A socialization pattern seems to assign women certain career roles which have been traditionally female and to influence women in their professional ambitions and in making satisfying career choices. This study represents an attempt to investigate possible variables which influence women in making satisfying congruent career choices. The relationship of sex-role classification, as measured by the Bem Sex-role Inventory (BSRI), <b>vocational</b> interests, as <b>measured</b> by the <b>Vocational</b> Preference Inventory (VPI), and expressed vocational interests, as indicated by declared college major, of selected college women was examined by this study. Sex-role type was studied as a variable which could possible cause women to ignore the socialization process and is attending attitudes to select preferred atypical careers. The purposes {{of the study was to}} discover possible differences in sex-role identity between women who make congruent career choices and women who make incongruent career choices and to add an understanding of the process of career choice for women. The BSRI and VPI were administered to a group of undergraduate women in lower division psychology and English classes at a regional Southeastern state university. The score for each student’s Vocational interest type from the VPI was compared with that student’s declared college major, using a table of college majors arranged by Holland’s Typology of Occupational Environments which corresponds to the six scales of vocational interest types of the VPI. A congruent choice was indicated if a subject’s declared college major was listed in the occupational environment of her <b>measured</b> <b>vocational</b> interest type scale. Tables presented the proportion of sex-role classification (masculine, feminine, androgynous, and undifferentiated) in the congruent and incongruent vocational preference groupings as well as the proportion of sex-role classification in each preference group reported according to <b>measured</b> <b>vocational</b> interest. The findings of this study tentatively suggest that the variable of sex-role type does influence career choice, as problems were encountered by women whose sex-role classification was masculine or undifferentiated. The study did not indicate that the sex-role classification of androgyny was a sufficient condition to greatly influence the congruent outcome of career choice of the college women in this sample. In the population of this research, highly sex-typed feminine women—as well as androgynous women-chose college majors congruent to their <b>measured</b> <b>vocational</b> interest, indicating a satisfying career choice.

40|$|Continuing {{vocational}} training {{is considered to}} play an important role in both social and occupational inclusion. The present paper will analyse the influence this exerts on participation in continuing {{vocational training}} and on private expenditure, the latter being measured in terms of the costs borne by the trainees themselves and the amount of free time invested. Consideration needs to be accorded to the fact that individual social groups enjoy different levels of access to continuing training and to the circumstance that their commitment to continuing training is influenced by varying prevailing general conditions. For this reason, the principle focus of the paper will be on the question of how these general conditions or work-life situations can be described and on whether it is possible to identify various groups. The main features of <b>vocational</b> orientation <b>measures</b> will also be included in the analysis. The basis for the study is the data collected by an expert commission set up to look into the financing of lifelong learning and the participation or non-participation in continuing training and the results of an investigation conducted by the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training into the costs and benefits of continuing vocational training for individuals. These two studies are based on the same statistical population and render it possible to observe aspects of both continuing training participation and private expenditure in terms of how these relate to continuing training. It becomes readily apparent that persons may be allocated to groups in accordance with the work-life situation characteristics they display, these groups exhibiting differences in terms of inclusion and investment in continuing vocational training. Although gender is revealed to exert no significant individual influence on commitment to continuing training, women in particular form a group which has its basis in their work-life situation, the fact that the latter tends to present some difficulties meaning that a lower level of commitment to continuing training may be exhibited. In addition to the above, <b>vocational</b> orientation <b>measures</b> exert a clear influence on commitment to continuing training.

The control group consisted of 37 employees selected through a computer generated random list. The two groups were combined to form a third or total group. The instruments administered were: the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionaire, the Strong-Campbell Interest Inventory, the Job Descriptive Index, and the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionaire. Statistical treatment of the data consisted of: one-way analysis of variance, chi-square, stepwise discriminant analysis, and Pearson-product moment correlation. Analysis of the data yielded significant results in several areas. The experimental (voluntary) group was found to be more expedient, tough-minded, self-reliant and independent than the control group. The job satisfied employees were found to be more emotionally stable, calm, adventurous, active, outgoing, experimenting, liberal and free-thinking than the job dissatisfied employees. The job satisfied group had also been in their present occupation for a significantly shorter period of time. The organizational variables along with years in present occupation and two of the personality factors were the combination of discriminators which best distinguished job satisfied from job dissatisfied employees. The JDI and MSQ were significantly correlated. All other analyses, including those dealing with vocational interest, were not significant.

The aim of the Plan was to encourage nearly five million farmers to give up farming. That would make it possible to redistribute their land and increase the size of the remaining family farms.

40|$|Tested {{hypothesis}} {{derived from}} J. L. Holland’s (1997) theory of vocational choice: relations between combination of levels personality dimensions (Consistency, and Differentiation) and three work related personal variables (Self-Control, Acquiescence and Pragmatism). Holland’s Vocational Preference Inventory – VPI (Polish version 1998 by Nosal, Piskorz i Świąt-nicki) {{was used to}} identify consistent-inconsistent and differentiated-undifferentiated <b>vocational</b> patterns. <b>Measures</b> of Self-Control and Acquiescence were also computed using the VPI. Wojciszke’s The Pragmatism Scale (derived {{in part from the}} Self-Monitoring Scale and based on M. Snyder’s – 1974, 1979 – theory of the pragmatic and principled selves) was used to identify level of Pragmatism. Ss were 100 person, 66 women and 34 men, ages 23 to 61 years (M = 34, 86,SD = 10, 88) with higher level of education. They represented conventional and social types of vocation. Ss’ scores on VPI inventory using cluster analysis were grouped into three combinations of personality profiles – Consistent/Differentiated, Inconsistent/Differentiated, and Inconsistent/Undifferentiated. By using clusters as independent variables was found that Inconsistent/Undifferentiated profiles had the lowest Acquiescence scores and Consistent/Differentiated had the lowest Self-Control scores. Inconsistent/Differentiated profiles were associated with the highest Pragmatism...|$|R
