40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern on {{lightweight}} aggregates (LWA) for recycling of waste materials: this manufacturing technology is considered a flexible tool to make it possible the conversion of large amounts of residues into building products. The main challenge for this purpose is the control on the technological behavior during firing of waste-bearing batches. The target is engineering the sintering and expansion of LWA in order to tailor bulk density, mechanical strength and water absorption on various possible applications (e. g., structural and non-structural lightweight concretes, lightweight mortars, filtration substrates, floriculture). The prediction of the aggregate expansion – and hence the batch design – is usually carried out utilizing the Riley’s and/or Cougny’s schemes, which are based on the bulk chemical composition of clay bodies. However, collecting the literature data on waste-based LWA and plotting them in the Riley’s and Cougny’s diagrams, no reliable discrimination turns out between expanding and non-expanding batches. In the same way, the attempt to modify the Riley’s and Cougny’s parameters, including elements present in wastes but not in natural raw materials, was unsuccessful. From this standpoint, a new approach to assess the batch expandability was developed through a deeper comprehension of mechanisms acting on sintering and expansion of LWA. A specific characterization protocol was set up, entailing hot-stage microscopy and determination of phase composition and microstructure.

This destruction resulted in locally severe top-soil contamination by arsenic, heavy metals and dioxins and furans. The main type of shell, called “blue cross shell” were loaded high explosives coating a glass bottle containing solid diphenylchloroarsine (CLARK 1) and diphenylcyanoarsine (CLARK 2) which have released considerable amounts of arsenic oxides during their combustion. The biogeochemical behavior of arsenic is poorly documented {{in this type of}} environment. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the arsenic speciation in relation to mineral and microbial compartments in this particular context [...] Four soils were sampled presenting different levels of contamination. The concentrations of major and trace elements were analyzed by ICP-MS. In the samples, the concentration range of arsenic was 1937 - 72, 820 mg/kg. Zinc, copper and lead reached concentrations up to 90, 190 mg/kg, 9113 mg/kg and 5777 mg/kg, respectively. SEM observations and EDS analyses were performed on different grains. Results showed that the polluted material was composed of inherited minerals (silicates), charcoal and secondary phases, carrier of metals. In metal rich grains, two phases were identified : a crystalline phase, where arsenic was associated with copper and zinc, and an amorphous phase rich in iron, zinc, copper, and arsenic. Four secondary arsenate minerals were identified by X-ray diffraction: adamite and olivenite (zinc and copper arsenates, respectively) and two pharmacosiderites. Arsenic speciation displayed by SEM-EDS and XRD was proven to be directly linked to the thermal treatments of shells. Indeed, the two main As-carriers were identified as <b>vitreous</b> <b>phases,</b> composed of a blend of metals, and secondary arsenates minerals, which were formed in the material’s porosity during its cooling.

40|$|International audienceDielectric {{breakdown}} {{constitutes an}} important limitation {{in the use}} of insulating materials under high-voltage since it can lead to the local fusion and sublimation of the insulator. The role of electrical charge transport and trapping in alumina ceramics on their resistance to this catastrophic phenomenon is studied in this work. In polycrystalline materials, the interfaces between the various phases play a main role because they constitute potential sites for the trapping of electrical charges. The density and the nature of these interfaces can be controlled by the way of the microstructure parameters. So, the aim of the present paper is to highlight the influence of average grain size and intergranular phase crystallization rate on the ability of polycrystalline alumina materials to resist to dielectric breakdown. Thus, it is shown that the control of the process conditions (sintering aids content, powder grain size and thermal cycle) makes it possible to change not only the density (by the average grain size) but also the nature (by the crystallization or not of anorthite) of the grain boundaries. On one hand, at room temperature a high density of interfaces, due to low grain size and highly crystallized intergranular phase, leads to a high dielectric strength. On the other hand, at higher temperature (250 degrees C), the presence of <b>vitreous</b> intergranular <b>phase</b> makes it possible to delay breakdown. That behaviour is explained thanks to charge transport and trapping characterizations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All fights reserved...|$|R

In {{the whole range of}} magnetic fields up to 9 T, vortex pinning precludes the formation of an ordered Abrikosov lattice. Instead, a <b>vitreous</b> vortex <b>phase</b> (vortex glass) with a short-range hexagonal order is observed. Statistical processing of MFM datasets lets us directly measure its radial and angular distribution functions and extract the radial correlation length ζ. In contrast to predictions of the collective pinning model, no increase in the correlated volume with the applied field is observed. Instead, we find that ζ decreases as 1. 3 *R 1 H^(- 1 / 2) over four decades of the applied magnetic field, where R 1 is the radius of the first coordination shell of the vortex lattice. Such universal scaling of ζ implies that the vortex pinning in iron arsenides remains strong {{even in the absence of}} static magnetism. This result is consistent with all the real- and reciprocal-space vortex-lattice measurements in overdoped as-grown aFe_ 2 -xCo_xAs_ 2 published to date and is thus sample-independent.

40|$|A {{relation}} of fluorescence spectra of Chlorella (in the 295 - 77 °K range) {{to the changes}} in the phas e of the ice is suggested in this paper. When ChloreUa cells are first cooled to 77 °K and then warmed slowly, the Change of the fluorescence intensity as a function of temperature is different for different bands as earlier reported in spinach chloroplasts. In the 8 o-i 5 o°K range, the F 698 decreases rapidly, F 687 remains almost unchanged, and f 68 o increases; above I 5 o°K (the temperature at which ice changes from <b>vitreous</b> to cubic <b>phase),</b> F 687 decreases more rapidly than any other band. The F 725, that decreases smoothly in the 77 - 295 °K range, is composed of several bands (F 7 I 7 and F 725). If Chlorella cells are first cooled to 77 °K, and then warmed to 26 o°K, and recooled to 77 °K before melting, f 685, f 698 and f 73 o-but not f 7 IT-are lowered; this fluorescence decrease is not due to changes in the reabsorption of fluorescence or to major changes in the cellular structure due to freezing. The F 698 band is greatly influenced by the aqueous environment; the phase of the ice and the addition of polar solvents (IO % dimethylsulfoxide) greatly influence it. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that 17698 is from an energy trap (at low temperatures) of System II...|$|R

Introduction From the Middle Ages until {{the beginning of}} the 20 th century, extensive Zn-Pb mining and smelting was carried out in East-Belgium. By lack of waste treatment techniques and of sustainable management practices, metal-bearing slags and unprocessed waste were dumped. Besides the important amount of waste that is stored in huge mine tailings, the surroundings of the tailings are often contaminated {{as a consequence of the}} dispersal of contaminants by wind erosion, runoff or fluvial transport. In the present study, the distribution pattern, the actual and potential mobilisation and (natural) attenuation of Pb, Zn and Cd in the mine tailings of La Calamine and Angleur (East-Belgium) was investigated. 2. Methodology In La Calamine and Angleur (East-Belgium), vertical profiles were sampled in detail within tailings consisting of respectively dredged mine tailing pond sediments and waste from the metallurgical process of Zn-production. Samples were also taken from overbank sediments along the Geul 7, 9 and 12 km downstream from the mine tailing pond of La Calamine and in the neighbourhood (300 m) of the dump site of Angleur. Total metal concentrations, pH and grainsize were determined for all the samples and a mineralogical (petrography, XRD, SEM-EDX) investigation of tailing material from La Calamine and Angleur was carried out. Porewater extractions and the DIN 38414 -S 4 leaching test (extraction with water at a liquid/solid ratio of 10 / 1) were used to evaluate heavy metal leaching from the tailing material. pHstat leaching tests and geochemical modelling of the pH-dependent leaching behaviour were performed on a selection of samples from both mine tailings. The feasibility of the addition of phosphates as a measure to reduce the release of Pb, Zn and Cd into the environment was also investigated. 3. Results and discussion 3. 1. Mineralogical and physico-chemical characterisation At both locations, mine tailings and soils in the surrounding of the tailings were contaminated with Zn, Pb, Cd and As (Table 1). The mine tailing in La Calamine is located in a rural area with a low population density. The nearby Geul river flows through the mine tailing, resulting in a severe contamination of alluvial soils downstream from the tailing. The area around the mine tailing in Angleur has been urbanised. The main minerals in the La Calamine mine tailing were sfalerite (ZnS), smithsonite (ZnCO 3), anglesite (PbSO 4), cerrusite (PbCO 3), galena (PbS), pyrite (FeS 2) and marcasite (FeS 2). Whereas more acid pH values (between 3 and 4. 9) were encountered in the deeper part of the tailing (between 2. 6 and 4 m depth), a lower mobility of Zn, Pb and Cd was found compared to the upper part of the tailing, where pH was in the range 5 - 7. The oxidation of sulphide minerals within the mine tailing releases H+, SO 42 -, Fe 2 +, and trace metals into the porewater. Subsequent pH-buffering in carbonate-rich layers results in the precipitation of secondary minerals such as ZnCO 3, FeCO 3 and CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O. These precipitation processes result in the formation of cemented layers, which show an enrichment in Cd and Zn. Whereas the carbonate-rich layers provide some natural attenuation of contaminants, elevated Zn-, Pb- and Cd concentrations are found in the porewater in the surface layers of the tailing (0 - 2. 6 m depth). In the mine tailing of Angleur, XRD analysis revealed the presence of several oxides and silicates such as franklinite (ZnFe 2 O 4), willemite (Zn 2 SiO 4), wollastonite (CaSiO 3), and traces of sulphates, sulphides and carbonates. pH was neutral to slightly alkaline for al the samples investigated. The upper part of the tailing (0 - 0. 7 m depth) was less contaminated than the lower part (0. 7 - 4 m depth). Contrary to the tailing material in La Calamine and despite the elevated total heavy metal and arsenic concentrations on the site, the DIN 38414 -S 4 leaching test indicates that heavy metal release is very limited and far below European limit values for slag material on dumps (category 1).

In Angleur, <b>vitreous</b> <b>phases</b> seem very important in controlling heavy metal mobility since metals that are locked up in a silicate matrix are protected against leaching. Liming will not be an effective remediation option for the tailing in Angleur, since As and Pb will be mobilised when pH increases (Fig. 1). However, for the La Calamine dredged mine tailing pond sediments, a pH-increase significantly decreases the leachability of Zn, Cd and Pb, whereas the solubility of As is not affected and remains very low. The addition of phosphates in combination with liming results in an additional decrease of heavy metal solubility and contributes to a reduction of the release of Pb, Zn and Cd into the environment. Fig. 1 : pH-dependent leaching behaviuor of Pb, Cd and As in a sample from the tailing of La Calamine (a) and Angleur (b). Total Pb-, Cd- and As-concentrations and pH of the samples are also indicated. 4. Conclusion In La Calamine, liming and the addition of phosphates can effectively reduce heavy metal leaching from the tailing. However, at both locations, wind erosion and runoff can cause the spreading of fine-grained dust, especially since the waste material is not covered. For a sustainable development of the mining areas of La Calamine and Angleur surface stabilisation is also necessary. status: publishe...|$|R
