40|$|We {{report on}} a hybrid {{integrated}} tunneling diode, with a simple structure, and a quantum well laser diode, lasing at ~ 1060 nm, on GaAs substrate. The low-frequency operation of the integrated circuit was measured and obvious negative differential resistance regions were shown in the electrical and optical output. The electrical and optical bistability were measured, and the peak and <b>valley</b> <b>voltage</b> were 2. 03 and 2. 17 V, respectively. A 140 -mV-wide hysteresis loop and an optical on/off ratio of 21 dB were obtained. The device has potential applications in biomedicine and optical interconnects...|$|E
40|$|A barrier width {{modulated}} GaN based resonant {{tunnel diode}} is theoretically proposed which exhibits a giant {{peak to valley}} current ratio as high as 60 and a high negative differential conductance (NDC) of 1. 77 x 10 (6) S/cm(2) with very low valley current density of 3 mA/cm(2). This is achieved by the unique characteristic of the device current which monotonically decreases for applied voltages greater than the <b>valley</b> <b>voltage</b> in our simulation window. This {{is in contrast to}} all the other negative differential conductance based devices which experience an immediate exponential increase in current after the NDC region. The proposed device is also the first bidirectional tunneling diode which shows negative differential conductance for both polarity of the applied bias which is normally not observed with the conventional GaN/AIGaN double barrier structures due to the strong asymmetry arising from the internal electric fields due to polarization. The unique characteristics of the device {{can be attributed to the}} use of a modulated barrier width which is made possible by a polarization modulating InGaN layer and efficient utilization of internal electric fields in III-nitrides.

40|$|Well-defined {{experimental}} and simulating single {{peak to valley}} current density ratio (PVCDR) resonant tunneling electronic circuit (RTEC) element is proposed in this research. The variation of passive element value in RTEC structure is explored using simulation method, which obtains the optimum PVCDR values about 66. The simulating peak current density (PCD) value is such high as 38 mA. Even though the experimental PCD value is less, but the PVCDR value {{is as high as}} 22. 5, which value is favorably compared with semiconductor resonant tunneling devices (RTDs) in single PVCDR RTEC element. The obvious triple negative differential resistance (NDR) is also completed using composition of three suitable single RTEC elements. Also, experimental triple PVCDR RTEC element significantly exhibits three NDR curves with obvious three PVCDR values about 3. 4, 3. 8, and 6. 0, respectively. Both peak voltage (PV) value and <b>valley</b> <b>voltage</b> (VV) values of experimental triple PVCDR RTEC element is less than 2. 8 V, which value is profitable in development of commercial product. Power consumption of triple PVCDR RTEC element is as low as 75. 5 ÂµW, which low power consumption will shrink the difficulty of element packaging in heat dissipation...|$|E
40|$|Based on DFT+U and Berry {{curvature}} calculations, {{we study}} the electronic structures and topological properties of 3 d transition metal (TM) atom (from Ti to Co) adsorbed germanene (TM-germanene). We find that valley-polarized anomalous hall effect (VAHE) {{can be realized}} in germanene by adsorbing Cr, Mn, or Co atom on its surface. A finite <b>valley</b> hall <b>voltage</b> can be easily detected in its nanoribbon, which is important for valleytronics devices. Moreover, different valley-polarized current and even reversible <b>valley</b> Hall <b>voltage</b> can be archived by shifting the Fermi energy of the systems. Such versatile features of the systems show potential in next generation electronics devices. Comment: 8 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

MeV, {{for medical}} applications and radioisotopes production (SCENT project) is being studied at Laboratori Nazionali del Sud in Catania. The RF system, {{working in the}} fourth harmonic, is based on four cavities operating at 93 MHz, which are connected in the central region. The paper describes an unusual multistem RF design, performed with 3 D electromagnetic codes.

5000|$|The {{most complex}} {{piece of the}} Final Scratch setup is the code pressed onto the vinyl. A 1200 hertz {{amplitude}} modulated sine wave is pressed into {{the left and right}} channels with a phase difference of 90 degrees. Each channel holds one of the two bit streams required for the time code. In one cycle of either wave form, two bits are stored: one on the positive voltage peak and one on the negative <b>voltage</b> <b>valley.</b> The relative amplitudes of these peaks represent either a binary one or zero. A relatively high amplitude on either peak represents a one, a relatively low amplitude represents a zero. In each channel is a separate bitstream, the left channel is not identical to the right (disregarding the phase difference).|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Energy {{function}} analysis {{offers a}} different geometric view of voltage collapse. In this approach, a power system operating stably {{is like a}} ball which lies {{at the bottom of}} a valley. The stability can be understood as the ball rolling back to the bottom of the valley when there is a disturbance. As the power system changes, the landscape of mountains and mountain passes surrounding the <b>valley</b> changes. A <b>voltage</b> collapse corresponds to a mountain pass being lowered so much that with a small perturbation the ball can roll from the bottom of the valley over the mountain pass and down the other side of the pass. The height of the lowest mountain pass can be computed and used as an index to monitor the proximity to voltage collapse. Key-words:- Voltage collapse, energy function theory, system stability.

40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulation}} of electron transport in an InAs and InP diode of n-i-n structure is compared with GaAs diode. All of these calculations are performed for the lattice temperature T= 300 K. We approximate the conduction band of GaAs by {{taking into account}} the valley {{in the center of the}} first Brillouin zone, four equivalent L valleys and three equivalent X <b>valleys.</b> The anode <b>voltage</b> ranges from 0, 75 V, 1, 5 V and 2 V. The distributions of electron energies, electron velocities, potential and the profiles of the electric field are computed. For higher anode voltages and longer active regions, inter-valley scattering as well as back scattering effects control the electron transport behaviour at the anode side of the active region. Also, the effects of the lattice temperature and doping on the length of the active layer are discussed. Our calculations show that electron reach to a higher drift velocity in the InAs than InP and GaAs. So InA...|$|R
40|$|Excessive voltage {{and power}} flow issues {{associated}} with domestic solar power are threatening UK distribution system operation {{and the use of}} energy storage is one method proposed to mitigate these issues. In this study a data orientated approach was taken in order to simulate the effect of the location of the energy storage on the low voltage network. A number of small ( 50 kWh) feeder connected battery in terms of their ability to shave load demand peaks, fill load demand <b>valleys</b> and counter <b>voltage</b> violations on a typical radial feeder system. To achieve this MatLab was used to create dispatch strategies for each battery and introduce them into an aggregated load, and OpenDSS was then used to model this scenario on a typical UK radial feeder based on the IEEE European Low Voltage Test Case. It was found that the feeder connected battery was more successful at mitigating the thermal overload effects of distributed generation at the low voltage level. Domestic batteries offer ease of installation and consumer support, likely to make their utilisation increasingly inevitable. However, their exposure to domestic energy flows and focus on minimising grid import to the home led to a reduced network level impact. This work shows that a feeder connected battery can respond to the power flows of the aggregated load and thus provides a far more capable tool for reducing network peak loads and preventing feeder system export...|$|R
