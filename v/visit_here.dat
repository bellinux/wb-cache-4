5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed here because of the beds of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance {{below the surface of}} the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here. The bogs extend the shores of the lake. Migratory shorebirds that <b>visit</b> <b>here</b> include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{businessman}} and politician William Smith was appointed Lord Warden in 1891, but died in Walmer Castle {{during his first}} <b>visit</b> <b>here</b> in October of that year. Smith had proposed that the historical artefacts in the castle should be protected from being removed by later Lord Wardens and suggested that government pass an Indenture of Heirlooms Bill. The government carried out the plan after Smith's death, protecting almost 70 pieces of furniture and 50 artworks at the castle and forbidding them being moved from the castle without the Secretary of State for War's approval. Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, the Marquess of Salisbury, became the next Lord Warden; with adequate legal protection now in place, the 3rd Duke of Wellington suggested returning his grandfather's possessions to the castle, but Lady Salisbury declined the offer.|$|E

Damlataş Beach, named for the famous [...] "dripping caves", and Kleopatra Beach are to the west. The name [...] "Cleopatra" [...] possibly derives from either the Ptolemaic princess' <b>visit</b> <b>here</b> or the area's inclusion in her dowry to Mark Antony. Atatürk Bulvarı, the main boulevard, runs parallel to the sea, and divides the southern, much more touristic side of Alanya from the northern, more indigenous side that extends north into the mountains. Çevre Yolu Caddesi, another major road, encircles the main town to the north.|$|E

2500|$|San Cristóbal de las Casas and San Juan Chamula {{maintain}} a strong indigenous identity. On market day, many indigenous people {{from rural areas}} come into San Cristóbal {{to buy and sell}} mostly items for everyday use such as fruit, vegetables, animals, cloth, consumer goods and tools. [...] San Juan Chamula {{is considered to be a}} center of indigenous culture, especially its elaborate festivals of Carnival and Day of Saint John. [...] It was common for politicians, especially during Institutional Revolutionary Party's dominance to <b>visit</b> <b>here</b> during election campaigns and dress in indigenous clothing and carry a carved walking stick, a traditional sign of power. Relations between the indigenous ethnic groups is complicated. While there have been inter ethnic political activism such as that promoted by the Diocese of Chiapas in the 1970s and the Zapatista movement in the 1990s, there has been inter-indigenous conflict as well. Much of this has been based on religion, pitting those of the traditional Catholic/indigenous beliefs who support the traditional power structure against Protestants, Evangelicals and Word of God Catholics (directly allied with the Diocese) who tend to oppose it. This is particularly significant problem among the Tzeltals and Tzotzils. Starting in the 1970s, traditional leaders in San Juan Chamula began expelling dissidents from their homes and land, amounting to about 20,000 indigenous forced to leave over a thirty-year period. It continues to be a serious social problem although authorities downplay it. Recently there has been political, social and ethnic conflict between the Tzotzil who are more urbanized and have a significant number of Protestant practitioners and the Tzeltal who are predominantly Catholic and live in smaller farming communities. Many Protestant Tzotzil have accused the Tzeltal of ethnic discrimination and intimidation due to their religious beliefs and the Tzeltal have in return accused the Tzotzil of singling them out for discrimination.|$|E
