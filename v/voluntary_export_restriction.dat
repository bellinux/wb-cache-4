40|$|In {{a recent}} issue of this journal, Bouët (2001) offers a {{contribution}} to the literature dealing with the implication of quantitative restrictions in international oligopolies. The main result of the paper is that When the R-D investment has uncertain consequences on marginal cost, a <b>voluntary</b> <b>export</b> <b>restriction</b> (VER) decreases innovation by the domestic producer as compared to the free trade level. This result holds both under Cournot and Bertrand competition (p. 323). The aim of the present note is to show that, contrary to the author's claim, the qualitative impact of the VER on R-D investment does depend on the mode of market competition in his model. In order to show this, we provide a counter-example that makes use of the linear example developed by Bouët (2001) and solve it for Bertrand competition (instead of Cournot). In this case, a VER increases R-D expenses (instead of decreasing it under Cournot), i. e. depending on the mode of competition, the implication of the VER on the R-D investment are reversed...|$|E

40|$|While {{openness}} enables {{countries to}} keep pace with the most advanced state-of-the-art knowledge, technology transfers among innovators in different countries facilitate the motivation of research and development and the spread of new knowledge and skills. Rapid technological innovations also motivate trade and international capital flows and speed up the integration process of the world economy. The thesis concentrates on two areas within these ongoing investigations; namely Trade Policy and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), within the wider discussions of the newly developed models in the theory of Economic Growth, styled "endogenous growth theory" Based on the models of new growth theory, namely Romer (1987, 1990, 1994), Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995, Chapter 4, 6, and 7), Aghion and Howitt (1992) and Grossman and Helpman (1992, Chapter 4 and 11), this thesis first focuses on the mechanism through which trade restrictions affect the welfare of a developing country. In Chapter 2, the comparison of the welfare effects of two of the most commonly used trade policies, tariff and <b>voluntary</b> <b>export</b> <b>restriction</b> (VER) is presented. It shows counter-intuitively that a VER may be superior to a tariff. Second, this thesis focuses on the mechanism illustrating the interaction of imitation, FDI, and economic growth rate of a developing country. Chapter 3 constructs a model which detects the interrelationships between FDI, innovation, imitation and the long-run growth rate. One of the major findings is that governmental policies to promote local technology activities do not necessarily improve the relative condition of labour in the policy-active country. Finally, in Chapter 4, this thesis also examines the empirical evidences of the effect of FDI upon the growth of a developing country's economy based on a recent growth model. The Taiwanese economy (1953 - 1995) is used as an empirical case study. The results show that FDI did play an important role in the manufacturing industry of Taiwan...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that trade {{restrictions}} such as tariffs, import quotas, and <b>voluntary</b> <b>export</b> <b>restrictions,</b> lead to quality upgrading of imports. In this paper, however, we reconsider this proposition by focusing on the nature of cost functions. Based on a standard vertical differentiation model, we analyze the effects of tariffs on quality and quantity of imports. We show that if a fixed cost is an increasing function of quality, tariffs lead to quality downgrading of imports. Moreover, we discuss minimum quality requirements (MQR) for such a trade policy. We show that MQR increases the amount of imports and an importing country's welfare {{in the presence of the}} fixed cost function.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} contradictions between the EU and EU {{national}} states industrial {{policies and the}} Single Market program of elimination of NTBs (non-tariff barriers). The scope of NTBs connected to European industrial policy {{is divided into two}} spheres: the first are barriers on the level of Member States and the second are barriers on the EU level. On the national level, after the 1992 programme, the EU Member States continued to adopt many technical national regulations. On the EU level measures such as new standards, environment and anti-dumping rules, as well as Community expenditures in the different funds constitute new NTBs. Moreover, external competitors have to face other NTBs, such as VERs (<b>Voluntary</b> <b>export</b> <b>restrictions),</b> biased rules on public procurement, ecolabeling, and limitations on ownership, among other barriers. In this essay I demonstrate that the EU and the European national states run an active, unofficial industrial policy that distort the internal and external competition.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effect of trade {{restrictions}} on competition in oligopolistic markets. Quantitative restrictions, such as VER's (<b>Voluntary</b> <b>Export</b> <b>Restrictions)</b> are shown to affect {{the extent to which}} foreign firms can compete in the domestic market, and hence to raise the equilibrium prices and profits of both domestic and foreign firms [...] when such restrictions are not too severe. This increase in prices and profits is shown to make it unlikely for VER's to raise National Welfare. In addition, I show that domestic output may fall due to the VER's. For these reasons, VER's {{do not seem to be}} desirable ways of restricting imports. Tariffs and Quotas are also shown to be non-equivalent in such oligopoly models. A comparison of the effects of tariffs and quotas shows that it would be in the interest of domesti cmanufacturers t lobby for VER's instead of import equivalent tariffs. In addition, it is shown that the foreign firm would prefer VER's to import equivalent tariffs, even if tariff revenues were refunded to them. Thus, the recent VER's on Japanese automobiles may well have been in the interests of both Japanese and American firms, and at the expense of the nation as a whole. ...|$|R

In this framework, the VER has an anti-competitive effect. On the basis of 1985 data we estimate the costs to the UK of the restriction to be between 95 m and 130 m pounds sterling per year. Since the welfare cost of a tariff which {{would have the same}} effect on UK production would be {{less than half of the}} cost of the <b>voluntary</b> <b>export</b> restraint, it follows that the VER is a very inefficient policy instrument. The Italian and French markets have tighter VERs than the UK, with correspondingly higher costs; but replacement of individual European VERs with Community-wide restrictions on imports from Japan would impose costs on member countries that currently do not have such restrictions.

At the same time, there has also been an increase in <b>restrictions</b> on the <b>export</b> of raw materials which has led policy makers and business people to address free trade of raw materials. This paper provides information on the present situation regarding the use of <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> and international disciplines on these measures. <b>Export</b> <b>restrictions</b> are maintained to achieve diverse policy objectives, including environmental protection or conservation of natural resources, promotion of downstream processing industries, controlling inflationary pressures, and for fiscal receipts reasons. <b>Export</b> <b>restrictions</b> take various forms such as <b>export</b> duties, quantitative <b>restrictions,</b> and licensing requirements. The number of countries applying export duties over the period 2003 - 2009 was higher than in previous years and that such duties were introduced primarily by developing and least developed countries. Under the current WTO rules, unlike quantitative <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> which are in principle prohibited, there is no substantive discipline on export duties, although there have been efforts to revise this at the multilateral and bilateral levels. The WTO accession process imposes several disciplines. <b>Export</b> <b>restrictions</b> have also been discussed during the DDA negotiations in both NAMA (Non-Agricultural Market Access) and agriculture negotiations. Several regional trade agreements (RTAs) went beyond the WTO by including prohibition of <b>export</b> duties. <b>Export</b> <b>restrictions,</b> by creating a differential between the price available to domestic processors and the price charged to foreign processors, provide domestic processing industries with an advantage. Although several governments apply <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> to achieve diverse policy objectives, not all rely on such restrictions.

This paper {{examines}} one such barrier, <b>export</b> <b>restrictions,</b> and how it impacts trade and global supply in selected strategic metals and minerals. The metals and minerals examined in the paper are of particular interest for a number of reasons: they are generally geographically concentrated in a few countries, many are used in the production of high-technology goods in strategic sectors and there are few substitutes for these raw materials given the present state of technology. For all these reasons, importing countries are dependent on a reliable supply of these raw materials. <b>Export</b> <b>restrictions</b> may be applied for a number of reasons: protection of the environment, preservation of natural resources, protection of downstream industries, or as a response to a number of different market imperfections.
