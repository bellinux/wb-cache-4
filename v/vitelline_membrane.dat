A monoisotopic molecular species at [M + H](+) of 9, 271. 56 Da was obtained, and its N- and C-terminal sequences were determined. We also examined posttranslational modifications and identified the presence of 6 internal disulfide bonds.

40|$|Most {{freshwater}} mussel (Bivalvia: Unionoida) larvae (glochidia in Margaritiferidae, Hyriidae and Unionidae) are fish parasites. Knowledge of the larval morphology and {{the mechanism of}} release in {{freshwater mussel}}s is useful in species systematics and ecology. Westralunio carteri Iredale, 1934 is the only unionoid from south-western Australia. Little information is available on its biology and its glochidia have never been described. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the glochidia of W. carteri and method of their release. Glochidia within <b>vitelline</b> <b>membranes</b> were embedded in mucus which extruded from exhalent siphons of females during spring/summer; they then hatched from <b>vitelline</b> <b>membranes</b> but remained tethered by a larval thread and began characteristically ‘winking’. Shells (n = 120) were subtriangular, 308 μm long (± 0. 83 SE), 251 μm high (± 0. 73 SE) and had a hinge length of 212 μm (± 0. 78 SE). Larval teeth were singular with interlocking cusps and convex or concave basal protuberances on opposing valves...|$|R
5000|$|Glochidia of {{most species}} of {{freshwater}} mussels are obligate parasites of fishes, but sometimes amphibians. [...] In Westralunio carteri, a mature glochidium {{is equipped with}} a pair of interlocking 'larval teeth' on opposing valves; the shell is translucent brown in colour and has a single adductor muscle and shell length, on average, is 306-309 μm. Mature glochidia are released from females during spring on strands of mucus while still encased in their <b>vitelline</b> <b>membranes</b> (a proteinaceous 'egg sac'),. [...] Shortly after release, they hatch from their <b>vitelline</b> <b>membranes</b> and begin characteristically 'winking' in preparation to attach to a passing fish,. [...] Once contact is made with a fish, the glochidia attach to the fishes' body surfaces including areas of the fins, eye, mouth, opercula, and sometimes the gills,. [...] Following attachment to their host fish, the glochidia are encased by epithelial cells, which forms a cyst,. [...] They remain in the cyst for 21-28 days as the undergo a process of metamorphosis and develop into juvenile freshwater mussels (characterised by the disappearance of the single adductor muscle and the formation of two separate adductor muscles and a ciliated foot, among other features) when they then detach from their host and begin life in the sediments, where they develop into their adult form,.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Eggs, larvae {{and adults}} {{of the four}} {{subspecies}} of Hy la regilla occurring in Oregon as given by Jameson, Mackey and Richmond (1966) were collected and subjected to salt stress {{in a series of}} graded seawaters. It was found that in all cases adults were more tolerant than larvae and larvae were more tolerant than eggs. It was also found that animals in all stages taken from the area extending westward from the crest of the Oregon Coast Range to the sea, designated as the range of Hy la regilla pacifica, were more tolerant of elevated salt levels in their ambient medium than animals from the three other subspecies areas in Oregon. Observations were made of the effect of elevated salinities on the eggs and the development of the embryos with respect to the <b>vitelline</b> <b>membranes,</b> the closure of the blastopore and neurulation.

5|$|Temnospondyls, {{like all}} amphibians, {{reproduced}} in aquatic environments. Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through external fertilization. Like most living frogs, female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them. Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 {{that may be}} egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls. They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs. The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably <b>vitelline</b> <b>membranes</b> and halo-like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings. They are attached to plant fossils, suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs. The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians, not fish (their eggs lack mucous), but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs. The eggs {{are thought to be}} from dissorophoids because {{they are likely to be}} close relatives of modern amphibians, and probably had similar reproductive strategies. They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found.|$|R

50|$|Polyspermy is the {{condition}} when multiple sperm fuse {{with a single}} egg. This results in duplications of genetic material. In sea urchins, the block to polyspermy comes from two mechanisms: the fast block and the slow block. The fast block is an electrical block to polyspermy. The resting potential of an egg is -70mV. After contact with sperm, an influx of sodium ions increases the potential up to +20mV. The slow block is through a biochemical mechanism triggered by a wave of calcium increase. The rise of calcium is both necessary and sufficient to trigger the slow block. In the cortical reaction, cortical granules directly beneath the plasma membrane are released into {{the space between the}} plasma membrane and the <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane</b> (the perivitelline space). An increase in calcium triggers this release. The contents of the granules contain proteases, mucopolysaccharides, hyalin, and peroxidases. The proteases cleave the bridges connecting the plasma membrane and the <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane</b> and cleave the bindin to release the sperm. The mucopolysaccharides attract water to raise the <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane.</b> The hyalin forms a layer adjacent to the plasma membrane and the peroxidases cross-link the protein in the <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane</b> to harden it and make it impenetrable to sperm. Through these molecules the <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane</b> is transformed into the fertilization membrane or fertilization envelope. In mice, the zona reaction is the equivalent to the cortical reaction in sea urchins. The terminal sugars from ZP3 are cleaved to release the sperm and prevent new binding.|$|E

Malignant fibroblasts (transformed by viruses) do not express SF antigen on the cell surface. In this study the in vivo differentiation and distribution of SF antigen has been investigated in the developing chick embryo using cryostat sections and immunofluorescence. The major findings were: (a) SF antigen was detectable in the loose connective tissue of very early (2 -to 3 -day old) embryos. (b) Condensation of SF antigen was seen in various boundary membranes such as the glomerular and tubular basement membranes of the kidney, the boundary membranes of the notochord, yolk sac, and <b>vitelline</b> <b>membranes</b> and liver sinusoids. (c) SF antigen was found to be cell-type specific. It was seen as a fibrillar network in the loose connective tissue of different organs but not in the parenchymal cells. It was not found in muscle cells at any stage of development. (d) The antigen was present in the undifferentiated mesenchymal cells of the kidney; but not found after their development into epithelial cells of the secretory tubules. (e) Both in vivo and in fibroblast cultures SF antigen was distributed as a fibrillar network. These data indicate that SF antigen is a "differentiation antigen" restricted to certain cells of mesenchymal origin and character, and that is accumulates in the connective tissue during embryogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{histological}} {{structures of}} the <b>vitelline</b> <b>membranes</b> (VM) of hen and duck eggs were observed by cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM), and the chemical characteristics were also compared. The outer layer surface (OLS) of duck egg VM showed networks constructed by fibrils and sheets (0. 1 - 5. 2 mu m in width), and that of hen egg presented networks formed only by sheets (2 - 6 mu m in width). Thicker fibrils (0. 5 - 1. 5 mu m in width) with different arrangement were observed on the inner layer surface (ILS) of duck egg VM as compared to those (0. 3 - 0. 7 mu m in width) of hen egg VM. Upon separation, the outer surface of the outer layer (OSOL) and the inner surface of the inner layer (ISIL) of hen and duck egg VMs were quite similar to fresh VM except that the OSOL of duck egg VM showed networks constructed only by sheets. Thin fibrils interlaced above a bumpy or flat structure were observed at the exposed surface of the outer layer (ESOL) of hen and duck egg VMs. The exposed surfaces of inner layers (ESIL) of hen and duck egg VMs showed similar structures of fibrils, which joined, branched, and ran in straight lines for long distances up to 30 mu m; however, the widths of the fibrils shown in ESOL and ESIL of duck egg VM were 0. 1 and 0. 7 - 1. 4 mu m, respectively, and were greater than those (< 0. 1 and 0. 5 - 0. 8 mu m) of hen egg VM. The continuous membranes of both hen and duck egg VMs were still attached to the outer layers when separated. The content of protein, the major component of VM, was higher in duck egg VM (88. 6 %) than in hen egg VM (81. 6 %). Four and six major SDS-soluble protein patterns with distinct localization were observed in hen and duck egg VMs, respectively. Overall, the different histological structures of hen and duck egg VMs were suggested to be majorly attributable to the diverse protein components...|$|R
40|$|Frequency {{response}} functions {{were measured}} between {{the cells of}} Xenopus laevis embryos {{during the first two}} cleavage stages. Linear systems theory was then used to produce electronic models which account for the electrical behavior of the systems.

40|$|An {{isolated}} surface complex {{consisting of}} the <b>vitelline</b> layer, plasma <b>membrane,</b> and attached secretory vesicles has been examined {{for its ability to}} bind sperm and to form the fertilization envelope. Isolated surface complexes (or intact eggs) fixed in glutaraldehyde and then washed in artificial sea water are capable of binding sperm in a species-specific manner. Sperm which bind to the isolated surface complex exhibit the acrosomal process only when they are associated with the exterior surface (vitelline layer) of the complex. Upon resuspension of the unfixed surface complex in artificial sea water, a limiting envelope is formed which, based on examination of thin sections and negatively stained surface preparations, is structurally similar to the fertilization envelope formed by the fertilized egg. These results suggest that the isolated egg surface complex retains the sperm receptor, as well as integrated functions for the secretion of components involved in assembly of the fertilization envelope...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{incorporation}} of [14 C]leucine into albumin and transferrin in early rat foetuses, <b>vitelline</b> plus amniotic <b>membranes,</b> chorioallantoic placenta and perinatal rat liver slices was measured and used to detect and compare the rates of synthesis of the two proteins. Albumin synthesis was detected {{in the body of}} foetuses from 13 days gestation onwards. Transferrin synthesis was detected only after day 15. Transferrin synthesis was demonstrable in the membranes but not in the chorioallantoic placenta of all the animals investigated, i. e. from 13 to 19 days gestation. Synthesis of albumin and transferrin by the liver of near-term and postnatal animals was shown to correlate with published data on the parenchymal cell number/unit wet wt. of liver. Near-term foetuses synthesized relatively more transferrin than albumin when compared with 10 -day postnatal animals. The serum concentrations of the two plasma proteins were also determined. These increased before term whereas the rate of synthesis of albumin and transferrin declined. Postnatally, plasma albumin concentration increased but transferrin concentration decreased, yet the rates of synthesis of both proteins by the liver increased with age. This lack of correlation between the rates of synthesis of the two proteins and their respective plasma concentrations could be explained in part by their increased stability after birth. There was also evidence that the liver haemopoietic cells took up transferrin although they do not synthesize the protein. Thus the decrease in this population of cells during development could also contribute to the discrepancy between liver synthesis and serum concentrations of transferrin...|$|R
50|$|The yolk {{in a newly}} laid egg {{is round}} and firm.

50|$|Ovomucin is a {{glycoprotein}} found {{mainly in}} egg whites, {{as well as}} in the chalaza and <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane.</b> The protein makes up around 2-4% of the protein content of egg whites; like other members of the mucin protein family, ovomucin confers gel-like properties.

50|$|As {{soon as the}} {{spermatozoon}} fuses {{with the}} ovum, signal transduction occurs, resulting in an increase of cytoplasmic calcium ions. This itself triggers the cortical reaction, which results in depositing several substances onto the <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane</b> through exocytosis of the cortical granules, transforming it into a hard layer called the “fertilization membrane”, {{which serves as a}} barrier inaccessible to other spermatozoa. This phenomenon is the slow block to polyspermy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane</b> or vitelline {{envelope}} is {{a structure}} surrounding the outer {{surface of the}} plasma membrane of an ovum (the oolemma) or, in some animals (e.g., birds), the extracellular yolk and the oolemma. It is composed mostly of protein fibers, with protein receptors needed for sperm binding which, in turn, are bound to sperm plasma membrane receptors. The species-specificity between these receptors contributes to prevention of breeding between different species.|$|E
50|$|The yolk mass, {{together}} with the egg cell or ovum properly (after fertilization, the embryo) are enclosed by the <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane,</b> whose structure is different from a cell membrane.

50|$|The chorion is the {{outermost}} fetal membrane around the embryo in mammals, birds and reptiles. It develops from an outer fold {{on the surface}} of the yolk sac, which lies outside the zona pellucida (in mammals), known as the <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane</b> in other animals. In insects it is developed by the follicle cells while the egg is in the ovary. The main function of the chorion is to protect and nurture the embryo.|$|E
50|$|After {{finding the}} egg, the sperm penetrates the jelly coat {{through a process}} called sperm activation. In another ligand/receptor interaction, an {{oligosaccharide}} component of the egg binds and activates a receptor on the sperm and causes the acrosomal reaction. The acrosomal vesicles of the sperm fuse with the plasma membrane and are released. In this process, molecules bound to the acrosomal vesicle membrane, such as bindin, are exposed {{on the surface of}} the sperm. These contents digest the jelly coat and eventually the <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane.</b> In addition to the release of acrosomal vesicles, there is explosive polymerisation of actin to form a thin spike at the head of the sperm called the acrosomal process.|$|E
50|$|The zona pellucida, a {{thick layer}} of {{extracellular}} matrix that surrounds the egg and is similar {{to the role of the}} <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane</b> in sea urchins, binds with the sperm. Unlike sea urchins, the sperm binds to the egg before the acrosomal reaction. ZP3, a glycoprotein in the zona pellucida, is responsible for egg/sperm adhesion in mice. The receptor galactosyltransferase (GalT) binds to the N-acetylglucosamine residues on the ZP3 and is important for binding with the sperm and activating the acrosome reaction. ZP3 is sufficient though unnecessary for sperm/egg binding. Two additional sperm receptors exist: a 250kD protein that binds to an oviduct secreted protein, and SED1, which independently binds to the zona. After the acrosome reaction, the sperm is believed to remain bound to the zona pellucida through exposed ZP2 receptors. These receptors are unknown in mice but have been identified in guinea pigs.|$|E
50|$|Whipworm eggs have thick, lemon-shaped, {{light yellow}} shells.

The actual egg is covered by a <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane.</b> When the egg first exits the uterus of their mother, they are composed solely of yolk granules. Over a period of 72 hours, the egg undergoes mitotic division into two blastomeres that are separated by a transverse cleavage. Two additional cleavages occur within at least 96 hours so that the egg is now composed of four cells. Cellular division continues in this manner and the morula stage is reached within the next week. After a total of 21-22 days, the larva becomes fully developed and will not hatch until ingested by a host. The larva can be alive for a total of 6 months without the assistance of a host. The timeline of egg development can vary depending on the species.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane</b> is a {{specialized}} extracellular matrix that surrounds and protects the oocyte. Recent {{studies indicate that}} it {{also serves as a}} storage site for embryonic pattern determinants. sV 23, a major <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane</b> protein, is essential for the morphogenesis of the <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane</b> as sV 23 protein null mutants lay flaccid, infertile eggs. By analyzing a series of sV 23 mutant transgenes in the sV 23 protein null genetic background, we have shown that sV 23 is secreted as a proprotein in functional excess and that C- and N-terminal prodomains are removed successively, following its deposition in the extracellular space. Although a target site for subtilisin-like convertases is essential for N-terminal processing, N-terminal processing is not necessary for the assembly of a functional <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane</b> layer. While C-terminal truncations were tolerated, the removal of N-terminal sequences lead to the production of flaccid, infertile eggs with a soluble, rather than insoluble, <b>vitelline</b> <b>membrane</b> network.
