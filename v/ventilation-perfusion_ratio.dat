40|$|The coupled {{conservation}} of mass equations for oxygen, {{carbon dioxide and}} nitrogen are written down for a lung model consisting of two homogeneous alveolar compartments (with different ventilation-perfusion ratios) and a shunt compartment. As inspired oxygen concentration and oxygen consumption are varied, the flux of oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen across the alveolar membrane in each compartment varies. The result {{of this is that}} the expired <b>ventilation-perfusion</b> <b>ratio</b> for each compartment becomes a function of inspired oxygen concentration and oxygen consumption as well as parameters such as inspired ventilation and alveolar perfusion. Another result is that the "inspired <b>ventilation-perfusion</b> <b>ratio</b> and the "expired <b>ventilation-perfusion</b> <b>ratio</b> differ significantly, under some conditions, for poorly ventilated lung compartments. As a consequence, we need to distinguish between the "inspired ventilation-perfusion distribution, which is independent of inspired oxygen concentration and oxygen consumption, and the "expired ventilation-perfusion distribution, which we now show to be strongly dependent on inspired oxygen concentration and less dependent oxygen consumption.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{bronchial}} occlusion on the pulmonary circulation were studied in anesthetized cats and dogs. Immediately after occlusion, blood flow fell rapidly at normal pulmonary arterial pressure (— 71 % cats, — 54 % dogs), and in constant flow perfusion experiments, perfusion pressure rose (+ 50 % cats, + 28 % dogs). These resistance changes were reversed by vasodilator drugs, alkali, or perfusion of the lung with arterial blood. We concluded that an active mechanism, probably {{an increase in}} vasomotor tone, was involved; a mechanical process would not be reversed in this way. Pulmonary venous Po 2 was the factor most {{closely related to the}} increase in resistance. In collapsing "oxygen-filled " lobes, compared with "air-filled " lobes the resistance change was delayed until the pulmonary venous Po 2 fell. Hypoventilation and ventilation with hypoxic mixtures causing a fall in pulmonary venous Po 2 similar to that due to collapse caused equivalent changes in blood flow. Changes in pH, Pco 2 and lung volume played a relatively minor role in resistance changes following collapse. The increase in resistance may be caused by a mechanism regulating <b>ventilation-perfusion</b> <b>ratios</b> in both normal and diseased lung.

40|$|Diseases of the {{pulmonary}} vasculature are {{a cause of}} increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in pulmonary embolism, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), and pulmonary arterial hypertension or decreased PVR in pulmonary arteriovenous malformations on hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, portal hypertension, or cavopulmonary anastomosis. All these conditions {{are associated with a}} decrease in both arterial PO 2 and PCO 2. Gas exchange in pulmonary vascular diseases with increased PVR is characterized by a shift of ventilation and perfusion to high <b>ventilation-perfusion</b> <b>ratios,</b> a mild to moderate increase in perfusion to low <b>ventilation-perfusion</b> <b>ratios,</b> and an increased physiologic dead space. Hypoxemia in these patients is essentially explained by altered ventilation-perfusion matching amplified by a decreased mixed venous PO 2 caused by a low cardiac output. Hypocapnia is accounted for by hyperventilation, which is essentially related to an increased chemosensitivity. A cardiac shunt on a patent foramen ovale may be a cause of severe hypoxemia in a proportion of patients with pulmonary hypertension and an increase in right atrial pressure. Gas exchange in pulmonary arteriovenous malformations is characterized by variable degree of pulmonary shunting and/or diffusion-perfusion imbalance. Hypocapnia is caused by an increased ventilation in relation to an increased pulmonary blood flow with direct peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation by shunted mixed venous blood flow. © 2011 American Physiological Society.

The lack of significant difference regarding this parameter between T 1, T 2 and T 3 does not support this hypothesis, along with the fact that most of the PP sessions with significant increase in GEDVI between T 1 and T 3 were associated with an increase in CI.

40|$|The {{evidence}} for existence of arteriovenous shunts {{in the normal}} human lung is strong but necessarily indirect. Simultaneous measurements of oxygen tension in alveolar air and in arterial blood consistently show a degree of venous admixture in both normal and abnormal subjects (1), but no information has been obtained about the path taken by this unventilated blood. The passage of small glass or plastic beads through the pulmonary circulation has demonstrated potential pathways as large as 200 ju in diameter (2, 3), but this technique involves an artificial distention of the vascular bed and gives no information {{about the extent to}} which such pathways may function physiologically. The present investigation was based on the hypothesis that the decreased venous inflow to the right atrium and reduced blood flow through the pulmonary vessels during the Valsalva maneuver, as well as the rebound effects after release of the maneuver, might alter the flow through such shunts, and that this alteration could be detected by continuous measurement of the systemic arterial oxygen saturation.

Ventilation was commonly decreased towards the base of the lung, that is the reverse of the normal pattern.

Multipoint Ppa/Q plots were generated by a manipulation of venous return before and 60 min after sufficient amounts of small (1 mm, n = 6 dogs), medium (5 mm, n = 6 dogs), or large (10 mm, n = 6 dogs) clots to increase Ppa to 50 mmHg. The distribution of VA/Q was determined by the multiple inert gas elimination technique at the same intermediate Q in each of these experimental conditions. All three sizes of emboli resulted in an 82 - 92 % mean angiographic pulmonary vascular obstruction and increased both the extrapolated pressure intercepts and the slopes of the linear Ppa/Q plots. Gas exchange was altered the most after large clots, which were associated with lower arterial pH, higher physiological and inert gas dead spaces, higher dispersion of ventilation, and also lower mean VA/Q of perfusion distributions. In contrast, inert gas dead space was decreased after small clots.

40|$|It has {{recently}} become apparent {{that a high}} proportion of individuals who possess S type he-moglobin exhibit significant desaturation of the arterial blood. In 1942 Klinefelter (1) found arterial oxygen saturations of 89 and 91 per cent in two patients, and in 1943 Reinhard, Moore, Dubach, and Wade (2) found values ranging from 74. 2 to 90. 8 per cent saturation in one pa-tient with sickle cell disease. Leight, Snider, Clifford, and Hellems (3) studied 13 patients with sickle cell disease in 1954, 10 of whom had arterial 02 desaturation. Within the past year reports from this laboratory (4, 5) and from Jen-sen, Rucknagel, and Taylor (6) indicate that de-saturation of arterial blood exists in most people who possess S type hemoglobin. The exact mech-anism responsible for this phenomenon has not been elucidated. The various possibilities may be distinguished with fair accuracy by determining alveolar and arterial oxygen tensions and calculating A-a oxy-gen tension gradients at three levels of oxygena-tion. If desaturation is due to hypoventilation, no appreciable gradient exists at any level of oxy-genation and CO 2 retention is usually evident. Any increase in A-a gradient must, therefore, be due to some other mechanism. Lilienthal, Riley, Proemmel, and Franke (7) suggested that one might distinguish between a diffusion defect and veno-arterial admixture by measurement of the effective alveolar-arterial gradient at two levels of oxygenation, one of which produces significant desaturation of arterial blood. Low levels of in-spired 02 (12 to 14 per cent) exaggerate the ef-fects of impaired diffusion and minimize the ef-fects of veno-arterial admixture. Veno-arterial admixture, thus delineated, may be either through actual anatomical communications, or the result of reduction in the <b>ventilation-perfusion</b> <b>ratios...</b>|$|R

Methods Seven Standardbred trotter horses aged 3 – 7 years and weighing 380 – 520 kg, were studied. The protocol consisted of three consecutive measurements; in the unsedated horse, after intravenous administration of detomidine (0. 02 mg/kg) and after subsequent butorphanol administration (0. 025 mg/kg). Pulmonary function and haemodynamic effects were investigated. The distribution of <b>ventilation-perfusion</b> <b>ratios</b> (V A /Q) was estimated with MIGET. Results During detomidine sedation, arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2) decreased (12. 8 ± 0. 7 to 10. 8 ± 1. 2 kPa) and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2) increased (5. 9 ± 0. 3 to 6. 1 ± 0. 2 kPa) compared to measurements in the unsedated horse. Mismatch between ventilation and perfusion in the lungs was evident, but no increase in intrapulmonary shunt could be detected. Respiratory rate and minute ventilation did not change. Heart rate and cardiac output decreased, while pulmonary and systemic blood pressure and vascular resistance increased. Addition of butorphanol resulted in a significant decrease in ventilation and increase in PaCO 2. Alveolar-arterial oxygen content difference P(A-a) O 2 remained impaired after butorphanol administration, the V A /Q distribution improved as the decreased ventilation and persistent low blood flow was well matched.

Of particular note in the flounder, relative to the trout, are low arterial and venous Po. ' 8 > a l ° w arterial-venous O 2 content difference, a low transfer factor and high diffusion gradient for O 2 across the gills, a high m vivo blood Oa affinity, a high cardiac output and stroke volume accompanied by a low peripheral vascular resistance, a low venti-lation volume, a low <b>ventilation-perfusion</b> <b>ratio,</b> and a low capacity-rate ratio for Og exchange at the gills. Parameters of CO 2 transport and acid-base regulation appear conventional, though blood CO 2 contents and lactate concentrations are low. The respiratory strategies of inactive versus active, and benthic versus pelagic teleosts are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundDiaphragmatic {{paralysis}} is a pathology {{characterized by}} the elevation of a plastic and inactive atrophic diaphragm, followed by an injury to the spinal column or to the phrenic nerve. Because it involves the phrenic nerve, it {{is often associated with}} an injury at its exit in the spinal cord at the radicular level, at the conduct or in the peripheral nerve. Clinical caseA 50 -year-old male patient with a history of thoracic trauma and diagnosis of unstable thorax is admitted for progressive dyspnea in the following 8 months. Diaphragmatic paralysis is diagnosed and a laparoscopic diaphragmatic plicature is performed. Patient improved his clinical status by 29 %. DiscussionThe consequences of the elevation of a hemidiaphragm can be respiratory, causing hypoxemia and decreases in the <b>ventilation–perfusion</b> <b>ratio.</b> This procedure is considered a corrective surgery from the morphological and functional point of view. ConclusionsOur patient's clinical status improved according to the Saint George respiratory questionnaire, thanks to an improved perfusion of the basal lung expansion. Laparoscopic diaphragmatic plicature is a safe procedure associated with a minimal hospital stay, and more cases need to be reported. This is the procedure of choice in our institution...|$|E
40|$|The {{pulmonary}} circulation {{differs from the}} systemic in several important aspects, the most important being that pulmonary arteries constrict to moderate physiological (∼ 20 – 60 mmHg PO 2) hypoxia, whereas systemic arteries vasodilate. This phenomenon is called hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), and is responsible for maintaining the <b>ventilation–perfusion</b> <b>ratio</b> during localized alveolar hypoxia. In disease, however, global hypoxia results in a detrimental increase in total pulmonary vascular resistance, and increased load on the right heart. Despite many years of study, the precise mechanisms underlying HPV remain unresolved. However, as we argue below, there is now overwhelming evidence that hypoxia can stimulate several pathways leading to {{a rise in the}} intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC). This rise in [Ca 2 +]i is consistently found to be relatively small, and HPV seems also to require rho kinase-mediated Ca 2 + sensitization. There is good evidence that HPV also has an as yet unexplained endothelium dependency. In this brief review, we highlight selected recent findings and ongoing controversies which continue to animate the study of this remarkable and unique response of the pulmonary vasculature to hypoxia...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} for measuring virtually continuous distributions of <b>ventilation-perfusion</b> <b>ratios</b> (V̇A/Q̇) based on the steadystate elimination of six gases of different solubilities. The method is applied here to 12 normal subjects, aged 21 — 60. In nine, the distributions were compared breathing air and 100 % oxygen, while in the remaining three, effects of changes in posture were examined. In four young semirecumbent subjects (ages 21 — 24) the distributions of blood flow and ventilation with respect to V̇A/Q̇ were virtually log-normal with little dispersion (mean log standard deviations 0. 43 and 0. 35, respectively). The 95. 5 % range of both blood flow and ventilation was from V̇A/Q̇ ratios of 0. 3 — 2. 1, {{and there was no}} intrapulmonary shunt (V̇A/Q̇ of 0). On breathing oxygen, a shunt developed in three of these subjects, the mean value being 0. 5 % of the cardiac output. The five older subjects (ages 39 — 60) had broader distributions (mean log standard deviations, 0. 76 and 0. 44) containing areas with V̇A/Q ratios in the range 0. 01 — 0. 1 in three subjects. As for the young subjects, there was no shunt breathing air, but all five developed a shunt breathing oxygen (mean value 3. 2 %), and in one the value was 10. 7 %. Postural changes were generally those expected from the known effects of gravity, with more ventilation to high VA/Q areas when the subjects were erect than supine. Measurements of the shunt while breathing oxygen, the Bohr CO 2 dead space, and the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference were all consistent with the observed distributions. Since the method involves only a short infusion of dissolved inert gases, sampling of arterial blood and expired gas, and measurement of cardiac output and minute ventilation, we conclude that it is well suited to the investigation of pulmonary gas exchange in man...|$|R
40|$|We studied CO, and {{inert gas}} {{elimination}} in the isolated in situ trachea {{as a model}} of conducting airway gas exchange. Six inert gases with various solubilities and molecular weights (MW) were infused into the left atria of six pentobarbital-an-esthetized dogs (group 1). The unidirectionally ventilated tra-chea behaved as a high <b>ventilation-perfusion</b> unit (<b>ratio</b> = 60) with no appreciable dead space. Excretion of higher-MW gases appeared to be depressed, suggesting a MW dependence to in-ert gas exchange. This was further explored in another six dogs (group 2) with three gases of nearly equal solubility but widely divergent MWs (acetylene, 26; Freon- 22, 86. 5; isoflurane, 184. 5). Isoflurane and Freon- 22 excretions were depressed 47 and 30 %, respectively, relative to acetylene. In a theoretical model of airway gas exchange, neither a tissue nor a gas phase diffusion resistance predicted our results better than the stan...|$|R
40|$|Single photon {{emission}} computed tomography, a rotating gamma camera, and continuous inhalation or infusion of krypton 81 m (half life 13 seconds) {{were used to}} measure regional ventilation (V), perfusion (Q), and <b>ventilation-perfusion</b> (V/Q) <b>ratios</b> in five normal subjects in supine, prone, and lateral decubitus postures and in three asthmatic patients (supine posture only) before and after inhalation of 2. 5 mg nebulised salbutamol. Vertical and horizontal gradients of V, Q, and V/Q were examined at three levels in each lung in regions of 1. 9 cm 3 size. In normal subjects V and Q increased along the axis of gravity in all postures and at all levels in the lung except for V in the prone position. Smaller horizontal gradients were found {{with an increase in}} V and Q from caudal to cranial [...] again except in the prone posture, where the gradient was slightly reversed. Constraint to outward motion of the ventral chest and abdominal wall is the most likely explanation for the different behaviour in the prone posture. In chronic asthma the vertical gradients of V and V/Q were the reverse of normal, but the Q gradient was normal. Bronchodilator treatment did not affect the vertical or horizontal gradients significantly, but analysis of individual regions showed that, relatively, V/Q worsened in 42 % of them; this was associated in two thirds with an increase in fractional Q. After inhalation of beta agonist local vasodilatation may influence V/Q ratios in some units more than bronchodilatation...|$|R
