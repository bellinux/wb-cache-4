5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> <b>So</b> I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E
25|$|Traditional dishes include caruru, vatapá, acarajé, bobó-de-camarão, moqueca baiana, and abará. Some {{of these}} dishes, like the acarajé and abará, {{are also used}} as {{offering}}s in Candomblé rituals. But Salvador is not only typical food. Other recipes created by the slaves were the Haussá Rice (rice and jerked beef cooked together), the Munguzá, used as offering to the Candomblé deity Oxalá (who {{is the father of}} all deities, according to the religion) pleased the matrons <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> <b>So</b> did the Bolinhos the Fubá, the Cuscuz (cornmeal) and the Mingau (porridge). According to Arany Santana, the African Ipetê (used in the rituals to the deity Oxum) became the Shrimp bobó, and the Akará (honoring the deities Xangô and Iansã) became the world-famous Acarajé. The city has restaurants specialized on international cuisine also. There are also places that serve dishes from other states of Brazil, especially from Minas Gerais and the Northeast region.|$|E
500|$|Reaction to {{the episode}} was split. While the {{majority}} of reviewers were favorably impressed, some <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>so,</b> a significant minority were disappointed at the message the episode conveyed and the storytelling decisions. Among the former were Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic, who described it as [...] "Glee at its best: cartoonish, outlandish, and loud—but still oh-so true to life." [...] IGN's Robert Canning gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] rating of 8 out of 10, and called the main storyline [...] "comical and human". Candace Bulter of ScreenCrave also gave the episode an 8 out of 10, and wrote, [...] "This week's Glee puts on the beer goggles to put alcohol-related issues in perspective. The result is humorous and ironic, but leaves something to be wanted." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club, wrote that [...] "the underpinnings of the episode aren't terrible, just overstuffed" [...] {{and gave it a}} [...] "B−". MTV's Aly Semigran stated that the episode [...] "left something of a sour taste", and added that while the show [...] "always combines humor with serious life lessons, it seems there were none to be found here"; she called the episode [...] "a wasted opportunity". BuddyTV Jen Harper was also disenchanted by the episode, and concluded, [...] "Geez Louise, Glee. What's happened to you?" [...] Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times saw the show's message differently from Semigran, and wrote, [...] "Leave it to Glee to tackle a potentially joyless, didactic topic like teenage drinking and somehow manage to entertain and surprise and get its important life lessons across." [...] Time Richard Corliss called it a [...] "breezy, sharply written episode" [...] and rated it in the [...] "high-middle range" [...] for the show. He concluded, [...] "Last night’s hour of Glee was of the level a superior series sticks in mid-season between its 'important' episodes. If this is coasting, take me along for the ride." ...|$|E

60|$|Of course Jimmy Skunk was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{surprised}} and <b>very</b> <b>much</b> interested, <b>so</b> Johnny Chuck told him all about it.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the longer}} term, the creedless and liberal liturgy of the Octagon Chapel formed a {{starting}} point for the beliefs and writings of Anna Aikin (later Anna Barbauld) who was brought up at Warrington Academy, her father John Aikin being a tutor there and on Seddon's side of the debate. [...] The liturgy was however condemned by others, following Orton's verdict: [...] "It is scarcely a Christian Liturgy; in the Collects the name of Christ is hardly mentioned, and the Spirit is quite banished from it"; and elsewhere [...] "Grieved I am, and <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>so,</b> to see such an almost deistical composition", an opinion followed in Charles Buck's Theological Dictionary (c.1820).|$|E
2500|$|The Duchess, {{contrary}} to considerable {{criticism in the}} art world, highly praised the portrait, after viewing it initially in a private family gathering. She remarked, [...] "I thought it was brilliant. It's just amazing. Absolutely brilliant". She particularly praised the nose and mouth. Richard Stone, the most prolific of Royal portrait painters, praised the painting in that it captured Catherine's true warmth, saying [...] "I liked it, <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>so.</b> So often with official portraits they can be rather stiff and starchy, but this has a lovely informality about it, and a warmth to it. It was jolly brave of him to paint it well over lifesize, because that's extremely difficult. It's very challenging to do something larger than life, {{and he seems to}} have pulled it off very well." [...] Royal Society of Portrait Painters president Alistair Adams suggested that there [...] "are no airs and graces, there's no background context to allude to success or power – it's very much on a level of one to one with the viewer. It's quite natural, it's open, it's straightforward and very pure – it's immediate and not overly sentimental." [...] Stephen Deuchar, director of The Art Fund, called it a [...] "captivating contemporary image".|$|E

5000|$|The police soon {{discovered}} that the mother was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> still alive. <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>so,</b> that she even joined Dehn in taunting the attending police officers with comments such as [...] "Nazi's" [...] and [...] "Gestapo".|$|R
60|$|THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: <b>Very</b> <b>much</b> <b>so!</b> I'll make it hot for you. I'll {{make you}} dance Jack Latten for that.|$|E

60|$|Phonny {{thought that}} he was sinking himself in his cousin's {{estimation}} by this avowal, but he was in fact raising himself <b>very</b> <b>much</b> by evincing <b>so</b> <b>much</b> honesty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you see it?" [...] I asked him, taking {{particular}} note of his face. His {{eyes were}} prominent and strained, but not <b>very</b> <b>much</b> more <b>so,</b> perhaps, {{than my own}} had been when I had directed them earnestly towards the same spot.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may have}} {{observed}} the same wheel-tracks going the other way. But the outward-bound ones were <b>very</b> <b>much</b> deeper--so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> {{that we can}} say for a certainty {{that there was a}} very considerable weight on the carriage." ...|$|R

6000|$|Rollo {{liked this}} plan <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> <b>So</b> Rudolf, having {{arranged}} every thing, wished Rollo a [...] "good voyage," [...] {{and went off}} in the boat as he came.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, very {{imprudent}} indeed, Master Copperfield,' returned Uriah, sighing modestly. 'Oh, <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>so!</b> But I wish you'd call me Uriah, if you please. It's {{like old}} times.' ...|$|E
60|$|Harold {{took this}} offer <b>very</b> seriously, <b>much</b> more <b>so</b> than Mr. Burns {{intended}} he should do, {{although he was}} pleased with the boy.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{want to see}} him,' said Marie. Lady Carbury, hardly {{knowing what}} answer to make, {{was silent for a}} while. 'I suppose he told you everything;--didn't he? You know that we were to have been married? I loved him <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> and <b>so</b> I do still. I am not ashamed of coming and telling you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am," [...] said Austin. [...] "In fact, I'm <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>so,</b> indeed. You see, I had {{practically}} nothing on, {{and he got}} his festering arms round me." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{interested}} Ozma, of course, but it didn't interest Dorothy <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> <b>so</b> {{the little}} girl ran over to a big table on which was lying open Glinda's Great Book of Records.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>so</b> indeed, my Lady!" [...] the Professor hastily replied, unconsciously {{rubbing his}} ear, while some painful {{recollection}} seemed to cross his mind. [...] "I was very forcibly struck by His Magnificence, I assure you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No! Oh! {{it was the}} relief!' said Theodora, {{throwing}} off her shawl, as if to free herself from oppression. Percy took it from her, placed her in the arm-chair, and rendered her all the little attentions in his power {{with a sort of}} trembling eagerness, still silent; for she was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> exhausted,--not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> from present agitation as from the previous strain on mind and body.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot deny," [...] said Claude, [...] "that {{such things}} as presentiments may be possible.

60|$|Ida {{watched the}} door close and then leant her arm on the mantelpiece, and {{reflected}} {{that she liked}} Colonel Quaritch <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> <b>so</b> much that even his not very beautiful physiognomy did not repel her, indeed rather attracted her than otherwise.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all. She's amusing {{and that}} and {{moderate}} good looks are all {{you expect from}} a woman, {{so long as you}} don't mean to marry her. I'm interested in your friend; <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>so,</b> although I can't see her game." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so," [...] said Claude, [...] "but I cannot {{deny that}} {{such things as}} presentiments may be possible.

5000|$|Many {{people find}} it {{difficult}} to see Haidinger's brush initially. It is <b>very</b> faint, <b>much</b> more <b>so</b> than generally indicated in illustrations, and, like other stabilized images, tends to appear and disappear.|$|R
50|$|The Lek was {{normally}} at {{a slightly}} higher level than the canal leading to Utrecht and henk and in times of flood was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> higher, <b>so</b> {{that it would not}} be possible to let boats enter or leave without flooding the surrounding land. The additional gate limited the amount of water that needed to be let in, so that only the basin needed to be raised.|$|R
