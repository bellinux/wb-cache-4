40|$|Empirical {{research}} has shown that shareholders’ agreements in listed companies in the Republic of Lithuania are used quite often. Though the broad concept of shareholders’ agreements is not stipulated by the legislator of Lithuania, the Civil Code contains provisions regarding <b>voting</b> <b>agreement</b> and transfer of voting rights agreement. Due to this reason the article analyses the aforementioned agreements in detail. Legal evaluation of the agreements and legal consequences caused by entering into contractual relationships are also presented. Both the <b>voting</b> <b>agreement</b> and the transfer of voting rights agreement have similar aims – to empower shareholders to contract for more effective government of the company. Author analyses the prohibitions to agree on certain provisions of the agreements in question. It is shown that all the statutory prohibitions that are applied to the <b>voting</b> <b>agreement</b> should also be applied to the transfer of voting rights agreement. Taking into account the practice in other states these prohibitions should be interpreted broadly...|$|E
40|$|Shareholders’ {{agreement}} {{is one of}} the most popular contractual legal measures that enable shareholders of Belgian listed companies to regulate their relationships in the context of corporate governance. In contrast, the UK shareholders are less determined to enter into the shareholders’ agreement. The article analyses the concept of <b>voting</b> <b>agreement</b> and securities lending agreement in Belgium and the UK, provides comparative insights with the Lithuanian legislation. Legal assessment of the aforementioned agreements is presented in the article. <b>Voting</b> <b>agreement</b> enables shareholders to coordinate their actions and to implement common governance policy in the company. Though there are no provisions regarding the transfer of voting rights agreement stipulated in the laws of Belgium or the UK similar legal consequences are achieved by entering into securities lending agreements. These agreements provide a possibility for a borrower to use the voting rights attached to the securities. Article concludes that legislators should focus on aspects of regulation of voting and securities lending agreements...|$|E

Prior research associates termination provisions in merger agreements with reduced {{competition in the}} takeover bidding process. We find that this result stems from an artificially narrow depiction of takeover competition. Using a novel dataset on the private takeover process employed {{in a sample of}} 400 major acquisitions announced in the 1990 s, we find {{that the majority of the}} targets are sold in a competitive environment with multiple potential bidders. Moreover, we find that the targets sold in a competitive auction are more likely to employ a termination provision than targets sold in one-to-one negotiation with a single bidder. These results indicate that termination provisions culminate, rather than truncate, the takeover bidding process. In our cross-sectional analysis, we also report new evidence on the factors affecting the granting of termination provisions. We find that the likelihood that a bidder is granted a termination provision is inversely related to the presence of an ownership affiliation or share <b>voting</b> <b>agreement</b> in which a large target blockholder commits to vote in favor of the takeover. We find tha...|$|E

40|$|Textual {{information}} {{is an important}} communication medium contained rich expression of emotion, and emotion recognition on text has wide applications. Word emotion analysis is fundamental in the problem of textual emotion recognition. Through {{an analysis of the}} characteristics of word emotion expression, we use word emotion vector to describe the combined basic emotions in a word, which can be used to distinguish direct and indirect emotion words, express emotion ambiguity in words, and express multiple emotions in words. Based on Ren-CECps (a Chinese emotion corpus), we do an experiment to explore the role of emotion word for sentence emotion recognition and we find that the emotions of a simple sentence (sentence without negative words, conjunctions, or question mark) can be approximated by an addition of the word emotions. Then MaxEnt modeling is used to find which context features are effective for recognizing word emotion in sentences. The features of word, N-words, POS, Pre-N-words emotion, Pre-is-degree-word, Pre-is-negativeword, Pre-is-conjunction and their combination have been experimented. After that, we use the two metrics: Kappa coefficient of agreement and <b>Voting</b> <b>agreement</b> to measure the word annotation agreement of Ren-CECps. The experiments on above context features showed promising results compared with word emotion agreement on people’s judgments. 1...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the fields}} of electoral studies and {{legislative}} politics, the interest {{of this study is}} the Brazilian electoral system and the unity of the parties it produces. Specifically, I ask how post-electoral intraparty rank affects party unity. I determine post-electoral intraparty rank by comparing deputies’ vote share of the total national vote count. By compiling a database of 48 roll-call votes of 37 Federal Deputies from São Paulo, I compare how often the deputies toe the party line to their vote share. I also test for the geographical concentration of votes in cases where I find it relevant. My hypothesis is that deputies elected with a low vote share will vote according to their party’s recommendation to a larger degree than those deputies with a strong electoral base. I find that, based only on roll-call vote analysis, the complete sample does not demonstrate a strong relationship between <b>voting</b> <b>agreement</b> and vote share (or post-electoral rank). However, by analyzing significant cases individually, I do find a basis for my hypothesis, as well as indicators of theoretical consistency in the sample. The basis is for the most part strengthened when controlling for vote concentration. I conclude that deputies whose largest electoral base is centered in cities seem to be more autonomous in their voting, most likely for ideological reasons rather than reasons motivated by pork-barrel spending...|$|E

The main analysis concerned the correlations between the students' credibility rating and the community votes the answers had received. Results. Findings showed that across subjects and knowledge levels, the availability of cues increased the level of agreement between the test subjects and the community aggregate <b>vote.</b> <b>Agreement</b> with answerer reputation was weaker but still significant. Furthermore, at low knowledge levels cue visibility increased confidence regarding credibility judgements. Conclusions. The findings are discussed within a framework of social epistemology, which provides a theoretical foundation for the assessment of knowledge systems.

(JEL G 3, G 32) Corporate governance scholars and regulators in the United States have tradi-tionally been concerned about protecting investors from managerial entrench-ment and expropriation—the classic agency problem described by Berle and Means (1932) and Jensen and Meckling (1976). Yet, a growing body of liter-ature has shifted attention toward a different agency problem that seems to be of greater concern in most of the world: the expropriation of small investors by large controlling shareholders (Shleifer and Vishny 1997).

The thesis consists of a general and a special part. The objective of the general part is to describe the legal nature, effects, usual content and practical use of shareholders' agreements. Particularly, I intend to detail the main legal issues surrounding shareholders' agreements included in the constitutional documents and to suggest the methods of coping with these problems in the legal practice. Further, I will describe the corporate advantages of the shareholders' agreements as separate legal documents as well as their limits. The objective of the specific part of this thesis is to characterize the selected types of shareholders' agreements in terms of their practical use and legal regulation.
