500|$|As editing progressed, budget {{shortfalls}} prevented BSÉ from finalizing contracts. The organization also restricted post-production {{funds to}} [...] "limit [...] exposure" [...] {{in the event}} the project was not completed. Stoneman contacted a former colleague at the BBC, Nick Fraser, who had declined to help finance the film in 2001. Fraser was commissioning editor for the BBC's Storyville documentaries series. According to Stoneman, Fraser was [...] "still undecided", having been told {{by the head of}} BBC Two that [...] "we've done Chávez". Nevertheless, the BBC pre-purchased the film and in December 2002 received a rough cut. At the BBC's behest, the opening of the television version was made more dramatic. Fraser was unsure about the voice-over; he asked for a more [...] "opinionated" [...] narration that, according to Bartley, would [...] "get the boot in". Although the BBC did not ask outright, Bartley's impression was that the organization wanted the film to be [...] "against Chávez".

Only three people I know figured out it was even me when they saw it." [...] Actor and musician Johnny Depp guest starred in the episode [...] "SpongeBob vs. The Big One" [...] as the voice of Jack Kahuna Laguna, a surf guru that taught SpongeBob how to surf. According to Sarah Noonan, vice president of talent and casting for Nickelodeon, Depp accepted the role because he and his kids are fans of the show.

I flipped at the opportunity to be in the show. I have four kids, and everybody loved SpongeBob." [...] In the entry [...] "The Clash of Triton", English singer Victoria Beckham guest starred in the episode as the wife of King Neptune, Queen Amphitrite.

2500|$|The {{autonomous}} {{nature of}} Section One allowed {{the writers of}} this series freedom to explore areas not usually associated with this genre on television. Nikita's <b>voice-over</b> <b>in</b> Season One establishes the Machiavellian motif of Section One. While founded as a counterterrorism organization (traditionally represented within fiction as good), Section One uses (as a standard) immoral means to achieve its objectives, while still citing efficiency and [...] "service of the greater good" [...] as justification for its actions. Its standardized implementation of draconian measures includes the use (upon both terrorist and innocent) of intimidation, torture ("The White Room"), murder ("cancellation"), assassination, abduction, suicide operatives ("abeyance" [...] operatives), false imprisonment, and terrorist co-operation. In one early episode, for example, in exchange for crucial information Section One hands a woman over to a sadist knowing she will be carved up.|$|E
