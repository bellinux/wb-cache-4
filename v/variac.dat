2500|$|On {{the dial}} you could crank {{it up to}} 140 volts or down to zero.

50|$|The {{induction}} regulator {{is similar}} in design to a wound-rotor induction motor but it is essentially a transformer whose output voltage is varied by rotating its secondary relative to the primary—i.e., rotating the angular position of the rotor.

The major advantage of the induction regulator is that unlike <b>variacs,</b> they are practical for transformers over 5 kVA. Hence, such regulators find widespread use in high-voltage laboratories.|$|R
50|$|Power {{control for}} the system can be {{achieved}} by a variety of methods. Many latter day units feature thyristor power control which works by means of a full wave AC (alternating current) drive varying the primary voltage to the input transformer. More traditional methods include three phase <b>variacs</b> (autotransformer) or motorised Brentford type voltage regulators to control the input voltage. Another very popular method was to use a two part tank coil with a primary and secondary winding separated by an air gap. Power control was affected by varying the magnetic coupling of the two coils by physically moving them relative to each other.|$|R

50|$|Because {{driving the}} power valves this hard also means maximum volume, {{which can be}} {{difficult}} to manage in a small recording or rehearsal space, many solutions have emerged that in some way divert some of this power valve output from the speakers, and allow the player to generate power valve distortion without excessive volume. These include built-in or separate power attenuators and power-supply-based power attenuation, such as a VVR, or Variable Voltage Regulator to drop the voltage on the valves' plates, to increase distortion whilst lowering volume. Guitarists such as Edward Van Halen have been known to use <b>variacs</b> before VVR technology was invented. Lower-power valve amps (such as a quarter-watt or less), speaker isolation cabinets, and low-efficiency guitar speakers are also used to tame the volume.|$|R

50|$|A {{different}} approach, using a <b>Variac</b> or a power scaling circuit, {{reduces the}} B+ supply voltage {{available to the}} power tubes thus producing power tube distortion at a reduced level such that all available output power {{is sent to the}} guitar speaker.

In a power scaling circuit, by decreasing just the B+ plate voltage, the cathode bias and screen grid voltage decrease proportionately, while the filament voltage stays constant. However the term power attenuator may be a misnomer for this type of power control because lowering B+ voltage tends to increase distortion, whereas according to convention, an attenuator should not introduce distortion.|$|E

50|$|One anecdote {{that should}} be {{interesting}} to longtime fans {{is the story of}} Van Halen’s aforementioned custom Marshall amp, rumored to have been rebuilt from scratch. As he explains it, after the band suffered through a disastrous radio interview where Eddie couldn’t think of anything to say, David Lee Roth advised him, “Here’s what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna lie. You’re gonna make up some s— so they don’t remember it.” So when he was asked about the amp during a later Guitar Player interview, he followed Roth’s advice.As it turns out, Van Halen picked up a secondhand amp without understanding the wiring — “I had my 100-volt Marshall. I bought one through the recycling or the newspaper that was from England, and it was set on 220 volts.

So, my <b>Variac,</b> my variable transformer was my volume knob. Too loud, knob turning sound I’d lower it down to 50.The problem, as Van Halen admits now, is that when he talked to Guitar Player, he followed Roth’s advice and invented a more rock ‘n’ roll version of the truth:I told people the complete opposite. I told them I raised it up 140 volts. I felt so bad. I felt so f—ing horrible, man. They said, “Please don’t attempt what Eddie Van Halen said in the last interview, because everyone was blowing their amps.” Everyone fried their amps ’cause of me. I felt so bad. I never lied again after that. For Van Halen I, a single Celestion speaker cabinet was used, and a <b>variac</b> set to around 90 volts was used on Van Halen's main 100 watt Marshall head, mainly to lower the amplifier's volume.

50|$|Some {{machines}} (such as {{a sewing}} machine motor) require partial or variable power. In the past, control (such as in {{a sewing machine}}'s foot pedal) was implemented by use of a rheostat connected in series with the motor to adjust the amount of current flowing through the motor. It was an inefficient scheme, as this also wasted power as heat in the resistor element of the rheostat, but tolerable because the total power was low. While the rheostat {{was one of several}} methods of controlling power (see autotransformers and <b>Variac</b> for more info), a low cost and efficient power switching/adjustment method was needed. This mechanism also needed to be able to drive motors for fans, pumps and robotic servos, and needed to be compact enough to interface with lamp dimmers.

40|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of morphine, when used clinically, is the constancy of its action. In the absence of tolerance, a given dose of morphine can be depended on to give a definite result. With one or two exceptions, this is true regardless of the nature or the anatomical location of the pain, unless this is so severe as to be beyond control by the drug. There is some individual variation in the side effects but the main analgesic action is quite constant. When the pain-threshold-raising action of mor-phine is studied by the Hardy-Wolff technique (1), taking care to avoid the development of tolerance, a fairly constant response is again ob-served (2). The effects are not identical in each individual tested, but are of the same order of magnitude. This report presents results obtained from pain threshold measurements, using morphine and 7 of its derivatives, in a group of men who had been addicted to opiates but who had received no regular doses of these drugs for at least 6 months prior to the study.

Poor and instability of power supply delivery in Nigeria necessitated {{the need for a}} device that can stabilize voltage, protect equipment from damages and also provide power to the loads in the absences of electricity from the utility mains. This need motivated the design of a power stabilizer (UPSz). Method of Pulse with modulation (PWM) was adopted. This method is capable of modulating a varying input to a stabilized output. Two input sources were considered; a fluctuating 220 V volt mains supply and a constant 12 V battery. The 12 V battery was rectified to provide an AC power supply to the load {{in the absence of the}} utility mains. The control circuit ensured a stabilized output voltage from input range of 140 V to 260 V AC power supply which is about ± 40 V to the usual supply voltage from the utility mains of 180 V- 220 V in Nigeria. Appropriate protection circuits were incorporated against surges to which ensured the safety of home/office appliances. A <b>variac</b> was used to obtain various AC voltage levels during the testing. The voltage and current results at different loadings (in watts) of the UPSz were obtained. These results were compared with those of commercially readily available offline UPS of the same rating.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThis paper first {{presents}} {{a summary of}} several old and new methods of measuring birefringence, indicating their limitations in respect to large optical glass blanks, and then explains in considerable detail the writers' new radiation method, which is free {{of many of these}} limitations. The procedure and theory of this new method are given here briefly. Procedure: A collimated beam of monochromatic (yellow - green) light is passed through a circular polarizer and then through the specimen to be measured, that is, a large optical glass blank, which is held stationary. The beam next passes through a plane-polarized analyzer, which may be rotated to permit maximum and minimum transmissions of the elliptically polarized light emerging from the specimen. The intensity of this transmitted light is indicated on an ammeter by means of a sensitive photocell and amplifier. Using a <b>variac,</b> the maximum intensity is adjusted to indicate a predetermined maximum position on the ammeter scale. The corresponding minimum position will then indicate the birefringence in terms of degrees of phase difference {{with the help of a}} special scale to be used in conjunction with the ammeter scale. The circular light emerging from the circular polarizer enables the optical blank under test to be placed in any arbitrary azimuth in respect to its principal directions thus eliminating the necessity for lining up the heavy optical blank. The necessity for lining up is one of the chief objections to previous methods as far as their use with large optical blanks is concerned. Theory: When the circular light from the circular polarizer passes through the specimen, the additional birefringence of the latter causes the beam to become elliptically polarized. Mathematical analysis of this elliptic light shows that the maximum and minimum intensities emerging from the rotatable plane analyzer determine by their ratio the birefringence of the specimen by the simple formula. SinΔφ=(A-B) /(A+B) =((A/B) - 1) /((A/B) + 1) where A is the maximum intensity, and B is the minimum, and Δφ is the birefringence of the specimen in terms of phase difference. This device is to be used to measure birefringence in optical blanks between 0 ° and 300 ° of phase-difference. Therefore, to distinguish between the four possible phase-differences associated with each absolute sine value on the scale, advantage is taken of the fact that the major axis of our birefringence ellipse is orientated in the first 180 ° (0 ° - 180 °) of specimen phase difference in a direction perpendicular to its orientation in the second 180 ° (180 ° - 360 °) of specimen phase-difference. Thus, if we note that our maximum intensity position occurs with the analyzers indicator clockwise to the specimen's "fast" axis in the one group (0 ° - 180 °) and anti-clockwise in the other group (180 ° - 360 °), we can distinguish between these two groups. Also, by inserting a rotatable 60 ° - retardation plate in the beam's path, we can determine the sum of the retardations, and on subsequent subtraction of the known 60 ° - retardation, this will leave only one sensible answer, thus distinguishing between the (0 ° - 90 °) group and the (90 ° - 180 °) group, or their equivalent groups between 180 ° and 360 °. By dividing the birefringence scale properly into upper and lower double groups of 90 ° span each, this procedure can be made reasonably simple. The "fast" axis of the optical blank at any point can be determined closely enough for the above purpose by the geometry of the round blank, (since principal directions are almost always radial and tangential), or else by previous qualitative examination. Due to light-leakage through Polaroid plates at "extinction" positions, zeroing of the device may be accomplished by means of a shutter with only fair accuracy (relative inaccuracy around 90 ° of phase-difference). However, by zeroing the ammeter through crossed plane-Polaroids, we allow for most or all of this leakage at all phase-differences. The principal advantage of the new method is the one previously suggested, namely, that we do not have to line up the heavy, bulk-y optical glass blank at each point to make the principal directions of the specimen coincide with those of the polarizer or analyzer. A second advantage over previous radiation methods is its full wave-length range. Another advantage is its simplicity of operation, at least for birefringence known to lie between 0 ° and 90 ° of phase-difference...|$|E

Part A: The Focusing Properties of Magnetic Analysers. The 1 M. V. and 500 KV. acaelerators of the Clarendon Laboratory provide relatively high current beams of positive ions which are very homogeneous in energy. For separating the ions of different masses a magnetic analyser is clearly necessary, since it can be shown that the alternative, an electrostatic analyser, gives energy dispersion only. The simple magnetic analyser which was customarily used until recently, being a sector shaped uniform field, has strong focussing properties in the plane containing the beam and perpendicular to the field lines (the "perpendicular" plane), but none in a plane containing the emergent beam and parallel to the field lines (the "parallel" plane). This focussing becomes stronger as the sector angle Φ is increased, until at 90 Â°, which is frequently a convenient angle, an incident collimated beam of circular cross-section converges to a line focus at the exit boundary. This is a great inconvenience in mnny cases where care has been taken with the accelerator to provide an intense ion beam for nuclear bombardment studies. The properties of such uniform sector fields are discussed briefly, since they serve to demonstrate the formal analogy between ion trajectories in magnetic fields (ion optics) and light optics. The power of the lens in the two planes can be changed by using a field which in non-uniform, varying with radial distance as H α r -n. Such a field focusses in both planess but it is shown that coincident foci can only be obtained at image distances too close to the magnet for practical convenience in many cases. The inherent non-uniformity of the "fringe" field at the pole boundaries can be used to change the power of the lens in both planes if the boundaries make an angle with the beam at entrance or exits. Expressions are derived for the image distances in both planes and the conditions for equality are then discussed. The equation has a variety of possible solutions which are to some extent limited by practical considerations. In particular, the magnification of the systme will in general increase with the increase of image distance and this proves to be the principal limiting factor, since the object for the ion-optical system has a finite size (initially the ion source canal). The theoretical results for a 90 ° analyser are compared with experiment and reasonable agreement is found. However it is found that there is a great loss of intensity in the analysed beam. the whole question of abberations is discussed and it is found that the loss of intensity is likely to be due to spherical abberation in the electron lens system, a circumstance that can probably not be improved in the existing type of accelerator column, and which makes 90 ° analyser of the type discussed of no great advantage over the uniform-sectpr field for many purposes. For an accelerator with large spherical aberration the only way out of this difficulty is to sacrifice the large dispersion and mechanical convenience of 90 ° deflection and use deflection through small angles. this is seperately considered as a special case of a field with oblique non-uniform boundaries, and the optical properties of such a magnet as is used in Part C are discussed. Part B: The Design of Magnets for Ion Analysers. The general considerations which guide the design of an analysing electromagnetic are presented, and details are given of the construction of a magnet and pole-pieces designed to give 90 ° deflection of l M. V. deutrons in either of the two opposite directions. The pole-pieces have faces which give the beam a 19 cm. radius path in the field, and freedom to choose the boundary angle (in accordance with the principles of Part A) is provided by the adjustable segments at the pole tips. The limitations on operation imposed by heating of the windings, non-uniformity of the field due to magnetic saturation and the proximity of the coils, and the effect of the hysteresis on field stabilisation are mentioned The vacuum box the carries the beam between the magnet poles is made of brass wave guide with a rigid supporting structure of Yorkshire tubing which also serves as a high speed pumping by-pass. The field is stabalised by referring the voltage developed by the magnet current across a resistance to that of a standard cell. The unbalance current is amplified by means of a galvanometer, modulated light beam, photocell and AC amplifier, and corrects the magnet current by a moter driven <b>variac</b> in the power supply before rectification. It is shown that a satisfactory magnet design can be based on triangular cores and windings. The dimensions of a magnet to deflect 1. 4 M. V. tritons through 90 ° in either of the two opposite directions are given, and also details of the tests, on a &frac 14; scale model, to find the temperature rise in the windings and the expected uniformity of the field in the full-size magnet. The field at various points in space near a triangular winding has been worked out. Part C: A Further Study of the D- D Reactors The angular distribution of the products of the two reactions: (a) D + D → He 3 + n (b) D + D → H 3 + p has been investigated in the energy range 150 KV. to 450 KV. (deuteron bombarding energy). Although other workers have made measurements of (a) in this region, the technique used was different, and the present work partly bridges the gap between the work of Eliot (0 to 50 KV.) and that of Blair (1 to 315 MV.), both of whom used similar methods. The apparatus consisted of a cylindrical target chamber filled with deuterium at a pressure of about 0. 1 mm. Hg., and attached {{to the end of the}} accelerator column of a 500 KV Phillips generator. the beam was carefully collimated by a canal system, and the charged reaction products from a small volume at the centre of the target box were counted by ion counters operated in the proportional region. Two counters were arranged to swivel about an axis through the centre of the reaction volume, and a third, which was used to monitor conditions, was fixed to the lid of the box. The counter windows were of very thin (about 0. 5 μ) quartz. The counter gas was heptane vapour at a pressure (about 1 cm.) determined by a fixed temperature bath. Counts were made of the number of He 3 and H,sup> 3 particles penetrating the counter window at various angles. These particles were distinguished by a careful choice of bias applied to a phase height disoriminato, and by the use of absorbing mica screens in front of the window. The principle is that the three charged particles from the reaction, as well as scattered deuterons, give in general different amounts of ionization in the counter materials and absorbers, because of their difference of energy and charge. the results to be expected are discussed in detail. The results are conveniently expressed in terms of the 'asymmetry' coefficients A and B in the expression for the angular distribution of the yields: Y α 1 + Acos 4 Ρ + Bcos 4 Ρ There is a significant difference in the values of A and B for reactions (a) and (b), which is in agreement with the results of other workers. The values are: He 3 H 3 E(KV) A B A B 150   1. 334 ± 0. 267    - 0. 087 ± 0. 294     0. 773 ± 0. 117     0. 031 ± 0. 130   200   1. 355 ± 0. 169     0. 155 ± 0. 183     0. 687 ± 0. 161     0. 297 ± 0. 130   260   1. 718 ± 0. 212     0. 186 ± 0. 245     0. 978 ± 0. 122     0. 149 ± 0. 150   350   1. 427 ± 0. 126     0. 711 ± 0. 145     0. 637 ± 0. 116     0. 839 ± 0. 130   450   1. 342 ± 0. 138     1. 371 ± 0. 157     0. 949 ± 0. 110     0. 506 ± 0. 130   The difficulties of interpretation of these results on the basis of the only published theoretical treatment of the D - D reaction is briefly discussed. </p...|$|E
