5|$|Michael Woodruff {{was born}} on 3 April 1911 in Mill Hill, London, England. In 1913, his father, Harold Woodruff, a {{professor}} of <b>veterinary</b> medicine at the Royal <b>Veterinary</b> College in London, moved the family to Australia so he could take up the post of Professor of <b>Veterinary</b> Pathology and Director of the <b>Veterinary</b> Institute at the University of Melbourne. The elder Woodruff later became the Professor of Bacteriology. The family's new life in Australia was interrupted by World War I, which prompted Harold to enlist in the armed services. He became {{an officer in the}} Australian Army <b>Veterinary</b> Corps and was sent to Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The second sub-book {{includes}} {{chapters on}} <b>veterinary</b> {{care of animals}} such as horses and elephants who served the army. Many <b>veterinary</b> ailments are described, ranging from fever to injury to stomach upsets, and the proper nourishment, care of the animals as well as formulations of medicines are outlined in the verses of chapter 2.6, for example. The text includes the names of over 40 herbs used for recipes of <b>veterinary</b> care.|$|E

5|$|As {{the college}} {{prepared}} for independence in 1953, Madgwick {{and his staff}} discussed establishing a farm-related degree program distinctive from the <b>veterinary</b> science degree offered at the University of Sydney. Madgwick journeyed to England and the United States to consult with agriculturalists, veterinarians, and specialists in animal husbandry. While Madgwick was gone, his deputy warden, James Belshaw, read a letter in the Australian <b>Veterinary</b> Journal from Gordon McClymont, a researcher in animal nutrition for the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, which advocated {{the establishment of a}} multi-disciplinary approach to farm science combining animal husbandry and agronomy.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin is {{sometimes}} used for pain relief {{or as an}} anticoagulant in <b>veterinary</b> medicine, primarily in dogs and sometimes horses, although newer medications with fewer side effects are generally used instead.|$|E

5|$|Dogs {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} research, testing, and education—particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and <b>veterinary</b> diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or <b>veterinary</b> use as a second species following testing in rodents, {{in accordance with the}} regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{problems}} are also possible in some Labradors, particularly progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts, corneal dystrophy and retinal dysplasia. Dogs which {{are intended to}} be bred should be examined by a <b>veterinary</b> ophthalmologist for an eye score.|$|E
5|$|Fleas have a {{significant}} economic impact. In America alone, approximately $2.8 billion is spent annually on flea-related <b>veterinary</b> bills and another $1.6 billion annually for flea treatment with pet groomers. Four billion dollars is spent annually for prescription flea treatment and $348 million for flea pest control.|$|E
5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is {{uncommon in}} Salukis, with the breed ranking joint lowest {{in a survey}} by the British <b>Veterinary</b> Association in 2003. The breed scored an average of 5 points, with a score of 0 being low, while 106 is high. In a 2006 breed specific survey conducted by The Kennel Club and the British Small Animal <b>Veterinary</b> Association Scientific Committee, responses highlighted several health issues. The primary cause of death identified was that of cancer, being responsible for 35.6% of deaths, with the most common forms being that of liver cancer or lymphoma. The secondary cause of death was cardiac related, with forms such as heart failure, or unspecified heart defects. Old age is listed as the third most frequent cause of death.|$|E
5|$|Many horses died as {{a result}} of the {{conditions}} at the front—of exhaustion, drowning, becoming mired in mud and falling in shell holes. Other horses were captured after their riders were killed. Horses also endured poor feeding and care, poison gas attacks that injured their respiratory systems and skin, and skin conditions such as mange. When gas warfare began in 1915, nose plugs were improvised for the horses to allow them to breathe during attacks. Later, several types of gas masks were developed by both the Central and Allied nations, although horses often confused them with feedbags and destroyed them. Soldiers found that better-bred horses were more likely to suffer from shell shock and act up when exposed to the sights and sounds of war than less-well-bred animals, who often learned to lie down and take cover at the sound of artillery fire. <b>Veterinary</b> hospitals were established to assist horses in recovering from shell shock and battle wounds, but thousands of equine corpses still lined the roads of the Western Front. In one year, 120,000horses were treated for wounds or disease by British <b>veterinary</b> hospitals alone. Ambulances and field <b>veterinary</b> hospitals were required to care for the horses, and horse trailers were first developed for use on the Western Front as equine ambulances. Disease was also a major issue for horses at the front, with equine influenza, ringworm, sand colic, sores from fly bites, and anthrax among the illnesses that affected them. British Army Army <b>Veterinary</b> Corps hospitals treated 725,216 horses over the course of the war, successfully healing 529,064. Horses were moved from the front to <b>veterinary</b> hospitals by several methods of transportation, including on foot, by rail and by barge. During the last months of the war, barges were considered ideal transportation for horses suffering wounds from shells and bombs.|$|E

25|$|Aspiring veterinarians {{can earn}} {{several types of}} degrees, differing by country and {{involving}} undergraduate or graduate education. In the United States, schools award the Doctor of <b>Veterinary</b> Medicine degree (DVM). This degree is also awarded in Bangladesh, Canada, Ethiopia, Hungary, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, Tobago and Trinidad. Other countries offer a degree equivalent to the North American DVM. In the United Kingdom and countries which have adopted the undergraduate system of higher education, a bachelor's degree is equivalent to a DVM (after {{five or six years}} of study). In the US, a four-year DVM degree such as Bachelor of <b>Veterinary</b> Science, Bachelor of <b>Veterinary</b> Medicine or Bachelor of <b>Veterinary</b> Medicine and Surgery follows a four-year undergraduate degree (eight years of study after high school). In Ireland, the <b>Veterinary</b> Medicine Programme at the University College Dublin awards the Bachelor of <b>Veterinary</b> Medicine (MVB). At the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow, the degree awarded is the Bachelor of <b>Veterinary</b> Medicine & Surgery (BVMS). Some <b>veterinary</b> schools offer a degree enabling the recipient to practice <b>veterinary</b> medicine in their home country but does not permit the individual to take a licensing examination abroad; for example, <b>veterinary</b> schools in Afghanistan offer only the Bachelor of Science (BS) degree. Although Ethiopia awards a Doctor of <b>Veterinary</b> Medicine degree, it is not recognized in the US or Western Europe.|$|E
