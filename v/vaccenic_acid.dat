40|$|The {{effect of}} {{environmental}} ethanol concentration on the fatty acid composition of strains of Lactobacillus hilgardii, differing in their tolerance to ethanol, was determined. A marked {{increase in the}} proportion of lactobacillic acid (a cyclopropane fatty acid) and a decrease in oleic and <b>vaccenic</b> <b>acids</b> with increasing ethanol concentration was observed. The amount of lactobacillic acid determined at standard conditions (25 °C, 0 % ethanol) was found to be proportional to the ethanol tolerance of the strains studied. The effect of this alcohol on plasma membrane fluidity was studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The adaptive response to growth in the presence of high concentrations of ethanol produced membranes which, within the limits of ethanol tolerance, maintained the fluidity and integrity in an environment which tends to increase membrane rigidity. When pre-adapted cells are analysed in the absence of environmental ethanol there is a measurabie increase in fluidity. It is proposed that this phenomenon may be correlated with the increase {{in the proportion of}} lactobacillic acid. The existence of a relationship between membrane fluidity and ethanol tolerance is discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the fatty acid profile and morphometric {{characteristics}} of fat globules in Amiata donkey milk {{in relation to}} the lactation phase and production season have been evalutated. Individual donkey milk samplings were carried out monthly starting from day 30 of lactation until day 300. The amount of fat and the diameter of the milk fat globules were fairly stable during lactation, whereas the number of globules/mL of milk decreased significantly only in the last phase of lactation. The fatty acid composition showed only a few changes during lactation, which consisted in a progressive decrease in the short chain fatty acids and an increasing trend in the monounsaturated fatty acids. Winter milk showed a significantly larger average diameter, a lower number of fat globules/mL, lower (P < 0. 01) percentages of short-chain saturated fatty acids and more (P < 0. 01) long-chain and monounsaturated fatty acids. In addition, significantly lower percentages of C 18 : 0 and higher of palmitoleic, oleic and <b>vaccenic</b> <b>acids</b> were detected in the cooler season.

40|$|Background:The role of {{individual}} fatty acids {{in the development}} and progression of breast cancer is unclear. Although in vitro and animal experiments have supported an inverse association between intake of long chain n- 3 fatty acids [primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid] and breast cancer risk, findings from population studies are inconsistent. Recent studies have also shown associations between the ratio of saturated to monounsaturated fatty acids (SI) and breast cancer risk. The SI reflects the activity of several genes involved in lipid metabolism, including fatty acid synthase and steroyl coenzyme-A desaturase, that {{have been shown to be}} overexpressed in breast cancer. Objective:The purpose of this analysis was to determine the association between erythrocyte fatty acid concentrations and breast cancer risk among women participating in a randomized trial of breast self-examination in Shanghai, China. Design:We conducted a case-control study. Erythrocyte fatty acid concentrations were determined in specimens from 322 women with histologically confirmed breast cancer and 1030 frequency age-matched control women. Results:We report a significant direct association among palmitic, -linolenic, palmitoleic, and <b>vaccenic</b> <b>acids</b> and risk of breast cancer. Total n- 3 fatty acids, EPA, and the SI for palmitic to palmitoleic acid were associated with significantly lower risk of breast cancer.

40|$|Background : It {{has been}} argued that a {{reduction}} in the Western diet of anti-inflammatory unsaturated lipids, such as n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, has contributed to the increase in the frequency and severity of allergic diseases. Objective : We investigated whether feeding milk fat enriched in conjugated linoleic <b>acid</b> and <b>vaccenic</b> <b>acids</b> (VAs) (2 ̆ 7 enriched 2 ̆ 7 milk fat), produced by supplementing the diet of pasture-fed cows with fish and sunflower oil, will prevent development of allergic airway responses. Methods : C 57 BL/ 6 mice were fed a control diet containing soybean oil and diets supplemented with milk lipids. They were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (OVA) on days 14 and 28, and challenged intranasally with OVA on day 42. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung tissues and serum samples were collected 6 days after the intranasal challenge. Results : Feeding of enriched milk fat led to marked suppression of airway inflammation as evidenced by reductions in eosinophilia and lymphocytosis in the airways, compared with feeding of normal milk fat and control diet. Enriched milk fat significantly reduced circulating allergen-specific IgE and IgG 1 levels, together with reductions in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of IL- 5 and CCL 11. Treatment significantly inhibited changes in the airway including airway epithelial cell hypertrophy, goblet cell metaplasia and mucus hypersecretion. The two major components of enriched milk fat, cis- 9, trans- 11 conjugated linoleic acid and VA, inhibited airway inflammation when fed together to mice, whereas alone they were not effective. Conclusion : Milk fat enriched in conjugated linoleic and VAs suppresses inflammation and changes to the airways in an animal model of allergic airway disease. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Four diets, {{supplemented}} with different fats of vegetable origin, were compared in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with eight primiparous Italian Friesian cows (two cows per cell). The four fats were: toasted full fat soy bean in diet WS; toasted full fat linseed in diet WL; calcium soap of palm oil in diet PS; and calcium soap {{of olive oil}} in diet OS. Scope of the trial was to study {{the effect of the}} four different fat sources on milk yield and composition and on the quality of milk fat in terms of safety for the consumer health, with particular attention to trans fatty acids and to conjugated linoleic acid isomers (CLA). Diet OS induced the highest milk yield (P< 0. 05), while diet PS gave the fattest milk (P< 0. 05), and the highest milk content of both saturated and medium chain fatty acids (P< 0. 05). Saturated to unsaturated ratio of milk fat was decreased when cows were fed diet WS (P< 0. 05), while the ratio was increased with cows fed on diet PS (P< 0. 05). With a closely similar behaviour milk CLA content was enhanced with diet WS and strongly depressed (P< 0. 05) with diet PS. Diet OS increased total CLA as well, probably {{as a consequence of the}} bio-hydrogenation process of large amounts of oleic acid, transformed into trans isomers of C 18 : 1, including <b>vaccenic</b> <b>acids.</b> Full fat soy bean promoted some milk fatty acids with beneficial effects on consumer health, but calcium soap of olive oil similarly improved the fatty acid profile of milk fat, while meeting the cows’ requirements as an energy supplement...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years the {{interest}} of scientists in the nutritional value of milk and dairy products has been increasing {{as a result of the}} role of specific components such as individual fatty acids (FAs) in health maintenance and chronic diseases. Milk fatty acid composition has been reported to change with the morphometric characteristics of milk fat globules. Although some studies have investigated the relationship between milk fatty acids and the morphometric characteristics of milk fat globules in cows, this relationship has not been sufficiently explored in ewe's milk. The aim of this study was to check how the nutritional value of fatty acid profile in ewe's milk is linked to changes in the morphometric characteristics of milk fat globules (MFGs). The study involved sampling and analyzing bulk milk from a dairy that collects and manufactures milk from six flocks of Massese ewes. All the ewes were reared in the same area of Tuscany (Italy) and were fed according to a grazing system. Milk samples were taken over a month. Results highlighted a negative correlation between the number of milk fat globules/mL and the average diameter of the MFGs. In addition, the number of MFGs was positively related with n- 3 docosapentaenoic acid, long chain FAs, monounsaturated FAs, and the n- 3 /n- 6 ratio. It was negatively related on the other hand, with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), n- 6 FAs, thrombogenic index and the linoleic/linolenic acid ratio. MFGs > 5 μm were positively related with lauric and <b>vaccenic</b> <b>acids,</b> with short chain FAs, PUFAs, n- 6 FAs, and the linoleic/linolenic ratio; whereas MFGs < 2 μm were negatively related with PUFAs, n- 6 and the linoleic/linolenic ratio.

The major sources of dietary trans MUFA (dairy fat vs. industrially hydrogenated oils) have different isomeric profiles and thus probably different metabolic consequences. These effects may involve alterations in muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity, which may in turn promote insulin resistance if fatty acid oxidation is reduced. We report that in Wistar rats, an 8 week diet enriched (4 % of energy intake) in either dairy, industrial, or control MUFA did not alter insulin and glucose responses to an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (1 g/kg). In C 2 C 12 myotubes, <b>vaccenic</b> and elaidic <b>acids</b> did not modify insulin sensitivity compared with oleic acid. Furthermore, the ex vivo total, mitochondrial and peroxisomal oxidation rates of [1 -(14) C]oleic, <b>vaccenic,</b> and elaidic <b>acids</b> were similar in soleus and tibialis anterior rat muscle. Finally, an 8 week diet enriched in either dairy or industrial trans MUFA did not alter mitochondrial oxidative capacity in these two muscles compared with control MUFA but did induce a specific reduction in soleus mitochondrial ATP and superoxide anion production (P< 0. 01 vs. control). In conclusion, dietary trans MUFA of dairy or industrial origin have similar effects and do not impair muscle mitochondrial capacity and insulin sensitivity...|$|R

The basal diet {{was composed of}} alfalfa and meadow hay during pregnancy and alfalfa hay during lactation. At slaughter, carcass and meat quality were evaluated. Sensory quality of Semimembranosus from 0 % and 20 % EL lambs was assessed. Both maternal and postweaning diets affected growth performance, with higher body weights recorded with the 10 % EL concentrate. Carcass and meat quality were not affected by diet. Saturated and monounsaturated FA decreased and n- 3 polyunsaturated FA increased with increasing EL content in lamb diet. An increase in <b>vaccenic</b> and rumenic <b>acid</b> {{was associated with the}} EL content of the maternal diet. Both diets increased the n- 6 /n- 3 FA ratio. No differences in acceptability were detected by consumers among groups. It is concluded that EL supplementation and early life nutrition can influence performance and FA metabolism in growing lambs...|$|R
