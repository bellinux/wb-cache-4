5|$|Crime rates {{vary widely}} by area, ranging from parts with serious issues to parts {{considered}} <b>very</b> <b>safe.</b> Today crime figures are made available nationally at Local Authority and Ward level. In 2015 there were 118 homicides, a 25.5% increase over 2014. The Metropolitan Police have made detailed crime figures, {{broken down by}} category at borough and ward level, available on their website since 2000.|$|E
5|$|From Thirlspot two routes lead up Helvellyn. The old pony route took a <b>very</b> <b>safe</b> {{and steady}} route {{for the benefit}} of early visitors, who took horses and a guide from the inn. The route {{traverses}} the flank of White Side to join the ridge at the col just below Lower Man. The other route, known as the White Stones Route, originally marked by stones painted white, crosses the fellside at a lower level and fords Helvellyn Gill to join the path from Swirls.|$|E
5|$|The inactivated polio {{vaccines}} are <b>very</b> <b>safe.</b> Mild redness or pain {{may occur}} {{at the site of}} injection. Oral polio vaccines cause about three cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis per million doses given. This compares with one in two hundred who are paralysed following a polio infection. Both are generally safe to give during pregnancy and in those who have HIV/AIDS but are otherwise well.|$|E

6000|$|... “There is no <b>very</b> good <b>safe</b> deposit {{place in}} Crumville. Besides, I {{must have the}} gems here, if my workmen are to set them properly. Of course, I’ll {{keep them in the}} old safes when they are not in the workshop.” ...|$|R
5|$|Azelaic acid {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a 20% concentration. Treatment twice daily for six months is necessary, and is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide5%, isotretinoin0.05%, and erythromycin2%. Azelaic acid is thought to be an effective acne treatment due to its ability to reduce skin cell accumulation in the follicle, and its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It has a slight skin-lightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis, and is therefore useful in treating of individuals with acne who are also affected by postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Azelaic acid may cause skin irritation but is otherwise <b>very</b> <b>safe.</b> It is less effective and more expensive than retinoids.|$|E
5|$|Arguments rumbled on {{and there}} were endless delays. Early {{versions}} of the sticky bomb were prone to leaks as well as breakage in transport. There were understandable concerns over the explosive charge: pure nitroglycerin is notoriously susceptible to the slightest knock, but the mixture developed by ICI proved to be <b>very</b> <b>safe</b> even if it should get into the hinges of the storage boxes. By December 1940, fewer than 66,000 had been produced {{and the rate of}} production was disappointing at five to ten thousand per week. Further, it was suggested that the original order of one million be reduced to 200,000. Minor improvements to the design were made, of which the most significant was to replace the glass flask with plastic. Finally, after passing all the required tests, the sticky bomb – now the No 74 Grenade Mk II – was accepted by the Ordnance Board; it was put into full-scale production and it became a service issue.|$|E

50|$|Note: Due to {{the highly}} {{variable}} amount of coumarin in C. cassia, usually well over 1,000 mg of coumarin per kg of cinnamon and sometimes up to 12 times that, C. cassia has a <b>very</b> low <b>safe</b> intake level {{to adhere to}} the above TDI.|$|R
25|$|These use fuel molded into ceramic balls, {{and then}} {{circulate}} gas through the balls. The {{result is an}} efficient, low-maintenance, <b>very</b> <b>safe</b> reactor with inexpensive, standardized fuel. The prototype was the AVR.|$|E
25|$|HPV {{vaccines}} are <b>very</b> <b>safe.</b> Pain at {{the site}} of injection occurs in about 80% of people. Redness and swelling {{at the site}} and fever may also occur. No link to Guillain–Barré syndrome has been found.|$|E
25|$|The lower Russian River is {{a popular}} spring, summer, and fall {{destination}} for navigation and recreation. It is <b>very</b> <b>safe</b> at that time for swimming and boating, with a gentle current. The river is dangerous in the winter, with swift current and muddy water.|$|E
60|$|When Peter's {{stomach was}} stuffed full {{he gave a}} great sigh of relief and limped back to the {{friendly}} old bramble-bush to rest. But he couldn't sit still long, for {{he just had to}} find out all about the Old Pasture. So pretty soon he started out to explore. Such a wonderful place as it seemed to Peter! There were clumps of bushes with little open spaces between, just the nicest kind of playgrounds. Then there were funny spreading, prickly juniper-trees, which made the <b>very</b> <b>safest</b> places to crawl out of harm's way and to hide. Everywhere were paths made by cows. Very wonderful they seemed to Peter, who had never seen any like them before. He liked to follow them because they led to all kinds of queer places.|$|R
25|$|Once the non-latch-up {{capability}} {{was achieved}} in IGBTs, {{it was found}} that IGBTs exhibited very rugged and a <b>very</b> large <b>safe</b> operating area. It was demonstrated that the product of the operating current density and the collector voltage exceeded the theoretical limit of bipolar transistors, 2 W/cm2, and reached 5 W/cm2.|$|R

25|$|President George W. Bush {{also made}} an {{appearance}} in the district {{two days before the}} election to campaign for Smith—a sign that the national party was very concerned about its chances in what had long been presumed to be a <b>very</b> <b>safe</b> Republican seat.|$|E
25|$|Correspondingly, the 1st Congressional District shed {{conservative}} St. Bernard Parish {{and other}} areas south of the lake to the 3rd Congressional District from 1984 through 2013. Overall, the 1st Congressional District has become a <b>very</b> <b>safe</b> district for the Republican Party. Before the 1960s, it was controlled by Democrats, but conservative whites realigned with the Republican Party.|$|E
25|$|In {{the months}} before the 1999 state election, Caroline Hogg, the sitting member for the <b>very</b> <b>safe</b> Labor Legislative Council seat of Melbourne North Province, {{announced}} that she would resign only halfway through her term. This meant that a by-election for her seat would be held alongside the regular election, and Broad won Labor pre-selection to fill the vacancy.|$|E
50|$|Central Asians {{are still}} in demand as {{livestock}} guardians, though {{not nearly as much}} as they used to be. These dogs, to differing degrees, are protective against human intruders; they are <b>very</b> territorial, <b>safe</b> with children; they love and respect elderly people, protect all small animals from predators, and are very gentle with family members.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A {{hundred and}} fifty odd pound,' resumed Mr. Bounderby. 'That sum of money, young Tom locked in his <b>safe,</b> not a <b>very</b> strong <b>safe,</b> but that's no matter now.

5000|$|These {{findings}} also {{went on to}} suggest that Chemplast Sanmar had been responsible, alongside the State and the Chemplast workers Unions, for [...] "downplaying serious incidents" [...] and followed this up by suggesting that the Government had been [...] "neglient in fulfilling its duties of ensuring, at the <b>very</b> least, <b>safe</b> drinking water to the people." ...|$|R
25|$|The commercially more {{important}} production route uses methanol as the reducing agent and sulfuric acid for the acidity. Two advantages of {{not using the}} chloride-based processes are {{that there is no}} formation of elemental chlorine, and that sodium sulfate, a valuable chemical for the pulp mill, is a side-product. These methanol-based processes provide high efficiency and can be made <b>very</b> <b>safe.</b>|$|E
25|$|An allergy {{blood test}} is {{available}} through most laboratories. A sample of the patient's blood is sent to a laboratory for analysis, {{and the results are}} sent back a few days later. Multiple allergens can be detected with a single blood sample. Allergy blood tests are <b>very</b> <b>safe,</b> since the person is not exposed to any allergens during the testing procedure.|$|E
25|$|Many Prague Metro {{stations}} are quite large, with several entrances spaced relatively far apart. This can {{often lead to}} confusion for those unfamiliar with the system, especially at the central hubs such as Můstek or Muzeum. In general the {{stations are}} well signposted even for those unfamiliar with the Czech language. In the centre is planned introduction of multilingual signs. The Prague metro is <b>very</b> <b>safe.</b>|$|E
60|$|Peter Rabbit {{sat in the}} {{old stone}} wall along one side of Farmer Brown's orchard, waiting for Mrs. Moon to put out her light and leave the world in {{darkness}} until jolly, round, red Mr. Sun should kick off his rosy bedclothes and begin his daily climb up in the blue, blue sky. In the winter, Mr. Sun is a late sleeper, and Peter knew {{that there would be}} two or three hours after Mrs. Moon put out her light when it would be quite dark. And Peter also knew too that by this time Hooty the Owl would probably have caught his dinner. So would old Granny Fox and Reddy Fox. Bowser the Hound would be too sleepy to be on the watch. It would be the <b>very</b> <b>safest</b> time for Peter to try to get to his home in the dear Old Briar-patch.|$|R

25|$|Footscray {{falls within}} the federal {{electorate}} of Gellibrand (currently held by Tim Watts from the ALP) and the state electorate of Footscray (currently held by the ALP's Marsha Thomson), and the City of Maribyrnong at local level (currently controlled by four independents). The suburb's historical voting patterns have been fairly typical of a working-class suburb with a high migrant population. Footscray is a <b>very</b> <b>safe</b> state ALP seat, 65% of the vote went to Labor at the 2014 State election.|$|E
25|$|Carprofen, {{and other}} anti-inflammatories in general, whilst <b>very</b> <b>safe</b> for most animals, can {{sometimes}} cause problems for some animals, and (in a few rare cases) sudden death through liver toxicity. This is most commonly discussed with carprofen {{but may be}} equally relevant with other anti-inflammatories. As a result, it is often recommended to perform monthly (or at least, twice-annually) blood tests {{to confirm that the}} animal is not reacting adversely to the medications. Such side effects are rare but worth being aware of, especially if long-term use is anticipated.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1990s, {{fentanyl}} {{was introduced}} for palliative {{use with the}} fentanyl patch, followed {{in the next decade}} by the introduction of the fentanyl lollipop, dissolving tablets, and sublingual spray which are absorbed through the tissues inside the mouth. , fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in medicine. In 2013, 1,700 kilograms (3,750 lbs) were used globally. Fentanyl has a relatively wide therapeutic index (270) which makes it a <b>very</b> <b>safe</b> surgical anaesthetic when monitored carefully; however, its potency requires careful measurements of highly diluted fentanyl in solution.|$|E
6000|$|... [NOTE.--I have {{received}} several letters (two from educated and ostensibly intelligent persons), which contained, in substance, this protest: [...] "I don't object {{to men and}} women chancing their lives with these people, but it is a burning shame that the law should allow them to trust their helpless little children in their deadly hands." [...] Isn't it touching? Isn't it deep? Isn't it modest? It is as if the person said: [...] "I know that to a parent his child is the core of his heart, the apple of his eye, a possession so dear, so precious that he will trust its life in no hands but those which he believes, with all his soul, to be the very best and the <b>very</b> <b>safest,</b> but it is a burning shame that the law does not require him to come to me to ask what kind of healer I will allow him to call."
