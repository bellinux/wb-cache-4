5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two <b>vortices</b> may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two <b>vortices</b> are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E
5|$|Although this is {{a widely}} {{accepted}} theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple <b>vortices.</b> These each have different mechanisms which influence their development—however, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, a cyclone is a {{large scale}} air mass that rotates around a strong center of low {{atmospheric}} pressure. Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar <b>vortices</b> and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the synoptic scale). Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale.|$|E
5|$|Vortex {{streets are}} zigzagging {{patterns}} of whirling <b>vortices</b> {{created by the}} unsteady separation of flow of a fluid, most often air or water, over obstructing objects. Smooth (laminar) flow starts to break up when {{the size of the}} obstruction or the velocity of the flow become large enough compared to the viscosity of the fluid.|$|E
5|$|As in {{many other}} insects, the lift {{generated}} by butterflies is more than can {{be accounted for by}} steady-state, non-transitory aerodynamics. Studies using Vanessa atalanta in a wind tunnel show that they use a wide variety of aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force. These include wake capture, <b>vortices</b> at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the Weis-Fogh 'clap-and-fling' mechanism. Butterflies are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Thrips (order Thysanoptera) are minute (most are 1mm long or less), slender insects with fringed {{wings and}} unique {{asymmetrical}} mouthparts. Different thrips species feed mostly on plants by puncturing and sucking up the contents, {{although a few}} are predators. Approximately 6,000 species have been described. They fly only weakly and their feathery wings are unsuitable for conventional flight; instead, thrips exploit an unusual mechanism, clap and fling, to create lift using an unsteady circulation pattern with transient <b>vortices</b> near the wings.|$|E
5|$|When a {{wave train}} strikes a wall at an oblique angle, the {{reflected}} wave train departs at the supplementary angle causing a cross-hatched wave interference pattern {{known as the}} clapotis gaufré ("waffled clapotis"). In this situation, the individual crests formed {{at the intersection of}} the incident and reflected wave train crests move parallel to the structure. This wave motion, when combined with the resultant <b>vortices,</b> can erode material from the seabed and transport it along the wall, undermining the structure until it fails.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Airbus tested three {{styles of}} winglet {{intended}} {{to counteract the}} wing's induced drag and wingtip <b>vortices</b> more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. The first design type to be tested was developed by Airbus and was based on work done by the AWIATOR programme. The second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by Winglet Technology, a company based in Wichita, Kansas. Two aircraft {{were used in the}} flight test evaluation campaign– the prototype A320, which had been retained by Airbus for testing, and a new build aircraft which was fitted with both types of winglets before it was delivered to JetBlue.|$|E
5|$|It {{is true that}} a {{house that}} is between two {{destroyed}} homes can be undamaged, {{but this is not}} the result of a tornado skipping, as some previously thought. After the 1974 Super Outbreak, Dr. Ted Fujita studied many films of tornadoes from that day. Included in his review was damage and tornado film footage of F4 and F5 tornadoes. Fujita concluded that multiple <b>vortices,</b> highly volatile tornadic satellites transiting within a parent tornado at high speeds, are responsible for making tornadoes appear to skip houses. The phenomenon of satellite tornadoes, where a smaller tornado orbits a larger companion tornado, can also lead to gaps in damage between the two tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} environmental noise. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by <b>vortices</b> created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these spanwise <b>vortices</b> shed behind the flap, chordwise <b>vortices</b> shed from {{in front of the}} flap become important at high angles of attack.|$|E
25|$|Whistling {{telephone}} wires, automobile radio antennae, certain automobile front grilles, {{and smoke}} stacks are {{other examples of}} this tone. At very low Reynolds numbers, the flow around a cylinder is stable, forming two fixed <b>vortices</b> behind it. As the speed increases, the flow, although laminar, becomes unstable and <b>vortices</b> are shed alternately.|$|E
25|$|Observations of the Red Spot Jr. storm suggest Jupiter {{could be}} in a period of global climate change. This is {{hypothesized}} to be part of an approximately 70 year global climate cycle, characterized by the relatively rapid forming and subsequent slow erosion and merging of cyclonic and anticyclonic <b>vortices</b> in Jupiter's atmosphere. These <b>vortices</b> facilitate the heat exchange between poles and equator. If they have sufficiently eroded, heat exchange is strongly reduced and regional temperatures may shift by as much as 10 K, with the poles cooling down and the equator region heating up. The resulting large temperature differential destabilizes the atmosphere and thereby leads to the creation of new <b>vortices.</b>|$|E
25|$|Less of Book 2 {{has stood}} the test of time than of Books 1 and 3, and it has been said that Book 2 was largely written on purpose to refute a theory of Descartes which had some wide {{acceptance}} before Newton's work (and for some time after). According to this Cartesian theory of <b>vortices,</b> planetary motions were produced by the whirling of fluid <b>vortices</b> that filled interplanetary space and carried the planets along with them. Newton wrote at the end of Book 2 his conclusion that the hypothesis of <b>vortices</b> was completely at odds with the astronomical phenomena, and served not so much to explain as to confuse them.|$|E
25|$|René Descartes (1644) and Christiaan Huygens (1690) used <b>vortices</b> {{to explain}} gravitation.|$|E
25|$|When a {{rectangular}} jet impinges on a sharp edged object {{such as a}} wedge, a feedback loop can be established resulting in a nearly pure tone. The figure on the right shows schematically the circulation of two <b>vortices</b> as they pass the wedge. This simple diagram {{suggests that there is}} a force applied to the wedge whose angle varies as the <b>vortices</b> pass.|$|E
25|$|Vortilon is a {{contraction}} of VORTex and pYLON words (generating <b>vortices</b> as a leading-edge engine pylon does).|$|E
25|$|The disc wing design {{featured}} a low aspect ratio that overcame the built-in disadvantages of induced drag created at the wingtips {{with the large}} propellers actively cancelling the drag-causing tip <b>vortices.</b> The propellers were arranged to rotate {{in the opposite direction}} to the tip <b>vortices,</b> allowing the aircraft to fly with a much smaller wing area. The small wing provided high maneuverability with greater structural strength.|$|E
25|$|Normally, a wing {{with such}} a low aspect ratio will suffer from very poor {{performance}} due {{to the degree of}} induced drag created at the wingtips, as the higher pressure air below spills around the wingtip to the lower-pressure region above. In a conventional aircraft, these wingtip <b>vortices</b> carry a lot of energy with them and hence create drag. The usual approach to reducing these <b>vortices</b> is to build a wing with a high aspect ratio, i.e. one that is long and narrow. However, such wings compromise the maneuverability and roll rate of the aircraft, or present a structural challenge in building them stiff enough. The XF5U attempted to overcome the tip vortex problem using the propellers to actively cancel the drag-causing tip <b>vortices.</b> The propellers are arranged to rotate in the opposite direction to the tip <b>vortices,</b> with the aim of retaining the higher-pressure air below the wing. With this source of drag eliminated, the aircraft would fly with a much smaller wing area, and the small wing would yield high maneuverability with greater structural strength.|$|E
25|$|The {{cavitation}} phenomenon {{can also}} be described using fluid mechanics. This can result from pressure oscillations, flow deceleration, tip <b>vortices,</b> streamline contraction, and squeeze jets. This last cause is the most contributive factor to cavitation. The squeeze jets are formed when the valve is closing and the blood between the occluder and valve housing is “squeezed” out to create a high-speed jet. This in turn creates intense <b>vortices</b> with very low pressures {{that can lead to}} cavitation.|$|E
25|$|The war is {{the subject}} of Nabil Kanso’s {{paintings}} The <b>Vortices</b> of Wrath (Lebanon 1977), Lebanon (painting), Endless Night (painting), Lebanon Summer 1982.|$|E
25|$|High-speed {{turbulence}} and <b>vortices</b> can {{be difficult}} to see directly, but strobe lights and film cameras or high-speed digital cameras can help to capture events that are a blur to the naked eye.|$|E
25|$|The Gurney flap {{increases}} lift {{by altering}} the Kutta condition at the trailing edge. The wake behind the flap {{is a pair}} of counter-rotating <b>vortices</b> that are alternately shed in a von Kármán vortex street.|$|E
25|$|The {{bracketed}} term includes two feedback loop speeds; the downstream speed is {{the speed of}} the <b>vortices</b> u and the upstream speed is that of sound c0. The various modes are described by an integer n with an empirical delay constant β (near 0.25). The integer n is closely related to the number of <b>vortices</b> en route to the edge. It is clear from shadowgraphs that the fluctuating force near the downstream edge is the sound source. Since the Mach number of the flow can be appreciable, refraction makes it difficult to determine the major axis of the dipole-like sound field. The preferred frequencies in shallow cavities are different from those for the edge tone.|$|E
25|$|In these whistles, {{the flow}} {{instability}} is asymmetric, often resulting in rows of alternate <b>vortices</b> {{and the sound}} generation is associated with fluctuations of applied force. The sound field {{is as close to}} a dipole source as local geometry allows.|$|E
25|$|In these whistles, {{the flow}} {{instability}} is symmetric, often resulting in periodic ring <b>vortices</b> {{and the sound}} generation is associated with fluctuations of volumetric (mass) flow rates. The sound field {{is as close to}} the directivity of an actual monopole source as local geometry allows.|$|E
25|$|There {{does not}} appear to be any {{detailed}} research on police whistle operation. Considering the edge tone, noted above, one might expect several jumps in frequency, but none occur. This suggests that if multiple <b>vortices</b> exist in the unstable jet, they do not control.|$|E
25|$|Higher stages are {{associated}} with more <b>vortices</b> in that distance, hinting that this distance {{can be an important}} characteristic dimension. In several whistles, three stages have been identified (edge tone). By blowing hard in some musical wind instruments Stage I jumps to Stage II; it is called overblowing.|$|E
25|$|High-speed {{cameras are}} also {{required}} {{when the subject}} of the test is itself moving at high speed, such as an airplane propeller. The camera can capture stop-motion images of how the blade cuts through the particulate streams and how <b>vortices</b> are generated along the trailing edges of the moving blade.|$|E
25|$|Closely {{related to}} the {{creation}} of <b>vortices</b> in BECs is the generation of so-called dark solitons in one-dimensional BECs. These topological objects feature a phase gradient across their nodal plane, which stabilizes their shape even in propagation and interaction. Although solitons carry no charge and are thus prone to decay, relatively long-lived dark solitons have been produced and studied extensively.|$|E
25|$|Vortilons {{are often}} used to improve {{low-speed}} aileron performance, thereby increasing resistance to spin. They {{can be used as}} an alternative to wing fences, which also restrict airflow along the span of the wing. Vortilons only stream <b>vortices</b> at high angles of attack and produce less drag at higher speeds than wing fences. Pylons used to mount jet engines under the wing produce a similar effect.|$|E
25|$|The Matterhorn is an {{isolated}} mountain. Because of {{its position on}} the main Alpine watershed and its great height, the Matterhorn is exposed to rapid weather changes. In addition, the steep faces of the mountain and its isolated location make it prone to banner clouds formation, with the air flowing around the mountain producing condensation of the air on the lee side and also creating <b>vortices.</b>|$|E
25|$|Current {{detection}} is a {{detection system}} of water currents, consisting mostly of <b>vortices,</b> {{found in the}} lateral line of fish and aquatic forms of amphibians. The lateral line is also sensitive to low-frequency vibrations. The mechanoreceptors are hair cells, the same mechanoreceptors for vestibular sense and hearing. It is used primarily for navigation, hunting, and schooling. The receptors of the electrical sense are modified hair cells of the lateral line system.|$|E
25|$|Raked wingtips, {{similar to}} the ones used on the 777-200LR, 777-300ER, and 787 aircraft, are used on the new 747 variant instead of {{winglets}} used on the 747-400. These wingtip structures help reduce the wingtip <b>vortices</b> at the lateral edges of the wings, decreasing wake turbulence and drag, and thereby improving fuel efficiency. Another effort to reduce weight is the introduction of fly-by-wire technology {{for the majority of the}} lateral controls.|$|E
25|$|During flight testing, the snag on {{the leading}} edge of the stabilators was filled in, and the gap between the leading-edge {{extensions}} (LEX) and the fuselage mostly filled in. The gaps, called the boundary layer air discharge (BLAD) slots, controlled the <b>vortices</b> generated by the LEX and presented clean air to the vertical stabilizers at high angles of attack, but they also generated a great deal of parasitic drag, worsening the problem of the F/A-18's inadequate range. McDonnell filled in 80% of the gap, leaving a small slot to bleed air from the engine intake. This may have contributed to early problems with fatigue cracks appearing on the vertical stabilizers due to extreme Structural loads, resulting in a short grounding in 1984 until the stabilizers were strengthened. Starting in May 1988, a small vertical fence was added to the top of each LEX to broaden the <b>vortices</b> and direct them away from the vertical stabilizers. This also provided a minor increase in controllability as a side effect. F/A-18s of early versions had a problem with insufficient rate of roll, exacerbated by the insufficient wing stiffness, especially with heavy underwing ordnance loads.|$|E
25|$|A {{superconductor}} can be TypeI, {{meaning it}} has a single critical field, above which all superconductivity is lost and below which the magnetic field is completely expelled from the superconductor; or TypeII, meaning it has two critical fields, between which it allows partial penetration of the magnetic field through isolated points. These points are called <b>vortices.</b> Furthermore, in multicomponent superconductors {{it is possible to}} have combination of the two behaviours. In that case the superconductor is of Type-1.5.|$|E
