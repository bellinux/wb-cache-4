5|$|Agriculture was {{independently}} {{developed on}} the island of New Guinea. In Greece from c. 11,000 BC lentils, <b>vetch,</b> pistachios, and almonds were cultivated, while wild oats and wild barley appear in quantity from c. 7,000 BC alongside einkorn wheat, barley, sheep, goats and pigs, while emmer was used on Cyprus between 9,100 and 8,600 BC.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers aim for a {{moisture}} content of 50-to-52 percent and a fat-in-dry-matter content of 35-to-40 percent. A {{study published in}} the International Journal of Food & Science Technology found that a 12.5:87.5 blend of <b>vetch</b> milk and bovine milk improved stretchiness and melting characteristics. <b>Vetch</b> is a legume that has seeds which are similar to lentils. An experiment published in the International Journal of Dairy Technology suggested that the level of galactose, a monosaccharide sugar that is less sweet than glucose and fructose, can be reduced using different culture techniques. An article in the International Journal of Food Engineering found that trisodium citrate, a food additive used to preserve and add flavor to foods, slightly improved the preferred qualities of pizza cheese. Research published in Dairy Industries International suggested that denatured whey proteins increased moisture retention, but that the improvements were very slight and not economically worthwhile relative to the minor improvements.|$|E

5|$|Brean Down is a {{site for}} the nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum apenninum), which occurs in {{abundance}} on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing near Bridgwater Bay, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae) Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild thyme, horseshoe <b>vetch</b> and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} after 9,500 BC that the eight {{so-called}} founder crops of agriculture appear: first emmer and einkorn wheat, then hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter <b>vetch,</b> chick peas and flax. These eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) sites in the Levant, although wheat {{was the first to}} be grown and harvested on a significant scale. At around the same time (9400 BC), parthenocarpic fig trees were domesticated.|$|E
5|$|The {{headland}} {{is primarily}} covered with grass, {{as well as}} heather (Calluna vulgaris), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), thyme (Thymus polytrichus) and western gorse (Ulex gallii). In 1962, specimens of the comparatively rare western clover (Trifolium occidentale) were found on Zennor Head. The lichen Dirina massiliensis has also been found high on the acid schist cliffs on the north-, seaward-side of the headland. The parasitic plant dodder (Cuscuta epithymum) is found growing on gorse. There are also typical coastal flowering plants such as kidney <b>vetch</b> (Anthyllis vulneraria), sea campion (Silene uniflora), and thrift (Armeria maritima).|$|E

5000|$|Vicia is a genus {{of about}} 140 species of {{flowering}} {{plants that are}} part of the legume family (Fabaceae), and which are commonly known as <b>vetches.</b> Member species are native to Europe, North America, South America, Asia and Africa. Some other genera of their subfamily Faboideae also have names containing [...] "vetch", for example the vetchlings (Lathyrus) or the milk-vetches (Astragalus). The broad bean (Vicia faba) is sometimes separated in a monotypic genus Faba; although not often used today, it is of historical importance in plant taxonomy as the namesake of the order Fabales, the Fabaceae and the Faboideae. The tribe Vicieae in which the <b>vetches</b> are placed is named after the genus' current name. Among the closest living relatives of <b>vetches</b> are the lentils (Lens) and the true peas (Pisum).|$|R
5|$|At the school, Ged's skills inspire admiration {{among the}} {{teachers}} {{as well as}} students. He befriends an older student named <b>Vetch,</b> but generally remains aloof from his fellows. Another student, Jasper, acts condescendingly towards Ged and provokes the latter's proud nature. After Jasper needles Ged during a feast, Ged challenges him to a duel. He casts a powerful spell intended to raise {{the spirit of a}} dead woman, but the spell goes awry and releases a shadow creature, which attacks Ged and scars his face. The Archmage Nemmerle banishes the shadow and saves Ged's life, although it costs Nemmerle his own.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the geological interest of the site, the range of plants growing on Brean Down has led to it being designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum appenninum) is a common species at the site, occurring in abundance on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing here, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae). Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild thyme, horseshoe <b>vetch</b> and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.|$|E
5|$|The site of {{the fort}} and warren is now grassy slopes which attract {{a wide range of}} wild flowers and butterflies. The differing soil types provide {{suitable}} habitats for both acid- and lime-loving plants. Kidney <b>vetch</b> (Anthyllis vulneraria), harebell (Campanula rotundifolia) and woolly thistle (Cirsium eriophorum) thrive on the dry stony soils. Heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile) and wood sage (Teucrium scorodonia) are found in more acidic areas. The higher areas support bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and common heather (Calluna vulgaris). Trees and shrubs include the wayfaring tree (Viburnum lantana), guelder rose (Viburnum opulus), whitebeam (Sorbus aria), privet (Ligustrum vulgare) and dogwood (Cornus sanguinea).|$|E
50|$|Astragalus {{is a large}} genus {{of about}} 3,000 species of herbs and small shrubs, {{belonging}} to the legume family Fabaceae and the subfamily Faboideae. It is the largest genus of plants in terms of described species. The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Common names include milkvetch (most species), locoweed (in North America, some species) and goat's-thorn (A. gummifer, A. tragacanthus). Some pale-flowered <b>vetches</b> are similar in appearance, but <b>vetches</b> are more vine-like.|$|R
50|$|Favourite {{food sources}} are {{flowering}} {{plants such as}} thistles; the queen also visits white deadnettle and <b>vetches,</b> while the male feeds on bramble, knapweed, lavender, and honeysuckles.|$|R
50|$|This bee feeds at {{many kinds}} of plants, such as milkweeds, prairie clovers, echinaceas, loosestrife, bergamot, {{pickerel}} weeds, rudbeckias, goldenrods, clovers, and <b>vetches.</b> The queens particularly favor legumes.|$|R
5|$|The {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} fields of the valley are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland, some of which {{date back to the}} most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Hedgerows support the nationally rare bithynian <b>vetch</b> (Vicia bithynica). Mature oak (Quercus) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and chestnuts (Castanea sativa). Elm (Ulmus) trees have been lost in this area, and dead/dying elms are also evident in the surrounding landscape.|$|E
5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and <b>vetch.</b> The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E
5|$|Ged flies back to Ogion on Gont, who crafts a new {{staff for}} him. Contrary to Gensher, Ogion insists that all {{creature}}s have a name, and advises Ged {{to confront the}} shadow creature. Ged pursues the creature in a small sailboat, until it lures him into a fog and wrecks the boat on a reef. Ged recovers {{with the help of}} an elderly couple marooned on the island, who give Ged part of a broken bracelet as a gift. Ged patches his boat and escapes the island, pursuing the creature into the East Reach. On the island of Iffish he meets his friend <b>Vetch,</b> who insists on joining him. They journey east far beyond the last known lands before they finally come upon the shadow. Here Ged realizes that the shadow has always been a part of his own spirit. Naming it with his own name, he merges with the shadow creature, understanding and accepting it as part of himself, and thus healing himself.|$|E
50|$|The {{caterpillar}} (larva) is dark grey with a {{black line}} above a line of white interrupted by yellow bands. The caterpillar's food plants are <b>vetches</b> of the genus Coronilla.|$|R
25|$|Adults feed {{primarily}} on nectar of Thistles (Cirsium spp. and Carduus spp.), Knapweeds (Centaurea spp.), Dandelion (Taraxacum), Fleabane (Pulicaria dysenterica), Marjoram (Origanum vulgare), Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), and <b>Vetches</b> (Vicia spp.).|$|R
50|$|This species creates {{above-ground}} nests in grassland {{and other}} open habitat types. It feeds at {{many types of}} plants, including thistles, prairie clovers, delphiniums, teasels, echinacea, bergamot, penstemons, clovers, and <b>vetches.</b>|$|R
5|$|Theophrastus groups {{together}} the cereals and the legumes (peas and beans), and includes millet and other many-seeded plants like sesame also. These {{can only be}} grown from seed. They can be sown early, as with wheat, barley and beans, or in spring after the equinox, for plants like lentils, tares and peas. <b>Vetch</b> and chickpeas can, he reports, be sown at either season. When sprouting, beans form a shape like a penis, from which the root grows down and the leafy stem upwards. Wheat and barley flower {{for four or five}} days, whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. Wheat varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth habit and food value. In a place near Bactra in Asia the wheat grains are said to grow as big as the stone of an olive, whereas pulses do not in Theophrastus's view vary to the same extent.|$|E
5|$|Francis Nicholson and Samuel <b>Vetch</b> {{organized}} {{an ambitious}} assault against New France in 1709, with some financial and logistical {{support from the}} queen. The plan involved an overland assault on Montreal via Lake Champlain and a sea-based assault by naval forces against Quebec. The land expedition reached {{the southern end of}} Lake Champlain, but it was called off when the promised naval support never materialized for the attack on Quebec. (Those forces were diverted to support Portugal.) The Iroquois had made vague promises of support for this effort, but successfully delayed sending support until it seemed clear that the expedition was going to fail. After this failure, Nicholson and Schuyler traveled to London accompanied by King Hendrick and other sachems to arouse interest in the North American frontier war. The Indian delegation caused a sensation in London, and Queen Anne granted them an audience. Nicholson and Schuyler were successful in their endeavor: the queen gave support for Nicholson's successful capture of Port Royal in 1710. With that success under his belt, Nicholson again returned to England and gained support for a renewed attempt on Quebec in 1711.|$|E
25|$|However, she reveals she {{has been}} working with <b>Vetch</b> all along, who appears and congratulates her on her deception. <b>Vetch</b> tells Haven that Chess is one of his spies, {{deployed}} throughout his slave colonies to keep watch for anyone speaking of the Golden Voice. <b>Vetch</b> explains he had Chess call Haven away from the Mount of Sighs immediately after ringing the bell because the legend says that if the person who rings the bell does not remain on the Mount until Athellion's return, Athellion must return to wherever that person is - thus <b>Vetch</b> plans to wait until Athellion appears to Haven, and then kill him. With no more use for Chess, <b>Vetch</b> decides she can die with Haven. At this moment, Athellion arrives, telling <b>Vetch</b> he will surrender if Haven and Chess are spared. <b>Vetch</b> agrees, imprisoning them, and bringing Athellion back to the Mount of Sighs.|$|E
50|$|Ovid {{says that}} hares and goats—animals {{considered}} fertile and salacious—were ceremonially released {{as part of}} the festivities. Persius says that the crowd was pelted with <b>vetches,</b> beans, and lupins, also symbols of fertility.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Fabaceae species, {{including}} Stylosanthes biflora and Aeschynomene species. Adults {{feed on the}} nectar {{of various}} flowers including joint <b>vetches</b> and shepherd's needle, and are the principal pollinators of Cnidoscolus urens.|$|R
50|$|From late June {{to early}} August, Herschel Island {{witnesses}} {{an explosion of}} colour. Its humid maritime climate {{during the growing season}} fosters a lush growth of tundra flowers, including <b>vetches,</b> louseworts, Arctic lupines, arnicas, and forget-me-nots.|$|R
