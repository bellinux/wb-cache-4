40|$|Lubricating oil {{requirement}} is increasing {{day by day}} {{with the establishment of}} new industries, increase in number of <b>vehicular</b> <b>transports</b> and mechanization of agriculture. Generated waste oil can be considered as a source of pollution or as a resource depending on the methods of utilization and management. This study compares different end-uses of waste oil and develops a pathway through which basic properties of the base-oil can be retrieved. In this study a pilot scale setup of conventional acid-clay technique was established to recover waste oil collected from different sources and a set of experimental runs were conducted by varying the different process variables. Effects of the operating variables on the product quality are also discussed in this article. The recovery of regenerated base-oil was found to be in between 62 to 66 percent from this experimental study...|$|R

25|$|One {{key feature}} of a {{hydrogen}} economy {{would be that}} in mobile applications (primarily <b>vehicular</b> <b>transport)</b> energy generation and use could be decoupled. The primary energy source would need no longer travel with the vehicle, as it currently does with hydrocarbon fuels. Instead of tailpipes creating dispersed emissions, the energy (and pollution) could be generated from point sources such as large-scale, centralized facilities with improved efficiency. This would allow the possibility of technologies such as carbon sequestration, which are otherwise impossible for mobile applications. Alternatively, distributed energy generation schemes (such as small scale renewable energy sources) could be used, possibly associated with hydrogen stations.|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s, Levin {{made three}} {{television}} series for Channel 4. The first, Hannibal's Footsteps, screened in 1985, showed Levin walking the presumed route taken by Hannibal when he invaded Italy in 218 BC.. The programme followed Levin's 320-mile journey from Aigues-Mortes to the crossing into Italy in the Queyras valley. He remained true to his declared intention of eschewing {{all forms of}} <b>vehicular</b> <b>transport,</b> and walked all the way, {{with the exception of}} his crossing the Rhone, rowing himself in a small boat. He followed this with To the End of the Rhine in 1987, following the Rhine from its two sources, the Hinterrhein and the Vorderrhein, in Switzerland, to its estuary at Rotterdam, [...] to the north. In between he joined the Swiss citizen army on manoeuvres, visited Liechtenstein bankers, zig-zagged the Swiss–German border at Lake Constance, attended the Schubertiade at Hohenems and the opera at Bregenz, took the waters at Baden-Baden, visited the manufacturers of eau de Cologne, and paid tribute to Erasmus at Basle. The last of the three series was in 1989, A Walk up Fifth Avenue in New York, from Washington Square to the Harlem River. In this series he encountered extremes of wealth and poverty, and met a wide variety of people, some famous (such as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Donald Trump) and some not (including a sword-swallowing unicyclist, and a bag lady in Central Park). He wrote books based on each of the three series, published in 1985, 1987 and 1989 respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{manner of}} this type of field {{fortification}} was to close potential <b>vehicular</b> <b>transport</b> and attack routes with multiplied anti-tank ditches, hedgehogs, dragon's teeth and mine fields. These obstacle-zone are followed by a quite small but peculiarly complex system of ditches and barbed wire obstacles, which protects the anti-tank barrier against sappers, bridge-layer tanks and engineer teams. The semi-mobile engagement is the main point, soldiers fight in open firing positions, while bunkers served as only shelters during bombardments. Thus it is possible to quickly reallocate between the points of defense (manpower not locked in pillboxes), and counterattacks feasible by defense force. The main defense line usually lies at hilltop {{on the edge of a}} forest, divided into circularly defensible independent subsectors (platoon size) which allow a full 360° arc of fire. A sector includes 3 (or more) trench-rings and no more than a few ferro-concrete shelters surrounded by a wide zone of anti-personnel obstacles and 2 (or more) [...] "V" [...] or [...] "U" [...] shaped anti-tank trenches or dragon's teeth. 3-4 independent sectors connect by communication trenches into a defensive zone or fortress (company or battalion size).|$|E

40|$|Driving {{simulators}} {{have become}} useful research tools {{for the institution}} and laboratories which are studying in different fields of <b>vehicular</b> and <b>transport</b> design to increase road safety. Although classical washout filters are broadly used because of their short processing time, simplicity and ease of adjust, they have some disadvantages such as generation of wrong sensation of motions, false cue motions, and also their tuning process which {{is focused on the}} worst case situations leading to a poor usage of the workspace. The aim {{of this study is to}} propose a new motion cueing algorithm that can accurately transform vehicle specific force into simulator platform motions at high fidelity within the simulator’s physical limitations. This method is proposed to compensate wrong cueing motion caused by saturation of tilt coordination rate limit using an adaptive correcting signal based on added fuzzy logic into translational channel to minimize the human sensation error and exploit the platform more efficiently...|$|R
40|$|Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) {{could be}} an {{important}} component of next-generation Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). It provides wireless connectivity among traveling vehicles to exchange real-time road condition and traffic information to support safe driving and traffic management. IVC system can be considered as a special form of mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). The MANET and IVC are both hot issues for researches. However, there are few domestic literatures combining the two topics. Most of them are discussed separately. Thus, the studies on architecture and protocols of mobile ad-hoc network have great value for establishing vehicular networks. The simulating method is an available way to assess the performance of networks. This paper has a specific description about the network simulator NS- 2. Under the basic of simulating practices, the design method and procedure for MANET simulation are summarized in detail. In this report, two simple IVC scenarios are implemented on NS- 2. The quantitative metrics like network throughput, delay and packet-loss are used to assess the performance of MANET for IVC under different <b>vehicular</b> speeds, <b>transport</b> layer protocols and routing protocols. The results indicate that MANET can be used for IVC well. The different speeds and protocols should be chosen based on specific IVC scenarios...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe growing {{complexity}} of logistics and its importance {{as a major}} economic activity has raised the profile of information and communication technology (ICT) as means to improve the levels of visibility, responsiveness and efficiency in supply chains relying in multimodal transport operations. With the use of wireless <b>vehicular</b> networks, Intelligent <b>Transport</b> Systems (ITS) {{have the potential to}} shape the future of multimodal logistics. In the absence of sophisticated ICT tools, the potential role and contribution of ITS and in particular wireless vehicular networks play in logistics is investigated in a multimodal case of a port terminal handling bulk material transported by sea, which is unloaded into haulage vehicles. Event flow mapping and network modelling analysis are used to determine the feasibility of ITS to support real-time data traffic related to the exchange of messages, which are representative of the flow of events taking place in multimodal logistics and which can be associated to high-impact capabilities with economic repercussions such as track and trace...|$|R

40|$|The phenomenal {{increase}} in <b>vehicular</b> ownership and <b>transport</b> demand {{during the past}} two decades have made the transport sector become the major source of air and noise pollution in many cities in the Republic of Korea. Consequently, environmental sustainability has become a major issue of concern in transport development. Various policy instruments and other measures have been applied or are under consideration to contain transport demand and greenhouse gas emissions to promote sustainable transport development in the Republic of Korea. Evaluating the effectiveness of a policy measure is important in deciding its relevance. A framework has been developed in this paper which can be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of policy measures. In this paper, we estimate the indicators related to transport and the environment in the Republic of Korea up to 2020. A forecast of vehicle ownership was made since it was the most important parameter for estimating road travel and energy demand in the transport sector. The estimation was done by a lagged power growth function, with real income and cost of vehicle ownership a...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the repercussions <b>vehicular</b> road <b>transport</b> {{emissions}} have on global warming potential (GWP), and the need to address the issue considering methodological challenges facing road transportation in Nigeria. Specific objectives of the study includes to determine the emission level in the country, to evaluate the GWP and to develop a emission mapping network on trunk A roads in Nigeria. Accurate information on these emissions is required to strengthen the mitigation and adaptation ability of the country to tackle climate change. The study relied on direct measurement technique supported by literature as well as questionnaires administered on the organised vehicle fleet operators and road traffic management agency as data gathering methods. Also, detailed analysis of questionnaires responses was carried out. Results show that road transport account for over 14 % of greenhouse gases. Survey findings indicate that excessive smoke emission offence accounts for 1 - 2 % of the annual road traffic offences in Nigeria. Using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 16, five fitted simple linear regression models were developed. With these fitted models it is possible to map the gas concentrations on the kilometre travelled. Examination of the National Vehicle Identification Scheme (NVIS) revealed a rise in the periodic plate number generation from yearly record of 788, 169 in 2001 to 791, 832 in 2009. Human capacity requirements, based on yearly Drivers Licence (DL) processed, increased by 55 % between 2000 and 2010. Three mutual strategies namely renewed urban and rural road transport infrastructure availability, regular fleet maintenance and capacities building for improved behavioural change of road users were recommended to help control road transport emissions. These measures if inflexibly implemented will change the transport sector from being a major global warming risk factor to that of Eco-friendly sector...|$|R

40|$|Walking is {{the most}} {{primitive}} mode of transportation. In modern age this primary mode has not become obsolete as it furnishes access to those stretches of places which are not reachable by any <b>vehicular</b> mode of <b>transport.</b> Pedestrians are multiplying day by day in cities. Hence Pedestrian motion has immensely become a complex phenomenon. It is important to make out critical aspects of pedestrian motion to avoid collisions between pedestrians or any unexpected occurrence that has many precedents, like stampede. To understand this fuzzy motion, {{it is important to}} closely oversee this process of human movement and relate it to some mathematical form for easy understanding. In this study, a lot of data related to pedestrian motion are collected from various places in eastern India. The study has mainly observed and recorded speed, flow and density of individual pedestrians. Statistical analysis is done here for comparing different types of data sets. Behaviours of pedestrians on different facilities and how these behaviours affect the flow parameters are studied here. The study analyzes Level of service of different pedestrian facilities. Oscillation phenomena occurring at bottlenecks are illustrated taking reference from already conducted experiments by other researchers. In this study a model is developed to mimic the pedestrian flow while moving along a corridor or evacuating from a closed space. The model is a microscopic discrete model using cellular automata. The model imitates some simple rules practiced by the pedestrians for decision making while moving in a space. It can explain the lane changing phenomena in pedestrian streams. The model is very realistic in the direction choice approach of pedestrians. It is capable of modelling different crowd levels.
