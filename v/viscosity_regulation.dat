40|$|Gastro-intestinal (GI) {{nematodes}} are {{an important}} cause of disease and economical loss in livestock industries. The abomasal nematode Ostertagia ostertagi and the intestinal nematode Cooperia oncophora {{are among the most}} common parasites infecting cattle in temperate climate regions. In order to develop new therapeutics, a fundamental understanding of the processes involved in protective immunity is needed. The potential role of mucins and other defensive compounds (trefoil factors/TFF and galectins/LGALS) is described. Nine membrane-bound and six secreted mucins were identified in the bovine genome. The protein architecture of the membrane bound mucins was similar between humans and cattle, while the protein architecture of the gel forming mucins seemed less conserved. The transcriptional distribution of both mucins and mucin glycosyltransferases was investigated in the GI tract of nematode-free cattle. Both sets of genes showed a tissuespecific transcritpion profile and species-specific differences were also observed. Subsequently, changes in the transcription of mucins, mucin glycosyltransferases and TFFs were investigated in the abomasal mucosa during primary and repeated infections with O. ostertagi. This study showed that the mucin, TFF and glycosyltransferase transcription levels were significantly altered in the abomasal mucosa during primary O. ostertagi infection in cattle. Although the changes in mucin biosynthesis started early after infection, the major effects were observed when adult worms were present at the mucosal surface. In addition, the transcriptional distribution of ten galectins was investigated in the GI tract of uninfected cattle. The majority of the galectins were upregulated at an early time point after infection, before the appearance of adult worms. LGALS 1 was also upregulated in repeatedly infected animals, possible indication that it might be involved in the development of protective immunity. LGALS 11 was inducibly and strongly upregulated during both primary and repeated infections with O. ostertagi. The changes in these components in the abomasum during O. ostertagi infections were compared with changes in the small intestine after primary and repeated infections with C. oncophora. The identification of components that are commonly or differentially induced during O. ostertagi and C. oncophora infections might be useful to identify mechanisms involved in protection. For some glycosyltransferases and galectins, differences were observed in the changes in transcription levels. Other molecules were upregulated during primary infection with both parasite species. Similar to what was observed during O. ostertagi infection, LGALS 11 was inducible and strongly upregulated after both primary and repeated infections with C. oncophora. Since LGALS 11 was strongly upregulated during primary and repeated O. ostertagi and C. oncophora infections, this galectin was further investigated. LGALS 11 induction was associated with the proliferation and de-differentiation of abomasal epithelial cells in culture, independently from the presence of O. ostertagi antigens. In addition, LGALS 11 transcript was detected in the abomasal lymph nodes, where it was found in MHCII+ cells; however transcription levels were not altered after primary O. ostertagi infection. In the small intestine, LGALS 11 was not only induced by the GI nematode C. oncophora, but also by the protozoan parasite Giardia duodenalis. Although LGALS 11 was also transcribed in the lungs, transcription levels were not altered after a natural infection with the lung nematode Dictyocaulus viviparus. These data suggest that LGALS 11 induction is rather an undirect effect of the parasite on the epithelium. Upregulation of LGALS 11 as a response to parasitic infections is seemingly restricted to the GI tract. A first reason for the different response during O. ostertagi and C. oncophora infection could be related to morphological and physiological differences between the abomasum and the small intestine. A second possible reason are differences in host-parasite interactions such as pathophysiology and immunity. The role of the observed changes during GI nematode infections remains unclear. It was suggested that changes in the mucin barrier during primary infection are not protective since expulsion of O. ostertagi {{at this stage of the}} infection is uncommon and levels of mucin-related genes remained unchanged after repeated infections. Galectins on the other hand, especially LGALS 1 and LGALS 9, could be involved in directing the immune response towards a Th 2 response during O. ostertagi infection. LGALS 11 could play a role in changing mucus <b>viscosity,</b> <b>regulation</b> of epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, and immune cell signaling...|$|E
