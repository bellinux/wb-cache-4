50|$|In 1958, the {{modified}} Proctor compaction test was developed as an ASTM standard. A higher and more relevant compaction standard was necessary. There were larger and heavier compaction equipment, like large <b>vibratory</b> <b>compactors</b> and heavier steel-face rollers. This equipment could produce higher dry densities in soils along with greater stability. These improved properties {{allowed for the}} transport of far heavier truck loads over roads and highways. During the 1970s and early 1980s {{the modified}} Proctor test became more widely used as a modern replacement for the standard Proctor test.|$|R
50|$|On site, the geocell {{sections}} are fastened {{together and}} placed {{directly on the}} subsoil's surface or on a geotextile filter placed on the subgrade surface and propped open in an accordion-like fashion with an external stretcher assembly. The sections expand to an area of several tens of meters and consist of hundreds of individual cells, depending on the section and cell size. They are then filled with various infill materials, such as soil, sand, aggregate or recycled materials and then compacted using <b>vibratory</b> <b>compactors.</b> Surface layers many be of asphalt or unbound gravel materials.|$|R
40|$|Achieving {{the desired}} density during field {{compaction}} of asphalt mixes {{is critical to}} meeting the design specifications of an asphalt pavement. Existing techniques measure the density of asphalt mixes at a discrete number of points. As such, the process is cumbersome, time consuming, and is not indicative of the overall compaction achieved unless large amounts of data is collected and analyzed. In this paper, {{the concept of a}} novel neural network-based asphalt compaction analyzer capable of predicting the density continuously, in real time, during the construction of the pavement is presented. The concept is verified using laboratory data from an asphalt <b>vibratory</b> <b>compactor</b> (AVC). The compaction analyzer is based on the hypothesis that a <b>vibratory</b> <b>compactor</b> and the hot mix asphalt (HMA) mat form a coupled system having unique vibration properties. The measured vibrations of the compactor along with the process parameters such as lift thickness, mix type, mix temperature, and compaction pressure can be used to predict the density of the asphalt mat. Vibration data obtained during compaction of asphalt mixes in the laboratory is used to design and train the neural network (NN). The trained neural network is then used to continuously predict the degree of compaction in real time. Th...|$|E
40|$|The {{design life}} of porous asphalt is shorter than dense mix as a {{consequence}} of permeability loss due to clogging and poor resistance to disintegration. To mitigate problems associated with clogging, double layer porous asphalt has been constructed in the Netherlands. This paper investigated a development of a new grading design for porous asphalt by varying percentage of aggregate with maximum sizes of 20, 14 and 10 mm; a theory of packing was used. The most common method used for grading design is based on empirical, which does not relate the packing behaviour of the aggregate mass. The packing theory used in this study was facilitated by a <b>vibratory</b> <b>compactor.</b> It was found that mixtures containing aggregate sizes 14 and 10 mm have a good permeability and stability, when vibrated for 65 second with a frequency of 40 Hz, while for aggregates containing 20 mm, to achieve the requirement for Marshall stability, the gradation needs to be modified. Properties of porous asphalt based on packing theory are better from the empirical grading from Spain (P- 12) ...|$|E
40|$|As well known, the {{laboratory}} testing of mechanical and volumetric properties of asphalt concrete {{is carried out}} by working on test specimens compacted according to specific reference Standards. One of the major problems, that still undertake the scientific research sector, is to successfully reproduce in laboratory the compaction process that asphalt concretes undergoes during the in situ placement. Traditionally the mainly technique of compaction is the unidirectional-impulsive one {{that leads to the}} creation of appreciably different structures from those that occur in the pavement layers. In unidirectional-impulsive compaction the aggregate moves mainly along vertical direction with limited rotation possibility, so it is difficult to reach the maximum density and resistance configuration. These limitations are overcome with the introduction of the SHRP gyratory compaction which is capable of continuously changing the direction of compaction with combined normal and tangential actions. In this paper the Authors propose an alternative to the unidirectional-impulsive bituminous mixtures compaction procedure based {{on the use of the}} <b>vibratory</b> <b>compactor,</b> a device introduced by UNI-EN- 12697 - 32 (2007) in order to determine the bituminous mixtures’ density. The objective of the study is, therefore, to assess and compare the mechanical resistance and porosity performed by bituminous mixtures, compacted by the two mentioned compaction techniques (unidirectional-impulsive and vibrational). With reference to bituminous mixtures object of study, the Authors propose correlations that allow to link mechanical and volumetric parameters of mixtures to the change of the compaction technique, the compaction energy and the compaction time...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to employ {{time-delay}} feedback to anti-control a permanent magnet DC (PMDC) motor system for <b>vibratory</b> <b>compactors,</b> and hence implement a new electrically chaotic compactor. Firstly, the dynamic model of the anti-controlled PMDC motor system and the proposed electrically chaotic compactor are formulated. Secondly, a nonlinear map is derived to analyze the chaotic criterion of the anti-controlled PMDC motor system. Then, numerical computations are used to investigate the dynamics of the proposed electrically chaotic compactor. Finally, a series of simulations are conducted to verify that the proposed electrically chaotic compactor not only offers better compaction effects than the conventional one, but also provides higher flexibility than the mechanically chaotic compactor. © 2006. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|After being {{spread by}} the dozer, the RCC was {{compacted}} {{by a pair}} of Ingersoll Rand rollers — a DD125 and, for working close to the edge forms, a DD24.

It opened its research laboratory in 1948 and manufactured the first vibratory road roller in 1953. The site in Karlskrona opened in 1960, which made heavy rollers {{and had the}} company's technical centre. The CA 25 road roller introduced in 1970 became the world's leading compaction roller. It {{changed its name to}} Dynapac Maskin AB in 1973; at this moment the company rapidly expanded its product range. Its main product range was vibratory road rollers. In 1980 it brought out its first planer.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} issues that have been {{discussed}} among asphalt technologists is the minimum lift thickness necessary to provide a high probability of adequate compaction under a reasonable compactive effort. In many cases, pavements constructed with thin lifts {{have been difficult to}} compact to the desired density level. Thinner lifts tend to cool faster and prevent particle orientation during compaction. To date, little research has been performed to determine the minimum desired lift thickness needed to facilitate optimum compaction. This research project was undertaken to determine the recommended minimum lift thickness. A total of 36 mixes were designed comprising various gradations and aggregate types. Laboratory samples were prepared using both a Superpave gyratory compactor (SGC) and an automated <b>vibratory</b> <b>compactor</b> (AVC). Seven field sections were also constructed to evaluate the relationship between air voids and thickness to nominal maximum aggregate size (t/NMAS). The results of the study indicated that t/NMAS has {{a significant impact on the}} compactibility of HMA mixtures. For improved compactibility, it is recommended that the t/NMAS be at least 3. 0 for fine-graded mixes and at least 4. 0 for coarse-graded mixes. Layers thinner than that recommended can be constructed but will likely require more compactive effort to achieve adequate density. The cooling rate for mixes less than 38 mm is very high making compaction difficult. Hence for best results, the thickness should be at least 38 mm even during warm weather. Paving in cold weather may require an even greater layer thickness. The work reported in this report was a part of NCHRP 9 - 27...|$|E
40|$|Several new {{processes}} {{have been}} developed to reduce the mixing and compaction temperatures of hot mix asphalt without sacrificing the quality of the resulting pavement. Three potential warm mix asphalt processes were evaluated in this study. They were Aspha-min®, Sasobit®, and Evotherm®. A laboratory study was conducted to determine the applicability of these processes to typical paving operations and environmental conditions commonly found in the United States, including the performance of the mixes in quick traffic turn-over situations and high temperature conditions. All three processes were shown to improve the compactability of mixtures in both the SGC and <b>vibratory</b> <b>compactor.</b> Statistics indicated an overall reduction in air voids. Improved compaction was noted at temperatures as low as 190 °F (88 °C). Superpave gyratory compactor results indicated that Aspha-min®, Sasobit®, and Evotherm ® may lower the optimum asphalt content. The addition of Aspha-min®, Sasobit®, or Evotherm ® did not affect the resilient modulus of an asphalt mix nor did they increase the rutting potential of an asphalt mix as measured by the Asphalt Pavement Analyzer. The rutting potential did increase with decreasing mixing and compaction temperatures, which {{may be related to the}} decreased aging of the binder resulting from the lower temperatures. There was no evidence of differing strength gain with time for the mixes containing the three processes as compared to the control mixes indicating that a prolonged cure time before opening to traffic is not an issue. The lower compaction temperature used when producing warm asphalt may increase the potential for moisture damage. Overall, Aspha-min®, Sasobit®, and Evotherm ® appear to be viable tools for reducing mixing and compaction temperatures that can be readily added to hot mix asphalt. Reductions in mixing and compaction temperatures are expected to reduce fuel costs, reduce emissions...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} ride {{dynamics}} of typical North-American <b>vibratory</b> soil <b>compactors</b> via analytical and experimental methods. In-plane ride dynamic {{models of the}} vehicle are formulated to evaluate ride vibration responses of the vehicle in the transit mode on undeformable terrain surfaces with the roller vibrator off. An in-plane dynamic model is also formulated to study the compaction mode dynamics at lower speeds on elasto-plastic soil subject to roller induced vibration. Field measurements were conducted to characterize the ride vibration environments during the two modes of operations. The ride dynamic models of the soil compactor are thus analyzed to study its whole-body vibration environment while operating on undeformable random terrain surfaces. The modeling of the equipment in compaction mode of operation, however, gives insight over {{the efficiency of the}} compactor as a tool aimed to perform compaction of soil layers by plastic deformation (compression). The ride vibration environment of the vehicle and its compaction capability is subsequently assessed using the ISO- 2631 - 1 (1997) guidelines and commonly accepted compaction criteria, respectively. The validity of the proposed model is demonstrated by comparing the model responses with the measured data. Comprehensive parametric analyses were subsequently performed to study the influences of variations in various design and operating parameters on the ride quality and the compaction efficiency of the mobile equipment. The results of the study are utilized to propose desirable design and operating parameters of the <b>vibratory</b> soil <b>compactor</b> for enhancement of its ride vibration environment and compaction performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the {{research}} {{was to examine the}} possibilities of using fast, new test procedures in service trench construction, to consider the validity of the information provided by such procedures, and to provide a comparison between the new test procedures and existing procedures embodied in the legislation and guidelines. In the course of the study, the new spot-based fast processes (dynamic plate loading test, sounding by means of service trench probe) were employed in addition to the established spot-based procedures (density measurement to DIN 18 125, radiometric density measurement, static plate loading test to DIN 18 134, soundings to DIN 4 094). The use of wide-area dynamic test procedures using vibratory rollers and <b>vibratory</b> <b>compactors</b> was also studied. The fast test methods, particularly dynamic plate loading test and wide-area dynamic density monitoring, are subject to influence not only from the ground type (grain distribution, grain quality, water content, etc.), but also from the trench geometry. Variations in the stiffness around the measuring point and the distance from trench fittings (pipes, manholes, trench irregularities) also have a bearing. Provided certain side constraints are taken into consideration, the service trench probe and dynamic plate loading equipment can be used for density monitoring, even in narrow service trenches. The dynamic loading plate can also be used for testing stiffness. Good correlations were often reached between the conventional and the new test results on the ground types tested. Wide-area dynamic density monitoring in service trenches can at present be used with vibratory rollers only if large distances are maintained between the acceleration recorder and interferences (trench irregularities, trench slopes, manholes, pipes, etc.). Vibratory plates caused technical measurement problems which could not be solved {{in the course of this}} research project. (orig.)

40|$|This article proposes and {{implements}} a {{class of}} chaotic motors for electric compaction. The key {{is to develop a}} design approach for the permanent magnets (PMs) of doubly salient PM (DSPM) motors {{in such a way that}} chaotic motion can be naturally produced. The bifurcation diagram is employed to derive the threshold of chaoization in terms of PM flux, while the corresponding phase-plane trajectories are used to characterize the chaotic motion. A practical three-phase 128 -pole DSPM motor is used for exemplification. The proposed chaotic motor is critically assessed for application to a <b>vibratory</b> soil <b>compactor,</b> which is proven to offer better compaction performance than its counterparts.

Densities of the tailings and zone of compaction influence, compactive effort, and cost of equipment are related {{to changes in the}} factor of safety for specific grain-sized tailings and embankment configurations. Field testing was accomplished in two distinct phases. The first phase investigated the effectiveness of using a nuclear gauge on metal and nonmetal tailings to produce rapid, instantaneous measurements of moisture content, wet density, and dry density. The results of the nuclear gauge testing are presented in chapter 1. Chapter 2 presents a comparison of the compactive effectiveness of three different pieces of construction equipment on a coarse-grained metal tailings pond.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the dynamic {{modelling}} of a <b>vibratory</b> asphalt <b>compactor.</b> A compactor is a machine of road building site. Its task {{is to increase the}} density of the asphalt. The aim of the study is to measure contact forces wrenches between the drums of the compactor and the bituminous mix. These drums vibrate. Traditional techniques of robotics are used to model the compactor as an articulated mechanical system. In order to reach our objective, the dynamic model is limited to the clamp-drum unit. Moreover, this model is adapted to our system of measurements by replacing some lagrangian variables by some Euler variables. In this manner, it is proved {{that it is possible to}} get the contact forces wrench. During a real worksite, it has been possible for the first time to measure the contact forces applied by a compactor. Copyright c© 2005 IFAC...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to conduct a laboratory test program on how much induced vibrations on concrete during the period between initial set and final set affect the attainable strength of concrete.

5000|$|In construction, {{there are}} three main types of compactor: the plate, the [...] "jumping jack" [...] and the road roller. The roller type compactors are used for {{compacting}} crushed rock as the base layer underneath concrete or stone foundations or slabs. The plate <b>compactor</b> (<b>vibratory</b> rammer) has a large vibrating baseplate and is suited for creating a level grade, while the jumping jack compactor has a smaller foot. The jumping jack type is mainly used to compact the backfill in narrow trenches for water or gas supply pipes etc. Road rollers may also have vibrating rollers.|$|R
40|$|The {{inadequate}} of compaction of backfills near abutments, approach {{areas of}} culverts, and smaller widened portions of roads result in settlement of layers and premature failure of pavement. Compaction in these constrained areas {{is difficult because}} of the difficulty in maneuvering of compacting equipment such as heavy rollers. Various types of light compacting equipment like rammers, <b>vibratory</b> plate <b>compactors,</b> single-drum walk-behind rollers, and double-drum walk-behind rollers are being used for compaction of the materials in constrained areas. Locally available loamy soil was compacted to different layer thicknesses of 50, 100, 150, and 200 mm using selected plate compactors, single-drum walk-behind rollers, and double-drum walk-behind rollers. Field moisture-density relationships for this equipment are established. The studies indicate that the roller optimum moisture content (ROMC) is higher than the optimum moisture content (OMC) of Proctor compaction even after 10 passes for all the light compacting equipment used. The regression equations developed for predicting field density as a function of compacting moisture content in the field, number of passes, and thickness of layer for all the light compacting equipment can be used during construction.

40|$|Laboratory {{and field}} {{hydraulic}} conductivity tests {{have been conducted}} on soil samples to develop and verify the zone of acceptance for liner placement. Compaction testing and flexible wall hydraulic conductivity tests were performed on fifteen (15) samples to determine the dry unit weight, molding water content, and laboratory permeability. Five of the fifteen samples were compacted at Standard proctor energy, five were compacted at 75 percent of Standard proctor energy, and five were compacted at 50 percent of Standard proctor energy. The results obtained from the laboratory portion of the testing program (the zone of acceptance) are presented. A ten foot-long by ten foot-foot wide by four foot tall box was created in an environmentally controlled environment (indoor lab). Six inches of sand {{were placed in the}} bottom of the box and overlain with a geotextile filter fabric. An eight-inch thick loose lift of clay was then placed, and compacted into a six-inch thick lift using two passes of a <b>vibratory</b> plate <b>compactor.</b> Five nuclear density tests were conducted on the first lift to ensure the soil was compacted within the zone of acceptance. This procedure was then continued for the remaining three lifts. A two-stage borehole (TSB) hydraulic conductivity test was conducted at the center of the test pad. The first stage (vertical) was conducted at 10 inches below the top of the liner, and the second stage (horizontal) was conducted from 10 inches to 16 inches below the top of the liner. The results obtained from the environmentally controlled TSB test were compared against tests conducted on landfill liner tests pads constructed at three different landfills within the state of Missouri. Two of the landfill liner tests pads were covered with tents while one was not covered. The results obtained from the environmentally controlled TSB did not display the same changes in hydraulic conductivity associated with diurnal cycles of direct sunlight that were observed in the landfill test pads. These diurnal cycles may result in a placement technique being rejected...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{findings}} of extensive damage on geogrids used in a road embankment in northern Sweden, the Swedish Transport Administration (TRV) started to investigate the reason of these damages. Since the geogrids were installed at low temperature, below 0 °C, it was suspected that the damages were connected the low temperature. To analyse whether low temperatures have an influence on the extent of installation damages, both a half-scale setup and temperature controlled tensile tests have been carried out on geogrids. In total five different types of geogrids have been tested; 3 extruded polypropylene geogrids, 1 woven PET geogrid, and 1 welded PET geogrid. All geogrids had an aperture size of approximately 35 mm and specified tensile strength of approximately 40 kN/m. The Half-scale tests was conducted by building a small road embankment inside a freeze container, at the Luleå University of Technology (LTU). The embankment contained crushed aggregate, type 0 - 70 mm, and geogrids. The purpose of the half-scale test was to simulate installation of geogrids at different temperatures and thereby investigate whether low temperatures have an influence on the rate of installation damages. The half-scale test was done for each type of geogrid at the temperatures: + 20 °C, - 20 °C and - 30 °C. First, the geogrid was covered by 150 mm of crushed aggregate. Then a vibratory plate (160 kg) was used to compact the crushed aggregate. After each installation, the crushed aggregate was removed carefully by vacuum suction. The geogrid was removed and then analysed by visual control and tensile tests conducted according to ISO 10319 : 2008 (wide width tensile test). Results from the half-scale tests indicate that 2 out of 5 of the tested geogrids were affected by the testing procedure. The results indicate that: -        one of the geogrids of polyprophylene (here referred to as G 2) was more damaged at lower temperatures compared to installation at + 20 ° C. -        the geogrid of woven PET (here referred to as G 5) was less damaged at lower temperatures compared to installation at + 20 ° C. Results for the other geogrids are either inconsistent or shows no significant variation of the measured parameters as function of temperature. Hence, these results cannot be interpreted as damage during installation. Temperature controlled tensile tests were done by tensile testing single strands from the geogrids to failure, inside a temperature controlled chamber. The purpose of these tests was to investigate how the strength properties of the geogrids are affected by low temperature. The test was repeated 5 times for each geogrid and temperature (+ 20 °C, 0 °C, - 10 °C and - 20 °C). Force and strain was measured during the tests. The results from the temperature controlled tensile tests show that the maximum strain decreases with lower temperature for all tested geogrids. The maximum strain decreased by 16 % - 49 % when the temperature dropped from + 20 °C to - 20 °C. The results show that the tensile strength increases with lower temperature for all tested geogrids except for the welded PET geogrid (here referred to as G 1). For G 1 the tensile strength decreased by approximately 7 % at a temperature drop from + 20 °C to - 20 °C. For the woven PET geogrid (G 5) and the polypropylene geogrids (G 2 -G 3) the tensile strength increased between 13 %- 45 % at a temperature drop from + 20 °C to - 20 °C. The E-modulus increased at lower temperature for all tested geogrids. The secant E-modulus at 2 % strain increased by 13 %- 71 % at a temperature drop from + 20 °C to - 20 °C. Summarized conclusions from the tests: Strength properties changed for all tested geogrids as the temperature decreased. All tested geogrids got stiffer at lower temperatures. The magnitude of the effects is different for different geogrids. The tensile strength increased with lower temperature for all tested geogrids except for the welded PET geogrid, which got lower tensile strength at lower temperature. The half-scale test indicates that the amount of installation damages at geogrids can be dependent of the temperature at installation. However, these indications can only be seen at two out of five tested geogrids. The effect cannot be connected to a specific step in the installation procedure and cannot be explained by the results from the temperature controlled tensile tests. The results from the half-scale test have a statistically low reliability since only one installation for each temperature and geogrid type was done. The compaction equipment used during the test was small, and had low compaction energy compared to a <b>vibratory</b> roller <b>compactor</b> commonly used in construction work. With respect to the discussion above, further studies should be focusing on developing the half-scale test. It is suggested that the test is scaled up to a full-scale test in order to simulate a real installation as close as possible. The test should also be conducted several times for each geogrid at each temperature in order to enable statistical analyses...|$|R
