40|$|In Europe {{the driving}} force for {{developments}} on coating of plastic films is twofold: In addition to the general trend to reduce input materials cost {{there is a strong}} motivation also from the waste management side. The latter is given by the EU Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste, which leads to the introduction of cost intensive waste management systems all over Europe. For a packaging system waste management costs may be even higher than production costs. Therefore prospects are best for light weight specialized materials, for which <b>vacuum</b> <b>coated</b> films are prominent examples. Before this background our institute coordinates collaborative R&D projects in cooperation with more than 40 companies. Focus is on the needs of our industrial partners, supported by additional funding from national sources or the European Union. From activities in the following areas exemplary results will be shown: Improvement of the barrier properties of laminates on the basis of <b>vacuum</b> <b>coated</b> BOPP films; development of specific coating sources and processes; rear and front side films for solar modules.

40|$|Due to {{the demand}} of the {{packaging}} industry for cost effective high barrier packaging materials, {{the amount of}} <b>vacuum</b> web <b>coated</b> films grows annually by 6 to 8 %. In spite of the high application rate of these films, {{little is known about}} the relevant permeation mechanisms. In terms of a quantitative prediction, the mechanism of the oxygen permeation is well understood, but not enough for the water vapor and especially not for the aroma permeability. For all different substances the barrier properties of the final laminate result from the synergetic effect between the <b>vacuum</b> web <b>coated</b> barrier layer and the polymer layers next to it. For a systematic investigation, BOPP films were <b>vacuum</b> web <b>coated</b> with Aluminum and silicon oxide on industrial scale. In the next step, the different films were laminated against BOPP by applying different types of polyurethane adhesive. The permeabilities of oxygen, water vapor and aroma substances through the non-coated, <b>vacuum</b> web <b>coated</b> and laminated films were measured. Comparing these results with the AFM (atomic force microscopy) analysis of the barrier layers, the most critical steps along the production chain can be identified for producing laminates that show a higher barrier against the different permeating substances...|$|R

For final packaging applications, coated layers are normally protected by laminating to another film. On laboratory as well as industial scale, the influence of various production parameters on the permeation through coated barrier films and final high barrier laminates was studied by using different types of substrate films, different kinds of pretreatment, different inorganic coating materials anddifferent lamination adhesives.

In 1978, the 1.55-m telescope was used to [...] "discover the moon of dwarf planet Pluto, named 'Charon'". (Pluto itself was discovered in 1930, across town at Lowell Observatory).

40|$|The use of <b>vacuum</b> <b>coating</b> {{is mostly}} limited to {{production}} of high fat containing extruded aqua and pet diets. The physical characteristics of extrudates are favourable for <b>vacuum</b> <b>coating</b> {{due to their}} high porosity and durability. However, with pelleted feed for broilers, there are potentially several opportunities, {{but there are also}} challenges; these are explored here. The opportunities identified were inclusion of high level of oils, protected delivery of feed additives (e. g., enzymes, probiotics, vaccines, etc.), improved and safe use of offensive feed additives and improvement of shelf-life of feed and additives. Challenges include the relatively high density of pellets (low porosity) which limits liquid infusion, increased processing cost and decreased feed throughput. However, feed ingredients selection and alternating processing variables (temperature, moisture, die specifications etc.) were deemed to overcome the challenges of low porosity. Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the use of <b>vacuum</b> <b>coating</b> in pelleted feed. In the first experiment, the effect of particle size on post-pellet oil absorption (OA), porosity, pellet durability index (PDI) and bulk density were investigated. The three particle sizes for three grains (wheat, barley and corn) were pelleted using a 4. 7 mm die to get whole grain (WP), coarse (CP), and fine (FP) grind pellets. The pellets were coated with 15 % canola oil without (VC-) and with (VC+; 0. 3 bar) <b>vacuum</b> <b>coating.</b> The grain type was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the particle size when ground through either fine (3. 2 mm) or coarse (6. 4 mm) screen. With coarse grinding, the mean particle size was 1896, 1290 and 1057 µm, respectively for barley, wheat and corn; with fine grinding, the mean particle size was 1153, 767 and 732 µm, respectively. Porosity of CP from wheat and corn was significantly (P< 0. 01) higher than WP and FP. For barley, there was no difference in porosity of CP and FP but both were significantly higher than WP. For wheat, OA of CP was highest (P< 0. 01), but no significant difference was found between FP and WP. However, for barley, higher OA was found in FP followed by CP and WP. In corn, OA of CP was higher than for FP or WP. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>coating</b> (VC+) improved (P< 0. 01) OA of all pellets compared to VC-. Porosity was positively correlated with OA and negatively correlated to PDI and bulk density. Overall, the first experiment suggested that alteration of particle size and grain type could be the options for improving the oil absorption by <b>vacuum</b> <b>coating.</b> A second experiment was conducted to observe the effect of enzyme addition method (EAM; E-, without enzyme; PreE+, Pre-pellet addition of enzyme; PosE+, post-pellet addition of enzyme), conditioning temperature (CT; 65 or 95 °C) and coating method (CM; VC- or VC+) on broiler performance when fed wheat-rye-based diets. Enzyme addition (pre or post-pellet addition in comparison to without enzyme) significantly improved (P< 0. 01) the body weight at 21 and 35 d. Higher CT (95 °C) improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) in both starter (P< 0. 01) and grow/finish phase (P= 0. 04) and PDI of both starter and grow/finish pellets (P< 0. 01) when compared to low CT (65 °C). <b>Vacuum</b> <b>coating</b> did not have any effect on the diet extract viscosity, animal performance or digesta viscosity in either of the phases. However, with post-pellet <b>vacuum</b> <b>coating,</b> there was high retention of xylanase activity after processing. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>coating</b> significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced the relative length of small intestine of broilers at 21 d but not at 35 d. In the third experiment, broiler grow/finish diets were stored in an incubator (37 °C) to see if <b>vacuum</b> <b>coating</b> can improve the shelf-life of feed. The results showed post-pellet vacuum-coated pellets retained higher enzyme activity after 15 days of storage. Although no effect of <b>vacuum</b> <b>coating</b> on animal performance was observed, <b>vacuum</b> <b>coating</b> was able to protect the enzyme during processing and storage. Further work needs to be done to translate these benefits to improve animal performance, which might be achieved using various <b>vacuum</b> <b>coating</b> and processing conditions, and bioactives...|$|E
