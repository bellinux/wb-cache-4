40|$|Proponents of {{e-commerce}} {{have known}} for some time that limited participation by consumers partially reflects their concern over the privacy of personal information. To address consumer concerns, web site operators have employed security mechanisms, including privacy policy statements to increase their perceived trustworthiness. While empirical evidence is limited, there is some question regarding the ability of privacy policy statements to engender significantly greater levels of trust. The limited effectiveness of such statements may reflect their voluntary implementation, self-enforcement, and significant variance (protection and enforcement) from one web site to another. One possible remedy would be the imposition of legally mandated statements. This study examined the efficacy of legally mandated privacy policies vis-à-vis both <b>voluntary</b> <b>statements</b> of varying degrees of protection and the absence of any such statement. The results were mixed, as legally mandated privacy policy statements were found to be comparable to strong <b>voluntary</b> <b>statements,</b> but superior to none, weak or moderate policies.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} comparative {{evidence on}} {{corporate social responsibility}} disclosure (CSRD) practices {{by many of the}} world’s largest companies. Specifically, it investigates the relationship between company characteristics, institutional factors, the presence of a <b>voluntary</b> assurance <b>statement,</b> and internal contextual aspects with the extent of CSRD in sustainability reports. The thesis approach is based on legitimacy theory tenets to better explain the motivations of these prominent companies to communicate CSRD. The data collection focuses on the 2009 sustainability reports sourced from 460 highly visible public companies from 44 separate countries. Key Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) items are used as the benchmark disclosure checklist. The empirical results indicate that the average level of overall CSRD is 56. 8 percent. Labour practices is the most disclosed theme by companies (66. 4 percent) followed by economic (60. 2 percent), society (57. 0 percent), environmental (56. 7 percent), human rights (49. 0 percent), and product responsibility themes (46. 0 percent). Statistical analysis indicates that high-profile industries, the presence of a <b>voluntary</b> assurance <b>statement</b> and a corporate social responsibility committee positively influence the extent of corporate social responsibility disclosures. Interestingly, companies operating in emerging markets disclose more sustainability information than communitarian or Anglo-American jurisdictions. Consistent with legitimacy theory, these results suggest that companies which are more likely impacted by their community demonstrate higher accountability and transparency by increasing CSRD communication to better address stakeholders’ expectations. Overall, the empirical results have theoretical and practical implications for key stakeholders to improve drivers of CSRD. First, this thesis provides evidence that legitimacy theory can help explain the extent of corporate social responsibility disclosures. Second, this thesis adds new insights on the positive role of the <b>voluntary</b> assurance <b>statements</b> and corporate social responsibility committees in motivating companies to provide more extensive and higher credible sustainability reports...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} embraces {{themes of}} Management Sciences, Empirical Corporate Finance and Behavioral Finance, investigating the correspondence between socially responsible strategies of major Italian listed {{companies and the}} willingness of institutional and not investors to undertake sustainable corporate investments. It analyzes how the issuance of ratings involving the Environmental, Social and Governance dimensions (ESG Rating since now) of Italian listed companies may influence their financial performances on stock exchange markets. A marked focus will also be addressed to the attention that investors have paid {{in recent years to}} the usage of more than mere technical variables in investment portfolio building. The study highlights on one hand how Italian listed companies have reacted to bearing wave of the subprime mortgages crisis and Italian Sovereign Debt crisis, opting for a socially responsible and sustainable investment policy; on the other hand how institutional investment funds or investors so-called outsiders have adopted the ESG paradigm in their capital allocation. A lot of empirical works have been developed to study the potential relationship between corporate social responsibility activities and other traditional measures of a firm’s success. Moreover, various groups such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), have paid an increasing attention to the corporate social performances (CSP) of organizations since the 1990 s, regardless of their size and location. Hence, a socially responsible and sustainable strategic orientation could both on one hand reduce the risk profile of a company, {{and on the other hand}} allow a better fundraising on stock exchange markets. These advantages have created a substrate meant to develop standardized business tools of social reporting as well as the emergence of social stock exchange for “future proofed” bonds’ dealing (e. g. Social Stock Exchange - London). In fact, it would be enough to check the profile of major Italian companies, also medium and small, to understand how they have drawn over time <b>voluntary</b> <b>statements</b> such as Ethical Codes and Social Reports aimed at informing the market about not-accounting information. Such investor behavior, better known as Socially Responsible Investing, has upset the principles of Investment Theory, introducing a new paradigm that takes into account the social and environmental impact of capital allocation as well as the governance aspect if an investment is undertaken by an enterprise...|$|R
