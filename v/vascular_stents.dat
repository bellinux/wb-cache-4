50|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of <b>vascular</b> <b>stents</b> {{is the potential}} for restenosis via the development of a thick smooth muscle tissue inside the lumen, the so-called neointima. Development of a neointima is variable but can at times be so severe as to re-occlude the vessel lumen (restenosis), {{especially in the case of}} smaller diameter vessels, which often results in reintervention. Consequently, current research focuses on the reduction of neointima after stent placement. Substantial improvements have been made, including the use of more biocompatible materials, anti-inflammatory drug-eluting stents, resorbable stents, and others. Restenosis can be treated with a reintervention using the same method.|$|E
50|$|Very early {{after the}} launch of <b>vascular</b> <b>stents</b> Sigwart voiced caution {{regarding}} the purely mechanical support. One such case {{was that of a}} patient who, 3 months after implantation in the proximal left anterior descending artery, developed severe chest pain and angiography showed severe restenosis. Sigwart urged the surgeon to remove the stented segment and reported how ‘gazing at the massive tissue obstructing the stent lumen, the hypothesis of mechanical support for the prevention of restenosis looked like an illusion' and he suggested that a combination of mechanical and biologic factors would help to overcome the problem of recurrence.|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of the <b>vascular</b> <b>stent</b> position, {{shape and}} correct {{expansion}} {{has a high}} relevance in therapy and diagnosis. Hence, the wall apposition in vessel areas with differing diameters {{and the appearance of}} torsions or structural defects of the implant body caused by catheter based device dropping are of special interest. Neurovascular implants like braided flow diverter and laser cut stents consist of metal struts and wires with diameters of about 40 µm. Depending on the implants material composition, visibility is poor with conventional 2 D X-ray fluoroscopic and radiographic imaging. The metal structures of the implants also lead to artifacts in 3 D X-ray images and can hamper the assessment of the device position. We investigated intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a new imaging tool for the evaluation of the <b>vascular</b> <b>stent</b> position, its shape and its correct expansion for 3 different vascular implants...|$|R

Following reassuring animal work with self expanding mesh stents in Lausanne Sigwart reported the first human implants of such vascular scaffolds. These <b>vascular</b> <b>stents,</b> implanted in peripheral and coronary circulation, were multi-filament self-expanding, spring-like devices made of surgical steel. Sigwart's work made angioplasty predictable which significantly improved the outcome and offered a chance to overcome the problem of abrupt closure and recurrence.|$|E
50|$|SMPs {{are smart}} {{materials}} with potential applications as, e.g., intravenous cannula, self-adjusting orthodontic wires and selectively pliable tools for small scale surgical procedures where currently metal-based shape-memory alloys such as Nitinol are widely used. Another application of SMP {{in the medical}} field could be its use in implants: for example minimally invasive, through small incisions or natural orifices, implantation of a device in its small temporary shape. Shape-memory technologies have shown great promise for cardiovascular stents, since they allow a small stent to be inserted along a vein or artery and then expanded to prop it open. After activating the shape memory by temperature increase or mechanical stress, it would assume its permanent shape. Certain classes of shape-memory polymers possess an additional property: biodegradability. This offers the option to develop temporary implants. In the case of biodegradable polymers, after the implant has fulfilled its intended use, e.g. healing/tissue regeneration has occurred, the material degrades into substances which can be eliminated by the body. Thus full functionality would be restored without the necessity for a second surgery to remove the implant. Examples of this development are <b>vascular</b> <b>stents</b> and surgical sutures. When used in surgical sutures, the shape-memory property of SMPs enables wound closure with self-adjusting optimal tension, which avoids tissue damage due to overtightened sutures and does support healing and regeneration.|$|E

Additionally, in order to compare obtained results, an experimental analysis of the stent made of stainless steel was carried out. Design/methodology/approach: In {{order to determine the}} strength characteristics of the analyzed stent the finite element method was applied. Geometrical model of the <b>vascular</b> <b>stent,</b> which was meshed {{with the use of the}} SOLID 95 element, was worked out. Selection of the finite element was conditioned by large strains that occur during angioplastic procedure. The established boundary conditions imitated the phenomena during the balloon expansion in real conditions. Findings: The result of the analysis was determination of relationship between equivalent stresses and strains in the individual regions the stent in the function of the diameter’s change (d = 1. 20 - 4. 00 mm) caused by expanding pressure. Analysis of the obtained results indicates diverse distribution of stresses and strains in the stent depending on the applied biomaterial. Research limitations/implications: The obtained results of the biomechanical analysis of the coronary stent are valuable information for correct design of the geometry and mechanical properties of the applied metallic biomaterials. Strain analysis of the stent indicates that in order to limit a surface reactivity of the stent in blood environment, a deformable surface layer must be applied. Originality/value: Results of the numerical analysis indicate that mechanical properties of the metallic biomaterials used to manufacture the analyzed <b>vascular</b> <b>stent</b> were selected correctly. The correctness of the selection (mechanical properties of the metallic biomaterials) should be confirmed in in vitro tests realized with the use of the coronary angioplasty set...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAims: The VALEO ® <b>vascular</b> <b>stent</b> is a {{stainless}} steel, pre-mounted, open-cell stent. Redilation to large diameters and low profile are advantages in growing children. Clinical experience is scarce. This study aimed to analyse our {{experience with the}} use of the VALEO ® <b>vascular</b> <b>stent</b> in children. Methods and results: Between June 2010 and December 2012, 41 VALEO ® stents were inserted during 30 transcatheter (group 1) and three perioperative procedures (group 2). Data were retrospectively analysed. Median age at implantation was 3. 8 years (four days- 23 years), and median weight was 13. 3 kg (2. 2 - 53 kg). Indications were: pulmonary artery (n= 23), pulmonary vein (n= 1) or subhepatic vein (n= 1) stenosis, and ductus arteriosus stenting (n= 8). Stent placement was achieved in all but one. Acute complications (n= 11) included stent dislodgement in two patients and fracture in three patients, with vessel predilatation as a risk factor. Median " stent " follow-up reached 7. 83 months (0. 4 - 34. 3 months) and included 26 recatheterisations (23 patients, median interval 6. 2 months, range 0. 2 - 33 months). Ten stents were redilated. Surgery in six patients (interval 1. 9 to 10 months) showed patent endothelialised stents. No " late " type II or III stent fractures were seen. Conclusions: The VALEO ® stent is useful in children. Low radial force is counterbalanced by high flexibility, allowing implantation in distal and tortuous lesions. Early fractures occur. Longer-term follow-up is needed.

The effects of structures, deposition temperature, Ti interlayer and thickness on the adhesion of titanium oxide films were investigated by tensile tests.

Therefore its adhesion was worse than that of TiO 2 film. The higher substrate temperature was helpful to improve adhesion of film, the adhesion of the TiO film deposited at 673 K was better than those of the TiO films deposited at 323 K and 473 K. The adhesion of the TiO film with Ti interlayer was better than the one without interlayer. The introduction of Ti interlayer was beneficial to adhesion of film. The adhesion of thinner TiO 2 film was better than that of thicker one. TiO 2 film deposited on stents had good adhesion. After expansion, the film didn’t crack and peel off.
