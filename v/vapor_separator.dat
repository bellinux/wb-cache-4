40|$|Corrosion {{data for}} types 304 L, 309 SCb, and 347 {{stainless}} steel were obtained {{in a number}} of process vessels in the ORNL Thorex pilot plant during the development and the production-development periods of operation occurring between December 1954 and September 1956. Stressed corrosion-test specimens were exposed in the batch dissolver tank, the feed adjustment tank, the BT <b>vapor</b> <b>separator,</b> the A-column feed tuink, and the BTC catch tank Generally, types 304 L and 3 O 9 SCb stainless steel exhibited comparable corrosion resistance in all environments examined. Most of the studies were conducted with these two alloys. Severe corrosion damage was encountered in the vapor phase of both the batch dissolver twin, operated at a maximum temperature of 115 deg C, and the feed adjustment tank, operated at a maximum temperature of 155 deg C. Corrosion rates for types 304 L and 309 SCb stainless steel varied from approximately 30 to 55 mpy in the batch dissolver tank during the development and the production-development periods. Vapor-phase corrosion rates in the feed adjustment tank during the lant haif of the development period ranged from 85 to 100 mpy. Severe corrosion attack was experienced also in the BT <b>vapor</b> <b>separator,</b> which operated at a maximum temperature of 115 deg C. Rates were 30 to 55 mpy for type 304 L stainless steel, 25 mpy for type 3 O 9 SCb stainless steel, and a maximum rate of 150 mpy for a composite specimen of types 3 O 9 SCb and 347 stainless steel. Solution-phase corrosion rates for types 304 L and 3 O 9 SCb stainless steel in the batch dissolver tank ranged from 13 to 28 mpy, with the lower rates observed on the type 3 O 9 SCb steel. The latter corroded at an average rate of 41 mpy in the feed adjustment tank, however. No data were available for type 304 L stainless steel in the solution phase of this vessel. The corrosion of types 3 O 4 L and H 7 stainless steel was negligible in the A-column feed tank and the BTC catch tank; observed rates were less toan 0. 1 mpy. (auth...|$|E
40|$|Cryosurgery is {{a widely}} {{regarded}} minimally invasive surgery for treatment of various types of cancers. It involves destruction of cancer cells within a limited spatial domain by exposing them to very low temperatures while minimizing injury to surrounding peripheral healthy tissues. Surprisingly, despite increasing demands for cryosurgery, there has been limited innovation {{in the design of}} cryoprobes, particularly in solid tumors (e. g., breast, prostate, and lung cancers). For advances in cancer therapeutics, integrative biology research can illuminate the mechanistic interface between a surgical cryoprobe and its tissue site of action. Here, we describe the design and development of three novel low pressure liquid nitrogen (LN 2) cryoprobes with different physical dimensions and the parameters that determine their effectiveness experimentally, using water and bio-gel as the phase changing mediums. Smaller diameter low pressure probes produced lesser cryogenic injury. <b>Vapor</b> <b>Separator</b> is found to be an effective means (particularly for smaller diameter probes) to remove the vapor lock in the LN 2 low pressure cryoprobes and also to reduce the precooling time. The low pressure LN 2 cryoprobes produced lower probe temperatures and consequently larger and faster iceball growth for low cooling loads. Additionally, a numerical code was written in MATLAB based on the Enthalpy method to simulate the bio-heat transfer in a cryosurgical process. The numerical code is validated by analytical solution, laboratory experiments, and data from an in vivo cryosurgery. The developed numerical code is presented herein to illustrate that LN 2 cryoprobes capable of producing lower probe temperatures produce more efficient cryosurgical operation by reducing the buffer zone and duration of surgery. This is the first report, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, on design of the next generation of LN 2 surgical cryoprobes. These new surgical cryoprobes offer potentials for future preclinical and clinical testing in solid cancers...|$|E
30|$|The reactor {{product stream}} is cooled through a {{condenser}} and fed to a vapor-liquid <b>separator.</b> The <b>vapor</b> exits the <b>separator</b> and recycles to the reactor feed through a compressor. A {{portion of the}} recycle stream is purged to prevent the inert and byproduct from accumulating. The condensed component from the separator is sent to a stripper, {{which is used to}} strip the remaining reactants. After G and H exit the base of the stripper, they are sent to a downstream process which is not included in the diagram. The inert and byproducts are finally purged as <b>vapor</b> from vapor-liquid <b>separator.</b>|$|R
40|$|Building heating {{requirements}} {{increase with}} decreasing ambient temperature, while {{the coefficient of}} performance of air-source heat pumps (ASHPs) shows the opposite trend. Additionally, heat pump heating capacity decreases with ambient temperature, {{which leads to the}} utilization of inefficient electric auxiliary heat below the design point. Increasing the capacity and coefficient of performance (COP) at lower ambient temperatures is important for improving the market penetration of heat pumps in climates having significant operating time at low ambient temperature. Simulation studies previously showed that compressor vapor injection leads to an increase of COP under exactly those conditions. Furthermore, reduced capacity degradation towards smaller ambient temperatures was predicted. The work presented in this paper shows experimental results obtained from a commercially available 5 -ton heat pump that was retrofitted with a two-port vapor injected scroll compressor. The injection ports within the two compression pathways are located in the fixed scroll with different distance from the suction chamber. The vapor for the two injection pressure levels was generated using two <b>vapor</b> <b>separators</b> in a cascade configuration. This configuration made it necessary to not only control the superheat but also the liquid levels in the separators and subcooling of the refrigerant leaving the condenser...|$|R

Additionally, heating capacity decreases with ambient temperature, {{which leads to the}} utilization of inefficient electric reheat below the design point. Increasing the capacity and COP at lower ambient temperatures is important for improving the market penetration of heat pumps in climates having significant operating time at low ambient temperature. Simulation studies previously showed that compressor vapor injection leads to an increase of COP under exactly those conditions. Furthermore, reduced capacity degradation towards smaller ambient temperatures was predicted. The work presented in this paper shows experimental results obtained from a commercially available 5 -ton heat pump that was retrofitted with a two-port vapor injected scroll compressor. The injection ports within the two compression pathways are located in the fixed scroll with different distance from the suction chamber. The vapor for the two injection pressure levels was generated using two <b>vapor</b> <b>separators</b> in a cascade configuration. This configuration made it necessary to not only control the superheat but also the liquid levels in the separators and subcooling of the refrigerant leaving the condenser. Baseline performance data of the heat pump without vapor injection was obtained and compared with that for the vapor injection and other system configurations. For the baseline, the injection lines to the compression pockets were plugged within the fixed scroll to reduce dead volume and re-expansion losses. Also, the vapor-separator section was shut off and bypassed. In the second step, the plugs were removed and a staged expansion process was performed using the separator section. The generated <b>vapor</b> from each <b>separator</b> was injected into the respective compressor port causing an intercooling effect on the compression process. With identical compressor speed, a 28 % improvement in capacity was achieved at the 8. 33 °C (47 F) design point, when compared to the baseline without vapor injection. When the baseline and vapor injected system capacity were matched by adjusting compressor speed, the COP increased by up to 6 % at - 8. 33 °C (17 F). Preliminary results of a bin-type analysis of the experimental data predicts an improvement in HSPF of 6 % for Minneapolis and nearly 7 % for AHRI climate region 5. The benefit is mainly caused by a reduction of the auxiliary electric heater’s runtime...|$|R
40|$|The {{turbulent}} {{transport mode}} of <b>vapor</b> liquid phase <b>separators</b> (VLPS) for He II {{has been investigated}} comparing passive porous plug separators with active phase separators (APS) using slits of variable flow paths within a common frame of reference. It is concluded that the basic transport regimes in both devices are identical. An integrated Gorter-Mellink (1949) equation, found previously to predict VLPS results of porous plugs, is employed to analyze APS data published in the literature. It is found that the Gorter-Mellink flow rate parameter for 9 -micron and 14 -micron APS slit widths are relatively independent of the slit width, having a rate constant of about 9 + or - 10 percent. This agrees with the early heat flow results for He II entropy transport at zero net mass flow in wide capillaries and slits...|$|R
40|$|Binary {{fluid system}} has an {{efficient}} system of heat recovery {{compared to a}} single fluid system due to a better temperature match between hot and cold fluids. There are many applications with binary fluid system i. e. Kalina power generation, vapor absorption refrigeration, combined power and cooling etc. Due to involvement of three properties (pressure, temperature and concentration) in the processes evaluation, the solution is complicated compared to a pure substance. The current work simplifies this complex nature of solution and analyzes the basic processes to understand the processes behavior in power generation as well as cooling plants. Kalina power plant consists of regenerator, heat recovery vapor generator, condenser, mixture, separator, turbine, pump and throttling device. In addition {{to some of these}} components, the cooling plant consists of absorber which is similar in operation of condenser.

40|$|A liquid/gas phase {{separator}} {{has been}} developed which separates both liquid He-I and He-II from their <b>vapor.</b> The phase <b>separator</b> was designed for the Superfluid Helium On Orbit Transfer (SHOOT) Flight Demonstration both to cool the liquid He after launch (at temperatures between 2. 8 and 4. 3 K) to the operating temperature of 1. 4 K and as a low rate vent on orbit to maintain operating temperature. The phase separator is made of high-purity copper disks held apart by 6 micron Kevlar fibers. It works {{on the principle of}} conducting heat from within the dewar to vaporize liquid as it is throttled in the slits to efficiently cool the remaining liquid. Laboratory tests have demonstrated perfect phase separation for both He at its saturated vapor pressure from 1. 2 to 4. 3 K and for He-II at 2. 13 K at pressures from 4. 6 to 112 kPa. The performance of this phase separator during lab testing as well as expected performance in space is discussed...|$|R
40|$|STEAM QUALITY {{has been}} {{generally}} {{defined as the}} amount of moisture/vapor (or lack thereof) contained within steam produced from some form of boiler. It has long been used as the standard term for the measurement of ""wet or dry"" steam and as a means of measuring enthalpy. Totally dry steam is said to be ""saturated"" steam. It is sometimes defined as the ""dryness faction"". The term in its historical denotation refers to a physical attribute of the steam. That attribute being ""what is the percentage water vapor content of the steam"" as compared to the amount of steam. Dry saturated steam is steam which carries no water vapor with it and is defined as having a quality of 1. 00 (100 %). Since water vapor is always present at the interface between the water level and the steam in a boiler, some water vapor will always tend to pass through the system with the steam. Hence, a continuing problem. If steam does carry water <b>vapor</b> past the <b>separators</b> it will tend to coalesce as a liquid, and in doing so it also will carry boiler chemicals with it. ...|$|R
