5|$|Ideological and {{political}} rivals for centuries, Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism deeply influenced one another. For example, Wang Bi, {{one of the}} most influential philosophical commentators on Laozi (and Yijing), was a Confucian. The three rivals also share some similar <b>values,</b> <b>with</b> all three embracing a humanist philosophy emphasizing moral behavior and human perfection. In time, most Chinese people identified to some extent with all three traditions simultaneously. This became institutionalised when aspects of the three schools were synthesised in the Neo-Confucian school.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the Somali studies scholar Charles Geshekter {{produced}} The Parching Winds of Somalia. Shot {{on location}} in Somalia, the film examines how the country's nomadic inhabitants managed to withstand the ravages of a harsh desert environment and the encroachment of imperial forces by synthesizing knowledge of the past, Muslim practices, and skillful livestock management in a successful fusion of traditional <b>values</b> <b>with</b> modern techniques.|$|E

5|$|According to {{professor}} Nalini Natarajan of the University of Puerto Rico, Nargis's Mother India is a metonymic {{representation of a}} Hindu woman, reflecting high Hindu <b>values,</b> <b>with</b> virtuous morality and motherly self-sacrifice. Film scholar Jyotika Virdi wrote that Mother India could {{also be seen as}} a metaphor of the trinity of mother, God, and a dynamic nation. Vijay Mishra, in his 2002 book Bollywood Cinema: Temples of Desire, opined that the Mother India figure is an icon in several respects—being associated with a goddess, her function as a wife, as a lover, and even compromising her femininity {{at the end of the}} film by playing the role of Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the Destroyer, masculine gods.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} era, the UK {{produced}} derivatives {{of the design}} based on the T-1, {{as opposed to the}} original Mk. XIV. These T-2 and T-4 (Blue Devil) designs had much higher altitude, airspeed and wind-speed settings, suitable for high-altitude bombing in the jet stream. These were normally part of the Navigation and Bombing System, which combined inputs from aircraft instruments, H2S and Green Satin radars, star fixes and radio navigation systems, in a mechanical computer that directly output the latitude and longitude of the aircraft, based on automatic dead reckoning. The same outputs were also sent to the sighting head of the T-4, eliminating the need to manually set the windage and providing those <b>values</b> <b>with</b> much higher accuracy (about ±0.1mph and ±0.1 degrees).|$|E
5|$|Morris aided the DF {{using his}} artistic and {{literary}} talents; he designed the group's membership card, and helped author their manifesto, Socialism Made Plain, {{in which they}} demanded improved housing for workers, free compulsory education for all children, free school meals, an eight-hour working day, the abolition of national debt, nationalisation of land, banks, and railways, and the organisation of agriculture and industry under state control and co-operative principles. Some of his DF comrades {{found it difficult to}} reconcile his socialist <b>values</b> <b>with</b> his position as proprietor of the Firm, although he was widely admired as a man of integrity. The DF began publishing a weekly newspaper, Justice, which soon faced financial losses that Morris covered. Morris also regularly contributed articles to the newspaper, in doing so befriending another contributor, George Bernard Shaw.|$|E

For women, PRIs increase from 7.5 to 12.7 mg/day as phytate intake increases from 300 to 1200 mg/day; for men the range is 9.4 to 16.3 mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs.

5|$|Tetra Master is a card-based minigame {{that can}} be {{initiated}} with various non-playable characters in the field. Players assemble a deck of five cards, which can be obtained via chests, given as a reward, or earned from fighting monsters. Each card has various arrows which point to the four sides and {{four corners of the}} card, and various stats that vary between cards, with rarer cards being more powerful. Players take it in turns to strategically place cards on a 4x4 playing grid based on the available directions. Battles can occur when players place a card next to another card, depending on where the player places it. If the defending card has no arrows whilst the attacking card has an arrow pointing towards it, that card is placed under the player's control. When two arrows meet with each other, the cards do battle based on their point <b>values,</b> <b>with</b> the losing card coming under the winning player's control, sometimes triggering combos that put multiple cards in the winner's control. After all cards are played, the winner is the player who has the most cards under their control, with a draw occurring if they have the same number of cards. The winning player may choose a card from their opponent's deck out of the ones they put under their control. If the winning player scores a perfect win however, in which all ten cards are put under their control, they will win all five cards from the opponent's deck.|$|E
