50|$|It {{has been}} suggested, {{even by the}} {{director}} himself, that Green's films {{take a lot of}} influence from the works of fellow Texan Terrence Malick. Malick himself served as an executive producer of Green's 2004 film Undertow. Green has suggested that no other director had used <b>voice-over</b> narration <b>so</b> well, citing Malick's classic 1978 film Days of Heaven as the principal source of inspiration for Undertow.|$|R
5000|$|Bell {{made her}} writing and {{directing}} feature film debut at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival with In a World.... which she {{wrote and directed}} and in which she starred She describes the film as [...] "a comedy about a female voice-over artist and family dysfunction and relationships. I’m obsessed with the <b>voice-over</b> world, <b>so</b> {{it makes sense for}} me." [...] The film was picked up by Roadside Attractions and Sony.|$|R
2500|$|During Patrick's {{last few}} years with Rediffusion, Malaysia was going through an {{advertising}} boom. The government introduced the 'Made in Malaysia' ruling: 65% of the elements in commercials that {{were meant to be}} aired over electronic media must be Malaysian, or Malaysian-made. Hence Patrick was called very often to do <b>voice-over</b> work. <b>So</b> much so that at one point of his career, up to 99% of English advertisements aired over electronic media were voiced by Patrick. Thus he became known as the [...] "Voice of Malaysia".|$|R
5000|$|Welles {{featured}} Othello clips in his 1978 [...] "making of" [...] movie, Filming Othello, {{but in fact}} {{these had}} all been completely re-edited by him for the documentary, and so do {{not appear in the}} original film in the same form. The clips were all accompanied by a <b>voice-over</b> from Welles, <b>so</b> that no part of the original soundtrack was heard in Filming Othello.|$|R
25|$|The {{series was}} created after the airing of a {{one-time}} special called Dogfights: The Greatest Air Battles in September 2005. That program's combination of realistic-looking CGI dogfights, interviews, period documentary footage, and <b>voice-over</b> narration proved <b>so</b> successful, that the History Channel requested {{the production of}} an entire TV series, which became Dogfights. The original special continues to air occasionally and has been recently updated to reflect the current series logo.|$|R
500|$|Some {{critics were}} not as enthusiastic, however. On {{reviewing}} the DVD release of the season, Entertainment Weeklys Dalton Ross gave it a B+ grade, selecting the pilot, [...] "Who's That Woman?", [...] "Guilty", [...] "Children Will Listen" [...] and the season finale [...] "One Wonderful Day" [...] as the season's best episodes, and [...] "Suspicious Minds", [...] "Your Fault" [...] and [...] "Love is in the Air" [...] as the season's worst. Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com felt that after a few episodes, [...] "this dark exploration {{of the lives of}} women has not only slid quickly into clichés, but the acting feels forced and overplayed, the stories are wildly unrealistic, the direction is stuck in some awkward nowhereland between campy and leaden, and the <b>voice-over</b> is <b>so</b> grating and so peskily imitative of Sex and the City that the whole package is almost unwatchable." ...|$|R
5000|$|Upon release, Tropico {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard called the film [...] "a work of overflowing, era-traversing passion" [...] {{and called the}} climax of the film [...] "pure bliss". Under the Gun took issue with the [...] "somewhat nonsensical" [...] narration throughout the film, but said as a whole the film was [...] "certainly something special". Similarly, Jimmy So of The Daily Beast also criticized the film's narration and compared it to [...] "a campy arthouse movie" [...] and described Del Rey's videos to this point as being [...] "starved of creativity". In contrast, James Caterino of Examiner gave the film a 5-star review writing [...] "The imagery is breathtaking and the <b>voice-over</b> narration <b>so</b> jam-packed with poetic prose that it sears into the soul... She is an artistic force who never fails to fascinate—and to make us feel". In a slightly more critical but equally optimistic review, Sal Cinquemani of Slant added [...] "It's obvious from the big bang that opens the film that Del Rey and Mandler have zero interest in subtlety, but interestingly, Del Rey doesn't position herself among the film's icons of Americana the way, say, Kanye West or Lady Gaga might. Instead, her work continues to serve as both a tribute to an imagined past and a critique of contemporary pop culture".|$|R
