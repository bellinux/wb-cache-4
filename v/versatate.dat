Versatate-fluorocarbon {{emulsion}} with {{core-shell structure}} was synthesized by seeded emulsion polymerization using <b>versatate,</b> organic fluorine and acrylate as raw materials. The influences of amount of organic fluorine and <b>versatate,</b> core-shell ratio on {{the properties of}} emulsion were discussed. The emulsion was characterized with contact angle analyzer, particle size, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The {{results showed that the}} emulsion had good properties while w(organic fluorine) = 6 %, w(versatate) = 8 %, soft core-hard shell and w(core) :w(shell) = 3 : 2. The particle size is 110 nm and with core-shell structure. The contact angle of emulsion film to water is 98. 1 ยบ. The synergistic effect of <b>versatate</b> and fluorocarbon based on core-shell structure improve the over-all properties effectively...|$|E

Its efficiency in inhibiting spore germination is one tenth that of copper naphthenate...|$|E
40|$|For the {{investigations}} a catalyst consti-tuted by di-isobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAH), neodymium <b>versatate</b> and t-butyl chloride was used. The {{aim of this}} work is to evaluate {{the effect of the}} catalyst ageing temperature on the molecular polymer characteristics (mi-crostructure and molecular weight) and the catalyst activity. The catalysts were aged at 10, 25 and 40 8 C for 24 h. The polybutadienes were characterized by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to determine the molecular weight distri-bution and by FT-IR to determine the microstructure...|$|E
