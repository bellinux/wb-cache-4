50|$|The 1916 {{station was}} built of brick and {{stone in the}} current Beaux-Arts {{architecture}} style with a <b>vitrified</b> <b>tile</b> waiting room and monumental wooden benches. It served three 12-car-length island platforms with enclosed seating areas situated between three pairs of tracks (main and yard leads). Originally the platform surfaces were level with the floors of the railroad passenger cars, but they were later lowered {{to the level of}} the track, reportedly due to substandard lateral clearances between the platforms and carbodies caused by the tracks' partially curved alignment when lengthier cars came into use; the change further spared train crews the inconvenience of having to lower and raise trap doors over the coach stairwells for this single station alone when platform levels of the other stations on this commuter route were not elevated to match. One of the platforms was removed altogether. Access to the platforms was available by stairways at the Penn Ave., South Ave., and Franklin Ave. underpasses, in addition to the station tunnel which also served as the Ross Ave. pedestrian underpass. There was also a separate tunnel at the station to deliver mail, express, and baggage to the platforms (a U.S. post office was later constructed across the street from the station, forming a sort of civic center in conjunction with the municipal building/public library, also across the street). The station's strategic location visible down Ross Ave. was negated when that street's motor traffic was made one-way in the opposite direction.|$|E

Later, 3 more tiers were added in only two months. The roof consists of colored <b>vitrified</b> <b>tiles,</b> and four turrets were built. The tower had a guard, who would sound his bugle whenever an enemy approached. The tower has in its South-Western corner (between the clocks) a small wooden man who rings a bell, thus announcing in advance when the clock will ring on the hour. The heavy pressure of the tower on the sandy soil is the reason why the tower is slightly tilted to the North. Between 1927 and 1930, and later in 1972, the tower was consolidated. The tilt of the tip compared with the base is 2.32 m.|$|R

40|$|The {{historical}} {{process that}} {{led to the development of}} ecclesiastical architecture in Nigeria relied on a number of factors and industrial revolution one of these factors. This study examined the effect of industrial revolution on ecclesiastical architecture in Nigeria with a view to identifying the new technologies and materials that were employed. Faith Tabernacle at Ota became one of the best cases to study because it was acclaimed the largest church auditorium by the Guinness Book of World Records in January 2008 and arguably one of the ecclesiastical engineering wonders of the age in twentieth century. Since the study was historical in nature, qualitative methods in form of literature, non-participant method in case study and unstructured interview were employed in gathering the data and content analysis with descriptions were used in analysis. The findings showed that the need for unobstructed viewing spaces, quest for its own time, globalization and new theology with liturgy warranted the desire to embrace industrial revolution. New technologies like framed structures, use of machinery and new construction methods emerged. New materials like concrete, timber, steel sections for columns and beams, different forms of glass, <b>vitrified</b> <b>tiles</b> and aluminium were introduced. The study concluded that ecclesiastical architecture in Nigeria has had its own fair share of the effect of industrial revolution...|$|R

40|$|AB STRACT: An attempt {{has been}} made to assess new {{potential}} applications for the Bailén clays, traditionally used for manufacturing bricks, based on mineralogical, chemical, particle size, plasticity and firing results. Raw materials and mixtures used by the local factory were selected and tested with the addition of some diatomite, feldspar or kaolin. Based on their properties, clay materials from Bailén might be suitable for making porous red wall <b>tiles,</b> clinker, <b>vitrified</b> red floor <b>tiles</b> and porous light-coloured wall tiles by pressing; the first could be manufactured from the raw materials and mixtures currently used by the local manufactures. On the other hand, stoneware shaped by extrusion, such as perforated bricks, facing bricks and roofing tiles, can be also manufactured from the mixtures used at the factory if they contain 20 25 % carbonate and small amounts of iron oxides; lightweight bricks require black and yellow clays with diatomite. Tertiary clays from the Bailén area (southern Spain) have traditionally been used for manufacturing bricks and other ceramic building materials (González et al., 1985, 1992). Except for some specific clays, the Bailén reserves appear to be virtually unlimited. More than 90 % of the industrial products obtained from these clays are perforated bricks and only two factories manufacture higher grade products such as clinker facing bricks and roofing tiles. Production in the area amounts to nearly two million pieces per day. The purpose of this work was: (a) the investiga-tion of new potential uses for these raw materials {{on the basis of their}} mineralogical, chemical, drying and forming properties; and (b) the preparation of mixtures with other minerals and rocks (e. g. kaolin, feldspar, diatomite) in order to make higher-grade products...|$|R
