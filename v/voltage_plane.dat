40|$|A power {{distribution}} network (PDN) {{is designed to}} provide clean power and facilitate high signal integrity in modern electronic systems. However, the design of a good PDN has faced challenges due to increased number of voltage rails in a design, stringent low noise requirement, and increased electromagnetic coupling and crosstalk among different parts of the circuits. Current power delivery method mostly utilizes <b>voltage</b> and ground <b>plane</b> pairs. This approach; however, suffers from return path discontinuity issues that can lead to signal integrity issues such as worsened simultaneous switching noise and ground bounce.

However, shunt sensing methods are unable to acquire phase currents in certain operation conditions.

As the boundary conditions are deeply dependent on the switching patterns, they are typically analyzed on the <b>voltage</b> vector <b>plane</b> for space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) and discontinuous pulse width modulation (DPWM). In the proposed method, the voltage injection and its compensation are conducted within one sampling period. This guarantees fast current reconstruction and the injected voltage is decided so as to minimize the current ripple. In addition to the voltage injection method, a sampling point shifting method is also introduced to improve the boundary conditions.

Another intriguing phenomenon, planar Hall effect - appearance of a transverse <b>voltage</b> in the <b>plane</b> of applied co-planar electric and magnetic fields not perfectly aligned to each other, a configuration in which the conventional Hall effect vanishes, has recently been suggested to exist in Weyl semimetals.

Starting from Boltzmann transport equations we derive the expressions for planar Hall conductivity and longitudinal magnetoconductivity in topological insulators and show the important roles played by the orbital magnetic moment for the appearance of planar Hall effect. Our theoretical results predict specific experimental signatures for topological insulators that can be directly checked in experiments. Comment: 18 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|Permanent magnet {{synchronous}} motors (PMSMs) are replacing induction motors {{because of}} their better performance in industrial applications. Due to the availability of fast DSP processors now-a-days complex control algorithms can be implemented efficiently. In conventional-drive circuits the six-switch inverter ruled {{for a long time}} because of the ease of its control; however, a four-switch inverter provides the cost effective efficient replacement. The dynamic model of a machine provides an insight into the dynamics of its operation and control. A PMSM has been modeled in Matlab Simulink in different frames of references and the model has been validated under different operating conditions. The space-vector algorithm of a sixswitch three-phase inverter has been modified for the control of a four-switch three-phase inverter (FSTPI) by establishing the symmetry between the <b>voltage</b> space-vector <b>planes</b> of both inverters. A FSTPI exhibits the current-unbalancing problem because of the unbalanced voltage distribution across the capacitor. The current-unbalancing issue has been resolved by introducing a â€˜duty waveform driftâ€™ method. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used to optimize the performance of a four-switch inverter. The detailed modeling of the space-vector technique for both the conventional and four-switch inverters has been presented. A PWM rectifier has been implemented using sinusoidal pulse width modulation and space vector pulse modulation to ensure that the drive maintains unity input power factor. A modified optimized space-vector algorithm, used for the inverter operation, has been introduced in the control of PWM rectifiers to ensure the best computational performance. There exist a number of control techniques for a PMSM: direct-torque control (DTC) and fieldoriented control (FOC) have been investigated in detail for the proposed four-switch inverter.
