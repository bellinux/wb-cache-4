40|$|In {{this project}} two pump mode tests {{has been carried}} out on a model RPT in the Waterpower Laboratory at NTNU. The {{measurement}} set up and execution of the tests were the same, except for the method of dissipating energy in the system. In the first test one of the feed pumps in the basement was used as energy dissipator. In the second test a throttle valve was used as energy dissipator. The objective has been to see how the Waterpower Laboratory is suited for such a test. It was also important to test the two different dissipation methods and evaluate which should be preferred when performing a pump mode test. During the tests it was observed that the guide vane angle kept changing. When the results were processed it became evident that the variations in guide vane angle during the tests had a big influence on the measured pump curves. Variations in guide vane angle has not previously been observed during turbine mode testing. It is presumed that the variation in guide vane angles is due to play in the guide <b>vane</b> <b>system</b> and the design of the guide vanes. The guide vanes are Francis vanes, and not RPT vanes. It is assumed that it is the sharp trailing edge of the guide vanes that causes turbulence over the vanes in pump mode, thus making the guide vanes move about within the play of the guide <b>vane</b> <b>system.</b> It is suggested that the guide <b>vane</b> <b>system</b> is replaced with an RPT guide <b>vane</b> <b>system</b> for further testing in pump mode. The two dissipation methods tested were both effective. The throttle valve works best for achieving 0 flow, while the feed pump is easier to regulate. None of the methods showed signs of high noise or vibrations, and both may be used for future tests. </p...|$|E
40|$|With reduced {{turbo lag}} and better {{transient}} response, {{the introduction of}} VTG stator guide vanes improved turbocharger performance at all the engine operating conditions. The VTG system accelerates and maneuvers exhaust gas flow to the turbine. Favorable flow conditions at turbine inlet created by vane shape improve turbine performance. At lower engine speed, {{it is observed that}} the pressure drop across <b>vane</b> <b>system</b> influences overall efficiency. Whereas at higher speed, the pressure drop and guide vane exit flow angle are found to determine the turbine efficiency. Successful practical operation of VTG system also depends on its ability to smoothly open and close the vanes at different gas loads. Stator vane shape greatly influences the smooth operability/controllability of <b>vane</b> <b>system.</b> In the present work, 3 symmetric vanes with different T/C ratios and 2 asymmetric vanes are analyzed. The effect of geometric changes is studied from overall turbine performance as well as VTG system performance perspective. It is observed that symmetric vanes cause higher pressure drop at lower speeds leading to lower efficiency irrespective of the vane width. It is also observed that the pressure drop characteristics and vane exit flow angle are better with the asymmetric vanes, whereas the controllability of symmetric vanes is found to be superior. Analysis methodology is presented for achieving the best compromise between performance and controllability by the modification of vane geometric parameters through CFD simulations...|$|E

This method approximates dynamic lift and drag by linearly perturbing the appropriate steady state force equations, assuming that the dynamic loads are due only to free stream turbulence and that this turbulence is homogeneous, isotropic, and Gaussian. Correlation and unsteady aerodynamic effects are also incorporated into the analytical model. Using these assumptions, equations relating dynamic lift and drag to flow turbulence, mean velocity, and vane set geometry are derived. From these equations, estimates for the power spectra and rms (root mean squared value, delta) loading of both lift and drag can be determined...|$|R

An experimental investigation has been conducted by implanting such faults into an operating gas turbine.

It is observed that the deviations of the health indices produced by an adaptive performance model form patterns {{that can be used to}} identify the faults. The patterns characterize both the kind and the magnitude of the fault.

Two surveys were conducted in the spring of 1986 in which data were taken of depths and velocities throughout the bend and of water-surface slope.

40|$|Following {{a review}} of {{previous}} research on wave power conversion, {{it is evident that}} Oscillating Water Columns {{are one of the few}} devices to successfully convert wave power to electrical power at a commercial stage. Furthermore, it is evident that the impulse turbine is a key component in this conversion process and the aim of this research is to improve its performance by designing and implementing an internally housed variable-pitch controlled guide <b>vane</b> <b>system.</b> A validated 3 -D CFD technique was used to analyse the performance of varying nozzle and diffuser guide vane setting angles under steady flow conditions at 0. 5 and 0. 6 hub-to-tip ratios. 0. 5 H/T recorded peak performance at 15 ⁰ nozzle and 82. 5 ⁰ diffuser angles while 0. 6 H/T recorded 15 ⁰ nozzle and 72. 5 ⁰ diffuser angles. It was observed that turbine performance was more sensitive to variation in nozzle than diffuser angle, as both torque and pressure loss were affected by the nozzle. Concurrent research by Walsh (2011) required investigation on the effect of a spherical hub and casing design on turbine performance using 3 -D CFD, designs also implemented in this research. Results showed a reduction in peak efficiency of 1. 1 percentage points at 0. 5 H/T while 0. 6 H/T was reduced by 0. 13 percentage points. Flow visualisation confirmed that this reduction in performance was caused by an area of stagnation in the hub which increased pressure loss. A 2 nd generation, internally housed variable-pitch controlled guide <b>vane</b> <b>system</b> was designed and tested to validate the potential performance improvements outlined in the CFD studies. A number of concepts were evaluated before an iterative design procedure was used to develop the selected concept. The system increased efficiency from 42. 82 % with fixed guide vanes to 56. 56 % under real sea, “Site 2 ” conditions while mechanical shaft power was increased from 97. 8 W to 200. 6 W. Steady flow testing confirmed nozzle angles of between 15 ⁰ and 17. 5 ⁰ produced optimum performance although peak efficiency of 64. 2 % was recorded at 17. 5 ⁰. Optimum diffuser angle of 72. 5 ⁰ was identified. 0. 6 H/T experimental analysis by Walsh (2011) identified optimum angles of 15 ⁰ nozzle and 78 ⁰ diffuser, validating the CFD steady flow analysis. Scaling of model test results to full scale prototype was also investigated and two methodologies were identified, the Froude and polynomial scaling methods. These were successfully used to scale bi-directional model results to varying fullscale diameters and produce turbine design charts. Little variation between methods was noted with the exception of the inclusion of turbulent scatter using the Froude method. A CFD methodology was defined and validated through experimentation to successfully simulate bi-directional flow in turbomachinery problems, modernising and improving the accuracy of CFD analysis. This method used a sliding mesh with rescaled guide vane zone and produced performance trends similar to experimental for a fixed 30 ⁰ guide <b>vane</b> <b>system.</b> At 0. 5 H/T peak efficiency of 44. 35 % was computed compared to 43. 14 % experimental, while at 0. 6 H/T 45. 52 % was computed and 45. 3 % was recorded experimentally. The mixing plane method computed only unidirectional results and these were not in good agreement with experimental data. IR...|$|E
