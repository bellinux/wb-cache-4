30|$|Transparent {{conducting}} oxide (TCO) plays {{a significant}} role in transparent devices, such as solar cell panels, flat panel displays, and organic light-emitting diodes [1]. So far, indium tin oxide (ITO) is a typical commercial TCO. It yields a low resistivity of 10 − 4 Ω[*]·[*]cm, has a transmittance higher than 85 %, and possesses good etch-ability [2]. However, the scarce and toxic nature of indium and instability of ITO have stimulated researchers to explore alternative TCO materials for ITO [3, 4]. ZnO is a wide bandgap semiconductor, which has potential applications in the fields of ultraviolet light emitters, photosensitizers, optoelectronics, gas sensors, etc. [5]. In recent years, ZnO films doped with group-III elements have attracted considerable attention as a candidate for TCO [6 - 13]. Among them, Al-doped ZnO {{is one of the most}} prospective alternative candidates for TCO since Al is abundant and nontoxic [4]. Various methods such as spray pyrolysis [9], atomic layer deposition (ALD) [10], magnetron sputtering [11], chemical vapor deposition [12], and pulsed laser deposition [13] have been adopted to deposit Al-doped ZnO films. The qualities of the films are sensitive to growth techniques and parameters. Compared with other techniques, ALD could deposit uniform and conformal film on large areas at low growth temperature. In addition, the thickness of the film could be controlled accurately. Effects of ALD process parameters such as growth temperature, purge length, and the precursor expose time on the properties of Al-doped ZnO films have been reported [10, 14 - 18]. However, there are seldom reports on thermal stability and property evolution of Al-doped ZnO films grown by ALD after post annealing. Post annealing and the annealing atmospheres are crucial for the film properties [19 - 21]. Kim et al. [19] observed an increase of carrier concentration in Al-doped ZnO films grown by magnetron sputtering after annealing in <b>vacuum.</b> <b>Lin</b> et al. [20] observed a decrease in carrier concentration of heavily Al-doped ZnO films grown by similar method after annealing in N 2 and O 2 atmosphere. Zhou et al. [21] observed an improvement of conductivity of Al-doped ZnO films grown by magnetron sputtering after annealing in a mixture of N 2 and O 2. The results of different groups are controversial, and the related mechanisms are still unclear. Furthermore, ZnO films grown by different methods would show different property evolution when they are annealed under the same conditions. The stability of Al-doped ZnO films is also important for the technology of electronic and optoelectronic devices. It needs to be investigated further.|$|E
30|$|Several workers {{reported}} the electrical and optical properties of PbSe {{in bulk form}} [14 – 17]. Many studies on PbSe films synthesized by chemical techniques {{are available in the}} literature [18 – 22]. There are also few reports on PbSe films and PbSe nanostructured thin films deposited by thermal evaporation technique [23 – 26]. Ma et al. [27] deposited polycrystalline PbSe thin films on Si substrates by thermal reduction method with carbon as the reducing agent. Kumar et al. [28] have studied the electrical, optical, and structural properties of PbSe 1 −xTex thin films prepared by <b>vacuum</b> evaporation technique. <b>Lin</b> et al. [29] {{reported the}} fabrication and characterization of IV-VI semiconductor Pb 1 −xSnxSe thin films on gold substrate by electrochemical atomic layer deposition method at room temperature. Pei et al. [30] studied the electrical and thermal transport properties of lead-based chalcogenides (PbTe, PbSe, and PbS) with special emphasis on the lattice and the bipolar thermal conductivity. Gad et al. [31] have studied the optical and photoconductive properties of Pb 0.9 Sn 0.1 Se nanostructured thin films deposited by thermal vacuum evaporation and pulse laser technique.|$|R
