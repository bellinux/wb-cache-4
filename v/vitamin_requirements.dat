40|$|Stanley R. Ames, 4 Ph. D. ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} amount of d. a-tocopheryl acetate needed for successful reproduction in rats at various ages, of different parities, and at several levels of vtiamin A supplementation. The median fertility dose was determined by using the resorption-gestation bioassay of Mason and Harris. Neither the number of previous pregnancies nor level of vitamin A supplementation (80, 4, 000, and 20, 000 IU/lOO g of diet) had a significant effect on the <b>vitamin</b> E <b>requirement.</b> The <b>vitamin</b> E <b>requirement</b> increased markedly with age. The <b>vitamin</b> E <b>requirement</b> for rats 9 to I I weeks old was set as the standard. The requirement for rats 43 to 45 weeks old was 11 times the standard, and that for rats 59 weeks old was 67 times the standard. The <b>vitamin</b> E <b>requirement</b> for prevention of erythrocyte hemolysis (a measure of absorption) in rats 71 to 72 weeks old was three times that for rats 9 to 11 weeks old. Therefore, the large increases in the <b>vitamin</b> E <b>requirement</b> of rats of increasing age were not due to decreased absorption in the older rats. It is concluded that the <b>vitamin</b> E <b>requirement</b> for reproduction in the rat increases markedly with an increase in age but is not affected by different parities or by vitamin A supplementation.

5000|$|Additives are low-inclusion {{ingredients}} used {{to provide}} essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, antioxidants as well as anti-inflammatory and preservative factors. These are all important aspects in a high performance sporting dog diet. Vitamins and minerals are essential {{for all types of}} dogs and the inclusion rate of them is dependent on factors such as age, size, activity level, etc.19 Not meeting an animal's mineral and <b>vitamin</b> <b>requirements</b> can impact the level of performance tremendously.19 However, too high of a concentration of vitamins and minerals will increase the concentration of ash in the feed. Currently, it is stated that dog foods containing above 7% ash content may have long-term negative consequences on canines.1 Antioxidants such as vitamin E, beta carotene, rosemary oil, sage oil and lutein have been demonstrated in numerous studies to decrease immune response DNA damage linked to cancer, cataracts and arthritis by attaching to free radicals.23 This is important to consider with high performance sporting dogs due to the athlete's high prevalence of developing arthritis later in life. Various antioxidants will be used by the sporting dog to preserve animal and vegetable fats, vitamins and other ingredients prone to rancidity caused by oxidation, all of which are found in relatively high concentrations in performance canine diets.27As a preventative of arthritis, other additives may be included in the diet. These include glucosamine, chondroitine sulphate and omega-3 fatty acids, such as EPA and DHA from fish oil.14,27 These factors have been shown to limit the development of chronic swelling and decrease existing inflammation caused by arthritis, which is essential in the high performance sporting dog.14,19 ...|$|E

40|$|Vitamin E (?-tocopherol) is {{recognised}} {{as a key}} essential lipophilic antioxidant {{in humans}} protecting lipoproteins, PUFA, cellular and intra-cellular membranes from damage. The aim of this review was to evaluate the relevant published data about <b>vitamin</b> E <b>requirements</b> in relation to dietary PUFA intake. Evidence in animals and humans indicates a minimal basal requirement of 4 – 5 mg/d of RRR-?-tocopherol when the diet is very low in PUFA. The <b>vitamin</b> E <b>requirement</b> will increase {{with an increase in}} PUFA consumption and with the degree of unsaturation of the PUFA in the diet. The <b>vitamin</b> E <b>requirement</b> related to dietary linoleic acid, which is globally the major dietary PUFA in humans, was calculated to be 0 · 4 – 0 · 6 mg of RRR-?-tocopherol/g of linoleic acid. Animal studies show that for fatty acids with a higher degree of unsaturation, the <b>vitamin</b> E <b>requirement</b> increases almost linearly with the degree of unsaturation of the PUFA in the relative ratios of 0 · 3, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexaenoic fatty acids, respectively. Assuming a typical intake of dietary PUFA, a <b>vitamin</b> E <b>requirement</b> ranging from 12 to 20 mg of RRR-?-tocopherol/d can be calculated. A number of guidelines recommend to increase PUFA intake as they have well-established health benefits. It will be prudent to assure an adequate vitamin E intake to match the increased PUFA intake, especially as vitamin E intake is already below recommendations in many populations worldwide...|$|R

40|$|The {{endocrine}} {{physiology of}} vitamin D in cattle has been rigorously investigated and has yielded information on <b>vitamin</b> D <b>requirements,</b> endocrine function {{in health and}} disease, general metabolism, and maintenance of calcium homeostasis in cattle. These results are relevant to human vitamin D endocrinology. The current debate regarding <b>vitamin</b> D <b>requirements</b> is centered on the requirements for proper intracrine and paracrine vitamin D signaling. Studies in adult and young cattle can provide valuable insight for understanding <b>vitamin</b> D <b>requirements</b> {{as they relate to}} innate and adaptive immune responses during infectious disease. In cattle, toll-like receptor recognition activates intracrine and paracrine vitamin D signaling mechanism in the immune system that regulates innate and adaptive immune responses in the presence of adequate 25 -hydroxyvitamin D. Furthermore, experiments with mastitis in dairy cattle have provided in vivo evidence for the intracrine vitamin D signaling mechanism in macrophages as well as vitamin D mediated suppression of infection. Epidemiological evidence indicates that circulating concentrations above 32  ng/mL of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D are necessary for optimal vitamin D signaling in the immune system, but experimental evidence is lacking for that value. Experiments in cattle can provide that evidence as circulating 25 -hydroxyvitamin D concentrations can be experimentally manipulated within ranges that are normal for humans and cattle. Additionally, young and adult cattle can be experimentally infected with bacteria and viruses associated with significant diseases in both cattle and humans. Utilizing the bovine model to further delineate the immunomodulatory role of vitamin D will provide potentially valuable insights into the <b>vitamin</b> D <b>requirements</b> of both humans and cattle, especially as they relate to immune response capacity and infectious disease resistance...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Geobacter {{species in}} a phylogenetic cluster known as {{subsurface}} clade 1 {{are often the}} predominant microorganisms in subsurface environments in which Fe(III) reduction is the primary electron-accepting process. Geobacter bemidjiensis, {{a member of this}} clade, was isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated subsurface sediments in Bemidji, Minnesota, and is closely related to Geobacter species found to be abundant at other subsurface sites. This study examines whether there are significant differences in the metabolism and physiology of G. bemidjiensis compared to non-subsurface Geobacter species. RESULTS: Annotation of the genome sequence of G. bemidjiensis indicates several differences in metabolism compared to previously sequenced non-subsurface Geobacteraceae, which will be useful for in silico metabolic modeling of subsurface bioremediation processes involving Geobacter species. Pathways can now be predicted for the use of various carbon sources such as propionate by G. bemidjiensis. Additional metabolic capabilities such as carbon dioxide fixation and growth on glucose were predicted from the genome annotation. The presence of different dicarboxylic acid transporters and two oxaloacetate decarboxylases in G. bemidjiensis may explain its ability to grow by disproportionation of fumarate. Although benzoate is the only aromatic compound that G. bemidjiensis is known or predicted to utilize as an electron donor and carbon source, the genome suggests that this species may be able to detoxify other aromatic pollutants without degrading them. Furthermore, G. bemidjiensis is auxotrophic for 4 -aminobenzoate, which makes it the first Geobacter species identified as having a <b>vitamin</b> <b>requirement.</b> Several features of the genome indicated that G. bemidjiensis has enhanced abilities to respire, detoxify and avoid oxygen. CONCLUSION: Overall, the genome sequence of G. bemidjiensis offers surprising insights into the metabolism and physiology of Geobacteraceae in subsurface environments, compared to non-subsurface Geobacter species, such as the ability to disproportionate fumarate, more efficient oxidation of propionate, enhanced responses to oxygen stress, and dependence on the environment for a <b>vitamin</b> <b>requirement.</b> Therefore, an understanding of the activity of Geobacter species in the subsurface is more likely to benefit from studies of subsurface isolates such as G. bemidjiensis than from the non-subsurface model species studied so far...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{frequency}} of consumption of six dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), their vitamin A values, {{and the relative}} contribution of these vegetables to <b>vitamin</b> A <b>requirement</b> of pregnant women in Calabar urban was assessed. A total of 101 pregnant women attending clinic at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH), Calabar were covered. Using a food-frequency questionnaire, the consumption pattern of the DGLV was assessed. The study revealed that 100 % of the women used the six leafy vegetables chiefly in form of soups and pottages. Ikong ubong (Telfairia occidentalis), Mon-mon ikong (Talinum triangulare) and Afang (Gnetum africanum) were extensively consumed by the women with slight variation in their patterns of consumption, while Inyang afia (Amaranthus hybridus), Atama (Heinsia crinita) and Editan (Lasianthera africana) were less frequently consumed. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed the following values of vitamin A in µg RE/ 100 g for the vegetables: Ikong ubong 860 ± 0. 10, Mon-mon ikong 39 ± 0. 04, Inyang afia 853 ± 0. 19, Afang 44 ± 0. 18, Atama 26 ± 0. 04 and Editan 36 ± 0. 04. Also, Ikong soup with a vitamin A value of 4759. 75 ± 672 µg RE/ 100 g per portion size (200 g) made the highest contribution (255 %) to the <b>vitamin</b> A <b>requirement</b> of the pregnant women, while Atama as Abak (Elaeis guinensis pulp puree) soup (portion size: 150 g) with a vitamin A value of 214. 33 ± 46 µg RE/ 100 g made the least contribution (12 %) to <b>vitamin</b> A <b>requirement</b> in the women.
