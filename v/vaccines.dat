5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of convincing {{evidence}} of toxicity of thiomersal when used as a vaccine preservative, the USPHS and AAP determined that thiomersal should be removed from <b>vaccines</b> as a purely precautionary measure. This action {{was based on the}} precautionary principle, which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unnecessary. The CDC and AAP reasoned that despite {{the lack of}} evidence of significant harm in the use of thiomersal in <b>vaccines,</b> the removal of this preservative would increase the public confidence in the safety of <b>vaccines.</b> Although thiomersal was largely removed from routine infant <b>vaccines</b> by summer 2001 in the U.S., some <b>vaccines</b> continue to contain non-trace amounts of thiomersal, mainly in multi-dose <b>vaccines</b> targeted against influenza and tetanus.|$|E

5|$|Polio <b>vaccines</b> are <b>vaccines</b> used {{to prevent}} {{poliomyelitis}} (polio). There are two types: one that uses inactivated poliovirus and is given by injection (IPV), and one that uses weakened poliovirus and is given by mouth (OPV). The World Health Organization recommends all children be fully vaccinated against polio.

5|$|Thiomersal (also spelled thimerosal, {{especially}} in the United States) is an organomercury compound used as a preservative in <b>vaccines</b> since the 1930s to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination. Following a mandated review of mercury-containing food and drugs in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) asked vaccine makers to remove thiomersal from <b>vaccines</b> {{as quickly as possible}} as a precautionary measure, and it was rapidly phased out of most U.S. and European <b>vaccines.</b> It is still used in all multi-dose vials of flu <b>vaccines</b> in the U.S. In the context of perceived increased autism rates and increased number of <b>vaccines</b> in the childhood vaccination schedule, some parents believed the action to remove thiomersal was an indication that the preservative caused autism.|$|E
5|$|Vaccination is a {{cheap and}} {{effective}} way of preventing infections by viruses. <b>Vaccines</b> were used to prevent viral infections long before {{the discovery of the}} actual viruses. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) associated with viral infections such as polio, measles, mumps and rubella. Smallpox infections have been eradicated. <b>Vaccines</b> are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans, and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals. <b>Vaccines</b> can consist of live-attenuated or killed viruses, or viral proteins (antigens). Live <b>vaccines</b> contain weakened forms of the virus, which do not cause the disease but, nonetheless, confer immunity. Such viruses are called attenuated. Live <b>vaccines</b> can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity (who are described as immunocompromised), because in these people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease. Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit <b>vaccines.</b> These <b>vaccines</b> use only the capsid proteins of the virus. Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine. Subunit <b>vaccines</b> are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease. The yellow fever virus vaccine, a live-attenuated strain called 17D, is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{potential}} <b>vaccines</b> are currently being tested. Vaccination with Trypanosoma rangeli has produced positive results in animal models.

MethodsA provincial survey, including children in the community and newborns in hospital, was conducted to evaluate coverage with a timely first dose of HB <b>vaccine</b> and the completion of three doses of HB <b>vaccine</b> and the NIPV series in 2013. A proportion of the samples was rechecked to investigate the relationship between the administration of a timely first dose of HB <b>vaccine</b> and completion of the HB <b>vaccine</b> series and the NIPV series (three doses of HB <b>vaccine,</b> one dose of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin <b>vaccine,</b> three doses of oral poliomyelitis <b>vaccine,</b> three doses of diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis <b>vaccine,</b> one dose of measles-containing <b>vaccine,</b> one dose of Japanese encephalitis attenuated live <b>vaccine,</b> and two doses of group A meningococcal polysaccharide <b>vaccine).</b> ResultsA total of 6589 subjects (including 3785 community children and 2804 hospital newborns) were included in this study; 97. 34 % of them received a timely first dose of HB <b>vaccine</b> (≤ 24 h after birth) and 99. 10 % and 88. 27 % completed the HB <b>vaccine</b> series and the NIPV series, respectively.

5|$|In 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) {{recommended}} that rotavirus vaccine {{be included in}} all national immunisation programmes. The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have acted on this recommendation. A 2014 review of available clinical trial data from countries routinely using rotavirus <b>vaccines</b> in their national immunisation programs found that rotavirus <b>vaccines</b> have reduced rotavirus hospitalisations by 49-92 percent and all cause diarrhoea hospitalisations by 17-55 percent. In Mexico, which in 2006 {{was among the first}} countries in the world to introduce rotavirus vaccine, diarrhoeal disease death rates dropped during the 2009 rotavirus season by more than 65 percent among children age two and under. In Nicaragua, which in 2006 became the first developing country to introduce a rotavirus vaccine, severe rotavirus infections were reduced by 40 percent and emergency room visits by a half. In the United States, rotavirus vaccination since 2006 has led to drops in rotavirus-related hospitalisations by as much as 86 percent. The <b>vaccines</b> may also have prevented illness in non-vaccinated children by limiting the number of circulating infections. In developing countries in Africa and Asia, where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur, a large number of safety and efficacy trials as well as recent post-introduction impact and effectiveness studies of Rotarix and RotaTeq have found that <b>vaccines</b> dramatically reduced severe disease among infants. In September 2013, the vaccine was offered to all children in the UK, aged between two and three months, and it is expected to halve the cases of severe infection and reduce the number of children admitted to hospital because of the infection by 70 percent.
