The cable type chosen for the Orion Service Module was no. 8 quadrax cable. The increase in electrical noise induced on these no. 8 quadrax cables was measured at the NASA Glenn <b>vibration</b> <b>facility</b> in the Structural Dynamics Laboratory. The intensity of the vibrations was set at 32 g, which was the maximum available level at the facility. The cable lengths used during measurements were 1, 4, and 8 m. The noise measurements were done in an analog fashion using a performance network analyzer (PNA) by recording the standard deviation of the transmission scattering parameter S(sub 21) over the frequency range of 100 to 900 MHz. The standard deviation of S(sub 210 was measured before, during, and after the vibration of the cables at the <b>vibration</b> <b>facility.</b> We observed an increase in noise {{by a factor of}} 2 to 6.

Oxnard Field {{was transferred to the}} U. S. Engineers, Manhattan District, on July 21, 1945, who converted several wood frame structures to serve functions that were transferred from Los Alamos. Development of the SNL/New Mexico (SNL/NM) site began in 1946 and 1947 with construction of the first four buildings in what is now Tech Area I. Construction of another 14 permanent buildings in Tech Area I began in 1948. SNL constructed a high-explosive assembly area in Tech Area II, a half mile south of Tech Area I, and started plans for several outdoor testing facilities for Tech Area III, about seven miles to the south of Tech Area I, in 1952. By 1953, SNL completed and put into operation the first group of Tech Area III facilities, which included a rocket sled track, a large centrifuge, a <b>vibration</b> <b>facility,</b> and an instrument control center. Tech Area IV and Tech Area V were developed later to provide facilities for pulsed power and high-energy experiments. As the need developed for outdoor testing facilities remote from the public and other work areas, SNL added many facilities on U. S.

40|$|Structural {{dynamics}} {{identification is}} a common, long-standing procedure performed on large aerospace structures. During these tests, structural vibrations are evoked {{by a set}} of single exciters placed at suitable structural points. Multi-axis <b>vibration</b> <b>facilities</b> are recently utilized for the dynamic qualification of space structures performed for experimental dynamic load simulation. These facilities open up the possibility of performing structural dynamics identification by means of multiaxial base excitation. During the past few years, extensive research has been performed in this field at the Institute of Aeroelasticity. This report summarizes the results achieved up to now. Starting with the fundamentals, various methods of structural dynamics identification by means of multiaxial base excitation are explained including a variant of the phase resonance method, methods of phase separation in the frequency domain, as well as a method for analysis of transient vibrations in the time domain. The experimental application of these methods on a laboratory structure performed with DLR's multi-axis vibration simulator MAVIS is elucidated. The results are used to emphasize the specific features of the applied methods as well as the features of structural dynamics identification by means of multi-axial base excitation in general.

40|$|Large satellites, utilising the {{increased}} transport {{capabilities of the}} new European ARIANE- 5 launcher, have been developed or are presently under development by the European Space Agency ESA. The enlarged size category of these spacecraft rises new challenges of test methods and facilities for mechanical verification and qualification. The limits of existing <b>vibration</b> <b>facilities</b> were partially exceeded by the mass and overturning moments of the test specimen, asking for new test facilities or appropriate test methods. As an alternative approach to the conventional sine vibration tests with lateral and axial base excitations, {{an attempt was made}} to simulate the base input by means of modal survey testing with tuned modal exciter forces. In the mechanical verification process of spacecraft structures, the modal survey test is required for modal identification and for validation of the respective mathematical model. The vibration level of the test is relatively low with moderate exciter forces. A high-level "boosted" modal survey test with large multi-point modal forces {{can be used as a}} backup solution for spacecraft mechanical qualification. The test method was applied by DLR to the larg X-ray astronomy satellite XMM. The paper describes the fundamentals of the approach and gives an overview on the applied test performance including further applications. Emphasis is placed on the significance of non-linear behaviour, which has to be taken into account due to the large range of excitation levels...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{in space}} either on orbital {{missions}} on-board the ISS, or in suborbital missions using sounding rockets, like TEXUS {{as well as}} parabolic flight campaigns are still the gold standard to achieve real microgravity conditions {{in the field of}} gravitational biology and medicine. However, during launch, and in flight, hypergravity and vibrations occur which might interfere with the effects of microgravity. It is therefore important to know these effects and discriminate them from the microgravity effects. This can be achieved by ground-based facilities like centrifuges or vibration platforms. Recently, we have conducted several experiments with different thyroid cancer cell lines. This study, as part of the ESA-CORA-GBF 2010 - 203 project, focused on the influence of vibration and hypergravity on benign human thyroid follicular epithelial cells (Nthy-ori 3 - 1 cell line). Gene and in part protein expression regulation under both conditions were analyzed for VCAN, ITGA 10, ITGB 1, OPN, ADAM 19, ANXA 1, TNFA, ABL 2, ACTB, PFN 2, TLN 1, EZR, RDX, MSN, CTGF, PRKCA, and PRKAA 1 using quantitative real-time PCR and Western Blot. We found that hypergravity and vibration affected genes and proteins involved in the extracellular matrix, the cytoskeleton, apoptosis, cell growth and signaling. Vibration always led to a down-regulation, whereas hypergravity resulted in a more heterogeneous expression pattern. Overall we conclude that both conditions can influence gene regulation and production of various genes and proteins. As a consequence, it is important to perform control experiments on hypergravity and <b>vibration</b> <b>facilities</b> in parallel to flight experiments...|$|R
