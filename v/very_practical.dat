The low-slung variety of Field Spaniel were developed by Phineas Bullock from dogs previously owned by Sir Francis Burdett, the secretary of the Birmingham Dog Show. Burdett was said to have owned a variety of black Cocker Spaniels. Bullock crossed the Field Spaniel with the Sussex Spaniel and the English Water Spaniel. In the 1870s he was very successful in the show ring with his variety of Field Spaniel; however, it resulted in a dog that was almost exactly like a Sussex Spaniel {{with the exception of the}} head itself.|$|E

25|$|Ideal Motherhood (T. Y.

While presenting an ideal, the author does not carry it {{beyond the pale}} of the practical; she believes in the necessity of combining the masculine and feminine elements, the developed intellect and intuition, as commensurate factors in shaping the young life.

25|$|Due to the {{prevalence}} and devastation of ant attacks, M. drewseni {{has developed a}} way to protect themselves, but mainly their brood, from their predators. Females have a gland on their gaster that secretes a liquid; females are commonly seen rubbing their gaster along the stem of the nest. This secretion, which is spread on the stem, then, somehow prevents ants from climbing on the stem to reach the nest and the brood. In experiments, when ants {{come in contact with}} this secretion, they have a violent reaction and retract away from the secretion, suggesting that it is a chemical repellant of sorts. In addition, the structure of the nest itself and the morphology of the wasp seems to support a co-evolution of this defensive mechanism. The length of the stem separates the nest from any place that an ant would be. In addition, the elongated first abdominal piece of the wasp serves to allow the secretion to be spread over the whole stem, whose narrow diameter makes secretions economical. This system of defense is also <b>very</b> <b>practical</b> because it allows the female to forage and leave the brood unattended without putting them at risk. This repellant seems to be very effective with some ants, but not strong enough to derail army ants, as they travel in huge groups.|$|E

25|$|Although oak barrels {{have long}} been used by winemakers, many wineries now use oak wood chips for aging wine more quickly and also adding desired woody aromas along with vanilla flavors. It is a common {{misconception}} that oak imparts butter flavors to wine. This is not so. The butter flavors come from lactic acid, naturally present in the wine, converted during malolactic fermentation to diacetyl. This process reverses itself, although the addition of sulfur dioxide prevents this, and the diacetyl remains. Oak chips can be added during fermentation or during aging. In the latter case, they are generally placed into fabric sacks and placed into the aging wine. The diversity of chips available gives winemakers numerous options. Oak chips {{have the benefit of}} imparting intense oak flavoring {{in a matter of weeks}} while traditional oak barrels would need a year or more to convey similar intensity. Critics claim that the oak flavoring from chips tend to be one-dimensional and skewed towards the vanilla extract with the wines still lacking some of the physical benefits that barrel oak imparts. The use of oak powder is also less common than chips, although they are a <b>very</b> <b>practical</b> alternative if oak character is to be introduced during fermentation. Oak planks or staves are sometimes used, either during fermentation or aging. Wines made from these barrel alternatives typically do not age as well as wines that are matured in barrels. Improvements in micro-oxygenation have allowed winemakers to better mimic the gentle aeration of oak barrels in stainless steel tanks with oak chips.|$|E

500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page.

[...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But sheâ€™s practical. Sheâ€™s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuesterâ€™s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. Sheâ€™s <b>very</b> <b>practical</b> in the fact that she doesnâ€™t want to be alone and she knows that sheâ€™s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, heâ€™s not exactly like Will, but heâ€™s good to her and heâ€™s solid. Heâ€™s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So sheâ€™s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So itâ€™s weird. Sheâ€™s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But sheâ€™s also got this <b>very</b> <b>practical,</b> down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. Itâ€™s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak.

500|$|The name of Nock {{is perhaps}} best known today for the multi-barrelled Nock gun due to it being {{featured}} in several films. [...] These include uses of this volley gun by the characters Patrick Harper in Sharpe and Jim Bowie in The Alamo. Nock was the manufacturer, but not the inventor, of this weapon. Despite its portrayal in film, this weapon was not <b>very</b> <b>practical</b> as a hand weapon due its very severe recoil, often causing injuries, and {{the time needed to}} reload the seven barrels. [...] It was necessary to abandon the rifling of the early prototypes and reduce the charge to keep this problem manageable. Intended as a naval weapon fired from the rigging to repel boarders on the deck, it was retired by the Royal Navy in 1804.

The KGB tried repeatedly to recruit him, but was never successful; Oppenheimer did not betray the United States. In addition, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan Project who had sympathies to the Soviet Union. Haynes, Klehr and Vassiliev also state Oppenheimer [...] "was, in fact, a concealed member of the CPUSA in the late 1930s".

500|$|Fuming was an {{accidental}} discovery in England {{after it was}} noticed that oak boards stored in a stable had darkened. [...] This {{was caused by the}} ammonia fumes from the horse urine reacting with the wood. [...] At {{the end of the nineteenth}} and beginning of the twentieth centuries fuming became popular with furniture makers in the Arts and Crafts movement. [...] The technique was introduced to the US by Gustav Stickley in 1901 and a manufacturing technique was perfected in the mission style furniture line of the Stickley family business. [...] Stickley also described a method of fuming the wooden architecture of an entire room by setting down bowls of ammonia within the room and completely sealing it. [...] This method was not <b>very</b> <b>practical</b> and quite dangerous for the person placing the ammonia without the personal protective equipment available to modern workers. [...] Stickley was quickly followed by other American Arts and Crafts furniture makers [...] such as Charles Limbert and the Roycroft community.|$|E

[...] Earlier, while playing solitaire during his recovery from surgery, Ulam had thought about playing hundreds of games to estimate statistically the probability of a successful outcome. [...] With ENIAC in mind, he realized that the availability of computers made such statistical methods <b>very</b> <b>practical.</b> John von Neumann immediately saw the significance of this insight. In March 1947 he proposed a statistical approach to the problem of neutron diffusion in fissionable material. [...] Because Ulam had often mentioned his uncle, MichaÅ‚ Ulam, [...] "who just had to go to Monte Carlo" [...] to gamble, Metropolis dubbed the statistical approach [...] "The Monte Carlo method". Metropolis and Ulam published the first unclassified paper on the Monte Carlo method in 1949.|$|E
