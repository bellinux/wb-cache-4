40|$|Abstract Despite over {{a century}} of {{clinical}} use and a well-documented record of efficacy and safety, a growing minority in society questions the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> and fear that this common public health intervention is the root-cause of severe health problems. This article questions whether growing public anti-vaccine sentiments might {{have the potential to}} spill-over into other therapies distinct from vaccination, namely allergen-immunotherapy. Allergen-immunotherapy shares certain medical vernacular with vaccination (e. g., allergy shots, allergy vaccines), and thus may become "guilty by association" due to these similarities. Indeed, this article demonstrates that anti-vaccine websites have begun unduly discrediting this allergy treatment regimen. Following an explanation of the anti-vaccine movement, the article aims to provide guidance on how clinicians can respond to patient fears towards allergen-immunotherapy in the clinical setting. This guide focuses on the provision of reliable information to patients in order to dispel misconceived associations between vaccination and allergen-immunotherapy, and the discussion of the risks and benefits of both therapies in order to assist patients in making autonomous decisions about their choice of allergy treatment. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceData on <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> {{self-reported}} <b>vaccinations</b> are scarce. This study, {{performed on}} healthcare students in Paris (France), aimed to evaluate this validity for occupational <b>vaccinations.</b> The <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> self-reported <b>vaccination</b> status was compared with written information. A total of 432 students were enrolled. Sensitivity rates for BCG, hepatitis B and measles were over 74 %. For diphtheria-tetanus-polio and pertussis, sensitivity was below 50 %. Specificity was between 70 and 95 % for dTP-pertussis, and below 35 % for all others. Overall, the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> self-reported information was low, meaning that checking medical records remains the preferable strategy for assessing immunization status...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recall bias {{is likely}} to occur in vaccine {{effectiveness}} studies using self-reported <b>vaccination</b> history. The <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> patient-reported <b>vaccination</b> status for adults is not well defined. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> self-reported pneumococcal <b>vaccination</b> history among patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Methods: Prospective ancillary study of a population-based observational study of hospitalized patients with CAP in the city of Louisville. To be included in the analysis, patients had to (i) be reached by phone 30 -days after discharge from the hospital and (ii) report that they remembered whether or not they received a pneumococcal vaccine in the past five years. The vaccination history was classified as 1) Subjective: patient recollection, or 2) Objective: vaccination records from insurance companies or primary care physicians. Results: A total of 2, 787 patients who recalled their vaccination history were included in the analysis. Subjective vaccination history was documented to be inaccurate in 1, 023 (37 %) patients. Conclusions: Our study indicates that in adult patients, self-reported data regarding pneumococcal vaccination {{is likely to}} be inaccurate in one out of three patients. This level of recall bias may incorporate a fatal flaw in vaccine effectiveness studies...|$|R
40|$|Immunizations {{are crucial}} to the {{prevention}} of disease, thus, having an accurate measure <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> status for a population is an important guide in targeting prevention efforts. In order to comprehensively assess the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> self-reported adult <b>vaccination</b> status for the eight most common adult vaccines we conducted a survey <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> receipt and compared it to the electronic medical record (EMR), which {{was used as the}} criterion standard, in a population of community-dwelling patients in a large healthcare system. In addition, we assessed whether validity varied by demographic factors. The vaccines included: pneumococcal (PPSV), influenza (Flu), tetanus diphtheria (Td), tetanus diphtheria pertussis (Tdap), Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), hepatitis A (HepA), hepatitis B (HepB) and herpes zoster (shingles). Telephone surveys were conducted with 11, 760 individuals, 22 ̆ 030518, half with documented receipt <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> and half without.

40|$|Aims: The goal of {{the present}} study was to {{establish}} the efficacy of the measles vaccine and the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vaccination</b> schedule adopted in Italy. Materials & methods: The following procedures are adopted: analyze the compliance to the vaccination schedule; assess the seroprevalence of measles antibodies according to the year of birth and the number of doses; and investigate the persistence of positive antibodies post-vaccination. We gathered and elaborated data <b>of</b> both <b>vaccination</b> history and seroprevalence against measles in a large population of students (4195) belonging to the Medical School of Padua University (Italy). Results: Our results reveal a requirement for a two-dose vaccination schedule to ensure protection from the disease. Nevertheless, these results clearly indicate that the percentage of seropositivity reached using the two-dose strategy is below the percentage (95 %) that ensures optimal population immunity. Conclusion: It is uncertain whether immune coverage persists when circulating antibodies vanish, but two vaccine doses should prevent disease outbreaks...|$|R

40|$|Routine {{vaccination}} programmes {{have led}} to substantial declines {{in the incidence of}} most of the target diseases. In these circumstances, vaccine effects beyond those on the target diseases may become evident. Several studies have suggested that certain vaccines may influence mortality in low income settings in ways that cannot be attributed to effects on target diseases. Trials of such 'non-specific' effects are difficult if not impossible to organise; and observational studies of them are prone to serious confounding, because those who do or do not receive vaccines are likely to differ in many ways, some of which relate to their subsequent risk of early death, independent <b>of</b> <b>vaccination.</b> They are also prone to other biases, including the selective loss <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> records for children who die.

40|$|Objective Understand {{the effect}} of a health {{messaging}} intervention focused on provider communication about vaccination on mothers’ willingness to vaccinate children against HPV and seasonal influenza. Methods 2, 476 mothers of 9 - 13 -year-olds in the U. S. completed a Web-based survey in August 2014. Mothers were randomized to one of two groups targeting HPV or influenza vaccine. Mothers whose child had not received the target vaccine (i. e., zero doses of HPV vaccine/no prior-year administration of influenza vaccine) were randomized to the intervention. The study used a 3 x 2 between-subjects design; illustrated vignettes depicted one of three levels of provider recommendation strength (brief mention <b>of</b> <b>vaccination,</b> strong recommendation <b>of</b> <b>vaccination,</b> or personal disclosure <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>of</b> own children), and presence or absence of information comparing safety <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> to the safety of a common daily activity. Outcome was mothers’ willingness to have their child receive the target vaccine (0 - 100.) Perceived benefits <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> were assessed prior to viewing the intervention and included as a covariate in analyses, along with child gender. Results For HPV vaccine, there was a main effect of safety information, F(1, 684) = 7. 99, p=. 005, and perceived benefits <b>of</b> <b>vaccination,</b> F(1, 684) = 221. 64, p<. 001) on mothers’ willingness to vaccinate. For influenza, perceived benefits <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> significantly related to willingness, F(1, 462) = 105. 78, p<. 001). Child gender was not associated with willingness. Conclusions Provider communication about vaccination may need to be tailored to the vaccine in question.

40|$|Background The {{childhood}} {{vaccination programme}} in Coventry Primary Care Trust (PCT) {{has resulted in}} consistently low uptake rates {{for a number of}} years. After an evaluation of operational processes, an examination of the data systems was performed. Methods The under-reporting <b>of</b> <b>vaccinations</b> performed and methodology issues were investigated using data collected by the Child Health Information Department (CHID) and the Finance Department. Results Data held by the Finance Department result in an uptake rate of between 0. 79 and 1. 92 % higher than those held by the CHID. Locally, the Southwest Child Health (SWIFT) system, the programme used to calculate uptake rates by many of the PCTs across the country, excludes those children residing outside the boundary but registered within it. Coventry PCT’s Cover <b>of</b> <b>Vaccination</b> Evaluated Rapidly (COVER) statistics are based on a subgroup of the responsible population. Conclusions The computer technology currently utilized by the NHS provides inaccurate statistics for the COVER programme. Systematic under-reporting to the CHID results in moderately lowered uptake rates.

40|$|AbstractVaccines are {{designed}} primarily to protect vaccinated individuals against the target infection. In {{addition to this}} direct effect <b>of</b> <b>vaccination,</b> vaccination may increase the level of population (or herd) immunity by increasing {{the proportion of the}} population who are immune from infection. For infections that are transmitted from person-to-person, or for which humans are important reservoirs of the infectious agent, an increase in the level of herd immunity may result in a lower force of infection in the population and thus a lower risk of infection among unvaccinated persons. This is called an indirect effect <b>of</b> <b>vaccination,</b> or a herd-protective effect. The effect <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> in increasing the level of herd immunity is important in disease elimination programmes as, because of the indirect effect <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> on risk <b>of</b> infection, elimination may be achieved without having to vaccinate the entire population.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the issue <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> {{coverage}} among children. Vaccination in the Czech Republic {{has a long tradition}} and represents a very effective protection of children and adults not only against infectious diseases, but also against their consequences. It also prevents the development <b>of</b> infectious diseases. <b>Vaccination</b> is one <b>of</b> the most successful preventive methods that affect the health of individuals and the whole population. Vaccination is also very important for unvaccinated individuals. If the population reaches a high level <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> coverage, the spread of infection between vaccinated individuals is interrupted which significantly reduces the risk of transmission of infection to unvaccinated individuals as well. Vaccination thus protects also those who cannot be vaccinated because of illness, decreased immunity or other reasons. Currently, however, there are some opinions which question the usefulness and importance <b>of</b> compulsory <b>vaccination.</b> An increasing number of those who refuse vaccination occur due to the increased accessibility of the Internet and social networks, where we can notice a growing amount of information to the disadvantage <b>of</b> <b>vaccination.</b> The most common reason for refusing vaccination is the belief that some vaccinations are not necessary. The thesis is divided into two main parts - theoretical and practical. The first theoretical chapter contains an introduction to the issue <b>of</b> <b>vaccination.</b> In the following part of my thesis I deal with the system <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> in the Czech Republic, its planning, organization and control, and the role of public health protection authorities. The following chapter {{deals with the}} importance and division <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> and kinds <b>of</b> vaccines. The thesis is also focused on the diseases which are vaccinated against under mandatory vaccination scheme. At present mandatory vaccination in the Czech Republic includes vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, rubella, mumps, measles, transmissible polio, hepatitis B and invasive diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. Vaccination especially against tick-borne encephalitis, hepatitis A, diseases caused by pneumococci and invasive meningococcal disease is recommended.

40|$|Abstract Background: Although {{influenza}} vaccination is recommended during pregnancy as standard of care, limited surveillance {{data are available}} for monitoring uptake. Our aim was to evaluate the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> existing surveillance in Western Australia for measuring antenatal influenza immunisations. Methods: The self-reported <b>vaccination</b> status <b>of</b> 563 women who delivered between April and October 2013 was compared against three passive data collection sources: a state-wide antenatal {{influenza vaccination}} database maintained by the Department of Health, a public maternity hospital database, and a private health service database. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for each system using self-report as the “gold standard. ” Results: The state-wide antenatal vaccination database detected 45. 7 % (95 % CI: 40. 1 – 51. 4 %) <b>of</b> influenza <b>vaccinations,</b> the public maternity hospital database detected 66. 7 % (95 % CI: 55. 1 – 76. 9 %), and the private health service database detected 29. 1 % (95 % CI: 20. 5 – 39. 4 %). Specificity exceeded 90 % and positive predictive values exceeded 80 % for each system. Sensitivity was lowest for women whose antenatal care was provided by a private obstetrician.

The logistic regression analysis revealed that variables which increased the likelihood of having been vaccinated against influenza were: higher number of anti-hyperglycemic medications, increased number of co-morbidities, higher patients’ income, recommendation <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> from General Practitioners (GPs) and specialist. Significant predictors of pneumococcal vaccine uptake included increased number of co-morbidities and recommendation <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> received from GPs and specialist.

40|$|Abstract Background Influenza viruses are a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide. Vaccination remains a powerful tool for preventing or mitigating influenza outbreaks. Yet, vaccine supplies and daily administration capacities are limited, even in developed countries. Understanding how such constraints can alter the mitigating effects <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> is a crucial part of influenza preparedness plans. Mathematical models provide tools for government and medical officials to assess the impact <b>of</b> different <b>vaccination</b> strategies and plan accordingly. However, many existing models <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> employ several questionable assumptions, including a rate <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> proportional to the population at each point in time. Methods We present a SIR-like model that explicitly takes into account vaccine supply and the number of vaccines administered per day and places data-informed limits on these parameters. We refer to this as the non-proportional model <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> and compare it to the proportional scheme typically found in the literature. Results The proportional and non-proportional models behave similarly for a few different vaccination scenarios. However, there are parameter regimes involving the vaccination campaign duration and daily supply limit for which the non-proportional model predicts smaller epidemics that peak later, but may last longer, than those of the proportional model. We also use the non-proportional model to predict the mitigating effects <b>of</b> variably timed <b>vaccination</b> campaigns for different levels <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> coverage, using specific constraints on daily administration capacity. Conclusions The non-proportional model <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> is a theoretical improvement that provides more accurate predictions of the mitigating effects <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> on influenza outbreaks than the proportional model. In addition, parameters such as vaccine supply and daily administration limit can be easily adjusted to simulate conditions in developed and developing nations {{with a wide variety of}} financial and medical resources. Finally, the model can be used by government and medical officials to create customized pandemic preparedness plans based on the supply and administration constraints of specific communities. </p...|$|R
