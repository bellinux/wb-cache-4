Later that year, he was also appointed custos of the Pontifical College at Sant’Isidoro a Capo le Case, the home of Irish Franciscans in Rome. Egan remained there until 1790, {{when he returned to}} Ireland and was appointed custos of Ennis. He remained in Ireland until 1787 or 1788, when he may have made a <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> After several more years as a missionary in Ireland, Egan came (or returned) to the United States in 1802.|$|E

Local producers Rick Wurpel and Doug Stewart were also on the staff. Taylor's and McGuinness' original plans were to feature the video on The Tube, but trade unions objected to their limited representation on the concert crew. However, a compromise was reached, allowing 15 minutes of the concert to be broadcast on The Tube.|$|E
5|$|In 1953 the State Department's {{physical}} security was split between {{foreign and domestic}} branches. Uanna reorganized these into one group called the Division of Physical Security, consisting of four branches, and took over as its new chief. He then published the Protection of Dignitaries Manual and developed the handbook used at the training school for Marine Security Guards assigned to U. S. embassies, legations and consulates overseas. As Chief of the Division, Uanna {{was responsible for the}} security of all State's personnel and facilities in the United States and abroad. He was responsible for the security for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip's <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in 1957.|$|E

5|$|Construction of two prototypes {{began in}} February 1965: 001, built by Aérospatiale at Toulouse, and 002, by BAC at Filton, Bristol. Concorde 001 {{made its first}} test flight from Toulouse on 2 March 1969, piloted by André Turcat, and first went {{supersonic}} on 1 October. The first UK-built Concorde flew from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969, piloted by Brian Trubshaw. Both prototypes were presented {{to the public for}} the first time on 7–8 June 1969 at the Paris Air Show. As the flight programme progressed, 001 embarked on a sales and demonstration tour on 4 September 1971, which was also the first transatlantic crossing of Concorde. Concorde 002 followed suit on 2 June 1972 with a tour of the Middle and Far East. Concorde 002 made the first <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in 1973, landing at the new Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Airport to mark that airport's opening.|$|E
5|$|In {{getting the}} Philippine Army ready for war, MacArthur faced an {{enormous}} task. On a <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in 1937, MacArthur lobbied the Navy Department {{for the development}} of PT boats—small, fast boats armed with torpedoes—for which he believed that the geography of the Philippines, with its shallow waters and many coves, was ideally suited. The nascent Philippine Navy acquired three, known as Q boats, after President Manuel L. Quezon. In August 1941, the U.S. Navy created Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, under the command of Lieutenant (junior grade) John D. Bulkeley. It was a half-strength squadron, with only six PT boats instead of the normal twelve, numbered 31 to 35 and 41. It arrived at Manila in September 1941. It was understood that a fleet consisting of more than PT boats would be required for a successful defense of the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|During Nixon's {{visit to}} the Soviet Union in 1959, Khrushchev took part in what later {{became known as the}} Kitchen Debate. Nixon and Khrushchev had an impassioned {{argument}} in a model kitchen at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, with each defending the economic system of his country. Khrushchev was invited to visit the United States, and did so that September, spending thirteen days. Khrushchev arrived in Washington, DC on his first <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> on 15 September 1959. The first visit by a Soviet premier to the United States resulted in an extended media circus. Khrushchev brought his wife, Nina Petrovna, and adult children with him, though it was not usual for Soviet officials to travel with their families. The peripatetic premier visited New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco (visiting a supermarket), Coon Rapids, Iowa (visiting Roswell Garst's farm), Pittsburgh, and Washington, concluding with a meeting with U.S. President Eisenhower at Camp David. During luncheon at the Twentieth Century-Fox Studio in Los Angeles Khrushchev engaged in an improvised yet jovial debate with his host Spyros Skouras over the respective merits of capitalism and communism. Khrushchev was supposed to visit Disneyland, but the visit was canceled for security reasons, much to his disgruntlement. He did, however, visit Eleanor Roosevelt at her home in Hyde Park, New York. While visiting IBM's new research campus in San Jose, California, Khrushchev expressed little interest in computer technology, but he greatly admired the self-service cafeteria, and, on his return, introduced self-service in the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|The {{proximity}} fuze {{had been}} pioneered by Alan Butement. The {{idea was that}} if a shell could explode when it was near an enemy aircraft, a near miss would be nearly as effective as a direct hit. The technical problem was to miniaturise a radar set, and make it sturdy enough to be fired from a gun barrel. The second problem had been solved by the Germans; a dud German bomb was salvaged that had valves that could withstand the acceleration. Plans {{were given to the}} Americans by the Tizard Mission, but work continued in Britain, where a team was established at Christchurch under Charles Drummond Ellis in February 1942. Work proceeded fitfully, and by 1943, production was still two years away. On a <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in November 1943, Cockcroft discussed adapting the American proximity fuze for British use with Merle Tuve. As a result, 150,000 fuzes for QF 3.7-inch AA guns were ordered on 16 January 1944. The fuzes arrived in time to engage the V-1 flying bombs in August 1944, shooting down 97 per cent of them. For his services, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the storm's passage, the Government of Thailand began distributing {{relief goods}} to {{residents}} throughout the affected provinces. Despite the effort by the government, 2,500 people from Pa Thiew and Tha Sae demonstrated for additional and more intensive aid on 9 November. These protests were soon dispersed. Following considerable criticism for downplaying {{the impact of the}} typhoon, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan delayed his <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> to oversee relief efforts. By 15 November the United States pledged to donate US$25,000 for recovery operations. Telephone connection was restored from Bangkok to Prachuap Khiri Khan by this time; however, areas further south remained disconnected. Generators were brought in to keep hospitals and government offices running since much of Chumphon Province remained without electricity for more than two weeks. As the scale of damage became more apparent, a request for international aid was made by 17 November to the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. Upon the announcement of the request, six countries pledged to provide nearly US$510,000 in funds collectively. Agriculture across Surat Thani Province was severely affected by the typhoon in the long-term as well. In the four years following Typhoon Gay, land use for orchards, rubber, and oil palm plantations decreased from 33.32percent to 30.53percent. Additionally, rice paddy coverage decreased from 22.96percent to 13.03percent.|$|E

He was accompanied by the most famous British suffragette, Emmeline Pankhurst, who championed the causes of Britain's small allies (Belgium and Serbia) during World War I. A <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> of America and Canada with such a well-known person caused such a sensation, brought crowds to Mijatović's lectures, and enabled him to have well attended lectures and to give interviews to the leading dailies.|$|E
