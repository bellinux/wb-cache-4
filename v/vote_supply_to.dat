50|$|Bullet {{voting is}} when a voter votes for just one candidate, despite having the option to vote {{for more than one}} due to a voting method such as {{approval}} voting, plurality-at-large voting, and Condorcet methods. A voter helps their preferred candidate by not <b>supplying</b> <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> potential rivals. Since a voter helps their preferred candidate and does not support another candidate more strongly than their sincere preference, bullet voting is not a type of tactical voting. Bullet voting is a type of sincere voting. This strategy is encouraged and seen as sometimes beneficial in the methods of limited voting and cumulative voting.|$|R

This step was taken by Mr. Fox immediately after his giving his assent to the grant of <b>supply</b> <b>voted</b> <b>to</b> him by Mr. Serjeant Adair and a committee of gentlemen who assumed to themselves to act {{in the name of the}} public. In the instrument of his acceptance of this grant, Mr. Fox took occasion to assure them that he would always persevere in the same conduct which had procured to him so honorable a mark of the public approbation. He was as good as his word.|$|R

5000|$|After {{four years}} Warnock {{returns to the}} USA, where his wife miscarries a long-hoped-for {{daughter}} before giving birth to a son. Warnock also coordinates a US visit and speech by Abdullah which convinces a wealthy senator to donate to the cause. Against the wishes of Warnock's superior Walter Barnes, who believes such a move might backfire {{in the future and}} removes all trace of deniability, a US committee <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> the Afghan warlords with Stinger missiles. Warnock returns to Afghanistan where he refuses Gromov's plea to let the Soviets retreat with dignity and alienates Craig by continuing to support Pakistan's backing of Hekmatyar. He meets Gromov as he departs Peshawar and then has a final meeting with Abdullah (this time in Afghanistan) before going back to the USA. He learns from Abdullah that Saeed has been killed by the Soviets and that Saeed was in fact Abdullah's son, a fact he had not previously revealed to Warnock. Warnock asks to buy back the Stinger missiles but learns Abdullah has sold them to Iran and allied himself with Hekmatyar until the Soviets are finally defeated. Abdullah then closes the play with a warning that the Mujahadeen will defeat the Soviets then [...] "cross oceans" [...] to spread Islamism.|$|R
