500|$|The SG-1000 {{is powered}} by an 8-bit Zilog Z80 central {{processing}} unit running at 3.58 MHz for the SG-1000 and SG-1000 II, and at 4MHz for the SC-3000. [...] Its <b>video</b> <b>processor</b> is a Texas Instruments TMS9928A, capable of displaying up to 16 colors, and its sound processor is a Texas Instruments SN76489. [...] All three chips were also used in the ColecoVision. [...] The system includes 8 kbit (1 kB) of random access memory (RAM) and 16 kbit (2 kB) of video RAM. [...] The controller is hardwired to the system in the original model, and detachable in the SG-1000 II. [...] Video and audio output are supplied through an RF switch. [...] Power is supplied through a 9V DC connector connected to an AC adapter.|$|E
