A number of experiments are conducted with different drivers, using a driving simulator. The results show how the proposed IESP provides a positive control influence.

50|$|A {{hydraulic}} <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (HPS) uses {{hydraulic pressure}} supplied by an engine-driven pump {{to assist the}} motion of turning the <b>steering</b> wheel. Electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (EPS) is more efficient than hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> since the electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> motor only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned, whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly. In EPS, the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type, road speed, and even driver preference. An added benefit is the elimination of environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> fluid. In addition, electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls, whereas hydraulic assistance stops working if the engine stops, making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steering—without any help—but also the power-assistance system itself.|$|R
