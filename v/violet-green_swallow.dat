5|$|Snakes {{such as the}} ringneck snake, western yellow-bellied racer, striped whipsnake, and Pacific gopher snake live in the oak savanna region. Birds such as the oak titmouse, ash-throated flycatcher, white-breasted nuthatch, western bluebird, <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallow,</b> acorn woodpecker, black-headed grosbeak, and American kestrel {{have also}} been found in this region. The rocks {{are known to be}} the northernmost place blue-gray gnatcatchers inhabit. Gall wasps live in this area, often {{creating}} galls in oak trees by injecting their larva into their leaves and branches.|$|E
25|$|The Salmon Falls Creek {{watershed}} {{varies widely}} {{in terms of}} different habitats. Along the lower section of the creek, plentiful water flow and numerous springs create a rich riparian environment compared to an oasis, lined with coyote willow, dogwood, golden currant, cattail, mint and poison ivy. The upper section is a slow-moving waterway that supports a small wetland and extensive meadows. In contrast, {{the vast majority of}} the upper undeveloped watershed is a shrub-steppe sagebrush grassland, much of which is used for grazing. Many bird species use the Salmon Falls Creek canyon, including white-throated swift, canyon and rock wrens, cliff swallow, <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallow,</b> barn swallow, screech owl, long-eared owl, great horned owl, kestrel, red-tailed hawk, golden eagles and prairie falcon. Mule deer also inhabit areas of the middle and upper Salmon Falls Creek basin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> are {{secondary}} cavity nesters and aerial insectivores, making males {{susceptible to}} nest and mate competition. To avoid being cuckolded, males {{spend more time}} guarding their mate than their nest, contrary to tree swallows. This paternity-defence behaviour emphasizes that non-territorial <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> exhibit greater mate competition than nesting site competition.|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{accounts}} of <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> forming cooperative {{relationships with other}} species have been recorded. From 1981 to 1982, three independent swallow pairs were observed co-occupying the nest boxes of western bluebirds. These <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> protected the nesting site, removed fecal sacs from the boxes and fed the bluebird fledglings with no resistance from the adult western bluebirds. Despite too small of a sample size to hold statistical significance, fledgling survival was greater when <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> provided active care. It is believed that the swallows benefit from the cooperative relationship by inheriting the nest box after the bluebird parents and fledglings have left.|$|R
50|$|Hybridization {{has been}} known to occur among the swallows, with a few cases {{involving}} <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> being reported. Breeding between <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> and both tree and barn swallows has been recorded on separate occasions, but resulting offspring were not observed. In 2000, the strange plumage of a swallow seen in British Columbia, Canada suggested the possible successful hybridization of a <b>violet-green</b> and cliff <b>swallow.</b> Nonetheless, these observations are rare hence why minimal research has looked into swallow hybridization.|$|R

500|$|Before {{the area}} became urban, large mammals {{including}} bobcats, black bears, foxes, cougars, wolves, and elk thrived in the area. Common {{species in the}} 21stcentury include crow, robin, starling, song sparrow, Bewick's wren, house finch, cedar waxwing, <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallow,</b> belted kingfisher, great blue heron, mallard, wood duck, bushtit, black-capped chickadee, raccoon, opossum, nutria, and moles. Less developed areas support black-tailed deer, coyotes, deer mice, voles, bats, western flycatchers, black-headed grosbeaks, orange-crowned warblers, common mergansers, and woodpeckers. Other wildlife in the watershed include beaver, river otter, freshwater mussels, and bald eagles. Johnson Creek and its watershed are home to life forms that, under Oregon law, have been listed as [...] "sensitive" [...] species. These are naturally reproducing native animals that may become threatened or endangered throughout all or any significant part of their range in Oregon. Such animals known {{to live in the}} Johnson Creek watershed include long-toed, northwestern, and Columbia salamanders, red-legged frogs, painted turtles, great horned owls, toads, hawks, and coyotes. A plant found on Powell Butte, tall bugbane (Actaea elata), is also listed as a sensitive species.|$|E

50|$|The type {{of habitat}} {{occupied}} by <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> {{varies depending on}} their geographical location and elevation. Across their range, these birds {{can be found in}} deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests, as well as within canyons and in close proximity to large cliffs. Breeding and non-breeding habitats do not differ much except that breeding habitat is usually at lower elevations. <b>Violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> have also been observed nesting around buildings in more settled areas.|$|R
5000|$|The marsh is {{man-made}} and is home {{to great}} blue herons, mallards, Canada geese, ring-necked ducks, hooded mergansers, American wigeons, <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> and red-winged blackbirds.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to reaching borderline hypothermic temperatures during bouts of torpor, <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> {{have been observed}} behaving similar to hyperthermic individuals while sunbathing. Indications of this activity include the orientation of their wings and tail, their trance-like state and the occasional loss of balance. Research has shown that increasing feather temperatures during basking can control ectoparasites. The period of sunbathing in <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> is short and dependent on ambient temperature and wind velocity, but typically occurs after an increase in parasite loads {{near the end of}} nesting.|$|R
50|$|The {{distinct}} body form of swallows distinguishes {{them from}} other passerine birds. Their long pointed wings and slim, streamlined body evolved to catch insects while in flight. The {{body of the}} <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallow</b> is no exception. With an average body length of 5Â¼ in. (13 cm), the <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallow</b> is slightly shorter and appears more compact in flight compared to {{other members of the}} Hirundinidae family. The <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallow</b> most closely resembles the North American tree swallow, but can be distinguished by its shorter wings and colouration.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{knowledge}} gaps surrounding the vocalization behaviour of <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows.</b> These gaps include vocalizations made during early development, alarm calls {{and the daily}} pattern of calls. The little information available suggests two main classes of vocalizations, the chee-chee calls and twitter calls.|$|R
50|$|Two {{islands are}} in Crater Lake: Wizard Island, formed from a cinder cone that erupted after Crater Lake {{began to fill}} with water, and the smaller Phantom Ship, which has seven trees living on it. There are also colonies of <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> and several {{varieties}} of wildflowers and lichens living there.|$|R
50|$|Observations of <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> making twitter calls {{typically}} {{associate the}} vocalization with courtship displays {{and the establishment}} of new territories. Twitter calls have only been heard in flight, either by a male escorting a female or during brief intraspecific territorial disputes. Mixing of the two calls occurs occasionally, but little ecological research can explain its use.|$|R

50|$|Violet-green {{swallows}} {{have been}} observed cooperating and competing with various avian species, including western bluebirds. A similar field observation notes a <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallow</b> laying an egg in an active bluebird nest box. Initially, the male bluebird attempted to drive the swallow from the nest cavity, while the female bluebird did not seem concerned with the intruder. It appeared the bluebirds tolerated the act of egg-dumping by the <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallow,</b> but the observer returned the following day to find the newly laid egg smashed below the nest. This behaviour suggests that when unable to access her original nest after physiologically committing to laying her egg, a female <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallow</b> may participate in interspecific egg-dumping.|$|E

50|$|Wildlife {{can often}} be seen in this high {{altitude}} setting. Mule deer and porcupines are common, as are rodents and similar animals such as marmots, golden-mantled ground squirrels, pocket gophers, and chipmunks. Mountain lions and other larger animals {{live in the area}} but are seldom seen. Common birds include the Clark's nutcracker, <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows,</b> and the common raven.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} speculated that certain birds, {{including}} swallows, enter a state of torpidity during harsh winter conditions. Few observations of this decrease in body temperature and metabolic rate have been recorded in <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows,</b> the first case occurring in 1965 near Death Valley National Monument in Saratoga Springs, California. Field observers noted 3 âdeadâ individuals on the east-facing slope of a dune the morning after a cold and windy night. Upon closer observation, the <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> made minor movements, such as opening their eyes, but did not struggle while being handled. The physical appearance of the swallows, including the position of their head {{in relation to the}} slope and the fluffing of their feathers was similar to that of other birds in torpor. Despite the lack of thermometers, it was apparent these 3 individuals were in a state of hypothermia for about 45 minutes after the sun began to rise. Eventually the 3 swallows awkwardly flew off, signifying the end of their torpor bout.|$|R
50|$|<b>Violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> are a {{predominantly}} western species, with the rare sighting {{of individuals in}} eastern North America. The distribution of the species can be divided based on the recognized subspecies, but the entire range spans from central Alaska down to Mexico. Longitudinally, the range borders {{the west coast of}} Alaska, British Columbia and the United States, and extends eastward into southwestern Alberta, Montana, the Dakotas and Texas. The breeding range spans almost the entire distribution, while the winter range is restricted to Mexico.|$|R

50|$|The <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallow</b> {{gets its}} name from the {{colouration}} on its back and rump. The species is best identified by the glossy green {{on the top of the}} head and back as well as hints of purple on the nape, rump and upper tail. Below the green back, the remainder of the wing is a grayish-bronze. Similar to other swallows, T. thalassina is white below, but differs in that the white continues onto rump side-patches that almost meet at the base of the tail. These white rump side-patches sometimes look like one continuous stripe when in flight. White also extends onto the cheeks, partially surrounding the eye. The notch in the tail of the <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallow</b> is slightly shallower than that of the tree swallow, but deeper than the relatively flat tail of the cliff swallow.Violet-green swallows exhibit very little sexual dimorphism, with adult males simply showing brighter colours than adult females. Additionally, the white cheeks are not as prominent and the head is more bronze than green on the female. Juveniles are not as easily identifiable compared to adults due to their dull colouration. Similar to other juvenile swallows, especially the tree swallow, the juvenile <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallow</b> is white below and grayish-brown above. However, the more gradual change in colour and visible (but slightly reduced) white cheek patches can help identify juvenile individuals of the species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> {{are divided}} into three subspecies, T. t. thalassina, T. t. brachyptera and T. t. lepida differing in {{breeding}} ranges and wing length. T. t. thalassina has slightly longer wings and {{has been known to}} breed as far north as Alaska, while the shorter winged T. t. brachyptera breeds further south in California and Mexico. Not all of the literature agrees upon T. t. lepida as a 3rd subspecies, and little information is available to help distinguish it from other subspecies.|$|R
5000|$|Similar {{to other}} <b>swallows,</b> <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> are {{specialized}} aerial insectivores, catching and eating their prey while in flight. However, {{they have been}} known to feed higher in the sky than most other swallows.The examination of the stomach contents of multiple individuals has presented a wide range of diet items, including insects like ants, beetles and flies as well as other arthropods such as spiders. [...] On rare occurrences these birds have been observed foraging along the ground, but such events represent exceptions to their typical feeding habits.|$|R
50|$|<b>Violet-green</b> <b>swallows</b> {{will usually}} arrive to their {{breeding}} area {{weeks prior to}} the start of reproduction. Location dependent, copulation takes place mid-May with the eggs being laid by the start of June, followed by a couple weeks of incubation before hatching. The average clutch size is 5 eggs, with females laying approximately 1 per day. During the weeks post-hatching, their parents feed the young as they slowly begin to grow their feathers. After approximately 3 weeks the young are ready to leave the nest. It is more common for pairs to reproduce once per breeding season, but a second brooding has been observed on occasion.|$|R
50|$|This call is most {{commonly}} heard when one <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallow</b> interacts with another swallow, either during foraging, in-flight chases or when approaching a nesting site. Flocks of swallows {{have been recorded}} making chee-chee calls, suggesting its use in social cohesion. Juveniles have also been observed making this vocalization when waiting to be fed by an adult, implying that it {{plays a role in}} parent-juvenile recognition.|$|E
50|$|The {{swallows}} {{have been}} well studied ecologically, but only recently has their phylogeny been thoroughly researched. Swallows are passerine birds grouped within the family Hirundinidae. The family Hirundinidae is split into two subfamilies: Pseudochelidoninae, which contains two species of river martins, and Hirundininae, comprising all other martins and swallows. The 82 species within the subfamily Hirundininae are further classified into three groupings: the mud nesters, basal relicts and core martins, with the <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallow</b> falling into the latter. Violet-green swallows are one of 9 species of New World tree swallows within the genus Tachycineta. This genus is a monophyletic group and is considered the sister taxa of all other New World swallows.Violet-green swallows are important members of the Tachycineta clade due to their large geographic range {{and because they are}} one of 2 species that breed within North America. It is agreed upon that Tachycineta is split into a North and South American clade, but the phylogenetic placement within the genus depends on the type of analysis used. The <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallow</b> {{is a member of the}} North American grouping, along with T. bicolor (the North American tree swallow), T. euchrysea (the golden swallow of Hispaniola and Jamaica) and T. cyaneoviridis (the Bahama swallow). A mitochondrial genome analysis has placed T. thalassina as a sister taxon of the Caribbean swallows, T. euchrysea and T. cyaneoviridis, with all 3 species forming a sister clade to T. bicolor. Nuclear genome analyses and a consensus of both methods have reorganized this North American clade, alternating the closest sister taxon of T. thalassina between T. cyaneoviridis and T. euchrysea. Nonetheless, the taxonomy of the <b>violet-green</b> <b>swallow</b> is well understood up to the genus level, after which some uncertainty surrounds the placement of T. thalassina within the North American clade of the Tachycineta genus.|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{information}} about the nesting habitats of birds, including those needed for successful nesting, can provide {{a better understanding of}} the ecological factors that permit coexistence of different species and may aid in conservation efforts. From 1989 through 1994, we studied the nesting habitat of secondary cavity-nesting birds in oak woodlands at the San Joaquin Experimental Range, Madera County, CA. We measured habitat surrounding nests and examined similarities and differences in nesting habitat used by eight species to evaluate overlap in nesting habitat use and possible competition. Nesting habitat of Bewickâs Wrens (Thryomanes bewickii) was unique among the species studied. Their nests were the lowest and located in the densest habitat on the steepest slopes where interior live oaks (Quercus wislizenii) were abundant. Nesting habitat was similar among European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana), and <b>Violet-green</b> <b>Swallows</b> (Tachycineta bicolor). These species all nested in open areas with the highest density of blue oaks (Quercus douglasii), the lowest densities of live oaks and snags, and the lowest basal area of trees. Nests of White-breasted Nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis) were similar to the above thre...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Natural and {{anthropogenic}} fire {{once played}} an important role in oak woodlands of California. Although lightning-ignited fires were infrequent, the California Indians used fire to modify oak woodland vegetation for at least 3, 000 yr. These high-frequency, low-intensity fires likely resulted in little mortality of mature oaks, low but continuous tree recruitment, an open understory, and a fine-grained mosaic of vegetation patches. Following settlement by Europeans in the mid- 1800 s, ranchers burned to reduce shrub cover and to increase grassland area and forage production; surface fires were common with average fire-return intervals of 8 â 15 yr. Fire suppression, begun in the 1940 s to 1950 s, led to increases in surface and crown fuels, invasion of woody vegetation in the understory, and increased tree density. In the absence of demonstrated fire effects on oak woodland birds, we used changes in vegetation structure expected to result from fire and fire suppression to predict the response of oak woodland birds to fire and fire suppression based on nesting habitat of 17 common oak woodland species breeding at the San Joaquin Experimental Range, Madera County, California. Our results suggest that populations of Western Kingbirds (Tyrannus verticalis), Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana), and <b>Violet-green</b> <b>Swallows</b> (Tachycineta thalassina), would increase in abundance following fire, because they consistently nested in habitat similar to that expected to result from frequent, low-intensity fire. The species predicted to respond negatively to changes resulting from fire differed among the variables examined. If fir...|$|R
