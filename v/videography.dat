25|$|Since their formation, Gwar have {{released}} thirteen studio albums, two live albums, and numerous singles among other recordings, and have sold over 820,000 {{records in the}} United States. Fueled largely by the controversies surrounding their concerts, Gwar experienced brief mainstream notoriety {{during the first half}} of the 1990s, receiving regular airplay on MTV as well as frequent in-character guest appearances on daytime talk shows, satirizing the topics of censorship and media violence. Though the band's mainstream popularity declined by the end of the 1990s, Gwar has retained a dedicated cult following. The band's extensive <b>videography</b> consists of both live recordings and long-form feature films, most notably 1992's Phallus in Wonderland, which earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Long Form Music Video. Outside of music and video, Gwar has expanded their franchise into comic books, trading cards, a board game, signature beers, barbecue sauces, and e-liquids.|$|E
25|$|Chasers heavily utilize still {{photography}} {{since the}} beginning. <b>Videography</b> gained prominence by the 1990s {{into the early}} 2000s but a resurgence of photography occurred {{with the advent of}} affordable and versatile digital SLR (DSLR) cameras. Prior to this, 35 mm SLR print and slide film formats were mostly used, along with some medium format cameras. In the late 2000s, mobile phone 3G data networks became fast enough to allow live streaming video from chasers using webcams. This live imagery is frequently used by the media, as well as NWS meteorologists, emergency managers, and the general public for direct ground truth information, and it provides video sales opportunities to chasers. Also by this time, camcorders using memory cards to record video began to be adopted. Digital video had been around for years but was recorded on tape, whereas solid-state is random access rather than sequential access (linear) and has no moving parts. Late in the 2000s HD video began to overtake SD (which had been NTSC in North America) in usage as prices came down and performance increased (initially there were low-light and sporadic aliasing problems due to chip and sensor limitations). By the mid-2010s 4K cameras were increasingly in use. Tripods are used by those seeking crisp professional photo and video imagery and also enable chasers to tend to other activities.|$|E
25|$|Conventional wisdom {{has held}} that beavers girdle and fell trees {{and that they}} {{diminish}} riparian trees and vegetation, but the opposite appears to be true when studies are conducted longer-term. In 1987, Beier reported that beavers had caused local extinction of Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) on 4–5% of stream reaches on the lower Truckee River in the Sierra Nevada mountains; however willow (Salix spp.) responded by regrowing vigorously in most reaches. He further speculated that without control of beaver populations, aspen and cottonwood could go extinct on the Truckee River. Not only have aspen and cottonwood survived ongoing beaver colonization, but {{a recent study of}} ten Sierra Nevada streams in the Lake Tahoe basin using aerial multispectral <b>videography</b> has also shown that deciduous, thick herbaceous, and thin herbaceous vegetation are more highly concentrated near beaver dams, whereas coniferous trees are decreased. These findings are consistent with those of Pollock, who reported that in Bridge Creek, a stream in semiarid eastern Oregon, the width of riparian vegetation on stream banks was increased several-fold as beaver dams watered previously dry terraces adjacent to the stream. In a second study of riparian vegetation based on observations of Bridge Creek over a 17-year period, although portions of the study reach were periodically abandoned by beaver following heavy utilization of streamside vegetation, within a few years, dense stands of woody plants of greater diversity occupied a larger portion of the floodplain. Although black cottonwood and thinleaf alder did not generally resprout after beaver cutting, they frequently grew from seeds landing on freshly exposed alluvial deposits subsequent to beaver activity. Therefore, beaver appear to increase riparian vegetation given enough years to aggrade sediments and pond heights sufficiently to create widened, well-watered riparian zones, especially in areas of low summer rainfall.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Single Ladies" [...] was shot {{immediately}} after that of [...] "If I Were a Boy", but it received less attention during production than the [...] "higher-gloss, higher-profile video" [...] for [...] "If I Were a Boy". Both videos were shot in black-and-white in New York City and were directed by Jake Nava, with whom Beyoncé {{had worked on}} previous music videos including [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and [...] "Beautiful Liar". [...] "Single Ladies" [...] was choreographed by Frank Gatson and JaQuel Knight, and incorporates J-Setting choreography. The two music videos premiered on MTV's Total Request Live show on October 13, 2008 to reinforce the concept of conflicting personalities. The videos were released to other media outlets on the same date and subsequently included on Beyoncé's remix album with <b>videography,</b> Above and Beyoncé, and the platinum edition of I Am...

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "West Coast" [...] was noted to share several {{similarities}} with Del Rey's previous <b>videography.</b> Its black-and-white, old-school imagery recall her video for [...] "Blue Jeans" [...] {{and the introduction}} to [...] "National Anthem". While the home-recorded footage scenes were a technique previously used in [...] "Video Games" [...] and [...] "Summertime Sadness", and its tattooed hand close-ups recall those of [...] "National Anthem". One of Del Rey's love interests in the clip, Soileau, previously appeared in the same role in [...] "Blue Jeans" [...] and [...] "Born to Die", while another shares appearance similarities to her love interest in [...] "Ride". Del Rey's characteristic cat eye-make up and swaying actions were also highlighted. Speculation arose that her mature love interest in the visual {{was inspired by the}} [...] "old man" [...] character she sang of in [...] "Off to the Races" [...] and her then-fiancé, Barrie-James O'Neill. The clip garnered comparisons to Chris Isaak's music video for [...] "Wicked Game" [...] (1990).|$|E
500|$|Insects {{were the}} {{earliest}} organisms {{to produce and}} sense sounds. Insects make sounds mostly by mechanical action of appendages. In grasshoppers and crickets, this is achieved by stridulation. Cicadas make the loudest sounds among the insects by producing and amplifying sounds with special modifications to their body to form tymbals and associated musculature. The African cicada Brevisana brevis has been measured at 106.7decibels {{at a distance of}} [...] Some insects, such as the Helicoverpa zea moths, hawk moths and Hedylid butterflies, can hear ultrasound and take evasive action when they sense that they have been detected by bats. Some moths produce ultrasonic clicks that were once thought to have a role in jamming bat echolocation. The ultrasonic clicks were subsequently found to be produced mostly by unpalatable moths to warn bats, just as warning colorations are used against predators that hunt by sight. Some otherwise palatable moths have evolved to mimic these calls. More recently, the claim that some moths can jam bat sonar has been revisited. Ultrasonic recording and high-speed infrared <b>videography</b> of bat-moth interactions suggest the palatable tiger moth really does defend against attacking big brown bats using ultrasonic clicks that jam bat sonar.|$|E

500|$|Jocelyn Vena of MTV found {{influences}} of Gaga's past videos {{in the various}} avatars she plays You and I. She explained that: when [...] stands at a crossroads in a big hat, the image is reminiscent of 'Telephone' Gaga. When she sits nearly makeup-free at her piano in the cornfields, there are touches of the teary-eyed makeup-less Gaga from the 'Bad Romance' video. Flashes of her wedding may remind fans of the wedding dress she wore in the 'Judas' clip. Robot Gaga's facial structures recall some of the steampunk looks of her 'Alejandro' video. Those {{are only a few}} of the nods to past personae from her own <b>videography.</b> Devin Brown of CBS News felt that Gaga had finally returned to form with the video. [...] "After some visually pleasing but generally lackluster videos, she has finally come out with something to write home about. 'You and I' is arguably the best song on her sophomore release, Born This Way, and now has a video to match." [...] A Slant Magazine writer commented that the publication had a mixed reaction to the video, saying that it [...] "is essentially a collection of disconnected images we couldn't make heads or tails of." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{writer for}} Billboard noted that Gaga waded and stomped {{through the desert}} while wearing tiny shorts and then appears in a party, and the ending {{signified}} the singer to be alone, [...] "rolling in the desert". Jon Blistein from Rolling Stone described the visuals as [...] "an eye-popping, strobe-lit bacchanal" [...] with Gaga [...] " [...] a frenetic desert rager in the euphoric new video". Joey Nolfi from Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review, saying that it consisted of [...] "simple production design, emphasis on Gaga's unbridled choreography, and the noticeable absence of eccentric costumes and wigs" [...] which made it a [...] "radical departure" [...] from Gaga's <b>videography.</b> He noticed that the video was heavy on [...] "rock star energy" [...] {{and did not have}} any particular narrative just focusing on [...] "Gaga, the music, and the moves". Chelsea Stone from Teen Vogue complimented the dance nature of the clip and noted that Gaga had posted images from the video previously, as well as wore the same outfit from the video while announcing its premiere on Twitter. Bianca Gracie from Fuse commented that Gaga [...] "exudes fearlessness while she kicks up dust, drives around in a jeep and throws a wild party" [...] in the video. Carey O'Donnell from Papermag felt that the video [...] "enhanced" [...] the song with a [...] "sort of a 'Ohhhhh this is what we're doing' moment" [...] and it pointed to an unplugged era for Gaga.|$|E
500|$|Gregory Heaney {{from the}} website AllMusic {{positively}} reviewed the video album, writing, [...] " [...] combines the group's considerable vocal talents with their amazing choreography, delivering the total Destiny's Child package as a video greatest-hits compilation". Jacob Rohn from the website Black Entertainment Television (BET) felt that [...] "While each {{later became a}} star in their own right, Destiny's Child as a group was known for their edgy and visually magnetic videos". He further finished his review by writing, [...] "Destiny's Child Video Anthology is a must-have for any DC fan and anyone that misses the time when music videos were at their peak." [...] A writer of ABC News Radio similarly noted that the album was created for [...] "fans who studied all their moves" [...] and remember the choreography. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly felt the album was the most [...] "indulgent" [...] memory trip to {{the period of the}} late-1990s and early-2000s memory lane. He further described the videos as [...] "gaudy, stupid fun". However, a more mixed review came from The Morton Report writer Chaz Lipp who felt that the album was incomplete and noted that eight other videos from the group's <b>videography</b> were not released. He remarked that the unreleased videos for the songs, most notably the ones from the holiday album 8 Days of Christmas could have been included as bonus selections. Lipp concluded that Destiny's Child Video Anthology [...] "hits its peak with the group's best single, the irresistibly funky 'Bootylicious'".|$|E

Three edits exist for the [...] "Ego" [...] music video: an official video, a remix video featuring Kanye West, and a fan-exclusive video. The official video premiered on Beyoncé's official website on May 21, 2009. The remix music video, which features a cameo appearance of Kanye West, was included on the remix album with <b>videography</b> Above and Beyoncé – Video Collection & Dance Mixes.

500|$|Five {{other music}} video were {{produced}} {{to promote the}} album's singles. While the video for [...] "Black Cat" [...] was taken from live footage of Jackson's concerts, those for [...] "Escapade" [...] and [...] "Alright" [...] utilized a Broadway-influenced production. The video for [...] "Alright" [...] was an homage to choreographer Michael Kidd, who was asked {{to participate in the}} project and also featured appearances by the flash dancing Nicholas Brothers, actress Cyd Charisse and bandleader Cab Calloway. An extended version of the video also features rapper Heavy D. The somber video for [...] "Come Back To Me" [...] was filmed near the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. Similarly, [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" [...] was a notable departure from the typically elaborate choreography associated with Jackson's other videos, focusing on her as an individual rather than {{as a part of a}} dancing troupe. Featuring appearances by Antonio Sabàto, Jr. and Djimon Hounsou, the sandy beach setting exemplifies director Herb Ritts [...] "signature style through use of graceful movements, bold contrasts, and wide-open spaces." [...] The music video is also regarded as the origin of what would later become Jackson's sexually overt persona, freely displaying her legs, torso and cleavage, as well as touching her own bare skin and Sabàto, Jr's in a sensual manner. In Present Tense: Rock & Roll and Culture (1992), Anthony DeCurtis states that [...] "he video celebrates hedonism and voyeurism; there are languorous displays of Jackson's body in ripped jeans and brief top, and of several muscular male bodies, black and white, with bare arms, and chests."
