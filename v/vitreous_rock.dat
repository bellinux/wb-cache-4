5000|$|Appendix to [...] "The {{microscopic}} {{characters of}} the <b>vitreous</b> <b>rocks</b> of Montana, U.S.A." [...] by Frank Rutley FGS, Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, 1881, Vol. 37, issue 1-4, pp. 391-98 ...|$|R
60|$|Whichever way the eye turned, no tree, no {{speck of}} any green thing was seen--no {{more than in}} smithies. All laborers, of {{whatsoever}} sort, were hued like the men in foundries. The black vistas of streets were as the galleries in coal mines; the flagging, as flat tomb-stones, minus the consecration of moss, and worn heavily down, by sorrowful tramping, as the <b>vitreous</b> <b>rocks</b> in the cursed Gallipagos, over which the convict tortoises crawl.|$|R
50|$|In {{igneous rocks}} the first {{generation}} of crystals generally forms before the lava has emerged to the surface, that is to say, during the ascent from the subterranean depths to the crater of the volcano. It has frequently been verified by observation that freshly emitted lavas contain large crystals borne along in a molten, liquid mass. The large, well-formed, early crystals (phenocrysts) are said to be porphyritic; the smaller crystals of the surrounding matrix or ground-mass belong to the post-effusion stage. More rarely lavas are completely fused at the moment of ejection; they may then cool to form a non-porphyritic, finely crystalline rock, or if more rapidly chilled may in large part be non-crystalline or glassy (<b>vitreous</b> <b>rocks</b> such as obsidian, tachylyte, pitchstone).|$|R
5000|$|In petrology, spherulites (...) are small, rounded {{bodies that}} {{commonly}} occur in <b>vitreous</b> igneous <b>rocks.</b> They are often visible in specimens of obsidian, pitchstone and rhyolite as globules {{about the size}} of millet seed or rice grain, with a duller luster than the surrounding glassy base of the rock, and when they are examined with a lens they prove to have a radiate fibrous structure.|$|R
50|$|Volcanic {{glass is}} the {{amorphous}} (uncrystallized) product of rapidly cooling magma. Like {{all types of}} glass, it {{is a state of}} matter intermediate between the close-packed, highly ordered array of a crystal and the highly disordered array of gas. Volcanic glass can refer to the interstitial, or matrix, material in an aphanitic (fine grained) volcanic rock or can refer to any of several types of <b>vitreous</b> igneous <b>rocks.</b> Most commonly, it refers to obsidian, a rhyolitic glass with high silica content.|$|R
40|$|Volatile {{components}} in magma strongly influence many physical properties of melts and minerals. The temperature resolved degassing analysis of volcanic crystalline and <b>vitreous</b> <b>rocks</b> gives {{detailed information about}} volatile compounds in the melt. Aspecial high-temperature mass-spectrometry device in combination with a thermo-balance allows a quantitative determination of different volatile species. It enables a differentiation between the primary gas content in the magma and the gas released from decomposition of secondary alteration products. The gas release profiles give the following indications: i) during the littoral explosions of Pahoehoe lava the content of volatiles is not changed by interaction with air or sea water; ii) the degassing profiles of vitreous black sand verify the primary content of volatiles in the erupted melt, only CO 2 was detected; iii) the oxygen release profile gives significant indications for oxygen undersaturation of the erupted magma; iv) remelting of black sand in air at 1450 Â°C for 0. 45 h causes an oxygen saturation of the basaltic melt; v) remelting of black sand in argon atmosphere confirms the oxygen undersaturation of the melt; vi) remelting of black sand-black shale mixtures affects {{a significant change in}} the degassing profiles, especially in CO 2 -release. With the first investigations we can demonstrate that gas release curves of volcanic rocks are qualified for a) detection of the primary gas content of erupted magma; b) detection of alteration processes of the igneous glass; c) detection of contamination of the magma with adjacent rocks...|$|R
40|$|A <b>vitreous,</b> perlitie <b>rock</b> near Etzatl~n, west of Guadalajara, Mexico, {{has been}} argillized by hot spring activity. A {{continuous}} outcrop from fresh rock to relatively pure clay (halloysite) is exposed, and {{samples were collected}} along it to trace the progressive alteration. Alkali metals and silica were leached uring argillation, as was shown by analyses of the solid samples and solutions from laboratory hydrolysis of the rock. The interpretation that the original clay mineral was endellite is supported by experiments treating the clay with K-acetate and ethylene glycol. The random arrangement of Si-O-A 1 in the glass is thought o have favored development of disordered stacking in the clay mineral formed, hence endellite, and random distribution of very fine-grained clay crystals in the mass of clay...|$|R
60|$|Nor even at {{the risk}} of meriting the charge of absurdly believing in enchantments, can I {{restrain}} the admission that sometimes, even now, when leaving the crowded city to wander out July and August among the Adirondack Mountains, far from the influences of towns and proportionally nigh to the mysterious ones of nature; when at such times I sit me down in the mossy head of some deep-wooded gorge, surrounded by prostrate trunks of blasted pines and recall, as in a dream, my other and far-distant rovings in the baked heart of the charmed isles; and remember the sudden glimpses of dusky shells, and long languid necks protruded from the leafless thickets; and again have beheld the <b>vitreous</b> inland <b>rocks</b> worn down and grooved into deep ruts by ages and ages of the slow draggings of tortoises in quest of pools of scanty water; I can hardly resist the feeling that in my time I have indeed slept upon evilly enchanted ground.|$|R
40|$|Issue: When {{glass cullet}} is indiscriminately {{combined}} with Portland Cement, chemical reactions can occur which {{may reduce the}} strength of the concrete. These include sugar contamination and an alkalisilica reaction. To minimize the adverse effects of these reactions, ingredients and methods used in standard PCC production should be modified. Best Practice:An adverse result of using glass cullet in Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) is the alkali-silica reaction (ASR). PCC producers have known ASR for many years because it can also occur when using <b>vitreous</b> (glassy) <b>rock</b> or slag with high amorphous silica content. The silica from the cullet or aggregate can combine with the alkalis in Portland Cement to form a siliceous gel. This gel will then absorb water and expand, causing structural weaknesses in the concrete. In addition, when mixed in PCC, sugar can cause an unpredictable increase in setting time and a decrease in the ultimate strength. A number of methods have been proposed to minimize sugar residue contamination and ASR, or to reduce their adverse affects. Modifications to the standard production of PCC include the following: Cleaning of glass aggregate Use of low alkali cement Use of low alkali pozzolan or set retarde...|$|R
40|$|In the Kodiak accretionary complex, Kodiak Island, Alaska, pseudotachylyte {{occurs in}} black, locally <b>vitreous</b> ultrafine-grained fault <b>rock.</b> Microscopic {{observations}} {{show that the}} pseudotachylytes are composed of glass, with vesicles, amygdules, microlites, and flow structures, indicating a frictional melt. The pseudotachylyte is gradational to cataclasite and shows outcrop-scale injection and ductile deformation structures. The cataclasite was ductily mobile (i. e., fluidized) simultaneous with the formation and emplacement of pseudotachylyte melt. The pseudotachylytic rocks postdate the stratal disruption fabric of associated shear-zone melanges and show similar direction of thrust transport, and have undergone limited subsequent deformation. We interpret the stratal disruption as resulting from underthrusting of the subducting plate and pseudotachylyte development as the final activity of this thrust surface. The gradational contacts between pseudotachylyte and cataclasite demonstrate that the cataclasite also formed as a seismic product and may represent paleoseismic rupture zones, possibly of very great earthquakes, with or without accompanying pseudotachylytes. The pseudotachylytes are voluminous, and many are spatially disconnected from generation surfaces. This style is distinct from pseudotachylytes described in other environments, and this may explain the rarity of documented examples of subduction-thrust pseudotachylyte...|$|R
