Sprague sold his motor through Edison Co. It is easy to vary speed with DC motors, which made them suited {{for a number of}} applications such as electric street railways, machine tools and certain other industrial applications where speed control was desirable.|$|E
25|$|Early {{automobile}} {{generators and}} alternators had a mechanical voltage regulator using one, two, or three relays and various resistors {{to stabilize the}} generator's output at slightly more than 6 or 12 V, independent of the engine's rpm or the <b>varying</b> <b>load</b> on the vehicle's electrical system. Essentially, the relay(s) employed pulse width modulation to regulate {{the output of the}} generator, controlling the field current reaching the generator (or alternator) and in this way controlling the output voltage producing back into the generator and attempting to run it as a motor. The rectifier diodes in an alternator automatically perform this function so that a specific relay is not required; this appreciably simplified the regulator design.|$|E
25|$|This disc rotates {{at a fixed}} {{specific}} speed, set by the user. Each disc {{rotation speed}} is set to a particular frequency of the desired note. If the note being played (and making the lamps behind the disc flash) is {{at exactly the same}} frequency as the spinning of the disc, then the disc appears to be static (due to the persistence of vision) from the strobing effect. If the note is out of tune then the pattern appears to be moving as the light flashing and the disc rotation are out of sync from each other. The more out of tune the played note is, the faster the pattern seems to be moving, although in reality it always spins at the same speed for a given note. Many good turntables for vinyl disc records have stroboscopic patterns lit by the incoming AC power (mains). The power frequency, either 50 or 60Hz, serves as the reference, although commercial power frequency sometimes changes slightly (a few tenths of a percent) with <b>varying</b> <b>load.</b> Unless reference and measured quantity are interchanged, the operating principle is the same; the turntable speed is adjusted to stop drifting of the pattern.|$|E
5000|$|Steady, Static and Constant loads are the same. Transient loads include: {{quasi-static}} <b>loads</b> (slowly <b>varying</b> <b>loads</b> {{in which}} the effect of inertial is small enough to neglect) and dynamic <b>loads</b> (faster <b>varying</b> <b>loads).</b>|$|R

2500|$|The ferroresonant transformer, ferroresonant {{regulator}} or constant-voltage transformer {{is a type}} of saturating transformer used as {{a voltage}} regulator. These transformers use a tank circuit composed of a high-voltage resonant winding and a capacitor to produce a nearly constant average output voltage with a varying input current or <b>varying</b> <b>load.</b> The circuit has a primary on one side of a magnet shunt and the tuned circuit coil and secondary on the other side. [...] The regulation is due to magnetic saturation in the section around the secondary.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{rotating}} governor {{speed control}} was still variable {{under conditions of}} <b>varying</b> <b>load,</b> where the shortcoming {{of what is now}} known as proportional control alone was evident. The error between the desired speed and the actual speed would increase with increasing load. In the 19th century the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by James Clerk Maxwell in 1868 in his now-famous paper On Governors. He explored the mathematical basis for control stability, and progressed a good way towards a solution, but made an appeal for mathematicians to examine the problem. [...] The problem was examined further by Edward Routh in 1874, Charles Sturm and in 1895, Adolf Hurwitz, who all contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria.|$|E
50|$|The {{flow stress}} is an {{important}} parameter in the fatigue failure of ductile materials. Fatigue failure is caused by crack propagation in materials under a <b>varying</b> <b>load,</b> typically a cyclically <b>varying</b> <b>load.</b> The rate of crack propagation is inversely proportional to the flow stress of the material.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 To apply {{accurate}} {{procedures of}} structural analysis {{that are now}} available, the behavior of nailed joints in light-frame wood buildings under long-term loads needs to be studied. Such a behavior can best be evaluated by testing specimens under constant loads, which requires relatively simple testing arrangements. To provide for a practical use of the constant-load test results, theoretical models were developed that predict the behavior of nailed joints under <b>varying</b> <b>loads</b> that are subjected to wood structures in service. Existing models and principles were used to develop five new general models, all of which account for the nonlinear viscous-viscoelastic behavior of nailed joints. The models incorporated the modified superposition principle and strain hardening principle. Heaviside function and Fourier series were also incorporated to describe <b>varying</b> <b>loads</b> that can be either discrete or mathematically defined continuous function. To develop experimental data needed for the formulation and verification of the models developed, joints made of Douglas-fir lumber, plywood and 6 d nails were tested under four constant and four <b>varying</b> <b>loads.</b> The experimental data for constant loads were used to formulate specific theoretical models which were further modified for <b>varying</b> <b>loads.</b> The comparison between the predicted and the corresponding test results shows a very good agreement for all the specific models. The models that include the modified superposition principle are the most accurate and the simplest to apply to nailed joints under discrete load functions. Fourier series representation of varying-load functions shows a great potential for practical applications, because it can represent the service loads more accurately than the discrete approximation. The specific models presented are limited {{to the type of}} joints used in this investigation. Other types of joints need to be tested under constant loads to develop appropriate equations that describe their creep behavior under <b>varying</b> <b>loads...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{vibration}} attenuation of a beam with {{circular cross-section}} by resonantly shunted piezo-elastic supports is experimentally investigated for varying axial tensile and compressive beam <b>loads.</b> <b>Varying</b> axial beam <b>loads</b> manipulate the effective lateral bending stiffness and, thus, {{lead to a}} detuning of the beams resonance frequencies. Furthermore, <b>varying</b> axial <b>loads</b> affect the general electromechanical coupling coefficient of transducer and beam, an important modal quantity for shunt-damping. The beam’s first mode resonance frequency and coupling coefficient are analyzed for <b>varying</b> axial <b>loads.</b> The values of the resonance frequency and the coupling coefficient are obtained from a transducer impedance measurement. Finally, frequency transfer functions of the beam with one piezo-elastic support either shunted to a RL-shunt or to a RL-shunt with negative capacitance, the RLC-shunt, are compared for <b>varying</b> axial <b>loads.</b> It is shown that the beam vibration attenuation with the RLC-shunt is less influenced by <b>varying</b> axial beam <b>loads...</b>|$|R
