5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} functions of ribs and diaphragm, is the change in volume of thorax that helps inspiration and expiration. In general, the ribs move around two axes. The anterior end of the rib is lower than the posterior end, therefore, during elevation of the rib, the anterior end also moves forwards. Movement at costovertebral joints 2 to 6 about a side-to-side axis results in raising and lowering the sternal end of the rib, the [...] "pump-handle" [...] movement.This occurs mostly in the <b>vertebrosternal</b> <b>ribs.</b> In elevation, this increases the anteroposterior diameter of the thorax.|$|E
5000|$|Humans have 24 ribs (12 pairs). The {{first seven}} sets of ribs, known as [...] "true ribs" [...] (costae verae) {{also known as}} <b>vertebrosternal</b> <b>ribs,</b> are {{directly}} attached to the sternum through the costal cartilage. Rib 1 is unique and harder to distinguish than other ribs. It is a short, flat, C-shaped bone. The vertebral attachment can be found just below the neck {{and the majority of}} this bone can be found above the level of the clavicle. Ribs 2 through 7 have a more traditional appearance and become longer and less curved as they progress downwards. [...] The following five sets are known as [...] "false ribs" [...] (costae spuriae), three of these sharing a common cartilaginous connection to the sternum, while the last two (eleventh and twelfth ribs) are termed floating ribs (costae fluctuantes) or vertebral ribs. They are attached to the vertebrae only, and not to the sternum or cartilage coming off of the sternum. Some people lack one of the two pairs of floating ribs, while others have a third pair.|$|E
50|$|The terms true {{and false}} rib {{describe}} rib pairs that are {{directly or indirectly}} attached to the sternum. The phrase true rib (costae verae), or fixed rib, refers to the first seven, or <b>vertebrosternal,</b> <b>rib</b> pairs. The phrase false rib (costae spuriae), or vertebrochondral ribs refers to the eighth-to-twelfth pairs of ribs. The eighth-to-tenth pairs of ribs connect to the sternum indirectly via the costal cartilages of the ribs above them. Their elasticity allows ribcage movement for respiratory activity.|$|R
