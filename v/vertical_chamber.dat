25|$|Woodpeckers {{use their}} chisel-like bills to {{excavate}} their cavity nests, {{a process which}} takes, on average, about two weeks. Cavities are normally excavated on the downward-facing side of a branch, presumably {{to make it more}} difficult for predators to access the nest, and to reduce the chance that rain floods the nest. There is also some evidence that fungal rot may make the wood on the underside of leaning trunks and branches easier to excavate. Most woodpeckers use a cavity for only a single year. The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker is an exception; it takes far longer—up to two years—to excavate its nest cavity, and may reuse it for more than two decades. The typical woodpecker nest has a short horizontal tunnel which leads to a <b>vertical</b> <b>chamber</b> within the trunk. The size and shape of the chamber depends on species, and the entrance hole is typically only as large as is needed to allow access for the adult birds. While wood chips are removed during the excavation process, most species line the floor of the cavity with a fresh bed of them before laying their eggs.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current {{experiment}} is to make direct comparisons between the arcing results obtained from the diffusion pumped <b>vertical</b> <b>chamber</b> and our newly renovated Teney vacuum chamber which is equipped with a cryogenic pump. Recall that the prior reported results obtained for the <b>Vertical</b> <b>chamber</b> were nominal at best, showing only a slight reduction in the arc rate after 5 heating cycles at the lower bias potentials and virtually no changes at high potential biases. It was concluded that the <b>vertical</b> <b>chamber</b> was unable to remove enough water vapor from the chamber to adequately test the arcing criterion. Because the cryo-pumped Teney chamber has a ten times better pumping speed, (40, 000 liters per sec compared to 4, 000 liters per sec for the diffusion pumped <b>vertical</b> <b>chamber),</b> a decision was made to retest that experiment in both the Teney and Vertical vacuum chambers.
