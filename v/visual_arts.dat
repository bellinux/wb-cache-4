40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Education: <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> Education in the Faculty of Education at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2012 This thesis investigates the factors, specifically the constraints, that influence the choices intermediate phase teachers make when planning <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> lessons. The study is also concerned with how teachers deal with factors that they identify as constraints to teaching <b>visual</b> <b>art.</b> The study is framed within an interpretive framework and the work on teacher knowledge by Shulman (1986; 1987). Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} four class teachers, three Arts and Culture teachers, and four <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teachers using a phenomenological methodology. Interviews were analysed systematically by indexing and organizing the data using the knowledge base for teaching as described by Shulman (1987) and Turner-Bisset (1999). The patterns in what teachers consider when planning <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> lessons, and their reasons for doing so, was better explained by a teacher’s training in <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> education rather than his/her role as a class, Arts and Culture, or <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teacher. In this study, the teachers who are trained in <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> education generally work in situations with few contextual problems and their focus, when lesson-planning, centres around the best way <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> content knowledge can be integrated into lessons. In comparison, most of the teachers who are not trained in <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> education mentioned numerous contextual problems that affected their ability to teach <b>visual</b> <b>art.</b> These teachers plan their <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> lessons around what they believe they are able to manage {{within the context of the}} school they are working in, rather than specific <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> related outcomes. In addition, their lesson-planning decisions are generally based on limited <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> content knowledge and pedagogy. Hence, compared to teachers trained to teach <b>visual</b> <b>art,</b> their application of <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> content knowledge is haphazard and does not build on the foundation of the curriculum. Limited contact time and support from management are two contextual factors that were found to impact the way teachers in this study plan <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> lessons. To mitigate for the lack of contact time, the teachers trained in <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> education endeavoured to manage their lesson time efficiently and to setup clear routines with their learners so as to minimize the amount of time spent on non-learning activities...|$|R

40|$|This article offers {{findings}} from research that examined the <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> beliefs and pedagogy {{of early childhood}} educators and supports reflection about the educational merit {{of different types of}} <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> experience offered to children. The range of <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> experiences typically delivered in early childhood education settings varies significantly in method and purpose, yet there is little guidance to support early childhood educators to evaluate the <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> experiences they include in the curriculum or to consider their role as art educators. At the same time, the research literature suggests that pre- school educators lack confidence to make and teach art and that their <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> subject knowledge is limited. Qualitative case study research examined the <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> beliefs and pedagogy of twelve educators located in four Australian early childhood education settings. Data collection methods included interviews, environmental audits and analysis of pedagogical documentation about <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> provisions. John Dewey 2 ̆ 7 s philosophies of democracy, education and art synthesised with the philosophy and pedagogical values of the Reggio Emilia educational approach support interpretation and analysis of the research data. In particular, Dewey 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy of consummatory experience and growth alongside Eisner 2 ̆ 7 s discussions about <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> myths and null curricula guide reflection about <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> provisions in early childhood contexts. A continuum of <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> experience is proposed to support reflection about the types of experience that potentially mis- educate and lead to <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> stagnation compared with experiences that may foster consummatory and educative growth...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{perceptions}} of four <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teacher educators of what constitutes good <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teaching in a Malaysian higher education setting. The {{aim of this study}} is to deepen our understanding of the characteristic features of good <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teaching in a higher education setting. The study explores the beliefs, values, and life shaping factors that underpin and inform the teaching practice of these <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teacher educators. What constitutes good visual teaching in higher education has intrigued and challenged those concerned with this sector for many decades and is subject to on-going inquiry and debate. Perspectives of what constitutes good <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teaching practices are shaped by individual, social and cultural factors, including those pathways taken through <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> education and training. Consequently there is little consensus about what good <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teaching really looks like. Whilst the characteristic features of good teaching in higher education have been the subject of recent inquiry, the literature concerning good <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teaching in higher education is limited. This study aims to address this gap. This study adopts a qualitative case study approach and draws on the principles and practices of narrative inquiry. In this study, four <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teacher educators who have different backgrounds and areas of specialisation from the Art Department of the 'University of Education Malaysia' were interviewed and observed. Each <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teacher educator participated in a series of three interviews in order to interrogate their beliefs, values and experiences, and access their accounts of good <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teaching. Observations of each <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teacher educator's teaching served to triangulate the data generated through interview. In order to obtain a better understanding of the phenomenon, 12 student teachers consisting of six pre-service and six in-service final year student teachers from the same department were interviewed using individual and group interview. Narrative analysis and analysis of narrative techniques were employed in the examination of the data. From this analysis four narrative accounts of these <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teacher educators' perception of good <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teaching in a higher education setting were developed. Findings suggest that teaching is shaped by prior experiences as learners in school, community, and tertiary settings, and understandings of the professional teaching situation. For these participants the personal and professional are connected in their lives. This connection is illustrated through the distinctive ways that each <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teacher educator approaches their teaching and the different beliefs and values they hold. For those participants whose education and/or current practice is studio-based, mastery of art skills and knowledge is of primary importance in good <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teaching. For these participants good <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teaching is a specialised area which requires specific knowledge and skills. For those participants whose education and/or current practice is theory based, good <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teaching is not only about mastery of art skills and knowledge but also involves mastery of pedagogical content knowledge and practical knowledge. Despite these apparent differences in beliefs and practices, concern for pedagogical content knowledge is a feature of the work of all four participants. For all <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teacher educator participants, lifelong learning through self-reflection, inquiry, peer reviewing, involvement in on-going professional development and continuing education is a hallmark of good <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teaching. In addition all <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teacher educator participants view good <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teaching as a relational activity. This study provides us with insights into the complexity of good <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teaching from the perspective of the <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teacher educator. This study has developed ways to listen to <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teacher educators' voices and to hear them in their own terms, to observe them, to enter their realities, and to see the world from their perspectives. This is deemed as important because in the Malaysian experience, more often than not, <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teacher educators' teaching practice and their lives have been largely unexamined and taken for granted. The worldviews, stories, and teaching practices we enact are cultural constructions that have become part of the fabric of our everyday lives. Through this study an understanding of the beliefs, values and life-shaping factors that underpin and inform these <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> teacher educators' teaching practices provides us with new understandings of their work in Malaysian teacher education...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevailing}} opinion among aestheticians {{is that the}} creative value of <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> is bound by the subjectivity of individual observers. However, {{it is possible to}} construct an objective value scale that can be applied by both individual observers and groups of observers. This paper purports to explain such a scale and to provide a working example for its implementation in current practice. Before this scale is explained, six fundamental terms must be defined to clarify respective functions and their relationships to each other as well as the whole. These terms are <b>visual</b> <b>art,</b> creativity, representation, abstraction, imagination, and conceptualization. The first term, <b>visual</b> <b>art,</b> is a form of art that is perceived and appreciated as art via the sense of sight. Examples of <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> are drawings, paintings, sculptures, and installations. It should be noted that, while the perception of <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> {{is not limited to the}} sense of sight, the sense of sight must play a primary role in artistic perception. The second term, creativity, is defined in reference to <b>visual</b> <b>art.</b> Since creativity alone is the ability to create, visually artistic creativity is the ability to create <b>visual</b> <b>art,</b> which requires that creativity be artistic. To be visually artistic, a creation must be brought into existence via the tools and practices of <b>visual</b> <b>art.</b> Thus, visually artistic creativity is creativity in reference to <b>visual</b> <b>art.</b> Representation in reference to <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> is the quality of creating a visual likeness of visual perception...|$|R
40|$|This {{study reveals}} how a rural and remote school {{community}} conceptualizes senior <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> programs. The study {{was based on}} interviews with students, parents and teachers, these interviews were transcribed and analysed according to the adopted phenomenographic structure. Photographs taken by the participants of the cultural context were included and explained by them {{as a part of the}} interview. The study identified conceptions of place as well as four conceptions of senior <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> programs. The four conceptions focus on cognitive abilities and expression, the enjoyment of practical tasks, employment for girls and the lack of/existence of theory within the <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> programs. The initial impetus for this study was the low number of students electing <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> as a subject in their senior studies at a rural and emote high school. The researcher while teaching <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> in a rural and remote community experienced this trend. The decision making processes in the selection of school subjects became the focus for this research and the vehicle for identifying held conceptions. The reasons for choosing, or not choosing, <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> as a subject revealed the immediate and embedded conceptions of <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> programs that ultimately shape the decision making process. The school community's conceptions of <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> programs focused on the intrinsic and/or extrinsic qualities of senior <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> programs. These conceptions can be applied to better understand and meet the needs of <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> education in a rural and remote cultural context. The findings from this research can be significant to teachers, teacher educators, administrators, curriculum writers and researchers involved in <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> education and rural and remote education. This research has provided insights into the understanding and experiences of <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> education in a rural and remote cultural context. This suggests that further study in this area would be useful to those interested in <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> education in the wider context of rural and remote education...|$|R

40|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> {{has been}} a part of Australian {{education}} for decades; however, in an increasingly globalized visual world where individuals are inundated with media images the need for students to develop the skills to deconstruct and reconstruct images has become vital. And yet the notions that <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> is simply a God-given gift, frill or busy-work activity remain prevalent within our society and the skills that are taught become optional for students at the end of their middle school years. Therefore, educators and researchers alike have the added responsibility to determine students’ understanding of the benefits of <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> and identify ways in which to encourage continued appreciation and involvement in their <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> Education. The purpose of this thesis is to identify possible perceptions Year 7 students at a private college have on <b>Visual</b> <b>Art,</b> the influences that effect student subject selection and the ways their attitudes can inform future planning. The context of the study was an elite independent college in Victoria, Australia. This school currently allows students at the end of Year 7 to discontinue their <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> studies in Year 8. This study approached Year 7 students with the intention of determining whether or not they enjoyed and valued <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> in addition to seeking insight into their attitudes surrounding their <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> classroom learning activities. The study furthermore sought insight into student attitudes concerning the role parents, self-efficacy, peers or dreams for the future played in their decision to continue or discontinue specific subjects. This paper also endeavoured to add to the mounting body of literature on student perceptions by investigating student’s beliefs within a <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> classroom context. It similarly aimed to add to current arts educational research through addressing the gaps that exist in <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> Educational studies, specifically the lack of student opinions. The study attempted this through collating data on Year 7 perceptions from three different instruments. Forty-one students volunteered to participate in an online questionnaire, during their timetabled art class, and provided their thoughts on their classroom experiences, subject selection influences and dreams for the future. Eleven students, who completed the surveys, then offered to attend one of four focus groups interviews that were conducted. These 30 -minute interviews involved the interviewer asking semi-structured questions and prompting discussion with visual stimuli. Four students within the focus group interviews also illustrated how they saw themselves within their <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> classroom. Multiple instruments were created to encourage students to answer honestly and be able to offer in-depth insight into their opinions as well as allow the researcher to triangulate data and increase the validity of the information gathered. It became apparent within the questionnaire, focus group interviews and drawing instruments that students enjoyed <b>Visual</b> <b>Art,</b> looked forward to their <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> class learning experiences and it was a favourite among many. The key struggle students’ highlighted during their classroom experiences concerned time-management. However the data, while suggesting that students liked <b>Visual</b> <b>Art,</b> also noted that the majority of students had dated notions of the purpose of <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> subjects and illustrated that further discussions on the aims of <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> Education in accordance to the new ACARA (2011) documents might be beneficial to implementing the national curriculum. The findings also clarified that <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> was not perceived as an important class and the minority of student participants saw a future in the creative industries. By identifying through the findings and literature framework the role that goals, self-efficacy and mindsets play within subject selection and motivation, as well as the significance of parent influence, the study was able to highlight the growing need for parental involvement in promoting <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> Education, developing a growth mindset and student self-efficacy. The study also implicated the necessity for teachers to promote career pathways in our global and creative economy that are benefited by <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> studies. As a whole the study provides insight into potential actions <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> teachers at a Private College might explore to improve motivation in the <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> classroom and encourage students to elect to continue their studies in <b>Visual</b> <b>Art</b> in the future...|$|R
