5000|$|A <b>volumetric</b> <b>flask</b> (measuring flask or {{graduated}} flask) is a {{piece of}} laboratory glassware, a type of laboratory flask, calibrated to contain a precise volume at a particular temperature. <b>Volumetric</b> <b>flasks</b> are used for precise dilutions and preparation of standard solutions. These flasks are usually pear-shaped, with a flat bottom, and made of glass or plastic. The flask's mouth is either furnished with a plastic snap/screw cap or fitted with a joint to accommodate a PTFE or glass stopper. The neck of the <b>volumetric</b> <b>flasks</b> is elongated and narrow with an etched ring graduation marking. The marking indicates the volume of liquid contained when filled up to that point. The marking is typically calibrated [...] "to contain" [...] (marked [...] "TC" [...] or [...] "IN") at 20 °C and indicated correspondingly on a label. The flask's label also indicates the nominal volume, tolerance, precision class, relevant manufacturing standard and the manufacturer’s logo. The <b>volumetric</b> <b>flasks</b> are of various sizes, containing from 1 to 20 000 mL of liquid.|$|R
