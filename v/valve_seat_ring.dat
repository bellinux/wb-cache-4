50|$|The {{general design}} of voice {{prosthesis}} is quite consistent, {{even though there}} are unique characteristics. A voice prosthesis has retaining flanges at each end, the ‘tracheal flange’ and ‘esophageal flange’. Those flanges can vary in size and rigidity, e.g. indwelling prostheses have larger and more rigid flanges for stability and facilitate long-term placement. The flange near the food pipe (esophageal flange) is more rigid than the tracheal flange, near the windpipe. The one-way valve can be molded in one piece with the prosthesis and is often supported by a fluoroplastic <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> (a colored <b>ring</b> that is tightly secured into the shaft of the prosthesis, adding rigidity and which is radiopaque). All voice prostheses have a safety strap, which is cut off in indwelling devices after the prosthesis is put in place; in non-indwelling devices the strap is not removed and is taped to the neck. A voice prosthesis has a one-way valve near the esophageal flange that enables pulmonary air to pass into the esophagus and pharynx for sound production and prevents content from the food pipe, such as liquids or saliva, from entering the trachea.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} metal joining for {{cladding}} is largely {{used in many}} process industries. Plasma transferred arc welding (PTAW) is accurate, and is easily available, with very low dilution and high volume of production. Computation of process equations by PTAW to predict the weld bead geometry is largely used in automatic PTAW. A five factor, five level technique used {{for the development of}} mathematical equations for the predicting the weld bead geometry for cladding SS 410 L (Cr-Si-Ni) onto carbon <b>seat</b> <b>valve</b> <b>rings</b> (ASTM A 105) and is presented. The sufficiency and significance of the developed models by F test and t test have been checked respectively. To achieve the desired quality of overlay, the main and interaction effects of the control factors on dilution and bead geometry is presented. The mathematical model and the results obtained were optimized with conformity test. The artificial neural network model was developed to optimize the amount of metal deposited with regards to dilution...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} ways in which a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> may be {{improperly}} positioned or machined. These include incomplete seating during the press fitting-step, distortion of the nominally circular <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> surfaces such they deviate unacceptably from perfect roundness or waviness, tilt of the machined surfaces relative to the valve guide hole axis, deviation of the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> surfaces from concentricity with the valve guide holes, and deviation of the machined conical section of the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> from the cone angle that is required to match the valve surface. Automated quality control of inserted and machined <b>valve</b> <b>seats</b> has traditionally been very difficult to achieve until the advent of digital holography which has enabled high-definition metrology for measuring all of these listed deviations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{problem with the}} CVH is the {{tendency}} to drop a <b>valve</b> <b>seat,</b> which most often happens in vin number P engines, due to the steel PM <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> inserts in the aluminum head. (the 2000-2004 Ford Focus with the 2.0L CVH/SPI SOHC engine and also seen in 1991-2002 Ford Escorts). These engines usually drop a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> with no warning, even if the engine has been well maintained. In most cases, a seat drops on the number 4 cylinder, with the next most common being the number 2 cylinder (this peculiarity {{may have something to}} do with the engines secondary harmonics) [...] With the factory <b>valve</b> <b>seats,</b> the typical life of the 2.0L SPI in a Focus is about 100 to 120k miles, but it can happen as early as 70k miles. When the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> drops out of the cylinder head, it falls into the cylinder and damages the piston and cylinder head. In some cases, the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> is drawn from its cylinder through the intake manifold into another cylinder until it is obliterated. A <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> dropping into the cylinder can scar the cylinder wall and bend the piston connecting rods.|$|R
40|$|<b>Valve</b> <b>seat</b> inserts {{are one of}} {{the vital}} part of the valve train in {{internal}} combustion engines, as they are the interface between the valve and the cylinder head. <b>Valve</b> and <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> embeds together serve to seal off the combustion chamber regulating the inlet and exhaust gases. The <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> insert avoids immediate contact of the valve with the cylinder head and absorbs part of the combustion heat which is transfered to the valve by passing it on to the cylinder head. Therefore, misalignment of the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> during manufacturing could result in engine failure. This project proposes a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> insert misalignment measurement using the concept of eddy current inspection method. Eddy current inspection method permit flaw detection in a large variety of conductive materials, either ferromagnetic or non-ferromagnetic. Simulation to study the change in induced current density and magnetic density around the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> and cylinder head due to the magnetic field generated by an exciting coil was conduct using COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 4.
