In a pot experiment, we measured the leaf SPAD value (i. e. an estimate of leaf chlorophyll concentration) of lupin and strawberry sequentially grown on a soil–sand mixture previously flooded for 30 days (SPADf value) and on a non-flooded (control) mixture (SPADc value). The amount of Fe 2 + released by the soil at day 58 {{and the increase in}} oxalate-extractable Fe (Feo) upon incubation in vials were larger on average for the Inceptisols than for the <b>Vertisols.</b> The SPADc values for lupin and strawberry were (i) larger for the <b>Vertisols</b> than for the Inceptisols (probably because the <b>Vertisols</b> contain little carbonate and induce less Fe chlorosis than the Inceptisols) and (ii) correlated with Feo, and with citrate/ascorbate- and DTPA-extractable Fe (Feca, FeDTPA). The SPADf–SPADc difference was (i) much larger for the Inceptisols than for the <b>Vertisols</b> and (ii) correlated with the increases in Feo and Feca caused by flooding and with the amount of Fe 2 + released in the incubation experiment.

Turbation {{may affect the}} chemical and structural composition of the most stabilised fractions of soil organic matter (SOM), i. e., humic substances (HS). The objectives {{of this study were}} to: (1) characterise SOM in two <b>Vertisols</b> (V 1 and V 2) developed under Mediterranean climate in Italy, using some HS characteristics as indicators of SOM turnover in <b>Vertisols,</b> and (2) explore possible differences related to the pedomorphologic conditions of the area under which two soils have formed. SOM evolution along the soil profile was investigated by applying different techniques to chemically extracted HS. Humification parameters, thermal methods, such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetry (TG) together with isoelectric focusing (IEF) were used. The results showed {{a significant difference in the}} chemical characteristics of SOM in the considered <b>Vertisols.</b> A higher amount of total and humified carbon was found in pedon V 2. In particular, the results indicated an accumulation of humified compounds in deeper horizons of V 2 : this effect is particularly significant since both soils were under the same agricultural management and the same climatic conditions, but were different in physiografic position, slope and colour. The higher amount of not humified SOM in the pedon V 1 could explain the differences found in the shape and size of soil structure between the two pedons. The different SOM evolution occurring in the two <b>Vertisols</b> apparently influenced the structure and composition of the HS fraction. Thermal analysis and isoelectric focusing data provided evidence of a different level of stabilisation of HS from the two <b>Vertisols.</b> The HS from pedon V 2 have a higher molecular weight structure, which would imply a higher level of SOM stabilisation. Conversely, HS in the pedon V 1 appeared to be richer in aliphatic and phenolic structures, which may imply the presence of less stabilised HS fractions. These findings agree well with the different water dynamics occurring in the two sites, which confirmed the influence exerted by water on chemical and structural composition of HS and, consequently, their effect in determining <b>Vertisols</b> colour. In conclusion, thermal and isoelectric focusing characterisation of HS appear to shed some light in understanding the structural complexity of <b>Vertisols.</b> The results obtained in the present study, if confirmed on a larger number of <b>Vertisols,</b> suggest the possibility of using HS as indicators of SOM turnover in relation to pedomorphology, use and management of soils...|$|R

The success of the DRS approach relies {{on the ability of}} the data mining algorithms to extract appropriate spectral features while accounting for non-linearity and complexity of the reflectance spectra. There is no comparative assessment of spectral algorithms for estimating nutrient content of Indian soils. We compare the performance of partialleast-squares regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) and their combinations (DWT–PLSR and DWT–SVR) to estimate soil nutrient content. The DRS models were generated for extractable phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulphur (S), boron (B), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) content in <b>Vertisols</b> and Alfisols and were compared using residual prediction deviation (RPD) of validation dataset. The best DRS models yielded accurate predictions for P (RPD = 2. 27), Fe (RPD = 2. 91) in <b>Vertisols</b> and Fe (RPD = 2. 43) in Alfisols, while B (RPD = 1. 63), Zn (RPD = 1. 49) in <b>Vertisols</b> and K (RPD = 1. 89), Zn (RPD = 1. 41) in Alfisols were predicted with moderate accuracy. The DWT–SVR outperformed all other approaches in case of P, K and Fe in <b>Vertisols</b> and P, K and Zn in Alfisols; whereas the PLSR approach was better for B, Zn and Al in <b>Vertisols</b> and B, Fe and Al in Alfisols.
