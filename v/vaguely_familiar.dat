5|$|To begin with, {{every one}} must buy this {{book for the}} {{following}} aesthetic reasons: First, because I know where there is the cutest cloth of gold dress for only $300 in a store on Forty-second Street, and, also, if enough people buy it {{where there is a}} platinum ring with a complete circlet, and, also, if loads of people buy it my husband needs a new winter overcoat, although the one he has done well enough for the last three years... It seems to me that on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage, and, also, scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar.</b> In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe that is how he spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.|$|E
25|$|Though not {{appearing}} in Tekken 7s original arcade release, Nina returns in its updated title, Tekken 7: Fated Retribution. In the story mode, {{she was forced}} to work for the returning Heihachi in the first-half, until she began to concern about Lars' good reason on keeping Jin safe with him, deeming it very interesting to watch and resign from Zaibatsu, faking her death while setting her private assassination job for hire. She is later tasked with infiltrating a mafia wedding... posing as the bride. During the ceremony, a firefight broke out where Nina took out all her targets. However, the commotion had attracted the Tekken Force, who had been dispatched to suppress the violence, and they gave chase. With the Tekken Force in hot pursuit, Nina made her escape. That's when she bumped into a man she found <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar,</b> who happens to be her son, Steve Fox. Steve wouldn't leave her alone. He seemed to have something he wanted to say to her... Nina decided that a confrontation was her best chance of escape.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Hung Up" [...] is a dance-pop and disco song. According to The New York Times, {{the song}} has <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> hooks, {{sustained}} overlays of the string arrangement and acoustic guitar enfolding {{the music to}} create a haze like sound. Billboard described the music as frothy, nonsensical and joyous. The instant familiarity of the sampled music is changed by Stuart Price and Madonna by adding a chugging groove and a chorus which singles it out as an independent song. Besides the ABBA sample, Rolling Stone said that the song also incorporated Madonna's older songs like [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Holiday" [...] and features fleeting quotes from bands like S.O.S. and the Tom Tom Club.|$|E
60|$|How could I {{know what}} eyes {{might not be}} {{regarding}} me from bowers as thick and secluded as these? Yet this seemed an isle in some <b>vague</b> fashion <b>familiar</b> to me. To these same watery steps of stone, to this same mooring-ring surely I had voyaged before in dream or other life? I glanced {{into the water and}} saw my own fantastic image beneath the reflected gloom of cypresses, and knew at least, though I a shadow might be, this also was an island in a sea of shadows. Far from all land its marbles might be reared, yet they were warm to my touch, and these were nightingales, and those strutting doves beneath the little arches.|$|R
60|$|He arose, {{but instead}} of falling on his knees {{he went to the}} window and lifted his face to the {{whitening}} sky.... Slowly out of the obscurity of the earth's shadow emerged the <b>vague</b> outlines of <b>familiar</b> things until they stood sharply material, in a silence as of death. A sparrow twittered, and suddenly the familiar, soot-grimed roofs were bathed in light, and by a touch made beautiful....|$|R
60|$|Crossing {{my hands}} before me, I now stood without speaking. For {{the soul of}} me, I could not link this mysterious {{creature}} with the tawny strangers. She seemed of another race. So powerful was this impression, that unconsciously, I addressed her in my own tongue. She started, and bending over, listened intently, as if to the first faint echo of something dimly remembered. Again I spoke, when throwing back her hair, the maiden looked up with a piercing, bewildered gaze. But her eyes soon fell, and bending over once more, she resumed her former attitude. At length she slowly chanted to herself several musical words, unlike those of the Islanders; but though I knew not what they meant, they <b>vaguely</b> seemed <b>familiar.</b>|$|R
500|$|West {{retracted}} much of {{the rich}} live instrumentation that had characterized his previous studio album Late Registration. He had them replaced with heavy, layered electronic synthesizers with Gothic tendencies at loud volumes throughout Graduation. West injected distorted synth-chords, house beats, electro-disco rhythms, and {{a wide array of}} audio-effects into his articulate hip-hop production. All the while, West buried his signature kicks and snares deep beneath the decomposing layers of synths {{into the bottom of the}} mix. Graduation contains an eclectic variety of <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> samples that were artfully manipulated by West. Though he continues to use vocal samples, West now gleans them before also pushing them underneath the synths, causing them to [...] "sound like voices trapped in a huge machine, not like organic, subliminal connections to a mythical black-music past." [...] As always is the case with his productions, West neither relies nor settles simply on samples alone. Instead, there lies a discernible sense of multi-layered grandeur evident within each track. Even in new, unfamiliar musical surroundings, West retains both his self-assurance as well as his close attention to sonic detail. Hence, the album contains a plethora of random, semi-audible sounds that are challenging to notice during the first few listens. The sounds range from keyboard arpeggios to crowd cheers to hard rock guitars and act as a supplement for the atypical samples and the layered electronic synths. West filled the corners of Graduation with enough subtle instrumental flourishes and studio embellishments to warrant a repeated, close, and careful listening experience. According to Ann Powers from the Los Angeles Times, the album's subtly dark tone was a byproduct of the inevitable toll placed on West as an artist, [...] "an innovator in a genre that he must at least partially destroy to renew", torn between his devotion to hip-hop tradition and his [...] "restless artistic drive": ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, 2008, Michael Moore was a {{guest on}} Larry King Live and was shown a clip from the film where Malone (while lying down on his bed, {{drinking}} a Big Gulp and watching archival footage of JFK's inaugural address) is startled by Kennedy, who materializes out of Malone's television screen, and confronts him on his misguided views of American history. Moore {{said that he was}} <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> with the film, and then jokingly said he thought that Viggo Mortensen should be portraying him. When King asked him his opinion, Moore shrugged and said, [...] "I hope it's funny." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cappon {{was known}} for his {{conservatism}} as a coach. [...] In 23 years at Princeton, the uniforms never changed, having small sewn-on numbers and no player names. [...] He considered a fast break as a lack of discipline and would not allow his players to shoot before five or ten passes had been completed. [...] In 1995, former Princeton player Selden Edwards wrote an article on Cappon's influence at Princeton. [...] Edwards, a junior varsity player in the Cappon era, wrote that [...] "Cappy was Princeton basketball to anyone even <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> with the teams of that era." [...] Edwards described Cappon's physical appearance this way: [...] "In 1959, the fall I arrived at Princeton, Cappy was in peak form, a character who knew he was a character. He was in his early sixties, and his body {{looked as if it had}} been sculpted in ice cream and left in the sun. He was bald, the skin on his face drooped, he had deep shadows under his eyes. His voice was gravelly, and he enunciated as if he had wads of Kleenex in his mouth. He always said exactly what he meant, and his language was delightfully salty. Legend had it that he had been a great athlete at Michigan, but by the 1960s no one could imagine that. He was grumpily personable and totally without pretension." ...|$|E
5000|$|The episode {{received}} a 2.6 rating and was watched by {{a total of}} 5.14 million people, making it the most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating Bob's Burgers, American Dad! and The Simpsons with 5.06 million. The episode was met with positive reviews from critics. Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, saying [...] "The pace of “Joe’s Revenge” felt right, and that was enough to showcase some very funny jokes (Stewie leaving Goober with a babysitter Barbie!!), glide over some terrible ones (South America breaking away from Africa because of black people? What the HELL?), and redeem some questionable ones (Quagmire’s illegitimate stripper twins…!). When it hits the sweet spot, it can take you right over the weird parts and deliver you to a <b>vague</b> but <b>familiar</b> conclusion. Can’t ask for much more than that." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cattelan’s {{manipulation}} of photos and his publications of magazine compilations such as Permanent Food and Charley {{did not come}} about without their influences. The artist attributes his love of finding the uncanny, the silly, or the seductive in just about any mundane or sensational object, as traceable to the works of Andy Warhol. As Cattelan states, “That’s probably the greatest thing about Warhol: the way he penetrated and summarized our world, {{to the point that}} distinguishing between him and our everyday life is basically impossible, and in any case useless.” Permanent Food and Charley differ in sophistication. Both consist of crude layouts, having magazine pages compiled together torn from outside sources. The latter, however, was backed by a wide list of recognizable and credible curators. His most recent publication, Toilet Paper, differs greatly from the two previously mentioned, as its photographs were originally planned and designated solely for the magazine. The level of originality for this magazine surpassed the others, providing the audience <b>vague,</b> oddly <b>familiar</b> photographs to peruse through. Toilet Paper is a surrealist pantomime of images that the viewer cannot easily trace back to a starting point, while they’ve most likely been conjured by popular culture. It is a whirlwind of loud colors mixed in with the occasional black-and-white photo: “the pictures probe the unconscious, tapping into sublimated perversions and spasms of violence.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm {{very glad}} to hear it, Miss Oswald, I assure you. But I'm only a {{beginner}} and a trifler yet. Some day I mean to produce {{something that will be}} worth listening to. Only, do you remember what some French novelist once said?--"A poet's sweetest poem is always the one he has never been able to compose." [...] I often think that's true of music, too. Away up in the higher stories of one's brain somewhere, there's a tune floating about, or rather a whole oratorio full of them, that one can never catch and fix upon ruled paper. The idea's there, such a beautiful and <b>vague</b> idea, so <b>familiar</b> to one, but so utterly unrealisable on any known instrument--a sort of musical Ariel, flitting before one and tantalising one for ever, but never allowing one to come up with it and see its real features. I'm always dissatisfied with what I've actually written, and longing to crystallise into a score the imaginary airs I can never catch. Except in this last piece of mine; that's the only thing I've ever done that thoroughly and completely pleases me. Come and see me next week, and I'll play it over to you.' ...|$|R
60|$|Francis {{looked at}} him in surprise. The man was evidently agitated. Somehow or other, his face was <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{door-bell}} rang. He {{answered it}} a little impatiently. A slim, fashionably dressed young Frenchman stood there, whose face was <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> to him.|$|E
60|$|Her voice, {{with the}} slight {{warmth of the}} Western accent, had an almost thrilling quality. It seemed <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> to Tommy, but he thrust the {{impression}} aside as impossible.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I had immense plans,' {{he muttered}} irresolutely. 'Yes,' said I; 'but {{if you try}} to shout I'll smash your head with--' There was not a stick or a stone near. 'I will {{throttle}} you for good,' I corrected myself. 'I was on the threshold of great things,' he pleaded, in a voice of longing, with a wistfulness of tone that made my blood run cold. 'And now for this stupid scoundrel--' 'Your success in Europe is assured in any case,' I affirmed steadily. I did not want to have the throttling of him, you understand--and indeed {{it would have been very}} little use for any practical purpose. I tried to break the spell--the heavy, mute spell of the wilderness--that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by the awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts, by the memory of gratified and monstrous passions. This alone, I was convinced, had driven him out to the edge of the forest, to the bush, towards the gleam of fires, the throb of drums, the drone of weird incantations; this alone had beguiled his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of permitted aspirations. And, don't you see, the terror of the position was not in being knocked on the head--though I had a very lively sense of that danger, too--but in this, that I had to deal with a being to whom I could not appeal in the name of anything high or low. I had, even like the niggers, to invoke him--himself--his own exalted and incredible degradation. There was nothing either above or below him, and I knew it. He had kicked himself loose of the earth. Confound the man! he had kicked the very earth to pieces. He was alone, and I before him did not know whether I stood on the ground or floated in the air. I've been telling you what we said--repeating the phrases we pronounced--but what's the good? They were common everyday words--the <b>familiar,</b> <b>vague</b> sounds exchanged on every waking day of life. But what of that? They had behind them, to my mind, the terrific suggestiveness of words heard in dreams, of phrases spoken in nightmares. Soul! If anybody ever struggled with a soul, I am the man. And I wasn't arguing with a lunatic either. Believe me or not, his intelligence was perfectly clear--concentrated, it is true, upon himself with horrible intensity, yet clear; and therein was my only chance--barring, of course, the killing him there and then, which wasn't so good, on account of unavoidable noise. But his soul was mad. Being alone in the wilderness, it had looked within itself, and, by heavens! I tell you, it had gone mad. I had--for my sins, I suppose--to go through the ordeal of looking into it myself. No eloquence could have been so withering to one's belief in mankind as his final burst of sincerity. He struggled with himself, too. I saw it--I heard it. I saw the inconceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint, no faith, and no fear, yet struggling blindly with itself. I kept my head pretty well; but when I had him at last stretched on the couch, I wiped my forehead, while my legs shook under me as though I had carried half a ton on my back down that hill. And yet I had only supported him, his bony arm clasped round my neck--and he was not much heavier than a child.|$|R
6000|$|Maud Barrington made {{a curious}} little gesture. [...] "I knew I {{had seen it}} before at the bridge, {{but that was not}} all. It was <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar,</b> and I felt I ought to know it. It {{reminded}} me of somebody." ...|$|E
60|$|Cecily did not {{recognize}} him, yet there was something <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> about him. She walked rapidly up to the house. In the sitting-room she found Lucy Ellen peering out between the muslin window curtains. When the latter turned there was an air of repressed excitement about her.|$|E
60|$|Two knocks {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} on the door below. The first man was quite unknown to Tommy, who put him down as a city clerk. A quiet, intelligent-looking man, rather shabbily dressed. The second was of the working classes, {{and his face was}} <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> to the young man.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{a glimpse}} of it. It was an {{ordinary}} face enough; in fact, it disappointed me a little. But the odd {{part of it was}} that it seemed <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> to me. I have seen it before, often. Yet, try as I will, I cannot recollect where, or under what circumstances." ...|$|E
60|$|An {{announcement}} that fairly took away Honora's breath. She managed {{to express her}} appreciation of Mrs. Grainger's intention, and presently found herself walking rapidly up-town through swirling snow, somewhat dazed {{by the events of}} the afternoon. And these, by the way, were not yet finished. As she reached her own door, a voice <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> called her name.|$|E
60|$|She did not {{recognise}} the voice, {{even though}} there was something <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> in its intonation. Yvonne did not pause to conjecture: she had been made happy by the very sound of the language which stood to her for every word of love she had ever heard: it restored her courage and her confidence in their fullest measure.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is strange}} {{that you should}} ask that," [...] he said. [...] "Sometimes, {{especially}} when I have come upon him alone, or have seen him excited, his tone and little mannerisms have seemed somehow <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar.</b> And yet," [...] he added thoughtfully, [...] "I {{have never been able}} to recall of whom they have reminded me." ...|$|E
60|$|She sped to {{the door}} of the anteroom, and pulling it wide stood breathlessly to listen. But the voice that floated up to her was not the voice she so desperately hoped to hear. It was a woman's voice asking in urgent tones for M. Andre-Louis--a voice at first <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar,</b> then clearly recognized, the voice of Mme. de Plougastel.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{something}} <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> {{to her in}} the voice of this Miss Bygrave, and, at the same time, in unaccountable contradiction, something strange to her as well. The face and figure of the young lady were entirely new to her. It was a striking face, and a striking figure; and if she had seen either at any former period, she would certainly have remembered it. Miss Bygrave was unquestionably a stranger; and yet-- ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had driven}} {{for about a}} week when, upon coming into the barn after {{completing}} his morning delivery, he was instructed to take a special order to a certain address on Lake Shore Drive. Although the address was not that of one of his regular customers he felt that there was something <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> about it, but when he finally arrived he realized that it was a residence at which he had never before called.|$|E
60|$|Tallente {{looked at}} his guest thoughtfully. She was pouring out tea from an {{ordinary}} brown earthenware pot {{with an air of}} complete absorption in her task. The friendliness of her seemed somehow to warm the atmosphere of the room, even as her sympathy had stolen into the frozen places of his life. For the moment he ignored her question. His eyes appraised her critically, reminiscently. There was something <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> in the frank sweetness of her tone and manner.|$|E
60|$|Francis {{did as he}} was bidden. The {{girl was}} a {{well-known}} member of the chorus of one of the principal musical comedies, and she seemed to be thoroughly enjoying both the dance and her partner. The latter appeared to be of a somewhat ordinary type, sallow, with rather puffy cheeks, and eyes almost unnaturally dark. He danced vigorously and he talked all the time. Something about him was <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> to Francis, but he failed to place him.|$|E
6000|$|Norgate {{was looking}} {{across the street to}} the other side of the pavement. A man was {{standing}} there, engaged in conversation with a plainly-dressed young woman. To Norgate there was something <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> about the latter, who turned to glance at him as they strolled by on the other side of the road. It was not until they reached the corner of the street, however, that he remembered. She was the young woman at the telephone call office near Westbourne Grove! ...|$|E
60|$|Tavernake, who {{had been}} on the point of striding away, turned sharply around. The man who had spoken to him was wearing morning clothes of dark gray tweed and a soft Homburg hat. His {{complexion}} was a little sallow and he was clean-shaven except for a slight black moustache. He was smoking a black cigar and his accent was transatlantic. Something about his appearance struck Tavernake as being <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar,</b> but he could not at first recall where he had seen him before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be welcome {{aboard the}} Cinco Llagas, Colonel, darling," [...] a voice <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> {{addressed}} the planter. [...] "We've {{made the best}} of the Spaniards' wardrobe in honour of this visit, though it was scarcely yourself we had dared hope to expect. You find yourself among friends--old friends of yours, all." [...] The Colonel stared in stupefaction. Mr. Blood tricked out in all this splendour--indulging therein his natural taste--his face carefully shaven, his hair as carefully dressed, seemed transformed into a younger man. The fact is he looked no more than the thirty-three years he counted to his age.|$|E
60|$|Tarzan {{smiled and}} moved away. As {{he was leaving}} the little group about {{headquarters}} he passed a small figure wrapped in an officer's heavy overcoat. The collar was turned up and the visor of the military cap pulled well down over the eyes; but, as the ape-man passed, {{the light from the}} fire illuminated the features of the newcomer for an instant, revealing to Tarzan a <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> face. Some officer he had known in London, doubtless, he surmised, and went his way through the British camp and the British lines all unknown to the watchful sentinels of the out-guard.|$|E
60|$|Graham's {{knees were}} shaking, but with Lutchester's help he {{staggered}} up and reached his side. On the pavement below {{a man in}} chauffeur's livery was standing, holding out his hands, and {{by the side of}} the curbstone a closed car was waiting. Somehow or other the two reached the pavement. Lutchester almost pushed his companion into the limousine and stepped in after him. The chauffeur sprang to his seat and the car glided off. Graham just realised that there was a woman by his side whose face was <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar.</b> Then the waves broke in upon his ears once more.|$|E
60|$|Wolfenden, {{in common}} with most of his fellow-countrymen, could {{scarcely}} believe his eyes; yet there it was in plain black and white. The dogs of war had been called back. Germany was climbing down--not with dignity; she {{had gone too far}} for that--but with a scuffle. Wolfenden read the paper through before he even thought of his letters Then he began to open them slowly. The first was from his mother. The Admiral was distinctly better; the doctors were more hopeful. He turned to the next one; it was in a delicate, foreign handwriting, and exhaled a faint perfume which seemed <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar</b> to him. He opened it and his heart stood still.|$|E
60|$|He {{threw himself}} at last {{into a corner}} seat of his compartment, and {{conscious}} of a somewhat rare physical exhaustion, he rang the bell for the attendant and ordered refreshments. The evening papers were by his side, {{but he had no}} fancy to read. The thrill of the last few hours was still upon him. He sat with folded arms, looking idly through the window at the chaotic prospect. Suddenly he was aware that the door of his compartment had been opened. A man had entered and was taking the seat opposite to him, a man whose appearance struck Maraton at once as being <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar,</b> a man who smiled at him almost with the air of an old acquaintance.|$|E
60|$|The {{only other}} {{occupant}} of the lift was a striking-looking woman of foreign appearance, {{dressed in a}} way that made Archie feel that she must be somebody or she couldn't look like that. Her face, too, seemed <b>vaguely</b> <b>familiar.</b> She entered the lift at the second floor where the tea-room is, and she had the contented expression of one who had tea'd to her satisfaction. She got off at the same floor as Archie, and walked swiftly, in a lithe, pantherist way, round the bend in the corridor. Archie followed more slowly. When he reached the door of his room, the passage was empty. He inserted the key in his door, turned it, pushed the door open, and pocketed the key. He was about to enter when the bag again squirmed gently in his grip.|$|E
