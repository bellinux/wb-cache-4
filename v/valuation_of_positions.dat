40|$|Our new {{approach}} to mobility measurement involves separating out the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> in terms of individual status (using income, social rank, or other criteria) from the issue of movement between positions. The quantification of movement is addressed using a general concept of distance between positions and a parsimonious set of axioms that characterise the distance concept and yield a class of aggregative indices. This class of indices induces a superclass of mobility measures over the different status concepts consistent with the same underlying data. We investigate the statistical inference of mobility indices using two well-known status concepts, related to income mobility and rank mobility. Mobility measures, axiomatic approach, bootstrap. ...|$|E

The report concluded that in some cases where the use of own funds at book value (OFBV) data would lead to significant biases in the national net i. i. p., other valuation methods than OFBV could be used, adding that national compilers shall exchange information on those positions with the other relevant Member State(s).

40|$|The {{importance}} of the risk-neutral measure as a pricing operator generates interest in the calibration problem: given observed market prices, retrieve a pricing measure compatible with them. It can be established through convex duality arguments that the Arbitrage Pricing Theory calibration problem, i. e. calibartion {{to a set of}} benchmark securities, is equivalent to a certain portfolio optimization problem. We present an explicit duality argument to extend this result: every portfolio optimization problem in a market that allows liquid trading is equivalent to a pricing measure retrieval problem, and vice versa. The resulting pricing measures reflect private <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> investors' <b>positions</b> - a consequence of considering portfolio optimization problem {{from the point of view}} of a hedger endowed with specific goals and liabilities. Such an investor operates in a "sub-market" of available financial securities, which he must see as arbitrage-free, but in which he may be a buyer or seller of particular contingent claims depending on his particular liabilities and goals. This perspective shifts our vision of arbitrage pricing from a "global" to a "local" market, i. e. to the one seen by an investor through the prism of his particular portfolio. It also allows us to use microeconomic considerations when choosing a calibration utility...|$|R

The pervasive use of this financial instrument in managing interest rate and currency risks not only in America and Europe, but also in Asia, has implied a large swap book in most banks and in increasing attention paid to the risk <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> such swap <b>positions.</b> In Asia, however, swap rates for contracts with tenors or maturities below five years are not as liquid as exchange traded Eurodollar futures. Therefore, Eurodollar futures prices are used to estimate forward positions traded in the OTC market.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this doctoral thesis is {{to contribute to the}} field of Finance and Information Management with a particular focus on the financial ex-ante <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> IT projects. A sound and comprehensive ex-ante <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> IT projects is a central success factor in order to foster the value creation goal of a company in accordance with the principles of value-based management. In this context, financial valuation approaches facilitate well-founded IT investment decisions by enhancing the quantitative information basis for companies and decision makers. After discussing the significance and central role of modern IT for the economic success of companies, central challenges regarding the financial <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> IT projects in an ex-ante perspective are presented. More precisely, these challenges concern (i) the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> intangible benefits, (ii) the consideration of interdependencies between IT projects, and (iii) the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> IT projects in digitized value networks. Regarding the first challenge, the research papers focus on analyzing and discussing the potentials and the applicability of financial approaches for the ex-ante <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> intangible benefits. Regarding the second challenge, the research paper focuses on analyzing the influence of stochastic interdependencies on the risk <b>position</b> <b>of</b> IT projects and the associated investment decisions.

40|$|Banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> {{goodwill}} {{has been}} questioned by analysts and the media. Analysts suggest that bank management as of {{the inception of the}} financial crisis have exploited the unverifiable fair value goodwill accounting opportunistically. This suggestion implicitly implies that bank management was more likely than management of other industries to exploit goodwill accounting during the financial turmoil. In this thesis, I test whether the value relevance <b>of</b> banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill was affected differently than other industries during the financial turmoil. To do so, I use the value relevance of the pharmaceutical industry’s <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill as a control group for banks. Further, I hypothesize that (1) banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill was value irrelevant since investors should have impounded the information of the analysts in the stock price; (2) pharmaceutical industry’s <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill was value relevant since the financial turmoil did not severely affect its core business. The empirical result of the study suggests that the goodwill <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> both banks and pharmaceuticals was value relevant. Moreover, the empirical result indicates that banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill was not less value relevant than the pharmaceuticals’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill. In summary, banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill seems to have been value relevant during the financial turmoil. MSc in Accountin...|$|R
