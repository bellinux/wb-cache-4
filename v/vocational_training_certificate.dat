3000|$|Admission {{of these}} [...] "non-traditional" [...] {{students}} in fact usually {{is based on}} vocational qualifications as well. Often a <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> <b>certificate</b> plus work experience or specialists training is required and admission usually is restricted to related fields.|$|E
30|$|As {{outlined}} above, {{vocational training}} {{and higher education}} {{are not mutually exclusive}} in Germany and vocational training graduates can choose to enter higher education later in life (Büchel and Helberger 1995; Hammen 2011; Jacob 2004; Tieben and Rohrbach-Schmidt 2014). The reasons for this double qualification are manifold. On the one hand, we have to assume that individuals adjust their educational and occupational goals during their life course and decide to enter higher education after periods of labour market participation. Often, this happens in order to improve career prospects or because of dissatisfaction with the initially chosen occupation. Entering higher education can also be a strategy to escape from unemployment (Hammen 2011; Jacob 2004). On the other hand, double qualification may also be part of a deliberate education strategy. Especially in the 1990 s, it became increasingly popular to enter vocational training after having obtained a higher education entrance certificate. Büchel and Helberger (1995) assume an ‘insurance strategy’ of these double qualifiers in the German educational system as they hope to benefit from their vocational skills during higher education and in the labour market later on. Büchel and Helberger (1995) also mention the assumption that a <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> <b>certificate</b> may serve as fall-back option in case of higher education dropout. In a similar vein, Shavit and Müller (2000) discuss how vocational education is a ‘safety net’: A <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> <b>certificate</b> reduces the risk of unemployment and unskilled labour, especially in countries with a vocational training system which is specific rather than general, such as the German.|$|E
30|$|In Germany, almost 15 {{per cent}} of all first-year {{students}} leave higher education without obtaining a degree. The German post-secondary educational system is tracked however, and many dropouts enter the labour market with pre-tertiary <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> <b>certificates.</b> We therefore examine if higher education dropouts benefit from these vocational qualifications obtained outside {{higher education and}} use vocational credentials as a safety net.|$|R

30|$|Yet, {{especially}} for German <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> <b>certificates</b> {{it is the}} case that graduates are equipped with surplus skills and competences they do not use in their specific held occupations (Lutz and Grünert 2003). ‘A <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> occupation is defined as a bundle of qualifications that are learned, assessed and certified in an institutionalized training which enables the graduate to work in a number of similar occupations.’ (Tiemann 2015). Those trainings are regularly adapted to current developments and new requirements. Even if one of the occupational activities open for employees with a <b>training</b> <b>certificate</b> goes extinct, there are still other activities on the same qualification level the holder could change into. So, either workers would select to different jobs on the same level or the training would be adapted. So one might instead assume that many routine manual jobs might provide better protection against overqualification because jobs intensive in these tasks are often occupations that are trained in the German VET system with clearly defined skill requirements.|$|R

Given the skills needed for the high-demand occupations of the future, it is increasingly important that adult education programs expand the scope of opportunities offered so that adults learning English are prepared with the language, knowledge, and skills they need to be successful, whether their immedi-ate goals include gaining a <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> <b>certificate,</b> an associate’s degree, a bachelor’s degree, or a specifi...|$|E
30|$|Although {{there is}} a large body of {{research}} examining returns to education, these generally focus on formal qualifications, such as (general upper/vocational) secondary and tertiary certificates. A number of researchers acknowledge that attendance in higher education without graduation may deliver returns in the labour market, but empirical results are inconclusive (Bailey et al. 2004; Davies and Elias 2003; Flores-Lagunes and Light 2007; Grubb 2002; Johnes and Taylor 1991; Kane and Rouse 1995; Matković and Kogan 2012; Reisel 2013; Schnepf 2017; Stegmann and Kraft 1988). Schnepf (2017) for example shows that university dropouts are more likely to hold professional and managerial positions than upper secondary education graduates who never entered higher education in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the Netherlands, Poland, and Slovakia, but not in France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the UK. For Germany, Stegmann and Kraft (1988) find that higher education dropouts do not have a higher risk of being unemployed but achieve a lower occupational status and a lower income than higher education graduates. The same study also reveals that dropouts in Germany achieve a slightly higher income but no higher occupational status than upper secondary education graduates with a formal <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> <b>certificate.</b>|$|E
30|$|At {{this point}} {{we return to the}} above {{discussion}} of the ‘signaling’ value of higher education dropout and derive why ‘some college’ may not result in higher labour market returns in Germany, compared to individuals who have never entered higher education. The signalling value of vocational qualifications in the recruitment process depends on the link between the educational system and the labour market (Allmendinger 1989; Gangl 2003; Shavit and Müller 2000; van de Werfhorst 2011; Wolbers 2003). The German labour market can be regarded as being highly credentialist due to its strong linkage between vocational education and the labour market. 4 Because of the high specificity of the German vocational training system, the signals sent by job seekers’ formal vocational qualifications to prospective employers are particularly informative, whereas an unfinished higher education episode does not convey any information about the actual skills of an applicant. If we assume that higher education dropouts are aiming to enter skilled or even high skilled employment, they thus compete with applicants with formal qualifications for these jobs. From the perspective of an employer, an applicant with a <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> <b>certificate</b> hence should be the less ‘risky’ choice, e.g. in terms of training costs. We therefore expect that dropouts without vocational qualifications achieve lower returns in the labour market than individuals who graduated from vocational training but never entered higher education. More specifically, we expect them to be less likely to enter a stable employment. (Hypothesis 1 a) and to achieve on average a lower occupational status (Hypothesis 1 b).|$|E

However, due to the growing demand for abstract and codified knowledge, all three countries aim at increasing the permeability and individual mobility between the dual training sector and the higher education system. In this chapter we analyse the ways in which Germany, Austria and Switzerland have tried to establish institutional linkages between dual <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> and higher education. We begin by discussing options for creating such linkages: (1.) upgrading of <b>vocational</b> education and <b>training</b> courses, (2.) introducing dual courses of study, (3.) facilitating attendance of general upper secondary schools for people with vocational qualifications, (4.) enabling the parallel acquisition of a dual <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> qualification and a higher education entrance qualification, (5.) allowing admission to higher education on the basis of prior dual <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> qualifications and a certain amount of work experience, and (6.) recognising prior learning as an element in higher education programmes. Our analysis shows that, recently, Germany has relied strongly on the admission to higher education based on <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> <b>certificates</b> in combination with work experience. Switzerland and Austria are rather pushing the comprehensive introduction of programmes that enable the parallel acquisition of a dual <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> qualification and a higher education entrance qualification.

Methods Using data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS Starting Cohort 6), this study employs Cox and OLS regression models to examine the labour market transition of higher education dropouts. We distinguish the actual transitions (finding a job) from the occupational status of the first job. Results : Our results suggest that higher education dropouts without pre-tertiary vocational qualifications have more difficulties finding a job, compared to dropouts with pre-tertiary vocational qualifications. Comparing the occupational status of dropouts with and without pre-tertiary vocational qualifications, we find {{that these are not}} associated with a higher occupational status. Conclusions : We conclude that pre-tertiary vocational qualifications do serve as a safety net in case of drop out, because they protect from protracted pathways into the labour market. Apart from this we do not find evidence for additional returns of vocational certificates in terms of occupational status...|$|R

40|$|Master of EducationThis study {{focuses on}} the {{implementation}} experience of a Victorian secondary college {{during the first year}} of participation in the Australia <b>Vocational</b> <b>Certificate</b> <b>Training</b> in Secondary Schools Pilot Project - an initiative arising from recent reports, at both a State and Federal level, recommending a convergence between general and vocational education. The Pilot Project was established to test the feasibility of the provision of <b>vocational</b> education and <b>training</b> in secondary colleges. The literature review presents a synopsis of the Australian <b>Vocational</b> <b>Certificate</b> <b>Training</b> System, national <b>vocational</b> education and <b>training</b> initiatives and the literature relating to the evaluation of educational change. Using qualitative methods, the study provides a systematic description of the first year of implementation, evaluates the processes used for the implementation of educational change and examines the policies which impact on the implementation process. The analysis highlights the importance of the internal perceptions of the need for the change and the 'state of readiness' as key considerations in the implementation of change in schools. The relationship between the processes adopted for initiation, including bureaucratic influences, and implementation within the school context is also discussed. The study concludes with cautionary notes. Firstly, the difficulties experienced by schools in implementing policy initiatives within a federal political structure. Secondly, the uncertainty which results when the motivations for change are linked to key bureaucratic personalities. Thirdly, key policies which inhibit the fusion of general and vocational education by forcing schools to differentiate between these roles are discussed. The author also questions the proposition that the fidelity and evolutionary perspectives of the implementation of educational change are extremes of the same continuum. The study provides specific advice for the administration of vocational courses within schools and stresses that further development is limited by the lagging development of policies to provide full recognition of training programs within the senior secondary curriculum.

A key goal for community colleges is to be a resource for all segments of the community (Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, 2000). Walker (2001) reinforced this directive by stating that the community college purpose was “to bring higher education in its various forms into the community” (p. 9). Community colleges have concentrated much of their attention on several subpopulations within the community, such as students in <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> or <b>certificate</b> programs and academically under-prepared students (Outcalt, 1999). As the numbers of students increase, community colleges are becoming aware of other subpopulations and their needs. A sub-population found at community colleges that is gaining more attention is academically well-prepared students (Skau, 1989). One way that community colleges have addressed the special requirements of this subpopulation is by offering honors classes or an honors program to challenge these students and prepare them for transition to four-year institutions (Outcalt, 1999). Outcalt (1999) maintains that a major function of community colleges is to prepare their students for transfer to four-year institutions. Even as community colleges prepare their students for transfer to four-year institutions, however, 79 % of the students experience a phenomenon termed “transfer shock” (Diaz, 1992). This phenomenon was first described by Hills (1965) and was defined as an appreciable drop in grade point average (GPA) upon transfer to a four-year university...|$|R

30|$|The 2008 – 09 {{recession}} has hit youth hard {{in terms of}} their employment prospects across the OECD (OECD [2010]). With regard to its low youth unemployment rates, Switzerland is often recognized as a country that performs well in international comparison (OECD [2010], [2013 b]; Hoeckel et al. [2009]). Institutional settings such as comparatively weak employment protection legislations (EPL) (see OECD [2013 a]) that allow school leavers to more easily set foot within the labour market (see Breen [2005]) as well as the strong vocational orientation of the upper secondary education system both have a share in this. <b>Vocational</b> education and <b>training</b> (VET) is the dominant form of upper secondary education in Switzerland and equips the majority of youth with vocation specific certificates that foster smooth transitions to the labour market. About two thirds of youth pursue a vocational education at upper secondary level in Switzerland while only about one fourth takes up a general education (SERI [2014]; Stalder and Nägele [2011]). In international comparison, Switzerland stands out in terms of the share of school leavers who pursue a dual-vocational education (Hoeckel et al. [2009]: 10 – 11), which is an apprenticeship that combines school and workplace-based training. Most apprenticeships take three to four years to complete and are awarded with a federal certificate of <b>vocational</b> education and <b>training</b> that qualifies one for taking up work in the occupation trained in. About a quarter of the students who pursue vocational education at upper secondary level further obtain a federal vocational baccalaureate, which is an optional qualification that allows them to enrol in tertiary vocational education such as at the universities of applied sciences (Fuentes [2011]; Hoeckel et al. [2009]; Stalder and Nägele [2011]). Overall, the Swiss VET system can be described as highly standardised as it equips the young with <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> and <b>certificates</b> that meet similar standards nationwide (see Müller and Shavit [1998]: 6 – 7). These vocational certificates send clear signals to employers about the occupation-specific skills and suitability of the young entrants for particular jobs (Breen [2005]), further fostering smooth transitions.|$|R
