5|$|The {{distinctive}} nasal arch of Gryposaurus, {{like other}} cranial modifications in duckbills, {{may have been}} used for a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> functions, such as identification of sexes or species and social ranking. It could also have functioned as a tool for broadside pushing or butting in social contests, and there may have been inflatable air sacs flanking it for both visual and auditory signaling. The top of the arch is roughened in some specimens, suggesting that it was covered by thick, keratinized skin, or that there was a cartilaginous extension.|$|E
5|$|A <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>social,</b> cultural, ethnic, and {{linguistic}} factors {{contributed to the}} sparking of unrest in eastern and southern Ukraine {{in the aftermath of}} the early 2014 revolution in Ukraine. Following Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, resurfacing historical and cultural divisions and a weak state structure hampered the development of a unified Ukrainian national identity. In eastern and southern Ukraine, Russification and ethnic Russian settlement during centuries of Russian rule caused the Russian language to attain primacy, even amongst ethnic Ukrainians. In Crimea, ethnic Russians have comprised the majority of the population since the deportation of the indigenous Crimean Tatars by Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin following the Second World War. This contrasts with western and central Ukraine, which were historically ruled by a variety of powers, such as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Austrian Empire. In these areas, the Ukrainian ethnic, national, {{and linguistic}} identity remained intact.|$|E

5|$|Arkham Citys {{marketing}} campaign {{was designed to}} reach an audience outside of superhero fans and appeal to consumers who are attracted to games like the first-person shooter series Call of Duty. Warner Bros.'s marketing team decided that Batman's status as a cultural icon and superhero was unavoidable, {{so they decided to}} emphasize other elements of the character that could appeal to fans of first-person shooters and action games. Black-and-white photographs of iconic personalities like inventor Steve Jobs and actor James Dean served as inspiration and a basis for the final {{marketing campaign}} used in advertisements and the game's cover art. The imagery, highlighted with blood and bathed in light was considered {{to move away from the}} classic superhero image and refocus on Batman's humanity. The black and white campaign was featured on 120 magazine covers and was targeted towards approximately 15 million consumers across a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> media and Warner Bros. products, in addition to a series of viral marketing videos and stunts involving actors in costume attending press-related events.

The entire campaign spent more than a year in development, producing artwork, videos, DLC, printed advertisements, billboards, and events, and was estimated to have cost at least $10 million.|$|E
