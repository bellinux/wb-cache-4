25|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{attitude of}} the vehicle was compared with the desired <b>vehicle</b> <b>attitude</b> in the LVDC. Attitude correction signals from the LVDC were converted into control commands by the flight control computer. The required thrust direction was obtained by gimbaling the engines in the propelling stage to change the thrust direction of the vehicle. Gimbaling of these engines was accomplished through hydraulic actuators. In {{the first and second}} stages (S-IC and S-II), the four outboard engines were gimbaled to control roll, pitch, and yaw. Since the third (S-IVB) stage has only one engine, an auxiliary propulsion system was used for roll control during powered flight. The auxiliary propulsion system provides complete attitude control during coast flight of the S-IUB/IU stage.|$|E

50|$|The forces {{acting on}} {{spacecraft}} are of three types: propulsive force (usually {{provided by the}} vehicle's engine thrust); gravitational force exerted by the Earth and other celestial bodies; and aerodynamic lift and drag (when flying in {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth or another body, such as Mars or Venus). The <b>vehicle's</b> <b>attitude</b> {{must be taken into account}} because of its effect on the aerodynamic and propulsive forces.

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} a study on how a rategyro triad, an {{accelerometer}} triad, and a magnetometer triad can be integrated into a navigation system, estimating a <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>attitude,</b> i. e. its roll, tipp, and heading angles. When only a rategyro triad is used to estimate a <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>attitude,</b> a drift in the attitude occurs due to sensor errors. When an accelerometer triad and a magnetometer triad are used, an error in the vehicle’s heading, appearing as a sine curve, depending on the heading, occurs. By integrating these sensor triads, the sensor errors have been estimated with a filter to improve the estimated attitude’s accuracy. To investigate and evaluate the navigation system, a simulation model has been developed in Simulink/Matlab. The implementation has been made using a Kalman filter where the sensor fusion takes place. Simulations for different scenarios have been made and the results from these simulations show that the drift in the <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>attitude</b> is avoided...|$|R

50|$|Active Stability Control stabilizes <b>vehicle</b> <b>attitude</b> while {{maintaining}} optimum traction by regulating engine {{power and the}} braking force at each wheel. Taking a step beyond the previous generation Lancer Evolution, the fitting of a brake pressure sensor at each wheel allows more precise and positive control of braking force. ASC improves traction under acceleration by preventing the driving wheels from spinning on slippery surfaces. It also elevates vehicle stability by suppressing skidding in an emergency evasive maneuver or the result of other sudden steering inputs.|$|E
50|$|A strapdown {{system has}} a dynamic {{measurement}} range several hundred times that required by a gimballed system.

50|$|Vernier {{thrusters}} {{are used}} in rockets such as the R-7 for vehicle maneuvering because the main engine is fixed in place. For the Atlas rocket family, in addition to maneuvering, the verniers were used for roll control, although the booster engines could also perform this function.

Beginning with Vehicles 204 and 501, two C-band radar transponders will be carried in the instrumentation unit (IU) to provide radar tracking capabilities independent of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>attitude.</b> This arrangement is more reliable than the antenna switching circuits necessary if only one transponder would be used.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, William D. Allison {{developed}} Torsion-Level Suspension used on 1955-1956 model Packards. This was an interconnected suspension, with torsion bars {{that ran}} along {{each side of}} the frame, connecting the front wheel to the rear (on the same side). Because this system is so affected by load, a supplemental, electronic leveling system was added, which uses a level sensor and a single motor to load/unload a pair of auxiliary bars to adjust <b>vehicle</b> <b>attitude,</b> but not overall ride height. This early attempt was an important step on the road to self-leveling, even if a full load would cause the whole car to lower evenly, rather than maintain height.|$|E
