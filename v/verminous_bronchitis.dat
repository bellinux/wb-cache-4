5000|$|Parasitic bronchitis, {{also known}} as hoose, husk, or <b>verminous</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> is a disease of sheep, cattle, goats, and swine caused by the {{presence}} of various species of parasite, commonly known as lungworms, in the bronchial tubes or in the lungs. It is marked by cough, dyspnea, anorexia and constipation. Lungworms which cause parasitic bronchitis include nematodes of the genera Dictyocaulus, Metastrongylus, and Protostrongylus. Hoose is essentially an infantile disease, almost always afflicting animals under one year of age.|$|E
40|$|Clinical and {{physiologic}} investigations {{were done}} weekly in 5 nonsedated Friesian calves before, during, and after an induced infection with Dictyocaulus viviparus infective larvae. Clinical, hematologic, serologic, and parasitologic findings were all {{compatible with the}} classic picture of moderate subacute <b>verminous</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> Most pulmonary function values revealed significant (P {{less than or equal}} to 0. 05) changes in the 2 nd or 3 rd week after inoculation and maximal changes at 5 weeks after inoculation. Most marked changes included a decrease in tidal volume, dynamic lung compliance, and arterial oxygen tension, and an increase in minute ventilation, minute viscous work of breathing, and alveolar-arterial oxygen difference. Minute ventilation, dynamic lung compliance, minute viscous work of breathing, and PaO 2 revealed the most homogeneous change. Conversely, maximal change of intrapleural pressure, total pulmonary resistance, and viscous work of breathing had higher variability from week to weekPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Lungworms {{can result}} an {{infection}} of the lower respiratory tract, usually resulting in <b>verminous</b> <b>bronchitis</b> or verminous pneumonia. The {{aim of this study}} was assessment of cattle and buffaloes contamination to lungworms of Tabriz city in Iran in 2013. In this study initially with referring to Tabrizabattoir were selected rejected and apparently healthy lungs by randomly and then sent to parasitology laboratory of veterinary faculty of Tabriz branch, Islamic Azad university. In lab, lungs were opened and contents were isolated. Then with staining of parasites and creating of slides, type of parasite was detected by light microscope. Of 200 collected lungs, were infected 33 cases (16. 5 %) to hydatid cyst, 95 cases (47. 5 %) to Dictyocaulus viviparous. also 13 cases (6. 5 %) of lungs were infected to Linguatula serrata larva. with attention to relatively high contamination rate in Iran, exerting of prevention and treatment measures was recommended...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the bovine breathing pattern, tidal breathing flow-volume loops (TBFVL) were analyzed in 24 healthy cattle of different body weights (range: 37 - 660 kg) (Group A) and in 28 cattle suffering from the common respiratory diseases: <b>verminous</b> <b>bronchitis</b> (Group B); shipping fever (Group C); acute respiratory distress syndrome (Group D); respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia (Group E); organophosphate poisoning (Group F); and necrotic laryngitis (Group G). Respiratory airflow and tidal volume were measured with a breathing mask-Fleisch pneumotachograph assembly. TBFVL were traced from these values using a computerized method. All the loop indices proposed by Amis and Kurpershoek (1986 a) were calculated from 5 representative breathing cycles for each of the 52 animals. The TBFVL shapes and indices were relatively constant in most healthy cattle and were not correlated with the body size. When compared to normal values, animals with moderate respiratory syndromes (Groups B and C) had a more flattened shape to their TBFVL. On the other hand, in most cattle with severe respiratory pathologies (Groups D, F and G expiration tended to be biphasic with the peak expiratory flow (PEF) occurring significantly later than in healthy animals. Both PEF and peak inspiratory flow were increased in all the pathological conditions. The TBFVL indices were more frequently and more severely changed during expiration than during inspiration.

40|$|Dictyocaulus viviparus is the {{aetiological}} {{agent of}} <b>verminous</b> <b>bronchitis</b> in cattle. Herein we describe an atypical case of parasitic pneumonitis {{in an adult}} cow. Methods At the end of March 2017, a 3 -yr old Belgian Blue cow suddenly displayed a marked respiratory distress syndrome {{a few hours after}} C-section calving. In spite of the treatment set up by the local veterinarian, the cow died 48 hours later. The body was referred to the Veterinary Faculty of Liège (Belgium) for necropsy. Post- mortem gross examination revealed a severe, acute interstitial pneumonitis with concurrent emphysema and a significant amount of parasites (Dictyocaulus viviparus) in the bronchi. The microscopic examination confirmed the severe acute interstitial pneumonitis with foci of hemorrhages, necrosis, hyaline membranes and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes. Larvae were also present in the alveoli and bronchioles. Results Altogether, theses clinical observations and lesions were compatible with a hypersensitivity reaction against worm antigens. Additionally, Baermann’s test was performed on feces collected from the cadaver and from 5 others cows kept under the same conditions. Four out of 6 cows were excreting small amounts of Dictyocaulus stage- 1 larvae. Conclusions Parasitic pneumonia is a very common disease in first year grazing young cattle. In this case, cow’s age and disease manifestation time were very uncommon. Three-year-old cows are supposed to be fully protected against this nematode species. Moreover, in Belgium, at the end of March, livestock is still kept indoors (zero grazing winter period). Therefore, this case could highlight the hypobiotic capacity of Dictyocaulus viviparus larvae and associated « periparturient rise » phenomenon, both well known in sheep, but not described in cattle so far. We herein discuss the farming conditions that promoted such a severe parasitic respiratory disease...|$|E
