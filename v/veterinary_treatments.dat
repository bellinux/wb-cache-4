40|$|Abstract Background Research has {{indicated}} {{that a number of}} different factors affect whether an animal receives treatment or not when diseased. The aim of this paper was to evaluate if herd or individual animal characteristics influence whether cattle receives <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatment</b> for disease, and thereby also introduce misclassification in the disease recording system. Methods The data consisted mainly of disease events reported by farmers during 2004. We modelled odds of receiving <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatment</b> when diseased, using two-level logistic regression models for cows and young animals (calves and heifers), respectively. Model parameters were estimated using three procedures, because these procedures have been shown, under some conditions, to produce biased estimates for multi-level models with binary outcomes. Results Cows located in herds mainly consisting of Swedish Holstein cows had higher odds for <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatment</b> than cows in herds mainly consisting of Swedish Red cows. Cows with a disease event early in lactation had higher odds for treatment than when the event occurred later in lactation. There were also higher odds for <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatment</b> of events for cows in January and April than in July and October. The odds for <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatment</b> of events in young animals were higher if the farmer appeared to be good at keeping records. Having a disease event at the same date as another animal increased the odds for <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatment</b> for all events in young animals, and for lameness, metabolic, udder and other disorders, but not for peripartum disorders, in cows. There were also differences in the odds for <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatment</b> between disease complexes, both for cows and young animals. The random effect of herd was significant in both models and accounted for 40 – 44 % of the variation in the cow model and 30 – 46 % in the young animal model. Conclusion We conclude that cow and herd characteristics influence the odds for <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatment</b> and that this might bias the results from studies using data from the cattle disease database based on veterinary practice records. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the changes in production, herd health and <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatments</b> in Danish organic dairy herds during {{approximately}} eleven years based on historic data from herds converted to organic milk production before 1990 (old organic herds) compared to herds converted in 1995 and 1999 - 2000 and herds that are still conventional. Herd size, milk production, {{the shape of the}} lactation curve, somatic cell counts and <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatments</b> for mastitis, retained placenta and ketosis are compared over time and between herd groups. The old organic herds differed from the other three herd groups by having lower milk production per cow, lower somatic cell counts and fewer treatments of mastitis. Herds converted in 1995 and 1999 - 2000 were comparable to the conventional herds before conversion for all analyzed parameters. However, herd size was larger than both the older organic herds and the conventional herds after conversion. Production was about 2 kg energy corrected milk lower per cow per day than before conversion and compared to the conventional herds. In the herds converted in 1999 - 2000 little difference could be seen in relation to udder health after conversion when compared to conventional herds. The organic herds had fewer treatments for retained placenta and ketosis than the conventional herds. The shape of the lactation curves changed over the 11 year period with better persistency from day 60 to day 305 in all herd groups except for the old organic herds, which had the best persistency in 1990. ...|$|E

40|$|Mastitis is a {{dairy cattle}} disease leading to great {{economic}} losses in milk production, management costs and <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatments.</b> This character generally shows an unfavourable genetic correlation with milk production. However, genetic factors influencing mastitis susceptibility independent from those influencing milk production could exist. Therefore, {{it should be}} possible to select at the same time against mastitis and for high milk production. The “somatic cell count” (SCC) can be used for selection against mastitis due to high genetic correlation with mastitis (Weller et al., 1992), higher heritability than clinical mastitis, lower costs for data collection and data availability at national level with an objective measurement. Genetic evaluation for “somatic cell count” has been recently officially introduced also in Italy for Holstein Friesian [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The {{organic farming}} {{regulations}} put {{emphasis on the}} preservation of animal health by prophylaxis in the agriculture. The No 5 of the regulation EC 1804 / 99 (EC organic regulation) Appendix I B defines the <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatments</b> in organic animal husbandry. The veterinarian can use any medicine, which is effective for the indication and the animal species. If possible, effective homeopathics, phytotherapeutics or the like should have priority. Problems of implementing the EC organic regulation into the daily farm practice arise mostly from the doubling of the withdrawal period and the restriction of the numbers of treatments. The strict ban on prophylactic treatments is not mentioned any longer in the new regulation 834 / 2007, which shall apply as from 1 st January 2009. Clarification of the guidelines for animal treatments in organic farming seems to be useful for farmers, veterinarians and boards of control. ...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{relationship}} between the herd status for claw health and herd parameters. Herd parameters were derived from an assessment of the housing conditions and were based on a welfare index and critical checkpoints. Data has been collected on four conventional large dairy farms in northeast Germany. All farms have free-stall systems with cubicles offering a lying area. During the period from 2005 to 2008 on each farm claw disorders were recorded at time of regular hoof trimming, i. e. two or three times a year. Data was augmented by data on <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatments</b> of feet and legs. The Data comprises 18 119 observations of 3 690 cows. Housing conditions were assessed in the year 2008. The results show that a consequent and determined management of herd health is necessary to substantially improve the status of claw health. Housing and management confirming the rules of animal welfare will contribute to the well-being of dairy cows...|$|E
