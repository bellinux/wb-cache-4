5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1957–58 season, Craig was made captain for Australia's Test tour to South Africa, making him the {{youngest}} captain in Test history at the age of 22years and 194days, with Harvey as his deputy. The appointment came despite his mixed batting form during the New Zealand tour. The selectors further demonstrated their <b>view</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> future when they dropped veteran Ray Lindwall altogether. The average age of Craig's team was {{two and a half years}} younger than the Australian squad sent to England in 1956, and they had only one player over the age of 30, whereas the 1956 team had five members over the age of 30. As a result of the team's relative inexperience, they were judged by critics to be the worst to have left Australian shores. Craig joined his team in Johannesburg after flying in from London, where he had been working for six months as a pharmacist, with the approval of the Australian board.|$|E
5|$|Governmental Regulation No. 493/2002 Coll. {{divides the}} listed {{illnesses}} and handicaps into four groups, covering various issues from psychological and psychiatrical to eyesight and hearing (for example, the applicant {{must be able}} to hear casual speech over distance of 6 meters to be cleared for the E category). Generally, the regulation is more permissive {{when it comes to the}} license categories A and B, and more strict with <b>view</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other categories, listing which illnesses and handicaps may curtail or outright prevent positive clearance by the general practitioner. The outcome of the medical examination may be either full clearance, denial, or conditional clearance that lists obligatory health accessories (glasses, hearing aid, etc.) or sets obligatory escort when armed (e.g. B – sport shooters with minor psychological issues, or with addiction habits cured more than three years prior to the health check).|$|E

5|$|However, {{contrary}} to {{the expectations of the}} Red Queen hypothesis, Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat. Furthermore, Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in their host. At an even more fundamental level, Heng and Gorelick and Heng reviewed evidence that sex, rather than enhancing diversity, acts as a constraint on genetic diversity. They considered that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve. The adaptive function of sex, today, remains a major unresolved issue in biology. The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex were reviewed by Birdsell and Wills. A principal alternative <b>view</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Red Queen hypothesis is that sex arose, and is maintained, as a process for repairing DNA damage, and that genetic variation is produced as a byproduct.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} coup, {{officers}} loyal to Umran and the Aflaqites were purged from the armed forces, being imprisoned alongside Umran at Mezze prison. One {{of the first}} acts of Jadid's government was to appoint Assad Minister of Defence. Assad however, {{did not support the}} coup, and told Mansur al-Atrash, Jubran Majdalani, and other Aflaqites that he did not support Jadid's actions. Later, in an interview with Le Monde, Assad claimed that the military's intervention was regrettable because the Ba'ath Party was democratic, and that the disputes should have been resolved in a democratic manner. However, Assad did view the actions as necessary, as it put an end, in his <b>view,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dictatorship of the National Command.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ninth}} century, Hrabanus Maurus and Ratramnus also defended Augustine's view of non{{metabolic}} real presence. During {{the high and}} late Middle Ages, the metabolic view became increasingly dominant {{to the exclusion of}} the nonmetabolic <b>view,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point that it was considered the only orthodox option. The doctrine of transubstantiation was developed in the high Middle Ages to explain the change of the elements into Christ's body and blood. Transubstantiation is the belief that the Eucharistic elements are transformed into Christ's body and blood in a way only perceivable by the intellect, not by the senses.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the eastern}} {{tip of the}} Ashokan Reservoir, {{in the town of}} Kingston, NY28 intersects the eastern {{terminus}} of NY28A. West of NY28A, NY28 continues towards the north and west along the northern edge of the reservoir. In West Hurley, the route intersects the southern terminus of NY375. It proceeds along the reservoir to its western end in the town of Olive community of Boiceville, where NY28A reconnects to the route. Here the mountains begin to loom over the road, with Mount Tremper dominating the <b>view</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north as the route continues along Esopus Creek into the town of Shandaken after passing the southern terminus of NY212 at Mount Pleasant. At Phoenicia, the largest settlement since Kingston, NY214 reaches its southern terminus at the highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} of the Boonton Branch was steadily decommissioned through 1963, as the New Jersey Department of Transportation requested the Boonton Branch's alignment through Paterson as part of Interstate 80 and New Jersey Route 21 through Passaic near BE Drawbridge and the Passaic Park station. This {{was turned over to}} the Department of Transportation on October 27, 1963, after a connection was constructed at Mountain <b>View</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Erie's former New York and Greenwood Lake Railroad. The stretch from Paterson Junction to Totowa, including the Paterson High Bridge built in 1902, was abandoned and soon dismantled. However, despite the changes, the ErieLackawanna continued to lose strength and in 1975, agreed {{to become part of the}} Consolidated Rail Corporation, dubbed Conrail, effective April 1, 1976.|$|E
