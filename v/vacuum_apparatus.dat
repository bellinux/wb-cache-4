50|$|A fine mist of oil {{droplets}} was sprayed into {{a chamber}} above the plates. The oil {{was of a}} type usually used in <b>vacuum</b> <b>apparatus</b> and was chosen because it had an extremely low vapour pressure. Ordinary oil would evaporate under {{the heat of the}} light source causing the mass of the oil drop to change {{over the course of the}} experiment. Some oil drops became electrically charged through friction with the nozzle as they were sprayed. Alternatively, charging could be brought about by including an ionising radiation source (such as an X-ray tube). The droplets entered the space between the plates and, because they were charged, could be made to rise and fall by changing the voltage across the plates.|$|E
50|$|However, Khan {{maintained}} that Khan first met with Tinner in 1976 when Khan and Tinner were placing sensitive {{projects for the}} Vakuum-Apparate-Technik (VAT) (English: <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Apparatus</b> Technology). A competent nuclear engineer, Tinner left VAT and traveled to Pakistan quite often as he was employed at Khan's Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL). Tinner resided with Khan and his family where, at ERL, Tinner performed experiments under Khan's supervision. However, in the 1980s, Tinner was invited by Colonel Muammar Gaddafi to join and head the Libyan nuclear program. Throughout the 1980s, Tinner tried to maintain the Libyan nuclear program and performed illicit and illegal experiments. However, Tinner again left for Pakistan and the program was dismantled. In 1995, Tinner again returned to Libya with the documentation provided by Khan. Following his return, Tinner became technical directorate officer of Libyan nuclear program, using Khan's expertise to developed the centrifuges. However, due to Libya's academic progress and lack of technicians, the program could not prevail and suffered many setbacks. In 2000, Khan provided sensitive centrifuge designs to Tinner on gas-centrifuge method. But due to its complexity and difficulty, Tinner was unable to establish the gas-cetrifuge program for Libyan nuclear program, therefore, Colonel Gaddafi dismantled and rolled back the program. In 2004, Libya dismantled its program and provided its technical and nuclear materials to IAEA and the United States. Libyan revelations also led the arrest of its {{former head of the}} program, Friederich Tinner. In Pakistan, Abdul Qadeer Khan was debriefed by the Pakistan Armed Forces which continued until next 4 years.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} in-situ method {{to measure the}} {{birefringence}} of a single vacuum window by means of microwave spectroscopy on an ensemble of cold atoms. Stress-induced birefringence can cause an ellipticity in the polarization of an initially linearly-polarized laser beam. The amount of ellipticity can be reconstructed by measuring the differential vector light shift of an atomic hyperfine transition. Measuring the ellipticity {{as a function of}} the linear polarization angle allows us to infer the amount of birefringence Î n at the level of 10 ^- 8 and identify the orientation of the optical axes. The key benefit of this method is the ability to separately characterize each vacuum window, allowing the birefringence to be precisely compensated in existing <b>vacuum</b> <b>apparatuses.</b> Comment: 3 pages, 2 figures; in the new version, corrected the range of typical values of induced birefringenc...|$|R

As a consequence of the underlying physical principles, in the presence of air, such an XRF scanner is limited to analysis of chlorine and elements of greater atomic number. When the XRF scanner is operated in a vacuum, it extends the range of analysis to lower atomic numbers - even as far as aluminum and sodium. Hence, more elements will be available for use in XRF labeling of objects as discussed in the two preceding articles. The added benefits of the extended capabilities also have other uses for NASA. Detection of elements of low atomic number is of high interest to the aerospace community. High-strength aluminum alloys will be easily analyzed for composition. Silicon, a major contaminant in certain processes, will be detectable before the process is begun, possibly eliminating weld or adhesion problems. Exotic alloys will be evaluated for composition prior to being placed in service where lives depend on them.
