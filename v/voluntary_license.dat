40|$|Abstract: BACKGROUND: Threats by {{enforced}} Intellectual Property (IP) {{rights to}} equitable HIV treatment access by poor populations are impending. India and China’s policy directions {{in the field}} will be crucial in ultimately affecting the affordability and accessibility of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in the under-served markets. These directions, together with the exploitation level of IP-bound flexibilities and the evolutionary modelling in partnerships and trade agreements between research-based and generic pharmaceutical industry, will also affect the outcomes of self-sufficiency efforts now at their beginning {{in the developing world}} as far as domestic manufacturing of generic ARV drugs is concerned. AIMS: This paper explores key issues, implications and interaction dynamics across these challenging scenarios while attempting to provide equitable solution glimpses into the near future. RESULTS: Access-oriented long-term drug policy strategies entitled to pass muster of governments, research-based as well as generic industries in both developed and developing countries are needed if equitable access to affordable ARV treatments by poor people has to be achieved despite enforced IP rights. Predictable dynamics between western multinationals and transitional country generic corporations let regard IP-bound <b>Voluntary</b> <b>License</b> flexibilities as a fitting measure into just mentioned needs especially i...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To analyze Government {{strategies}} for reducing prices of antiretroviral medicines for HIV in Brazil. METHODS Analysis of Ministry of Health purchases of antiretroviral medicines, from 2005 to 2013. Expenditures {{and costs of}} the treatment per year were analyzed and compared to international prices of atazanavir. Price reductions were estimated based on {{the terms of a}} <b>voluntary</b> <b>license</b> of patent rights and technology transfer in the Partnership for Productive Development Agreement for atazanavir. RESULTS Atazanavir, a patented medicine, represented a significant share of the expenditures on antiretrovirals purchased from the private sector. Prices in Brazil were higher than international references, and no evidence was found of a relationship between purchase volume and price paid by the Ministry of Health. Concerning the latest strategy to reduce prices, involving local production of the 200 mg capsule, the price reduction was greater than the estimated reduction. As for the 300 mg capsule, the amounts paid {{in the first two years}} after the Partnership for Productive Development Agreement were close to the estimated values. Prices in nominal values for both dosage forms remained virtually constant between 2011 (the signature of the Partnership for Productive Development Agreement), 2012 and 2013 (after the establishment of the Partnership). CONCLUSIONS Price reduction of medicines is complex in limited-competition environments. The use of a Partnership for Productive Development Agreement as a strategy to increase the capacity of local production and to reduce prices raises issues regarding its effectiveness in reducing prices and to overcome patent barriers. Investments in research and development that can stimulate technological accumulation should be considered by the Government to strengthen its bargaining power to negotiate medicines prices under a monopoly situation...|$|E

40|$|Every fight, every {{encounter}} {{in which the}} pharmaceutical industry has tried to push back against compulsory licensing has the industry losing ground. Fighting this issue, whether in the World Trade Organization or through local courts, is not working.

Perhaps the most successful strategy to date though is the “negotiated voluntary licensing” model, most famously employed by Gilead Pharmaceuticals in India. Negotiated <b>voluntary</b> <b>licensing</b> allows the licensor to control the terms of the licensing agreement, the scope of the market for which the licensees’ products can reach, and provides additional sources of revenue without much threat to more marketable countries. Perhaps most importantly, the model promotes cooperation between native generic manufactures and international parties wishing to protect their intellectual property rights, while promoting goodwill through better access to medicine, a hot-button issue recently of great concern to governments, citizens, and media.

As mentioned in the text, the results {{are very similar to}} our baseline results. Appendix B: Compulsory Versus Bargained License Fees The analysis in the text characterized the steady-state equilibrium for a given sequence of license fees, implicitly assumed to be determined by IPR policy—i. e., these fees correspond to compulsory licensing fees for intellectual property that has been patented. This corresponds to a world in which once a company patents an innovation, the knowledge embedded in this innovation can be used by its competitors as long as they pay a prespecied license fee. One may also wish to consider an alternative world in which license fees are determined by bilateral bargaining. To characterize the equilibrium in such a world, one must rst conduct exactly the same analysis as we have done in this subsection. In other words, one must characterize the equilibrium for a given sequence of license fees, and then taking the license fees agreed by other rms as given, one can consider the bargaining problem between a leader and a follower. In general, there may or may not exist feasible <b>voluntary</b> <b>license</b> fees that the follower and the leader can bargain to (such voluntary agreements may be infeasible even if compulsory licensing is benecial, since consumers also benet from licensing).

40|$|Many {{advocates for}} using {{compulsory}} licensing (“CL”) for pharmaceutical patents {{in developing countries}} like Thailand rest their case {{in part on the}} purported use of CL in the United States. In this paper we take issue with that proposition on several grounds. As a theoretical matter, we argue that the basic presumption in favor of <b>voluntary</b> <b>licenses</b> for IP should apply in the international arena, in addition to the domestic one. In the international context, <b>voluntary</b> <b>licenses</b> are of special importance because they strengthen the supply chain for distributing pharmaceuticals and ease the government enforcement of safety standards. Next, this paper analyzes several of the key illustrations of purported CL for drug patents in the United States and shows that the use of CL elsewhere deviates in material ways from the standard U. S. practices. These are the compulsory copyright licenses for music; the award of damages instead of injunctions after eBay v. MercExchange, and the use of compulsory licenses in antitrust settlements. Whatever the ultimate desirability of these American doctrines, none of them seeks to reduce the payment on licenses to the marginal cost of the licensed goods. Any need to help poor people gain access should not rely on CL, but instead should rely on tools precisely aimed at that purpose, including direct government purchases of patented drugs from their manufacturers at negotiated prices...|$|R

40|$|Background. Significant {{quantities}} of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) to treat HIV/AIDS have been procured for Sub-Saharan Africa {{for the first}} time in their 20 -year history. This presents a novel opportunity to empirically study the roles of brand and generic suppliers in providing access to ARVs. Methodology/Principal Findings. An observational study of brand and generic supply based on a dataset of 2, 162 orders of AIDS drugs for Sub-Saharan Africa reported to the Global Price Reporting Mechanism at the World Health Organization from January 2004 -March 2006 was performed. Generic companies supplied 63 % of the drugs studied, at prices that were on average about a third of the prices charged by brand companies. 96 % of the procurement was of first line drugs, which were provided mostly by generic firms, while the remaining 4 %, of second line drugs, was sourced primarily from brand companies. 85 % of the generic drugs in the sample were manufactured in India, where the majority of the drugs procured were ineligible for patent protection. The remaining 15 % was manufactured in South Africa, mostly under <b>voluntary</b> <b>licenses</b> provided by brand companies to a single generic company. In Sub-Saharan African countries, four first line drugs in the dataset were widely patented, however no general deterrent to generic purchasing based on a patent was detected. Conclusions/Significance. Generic and brand companies have played distinct roles in increasing the availability of ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa. Generic companies provided most of the drugs studied, at prices below those charged by brand companies, and until now, almost exclusively supplied several fixed-dose combination drugs. Brand companies have supplied almost all second line drugs, signed <b>voluntary</b> <b>licenses</b> with generic companies, and are not strictly enforcing patents in certain countries. Further investigation into how price reductions in second line drugs can be achieved and the cheapest drugs can actually be procured is warranted...|$|R

After the European Union adopted the Database Directive to provide legal protection for non-copyrightable database contents, the U.

One of the major difficulties of formulating a socially beneficial database law is in finding the right balance between protecting the incentives of creating publicly accessible databases (including semi-structured web sites) and preserving adequate access to factual data for value creating activities. We address the problem by developing an extended spatial competition model that explicitly considers the inefficiencies in policy administration. With the model, we can determine various conditions and the corresponding socially beneficial policy choices. The results show that, depending on the cost level of database creation, the degree of differentiation of the reuser database, and the efficiency of policy administration, the socially beneficial policy choice can be protecting a legal monopoly, encouraging competition via compulsory <b>licensing,</b> discouraging <b>voluntary</b> <b>licensing,</b> or even allowing free riding.

40|$|In the {{backdrop}} of the strict patent regime flatly adopted by the World Trade Organization (WTO) for all countries, a few countries constantly challenge this system through aggressive patent bargains. Within the pharmaceutical sector, noticeably, some countries now threaten to issue or otherwise actually issue compulsory licenses that may sway large pharmaceutical companies into selling drugs with large discounts or into granting <b>voluntary</b> <b>licenses</b> domestically. That is conspicuously the negotiation strategy adopted by Brazil in its negotiations with big international pharmaceutical companies. This paper explains Brazil’s aggressive bargaining approach based on an analysis of two aspects of its political economy. The first {{has to do with the}} international context of patent bargaining in the post-WTO era. Accordingly, the existence of large and fast growing domestic markets position countries such as Brazil as strategic destinations for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and trade. Together with an absence of a propensity to innovate in pharmaceutical products, these conditions boost Brazil’s bargaining power for issuing compulsory licenses over pharmaceutical products. The second aspect is related to political economy dynamics inside Brazil. Accordingly, the political framework in Brazil undermines long-term policies and favors short-sighted ones also vis-a-vis R&D investments in the pharmaceutical industry. This remains true regardless of the strictness of the patent regime in place. The lesson of Brazil is relevant arguably for other more powerful developing countries which presently examine Brazil's approach while further challenging the WTO's strict patent policy for the future...|$|R
40|$|Illegal logging is a {{pervasive}} problem that causes enormous damage to forests, local communities and national economies. The EU {{is one of}} the largest markets for timber and forest products, but has virtually no legal means of preventing illegal imports. EU-level actions against illegal logging, such as they are, have been included in the European Commission´s Action Plan on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT), presented in May 2003. The aim of the Action Plan is to control the import of illegally sourced timber by developing bilateral or regional partnership agreements in order to create a caucus of the main wood-producing and importing countries. The agreements will stipulate that timber imports from partner countries must be harvested in conformity with their national legislation, before they can be imported into the EU. In order to control the import, the Commission must draft a regulation that will form the legal basis for a <b>voluntary</b> <b>licensing</b> scheme. As a first step towards such a system, the European Council adopted the Action Plan in October 2003. However, the Commission and the Council recognize that a significant number of producer countries are unlikely to enter into partnership agreements, and that illegal timber traders will import illegally sourced forest products via third countries that have no such agreements with the EU. The Council has therefore asked the Commission to review the options for - and the feasibility of - further legislation to control imports of illegally harvested timber. In reviewing further legislation, the Commission should note that illegal forest use is not just an outcome of poor governance but is often an integral part of local and national political economies. Revenues from illegal forest exploitation often serve to perpetuate existing political parties, policies and practices. There is a clear danger that EU efforts to curb illegal logging will unwittingly encourage national governments to water down their existing environmental laws rather than strengthen them. This could lead governments to weaken existing forest laws, or even to legalize currently illegal logging practices, in order to satisfy the EU. It is therefore essential to start a political dialogue with producer countries focusing not only on illegal forestry practices but also on forest sector reform, increasing transparency, strengthening land tenure and access rights, and reducing corruption. EU Member States have been asked to enter into discussions with producer countries and to report back to the Council by mid- 2004 on their readiness for, and their views on, partnership agreements. Their reports will form the basis for future debate on the Commission´s mandate to negotiate with interested partner countries. Moreover, the Council has asked the Commission to draft, also by mid- 2004, a regulation setting up a <b>voluntary</b> <b>licensing</b> scheme for identifying legal timber and wood products as part of the partnership agreements. mailto:saskia@fern. org Saskia Ozinga is coordinator at FERN (Forests and the European Union Resource Network).
