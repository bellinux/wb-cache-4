25|$|Some {{techniques}} of intensive agriculture may be cruel to animals: foie gras is a food product {{made from the}} liver of ducks or geese that have been force fed corn to fatten the organ; veal is criticised because the <b>veal</b> <b>calves</b> may be highly restricted in movement, have unsuitable flooring, spend their entire lives indoors, experience prolonged deprivation (sensory, social, and exploratory), and be more susceptible to high amounts of stress and disease.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Californians {{voted on}} Proposition 2, which {{requires}} California farmers to provide egg-laying hens, <b>veal</b> <b>calves,</b> and pregnant pigs with housing {{that gives them}} enough room to move around beginning January 1, 2015. The law would mostly impact the state's 18 million egg-laying hens. The current industry standards call for caged hens {{to get at least}} 67 square inches of space each, a little less than a regular-size sheet of paper, (a sheet of paper is 93.5 square inches) and hens are typically caged in groups of two to eight. Proposition 2 grew into the most expensive animal welfare ballot measure ever, with both sides raising nearly $8 million each. The measure passed with 63.2 percent of the vote.|$|E

5000|$|Nonformula-fed ("red" [...] or [...] "grain-fed") veal: Calves {{that are}} raised on grain, hay, or other solid food, in {{addition}} to milk. The meat is darker in colour, and some additional marbling and fat may be apparent. It is usually marketed as calf, rather than <b>veal.</b> The <b>calves</b> are slaughtered at 22 to 26 weeks of age weighing 650 to 700 lb.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{systems of}} <b>veal</b> {{production}} rear <b>calves</b> that are {{denied access to}} any solid feed and are fed a liquid milk replacer. They may also be deprived of bedding {{to prevent them from}} eating this. This dietary restriction completely distorts the normal development of the rumen and predisposes the calf to infectious enteritis (scouring or diarrhoea) and chronic indigestion. [...] Furthermore, calves with an underdeveloped gut {{are more likely to be}} found to have hairballs in the rumen at slaughter; the accumulation of hairballs in the rumen can impair digestion.|$|R
2500|$|Cattle {{raised for}} human {{consumption}} are called beef cattle. Within the beef cattle industry {{in parts of the}} United States, the term beef (plural beeves) is still used in its archaic sense to refer to an animal of either sex. Cows of certain breeds that are kept for the milk they give are called dairy cows or milking cows (formerly milch cows). [...] Most young male offspring of dairy cows are sold for veal, and may be referred to as <b>veal</b> <b>calves.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} American cattle kept in {{confined}} feedlot conditions fluctuates. From 1 January 2002 through 1 January 2012, {{there was no}} significant overall upward or downward trend in the number of US cattle on feed for slaughter, which averaged about 14.046 million head over that period. [...] Previously, the number had increased; it was 12.453 million in 1985. Cattle on feed (for slaughter) numbered about 14.121 million on 1 January 2012, i.e. about 15.5% of the estimated inventory of 90.8 million US cattle (including calves) on that date. [...] Of the 14.121 million, US cattle on feed (for slaughter) in operations with 1000 head or more were estimated to number 11.9 million. Cattle feedlots in this size category correspond to the regulatory definition of [...] "large" [...] concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) for cattle other than mature dairy cows or <b>veal</b> <b>calves.</b> [...] Significant numbers of dairy, as well as beef cattle, are confined in CAFOs, defined as [...] "new and existing operations which stable or confine and feed or maintain for a total of 45 days or more in any 12-month period more than the number of animals specified" [...] where [...] "rops, vegetation, forage growth, or post-harvest residues are not sustained in the normal growing season over any portion of the lot or facility." [...] They may be designated as small, medium and large. Such designation of cattle CAFOs is according to cattle type (mature dairy cows, <b>veal</b> <b>calves</b> or other) and cattle numbers, but medium CAFOs are so designated only if they meet certain discharge criteria, and small CAFOs are designated only on a case-by-case basis.|$|E
5000|$|A Mother's Day {{story about}} milk cows and <b>veal</b> <b>calves,</b> May 7, 2010 ...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] six Holstein bull calves were divided into six groups {{to determine the effect}} of protein degradability and rumen inert fat supplementation in starter and finishing diets on nutrient digestibility and <b>veal</b> production. <b>Calves</b> received low (LD) or high (HD) degradable protein diets, with or without rumen inert fat supplementation. Two commercial fat sources were used, Morlac (mlc) and Golden Flake (gf), included in the experimental diets at 2. 5 % of dry matter (DM). A commercial milk replacer was fed to all calves at 4 L/day for 42 days, followed by 2 L/day until weaning at 49 days of age. Starter diets were offered ad lib. from day 14 to 10 weeks of age and finishing diets ad lib. from 11 to 20 weeks of age. All calves were slaughtered at 20 weeks to determine carcass weight and dressing percentage. There {{were no significant differences in}} body weight gain or dry matter intake over the entire 20 week period. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was improved when fat was supplemented to LD, but not to HD diets. The FCR (DM intake/kg gain) of LD, HD, LDmlc, HDmlc, LDgf and HDgf diets was 3. 45, 3. 44, 3. 07, 3. 81, 3. 02 and 3. 43, respectively. All 36 calves were used in a digestibility trial during week 18 of the study, using chromium oxide as a marker. Apparent digestibility values (%) for LD, HD, LDmlc, HDmlc, LDgf and HDgf, respectively, were 61. 7, 65. 9, 75. 4, 69. 0, 75. 5 and 67. 2 for DM, 61. 4, 61. 6, 71. 3, 68. 2, 75. 4 and 66. 1 for crude protein and 58. 6, 66. 5, 76. 0, 70. 9, 78. 4 and 70. 8 for fat. Dry matter and fat digestibilities were significantly higher when fat was added to LD diets, but not to HD diets. The CP digestibility was significantly higher when fat was added to either the LD or the HD diets. It was concluded that rumen inert fat supplementation to calf diets appears to improve feed conversion ratio and DM and fat digestibilities, but only when added to low degradable protein diets and only after 10 weeks of age. Crude protein digestibility appears to improve with fat supplementation to either high or low degradable protein diets. Publishers' versio...|$|R

50|$|One {{aspect of}} veal {{production}} cited as cruelty in the industry, {{is the lack}} of space <b>veal</b> <b>calves</b> are provided. Space is often deliberately restricted by the producer to stop the animal exercising as this makes the meat turn redder and tougher.|$|E
5000|$|Special-fed veal: Calves are fed a {{balanced}} milk or soy-based diet, fortified with 40 essential nutrients, including essential amino acids, carbohydrates, fats, dietary iron and other dietary minerals and vitamins.

50|$|On October 15, 1974, Curtiss was {{the site}} of a protest by the National Farmers Organization (NFO). NFO farmers {{slaughtered}} and buried in a trench 638 calves, mostly less than two weeks old. The protest was in response to the low price of veal. At the time, <b>veal</b> <b>calves</b> were selling for $0.17 per pound, resulting in a net loss to the farmer due to high feed costs. Public backlash against the NFO and the protest was great, with President Ford weighing in to call it senseless. In 1976, the US EPA aided the village with a grant to establish a municipal sewer and water system. The system was expanded in the 1990s and again in the 2000s to account for industrial growth related to the meat packing industry.|$|E
5000|$|Veal crates are a close-confinement {{system of}} raising <b>veal</b> <b>calves.</b> Many calves raised for veal, {{including}} in Canada and the US, are confined in crates which typically measure approximately 66-76 cm (2.1-2.5 ft) wide. The calves are housed individually and the crates usually prevent physical contact between adjacent calves, and often prevent visual contact. [...] Crated calves are sometimes {{tied to the}} front of the crate with a short tether which restricts almost all movement. Floors are often slatted and sloped. This allows urine and manure to fall under the crate to help maintain a clean environment for the calf. In some veal crate systems, the calves are also kept in the dark without bedding and fed nothing but milk. [...] Veal crates are designed to limit movement of the animal because meat turns redder and tougher if the animals are allowed to exercise. The diet is sometimes highly regulated to remove sources of iron, which again makes the meat redder.|$|E
50|$|New Moor Farm, run by John Archer and {{his father}} Robert, {{previously}} kept Holstein Friesians but the herd {{was lost in the}} 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis. Today it is run by John and Susan Archer and is known in Darlington for its Archers ice cream which has been made on the premises in two converted garages and an old forge since 2004 using 4% of the milk from the Jersey herd of 330 cows. The cattle are descendants from three herds in Cornwall, Hampshire and Jersey. In summer 2005 an ice cream parlour was opened at the farm, and that Christmas it offered Christmas pudding ice cream. In 2005 the farm sold 4000 L of ice cream, and the following year it sold 8000 L. In 2006 the farm had a milk quota of 1500000 L and it was processed by Acorn Dairy at Archdeacon Newton. In 2007 the farm supplied 90 litres of milk a day to Flamingoland to feed a new−born Rothschild giraffe which had been rejected by its mother. New Moor Farm was one of the farms which took part in the fourth annual Open Farm Sunday in May 2008. In 2008 the farm opened another ice cream parlour at The Station in Richmond. In 2009 the ice cream received the Taste of the North−East of England accreditation in the 2009 North−East England Tourism Awards. In 2010 a second business, Newmoor Veal, was started because the herd produces 150 male calves a year, many of which would previously be shot at birth because they are considered unsuitable for beef production. The new production company allows the <b>veal</b> <b>calves</b> to be suckled by their mothers and to live for seven months.|$|E
