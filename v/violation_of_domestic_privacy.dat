40|$|The {{formative}} {{influence on}} Frances Burney’s {{work of the}} artistic-professional context of her upbringing has only recently begun to be recognised. As I argue elsewhere, early experiences in her father’s musical household informed Burney’s construction of a literary identity that balanced her professionally specialised labour with an aesthetic <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>privacy.</b> In Memoirs <b>of</b> Doctor Burney, Burney apparently collapses this separation by using her professionally specialised abilities in combination with her own intimate, domestic experience to construct a public version of her father, Charles Burney, as a polite, sociable man-of-letters rather than a musical professional. In Memoirs, Burney uses biography {{as a vehicle for}} the establishment of her own literary authority. In rewriting her father from artisanal musician to man-of-letters, she establishes an artistic-professional genealogy in which to site her own literary genius. Most significantly, Burney enacts final creative authority over her father, re-casting inheritance as evolution. Burney simultaneously invokes and obscures her family history in a biography of her father that is indistinguishable from the narrative of her own creative development...|$|R

Drawing on rational choice theory and empirical evidence, we argue that the resulting payoff structures, negative for the majority of successful claimants, strike at the very essence of these rights. The measures are furthermore disproportionate in light of the Government’s stated policy aims: fees have failed to transfer costs away from taxpayers, have failed to encourage early dispute resolution, and have failed to deter vexatious litigants.

40|$|Filartiga v. Pena-Irala {{established}} {{the idea that}} domestic tort suits might be brought under the Alien Tort Claims Act (2 ̆ 2 ATCA 2 ̆ 2) against those accused of violating human rights norms. But what is the legacy of this case {{in an era of}} military privatization? Are there available legal responses to what we might call the privatization of torture? In the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, where detainees were tortured and abused, the individuals involved in the torture included not only members of the military, but contractors hired from the private sector. Because U. S. constitutional scrutiny traditionally applies only to state actors, privatization has been seen as potentially undermining constitutional oversight. Moreover, because many international human rights are framed as rights against state overreaching, the turn to private actors might appear to present a significant problem for legal accountability. Yet, military outsourcing may not, by itself, pose quite as serious an impediment to accountability. To the contrary, human rights abuses by private contractors may actually be more readily subject to legal action than abuses by official governmental actors, both through civil suits under the ATCA to redress <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> international human rights law, and through civil and criminal litigation to redress <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> law. Using the Abu Ghraib prison abuse as a case study, this Essay will compare the possible forms of legal accountability for official governmental actors and private contractors, and suggest that the latter are at least as likely, and perhaps more likely, {{to be held accountable for}} abuses...|$|R

40|$|Ankara : Türk Edebiyatı Bölümü,Bilkent University, 2007. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2007. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 114 - 119. Ziya Osman Saba {{assigned a}} prominent place to house and home in his poetry. For this reason he is considered the first domestic poet in Turkish literature by several critics. In the present thesis, themes relating {{to the house and}} home in his poetry are approached from three aspects: the modernity and tradition dichotomy, home as a shelter and source of happiness, and sexuality. The references to the types of modern and traditional life styles and perceptions have been identified. In this section, it is concluded that the house in Saba’s poetry taken literally and metaphorically, is indicative of a longing for traditional rather than modern life style. In the poems, it is recognized that the interior and the exterior, with specific references to furniture, family, neigbours, the garden and outside of the house and different city spaces, an empasis is placed on the dissapearing tradition. In Part II. titled “Taking Shelter, and Happiness”, it is observed that the poet takes refuge in his house and feels intense happiness and comfort, and two main reasons for this are identified. First, the turmoil caused by modernity, and the second is the desire to take refuge from natural dangers. In the poems, the house and the family always bear positive meanings, and the ideal house seems as the source of all happiness. This is also an important difference between Ziya Osman Saba and the another Turkish domestic poet, Behçet Necatigil. Lastly, the relationship between sexuality and the house in terms <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> space and family is studied. Subsequently, with reference to various views on this subject it is shown that sexuality always goes with familial intimacy. On the other hand, {{it is clear that the}} poet somewhat covers up the sexuality aspect in a number of poems which he did not publish in his books. It is observed that the sexual aspect <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>privacy</b> is not expressed in detail, but given to the reader in terms of a covert style. Demirel, Serhat/M. S...|$|R
40|$|Development {{has been}} a right in Africa since African leaders made the {{commitment}} thereto at {{the adoption of the}} African Charter on Human and People's Rights in 1981. Yet, in Africa, the majority of women cannot exercise citizenship rights because of the manner in which their society view them and, sometimes, even because of the way women view themselves. Development in critical aspects of {{the lives of the people}} is regarded as one of the envisaged products of constitutional democratic institutions. Women are at most times relegated to the status of "second class citizens" who only operate within the private spheres. While regional human rights instruments have made remarkable gains in ensuring that women within the region are protected, there is, however, a disconnect between the rights enshrined in the instruments and the daily reality of the majority of women. The majority of African countries are still far from creating an egalitarian society where men and women have equal opportunity and access to benefits. In this article, the authors argue that the conduct of governments in protecting the substantive rights of the majority of women in Africa is in total <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>domestic,</b> regional and international law. Nigeria, for example, is committed to the protection of the human rights of all its citizens. However, citizenship rights in Nigeria do not seek to promote and protect the substantive rights of the majority of women. The implication is the complete erosion of dignity and fundamental rights. In other words, the majority of women lose the essence of the inherent membership of their society. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{protection against}} risks as material and social phenomena among the Ammarin tribe in Petra – a settled Bedouin community in southern Jordan. By examining the active role of material {{culture that is}} often disregarded in risk studies, the thesis discusses how protective strategies are entangled in cultural, religious, and national identities. Using ethnographic methods, I investigate protection against selected risks: harm from evil eyes, <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> sanctity, and cultural heritage dilapidation. Protection against these risks is examined through studies of architecture, the social use of luminosity, prophylactic items, saint veneration, Qur’anic items, and heritage production. The thesis challenges the preoccupation with “meaning” in material culture studies, by focusing on conceptualizations of “presence” and “absence” as equally important to protective efficacy. Some informants, for example, adopt an orthodox scriptural Islamic approach to protection and denounce certain material registers as un-Islamic and materialistic leftovers from an ignorant past, and rather prescribe Qur’anic remembrance. For other informants the very physicality of such contested strategies are confirming their efficacy, and act as material anchors for negotiating Bedouin identities {{in response to a}} rapid transformation from nomadic pastoralists to sedentary wageworkers. The tensions surrounding the materiality of protection, along with the role of the past in the present is further investigated through the contested public representations of Ammarin culture, along with a detailed study of the process leading to the protection of Bedouin culture by UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. The overall conclusion of this research is that negotiating efficacious protection against perceived risks, is about actively taking a stance on senses of exposure, vulnerability and uncertainty towards the people, places and things that are cherished. These strategies simultaneously act as potent public exposure of social, religious, and national moral identities that may empower, exclude, or ostracize people...|$|R
40|$|The Fick case {{which was}} {{decided by the}} Constitutional Court on 27 June 2013 {{was the first time}} since its {{inception}} that the Constitutional Court was confronted with the status of a binding international decision within the domestic legal order. It concerned a binding decision by the (now suspended) Southern African Development Community (SADC) Tribunal against Zimbabwe, which was also enforceable in South Africa. A key issue before the Court was whether or not the South African statutory rules of civil procedure for the enforcement of foreign judgments also covered judgments of international courts and tribunals (as anticipated by Article 32 (1) of the Protocol on the SADC Tribunal). As none of the relevant statutory legislation was applicable in this instance, the common law remained the only possible avenue through which the SADC Tribunal’s decision could be enforced in South Africa. At the time of the decision, the common law on the enforcement of civil judgments had developed only to a point where it provided for the execution of judgments made by <b>domestic</b> courts <b>of</b> a foreign state (ie decisions of other national courts). The Court was therefore confronted with whether or not an international decision {{in the form of a}} cost order of the SADC Tribunal amounted to a “foreign judgment” as recognized by the South African common law. The Court answered this question in the affirmative by relying on those clauses in the Constitution that committed South Africa to the rule of law, as well as its obligations under international law, and to an international-law friendly interpretation <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> law. Although the decision is to be welcomed and applied the law correctly to the facts of the case, it does raise the issue of the wisdom of equating international judgments with foreign judgments on a more general scale. This relates to the fact that it is generally accepted in most jurisdictions that the recognition and enforcement of a “foreign judgment” can be denied where it would result in a <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> public policy. The public policy exception does not, however, fit well in a regime based on public international law, which does not permit States to use their domestic law as an excuse for not implementing their international obligations. ...|$|R

Contrariety investment climate in Ukraine is connected to the incomplete market institutional reforms, high levels of arbitrary interference by public authorities in the financial business and their corruption, backwardness of market infrastructure and others. This narrowness and financial market away from the main countries of the world financial capital flows. In the future, if we proceed with economic realities and financial market development level of countries with transitional economic expansion is possible in these countries to attract foreign capital. Total foreign capital inflows can have both positive and negative consequences for social and economic development. Receiving positive effects depends on the ratio between import and export of capital, foreign capital forms, directions using borrowed funds and others. The most common way of attracting foreign direct investment in real sector of economy of business is selling shares to foreign companies. Please be aware that the country in transition (non-) economics is 'fit' in global financial processes, following their own capacity for sustainable development.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a post-occupancy evaluation of Claremont Court housing scheme involving an original {{examination of the}} experience of its current dwellers. Basil Spence designed Claremont Court (1959 - 62) as part of the City of Edinburgh Corporation Housing Committee’s post-war housing drive. The post-war housing policy in Scotland was aimed to offer people better living conditions than those endured for so long in the slums as the legacy of the Industrial Revolution, and therefore Modernist architects were encouraged to experiment with new spatial layouts (Powers 2005). Although Claremont Court {{has been described as a}} civilized example of Modernist social housing (McWilliam et al. 1984; Gillon and McDowell 2010), we argue that its relevance relies on the fact that it acknowledged the contemporary cross-class desire <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>privacy</b> and <b>domestic</b> forms <b>of</b> leisure. Despite the appalling living conditions of the slums, the experience of the post-war housing estates damaged the Modernist belief that better housing would necessarily result in a better society (Gold 2007). Jacobs (1961) challenged low-density suburban planning and functional zoning just after Young and Willmott (1957) provided an influential evaluation of post-war housing in London, criticising the sense of social isolation of residents and loss of community. These led to a renewed self-image of the architect as social engineer: Noble’s contention (1963) that architecture could shape the user’s behaviour believed on the meanings imposed by the architect. On the contrary, our research focuses on the users and aims to read the meaning of Claremont Court for its current dwellers. Our methodology is qualitative in nature, and it is supported by an initial analysis of archival material and relevant architectural and sociological literature, followed by the thematic analysis of in-depth interviews of a group of dwellers and the contextual mapping of their flats. Following Rapoport’s theory of nonverbal communication (1982), we decode contextual mappings to read people’s belongings in terms of their meaning and make inferences about the dwellers’ living patterns. The paper makes an original contribution to the literature by developing the first in-depth post-occupancy evaluation of Claremont Court through the examination of the spatial practices of its current dwellers. It argues that while the scheme responded to the growing desire for new types of home in the Britain of the 1960 s, the design of its dwelling units seems able to successfully support the living patterns of its dwellers more than fifty years later. By highlighting those spatial features that mostly meet the needs of the current dwellers, our paper aims to inform future social housing design...|$|R

In addition, we explored possible management options from policy makers, and enabling factors of and barriers to the routine screening <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> violence. Semi-structured key informant interviews were conducted with doctors (n =  25) working in public and private hospitals and with officials involved in domestic violence policy development (n =  5) in Islamabad, Pakistan.

Enabling factors included doctors' ability to build rapport and trust with women and their suggestion that further education of both healthcare providers and women would be beneficial. However, domestic violence is often perceived as a "family issue" that is not routinely discussed by healthcare providers. Lack of resources, lack of consultation time and lack of effective referral pathways or support were identified as the main barriers to the provision of quality care.
