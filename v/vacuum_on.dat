25|$|Watt's next {{improvement}} to the Newcomen {{design was}} {{to seal the}} top of the cylinder and surround the cylinder with a jacket. Steam was passed through the jacket before being admitted below the piston, keeping the piston and cylinder warm to prevent condensation within it. The second improvement was the utilisation of steam expansion against the <b>vacuum</b> <b>on</b> {{the other side of the}} piston. The steam supply was cut during the stroke, and the steam expanded against the <b>vacuum</b> <b>on</b> the other side. This increased the efficiency of the engine, but also created a variable torque on the shaft which was undesirable for many applications, in particular pumping. Watt therefore limited the expansion to a ratio of 1:2 (i.e. the steam supply was cut at half stroke). This increased the theoretical efficiency from 6.4% to 10.6%, with only a small variation in piston pressure. Watt did not use high pressure steam because of safety concerns.|$|E

Prior to Howard's dumping, when Peacock was the shadow treasurer, Hewson had been seen as the real shadow treasurer. In the lead up to the 1990 election, Hewson, the trained economist, performed well against the then-Treasurer Paul Keating. Hewson claimed in December 1989 that Keating was reluctant to debate with him on the economy.|$|E
25|$|Even when {{a system}} is entirely {{isolated}} from external influences, its microstate is constantly changing. For instance, the particles in a gas are constantly moving, and thus occupy a different position at each moment of time; their momenta are also constantly changing as they collide with each other or with the container walls. Suppose we prepare the system in an artificially highly ordered equilibrium state. For instance, imagine dividing a container with a partition and placing a gas {{on one side of}} the partition, with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>on</b> the other side. If we remove the partition and watch the subsequent behavior of the gas, we will find that its microstate evolves according to some chaotic and unpredictable pattern, and that on average these microstates will correspond to a more disordered macrostate than before. It is possible, but extremely unlikely, for the gas molecules to bounce off one another in such a way that they remain in one half of the container. It is overwhelmingly probable for the gas to spread out to fill the container evenly, which is the new equilibrium macrostate of the system.|$|E

Himmler himself visited Białystok on 30 June 1941 and pronounced that more forces were needed in the area, because the massive chase after the fleeing Red Army left behind a security <b>vacuum.</b> <b>On</b> 3 July additional formation of Schutzpolizei arrived in the city from the General Government, led by SS-Hauptsturmführer Wolfgang Birkner, veteran of Einsatzgruppe IV from the Polish Campaign. The relief unit, called kommando Bialystok, was sent in by SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer Eberhard Schöngarth on orders from the Reich Main Security Office, due to reports of Soviet guerrilla activity in the area with Jews being of course immediately suspected of helping them out. On 10 July 1941 Schaper's Einsatzgruppe was subdivided into dozens of smaller commandos (Einsatzkommandos) numbering from several to several scores of people whose mission was to kill Jews, alleged communists and the Soviet NKVD collaborators in the captured territories often far behind the advancing German front. The entire Einsatzgruppe employed the same, systematic method of mass killing across many Polish villages and towns {{in the vicinity of}} Białystok. Schaper's murderous rampage south-east of East Prussia is fairly well documented, and included Wizna (end of June), Wąsosz (5 July), Radziłów (7 July), Jedwabne (10 July), Łomża (early August), Tykocin (22–25 August), Rutki (4 September), Piątnica, Zambrów as well as other locations.|$|E

500|$|Despite an {{incomplete}} {{understanding of the}} principles behind them, in some ways Evans's thinking {{about the potential for}} steam engines was once again far ahead of its time. In the postscript of the Steam Engineer's Guide, Evans noted that drawing a <b>vacuum</b> <b>on</b> water reduces its boiling point and cools it. He further observed that a vacuum would have the same effect upon ether, and the resulting cooling should be sufficient to produce ice. He went on to describe a piston vacuum pump apparatus to produce this effect, and also showed that a compression cylinder, or the compression stroke of the vacuum pump, should produce heat in a condenser. Thus Evans had produced the first detailed and theoretically coherent design for a vapor-compression refrigerator, identifying all the major components (expander, cooling coil, compressor and condenser) of a refrigeration cycle, leaving some to credit him as the 'grandfather of refrigeration'. [...] Although Evans never developed a working model of his designs, and {{there is no evidence that}} he ever attempted to, Evans in his later life worked and associated extensively with fellow inventor Jacob Perkins on steam engines and the potential for refrigeration. Perkins would later develop and build a refrigeration device for which he received patents in 1834–1835, employing much the same principles originally put forward by Evans.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain the full {{capacity}} of cementitious materials incorporated in ultra-high performance fibre-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) a heat curing can be applied. This method represents a high cost for the manufacturer. Therefore other techniques that increase the mechanical performance are interesting. Vacuum mixing is a new technology that can improve the compressive strength of such mixtures. Research is necessary to check whether it can replace the expensive heat treatment. We compared both techniques for several mixtures. This paper reports the effect of <b>vacuum</b> mixing <b>on</b> the compressive strength and splitting tensile strength of UHPFRC.
