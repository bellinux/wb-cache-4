40|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> (VIGV) is used {{to control}} the mass flow and {{generate}} prewhirl in centrifugal compressors. Due to the tip clearance of the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> and the defect of the traditional <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> profiles, the mass flow regulation of VIGV is limited, resulting in a large waste of compressed gas.

50|$|One SST VCE {{concept is}} the Tandem Fan engine. The engine has two fans, both {{mounted on the}} {{low-pressure}} shaft, with a significant axial gap between the units. In normal flight, the engine is in the series mode, with the flow leaving the front fan passing directly into the second fan, the engine behaving much like a normal turbofan. However, for take-off, climb-out, final-descent and approach, the front fan is allowed to discharge directly through an auxiliary nozzle {{on the underside of}} the powerplant nacelle. Auxiliary intakes are opened on each side of the powerplant, allowing air to enter the rear fan and progress through the rest of the engine. Operating the fans in this parallel mode substantially increases the total airflow of the engine at a thrust, resulting in a lower jet velocity and a quieter engine. Back in the 1970s, Boeing modified a Pratt & Whitney JT8D to a Tandem Fan configuration and successfully demonstrated the switch from series to parallel operation (and vice versa) with the engine running, albeit at part power. In the Mid Tandem Fan concept, a high specific flow single stage fan is located between the high pressure (HP) and low pressure (LP) compressors of a turbojet core. Only bypass air is allowed to pass through the fan, the LP compressor exit flow passing through special passages within the fan disc, directly underneath the fan rotor blades. Some of the bypass air enters the engine via an auxiliary intake. During take-off and approach the engine behaves much like a normal civil turbofan, with an acceptable jet noise level (i.e., low specific thrust). However, for supersonic cruise, the fan <b>variable</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> and auxiliary intake close-off to minimize bypass flow and increase specific thrust. In this mode the engine acts more like a 'leaky' turbojet (e.g. the F404).|$|E
