40|$|Intended {{to improve}} the quality of social studies teacher {{education}} coursework, this paper discusses the use of interactive <b>videodisks</b> in understanding cultural diversity. Beginning with a review of studies about using <b>videodisks,</b> the paper describes the strategies for content development derived from interviews with 15 subject matter experts and a review of the published literature. Learner characteristics were analyzed by means of a survey of 90 undergraduate students at the University of Minnesota College of Education and Human Services Professions. The survey contained sections related to tolerance and discrimination issues, content background, and demographic characteristics. Upon completion of learner analyses and content development, the development of objectives, flow charts, and specific content in the form of modules was carried out.

50|$|The most {{thorough}} audience appraisal {{carried out}} by the Library of Congress consisted of an end-user evaluation conducted in 1992-1993. Forty-four school, college and university, and state and public libraries were provided with a dozen American Memory collections on CD-ROMs and <b>videodisks</b> (these formats are no longer being supported). Participating library staff, teachers, students and the public were polled about which digitized materials they had used and how well the delivery systems worked. The evaluation indicated continued interest by institutions of higher education as well as public libraries. The surprising finding, however, was the strong showing of enthusiasm in schools, especially at the secondary level. Library Science students however should be more wary of such a development given the potential for unwarranted changes being made to the collection.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{comprehensive}} and revolutionary {{use of new}} technology to plan movie sequences came from Francis Ford Coppola, who in making his 1982 musical feature One From the Heart, developed the process he called “electronic cinema”. Through electronic cinema Coppola sought to provide the filmmaker with on-set composing tools that would function {{as an extension of}} his thought processes. [...] For the first time, an animatic would be the basis for an entire feature film. The process began with actors performing a dramatic [...] "radio-style" [...] voice recording of the entire script. Storyboard artists then drew more than 1800 individual storyboard frames. These drawings were then recorded onto analog <b>videodisks</b> and edited according to the voice recordings. [...] Once production began, video taken from the video tap of the 35 mm camera(s) shooting the actual movie was used to gradually replace storyboarded stills to give the director a more complete vision of the film’s progress.|$|R

This work included the planning and testing of systems and circuits proposed for adoption by the National Television System Committee (NTSC).Between 1960 and 1970 Mr. Pritchard worked developing video processing circuitry for color TV receivers, colorimetry and decoder matrix methods, information display techniques, and analog techniques employing charge-coupled devices for TV applications.

5000|$|Since {{the late}} 1960s, Engelmann has {{authored}} more than 100 curricular programs, {{based on the}} principles that were discovered in the preschool. The first programs, written from 1968 through 1970 were called DISTAR, for Direct Instruction System for Teaching and Remediation, and were designed to teach reading, math, and language to children in kindergarten through second grade. The DISTAR materials were used in some locations that participated in Project Follow Through, the largest educational experiment {{in the history of}} the United States. Follow Through, which was sponsored by the U.S. Office of Education, began in 1968 and continued into the 1970s. The project targeted primary school children in communities with high levels of poverty. In subsequent years, the original DISTAR programs were expanded from the original three levels to include six levels. These programs are currently called Reading Mastery and Connecting Math Concepts. He also developed a multilevel reading program for students beyond the primary level, including adults, who performed lower than others (Corrective Reading Decoding and Corrective Reading Comprehension), programs to teach writing and spelling (Reasoning and Writing and Spelling Mastery), and a <b>videodisk</b> series to teach math and science to middle school students (including Chemistry and Energy and Elementary Earth Science). Programs were also written for parents to use with their children, Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons [...] and Give your Child a Superior Mind. Most recently he has developed computer-based programs that parents and others can use to teach young children reading and math skills (Funnix Beginning Reading and Funnix Beginning Math), as well as programs to teach English speaking skills to non-native English speakers at third grade or older (Direct Instruction Spoken English).|$|E

40|$|Many {{clinical}} practice guidelines fail {{to account for}} the preferences of the individual patient. Approaches that seek to include the preferences of the individual patient in the decision-making process (e. g., interactive <b>videodisks</b> for patient education), however, may incur sub-stantial incremental costs. Developers of {{clinical practice}} guidelines must therefore determine whether it is appropriate to make their guidelines flexible with regard to patient preferences. The authors present a formal method for determining the cost-effectiveness of incorporating the preferences of individual patients into clinical practice guidelines. Based on utilities assessed from 37 patients, they apply the method in the setting of mild hypertension. In this example, they estimate that the cost-effectiveness ratio for individualized utility assessment is $ 48, 565 per quality-adjusted year of life, a ratio that compares favorably with other health interventions that are promoted actively. This approach, which can be applied to any clinical domain, offers a formal method for determining whether the incorporation of individual patient preferences is important clinically and is justified economically.

40|$|Background: Some Mayan peasant-hunters {{across the}} Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico still {{carry out a}} hunting ritual –Loojil Ts’oon, Loj Ts’oon or Carbine Ceremony – in which they renew the divine {{permission}} for hunting {{in order to continue}} deserving the gift of prey after a period of hunt. Thus they are granted access to game by the gods and the Lords of the Animals, particularly the spirit/evil-wind call. This paper focuses on the acts within the Loojil Ts’oon –which is performed in the X-Pichil community and surrounding area – that make it unique among the hunting rituals performed {{in other parts of the}} Peninsula. Methods: The Loojil Ts’oon hunting ritual was observed and registered in audiovisual format in two different occasions in X-Pichil (Friday 04 / 29 / 2011 and Friday 07 / 29 / 2011). Afterwards, we delivered digital <b>videodisks</b> (DVD) to hunters and their families and to the j-men (the magic-medic-ritual specialist) who participated in these ceremonies. This delivery produced confidence among participants to talk more openly and in-depth about the Loojil Ts’oon, revealing symbolic, psychological, and material details previously unknown to outsiders. Qualitative information was obtained through the ethnographic method using techniques such as participant observation and guided tours. Semi-structured interviews were carried out to obtain complementary information. Results and discussion: On one hand, we describe the preparation and cleansing of the “Sip soup”, as well as it...|$|R
