40|$|Hydraulic risk maps {{provide the}} {{baseline}} for {{land use and}} emergency planning. Accordingly, they should convey clear information on the potential physical implications of the different hazards to the stakeholders. This paper presents a <b>vulnerability</b> <b>criterion</b> focused on human stability in a ﬂow speciﬁcally devised for rapidly evolving ﬂoods where life, before than economic values, might be threatened. The human body is conceptualized {{as a set of}} cylinders and its stability to slipping and toppling is assessed by forces and moments equilibrium. Moreover, a depth threshold to consider drowning is assumed. In order to widen its scope of application, the model takes the destabilizing effect of local slope (so far disregarded in the literature) and ﬂuid density into account. The resulting vulnerability classiﬁcation could be naturally sub- divided in three levels (low, medium, and high) that are limited by two stability curves for children and adults, respectively. In comparison with the most advanced literature conceptual approaches, the proposed model is weakly parameterized and the computed thresholds ﬁt better the available experimental data sets. A code that implements the proposed algorithm is provided...|$|R
40|$|Working paper series, African Development Bank Group, Working paper n° 103 The African Development Bank allocates its {{concessional}} resources through a procedure which is mainly {{based on the}} quality of the beneficiary countries' economic policy and governance. This allocation procedure relies mainly on the Performance-Based Allocation formula which can be criticized on two grounds. Firstly, the weight on economic policy and governance is viewed as being excessive. Secondly, it lacks transparency and consistency. We consider how to amend that formula so as to take into account certain common characteristics of many African countries. The main proposal is to augment the formula by an economic <b>vulnerability</b> <b>criterion.</b> The numerical simulations show that the introduction of the United Nations economic vulnerability index in the formula gives rise to allocations which not only account for post conflict situations but also inherent fragility. We also consider a lower population weight in order to address the problem of country size. This change helps avoid inconsistencies arising from the application of country allocation ceilings in the various stages of the computation. Finally, a few proposals concerning the African Development Fund's support to regional integration are explored...|$|R

5|$|Although this species' {{population}} {{now appears}} to be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation <b>vulnerability</b> <b>criteria.</b> Given its high numbers, this petrel is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern. The perceived decline may be due increased predation from gulls, skuas and introduced mammals. Eradication of rats protects seabird colonies and may enable recolonisation of islands cleared of rodents. Predation of cave-nesting petrels in the Balearics by yellow-legged gulls is restricted to relatively few individual gulls specialising in this prey item; this means that the problems can be controlled by selective culling and the provision of plastic nest boxes.|$|E

It has the following five parts. (1) The Project Plan describes {{the genesis of the}} project, sets forth the goals, objectives and scope, provides definitions, the projected schedule, and elements of protocol. (2) The Assessment Plan provides a detailed methodology necessary to guide the many professionals who have been recruited to conduct the DOE-wide assessment. It provides guidance on which types and forms of plutonium are to be considered within the scope of the assessment, and lays out the assessment methodology to be used. (3) The memorandum from the Project to Operations Office Managers provides the protocol and direction for participation in the assessment by external stakeholders and members of the public; and the guidance for the physical inspection of plutonium materials in storage. (4) The memorandum from the Project to the assessment teams provides guidance for <b>vulnerability</b> screening <b>criteria,</b> <b>vulnerability</b> evaluation and prioritization process, and vulnerability quantification for prioritization.

40|$|The {{software}} engineering tools historically {{used to examine}} faults {{can also be used}} to examine vulnerabilities and the rate at which they are discovered. I discuss the challenges of the collection process and compare two sets of <b>vulnerability</b> characterization <b>criteria.</b> I collected fifty-four months of vulnerability data for OpenBSD 2. 2 and applied seven reliability growth models to the two data sets. These models only passed applicability tests for the data set that omits dependent data points. Musa’s Logarithmic model has the best one-step-ahead predictive accuracy of the three acceptably accurate models for that data set. It estimated that fifty-four months after OpenBSD 2. 2 ’s release, the mean time to vulnerability discovery for OpenBSD 2. 2 was 42. 5 days and that 58. 4 % of the vulnerabilities it contains had been found. However, a trend analysis cannot rule out the possibility that there is no trend at all in the rate of vulnerability detection, and this result casts doubts on the accuracy of the reliability growth models. The lack of a clear decreasing trend in that analysis highlights one of the challenges of using reliability growth models on vulnerability data: it may be a true reflection of the system or it may be caused by the changes over time in the effort invested in vulnerability detection...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although {{policies}} and guidelines {{make use of}} the concept of vulnerability, few define it. The European Union's directive for clinical trials does not include explanations for or the reasoning behind the designation of certain groups as vulnerable. Emerging economies from lower middle-income countries have, in recent years, had the largest average annual growth rate, as well as increase, in number of clinical trials registered in the US government's database. Nevertheless, careful supervision of research activities has to be ensured. Objective: To describe and analyze the features of the clinical trials involving vulnerable populations in various countries classified by development status and geographic region. Methods: Retrospective study that involved analysis of data obtained from the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) database between 01 / 2014 and 12 / 2014 from countries with (i) highest trial densities during 2005 to 2012, (ii) highest average growth rate in clinical trials, and (iii) greatest trial capabilities. Results: Statistical analysis of this study showed that patients incapable of giving consent personally are 11. 4 {{times more likely to be}} vulnerable patients than patients who are capable, and that patients in upper-middle-income countries are 1. 7 times more likely to be vulnerable patients than patients from high-income countries when participating in global clinical trials. Malaysia (21 %), Egypt (20 %), Turkey (19 %), Israel (18 %), and Brazil (17 %) had the highest percentages of vulnerable populations involving children. Conclusions: Although the inability to provide consent personally was a factor associated with <b>vulnerability,</b> arbitrary <b>criteria</b> may have been considered when classifying the populations of clinical trials as vulnerable. The EU Clinical Trials Register should provide guidance regarding exactly what aspects or factors should be taken into account to frame given populations as vulnerable, because vulnerability is not applicable to all risk situations...|$|R
