The primary proposal included a comprehensive ban <b>verified</b> <b>by</b> control posts under national command, but international supervision, and required on-site inspections. This {{was rejected by}} the Soviet Union due to the inspection requirement. The alternative proposal included a partial test ban—underground tests would be excluded—to be <b>verified</b> <b>by</b> national detection mechanisms, without supervision by a supranational body.|$|E
