30|$|As {{different}} user applications {{have different}} sensitivities {{to the same}} network attribute (for example, real-time <b>voice</b> <b>applications</b> need the lowest bandwidth guarantee, video applications can adjust the resolution based on the bandwidth, and data applications expect larger bandwidth), this paper therefore divides user applications into three categories based on the service characteristics: inelastic, partially elastic, and perfectly elastic, which will be represented by <b>voice</b> <b>applications,</b> video applications, and data applications, respectively. In addition, this paper assumes that an end user can only run {{any one of these}} three applications.|$|R
50|$|If {{the speech}} recognizer {{returned}} just a string containing the actual words spoken by the user, the <b>voice</b> <b>application</b> {{would have to}} do the tedious job of extracting the semantic meaning from those words. For this reason, SRGS grammars can be decorated with tag elements, which when executed, build up the semantic result. SRGS does not specify the contents of the tag elements: this is done in a companion W3C standard, Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition (SISR). SISR is based on ECMAScript, and ECMAScript statements inside the SRGS tags build up an ECMAScript semantic result object that is easy for the <b>voice</b> <b>application</b> to process.|$|E

40|$|Voice User Interfaces (VUI) are a {{relatively}} new concept, although <b>voice</b> <b>applications</b> {{have been around for}} several years now. The invisible and transient character of sound led to believe that there was no user interface. This misconception rapidly disappeared with the technology advances that triggered the development of novel and rich <b>voice</b> <b>applications</b> for corporate use as well as in cars, phones and everyday appliances. The new and more complex functionality became a whole area known as Voice User Interfaces to address the di erent design forces and complexities behind a voice-based user interface. In the last years we began a pattern language for designing <b>voice</b> <b>applications</b> and documenting the aforementioned design tensions and common practices. In this paper, we continue with this work focusing on more complex issues such as authentication and consumer appliances interfaces. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} {{work has}} demonstrated that resource dimensioning based on steady-state performance analysis can not provide reliable QOS guarantee for packet <b>voice</b> <b>applications.</b> We propose a bandwidth and buffer dimensioning mechanism for support of voice connections in packet-switched networks, which can provide transient QOS guarantee for individual voice connections while keeping statistical multiplexing gain relatively high. 1 Introduction To support <b>voice</b> <b>applications</b> in packet-switched networks such as the Internet, {{it is necessary to}} control the impact of traffic in the network on voice packet streams. Two approaches have been proposed for this purpose. One is to adapt packet <b>voice</b> <b>applications</b> to the service provided by the network such as the "best effort" service provided by the Internet currently. This approach, however, cannot provide reliable quality-of-service (QOS) guarantee for voice connections [2]. Another is to extend current protocols to provide QOS guarantee based o [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract â€” IEEE 802. 11 {{has become}} de facto {{standard}} for wireless LANs. Although it was originally designed for data communication, emergence of Voice over IP (VoIP) has made it attractive for <b>voice</b> <b>applications.</b> But <b>voice</b> <b>applications</b> require delay guarantee. We have implemented Dynamic Class Selection (DCS) mechanism in Neighborhood Proportional Delay Differentiation (NPDD) (proposed in [1]) architecture to provide delay assurance in IEEE 802. 11 networks. But we found that DCS is not suitable for <b>voice</b> <b>applications</b> which require tight delay bound. Hence, we propose two Adaptive Class Selection (ACS) mechanisms to provide delay assurances to voice flows. However, delay assurance at all nodes within a LAN cannot be provided with ACS or DCS. So we propose Measurement based Distributed Call Admission Control (MDAC) mechanism to provide delay assurances for voice traffic at all nodes. Our experimental results show that ACS and MDAC perform much better than DCS for voice flows at all loads. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} to embedding VoiceXML applications by an off-line compilation scheme. Our primary motivation is that VoiceXML is an established standard for <b>voice</b> <b>applications.</b> However, the complexity and resource requirements of VoiceXML interpretation have so far limited its spread to other application areas than telephony-based services. In many contexts being able to embed <b>voice</b> <b>applications</b> into a larger framework {{is more important than}} the dynamic creation of VoiceXML documents that makes the processing particularly resource demanding. In these contexts, we propose off-line VoiceXML compilation into ECMAScript as a solution for reducing the resource demands. ...|$|R
5000|$|Apple {{has been}} criticized over {{attempting}} to prevent iPhone users from using the Google <b>Voice</b> <b>application</b> by disabling it on the iPhone. Apple declined to approve the Google application for use on the iPhone, claiming that the application altered iPhone intended functionality, i.e., that with Google voice installation, voicemail is no longer routed to the iPhone's native application Visual Voicemail but instead is routed through Google's application, thus [...] "ruining" [...] the iPhone user experience. This caused controversy among iPhone developers and users, and the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began investigating Apple's active decision to deny users' ability to install Google Voice from the Apple online store from where users routinely download and install iPhone applications. As of November 2010, Google Voice has been made available for the iPhone.|$|E
