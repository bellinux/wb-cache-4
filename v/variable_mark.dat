40|$|As noninvasive {{sampling}} {{techniques for}} animal populations {{have become more}} popular, there has been increasing interest {{in the development of}} capture-recapture models that can accommodate both imperfect detection and misidentification of individuals (e. g., due to genotyping error). However, current methods do not allow for individual variation in parameters, such as detection or survival probability. Here we develop misidentification models for capture-recapture data that can simultaneously account for temporal variation, behavioral effects and individual heterogeneity in parameters. To facilitate Bayesian inference using our approach, we extend standard probit regression techniques to latent multinomial models where the dimension and zeros of the response cannot be observed. We also present a novel Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs algorithm for fitting these models using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Using closed population abundance models for illustration, we re-visit a DNA capture-recapture population study of black bears in Michigan, USA and find evidence of misidentification due to genotyping error, as well as temporal, behavioral and individual variation in detection probability. We also estimate a salamander population of known size from laboratory experiments evaluating the effectiveness of a marking technique commonly used for amphibians and fish. Our model was able to reliably estimate the size of this population and provided evidence of individual heterogeneity in misidentification probability that is attributable to <b>variable</b> <b>mark</b> quality. Our approach is more computationally demanding than previously proposed methods, but it provides the flexibility necessary for a much broader suite of models to be explored while properly accounting for uncertainty introduced by misidentification and imperfect detection. In the absence of misidentification, our probit formulation also provides a convenient and efficient Gibbs sampler for Bayesian analysis of traditional closed population capture-recapture data.

40|$|Abstract: Today, cyber-physical systems face {{yet another}} {{challenge}} {{in addition to}} the traditional constraints in energy, computing power, or memory. Shrinking semiconductor structure sizes and supply voltages imply that the number of errors that manifest themselves in a system will rise significantly. Most cyber-physical systems have to survive errors, but many systems do not have sufficient resources to correct all errors that show up. Thus, it is important to spend the available resources on handling errors with the most critical impact. We propose an “unreliability ” annotation for data types in C programs that indicates if an error showing up in a specific variable or data structure will possibly cause a severe problem like a program crash or might only show rather negligible effects, e. g., a discolored pixel in video decoding. This classification of data is supported by static analysis methods that verify if the value contained in a <b>variable</b> <b>marked</b> as unreliable does not end up as part of a critical operation, e. g., an array index or loop termination condition. This classification enables several approaches to flexible error handling. For example, a cyber-physical system designer might choose to selectively safeguard <b>variables</b> <b>marked</b> as reliable or to employ memories with different reliability properties to store the respective values. ...|$|R
30|$|As {{described}} earlier, as {{the number}} of hops between a router in the attack path and the victim increases, the mark information of that specific router is less likely to survive; so {{from the perspective of the}} victim, the farthermost router has the lowest chance to deliver its mark in the attack path.

We estimate a pooled probit econometric model where the probability of failure is expressed as a function of both macroeconomic variables (inflation, interest rates etc) and company financial ratios. The inclusion of macroeconomic <b>variables</b> <b>marks</b> a departure from most previous studies of company bankruptcy. We find that the most important determinants of bankruptcy of the UK real estate companies are company liquidity, profitability and debt coverage as well as financial market volatility, interest rates, current account and the economic cycle.

40|$|AbstractThrough {{employing}} [14 C]-PER exposure experiments it {{was shown}} {{for the first time}} that PER taken up by drought-stressed spruce needles via the air/needle pathway is preferably degraded to trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in the chloroplasts. TCA formed by oxidative biotransformation is mineralised to CO 2 and HCl via various degradation routes. HCl contributes to increased proton concentration in the chloroplast, inducing a pH shift leading to a pathophysiological effect on H+ transport from the thylakoid interior into the stroma. As a result of their high degree of dissociation and related protonation, the PER metabolites, TCA and HCl, cause a change in protein structures. In addition to this, the TCA anions created in the process may lead to destabilisation of the thylakoid membrane potential. The damage to the chloroplasts inflicted by protons and trichloroacetate ions subsequently leads to an impairment of photosynthesis, most particularly to uncoupling of photosynthetic electron transport. Since progressive aridity as consequence of the climate change observed throughout the world is predicted, a regionally <b>variable</b> <b>marked</b> enhancement of the phytotoxic risk caused by PER emission is anticipated...|$|R

This paper presents results from a pilot core from the Chew Bahir basin in southern Ethiopia that records the climatic history of the past 45 ka, with emphasis on the African Humid Period (AHP, ? 15 ? 5 ka calBP). Geochemical, physical and biological indicators show that Chew Bahir responded to climatic fluctuations on millennial to centennial timescales, and to the precessional cycle, since the Last Glacial Maximum. Potassium content of the sediment {{appears to be a}} reliable proxy for aridity, showing that Chew Bahir reacted to the insolation-controlled humidity increase of the AHP with a remarkably abrupt onset and a gradual termination, framing a sharply defined arid phase (? 12. 8 ? 11. 6 ka calBP) corresponding to the Younger Dryas chronozone. The Chew Bahir record correlates well with low- and high-latitude paleoclimate records, demonstrating that the site responded to regional and global climate changes. Peer reviewe...|$|R
