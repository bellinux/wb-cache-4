The poems of Kaliththogai are in Kali metre which {{is known for its}} {{dramatic}} and lyrical qualities and which, according to Tolkappiyam is well suited to express the emotions of the lovers. There is repetition of certain lines and phrases and this, added to the haunting music of the metre, is <b>very</b> <b>appealing.</b>|$|E
25|$|The local habitat {{was rich}} in {{mammalian}} resources, allowing the Altai Neanderthals to permanently {{settle in the}} foothills of the Altai Mountains by at least 300,000 years ago. The Altai Neanderthals appeared to have chosen occupational sites primarily based on their strategic locations close to rivers and within valleys, locations ideal for hunting prey. During the early to middle Late Pleistocene, the broader region in general was most likely composed of forest and forest tundra, based on a mix of conifer and some broad-leaved trees. Under these conditions, the Altai-Sayan region provided the early hominin inhabitants with a <b>very</b> <b>appealing</b> environment.|$|E

25|$|Interactionism is {{the view}} that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally {{interact}} with physical states. This is a position which is <b>very</b> <b>appealing</b> to common-sense intuitions, notwithstanding {{the fact that it}} is very difficult to establish its validity or correctness by way of logical argumentation or empirical proof. It seems to appeal to common-sense because we are surrounded by such everyday occurrences as a child's touching a hot stove (physical event) which causes him to feel pain (mental event) and then yell and scream (physical event) which causes his parents to experience a sensation of fear and protectiveness (mental event) and so on.|$|E
25|$|It is {{probable}} that Pisanello's portrait medals were cast {{with the intention of}} reviving the form of ancient coins. Pisanello’s medal of John can be firmly located within a period when the court at Ferrara was witnessing an escalation in the appreciation of classical learning. Niccolò III d’Este was the first lord of Ferrara to be educated by a Renaissance humanist and in 1429 he invited the humanist scholar, Guarino da Verona, to tutor his son Leonello. Leonello cultivated a strong admiration for writers like Cicero. During his reign in the 1440s he resolved to revitalise the Studium of Ferrara by recruiting more humanist scholars to work there. Part of this appreciation gave rise to the study of ancient coins: these were the most enduring and abundant artefacts available from antiquity and Leonello himself was an enthusiastic numismatist. Pisanello’s own personal interest in Roman coins is vividly apparent from his drawings of them, and his successful development of the portrait medal as a medium of sculpture can be explained in part to its similarity to coins. The medal evoked a powerful link to antiquity which made it <b>very</b> <b>appealing</b> to patrons.|$|E

500|$|Inspired by the film, baroque {{pop singer}} Lana Del Rey {{recorded}} a cover version of Bobby Vinton's classic {{rendition of the}} song [...] "Blue Velvet" [...] in 2012. Used to endorse clothing line H, a music video accompanied the track and aired as a television commercial. Filmed in Post-war Americana, the video drew influence from Lynch and Blue Velvet. In the video, Del Rey {{plays the role of}} Dorothy Vallens, performing a private concert similar to the scene where Ben (Dean Stockwell) pantomimes [...] "In Dreams" [...] for Frank Booth. Del Rey's version, however, has her lip-syncing [...] "Blue Velvet" [...] when a little person dressed as Frank Sinatra approaches and unplugs a hidden Victrola, revealing Del Rey as a fraud.

25|$|In 1949, TVR {{built its}} first {{original}} chassis. The Hotchkis-style rear suspension used the live axle from a Morris Eight, {{and the front}} suspension was of an independent trailing-arm design. The engine was a Ford 1172cc sidevalve from a 1936 van, tuned to 35hp. Even before the car was bodied, it was crashed by the man hired to create the bodywork, Les Dale. After repairs, the body was styled and built from aluminium, and painted British racing green. Although neither Wilkinson nor Pickard found the finished bodywork to be <b>very</b> aesthetically <b>appealing,</b> it was functional, {{and the two men}} conducted the first successful test drive on the runway at Squires Gate aerodrome in 1949.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we prove {{that for a}} class of RLC {{circuits}} with convex energy function and weak electromagnetic coupling {{it is possible to}} “add a differentiation” to the port terminals preserving passivity—with a new storage function that {{is directly related to the}} circuit power. The result is of interest in circuits theory, but also has applications in control problems as it suggests the paradigm of power shaping stabilization as an alternative to the well–known method of energy shaping. We show in the paper that, in contrast with energy shaping designs, power shaping is not restricted to systems without pervasive dissipation and naturally allows to add “derivative” actions in the control. These important features, that stymie the applicability of energy shaping control, make power shaping <b>very</b> practically <b>appealing,</b> as illustrated with examples in the paper. ...|$|R

Kim's appearance evolved dramatically {{over the course of}} three months. The character was originally designed to look like [...] "a pretty standard-looking athletic blonde", which was gradually changed in favor of a more distinctive appearance. At one point, Kim's design was based on that of video game character Lara Croft from Tomb Raider. However, the Disney Channel eventually determined that Lara [...] "is ... not a very real character." [...] Finally, the creators decided to give Kim a more realistic appearance akin to that of a 14-year-old girl as opposed to a bombshell, concluding, [...] "She has a nice, <b>very</b> <b>appealing</b> design, but we just wanted to keep it out of that realm of video game heroine." [...] The creators admitted that Kim would have been their [...] "dream girl" [...] in high school, joking, [...] "She would have been way out of our class though." [...] Director Chris Baily wanted Kim to be designed with [...] "graphic sensibilities" [...] {{similar to those of the}} show's backgrounds, creating a 3D character [...] "whose feet can be planted on the ground and communicate a sense of space." [...] For example, when the character is dressed in all-black, Kim was drawn without a white outline so that she virtually disappears when she moves in front of a black background, yet her [...] "simple design" [...] and flesh allows audiences to [...] "fill in where her body is" [...] naturally. The show's female characters are the only characters drawn with lips, only the upper of which is visible. Describing Kim as [...] "a mostly graphic heroine", Animation: A World History: Volume III: Contemporary Times author Giannalberto Bendazzi agreed that the character's [...] "limited animation" [...] was intentional. In the fourth season, the character's signature crop top and cargo pants are replaced by a T-shirt and pants because the former outfit was damaged during a fight with Shego. Some viewers noted that Kim's face appeared to be [...] "rounder" [...] than it had been drawn in previous seasons. Kim was animated by Rough Draft Korea.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} {{several new}} algorithms for Byzantine agreement. The {{first of these}} is a simplification of the original exponential-time Byzantine agreement algorithm due to Pease, Shostak, and Lamport, and is of comparable complexity to their algorithm. However, its proof is <b>very</b> intuitively <b>appealing.</b> A technique of shifting between algorithms for solving the Byzantine agreement problem is then studied. We present two families of algorithms obtained by applying a shift operator to our first algorithm. These families obtain the same rounds to message length trade-off as do Coan's families but do not require the exponential local computation time (and space) of his algorithms. We also describe a modification of an O(n) -resilient algorithm for Byzantine agreement of Dolev, Reischuk, and Strong. Finally, we obtain a hybrid algorithm that dominates all our others, by beginning execution of an algorithm in one family, first shifting into an algorithm of the second family, and finally shifting into an execution of the adaptation of the Dolev, Reischuk, and Strong algorithm...|$|R

Convexity of the purchasing/selling cost implies that the more the firm purchases from or sells to the outside market, the more expensive or less valuable the raw material becomes. For all cases, we find the partial characterizations for the optimal policies, which all {{turn out to be}} <b>very</b> intuitively <b>appealing.</b> In particular, for each of the linear-cost cases, the optimal policy degenerates into a combination of two base-stock policies: one for the raw material inventory and the other for the finished product inventory.

2500|$|Timbaland, {{a popular}} {{contemporary}} R producer in America, {{was the major}} innovator behind contemporary R at the time, from which UK rave culture borrowed heavily. The use of rhythmic patterns as melodic hooks is shared by both contemporary R and jungle, making it <b>very</b> <b>appealing</b> to the significantly ex-junglist UK garage scene. This style of Timbaland's R possesses a breakbeat aesthetic: breakup {{of the flow of}} four-to-the-floor rhythm; hesitations into the groove; and teasing and tantalizing gaps. As much as these R influences can be heard in early UK garage; the genre offered more complex drum beats, with heavy synchopation (swing) and a more energetic feel due to a higher tempo (normally between 130 and 138 BPM). However, in tracks like [...] "Twentyfourseven" [...] by Artful Dodger, a slower and simpler R infused drum pattern can be heard. This was to allow for these tracks to be aimed at a more commercial scene rather than for the dancefloor. Garage producers then proceeded to churn out UK versions of US contemporary R hits, notably with Brandy and Monica's [...] "The Boy Is Mine". The Architechs sped up the vocals through time-stretching and added sound effects to increase the competitive nature. [...] "B Remix" [...] eventually sold twenty thousand copies as a bootleg.|$|E
2500|$|In the 21st century, though {{women still}} face some degrees of {{discrimination}} in the Japanese job market, {{there have been a}} number of companies that both foster women's equality and reward them on a talent based system. [...] New fields, such as banking, journalism, insurance sales, and advertising; companies in the information industry, are <b>very</b> <b>appealing</b> to women, because they reward them based on individual ability. [...] These companies are also keen to rotate workers out every two or three years, giving women the opportunity to explore a number of different departments without job hopping, fostering trust in the company and versatility in the women workers.

40|$|Abstract. The k-nearest {{neighbour}} (k-NN) technique, {{due to its}} interpretable nature, is {{a simple}} and <b>very</b> intuitively <b>appealing</b> method to address classification problems. However, choosing an appropriate distance function for k-NN can be challenging and an inferior choice can make the classifier highly vulnerable to noise in the data. In this paper, we propose a new method for determining a good distance function for k-NN. Our method is based on consideration of the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve, which is a well known method to measure the quality of binary classifiers. It computes weights for the distance function, based on ROC properties within an appropriate neighbourhood for the instances whose distance is being computed. We experimentally compare the effect of our scheme {{with a number of}} other well-known k-NN distance metrics, as well as with a range of different classifiers. Experiments show that our method can substantially boost the classification performance of the k-NN algorithm. Furthermore, in a number of cases our technique is even able to deliver better accuracy than state-of-the-art non k-NN classifiers, such as support vector machines...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{efficient}} general-purpose objective no-reference (NR) image quality assessment (IQA) framework based on unsupervised feature learning. The {{goal is to}} build a computational model to automatically predict human perceived image quality without a reference image and without knowing the distortion present in the image. Previous approaches for this problem typically rely on hand-crafted features which are carefully designed based on prior knowledge. In contrast, we use raw-image-patches extracted from a set of unlabeled images to learn a dictionary in an unsupervised manner. We use soft-assignment coding with max pooling to obtain effective image representations for quality estimation. The proposed algorithm is <b>very</b> computationally <b>appealing,</b> using raw image patches as local descriptors and using soft-assignment for encoding. Furthermore, unlike previous methods, our unsupervised feature learning strategy enables our method to adapt to different domains. CORNIA (Codebook Representation for No-Reference Image Assessment) is tested on LIVE database and shown to perform statistically better than the full-reference quality measure, structural similarity index (SSIM) and is shown to be comparable to state-of-the-art general purpose NR-IQA algorithms. 1...|$|R
