5|$|The Storm Prediction Center also is {{responsible}} for issuing fire weather outlooks (FWD) for the continental United States. These outlooks are a guidance product for local, state and federal government agencies, including local National Weather Service offices, in forecasting the potential for wildfires. The outlooks issued are for Day 1, Day 2, and Days 3–8. The Day 1 product is issued at 4:00 a.m. Central Time and is updated at 1700Z, and is <b>valid</b> <b>from</b> 1200Z to 1200Z the following day. The Day 2 outlook is issued at 1000Z and is updated at 2000Z for the forecast period of 1200Z to 1200Z the following day. The Day 3–8 outlook is issued at 2200Z, and is <b>valid</b> <b>from</b> 1200Z {{two days after the}} current calendar date to 1200Z seven days after the current calendar date.|$|E

Day 2 moderate risks are fairly uncommon, and a Day 2 high risk has only been issued twice (for April 7, 2006 and for April 14, 2012).|$|E

5|$|After {{the airport}} opened, {{services}} started with Widerøe-operated twenty-seat de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters. The airline operated two trips Bodø–Røst–Værøy–Bodø on weekdays and one round trip during the weekend. In addition, {{there were two}} weekly trips that connected Værøy to Leknes Airport before returning to Bodø. The service was subsidized by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Widerøe replaced the Twin Otters with 37-seat de Havilland Canada DHC-8-100 Dash 8s in 1995. The route from Bodø to Røst was made subject to public service obligation from 1 April 1997, which was won by the incumbent, after beating Valdresfly and Helikopter Service in the auction. The following contract, <b>valid</b> <b>from</b> 1 April 2000, was awarded to Guard Air, but this company folded in 2001. Helikopter Service operated the route temporarily until Widerøe took it over again the same year.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{unsuccessful}} ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336BC, the orator Ctesiphon {{proposed that}} Athens honour Demosthenes {{for his services}} to the city by presenting him, according to custom, with a golden crown. This proposal became a political issue and, in 330BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant speech, On the Crown, Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and vehemently attacked those who would have preferred peace with Macedon. He was unrepentant about his past actions and policies and insisted that, when in power, the constant aim of his policies was the honour and the ascendancy of his country; and on every occasion and in all business he preserved his loyalty to Athens. He finally defeated Aeschines, although his enemy's objections to the crowning were arguably <b>valid</b> <b>from</b> a legal point of view.|$|E

The airline kept the contract for nine years. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. Following a competition with Ålesund to receive a new search and rescue base, the government selected Florø as the sixth detachment of the Royal Norwegian Air Force's 330 Squadron. The base became operational in September 2009 after investments of 70 million Norwegian krone. The following year GDF Suez started operations on its Gjøa Oil Field and CHC Helikopter Service expanded its base.|$|E

Bikes can be used for up to three hours per loan and can be rented from Monday to Sunday from 6 am to 10 pm.|$|E
25|$|The final {{agreement}} was signed on 8 February 1951 {{at the same}} location as the former, in the head office of the Norwegian Shipowners' Association in Oslo. It was made retroactively <b>valid</b> <b>from</b> 1 October 1950, giving OSAS a profit of SEK4.2 {{million in the first}} three quarters of 1950. OSAS had then made 2641 flights across the North Atlantic, 657 across the South Atlantic and 64 to the Far East, transporting 130,000 without accidents. From OSAS, 1,076 were transferred, along with 5,554 people from the national airlines and ESAS. The company had a capital of SEK157 million (DDK210 million or NOK217 million), 59 aircraft and 6630 employees. Norlin was appointed CEO, deputized by Backe and Rasmussen.|$|E
25|$|In {{the tender}} <b>valid</b> <b>from</b> 1 April 2012 the routes to Svolvær, Leknes, Røst and Narvik were awarded to Danish Air Transport. Two weeks before {{operations}} were {{to start the}} Civil Aviation Authority of Norway stated that DAT {{did not meet the}} safety requirements, resulting in Widerøe instead being awarded the contract. The main issue resolved around the installation of the SCAT-I landing system; the time from the tender was completed until the operations started was eight weeks, but it took eight months to install the system. DAT stated that the introduction of the SCAT-I-system had resulted in a de facto monopoly for Widerøe. DAT sued the ministry for breaching the tender rules, but lost the case.|$|E

25|$|The {{demand for}} air travel dropped in 2001, and only 85,000 {{passengers}} flew with Coast Air to Florø, {{instead of the}} estimated 100,000, making the entire operation a loss for the company. Despite this, Coast Air leased a third ATR 42 aircraft in February 2002. But cancellations continued to rise, and in November the company's subsidies from the ministry were reduced {{due to lack of}} performance. In December 2001, Guard Air was forced to terminate all operations, and a new PSO tender was made for the services to Fagernes. Along with Arctic Air, Widerøe and DAT, Coast Air made a bid. The contract was won by Arctic Air. With the next round of PSO contracts, <b>valid</b> <b>from</b> 1 April 2003 through 31 March 2006, Coast Air lost the Florø contract to DAT, but succeeded at winning the contract for Fagernes for NOK10 million per year.|$|E
25|$|Lufttransport won {{the tender}} <b>valid</b> <b>from</b> 1 August 2005, winning ahead of CHC with a bid of NOK56 million. Lufttransport renewed the {{contract}} {{for a new}} three years starting 1 August 2008, after {{they were the only}} bidder in the tender. They received NOK102 million for three years. During this period better navigational aids were installed, allowing helicopters to operate during twice per day also during the dark period of the year. Lufttransport was the only bidder for the following contract, which lasts three years from 1 August 2011. The subsidies for this period are NOK96 million. Because it only serves helicopters, Værøy does not have an aerodrome flight information service (AFIS). As part of the Single European Sky ATM Research program, Avinor installed a remote AFIS service at Værøy, which is controlled from Bodø. If successful, the program may result in regional airports in Norway receiving remote AFIS services.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, the Hong Kong Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) awarded Lloyd International Airways (Hong Kong) Freighters, an {{associate}} company of Lloyd International, a licence to operate twice-weekly all-cargo services between Hong Kong and London.

Nineteen sixty-six was also the year Neckermann und Reisen, the tour operator of West German mail-order concern Neckermann, contracted Lloyd International to launch a series of weekday IT flights from Tegel Airport {{in what used to}} be West Berlin's French sector in the days prior to Germany's reunification. These flights were operated with Britannias. They served principal European holiday resorts in the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. The combination of these flights with a similar series of weekend IT flights from Scotland on behalf of a British tour operator fully utilised one Britannia for that summer season.|$|E

The stamps were designs of Queen Victoria like most British colonies, but also used the Maltese cross as a heraldic device. British stamps were no longer <b>valid</b> <b>from</b> this date except for mail from British military zones, where British stamps were used until 1979. A large format 5-shilling value complemented the set in 1886 and this was used until 1911. Also in 1886, the GPO moved to Palazzo Parisio in Merchants Street, Valletta. Police stations in several villages began to sell stamps around 1891. Bollo personale, or postmen's personal handstamps, were used to indicate which postman delivered a particular letter. The earliest recorded use is 16 August 1888 while the latest is 29 September 1949.|$|E
