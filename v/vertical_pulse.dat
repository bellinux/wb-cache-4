We present exact Riemann wave solutions of the optical shallow water equations and show that they agree remarkably well with the numerical solutions of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, at least {{up to the point}} where a <b>vertical</b> <b>pulse</b> front develops.

This paper focuses on the uses of mobile devices such as PDA’s and smart phones without {{additional}} hardware to direct pedestrians based on synthetic texturing along with 3 D modeling. Each facade is reconstructed by arraying small sized textures in respect to their geometries in different layers. In the process of texture generation cropping, rectifying, removing disturbing objects and exposure setting should be done in advance.

40|$|Following {{pioneering}} {{efforts in}} East Antarctica, we herein {{report on the}} amplitude and temporal characteristics of polarized surface radar echo data collected in South Polar ice using radio sounding equipment with 0. 5 -ns echo-time precision. We observe strong echoes at 6, 9. 6, 13. 9, 17, and 19 μs following <b>vertical</b> <b>pulse</b> emission from the surface, in {{the upper half of}} the ice sheet. The synchronicity of those echoes for all broadcast azimuthal polarizations affirms the lack of observable birefringence over the upper half of the ice sheet, in contrast to East Antarctica measurements in the vicinity of Dome Fuji, and signifies a dramatic difference in the character of the ice sheet in the intervening 1400 km. Of the five strongest echoes, three exhibit an evident correlation with the local surface ice flow direction, qualitatively consistent with measurements in East Antarctica. Our radio sounding measurements also permit the most precise determination to date of the ice thickness at South Pole...|$|E

We observe strong echoes at 6, 9. 6, 13. 9, 17, and 19 μs following <b>vertical</b> <b>pulse</b> emission from the surface, corresponding to reflectors in {{the upper half of}} the ice sheet. The synchronicity of those echoes for all broadcast azimuthal polarizations affirms the lack of observable birefringence over the upper half of the ice sheet. Of the five strongest echoes, three exhibit an evident amplitude correlation with the local surface ice flow direction, qualitatively consistent with measurements in East Antarctica. Combined with other radio echo sounding data, we conclude that observed birefringent asymmetries at South Pole are generated entirely in {{the lower half of the}} ice sheet. By contrast, birefringent asymmetries are observed at shallow depths in East Antarctica...|$|E

40|$|Five {{comparable}} airborne lidar datasets {{were collected}} over a mixed wood site on five separate occasions throughout a single growing season to capture changing canopy transmittance conditions. Using the small footprint discrete pulse intensity return data, the <b>vertical</b> <b>pulse</b> power distribution was reconstructed for 30 plots each containing 5 digital hemispherical photo (DHP) stations. Canopy gap fraction {{was calculated for}} the 150 DHP images collected coincident with the lidar data and used as validation for overhead canopy transmittance. By modifying a Beer-Lambert approach, we relate the ratio of lidar intensity-based ground return power / total return power to the canopy gap fraction. The results are compared to the commonly cited and utilised ground-to-total returns ratio. It is found that for the mixed wood environment studied, a lidar intensity-based power distribution ratio provides a slightly higher coefficient of determination with DHP gap fraction (r 2 = 0. 92) than does the often used ground-to-total return ratio approach (r 2 = 0. 86). Moreover, if the intensity power distribution ratio is modified to account for two-way pulse transmission losses within the canopy, the model requires no calibration and provides a 1 : 1 estimate of the overhead (solar zenith) gap fraction...|$|E
40|$|The {{compiled}} model integrates three partial processes: (i) Infiltration {{of rainfall}} {{water into the}} soil and overland flow resulting from rainfall, (ii) detachment of soil particles by overland flow and by the impact of water droplets, (iii) hydraulic transportation of the particles in the surface-parallel flow. Each of these processes is described in differential, homogeneous segments of time and place. Segment combination results in overall process description. For detachment quantification {{the impact of the}} rainfall is compared with the critical erosion resistance. Transport capacity is deduced from the comparison between the <b>vertical</b> <b>pulse</b> component of the overland flow and the critical pulse flow of soil particles. Infiltration is independently described using the model conception by Green and Ampt. Soil erosion is calculated on the basis of individual rainfall or erosion events, several events can be knotted to give the monthly or yearly erosion situation. Model validation has been carried out by reasonableness tests, comparison with experimental data and sensitivity analyses. Advantages include a menu-controlled handling and a comparative small amount of required input data.

40|$|Performance {{data are}} {{presented}} for a flight-like, lightweight, high efficiency pulse tube cryogenic cooler. The cooler has {{a mass of}} less than 4. 0 kg, and an efficiency of 12 W/W, which is 18 % of Carnot at 95 K, nearly double the efficiency of previous cooler designs, The mass of the cooler has been reduced by approximately a factor of three. The design point cooling power is 10 watts at 95 K at a heat rejection temperature of 300 K. The no-load temperature is 45 K. The compressor is built by Hymatic Engineering, UK, and is of a horizontally opposed piston design using flexure bearings. The <b>vertical</b> <b>pulse</b> tube is built by TRW with the heat exchanger or cold block located approximately mid-way along the tube. The final assembly and integration is also performed by TRW. The inertance tube and dead volume are contained within one of the compressor end caps. The cooler was developed by TRW under a joint NASA-DOD program, and has a goal of 10 yr operating lifetime. Potential NASA applications will focus on using coolers of this type in Zero boil off (ZBO) cryogen storage topologies for next generation launch vehicles. Zero boil off systems will feature significant reductions in tank size and Initial Mass to Low Earth Orbit (IMLEO), thereby significantly reducing the cost of access to space, and enabling future missions. The coolers can be used directly in liquid oxygen (LOx) or liquid methane ZBO systems, as shield coolers in liquid hydrogen tanks, or as first stage coolers in two-stage liquid hydrogen (LH 2) ZBO cooler systems. Finally, the coolers could find applications in exploration missions where either propellants or breathable oxygen are extracted from the planetary atmosphere using a Sabatier or similar process. The gases could then be liquefied for storage either directly in return vehicle propellant tanks or on the planetary surface. Data presented were taken with the cooler operating in a vacuum of 10 (exp - 5) torr, at controlled rejection temperatures from 300 K down to 275 K using a cold water heat exchanger bolted to the cooler. Heat loads were varied between 0. 5 W and 15 W by supplying current to a 50 omega resistor mounted on a copper cold plate which was bolted to the cooler cold block. Silicon diodes mounted on both the cold plate and the heat exchanger provided accurate temperature measurement to within plus or minus 0. 25 K and plus or minus 0. 5 K respectively, up to 100 K with plus or minus 1 % accuracy above 100 K. Input power to the compressor was limited to 180 W, corresponding to a maximum stroke of 80 %...|$|E

5000|$|Differential Phase (θdp) - The {{differential}} phase is {{a comparison of}} the returned phase difference between the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>pulses.</b> This change in phase is caused by the difference in the number of wave cycles (or wavelengths) along the propagation path for horizontal and vertically polarized waves. It {{should not be confused with}} the Doppler frequency shift, which is caused by the motion of the cloud and precipitation particles. Unlike the differential reflectivity, correlation coefficient and linear depolarization ratio, which are all dependent on reflected power, the {{differential phase}} is a [...] "propagation effect." [...] It is a very good estimator of rain rate and is not affected by attenuation. The range derivative of differential phase (specific differential phase, Kdp) can be used to localize areas of strong precipitation/attenuation.|$|R

50|$|DAC {{word length}}s range usually from 6 to 10 bits. The SRAM's word length {{is three times}} the DAC's word length. The SRAM acts as a color lookup table (CLUT). It usually has 256 entries (and thus an 8-bit address). If the DAC's word length is also 8 bits, we have a 256 x 24-bit SRAM which allows a {{selection}} of 256 out of 16777216 (16,7 million) possible colors for the display. The contents of this SRAM can be altered when no pixel needs to be generated for transmission to the display. A synchronization pulse is required to maintain vertical picture stability. Therefore, a <b>vertical</b> blanking <b>pulse</b> is generated for every frame. This <b>vertical</b> blanking <b>pulse</b> is not visible on the display, nor is any pixel sent. Therefore, the D/A is idle and can allow the user to modify the SRAM color lookup table.|$|R
50|$|Separate sync is {{most common}} with VGA, used {{worldwide}} for analog computer monitors. This is sometimes known as RGBHV, as the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> synchronization <b>pulses</b> are sent in separate channels. This mode requires five conductors.

50|$|In video {{production}} and computer graphics, {{changes to the}} image are often kept {{in step with the}} <b>vertical</b> synchronization <b>pulse</b> to avoid visible discontinuity of the image. Since the frame buffer of a computer graphics display imitates the dynamics of a cathode-ray display, if it is updated with a new image while the image is being transmitted to the display, the display shows a mishmash of both frames, producing a page tearing artifact partway down the image.|$|R
5000|$|Analog video formats convey video signals as {{a series}} of [...] "lines". Most of these lines are used for {{constructing}} the visible image, and are shown on the screen.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{collaboration}} between the University of Leeds, Sellafield Ltd and MMI Engineering Ltd, bespoke acoustic instrumentation and numerical simulation methods have been established to optimize nuclear legacy waste transfers. Specifically, a new ultrasonic measurement system has been developed, allowing suspended particle concentration and consolidation to be measured remotely. This technology has been combined with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling of settling particulate systems, permitting full characterization, simulation and prediction of sludge separation processes. Presented here are experimental and numerical results on the transport and settling behavior of non-active nuclear-analogue suspensions in two flow geometries: gravitational settling of glass dispersions in a 250 -liter column; and transport and sedimentation of flocculated calcite in a close-to-full-scale clarifier (9 m 3 total volume and 4. 8 m 2 length). In addition, details of the design, construction and calibration of a custom-built Ultrasonic Array Research Platform (UARP) are described. Settling column results suggested that particle concentration changes could be simulated with good accuracy by a CFD model (developed using the open source OpenFOAM framework) when compared to measured samples. Large-scale clarifier trials {{were used to assess}} the effectiveness of the UARP controller with an attached in situ acoustic backscatter array (ABA). The ABA consisted of 8 transducers angled down at 20 o to the <b>vertical,</b> <b>pulsing</b> at 2 - 2. 5 MHz in cycles (covering 1. 8 m total depth). In comparison to a range of sampled concentrations across the length of the clarifier, results confirmed that the UARP-ABA system was highly successful at characterizing these complex flows over several hours of operation, allowing visualization of depth-wise bulk density changes and bed build-up over time. Collectively, this work highlights the capability of these tools to monitor and optimize a number of current waste transfer operations at Sellafield, with further potential applications for solid-liquid separations across waste, water treatment and minerals engineering industries...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect on}} the functioning of the vestibular system of a rupture of Reissner’s membrane, artificial endolymph was injected in scala media of ten guinea pigs and vestibular evoked potentials (VsEPs), evoked by <b>vertical</b> acceleration <b>pulses,</b> were measured. Directly after injection of a sufficient volume to cause rupture, all ears showed a complete disappearance of VsEP, followed by partial recovery. To {{investigate the}} effect of perilymphatic potassium concentration on the vestibular sensory and neural structures, different concentrations of KCl were injected directly into the vestibule. The KCl injections resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of VsEP, followed by a dose-dependent slow recovery. This animal model clearly shows a disturbing effect of a higher than normal K+ concentration in perilymph on the vestibular and neural structures in the inner ear.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} an acute endolymphatic hydrops on {{the functioning of the}} vestibular system a hydrops was created by microinjection of artificial endolymph through the basilar membrane into scala media in 10 guinea pigs. To control for the effect of perforation of the basilar membrane, the same procedure was performed in 9 other guinea pigs, but without injection of endolymph. Contralateral ears served as control ears. Vestibular evoked potentials, evoked by <b>vertical</b> acceleration <b>pulses</b> applied to the guinea pig's head, were measured in all ears before, immediately after, and 2, 4, and 5 hours after perforation/injection. Acute endolymphatic hydrops did not affect the amplitude of the VsEP immediately after injection. After 4 to 5 hours VsEP was significantly reduced in both hydrops and perforated-only ears, compared to control ears. However, no significant difference was found between VsEP of the hydrops ears and perforated-only ears. Reduction of VsEP is not caused by a direct hydromechanical effect on the vestibular system, but possibly by leakage of perilymph through the perforation hole, supporting the membrane rupture theory for Meniere-attacks...|$|R
