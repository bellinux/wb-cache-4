40|$|Running gait {{has been}} shown to alter due to changes in intensity. It was {{hypothesised}} that a sacral mounted single inertial sensor could identify the centre of mass (COM) <b>vertical</b> <b>accelerations.</b> This study aimed to validate this new technique against a criterion measure and to determine the influence of changes in running intensity on COM <b>vertical</b> <b>acceleration</b> and the symmetry of COM <b>vertical</b> <b>acceleration</b> between left and right steps. Ten athletes ran for 5 min at their self-selected pace, plus 1 km/h above and below this velocity. Validity of the single inertial sensor was determined by comparing COM <b>vertical</b> <b>acceleration</b> against that measured with a six-camera infrared system. Large correlation (r = 0. 96), a small typical error of estimate (1. 84), and mean bias (0. 02) were found between the two systems. The greatest magnitude in COM <b>vertical</b> <b>acceleration</b> occurred at the slowest running pace and decreased as pace increased. Sixty percent of the athletes exhibited asymmetry during at least one running pace; 30 % were asymmetrical across all three velocities. While significant changes in COM <b>vertical</b> <b>acceleration</b> occurred between the different running velocities, this did not always result in a change in symmetry. This study found that a single inertial sensor {{can be used as a}} valid means of measuring COM <b>vertical</b> <b>acceleration.</b> This technique can detect changes in the COM <b>vertical</b> <b>acceleration</b> that may change with running velocity.

However, research conducted in recent years showed that it is also important to include the <b>vertical</b> component of <b>acceleration</b> when designing base isolated structures. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to investigate the effect that the <b>vertical</b> component of <b>acceleration</b> has on base isolated structures by investigating the impact of <b>vertical</b> <b>acceleration</b> on the isolator stiffness, structural response and isolator displacement. A time history analysis showed that <b>vertical</b> <b>acceleration</b> has a limited effect on the isolator stiffness.

This paper presents the stability analysis of seawall under the combined action of earthquake forces, non-breaking wave force, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces and uplift force. Stability of seawall is assessed in terms of its factor of safety against landward sliding and landward overturning modes of failures. Seismic passive earth resistance has been calculated using pseudo-static approach. A detailed parametric study has been conducted to study the effect of non-breaking wave height, depth of water on seaward and land ward sides, soil and wall friction angles, and horizontal and <b>vertical</b> seismic <b>accelerations.</b> The <b>factor</b> of safety against overturning mode of failure decreases by about 52 %, for a change in the ratio of non-breaking wave height to the depth of water on seaward side from 0 to 0. 60. Present study shows that the seismic stability of seawall is more sensitive to non-breaking wave height, soil friction angle, wall friction angle and horizontal seismic acceleration. Proposed closed form solutions and design charts can be used for the seismic design of seawall for passive case under the combined action of earthquake and non-breaking wave forces.

40|$|Since {{high-speed}} railway bridges {{are subjected}} to cyclic loading by the continuous wheel loads traveling at high speed and regular spacing, their dynamic behavior is of extreme importance and has significant influence on the riding safety of the trains. To secure the riding safety of the trains, advanced railway countries have limited the <b>vertical</b> <b>acceleration</b> of the bridge slab below critical values at specific frequency domains. Since these limitations of the <b>vertical</b> <b>acceleration</b> constitute {{the most important factors}} in securing the dynamic safety of the bridges, these countries have opted for a conservative approach. However, the Korean specifications limit only the size of the peak acceleration without considering the frequency domain, which impede significantly rational evaluation of the high-speed railway bridges in Korea.

The Equine Lameness Locator ® (ELL) is a newly developed system {{that provides a}} robust and objective method to detect and evaluate equine lameness. To achieve objective lameness evaluation, the system analyzes a horse’s head and pelvis vertical movement signals during trotting. Two uniaxial accelerometers are placed on the horse’s torso, one each on the horse’s head and pelvis to record <b>vertical</b> <b>accelerations.</b> <b>Vertical</b> position signals are obtained by numerical double integration of the acceleration signals. However, these integrated position signals contain very large moving averages and require advance methods of signal processing for correction. In this thesis, {{a combination of the}} Hilbert Huang transform and a conjugate-pair decomposition method is proposed and tested against the current ELL’s signal processing method, a sliding-window curve-fitting method. Numerical simulations and experimental results show that the proposed new method involves more intense computation but does not provide better results for lameness evaluation of horses. Hence, the original sliding-window curve-fitting method is recommended for future use. Clinical and experimental observations reveal that a horse’s head and pelvis also rotate during trotting. These rotations may cause inaccurate measurements of the true <b>vertical</b> <b>accelerations.</b> Hence, this work also numerically and experimentally examines the influences of rotations on the measured <b>vertical</b> <b>accelerations.</b> Numerical techniques, unique experimental devices and setups, and an algorithm for correcting accelerometer outputs to obtain true <b>vertical</b> <b>accelerations</b> have been developed and experimentally validated...|$|R

For various patrol, search and rescue or {{military}} operations attaining high forward speeds is essential. In head and bow quartering seas, the main factor for voluntary speed reduction is the occurrence of large <b>vertical</b> peak <b>accelerations.</b> The occurrence of large <b>vertical</b> peak <b>accelerations</b> imposes limits to the operability of planing monohulls sailing in head seas. A challenge for designers of fast monohulls is to explore different possibilities to increase the operability of planing monohulls sailing in head seas. To achieve this a reduction of the <b>vertical</b> <b>accelerations</b> is required. The operability can be considered improved if the level of accelerations can be reduced compared to a trip at an equal but constant forward speed. This implies {{that it is possible}} to sail at a higher speed without increasing the discomfort on board. A solution for increasing the operability of planing monohulls sailing in head seas has been found in proactive control. <b>Vertical</b> peak <b>accelerations</b> have a very short duration. Unacceptably large <b>vertical</b> peak <b>accelerations</b> have a low frequency of occurrence. These two aspects are the incentive for a proactive control system.
