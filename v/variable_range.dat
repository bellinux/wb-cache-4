25|$|The {{diversity}} of the crystal structures of rare-earth borides results in interesting physical properties and potential applications in thermopower generation. Thermal conductivity of boron icosahedra based compounds is low because of their complex crystal structure; this property is favored for thermoelectric materials. On the other hand, these compounds exhibit very low (<b>variable</b> <b>range</b> hopping type) p-type electrical conductivity. Increasing the conductivity is a key issue for thermoelectric applications of these borides.|$|E
25|$|Explicit {{numerical}} integration {{over the}} ordered pairs can yield the Fourier transform output value for any desired {{value of the}} conjugate Fourier transform variable (frequency, for example), so that a spectrum can be produced at any desired step size and over any desired <b>variable</b> <b>range</b> for accurate determination of amplitudes, frequencies, and phases corresponding to isolated peaks. Unlike limitations in DFT and FFT methods, explicit numerical integration can have any desired step size and compute the Fourier transform over any desired range of the congugate Fourier transform variable (for example, frequency).|$|E
2500|$|Extensive work in {{biometry}} {{seemed to}} indicate that continuous natural variation had distinct limits and did not represent heritable changes. Embryological development posed an additional problem in Morgan's view, as selection could not act on the early, incomplete stages of highly complex organs such as the eye. The common solution of the Lamarckian mechanism of inheritance of acquired characters, which featured prominently in Darwin's theory, was increasingly rejected by biologists. According to Morgan's biographer Garland Allen, he was also hindered by his views on taxonomy: he thought that species were entirely artificial creations that distorted the continuously <b>variable</b> <b>range</b> of real forms, while he held a [...] "typological" [...] view of larger taxa and could see no way that one such group could transform into another. But while Morgan was skeptical of natural selection for many years, his theories of heredity and variation were radically transformed through his conversion to Mendelism.|$|E
