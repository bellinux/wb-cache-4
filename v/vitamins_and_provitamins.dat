Here, an update of the scientific evidence is reviewed to evaluate plant PAP-enriched foods impact on plasma fat-soluble <b>vitamins</b> <b>and</b> carotenoid levels, and to discuss potential implications in terms of cardiovascular risk. Based on 49 human interventional and 3 bioavailability studies, results showed that regular consumption, particularly over the long term, of foods fortified with PAP as recommended in labelling does not significantly impact plasma <b>vitamins</b> A, D <b>and</b> K concentration. A 10 % significant median reduction was observed for α-tocopherol. Concerning carotenoids, while 13 studies did not demonstrate statistically significant plasma β-carotene reduction, 20 studies showed significant reductions, with median effect size of - 24 %. This decline can be mitigated or offset by increased fruits and vegetables consumption. Furthermore, higher cardiovascular risk was observed for differences in plasma β-carotene concentration of the same magnitude as the estimated average decrease by PAP consumption. These results are supported by the only study of β-carotene bioavailability showing decrease in absorption by phytosterols daily intake...|$|R

40|$|Vitamin {{determination}} is {{a complex}} and challenging task, especially when aimed at the analysis of biological and food samples. Milk is a unique matrix, being {{at the same time}} biological fluid and food with the chemical characteristics of three phases: emulsion, suspension and colloidal solution. Furthermore, it is an almost complete food and an excellent source of vitamins, in particular vitamins A, B 1, B 2, B 5 and B 12. The water-soluble vitamins occur in the serum, while the fat-soluble vitamins and carotenoids are associated to the lipid fraction. Bovine milk {{has been one of the}} most investigated food matrices, but also milk from other animal species deserve to be investigated since it is essential for human diet in several parts of the world. As a matter of fact, India and Pakistan are the main producers of buffalo milk, the second most produced in the world after bovine milk. Europe, China and some zones of Africa are excellent producers of sheep milk, while goat milk is produced in some parts of Asia and in the countries of the Mediterranean area. Donkey milk has a niche market, but it is considered a valuable alternative for people who are allergic to cow milk. In the scientific literature, a large number of papers have focused on the macronutrient composition of bovine milk, while its vitamin and caroteinoid profile still have to be completed. On the other hand, this information is almost completely lacking for buffalo, sheep, goat and donkey milk. Official procedures are based on liquid chromatography with UV-visible or fluorescence detection for the individual determination of vitamins A, E, D and K. The scientific literature describes various methods for multivitamin determination [1 - 8], but most of them are addressed to the analysis of fortified foods. Only two are aimed at the determination of endogenous forms in breast milk [6, 7] and in vegetable foods [8]. This lack of literature is likely due to the several problems coming up during the development of a multivitamin method for the determination of endogenous forms [9]. A first problem concerns the commercial unavailability of authentic standards of some vitamin forms, carotenoids and their geometrical isomers. The subtle structural difference between homologues belonging to the same group hampers their chromatographic separation, whereas the chemical heterogeneity among vitamin groups makes difficult to find common conditions of extraction and detection. However, the development of a simultaneous extraction procedure is the most critical point. In the case of fatty foods such as milk, the high lipid content compromises the extraction efficiency. In the literature, hot saponification is the most adopted solution to free vitamins and carotenoids from saponifiable fraction; nevertheless, this reaction, typically performed at 70 - 80 °C for 30 minutes, is responsible for the rapid decomposition of vitamers K, a severe loss of xanthophylls, the thermal isomerization of all-trans--carotene and vitamin D. Thence, this work was aimed at developing a method, based on the hyphenation HPLC-DAD-tandem MS, to rapidly and completely characterize fat-soluble micronutrients in milk of different species of herbivores (cow, buffalo, sheep, goat, donkey). Overnight cold saponification was optimized as simultaneous extraction procedure. Bovine milk, more easily available, was used to develop the method, which was then optimized for the other types of milk. We have chosen to analyze raw milk, produced by pasture-fed animals, so to avoid the occurrence of vitamins due to the intake of fortified feedstuffs or losses due to the processing. The analyte, were separated by non-aqueous reversed-phase (NARP) chromatography: carotenoids on a C 30 column, while the fat-soluble vitamins on a tandem system of C 18 columns. The atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in positive ion mode was the most suitable technique for the mass-spectrometric detection of -tocopherol, -tocopherol, -tocopherol, ergocalciferol, cholecalciferol, phylloquinone, menaquinone- 4, all-trans-retinol, all-trans-lutein, all-trans-zeaxanthin, all-trans--cryptoxanthin, all-trans--carotene. In addition to the 12 target analytes, the combined DAD-MS detection system allowed the screening of other carotenoids, whose standards are not available on the markets, basing their identification on the expected retention time, the absorbance spectra, acquired between 200 and 700 nm, and the mass-spectrometric data. For each target analyte, the LC-tandem MS method was validated in terms of both quality (identification, selectivity) and quantitative parameters (recoveries, precision, limits of detection and quantitation, sensitivity, linear dynamic range). Regarding the two selected transitions for each analyte, the most intense one was used to perform quantitative analysis, whereas the least intense one for identification purposes. The presence of each compound in matrix was confirmed by matching its retention time and relative abundance of the two SRM transitions with the values of the corresponding standard in solvent. The recoveries, assessed on 6 replicates, were above 80 % for all analytes, with the exception of vitamers K (54 %- 67 %). The relative standard deviations (RSD) associated to recoveries were representative of the intra-day precision, whereas the inter-day precision was estimated as the RSD of 12 replicates performed within 2 weeks. The quantitative analysis was carried out using the standard additions method. The linear dynamic range was investigated up to 200 ng injected for all analytes, while for -retinol and γ-tocopherol up to 2000 ng injected. A linear correlation coefficient greater than 0. 99 was achieved for all the analytes in the different types of milk. After the LC-MS method validation, the whole analytical approach, based on the HPLC-DAD-tandem MS hyphenation, was applied for the characterization of cow, buffalo, goat, sheep and donkey milk. The survey aimed to trace a species-dependent profile, without taking into account the dependence on parameters such as season, stage of lactation and intra- and inter-individual variability. It is known that milk is a good source of vitamin A and E, but the tested milk samples were particularly rich in these vitamins, probably because obtained from pasture-fed animals and analyzed immediately after sampling; on the other hand the milk of donkey was poor of these micronutrients, probably because of its low fat content. As regards vitamin E, α-tocopherol was the most abundant vitamin form (more than vitamin A) found in all kinds of milk analyzed in this work, with the exception of the buffalo one. γ-Tocopherol occurred in lower amount, whereas the δ-homologue was absent in bovine, buffalo, and donkey milk. The vitamers D were detected in buffalo milk, and, in trace amounts, in goat and donkey milk. Although the literature reports for bovine milk the presence of phylloquinone and menaquinones, from MK- 4 to MK- 9 [10, 11], the high selectivity of the developed method allowed excluding the occurrence of MK- 7 in the analyzed milk samples; for this confirmation, the standard of MK- 7 was obtained in our laboratory, purifying a dietary supplement purchased in a drugstore on a semi-preparative column. Among all kinds of milk, cow milk was that had the lowest content of vitamin A but a significant amount of β-carotene and a variety of carotenoids lacking in the other types of milk, with the exception of lutein and zeaxanthin. Missing the authentic standards, the screening of carotenoids in cow milk was achieved by combining LC-DAD-MS data. In formulating a hypothesis to identify a pigment, the UV-Vis spectrum is fundamental; indeed, most of carotenoids show a characteristic three-peak spectrum: the identification is based on the position of the maxima and on the fine structure. For the carotenoids selected in this study, the wavelength of the central peak (MAX) was calculated applying Fieser-Kuhn rules. A cis isomer was identified comparing its spectrum to that of the corresponding all-trans isomer and evaluating: i) the extent of the ipsocromic shift of the λMAX; ii) the hypochromic effect and the reduction of the fine structure of the entire spectrum; iii) the appearance of a "cis"-peak in the near-UV region (330 - 350 nm), iv) the Qratio, i. e. the ratio of the intensity of the cis band to the central band. In this way, on the LC-DAD-MS/MS chromatograms of the bovine milk samples, were identified: zeinoxanthin, all-trans--cryptoxanthin, a cis-isomer of -cryptoxanthin, 3 -hydroxy-β-zeacarotene and β-zeacarotene. It was also detected a group of structural and geometric isomers of all-trans--carotene: a cis-isomer of -carotene, 13 -cis--carotene, all-trans--carotene and -carotene. In all the analyzed samples, it was also found a compound with an absorption maximum at 422 - 424 nm, characteristic of the Soret band; it was probably ascribable to a degradation product of chlorophyll a, generated in rumen of animals. On the other hand, it was not possible to identify two unknown compounds because of the low signal intensity of both detectors. In the case of cow milk, besides raw milk, other categories were analyzed: fresh pasteurized whole milk, biological fresh pasteurized whole milk, high quality fresh whole milk, semi-skimmed fresh milk, UHT, whole yogurt. High levels of vitamins and carotenoids were found in the biological commercial milk while, unexpectedly, low levels occurred in the high quality milk samples. The low concentrations found in the semi-skimmed milk are due to the skimming process which eliminates not only fat but also part of vitamins and carotenoids. Yogurt showed the same micronutrient levels of fresh pasteurized milk. UHT milk was particularly abundant in 13 -cis--carotene, probably produced during the high temperature sterilization because of the thermal isomerization of the all-trans isomer. After this exhaustive characterization, another significant part of this thesis work was further addressed to define the detailed composition of vitamin A vitamers of the same varieties of milk, with the only exception of donkey milk. It has known that the compounds with vitamin A activity are present in milk mainly as retinoids [12]. Among retinoids, the most abundant forms are esters of retinol with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, while only a small fraction is constituted by free retinol. This information has been provided from a single work, based on HPLC-UV and published in 1989 [13]; in that paper the identification of the various forms was exclusively based on the chromatographic retention time, which is a parameter necessary but not sufficient to ensure a certain analyte identification in a complex matrix such as milk. In the present study, cold saponification allowed us to determine the total content of vitamin A as retinol. In order to define the detailed distribution of 17 vitamers A (retinol, retinoic acid, retinal and esters: retinyl caprylate, caprate, palmitoleate, laurate, myristate, pentadecanoate, arachidonate, palmitate, eptadecanoate, linoleate, oleate, stearate, linolenate, eicosanoate) in milk, direct extraction with solvent and a tandem system of reversed phase columns (C 18 /C 18 and C 18 /C 30) coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer were used. Taking into consideration that deuterated structural analogues of these retinoids are not available on the markets, the internal standards were chosen on the basis of what has been reported in literature and results obtained by preliminary tests; accordingly, retinyl propionate was selected as internal standard for the quantitative analysis of retinyl esters with medium-chain fatty acids (8 - 12 carbon atoms), while retinyl arachidonate for esters with longer chain fatty acids. For all analytes, the recoveries, evaluated from the average of six replicates, were  68 %; analytical limits were similar for all four analyzed types of milk, indicating the presence of a similar matrix effect for the different extracts. The linear correlation coefficients of the calibration curves, valued by applying the standard-addition method, were between 0. 9941 and 0. 9999. The validated method was then applied to the analysis of samples of cow, goat, sheep and buffalo milk. In the survey, both qualitative and quantitative differences concerning the composition of retinyl esters were observed in the milk samples from the different animal species. From a qualitative point of view, the results showed the presence of: - 6 retinoids common to the four types of milk: retinol, retinyl linolenate, retinyl oleate, retinyl palmitate, retinyl stearate and retinyl eptadecanoate; - 1 retinoid common to sheep and goat milk, retinyl eicosanoate; - 1 retinoid common to cow and buffalo milk, retinyl linoleate; - 1 retinoid characteristic of goat milk, retinyl caprate; - 1 retinoid characteristic of cow milk, retinyl myristate. From a quantitative point of view, buffalo milk differed from the others for the highest concentration of free retinol and retinyl linolenate; this latter form was about seven times higher than bovine milk. Furthermore, buffalo milk showed the highest content of retinyl palmitate, even if a considerable concentration was also found in sheep milk. Milk of small ruminants was characterized by a content of retinyl eptadecanoate from 4 to 6 times higher than cow and buffalo milk. In this work, the distribution of retinyl caprate, laurate, pentadecanoate, palmitoleate and myristate in bovine milk resulted different from that presented in the only pre-existing work [13]. In particular, the authors found retinyl caprate in cow milk but not in goat milk; this result is anomalous since capric acid is particularly abundant in goat milk. In addition, retinyl palmitate followed by retinyl oleate were always found to be the most abundant vitamers A, while our results agree with these observations only partially. In conclusion, the interest in this work is motivated by several reasons: firstly, a LC-DAD-MS based approach was proposed for a complete characterization of fat-soluble micronutrients in milk, providing a more certain identification than methods reported in the literature. Secondly, detailed data on the composition of fat-soluble micronutrients were achieved for five kinds of milk, filling the information gap of literature. Eventually, it could provide a tool to detect adulteration: - this work has definitively established that β-carotene (and other provitamin A carotenoids) occurs only in cow milk; so, traces of β-carotene in buffalo mozzarella could indicate use of bovine milk during its production. - another finding of this work is the very high concentration of retinyl linolenate in buffalo milk and retinyl eicosanoate in sheep milk; these esters could be simple biomarkers to detect other kinds of adulteration.

In this work, a new procedure based on a sequential extraction and analysis of both types of vitamins is presented. The procedure couples several simple extraction steps to LC–MS/MS and LC–DAD in order to quantify the free vitamins contents in fresh-cut vegetables before and after a 10 -days storage period. The developed method allows the correct quantification of vitamins C, B 1, B 2, B 3, B 5, B 6, B 9, E <b>and</b> <b>provitamin</b> A in ready-to-eat green leafy vegetable products including green lettuce, ruby red lettuce, watercress, swiss chard, lamb's lettuce, spearmint, spinach, wild rocket, pea leaves, mizuna, garden cress and red mustard. Using this optimized methodology, low LOQs were attained for the analyzed vitamins in less than 100 min, including extraction <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> analysis using 2 optimized procedures; good repeatability and linearity was achieved for all vitamins studied, while recoveries ranged from 83 % to 105 %. The most abundant free vitamins found in leafy vegetable products were <b>vitamin</b> C, <b>provitamin</b> A <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> E. The richest sample on <b>vitamin</b> C <b>and</b> <b>provitamin</b> A was pea leaves (154 mg/g fresh weight and 14. 4 mg/ 100 g fresh weight, respectively), whereas lamb's lettuce was the vegetable with the highest content on vitamin E (3. 1 mg/ 100 g fresh weight). Generally, some losses of vitamins were detected after storage, although the behavior of each vitamin varied strongly among samples.

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} has been provided for a connection between retinoid metabolism and the activity of peroxisome proliferator receptors (Ppars) in the control of body fat reserves. Two different precursors for retinoids exist in the diet as preformed <b>vitamin</b> A (all-trans-retinol) <b>and</b> <b>provitamin</b> A (β,β-carotene). For retinoid production, β,β-carotene is converted to retinaldehyde by β,β-carotene monooxygenase 1 (Bcmo 1). Previous analysis showed that Bcmo 1 knock-out mice develop dyslipidemia and {{are more susceptible to}} diet-induced obesity. However, the role of Bcmo 1 for adipocyte retinoid metabolism has yet not been well defined. Here, we showed that Bcmo 1 mRNA and protein expression are induced during adipogenesis in NIH 3 T 3 -L 1 cells. In mature adipocytes, β,β-carotene but not all-trans-retinol was metabolized to retinoic acid (RA). RA decreased the expression of Pparγ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, key lipogenic transcription factors, and reduced the lipid content of mature adipocytes. This process was inhibited by the retinoic acid receptor antagonist LE 450, showing that it involves canonical retinoid signaling. Accordingly, gavage of β,β-carotene but not all-trans-retinol induced retinoid signaling and decreased Pparγ expression in white adipose tissue of vitamin A-deficient mice. Our study identifies β,β-carotene as a critical physiological precursor for RA production in adipocytes <b>and</b> implicates <b>provitamin</b> A as a dietary regulator of body fat reserves...|$|R

40|$|Deterioriation of {{palm oil}} {{fortified}} with <b>vitamin</b> A <b>and</b> <b>provitamin</b> A could {{be caused by}} the presence of oxygen and light exposure. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of the initial peroxide value (PV) in palm oil (1. 99, 3. 98, and 9. 95 meq O 2 /kg oil) and light intensity (15000, 10000, and 5000 lux) on the rate of oxidation and the shelf life of palm oil fortified with Red Palm Oil (RPO) equal to 45 IU vitamin A. The RPO contained β-carotene as provitamin A in the amount of 504. 67 ppm. The PV and free fatty acid (FFA) content were observed as the parameters of oil deterioriation during storage. The results showed that the rate of PV was influenced by light intensity, while the rate of FFA formation were more influenced by the amount of initial PV in the oil. Based on the palm oil standard quality for PV (SNI 7709 : 2012), the shelf life of palm oil with the lowest initial PV at ambient temperature was 9. 5 days, while that with the highest PV was 1. 32 hours. The deterioration rate of RPO fortified palm oil due to light exposure was also compared with its deterioration rate due to heat and the deterioration rate of palm oil fortified with vitamin A. The shelf life of vitamin A fortified palm oil stored in the dark was 90. 67 days, while RPO fortified palm oil was 68. 12 days. This shelf life results showed that RPO had a potency as provitamin A fortificant for palm oil as long as it is stored in a closed container in the dark...|$|R
40|$|Vitamin A {{deficiency}} {{is a major}} {{nutritional disorder}} in {{a large number of}} developing countries. The disorder is mainly caused by an inadequate intake of preformed <b>vitamin</b> A <b>and</b> <b>provitamin</b> A carotenoids from the diet. It is also recognized that <b>vitamin</b> A deficiency <b>and</b> iron deficiency tend to coexist in many population groups. On the other hand, recent studies have indicated that <b>vitamin</b> A <b>and</b> β-carotene might {{have a positive effect on}} iron absorption. The aim of the present thesis was to evaluate orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) as a food source of <b>provitamin</b> A carotenoids <b>and</b> to study the interactive effects between β-carotene and iron on their respective uptake in an in vitro model. The effects of various processing and drying methods on the retention of all-trans-β-carotene in OFSP were investigated with a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The interactive effects of a simultaneous uptake of β-carotene from micelles and iron were studied using a Caco- 2 cell model. Results showed that OFSP contains considerable amounts of all-trans-β-carotene (108 - 315 μg/g dry matter) and that the amount is highly dependent on the variety. Traditional preparation methods resulted in moderate losses of all-trans-β-carotene (approximately 78 % of the all-trans-β-carotene content was retained) and the effects of boiling, steaming, and deep-frying were similar. These results demonstrate that one 100 g ready-to-eat portion of four out of the seven OFSP varieties in the present study would provide enough all-trans-β-carotene to completely cover the daily vitamin A requirements for preschool children. The in vitro model using Caco- 2 cells showed that the uptake of β-carotene was significantly reduced (p < 0. 05) in the presence of physiological amounts of ferrous chloride (30 μmol/L). There was further an inverse relationship (r 2 = 0. 93, p < 0. 05) between the uptake of β-carotene and concentration of ferrous iron in the test solution provided to the Caco- 2 cells.

40|$|The {{data for}} vitamin A include {{chemically}} determined preformed <b>vitamin</b> A <b>and</b> <b>provitamin</b> A. <b>Vitamin</b> A {{values in the}} tables are shown as micrograms of retinol and/or micrograms of carotene and also as international units of retinol potency per 100 9 edible por-tion of the foods. The term "carotene " {{is used for the}} total mixed carotenoids with vitamin A activity analyzed. In fact, the carotenes analyzed consisted of a large portion of f 3 -carotene and a small portion of a-carotene. One retinol potency (IU) is equivalent to 0. 3 /lg of retinol or 1. 8 /lg (0. 6 /lg X 3) of carotene, which means that the biologic activity of carotenoids is considered to be one-third that of retinol, mainly due to the inferior absorption of carotene. However, as an exception, in milk and dairy products 1 IU is considered to be equivalent to 0. 6 /lg of carotene. As for the foods for which both retinol and carotene contents are given in the table, the retinol potency is calculated by addition of values derived from both retinol and carotene. There are considerable differences in vitamin A values of some foods between the third revised edition and the fourth revised edition of the Standard Tables of Food Composition in Japan. The mean daily vitamin A intake of Japanese people as determined by the recent national nutrition survey was 2, 120 IU when the calculation was made from the data in the fourth revised edition and 1, 762 tU when the calculation was made from the data in the third revised edition, indicating approximately a 20 % larger value in the former than the latter.

Currently, vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is still common worldwide with an estimated total number of one billion people, and over 50 % of the population in Asia. Edible mushrooms are a good source of various vitamins but have a low or negligible content of vitamin D. UV radiation has been found effective to stimulate the accumulation of vitamin D from the conversion of ergosterol in edible mushrooms. King oyster mushroom (Pleurotus eryngii) {{is one of the most}} popular and tasty edible mushrooms. However, the content and dynamic trend of vitamin D in king oyster mushroom during UV irradiation are still not well characterized. This study was focused on the accumulation of some important vitamin D species (e. g. D 2 and D 4) and their dynamic relationships in King oyster mushrooms during UV-B irradiation. Our first study was on the stimulation of <b>vitamin</b> D 2 <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> D 4 accumulation in the oyster mushrooms by UVB irradiation for various periods of time. The contents of <b>vitamin</b> D 2 <b>and</b> D 4 showed a linear increase with time (D 2 : y = 0. 998 x + 15. 75, r² = 0. 973; D 4 : y = 0. 081 x + 0. 389, r² = 0. 834), <b>and</b> <b>provitamin</b> D 2 a linear decrease (y = 0. 003 x + 2. 09, r 2 = 0. 942) within 30 minute of UVB irradiation.

The objective of the present thesis was to evaluate orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) as a biofortified food source of provitamin A carotenoids with a potential to be included in a diet for alleviating vitamin A deficiency. The effects of various thermal processing and drying methods on the retention and in vitro bioaccessibility of β-carotene in OFSP were investigated using HPLC and an in vitro digestion model. The cell structure and β-carotene morphology in fresh and thermally processed OFSP were visualized by brightfield and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy. The interactive effects of simultaneous uptake of β-carotene from micelles and iron were studied using a Caco- 2 cell model. Biofortified OFSP cultivars from Uganda contained high levels of all-trans-β-carotene ranging from 108 to 315 μg/g dry weight. Traditional preparation methods resulted in moderate losses of β-carotene with approximately 78 % of the all-trans-β-carotene content retained, and the effects of boiling, steaming and deep-frying were similar. However, the degree of cell wall damage strongly influenced the in vitro bioaccessibility of β-carotene, which was clearly indicated by the 31 % to 50 % transfer of all-trans-β-carotene from the OFSP matrix to the micellar phase in samples that were homogenized prior to boiling, considerably higher than in samples that were thermally treated prior to homogenization (11 % to 22 %). These findings correlated qualitatively very well with the differences observed in size and number of β-carotene bodies in the in vitro digested samples. Furthermore, β-carotene bodies were co-located with starch granules in the OFSP matrix. The Caco- 2 cell model showed that the uptake of β-carotene was reduced in the presence of physiological amounts of ferrous chloride, and this effect was concentration dependent. However, no evidence of an impact of β-carotene on iron uptake was observed. The results in the present thesis indicate that a meal supplemented with OFSP together {{with a small amount of}} fat would provide enough β-carotene to completely cover the daily vitamin A requirements for preschool-age children. In summary, the high content and in vitro bioaccessibility of β-carotene from thermally processed OFSP suggests that this food crop can be considered a promising food-based approach to prevent vitamin A deficiency in a sustainable manner...|$|R

The basic cause of this problem {{is related to the}} diet, which contains little preformed <b>vitamin</b> A <b>and</b> plant foods with a low content <b>and</b> bioavailability of <b>provitamin</b> A carotenoids. This thesis reports studies conducted to evaluate the content <b>and</b> bioavailability of <b>provitamin</b> A carotenoids in selected fruits and vegetables from Tanzania and to elucidate the effects of different processing and preparation methods. The <b>vitamin</b> A <b>and</b> <b>provitamin</b> A carotenoid status in pregnant women was assessed in relation to the dietary intake pattern of <b>provitamin</b> A carotenoids <b>and</b> after supplementation with cooking oil. Results showed that leafy vegetables contain high but variable amounts of all- trans -&# 946;-carotene (399 - 914 µg/g dry weight) and minor amounts of &# 945;-carotene, 9 - cis - and 13 - cis -&# 946;-carotene. Fruits contain variable amounts of all- trans -&# 946;-carotene (191 - 5502 µg/ 100 g fresh weight) and some fruits have minor amounts of &# 946;-cryptoxanthin and lycopene. Open sun dried leafy vegetables had significantly (p trans -&# 946;-carotene (53 %) than the fresh vegetables, whereas vegetables dried in solar cabinets showed losses of only about 23 %. Cooking caused variable losses (6 - 51 %) in all- trans -&# 946;-carotene content of the vegetables. The bioaccessibility (amount available for absorption) of the provitamin A carotenoids was estimated with an in vitro digestion method that simulates conditions in the human gastrointestinal tract. The in vitro accessibility of all- trans -&# 946;-carotene was low (4 - 15 %) in vegetables cooked without added oil. However, higher (2 to 5 -fold) in vitro accessibility of all- trans -&# 946;-carotene was obtained in vegetables cooked with added cooking oil. An addition of red palm oil provided significant amounts of accessible provitamin A carotenoids due to its high content of &# 945;- and &# 946;-carotene. Conversion of the amount of accessible provitamin A carotenoids into retinol equivalents according to FAO/WHO recommendations revealed that a median portion of a vegetable relish as consumed by children provided 88 to 477 % of the recommended safe daily intake level (RSDIL) of vitamin A. Portions cooked without oil provided only between 23 and 46 %. The in vitro accessible all- trans -&# 946;-carotene in fruits varied between 7 % and 100 %, and an edible portion of fruit (150 g) would provide between 27 and 216 % of the RSDIL of vitamin A to children. Consumption of preformed vitamin A by pregnant women was very low and higher plasma retinol levels were correlated (p= 0. 03) with higher intakes of vegetables with oil.
