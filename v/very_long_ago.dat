500|$|In December 1901, the MCC {{approved}} the scheme previously suggested—that the county captains should meet {{to discuss the}} fairness of suspected bowlers. It was proposed that any bowler who was judged to be unfair by a two-to-one majority of captains would be banned {{for at least a}} season. The MCC also recommended that the counties not play suspected bowlers and that any bowler called for throwing should be removed from the attack {{in the interests of the}} spirit of cricket. In the 1902 Wisden, Sydney Pardon wrote: [...] "Never in the last twenty years or more has there been so little unfair or doubtful bowling as in the season of 1901. Indeed the improvement was so marked as to make it clear that, if the captains stick to their guns, we shall soon be entirely free from the evil of which not <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> it seemed impossible to get rid." [...] After 1901, there were only isolated incidents regarding illegal bowling actions until the Second World War, and throwing ceased to be an issue in English cricket, in which no cricketer was no-balled for throwing between 1908 and 1952.|$|E
2500|$|Because of its {{widespread}} influence, Don Quixote {{also helped}} cement the modern Spanish language.

2500|$|Not so <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> {{our nation}} tolerated slavery in our colonies. Philanthropists {{endeavored}} to destroy slavery; but when was it utterly abolished? It was when Wilberforce roused {{the church of}} God, and when the church of God addressed herself to the conflict, then she tore the evil thing to pieces. I have been amused with what Wilberforce said the day after they passed the Act of Emancipation. He merrily said to a friend {{when it was all}} done, [...] "Is there not something else we can abolish?" [...] That was said playfully, but it shows the spirit of the church of God. She lives in conflict and victory; her mission is to destroy everything that is bad in the land.|$|E

When we were down there last time he says to me, 'I didn't tell you when you bought it off me, but that guitar used to be haunted'. I say, 'What are you talking about, Sherman?'. He says, 'There’s 50 solid {{citizens}} here in Como who'll tell you this guitar is haunted. It's the darnedest thing – we’d leave it over in the potato barn and we'd come back in and it would be moved. You'd put it down somewhere and the next morning you’d come back and it would have moved. When you took that guitar the ghost in the barn left'. He told me this not <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> and I said to him, 'Sherman!

The main course usually includes a serving of meat, such as roast or kotlet schabowy (breaded pork cutlet), or chicken.
