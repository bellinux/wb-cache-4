25|$|In {{economics}} and especially macroeconomics, {{the effects of}} proposed policy actions, such as fiscal policy changes or monetary policy changes, are simulated to judge their desirability. A mathematical model of the economy, having been fitted to historical economic data, {{is used as a}} proxy for the actual economy; proposed values of government spending, taxation, open market operations, etc. are used as inputs to the simulation of the model, and various <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> such as the inflation rate, the unemployment rate, the balance of trade deficit, the government budget deficit, etc. are the outputs of the simulation. The simulated values of these <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> are compared for different proposed policy inputs to determine which set of outcomes is most desirable.|$|E
25|$|SOMs {{have been}} helpful to {{researchers}} in identifying and investigating the constraints and <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{in a number of}} acquisition processes, and in exploring the consequences of these findings on linguistic and cognitive theories. By identifying working memory as an important constraint both for language learners and for current computational models, researchers have been able to show that manipulation of this variable allows for syntactic bootstrapping, drawing not just categorical but actual content meaning from words' positional co-occurrence in sentences.|$|E
25|$|Hierarchical {{linear models}} (or {{multilevel}} regression) organizes the data into {{a hierarchy of}} regressions, for example where A is regressed on B, and B is regressed on C. It is often used where the <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> have a natural hierarchical structure such as in educational statistics, where students are nested in classrooms, classrooms are nested in schools, and schools are nested in some administrative grouping, such as a school district. The response variable might be a measure of student achievement such as a test score, and different covariates would be collected at the classroom, school, and school district levels.|$|E

From the two numerical examples used (when the population correlation coefficient is positive and negative), {{it was observed that}} the ratio and product estimators that made use of information on auxiliary <b>variable</b> and <b>variable</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> not yet drawn always performed better once all of their conditions were met...|$|R

25|$|One {{approach}} to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is to incorporate stochastic (random) behaviour into the system. Stochastic behaviour destroys {{information contained in}} the ensemble. While this is technically inaccurate (aside from hypothetical situations involving black holes, a system cannot in itself cause loss of information), the randomness is added to reflect that information of interest becomes converted over time into subtle correlations within the system, or to correlations between the system and environment. These correlations appear as chaotic or pseudorandom influences on the <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> By replacing these correlations with randomness proper, the calculations can be made much easier.|$|E
25|$|Macroeconomic {{policy-making}} is {{a context}} requiring multi-objective optimization. Typically {{a central bank}} must choose a stance for monetary policy that balances competing objectives — low inflation, low unemployment, low balance of trade deficit, etc. To do this, the central bank uses {{a model of the}} economy that quantitatively describes the various causal linkages in the economy; it simulates the model repeatedly under various possible stances of monetary policy, in order to obtain a menu of possible predicted outcomes for the various <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Then in principle it can use an aggregate objective function to rate the alternative sets of predicted outcomes, although in practice central banks use a non-quantitative, judgement-based, process for ranking the alternatives and making the policy choice.|$|E
25|$|In much of macroecology, {{the use of}} EOO as {{a measure}} of range size may be {{appropriate}}; however, AOO is a more appropriate measure when evaluating O–A relationships. In macroecological investigations that are primarily biogeographical in nature, the <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> can be expected to vary most from one extent of occurrence to the opposite, and less so through discontinuities contained within the total EOO. However, when investigating O-A relationships, the area occupied by a species is the variable of interest, and the inclusion of discontinuities within the EOO could significantly influence results. In the extreme case where occupied habitats are distributed at random throughout the EOO, a relationship between abundance and range size (EOO) would not be expected. Because O–A relationships have strong conservation implications, Gaston and Fuller have argued that clear distinctions need to be made as to the purpose of the EOO and AOO as measures of range size, and that in association with O-A relationships the AOO is the more useful measure of species abundance.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} and implements {{a simple}} {{approach to the}} most common problem in applied microeconometrics: estimating a linear causal effct when the explanatory <b>variable</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> might be correlated with relevant unobserved variables. The main idea is to place restrictions on {{the correlation between the}} <b>variable</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and relevant unobserved variables relative to the correlation between the <b>variable</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and observed control variables. These relative correlation restrictions allow a researcher to construct informative bounds on parameter estimates, and to assess the sensitivity of conventional estimates to plausible deviations from the identifying assumptions. The estimation method and its properties are described, and two empirical applications are demonstrated. sensitivity analysis, partial identification, endogeneity...|$|R

2500|$|Artificial languages, that is, {{small-scale}} languages {{that typically}} have an extremely limited vocabulary and simplified grammar rules, are a commonly used paradigm for psycholinguistic researchers. Artificial languages allow researchers to isolate <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and wield {{a greater degree}} of control over the input the subject will receive. Unfortunately, the overly simplified nature of these languages and the absence of a number of phenomena common to all human natural languages such as rhythm, pitch changes, and sequential regularities raise questions of external validity for any findings obtained using this paradigm, even after {{attempts have been made to}} increase the complexity and richness of the languages used.
