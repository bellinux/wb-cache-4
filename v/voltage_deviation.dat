Modern power systems sometimes operate with heavily loaded lines resulting in power system to work under condition of higher power loss and higher <b>voltage</b> <b>deviation.</b> Sometimes, it may lead to voltage instability or system collapse. The emergence of power electronic based FACTS technology such as Static Var Compensator (SVC) has been of great help in improving the operation of power systems as it reduces the power system instability problem, power losses and <b>voltage</b> <b>deviation.</b> Placing FACTS devices at proper locations can serve the purpose of improving voltage levels and reducing losses in the system.

40|$|Abstract- The {{dead time}} {{necessary}} to prevent the short circuit of the power supply in pulse width modulated (PWM) voltage inverters results in output <b>voltage</b> <b>deviations.</b> Although individually small, when accumulated over an operating cycle, the <b>voltage</b> <b>deviations</b> are sufficient to distort the applied PWM signal. This paper presents a new method to correct for the dead time deviations. The Pulse Based Compensator is less hardware and software intensive than other dead time compensation methods providing a low cost solution. The pulse based technique is developed by analyzing the effects of dead time on a pulse by pulse basis and correcting each pulse accordingly. The technique is evaluated through simulation and experimental results. Other compensation methods are evaluated and the results compared with the pulse based technique. This comparison indicates previous methods can produce magnitude and phase errors in the applied terminal voltage, whereas the proposed method compensates for the dead time without significant magnitude and phase errors in the terminal voltage of PWM voltage source inverters...|$|R

30|$|This study investigates {{a hybrid}} {{hierarchical}} multi-agent system for distributed cooperative voltage control in active distribution networks. The hybrid hierarchical multi-agent system adopts on-load tap-changing (OLTC) agents for the distribution transformers and feeder control section (FCS) agents for the distributed generators (DGs). The {{objective is to}} minimize the <b>voltage</b> <b>deviations</b> over the network. The FCS agents also {{have the objective of}} minimizing reductions in DG power output. A least squares method is used for curve fitting to achieve the two objectives. The OLTC agent receives voltage information from the FCS agents to evaluate the state of the voltage in each feeder and the distribution network and cooperates with the FCS agents to control the voltage of the network. The FCS agents exchange the fitted curve parameters and basic information on the DGs with other agents to achieve the objectives. The effectiveness of the proposed distributed cooperative voltage control scheme is verified through simulations. Depending on the network voltages obtained by the OLTC agent, different operations are executed to prevent voltage limit violations and to minimize the <b>voltage</b> <b>deviations</b> and reductions in the DG power outputs.|$|R
40|$|Voltage ranking is an {{important}} part of power system security assessment. The commonly used performance index method with a low exponent could suffer from masking effects. This paper proposes a generic compensation factor to reduce the masking problem. An adaptive fuzzy system is used for the calculation of the generic compensation factor. A simplification of the defuzzification process is proposed for improvement of computational efficiency. Convergence analysis shows that values calculated by the adaptive fuzzy system are good approximations. The parameters would only need to be calculated offline once. They can then be applied to various systems for voltage ranking applications. To save computational efforts further, a hybrid strategy is introduced to reduce the number of fuzzy rules.

For an increasing electric vehicle penetration rate and an increasing amount of reactive power injection, {{the impact on the}} residential <b>voltage</b> <b>deviations,</b> peak load, and grid losses is calculated.

However, the cost related to the increased apparent power rating of the vehicle chargers, required to supply the reactive power, should be assessed compared to the mentioned advantages. If the benefits outweigh the costs, reactive power support could be considered in the grid compliance requirements of electric vehicle chargers, as it allows deferring distribution grid infrastructure investments. status: publishe...|$|R
