40|$|AbstractThis study {{compared}} the clinical {{performance of the}} St. Jude Medical and Medtronic <b>Hall</b> mechanical <b>valves</b> in isolated aortic or mitral valve replacement. From 1984 to 1993, 349 St. Jude Medical valves (aortic 237, mitral 112) and 465 Medtronic <b>Hall</b> <b>valves</b> (aortic 272, mitral 193) were implanted in 814 patients at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. The patients had similar preoperative characteristics. The hospital mortality rate for aortic valve replacement was 3. 4 % with the St. Jude Medical valve and 5. 8 % with the Medtronic <b>Hall</b> <b>valve</b> (p = 0. 26) and the rate for mitral valve replacement was 8. 9 % with the St. Jude Medical valve and 11. 9 % with the Medtronic <b>Hall</b> <b>valve</b> (p = 0. 54). Actuarial estimates of survival and freedom from complications were calculated. At 5 years the actuarial probability of survival (including hospital deaths) for aortic valve replacement was 86 % ± 3 % with the St. Jude Medical valve and 68 % ± 4 % with the Medtronic <b>Hall</b> <b>valve</b> (p = 0. 0001) and for mitral valve replacement was 75 % ± 7 % with the St. Jude Medical valve and 70 % ± 4 % with the Medtronic <b>Hall</b> <b>valve</b> (p = 0. 54). The {{most common cause of}} late death was cardiac failure and no deaths were caused by structural failure. The 5 -year probability of freedom from bleeding after aortic valve replacement was 99 % ± 1 % with the St. Jude Medical valve and 95 % ± 2 % with the Medtronic <b>Hall</b> <b>valve</b> (p = 0. 06) and after mitral valve replacement 99 % ± 1 % with the St. Jude Medical valve and 97 % ± 2 % with the Medtronic <b>Hall</b> <b>valve</b> (p = 0. 37). The 5 -year probability of freedom from thromboembolism after aortic valve replacement was 88 % ± 4 % with the St. Jude Medical valve and 81 % ± 3 % with the Medtronic <b>Hall</b> <b>valve</b> (p = 0. 08) and after mitral valve replacement was 85 % ± 7 % with the St. Jude Medical valve and 77 % ± 5 % with the Medtronic <b>Hall</b> <b>valve</b> (p = 0. 17). Reoperation was uncommon and there were no cases of structural valve failure. The 5 -year actuarial estimate of freedom from reoperation therefore for aortic valve replacement was 99 % ± 1 % with the St. Jude Medical valve and 96 % ± 2 % with the Medtronic <b>Hall</b> <b>valve</b> (p = 0. 09) and for mitral valve replacement was 98 % ± 2 % with the St. Jude Medical valve and 95 % ± 3 % with the Medtronic <b>Hall</b> <b>valve</b> (p = 0. 40). We concluded that the St. Jude Medical and Medtronic <b>Hall</b> mechanical <b>valves</b> offered similar clinical performance in isolated aortic or mitral valve replacement.

40|$|AbstractObjective: To {{assess the}} {{performance}} of the Medtronic <b>Hall</b> <b>valve</b> (Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) in one institution over a 20 -year period. Methods: Since 1979, Medtronic <b>Hall</b> <b>valves</b> have been used in 1766 procedures (736 aortic, 796 mitral, and 234 double). Patients were followed up prospectively at 6 - to 12 -month intervals for a total of 12, 688 follow-up years. Anticoagulation data (international normalized ratio) were recorded for all patients (approximately 95, 000 observations). Results: Linearized rates of valve-related late death for aortic, mitral, and double valve replacement were 0. 8 %/y, 0. 9 %/y, and 1. 1 %/y, respectively. Risk factors for late mortality were (relative risk) diabetes (1. 9), decade of age (1. 6), concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (1. 4), hypertension (1. 3), non-sinus rhythm (1. 3), large valve size (1. 1), valve regurgitation (1. 3), and male sex (1. 2). For aortic, mitral, and double valve replacement, linearized rates (percent per year) of adverse events were valve thrombosis 0. 04, 0. 03, and 0. 0; all thromboembolism 2. 3, 4. 0, and 3. 4; stroke 0. 6, 0. 8, and 0. 6; major hemorrhage 1. 2, 1. 4, and 1. 6; and prosthetic endocarditis 0. 4, 0. 4, and 0. 7. Risk factors for thromboembolism were (relative risk) mitral valve replacement (1. 9), diabetes (1. 8), hypertension (1. 5), and history of embolism (1. 4). Conclusion: At 20 years the Medtronic <b>Hall</b> <b>valve</b> demonstrates excellent durability, good hemodynamic performance, and very low thrombogenicity, with a valve thrombosis rate lower than those reported for bileaflet designs. With this prosthesis, both survival and thromboembolic events are predominantly determined by patient risk factors. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2001; 121 : 1090 - 100...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Orientation {{for optimal}} {{systolic}} performance of tilting disc and bileaflet aortic valves was defined in previous studies. The present study investigates {{the influence of}} valve orientation on coronary artery flow in an animal model. Methods: A rotation device holding either a Medtronic Hall tilting disc (n = 4; Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, Minn), a St Jude Medical bileaflet (n = 4; St Jude Medical, Inc, St Paul, Minn), or a Medtronic Advantage bileaflet (n = 3) aortic valve was implanted. The device allowed rotation of the valve without reopening the aorta. Flow through the left anterior descending coronary artery was measured preoperatively and at normal versus high cardiac output after weaning from extracorporeal circulation. Measurements were performed at {{the best and worst}} hemodynamic position, as defined previously. Results: Coronary flow rates were similar in all animals preoperatively (26 ± 4. 1 mL/min). After aortic valve replacement, left anterior descending flow increased significantly to 58. 2 ± 10. 6 mL/min. Highest flow rates at normal cardiac output were found in the optimum orientation, especially for the Medtronic <b>valves</b> (Medtronic <b>Hall,</b> 64 ± 8. 7 mL/min; Medtronic Advantage, 64. 6 ± 11. 6 mL/min; St Jude Medical, 48. 3 ± 10. 3 mL/min), whereas the worst position demonstrated significantly lower left anterior descending flow, with no differences among <b>valves</b> (Medtronic <b>Hall,</b> 37. 5 ± 1. 3 mL/min; St Jude Medical, 35. 7 ± 10. 7 mL/min; Medtronic Advantage, 39. 8 ± 10 mL/min). Left anterior descending artery flow increased significantly with higher cardiac output. Conclusions: Coronary blood flow was significantly influenced by mechanical aortic valve implantation and the orientation of prostheses. For both valve designs, the previously defined optimum orientation with respect to pressure gradients and turbulence demonstrated the highest left anterior descending flow rates. Even in its optimum orientation, the St Jude Medical valve showed significantly lower coronary flow than the other valves. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2002; 124 : 925 - 3...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Our {{objective}} was to evaluate the degree of change in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) regression after aortic valve replacement (AVR) using three different valves. Methods: Group 1 (n= 17) included patients with bioprosthesis (Medtronic Hancock 2), Group 2 (n= 21) included patients with mono-leaflet mechanical <b>valve</b> (Medtronic <b>Hall),</b> and Group 3 (n= 17) included patients with bi-leaflet mechanical valve (St Jude). The mean ages of Group 1, 2 and 3 patients were 70. 8 ± 9. 1, 61. 6 ± 13. 7 and 56. 2 ± 18. 3 years, respectively. In this observational study, patients were followed-up after surgery and left ventricular wall thickness and valvular functions were evaluated with echocardiography. The findings were compared with preoperative values. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way variance analysis (ANOVA), Kruskal Wallis, and Chi-square tests. Results: Statistically significant difference was observed among the three groups with respect to age (p= 0. 015). LVMI regressed in all groups; Group 1 from 232. 74 ± 53. 36 g/m 2 (preoperative) to 174. 64 ± 46. 33 g/m 2 (postoperative) (p= 0. 0001), Group 2 -from 198. 49 ± 40. 53 g/m 2 to 167. 04 ± 33. 9 g/m 2 (p= 0. 0001), and Group 3 - 228. 77 ± 47. 87 g/m 2 to 185. 44 ± 37. 76 g/m 2 (p= 0. 0001). No statistically significant difference was observed among the groups with respect to LVMI regression (p= 0. 054, p= 0. 363). Conclusion: Mid-term results of AVR with three different aortic valve prosthesis revealed that all groups showed a similar regression of left ventricular mass.

40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{sought to}} assess the effect of anticoagulation control on {{long-term}} survival after valve replacement with the Medtronic <b>Hall</b> <b>valve</b> (Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, Minn). Methods: Prospective follow-up data, including 82, 297 international normalized ratios, were collected for 1476 patients undergoing single valve replacement with the Medtronic <b>Hall</b> <b>valve</b> between 1979 and 1994, with follow-up {{to the end of}} 1998. After excluding 204 patients who either died within 30 days or had fewer than 10 international normalized ratios recorded beyond 30 days, there were 10, 203 patient years of follow-up for analysis. Anticoagulation variability was measured as the percentage of international normalized ratios outside a target range of 2. 0 to 4. 0 for each patient. Results: Linearized rates for late death rose progressively with increasing deciles of anticoagulation variability for both aortic and mitral valve replacement (2. 7 % and 3. 3 % per year, respectively, in deciles 1 and 2 up to 9. 5 % and 14. 6 % per year, respectively, in deciles 6 - 10; P <. 001). Survival at 15 years after aortic valve replacement was 59 % for low anticoagulation variability (deciles 1 and 2), 55 % for intermediate anticoagulation variability (decile 3), and 28 % for high anticoagulation variability (deciles 4 - 10); survivals at 15 years after mitral valve replacement were 56 %, 42 %, and 24 %, respectively (P <. 001 between low-intermediate anticoagulation variability and high anticoagulation variability for both aortic and mitral valve replacement). On multivariate analysis, significant predictors of reduced survival were anticoagulation variability per 20 % increase (hazard ratio, 1. 8), diabetes (hazard ratio, 1. 6), decade of age (hazard ratio, 1. 6), concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (hazard ratio, 1. 5), male sex (hazard ratio, 1. 4), hypertension (hazard ratio, 1. 4), New York Heart Association class III or IV (hazard ratio, 1. 3), and non-sinus rhythm (hazard ratio, 1. 2). Patients with low anticoagulation variability who were in sinus rhythm and did not have diabetes, coronary bypass grafting, or hypertension had survivals equal to those of the age- and sex-matched general population at 15 years. The incidence of valve-related deaths was significantly higher with high anticoagulation variability compared with the incidence with low-intermediate anticoagulation variability for both aortic (1. 4 % vs 0. 5 % per year, P <. 001) and mitral valve replacement (1. 5 % vs 0. 5 % per year, P <. 001). By means of univariate analysis, high anticoagulation variability was significantly associated with New York Heart Association class III or IV at 5 years postoperatively (P <. 001) and with age of greater than 60 years {{at the time of the}} operation (P =. 002). Conclusions: High anticoagulation variability is the most important independent predictor of reduced survival after valve replacement with a mechanical valve. Better anticoagulation control should improve survival. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2002; 123 : 715 - 2...|$|R

50|$|In 2004, Sylmar East {{station was}} {{upgraded}} from 1,100 MW to 3,100 MW (rededicated as the Sylmar Converter Station in 2005).

The upgrade was made to eliminate the environmental risks of mercury and to reduce the maintenance costs of the obsolete mercury arc valves.|$|E
50|$|The {{converter}} valves are twelve-pulse converters, arranged {{as three}} water-cooled quadrivalve assemblies. Both Pole 2 and Pole 3 use {{a design that}} suspends the quadrivalves {{from the roof of}} the <b>valve</b> <b>hall.</b> This provides superior seismic performance compared with a ground mounted arrangement, especially in New Zealand's highly seismic environment. There are three single phase converter transformers for each converter valve, and each transformer has two secondary windings connected to the valve.|$|E
50|$|The DC voltage in the {{intermediate}} circuit can be selected freely at HVDC back-to-back stations {{because of the}} short conductor length. The DC voltage is usually selected to be as low as possible, {{in order to build}} a small <b>valve</b> <b>hall</b> and {{to reduce the number of}} thyristors connected in series in each valve. For this reason, at HVDC back-to-back stations, valves with the highest available current rating (in some cases, up to 4,500 A) are used.|$|E
50|$|All the HVDC {{converters}} use air-insulated, water-cooled thyristor valves, {{suspended from}} {{the ceiling of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>hall</b> and using 125mm diameter thyristors. Both converter stations of Bipole 2 and the Araraquara converter station of Bipole 1 use single-phase, two-winding converter transformers with the thyristor valves arranged in double-valves, but the Porto Velho Bipole 1 converter station used single-phase three-winding converter transformers (because the river made the transport of larger transformers feasible than was the case at Araraquara) and valves arranged in quadrivalves.|$|E
50|$|The {{converter}} {{is usually}} {{installed in a}} building called the <b>valve</b> <b>hall.</b> Early HVDC systems used mercury-arc valves, but since the mid-1970s, solid state devices such as thyristors are used. Converters using thyristors or mercury-arc valves are known as line commutated converters. In thyristor-based converters, many thyristors are connected in series to form a thyristor valve and each converter normally consists of six or twelve thyristor valves. The thyristor valves are usually grouped in pairs or groups of four and can stand on insulators on the floor or hang from insulators from the ceiling.|$|E
50|$|Both {{stations}} use air-core inductance smoothing rectifiers of 225 mH and {{a weight}} of 27.5 tonnes, with filters for the 11th, 13th, 24th, and 36th harmonics. Each filter {{consists of a}} coil and a capacitor switched in row. The filters for the 11th and 13th harmonics are adjustable. The filters deliver a reactive power of 95 Mvar. Additional 95 Mvar reactive power is delivered by a capacitor bank. Each station's static inverter, which is switched as a 12-pulse thyristor bridge, consists of 792 thyristors arranged in three 16 m high towers installed in a <b>valve</b> <b>hall.</b>|$|E
