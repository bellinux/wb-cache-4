5|$|After Selvo was deposed, it {{took several}} years for <b>Venice</b> {{to recover from the}} defeat at Corfu and for the Venetians to fully realize the {{immediate}} impact of his actions as Doge. When <b>Venice</b> provided military aid to the Byzantine Empire, they were awarded a Golden Bull by Emperor Alexios I that would provide the Venetians a great economic and strategic advantage throughout the eastern empire for centuries. According to the terms of the decree, annual grants were awarded to all the churches in <b>Venice</b> (including a special gift to the coffers of St Mark's), the Republic was granted whole sections of the Golden Horn in Constantinople, and Venetian merchants were given a full exemption from all taxes and duties throughout the territories of the Byzantine Empire. Not only did this aid the rapid economic growth of <b>Venice</b> in the next few centuries by giving Venetian goods a significant price advantage over other foreign goods, but it initiated a long period of artistic, cultural, and military relationships between <b>Venice</b> and Byzantium. This combination of eastern and western cultural influences made <b>Venice</b> a symbolic gateway between the east and the west in Southern Europe.|$|E

5|$|By 7June 1823, Etty {{felt that}} he had reached the limits of what he could {{accomplish}} in <b>Venice,</b> and was considering returning home. Soon afterwards he left <b>Venice</b> for Florence, with the intention of creating a full-size replica of Titian's Venus of Urbino, considered one of the finest works of the Venetian school of painting. Although the Uffizi management were hostile to this proposal, after 10 days of negotiations they allowed Etty to create his copy. His contemporaries considered it among the finest copies ever made of a painting generally considered to be impossible to copy. In late July Etty began the journey home, pausing for a further two months in <b>Venice.</b> On 8October 1823 Etty finally left <b>Venice,</b> travelling via Mantua and Geneva to Paris.|$|E
