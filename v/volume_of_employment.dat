It is shown that certain patterns of inequality-reducing asset redistribution reduce the incidence of mal-nourishment and the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and thus increase the aggregate level of output in a market economy.

Considerations have been limited to three following aspects of these transformation, and namely: intersectorial evolution, changes of maintenance of the population and increasing professional activity of women. The analysis is based on data taken from seven selected censuses (1921, 1931, 1950, 1970, 1978, 1988) and from three micro-censuses (1974, 1984, 1995). The research made proved that fundamental trend in changes within professional structure is continuous moving of the employees of the 1 st and 2 st sectors to the third one. Such a relative regrouping makes that the share of service sector in general <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> grows larger. Also the image of the Polands’ population in respect of the main source of maintenance underwent some essential changes because of the move of population from the century to the towns and because of increased number of persons who derive their means of maintenance mainly from extra-agricultural sources. One of principal features of modernisation is a growth of professional activity of women. Distributions of the last as presented in the paper made us able to state that a pattern of constant professional activity is still on force in Poland. In such a situation women in Poland do reconcile their job with family duties.

40|$|L'automation relève des {{sciences}} de {{la nature}} et des sciences de l'homme à la fois. Dans cet article, l'auteur s'applique à montrer que l'automation, envisagée comme problème humain, ou par rapport à ses conséquences probables sur la société en général, et sur les travailleurs en particulier, soulève des opinions variées, parfois contradictoires. Il propose un cadre de discussion, qui permette de tenir compte du plus grand nombre d'opinions possibles et il situe l'automation dans la chaîne historique des innovations. Automation {{is a question}} of the day. But opinions on the subject are divided. Professor Weiner, on the one hand, {{had this to say about}} it: "Let us remember that the automatic machine [...] . is the precise economic equivalent of slave labor. Any labor that competes with slave lahor must accept the economic conditions of slave labor. It is perfectly clear that this will produce an unemployment situation, in comparison with which [...] . the depression of the ' 30 will seem a pleasant joke. This depression will ruin many industries — possibly even the industries that have taken advantage of the new potentialities". On the other hand, Mr. D. J. Davis regards automation as a normal achievement and even wonders how our industrial society could go on without it: "We at Ford do not share the apprehensions of some that the increased use of automation equipment may throw thousands of people out of work or otherwise dislocate our economy. Indeed, without automation in the steel, chemical, refining, food processing and cigarette industries — to mention only a few that are much more highly automated than we ever hoped to be — there simply would not be enough production for their products to fill our needs and certainly not at prices we could, afford to pay". Mr. Davis, clearly enough, argues from the viewpoint of a production economist or engineer and is concerned mostly with the increase in efficiency and productivity; while Professor Wiener emphasizes the impact of automation upon the labour market. Both may hold extremist views about it. An inquiry conducted by the McGraw-Hill Department of Economics into 1, 574 companies, 20 % of which had automated their equipment, shows that 26 % of the automated companies recorded a 21 % increase in employment, 23 % a 16 % decrease. In the aggregate, a proportion of 51 % of those companies have recorded no change in global employment. But the report further discloses that automation is apt to change the pattern of the labour market, for it increases the demand for skilled labour. In 40 % of the companies investigated, it required a skilled maintenance personnel; in 21 %, it created the need for an increase in the engineering staff. On the other hand, the demand for unskilled labour declined, giving a 10 % decrease in employment opportunities for that category of labour in the last 25 years, while the chance for a higher percentage of lay-off is forecast for the next 15 years. Although automation is likely to modify the character of the demand for labour over a period it may not change the global <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> Because, however, automation may create such conditions as would stimulate the rise of new industries, the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> should even grow, and then, assuming that those new industries are automated, the impact upon the social structure would be the greater. One may with advantage view automation with reference to the problems raised in economic history by "innovation". A number of inquiries have been made into the impact of innovation upon employment. — particularly with respect to "technological unemployment". The Carroll Report (1886), the Weintraub Report (1940) are cases in point. It may be that innovations are necessary elements in the normal growth of a capitalist society; they are bound to happen, by all means. In terms of normal growth — the long-run view emphasized by traditional economics — the loss incurred as a consequence of innovations is held to be compensated by advantages accrued to society from the same or other innovations. But, as an English economist has put it, in the long run we are all dead. The writer may suggest, by the way, that also in the short run some of us may be "all dead", as a consequence, direct or indirect, of automation. The short-run view emphasizes social adjustment; and social adjustment is one aspect of the general weal. Care must be taken, therefore, that in discussing automation, the perspective be defined in relation to a number of levels of analysis...|$|E
40|$|Les lois Auroux de 1982 ont impulsé, en France, un {{mouvement}} de décentralisation des relations professionnelles. On peut effectivement constater, au cours de la dernière décennie, un développement notable {{des accords}} d'entreprise. Aux yeux de l'observateur, ce mouvement ne doit pas occulter, malgré tout, ni la pérennité des accords de branche, ni l'importante variable des accords d'entreprise selon les secteurs et les tailles d'entreprise ni, enfin, le fait que la dynamique n'est pas nécessairement la même d'un thème de négociation à l'autre. Une enquête menée dans deux secteurs (électronique et santé) permet de spécifier les limites de la décentralisation en matière de négociation sur l'emploi. The 1982 Auroux laws in France served to bring unions and enterprises closer together. Whereas historically labour relations had {{been based on}} confrontation between a labour movement in which the "revolutionary" spirit had prevalled for a long time, and on a management which had carefully avoided the introduction of collective bargaining in firms, the 1980 s were characterized by a significant move towards decentralization of negotiations to enterprises and establishments. In {{the first part of}} this article, it is shown that, in fact, the Auroux laws contributed to this change: in 1981, barely 1500 enterprise — level agreements were registered in France; in 1992 there were 6370 such agreements. Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out three complementary phenomena. First, the law related to employees' freedom of expression has had limited success: according to a recent report, in reality groups for self— expression seldom function and do so poorly. Weak union involvement and management participation policies (quality circles) have undeniably contributed to weakening the interest in and importance of these groups. Secondly, the growth of enterprise — level collective bargaining has not resulted in a decline in industry — wide agreements (their number has remained stable throughout the decade); nor is their growth homogeneous (such agreements are increasingly the reality in large industrial sector firms). Finally, the dynamic varies according to the objects of negotiation. Hence, the following observations: a certain importance given to salaries in negotiations at both the industry and enterprise levels, industry — level negotiation giving way to enterprise — level negotiation regarding work time; a renewal of energy though the volume of agreements remains limited; and interprofessional industry — and enterprise — level negotiations on the issue of employment. The aim of the second part of the article is, precisely, to evaluate the impact of negotiations on the management of employment relations in two sectors that are at first glance opposites: this interest is based on a study conducted by the two authors in which they examine the management of redundant personnel in a sector in crisis (electronics) and the management of labour shortages in a protected public sector (health care). Firstly, during recent years programs have multiplied in the electronics sector to deal with layoffs. In order to institute preventive action, in 1990 and 1991, the social actors established joint committees on employment whose mission was to make forecasts of employment in the industry in order to formulate ways to deal with the effects of fluctuating employment (forecasts of movement of the workforce, establishment of special training programs, and so on). In reality, for reasons related as much to the desire of employers to bring back the management of employment relations to the level of the enterprise as to the difficulty in adjusting trade union structures to the reality of a specific industry (electronics and not the metallurgical industry, which remains the usual framework for negotiations), these committees have scarcely been effective. Furthermore, it was observed that there is a real asymmetry between the enterprise (strategic level where important decisions about employment are made) and the establishments. Within the latter, in spite of rights given to union organizations, they, as well as the local administrations which are sometimes just as powerless as themselves, can only negotiate the consequences of strategies elaborated at the group and enterprise levels. Thus one of the major limitations of the policy of decentralization of industrial relations can be clearly seen here. As regards the health care sector, its System of industrial relations is structured around a statutory logic regulating recruitment, remuneration and employment of permanent personnel. Since the hospital reforms of July 31, 1991, with a concern for democratization similar to the one which was behind the Auroux laws, dialogue between all actors can take place within a series of councils who are responsible for both investment programs and internal regulations, etc. The fact remains that in the case of electronics, decisions about the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> are made at the central level (the Ministry) : the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> is thus a fact that the actors cannot negotiate because it is the result of political arbitration and certain financial constraints. This weak union influence on determining factors of employment policy was one of the reasons, among many others, for the emergence of new forms of collective action during the second half of the 1980 s. During the conflicts that characterized this period, nurses and auxiliary nurses went beyond union and institutional channels of communication in aid of sectorial organizations. This was significant each time, the conflicts having a direct impact on topics that normally cannot be debated within the framework of joint committees: such is the case of the level of employment, re-establishment of indexation and recruitment terms. This is amply demonstrated in the two sectorial studies that were conducted. These two case studies tend to show that in France the movement towards decentralization not only increases the tendency to negotiate salary changes, management of work time, and so on in a compartmentalized way, but also makes it more difficult for union organizations to negotiate employment policy determinants at the enterprise level. Furthermore, beyond differences between the private and public sectors that many researchers have rightly emphasized, it appears to us that the two sectors examined continue to have certain common characteristics which reflect quite well the difficulty experienced by the current French trade union movement in adapting itself structurally to the new social and economic context...|$|E

40|$|The {{draft for}} a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base Directive in the European Union {{includes}} the suggestion for an apportionment formula which allocates taxable group profits to group member corporations. These allocated profits shall then be taxed in the respective Member States. The draft directive delegates {{the right to}} define one factor of the apportionment formula, the term "Employee" to the Member States, who are therefore free to choose a narrow or a broad definition, the latter including also atypical employment schemes. Using a game-theoretic approach the paper shows that the individually rational strategy of any Member State to define "Employee" broadly so as to maximize the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> the apportionment factor and thus maximize the allocated share of taxable income is only the best solution when tax rate differences and differences in the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> atypical <b>employment</b> schemes are disregarded. If such differentials and the corporate groups' reactions to different Member States' definitions are included in modelling the game's pay-offs a narrow definition of "Employee" yields the highest individual pay-offs to the Member States involved. This change of dominant strategies is triggered by the corporate group's shifting <b>of</b> the <b>employment</b> factor from high-tax to low-tax Member States. Our paper differs from previous research on the economic effects of the CCCTB apportionment formula {{as it is the}} first paper identifying and analysing the employment factor and its distorting effects. The paper discusses possible tax minimizing strategies for corporate groups by shifting workforce and develops a model to quantify these potential relocations. Furthermore the paper presents advice to policy makers in their "Employee" definition decision and shows how Member States could use this definition to both minimize outward factor shifting and maximize inward factor shifting.

40|$|By {{virtue of}} its complexity, {{realistic}} approaches to describe diffusion in cellular media require the <b>employment</b> <b>of</b> computational methods. Among others, this type of studies {{has shown that the}} apparent diffusion coefficient of a macromolecular solute through a cytoplasmic-like medium exhibits a power-law dependence with the excluded volume. Power laws are ubiquitous findings in diverse systems, such as metabolic processes, population dynamics, and communication networks, and have been the object of many interpretative formal approaches. This study introduces a diagrammatic algorithm, inspired in previous ones employed to analyze multicyclic chemical systems, to derive expressions for nonhomogeneous diffusion coefficients and to study the effects <b>of</b> <b>volume</b> exclusion. A most noteworthy result of this work is that midsize diagrams of nonhomogeneous diffusion are already able to exhibit an approximate power-law dependence of the diffusion coefficient with the excluded <b>volume.</b> The <b>employment</b> <b>of</b> the diagrammatic method for the analysis of simple situations may thus prove useful to interpret some properties of larger network systems...|$|R
