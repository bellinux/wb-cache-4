25|$|Trogons are cavity nesters. Nests are {{dug into}} rotting wood or termite nests, with one species, the <b>violaceous</b> <b>trogon,</b> nesting in wasp nests. Nest {{cavities}} {{can either be}} deep upward slanting tubes that lead to fully enclosed chambers, or much shallower open niches (from which the bird is visible). Nests are dug with the beak, incidentally giving the family its name. Nest digging may be undertaken by the male alone or by both sexes. In the case of nests dug into tree trunks, the wood must be strong enough not to collapse but soft enough to dig out. Trogons have been observed landing on dead tree trunks and slapping the wood with their tails, presumably to test the firmness.|$|E
50|$|The gartered trogon (Trogon caligatus), {{also known}} as the {{northern}} <b>violaceous</b> <b>trogon,</b> is a near passerine bird in the trogon family, Trogonidae. It is found in forests in east-central Mexico, south through Central America, to north-western South America (west or north of the Andes in Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela). It was formerly treated as a subspecies of the <b>violaceous</b> <b>trogon.</b>|$|E
50|$|For comparison, {{the similar}} but smaller <b>violaceous</b> <b>trogon</b> has a yellow (male) or {{incomplete}} white eye-ring (female), {{and the male}} also has barring to the undertail.|$|E
5000|$|The park covers 12,500 acres (5,058 ha) and two life zonesâ€”lower montane {{rainforest}} and pre-montane rainforest. These forests provide {{habitat for}} some 45 mammal species, including the Baird's tapir, kinkajou, white-faced capuchin monkey, paca, agouti, ocelet, and jaguarundi. The park's 400 bird species include sparrow hawks, resplendent quetzals, emerald toucanets, and <b>violaceous</b> <b>trogons.</b> There are 28 species of reptiles and amphibians, {{and a large}} insect population that includes the thysania agrippina, the largest moth on the American continent.|$|R
25|$|Prey {{is almost}} always {{obtained}} on the wing. The most commonly employed foraging technique is a sally-glean flight, where a trogon flies from an observation perch to a target on another branch or in foliage. Once there the birds hovers or stalls and snatches the item before returning to its perch to consume the item. This type of foraging is commonly used by some types of bird to obtain insect prey; in trogons and quetzals it {{is also used to}} pluck fruit from trees. Insect prey may also be taken on the wing, with the trogon pursuing flying insects in a similar manner to drongos and Old World flycatchers. Frogs, lizards and large insects on the ground may also be pounced on from the air. More rarely some trogons may shuffle along a branch to obtain insects, insect eggs and very occasionally nestling birds. <b>Violaceous</b> <b>trogons</b> will consume wasps and wasp larvae encountered while digging nests.|$|R
50|$|The {{shade of}} {{the blue of the}} head in the male differs between the <b>violaceous</b> <b>trogon</b> and the gartered trogon, but (disregarding their {{separate}} distributions) the voice is the main distinction between the two. The gartered has a slurred whistled cuh-cuh-cuh, and violaceous has a soft cow cow, cow.|$|E
50|$|Most trogons have {{distinctive}} {{male and}} female plumages, with soft, often colourful, feathers. The gartered trogon is a relatively small species at about 23 cm in length. The head and upper breast of the male are blue and the back is green, becoming bluer on the rump. A faint white line separates the breast from the orange-yellow underparts. The undertail is white with black barring, and the wings are black, vermiculated with white. The complete eye-ring is yellow. The female <b>violaceous</b> <b>trogon</b> resembles the male, but has a dark grey back, head and breast, and an incomplete white eye-ring.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{individuals}} to distinguish conspecifics from similar-looking congeners has important evolutionary consequences, yet few studies have determined which specific visual characteristics are used for species recognition, and whether closely related species use the same characteristics. In particular, sympatry with similar-looking congeners may influence which traits are important in species recognition. We presented elegant trogons, Trogon elegans, and black-headed trogons, Trogon melanocephalus, with models that closely resembled conspecifics and models that differed in either the colour of the belly, the colour of the upperparts or the tail-barring pattern, while broadcasting species-specific songs. Elegant trogons showed significantly more aggression towards the conspecific and tail models, suggesting that belly and back colour, but not tail-barring pattern, are important for species recognition in this species. In contrast, the black-headed trogon approached all models very closely, except for the conspecific model. We interpret this counterintuitive behaviour as reluctance to approach an unknown conspecific, suggesting that all three plumage traits are important for species recognition in black-headed trogons. Because the elegant trogon is not sympatric with a similar-looking congener, we argue that they may lack the ability to discriminate fine-barring tail differences or overlook this trait. Sympatry with the similar-looking <b>violaceous</b> <b>trogon</b> may have influenced species recognition in black-headed trogons, favouring the use of all three plumage characteristics, including tail-banding patterns, which differ between these species. Alternatively, {{it is possible that}} incongruent stimuli are attended to differently, with elegant trogons focusing on the acoustic traits and black-headed trogons focusing on visual cues. Nevertheless, our study provides the first experimental evidence that specific plumage patches are used for species recognition and that closely related species may use different traits for species recognition. Our findings also suggest that the presence of a similar-looking congener can influence which traits are important in species recognition...|$|E
