40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} the results of a study of the effect of <b>vacuum</b> <b>technologies</b> of formation of surface layers on pitting of associated elements in a lubricated, heavy-load rolling contact. Design/methodology/approach: Samples of 16 MnCr 5 vacuum-carburised steel, 100 Cr 6 bearing steel as well as elements of 100 Cr 6 steel with deposited coatings of titanium nitride (TiN) and chromium nitride (CrN) of various depths have been examined. The contact under examination was lubricated with RL 144 standard mineral oil with no additives. Findings: The study has shown that increase in a PVD coat depth is accompanied by decrease in the fatigue friction pair. Research limitations/implications: The elements after cutting-edge surface processing may have lower surface fatigue strength. It {{is one of the reasons}} for them not being used in lubricated friction parts of machines, especially high-performance ones. Originality/value: The study has shown a significant and varied effect on pitting of <b>vacuum</b> <b>technologies</b> of surface layer deposition in associated elements in concentrated rolling contac...|$|R

2500|$|De Forest's {{original}} {{device was}} made with conventional <b>vacuum</b> <b>technology.</b> The vacuum was not a [...] "hard vacuum" [...] but rather left a very small amount of residual gas. The physics behind the device's operation was also not settled. The residual gas would cause a blue glow (visible ionization) when the plate voltage was high (above about 60 volts). In 1912, De Forest brought the Audion to Harold Arnold in AT's engineering department. Arnold recommended that AT purchase the patent, and AT followed his recommendation. Arnold developed high-vacuum tubes which were tested {{in the summer of}} 1913 on AT's long distance network. The high-vacuum tubes could operate at high plate voltages without a blue glow.|$|E
