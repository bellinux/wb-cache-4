40|$|An autopsy case of {{malignant}} mesothelioma probably {{originated in the}} left pleura of a 77 -year-old man is presented. In this case {{the spread of the}} tumor was at first characterized by continuous extension to subserous connective, adipose and muscular tissues of the left parietal pleura, and to interlobar fissures and pulmonary septas of the left lung, and secondly by metastases to bifurcation lymph nodes, right pleura and lung, heart, thyroid, liver, pancreas etc. The tumor had a strong tendency to spread by contiguity and serosal seeding, and most of the metastatic nodules of the right lung, liver etc. were also recognized just beneath the serosa. Microscopically, the tumor had a characteristic cytoarchitecture that was papillomatous or 2 ̆ 2 <b>villous</b> <b>carcinoma</b> 2 ̆ 2 -like appearance in some areas and fibrosarcomatous in others. The tumor cells showed frequently phagocytic activities, i. e., erythro-, siderophagocytosis, anthracosis, hyaline droplet degeneration etc. and sometimes formation of giant cells. At times tumor cells demonstrating central pale areas of the cytoplasm and peripherally arranged nucleus were recognizable, permitting an impression of signet ring cells. Such cells, however, contained no substance tinctorial with mucicarmine or periodic acid-Schiff 2 ̆ 7 s stain. It may be worthy of note that the tumor cells had a potency to proliferate in various kinds of environments, that is, in the serous cavity (pleural cavity), in the intramural organ tissues (pulmonary septa and alveolar wall, heart, thyroid, liver, pancreas etc.), in the body fluid (blood and lymph vessels) and on the internal surface of the body (alveolar surface), and the cytoarchitecture of the tumor was, in general, epitheliomatous or carcinomatous in the superficial or central layers and sarcomatous in the deeper or peripheral zone. Such a case may offer an evidence of multipotentiality of mesothelial cells even in their neoplastic transformation...|$|E
40|$|A {{biomarker}} {{of increased}} risk for colon cancer is abnormally high proliferation of colonic epithelial cells. The authors developed an in vitro assay that measures the ability of human colonic epithelial cells that are in progressive stages of abnormal development to respond to direct application of calcium as the chloride in tissue culture medium. Incorporation of 3 H‐thymidine and autoradiography in situ was employed to measure the number of proliferating cells cultured at 0. 1 mM CaCl 2, the optimum level for growth, and 2. 2 to 5 mM, both levels achievable in the colonic lumen. Abnormal cell proliferation was reduced in biopsies from 13 of 14 patients without familial polyposis but at {{increased risk for}} colon cancer because of previous colonic neoplasms or familial association; in cells from three of four asymptomatic individuals in familial polyposis families at risk for that disease; and in cells of three of ten patients symptomatic with familial polyposis. Growth of tubular adenoma cells from two of seven familial polyposis patients was also inhibited by calcium. Growth inhibition was not observed in more advanced colon tumors including eight adenomas, either villotubular or <b>villous,</b> and five <b>carcinomas.</b> These findings indicate heterogeneity within the familial polyposis phenotype for the normal cellular response to growth inhibition by calcium, and a further loss of response to calcium as these cells progress toward malignancy.

40|$|A {{family history}} of {{colorectal}} cancer may increase colorectal cancer risk by influencing adenoma growth or enhancing the formation of new lesions. Data of men from the prospective Health Professionals Follow-Up Study who underwent an endoscopy between 1986 and 2004 were used to evaluate whether a {{family history of}} colorectal cancer is associated with adenoma multiplicity or advanced adenoma stage (>= 1 cm, histology with <b>villous</b> component or <b>carcinoma</b> in situ). 21. 4 % of the 3, 881 adenoma patients and 13. 9 % of the 24, 959 adenoma-free men had a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer. Thousand four hundred and ninety-six men were classified as having advanced and 1, 507 as having nonadvanced adenomas. Six hundred and twenty-two men had multiple and 1, 985 had single adenomas in the distal colon and rectum. A family history of colorectal cancer was similarly associated with advanced and nonadvanced adenomas [multivariable odds ratio (OR) (95 % confidence interval) : advanced vs. nonadvanced, 0. 98 (0. 82 - 1. 17), advanced vs. adenoma-free: 1. 67 (1. 47 - 1. 91), nonadvanced vs. adenoma-free: 1. 70 (1. 49 - 1. 94) ], although potential differences according to adenoma location were seen. A family history of colorectal cancer was more strongly associated with multiple distally located adenomas [odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) : multiple vs. single, 1. 35 (1. 09 - 1. 68), multiple vs. no distally located adenomas: 2. 02 (1. 67 - 2. 44), single vs. no distally located adenomas: 1. 49 (1. 32 - 1. 68) ]. The number of adenomas was also positively associated with {{a family history of}} colorectal cancer. Our findings suggest that at the population level, heritable factors may be more important in earlier stages of adenoma formation than at stages of adenoma advancement for at least distally located adenomas.

40|$|Background: Diet, {{lifestyle}} and heritable {{factors have been}} related to colorectal cancer risk; to date, their relevance to the overall scope of colorectal carcinogenesis, has not been clearly established. Aim and Methods: To evaluate whether distinguishing colorectal tissue by its histopathological and molecular characteristics sheds further light on the etiology of colorectal cancer. Five research questions addressed associations between diet, {{lifestyle and}} heritable factors, and specific tissue characteristics. Results: First, we observed that consumption of fruits, in particular citrus fruits, was associated with increased rectal glutathione S-transferase activity in a cross-sectional study of 94 Dutch individuals. Consumption of cruciferous vegetables was also associated with increased activity, but only among individuals who carried the GSTM 1 genotype. Second, we observed that intake of vitamin B 2 was inversely associated with adenomas with a K-ras mutation (n= 81) but not with adenomas without a K-ras mutation (n= 453) in a case-control study conducted in the Netherlands. A positive association with monounsaturated fat was confined to K-ras mutation-negative adenomas. We found indications for differential associations with some additional factors, but the epidemiological evidence on risk factors and K-ras mutations remains inconsistent. Third, in a cohort study of 26, 769 American men, we observed that most risk factors were similarly associated with advanced (= 1 cm or with any <b>villous</b> characteristics or <b>carcinoma</b> in situ) and non-advanced colorectal adenomas after 17 years of follow-up. However, smoking had a stronger positive association with advanced adenomas than with non-advanced adenomas, and ahigh glycemic index was inversely associated with advanced but not with non-advanced adenomas. Fourth, associations with family history of colorectal cancer were stronger for men with multiple distal adenomas than for men with a single distal adenoma at first diagnosis, in the aforementioned cohort study among US men. Associations between family history, and advanced and non-advanced adenomas, were of similar strength, but a tendency towards a somewhat stronger association with non-advanced adenomas was found. Fifth, fruit consumption was inversely associated with hMLH 1 protein-deficient colon cancer (n= 54) but not with hMLH 1 protein-proficient colon cancer (n= 387) in a cohort study of 120, 852 people who were followed-up over 7. 3 years, while ignoring information from the initial 2. 3 years of follow-up. Clear associations with consumption of vegetables, or nutrients related to fruits and vegetables, could not be detected. Conclusions: We showed that distinguishing colorectal tumors by their histopathological and molecular characteristics may indeed shed further light {{on the role of}} diet, lifestyle and heritable factors in colorectal carcinogenesis. Such an approach may alleviate some of the weaknesses of traditional epidemiology, but also adds another layer of complexity. It is a challenge for the future to develop a framework into which specific associations can be integrated, using risk markers signaling the molecular and biochemical pathways from normal to cancerous tissue...|$|R
