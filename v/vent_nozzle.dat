50|$|On June 2, 2006, Vinogradov {{performed}} {{his sixth}} career spacewalk. Vinogradov and NASA astronaut Jeffrey Williams spent six hours and 31 minutes making repairs and collecting experiments along the space station's exterior. Their excursion lasted {{almost an hour}} longer than planned after the astronauts fell behind in their work schedule. The two spacewalkers began their spacewalk at 22:48 GMT, when they stepped outside the Pirs docking compartment airlock. The spacewalking duo completed two key ISS repairs. Vinogradov replaced a clogged <b>vent</b> <b>nozzle</b> used to dump excess hydrogen overboard by the space station's Elektron oxygen generator. Vinogradov and Williams also replaced a broken video camera that provides key views from the space station's railcar-like Mobile Base System. During the spacewalk, Vinogradov watched a foot restraint adapter, which had previously linked him to the station's Strela crane, drift off into space. The spacewalk ended at 1:19 a.m. EDT when the two spacewalkers re-entered the airlock of the Pirs docking compartment.|$|E
40|$|The plume flowfield of a helium <b>vent</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{exhausting}} into {{a vacuum}} {{is defined by}} two techniques: the method of characteristics and the direct-simulation Monte Carlo method. The method of characteristics is shown to severely underpredict gas static temperatures due to the assumption of translational equilibrium inherent in the continuum formulation. Mass flow per unit solid angle is shown to be accurately predicted for this flowfield by the method of characteristics until the flow angle approaches within 10 deg of the maximum Prandtl-Meyer expansion angle. Improved treatment of the noncontinuum flow within the nozzle (near the lip) is postulated to have minor effects on the accuracy of this continuum method in comparison with translational nonequilibrium in the external flowfield. Possible treatment of translational nonequilibrium by the method of characteristics is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Static ground {{tests of}} a large scale lift/cruise thrust {{vectoring}} nozzle were conducted to establish: (1) vectoring performance 'in' and 'out' of ground effect; (2) thrust spoilage capability; (3) compatibility of the nozzle with a turbotip fan; and (4) the nozzle structural temperature distribution. Vectoring performance of a short coupled, <b>vented</b> <b>nozzle</b> design on a large scale, (60 %) basis was compared with small scale (4. 5 %) test nozzle results. The test nozzle was a "boilerplate" model of the MCAIR "D" <b>vented</b> <b>nozzle</b> configured for operation with the LF 336 /J 85 turbotip lift fan system. Calibration of the LF 336 /J 85 test fan with a simple convergent nozzle was performed with four different nozzle exit areas to establish reference thrust, nozzle pressure ratio, and nozzle corrected flow characteristics for comparison with the thrust vectoring nozzle data. Thrust vectoring tests with the 'D' <b>vented</b> <b>nozzle</b> were conducted over the range of vector angles between 0 and 117 deg for several different nozzle exit areas...|$|R

40|$|Future V/STOL {{aircraft}} {{will require}} efficient techniques {{for changing the}} thrust vector from the vertical direction for VTOL operation to the horizontal direction for conventional flight. Most V/STOL concepts utilize thrust vectoring nozzles to provide this variation in the thrust vector direction. An experimental test program was initiated to demonstrate the capabilities of a large scale 'D' vented thrust deflecting system coupled with a high bypass ratio turbofan engine. Data were obtained for a 'D' <b>vented</b> <b>nozzle</b> mounted behind a YTF- 34 -F 5 turbofan engine. Preliminary data are presented {{for a variety of}} test conditions. Attention is given to aspects of 'D' <b>vented</b> <b>nozzle</b> design, the test apparatus, engine-nozzle compatibility, exit area variation, longitudinal vectoring performance, nozzle temperature distribution, and large scale - small scale comparisons...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} were to: obtain nozzle performance characteristics {{in and out}} of ground effects; demonstrate the compatibility of the nozzle with a turbofan engine; obtain pressure and temperature distributions {{on the surface of the}} D vented nozzle; and establish a correlation of the nozzle performance between small scale and large scale models. The test nozzle was a boilerplate model of the MCAIR D <b>vented</b> <b>nozzle</b> configured for operation with a General Electric YTF- 34 -F 5 turbofan engine. The nozzle was configured to provide: a thrust vectoring range of 0 to 115 deg; a yaw vectoring range of 0 to 10 deg; variable nozzle area control; and variable spacing between the core exit and nozzle entrance station. Compatibility between the YTF- 34 -T 5 turbofan engine and the D <b>vented</b> <b>nozzle</b> was demonstrated. Velocity coefficients of 0. 96 and greater were obtained for 90 deg of thrust vectoring. The nozzle walls remained cool during all test conditions...|$|R

It is inspired by the Japanese national soccer team, with red 18-inch wheels with exclusive polygonal design, black interior equipment with contrasting stitching in blue, corresponding colour accents for air <b>vent</b> <b>nozzles,</b> inlays, center console and floor mats; sports suspension.

40|$|The {{influence}} of {{coefficients for the}} three axes of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) were established to determine the maximum allowable thrust {{difference between the two}} <b>vent</b> <b>nozzles</b> of the aperture cover tank low thrust vent system and their maximum misalignment. Test data generated by flow and torque measurements permitted the selection of two nozzles whose thrust differential was within the limit of the attitude control capability. Based on thrust stand data, a thrust vector misalignment was indicated that was slightly higher than permissible for the worst case, i. e., considerable degradation of the torque capacity of the attitude control system combined with venting of helium at its upper limit. The probability of destabilizing the IRAS spacecraft by activating the venting system appeared to be very low. The selection and mounting of the nozzles have satisfied all the requirements for the safe venting of helium...|$|R
40|$|A D <b>vented</b> thrust {{deflecting}} <b>nozzle</b> {{applicable to}} subsonic V/STOL aircraft was tested behind a simulated turbofan engine in the verticle thrust stand. Nozzle thrust, fan operating characteristics, nozzle entrance conditions, and static pressures were measured. Nozzle performance was measured for variations in exit area and thrust deflection angle. Six core nozzle configurations, {{the effect of}} core exit axial location, mismatched core and fan stream nozzle pressure ratios, and yaw vane presence were evaluated. Core nozzle configuration affected performance at normal and engine out operating conditions. Highest vectored nozzle performance resulted for a given exit area when core and fan stream pressure were equal. Its is concluded that high nozzle performance can be maintained at both normal and engine out conditions through control of the nozzle entrance Mach number with a variable exit area...|$|R
40|$|The Trieste {{outfall sewer}} system is active since 1992, {{discharging}} treated sewage {{at a distance}} of 7. 5 km offshore and average sea depth of 20 m. The submerged diffuser has a Y shape, being constituted of a 500 m long inlet pipe, 2 m in diameter, followed by two pipelines, 6 and 6. 5 km in length, each leading to the diffusers, 500 and 1000 m long, respectively. This system is efficient, provided full <b>nozzle</b> <b>venting.</b> This condition, however, is difficult to assess, both for difficulties in continuous monitoring and for possible nozzle occlusions. Moreover, risers are subject to damaging, leading to larger treated sewage fluxes and a lesser dilution efficiency. The aging of the pipe system is assessed in comparison with the “as new” and design conditions. Some site measurements of dilution characteristics give some hints on actual system efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The no-vent fill {{method is}} a {{promising}} approach {{to handle the}} problems of low-g venting during propellant transfer. A receiver tank is first cooled to remove thermal energy from the tank wall and the resultant vapor <b>vented</b> overboard. Then <b>nozzles</b> mix the incoming liquid and residual vapor in the tank maintaining a thermodynamic state which allows the tank to fill with liquid without venting. Ground based testing at NASA Lewis Research Center (LeRC) has demonstrated the no-vent fill process and attempted to bound its low-gravity performance. But, low-gravity testing is required to validate the method. As an alternative to using a dedicated spacecraft for validation the authors have formulated several small scale experiments to study no-vent fill in low-g. Cost goals quickly limited the search to two possibilities: a secondary payload on the Space Shuttle, or a small scale sounding rocket experiment. This paper will discuss the key issues of small scale experimentation and present a conceptual design of a sounding rocket experiment with liquid hydrogen for studying the fill process...|$|R
40|$|It is envisaged {{that the}} next {{generation}} of civil large turbofan engines will be designed for greater bypass ratios when compared to contemporary architectures. The underlying motivation is to reduce specific thrust and improve propulsive efficiency. Concurrently, the aerodynamic performance of the exhaust system is anticipated to {{play a key role in}} the success of future engine architectures. The transonic flow topology downstream of the bypass nozzle can be significantly influenced by the after-body geometry. This behavior is further complicated by the existence of the air-flow <b>vent</b> on the <b>nozzle</b> after-body which can have an impact on the performance of the exhaust system. This paper aims to investigate the aerodynamics associated with the geometry of the bypass nozzle after-body and to establish guidelines for the design of separate-jet exhausts with respect to future large turbofan engines. A parametric geometry definition has been derived based on Class-Shape Transformation (CST) functions for the representation of post-nozzle-exit components such as after-bodies, plugs, and air-flow vents. The developed method has been coupled with an automatic mesh generation and a Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) flow solution method, thus devising an integrated aerodynamic design tool. A cost-effective optimization strategy has been implemented consisting of methods for Design Space Exploration (DSE), Response Surface Modeling (RSM), and Genetic Algorithms (GAs). The combined approach has been deployed to explore the aerodynamic design space associated with the bypass nozzle after-body geometry for a Very High Bypass Ratio (VHBR) turbofan engine with separate-jet exhausts. A detailed investigation has been carried out to expose the transonic flow mechanisms associated with the effect of after-body curvature combined with the impact of the air-flow vent. A set of optimum curved after-body geometries has been obtained, with each subsequently compared against their respective conical representation. The obtained results suggest that no significant performance improvements can be obtained through curving the nozzle after-body relative to the case of a conical design. However, it is shown that the application of surface curvature has the potential to unlock new parts in the design space that allow analysts to reduce the required after-body length without any loss in aerodynamic performance. The developed approach complements the existing tool-set of enabling technologies for the design and optimization of future large aero-engines, consequently leading to increased thrust and reduced Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) ...|$|R
40|$|In Envac AB's {{automatic}} {{waste collection}} systems the air enters the pipe systems through air <b>vents</b> containing a <b>nozzle.</b> Unfortunately this air vent, {{and especially the}} nozzle, generates disturbing noise. This has as a consequence that silencers have been built which in turn leads to higher production costs and larger facilities for the air vents. The aim of the present work has been to evaluate a simulation method for studying these air vents and to use this method to analyze the generation of sound in the air inlet vents. The method studied in this thesis work {{is based on the}} simple idea that the experienced sound can be reduced by minimizing the sources of sound generation. The aeroacoustic sources represent the unsteady phenomena in the flow which creates the sound. The advantage of this method is that sound sources such as the Lilley and Linear Euler Equation sources can be calculated from a steady RANS solution. Compared to resolving the pressure fluctuations with an unsteady simulations this is a computationally less demanding method. In order to validate the proposed method CFD simulations has been performed. The first set of simulations is RANS calculations on round jets with different inlet velocities. The comparison between changes in calculated sound sources and theoretically derived changes in sound level [Ref 11] shows that a relationship exists between the predicted level of aeroacoustc sources and the theoretically generated sound. After this relation has been established simulations were performed on two test cases where the first one is a backward facing step and the second one is a similar geometry but with a bend before the step. These geometries are suitable for the present work because they include the same type of flow phenomena as the real air vent. Both unsteady LES and steady RANS calculations were performed in order to evaluate both turbulence models and aeroacoustic sources. The accuracy of the calculations on the backward-facing step has been validated through comparison with DNS data [Ref 9]. The simulations have given good results both in terms of recommending a turbulence model for geometries similar to the two test cases and in terms of evaluating the aeroacoustic method. It was shown that the k- SST model is the most suitable turbulence model for the two test cases and that the integral of Lilly's source term, the Linear Euler Equation source term and the Acoustic Power in the domain are good parameters to use when trying to minimize the generated sound...|$|R
