25|$|The {{aircraft}} departed Monto a {{few minutes}} after 11:00 on a direct track towards Caboolture carrying the pilot and five non-paying passengers. The weather for the flight was expected to be VFR (<b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules)</b> <b>conditions</b> with good visibility, high clouds and light winds. At 13:15, the aircraft contacted air traffic control, reporting an approximate position 69km north of Caboolture and requesting assistance with navigation. Shortly after, the pilot issued a distress call as the aircraft had entered thick cloud. Controllers in Brisbane then communicated positional information to the aircraft directly and relayed via other pilots in the area due to difficulties with radio reception. A friend of one of the passengers aboard Riama {{received a phone call from}} the aircraft, reporting that they were lost in cloud and unable to maintain altitude at around 13:20. Over the next hour, witnesses in the area around the crash site reported seeing the aircraft flying in and out of cloud at low level. At 13:48, the pilot reported he had one hour of fuel remaining and the last transmission from the aircraft came at 14:04. Neither the aircraft or the pilot were equipped or certified to fly without visual reference to the ground.|$|E
50|$|Simultaneous {{opposite}} direction parallel runway operations, or SODPROPS, {{is a method}} of coordinating the arrival and departure of aircraft on parallel runways. Airports that have two parallel runways can use this method so that aircraft can arrive on one runway while another aircraft can depart simultaneously in the {{opposite direction}} on the parallel runway. For example, an aircraft can depart runway 09R while another aircraft lands on runway 27R. This potentially maximizes the efficient coordination of aircraft in certain weather conditions as well as aiding in noise abatement. Currently this traffic control method is only practicable in <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E
50|$|The SW-4 {{is powered}} by a single 335 kW (450 shp) (283 kW/380 shp max {{continuous}} rated) Rolls-Royce Model 250C20R/2 turboshaft engine, which drives the rotorcraft's three-blade main rotor and two-blade tail rotor. An alternative engine is provided {{in the form of the}} 460 kW (615 shp) Pratt & Whitney Canada PW200/9 turboshaft engine. The main rotor is fully articulated and the rotor blades on both the main and tail rotors are composed of composite materials. The SW-4 uses hydraulic flight controls, the rotorcraft has been promoted as possessing excellent flight controls, and can be flown in both day and night <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E
50|$|Both {{aircraft}} {{were operating}} under Federal Aviation Regulation Part 91 without <b>flight</b> plans during <b>Visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (VFR) <b>conditions.</b> At {{the time of}} the accident visibility was 10 miles with a temperature of 33 degrees (F) and the wind 220 degrees at 17 knots.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of the incident, the weather {{satisfied}} the <b>Visual</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Rules</b> (VFR) <b>conditions.</b> Based on review of training records, all crewmembers had the sufficient training, experience and skill to handle in-flight emergencies related to flight control. Moreover, all crewmembers were cleared of all medical conditions or medications which could have caused this mishap.|$|R
50|$|Naini Saini Airport also Known as Pithoragarh Airstrip {{is located}} in Pithoragarh, Uttarakhand, India. The {{airstrip}} was constructed in 1991 for administrative use and planned for the operations of Dornier 228 type aircraft. The State Government plans to upgrade it to Category 2C airport under <b>Visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (VFR) <b>conditions</b> to facilitate operations of ATR-42 type of aircraft.|$|R

50|$|The Air Race Classic is {{an annual}} transcontinental air race for female pilots. Route lengths are {{approximately}} 2400 smi km. All flights are conducted in day <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (VFR) <b>conditions.</b> Each aircraft is handicapped for speed and engine power.

40|$|The {{results are}} {{reported}} of acoustic measurements {{made on the}} 747 aircraft during visual approach monitor evaluation approaches. This display is designed to improve approach and landing precision under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> <b>conditions.</b> The purpose of the acoustic portion of the test was to measure, evaluate, and identify the noise levels during various types of aircraft approaches. Six noise measurement sites were positioned on the centerline of the approach ground track. The six noise measurement stations on the approach ground track were positioned between approximately 1 and 6 nautical miles from runway threshold. The 1 -nautical mile point {{was chosen as the}} beginning of the ground track because it is specified as the approach measurement point in the FAA noise certification requirements. The 6 -nautical mile point was chosen for its proximity {{to the point where the}} approach is initiated...|$|R
50|$|If {{the radio}} failure occurs in <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (VFR) <b>conditions</b> {{in an area}} where radio {{communication}} is required, the pilot is expected to continue under VFR and land when feasible. If flying under instrument <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (IFR) <b>conditions,</b> and VFR conditions exist or are encountered after the failure, the flight should be continued in VFR conditions and the pilot shall land as soon as practicable. If VFR conditions do not exist, the pilot will then continue the route last assigned by ATC. See FAR 91.185.|$|R
50|$|The Pennsylvania Bureau of Aviation classifies the Flying Dollar Airport as {{a public}} basic utility airport {{suitable}} for operations in daytime <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (VFR) <b>conditions.</b> Its runway is considered moderately challenging due to a 4.5% gradient. The southern threshold of the runway is 1,322 feet MSL while the northern threshold is 1,430 feet MSL and abuts trees that are 94 feet high. Due to these conditions, landings on runway 20 and takeoffs on runway 02 are both prohibited.|$|R
50|$|The An-148 {{aircraft}} is a high-wing monoplane {{with two}} turbofan jet engines mounted in pods under the wing. This arrangement protects the engines and wing structure against damage from foreign objects (FOD). A built-in auto-diagnosis system, auxiliary power unit, high reliability, and the wing configuration allow the An-148 {{to be used}} at poorly equipped airfields. Modern flight and navigation equipment, featuring five 15 by 20 cm liquid crystal display (LCD) panels built by Russiaâ€™s Aviapribor and a fly-by-wire system enable the An-148 aircraft to operate day and night, under instrument <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (IFR) and <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (VFR) weather <b>conditions</b> on high density air routes. Similar to the Boeing 737, the main landing gear rotates into {{the belly of the}} aircraft when in flight, with partial doors covering the legs, and the sides of the tires remaining exposed. Other design advantages include the high fuel-efficiency of the Motor Sich D-436-148 engines and entrance stairs that enable boarding and deboarding the aircraft without extra ground equipment.|$|R
