5|$|Cumulus humilis clouds usually {{indicate}} fair weather. Cumulus mediocris {{clouds are}} similar, {{except that they}} have some <b>vertical</b> <b>development,</b> which implies that they can grow into cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Cumulus congestus clouds, which appear as towers, will often grow into cumulonimbus storm clouds. They can produce precipitation. Glider pilots often {{pay close attention to}} cumulus clouds, as they can be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the skya phenomenon known as cloud suck.|$|E
25|$|More general airmass {{instability}} in the troposphere tends to produce clouds of the more freely convective cumulus genus type, whose species are mainly indicators of degrees of atmospheric instability and resultant <b>vertical</b> <b>development</b> of the clouds.

25|$|When the {{precipitation}} {{reaches the}} ground without completely evaporating, it is {{designated as the}} feature praecipitatio. This normally occurs with altostratus opacus, which can produce widespread but usually light precipitation, and with thicker clouds that show significant <b>vertical</b> <b>development.</b> Of the latter, upward-growing cumulus mediocris produces only isolated light showers, while downward growing nimbostratus is capable of heavier, more extensive precipitation. Towering vertical clouds have the greatest ability to produce intense precipitation events, but these tend to be localized unless organized along fast-moving cold fronts. Showers of moderate to heavy intensity can fall from cumulus congestus clouds. Cumulonimbus, the largest of all cloud genera, {{has the capacity to}} produce very heavy showers. Low stratus clouds usually produce only light precipitation, but this always occurs as the feature praecipitatio due to the fact this cloud genus lies too close to the ground to allow for the formation of virga.|$|E

500|$|Above {{or below}} the circle for manned {{stations}} (automatic stations do not report cloud types) that indicates sky cover can lie one or more symbols indicating cloud types {{in any of the}} low, middle, and high-étages for tropospheric clouds. One predominant cloud type may be depicted for each of three étages, if known. The middle and high-étage types are depicted above the sky cover circle of the station model, while the main low-étage cloud type is indicated below the circle. Since the station model has limited room, it makes no special provision for vertical or multi-level clouds that can occupy more than one étage at a particular time. [...] Consequently, cloud genera with significant <b>vertical</b> <b>development</b> may be coded and plotted as low or middle depending on the altitude at which they normally form. Cumulus and cumulonimbus usually form in the low étage of the troposphere and achieve vertical extent by growing upward into the middle or high étage. Conversely, nimbostratus usually forms in the middle étage of the troposphere and becomes vertically developed by growing downward into the low étage. [...] Although the SYNOP code has no separate formal group classification for vertical or multi-level clouds, the observer procedure for selecting numerical codes is designed to give high reporting priority to those genera or species that show significant <b>vertical</b> <b>development.</b>|$|E

Cumulus humilis clouds look like puffy, flattened shapes. Cumulus mediocris clouds look similar, except that they have some <b>vertical</b> <b>development.</b> Cumulus congestus clouds have a cauliflower-like structure and tower high into the atmosphere, hence their alternate name [...] "towering cumulus".

40|$|Abstract. By using parcel model {{theory to}} {{construct}} a two-dimensional parameter space formed by low-level atmospheric stability and moisture, a simple framework on which to examine certain fire parcel properties associated with <b>vertical</b> column <b>development</b> is established. This framework is used to investigate if the Haines Index has some skill at predicting wildfire severity, where wildfire severity {{is assumed to be}} directly connected to <b>vertical</b> column <b>development</b> and the result of significant fire parcel ascent. By modeling the ascent of a moist, entraining fire parcel in four different background states—a 3 km deep boundary layer, a 2 km deep boundary layer, a 3 km deep boundary layer topped by an inversion layer, and a 2 km deep boundary layer topped by an inversion layer—the study shows that parcel properties that describe ascent and <b>vertical</b> column <b>development</b> are most significant when the boundary layer temperature lapse rate is near adiabatic and lower-level atmospheric humidity is relatively high. A shallower instead of a deeper boundary layer lowers parcel ascent, and an upper-level inversion lowers parcel ascent even further. This study shows that entraining fire parcel properties and magnitudes associated with significant ascent do not necessarily correspond to a Haines Index for a potential for high fire severity. The results suggest that the Haines Index may need to be refined or reformed depending on the stability and humidity in the boundary layer and vertical structure of the atmosphere. This study is a start to understanding the influence of the background state on fire parcel convection and an attempt to explain how the Haines Index works from an elementary but physical point of view...|$|R
500|$|Warm air {{has a lower}} density than cool air, so warmer air rises upwards and cooler air {{will settle}} at the bottom (this effect can be seen with a hot air balloon). Clouds form as {{relatively}} warmer air, carrying moisture, rises within cooler air. The moist air rises, and, as it does so, it cools {{and some of the}} water vapor in that rising air condenses. When the moisture condenses, it releases energy known as latent heat of vaporization, which allows the rising packet of air to cool less than the cooler surrounding air continuing the cloud's ascension. If enough instability is present in the atmosphere, this process will continue long enough for cumulonimbus clouds to form and produce lightning and thunder. Meteorological indices such as convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the lifted index can be used to assist in determining potential upward <b>vertical</b> <b>development</b> of clouds.

Nimbostratus normally forms from mid-level altostratus, and develops at least moderate vertical extent when the base subsides into {{the low level}} during precipitation that can reach moderate to heavy intensity. [...] It commonly achieves deep <b>vertical</b> <b>development</b> when it simultaneously grows upward into the high level due to large scale frontal or cyclonic lift.

[...] Meteorologists affiliated with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) officially classify nimbostratus as mid-level for synoptic purposes while informally characterizing it as multi-level.

The storage sites must be understood in detail to ensure safe storage on a millennial time scale. Outcrop analogs have been studied in order to enhance the understanding of the subsurface in regards of reservoir properties, sand body connectivity and <b>vertical</b> <b>developments.</b> An exhumed paleo-reservoir in Utah, Humbug Flats, is of special interest as it shows evidence for CO 2 accumulation and leakage through bleaching of the outcrop. This paleo-reservoir can therefore be used as an analog to potential locations for CO 2 storage. The main objective of this thesis is to compile and systemize data from previous studies in the area of the outcrop collected by the COPASS project. Issues related to acquisition and merging of multi-source collected outcrop data are identified and described. Facies associations have been mapped in 3 D by the use of Lidar images and sedimentary logs. A modelling workflow is developed for RMSTM (reservoir modelling program), implementing available data into one coherent geo-model. Problems related to merging of multi-source datasets, input data quality and model implementation are identified and addressed.
