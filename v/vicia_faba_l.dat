40|$|Faba beans (<b>Vicia</b> <b>faba</b> <b>L.)</b> are an {{excellent}} protein source and should be more present in human diet, but due to their long cooking time, they are rarely used. So, {{in order to increase}} the accessibility of faba beans (<b>Vicia</b> <b>faba</b> <b>L.),</b> experiments were carried out to obtain new food products. Extrusion-cooking was chosen as the potential thermal cooking process and two different products were obtained. One was made exclusively from faba bean (<b>Vicia</b> <b>faba</b> <b>L.)</b> flour, while the second one was produced with a 50 % addition of wheat flour to bean flour. Protein content, size, volume mass, pH and starch content for obtained products were analysed in order to characterise the products, as well as to see the differences from non-extruded faba beans (<b>Vicia</b> <b>faba</b> <b>L.)</b> and obtained samples. The experiments were carried out using faba beans (<b>Vicia</b> <b>faba</b> <b>L.)</b> obtained at Ltd. “Pure Horticultural Research Centre”. They were milled at Ltd. “Grauda spēks” and extruded with a twin screw extruder at Ltd. “Milzu”. The experiments showed that the extrusion process had decreased the protein content by 9 %, but the starch content had risen by 13 % with the addition of wheat flour. But, for sample, without added wheat flour differences were not significant. No significant size differences were observed in the obtained samples and pH values had no significant differences between extruded samples...|$|E

Different types of meiotic abnormalities such as stickiness, univalents, multivalents, unorientation of chromosomes, precocious separation of chromosomes at metaphase, bridges, laggards and unequal separation of chromosomes at anaphase were recorded. In general, the meiotic abnormalities in both the varieties increased along with the increase in concentration of mutagen.

40|$|Mixed {{intercropping}} {{of spring}} barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) with field pea (Pisum sativum <b>L.),</b> <b>faba</b> bean (<b>Vicia</b> <b>faba</b> var. minor <b>L.)</b> or narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) {{was compared to}} sole cropping in two field experiments at different locations, on a sandy loam soil and a sandy soil, in Denmark in 2001. Grain legumes were dominant in intercrops on the sandy loam soil, except for lupin, whereas barley was dominant in intercrops on the sandy soil site. Combined intercrop grain yields were comparable to grain yields of the respective sole cropped grain legume or sole cropped, fertilized barley on each soil site. On the sandy loam soil, pea-barley and faba bean-barley intercrops increased the proportion of plant N derived from N 2 fixation in grain legumes and increased the barley grain N concentration (1. 7 – 2. 2 mg/g) compared to sole cropping. However, the later maturity of faba bean compared to barley caused problems at harvest. The grain N concentration of intercropped barley was increased where grain legumes were dominant intercrops {{and not on the}} sandy soil site. Lupin-barley intercrops did not show intercropping advantages to the same degree as faba bean and pea, but lupin constituted a more stable yield proportion of the combined intercrop yield over locations. Furthermore, the study indicates that the natural level of 15 N abundance at certain locations might not always be sufficient to ensure a reliable estimate of N 2 fixation using the 15 N natural abundance method. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop recipient system of faba bean cultivars (<b>Vicia</b> <b>faba</b> <b>L.)</b> and to obtain 686 Sudan; 1059 Morocco; NEB 367; ILB 752; 724 Norway; 1083 Australia; Wasa soramame and Cairo 241 plants through direct regeneration in vitro. The morphogenetic of seeds in selected faba bean cultivars (<b>Vicia</b> <b>faba</b> <b>L.)</b> was realized via one way: direct regeneration of plants from mature cotyledons. The cotyledons with ten combinations of growth regulators: (Kin. : 6 -Furfurylaminopurine N 6 -Furfuryladenine C 10 H 9 N 5 O; BAP: 6 -Benzylamino- 9 -(2 -tetrahydropyranyl) - 9 H-purine C 17 H 19 N 5 O; TDZ: N-phenyl-N`- 1, 2, 3 -thiadiazol- 5 -ylurea; NAA: α-Naphthaleneacetic acid 1 -Naphthylacetic acid C 12 H 10 O 2 and IBA 4 -(3 -Indolyl) butanoic acid C 12 H 13 NO 2) were compared.

40|$|AbstractThe present investigation, the {{antimutagenic}} {{potential of}} Origanum majorana was evaluated in <b>Vicia</b> <b>faba</b> root meristematic cells. The root tip cells of <b>Vicia</b> <b>faba</b> {{were treated with}} sodium azide at 250 and 350 μg/ml for 6 h and Origanum majorana was given at 50, 100 and 200 μg/ml for 20 h, prior to sodium azide treatment. The tips were squashed after colchicine treatment and the cells were analyzed for chromosome aberration and mitotic index. Origanum majorana induces chromosomal aberration in <b>Vicia</b> <b>faba</b> root tip cells in an insignificant manner, when compared with untreated control. Sodium azide alone induces chromosomal aberrations significantly with increasing concentrations. The total number of aberrations was significantly reduced in root tip cells pretreated with Origanum majorana. This study revealed that Origanum majorana has antimutagenic potential against sodium azide induced chromosomal aberrations in <b>Vicia</b> <b>faba</b> root meristematic cells. In addition, it showed mild cytotoxicity by reducing the percentage of mitotic index in all O. majorana treated groups, The antimutagenic potential of Origanum majorana is effective at 50 μg/ml in <b>Vicia</b> <b>faba</b> root meristematic cells...|$|R

The present study investigates N dynamics in the soil and the yield of a tomato crop in Southern Italy as affected by green manure applied as horse bean (<b>Vicia</b> <b>faba</b> var. minor <b>L.)</b> in comparison with mineral fertilization. Trials were carried out {{during the summer of}} 2002 in Southern Italy. A split plot design was used, with green manure vs. uncultivated as the main factor and three levels of mineral N fertilization (0, 90 and 180 kg ha- 1 of N) as the sub-factor. The analysis of tomato yield showed a significant interaction between green manure and mineral fertilization. Yields gained after green manure or mineral fertilization were not significantly different. Mineral fertilization increased yields up to 90 kg ha- 1, suggesting that the maximum yield could be reached with lower N supplies than those normally used in the area. N balances for both the mineral and organic fertilization systems show N surpluses which are mainly determined by mineral N in the former.
