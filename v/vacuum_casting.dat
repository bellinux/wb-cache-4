50|$|Vacuum {{metallurgy}} is {{that field}} of materials technology {{that deals with}} making, shaping, or treating metals in a controlled atmosphere, at pressures significantly less than normal atmospheric pressure. The purpose of vacuum metallurgy is to prevent contamination of metal by gases in the atmosphere. Alternatively, in some processes, a reactive gas may be introduced into the process {{to become part of}} the resultant product. Examples of vacuum metallurgy include vacuum degassing of molten steel in steelmaking operations, vacuum deposition of thin metal layers in manufacture of optics and semiconductors, <b>vacuum</b> <b>casting,</b> vacuum arc remelting of alloys, and vacuum induction melting.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum filling, {{also known}} as counter-gravity filling, is more metal {{efficient}} than gravity pouring because less material solidifies in the gating system. Gravity pouring only has a 15 to 50% metal yield as compared to 60 to 95% for vacuum pouring. There is also less turbulence, so the gating system can be simplified since {{it does not have}} to control turbulence. Plus, because the metal is drawn from below the top of the pool the metal is free from dross and slag, as these are lower density (lighter) and float {{to the top of the}} pool. The pressure differential helps the metal flow into every intricacy of the mold. Finally, lower temperatures can be used, which improves the grain structure.

A wax model is obtained either from injection into a rubber mould or by being custom-made by carving. The wax or waxes are sprued and fused onto a rubber base, called a [...] "sprue base". Then a metal flask, which resembles a short length of steel pipe that ranges roughly from 1.5 to six {{inches tall and}} wide, is put over the sprue base and the waxes. Most sprue bases have a circular rim which grips the standard-sized flask, holding it in place. Investment (refractory plaster) is mixed and poured into the flask, filling it.

The bi-component mixture injected into the mold has a much lower viscosity than molten thermoplastic polymers, therefore large, light-weight, and thin-walled items can be successfully RIM processed. This thinner mixture also requires less clamping forces, which leads to smaller equipment and ultimately lower capital expenditures. Another advantage of RIM processed foam is that a high-density skin is formed with a low-density core.|$|R
50|$|Centrifugal casting, or centrifuging, {{is used as}} a {{means of}} casting small, {{detailed}} parts or jewelry. An articulated arm is free to spin around a vertical axle, which is driven by an electric motor or a spring. The entire mechanism is enclosed in a tub or drum to contain hot metal should the mold break or an excess of metal be used. Single use molds are prepared using the lost wax method. A small amount of metal in a crucible (a sort of ceramic pan) next to the mold is heated with a torch. When the metal is molten the arm is released, forcing (by centrifugal force) the metal into the mold. The high forces imposed on the metal overcome the viscosity, resulting in a finely detailed workpiece. A similar advantage may be obtained by <b>vacuum</b> <b>casting</b> or pressure casting.|$|E
