40|$|In {{the complex}} {{hydrocarbon}} mixture in urban air, the alkenes and arenes {{are of particular}} interest with respect to impact on health and environment. Knowledge of hydrocarbon concentrations in urban air {{is essential for the}} assessment and prevention of health hazards and photochemical oxidant formation. Hydrocarbons in urban air were sampled on specially made triple-layer adsorbent cartridges. Easily carried equipment was used for the sampling. After thermal desorption, the hydrocarbons were analyzed by gas chromatography. An aluminium oxide column effected the separation of C 2 -C 6 alkenes. Detection was generally by flame ionization but optional photoionization detection was found to be advantageous for the selective detection of alkenes and alkadienes in the C 3 -C 5 region. A recently introduced technique based on differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) was compared with the gas chromatographic method for the determination of benzene and toluene in air. Proportions and exposure levels of hazardous hydrocarbons were determined in urban air. Ethene, propene, 1, 3 -butadiene and benzene made up approximately 5, 2, 0. 5 and 6 per cent by weight of non-methane hydrocarbons. The composition was different for cold-start and high-speed emissions. Among the four isomeric butenes, the 2 -butenes were prominent in <b>petrol</b> <b>vapour</b> and methylpropene in exhaust.

40|$|Petrol station attendants’ {{exposure}} to gasoline vapours while refuelling vehicles has raised health concerns, especially in tropical countries like Saudi Arabia. This {{is due to}} the increase of gasoline vaporisation by the high temperatures and related weather conditions. This represents an increase risk of inhaling more vapours than its counterpart temperate countries. Furthermore, exposure during extended working hours (12 hrs shifts), with no vapour recovery system and the handling of gasoline containing a high percentage of volumes of toxic substances (e. g. BTEXs) have not been adequately addressed previously in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, this study was designed and carried out to investigate the validity of this concern by assessing and quantifying full shift exposures to gasoline <b>vapours</b> during the <b>petrol</b> filling process. Different exposure assessment methodologies were employed and evaluated for their suitability. The study assessed the exposures of 41 attendants via passive, active, and direct reading methods at twelve petrol stations with both high and low sales in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The study was conducted during the winter and summer months to test the seasonal variation of the pattern of exposure. The effects of the quantity of gasoline sold, the locations of the stations, weather variations (e. g. wind speed, temperature, and humidity) were tested. A purpose built mini-weather stations and modified thermometres were utilized to accurately monitor the prevailing weather conditions. Forward-looking infrared (FLIR) thermal image cameras were utilised to visualise the size and movement behaviour of the <b>vapour</b> plumes during <b>petrol</b> refuelling. Furthermore, analytical lab trials were carried out to characterise the gasoline vapour component under different temperatures. These were used to propose a new OEL.
