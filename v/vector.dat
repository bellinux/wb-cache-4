Disturbances to an unstable, nonlinear wave-mean oscillation are analyzed, allowing {{the comparison of}} singular <b>vectors</b> and time-dependent normal modes (Floquet <b>vectors).</b> Singular <b>vectors</b> characterize the transient growth of linear disturbances in a specified inner product over a specified time interval and, as such, they complement and are related to Lyapunov <b>vectors,</b> which characterize the asymptotic growth of linear disturbances. The relationship between singular <b>vectors</b> and Floquet <b>vectors</b> (the analog of Lyapunov <b>vectors</b> for time-periodic systems) is analyzed {{in the context of}} a nonlinear baroclinic wave-mean oscillation. It is found that the singular <b>vectors</b> divide into two dynamical classes that are related to those of the Floquet <b>vectors.</b> Singular <b>vectors</b> in the “wave dynamical” class are found to asymptotically approach constant linear combinations of Floquet <b>vectors.</b> The most rapidly decaying singular <b>vectors</b> project strongly onto the most rapidly decaying Floquet <b>vectors.</b> In contrast, the leading singular <b>vectors</b> project strongly onto the leading adjoint Floquet <b>vectors.</b> Examination of trajectories that are near the basic cycle show that the leading Floquet <b>vectors</b> are geometrically tangent to the local attractor while the leading initial singular <b>vectors</b> point off the local attractor.
