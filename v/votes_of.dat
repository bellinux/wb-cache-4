5|$|Cardinal Rodrigo Borja {{was elected}} {{unanimously}} on the 4th ballot as Pope Alexander VI. The election is notorious for allegations that Borja bought the <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> his electors, promising them lucrative appointments and other material gifts—a practice known as simony. Concerns about this conclave led Pope Julius II to create stronger rules against simony in 1503.|$|E

40|$|Constructive <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no-confidence {{as a tool}} to {{strengthen}} government position vis-à-vis parliament. The article seeks to analyze constructive <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no-confidence in constitutions and political practice of a selected set of countries.

This comparative analysis serves as a context in which a government bill intended to introduce a constructive <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no-confidence to the constitution of the Czech Republic is assessed.

5|$|Baronius {{came within}} 9 <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> election, with 32 of the electors {{supporting}} him, {{but he refused}} to advocate his own election or accept election by acclamation. Aldobrandini was unable to convince some members of his faction to vote for Baronius because they viewed him as too strict, and by 30 March he had resigned himself to look for other candidates.|$|E
5|$|Bresnahan {{was elected}} to the Hall of Fame the year after his death. He had {{received}} 47 <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> the 226 electors in the 1936 Hall of Fame balloting, and between 43 and 67 votes each time from 1937 through 1942. In the 1945 balloting, occurring one month after Bresnahan's death, he received 133 votes, still falling short of enshrinement. However, the Permanent Committee noticed the surge in votes and elected him in April 1945.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s Whitlam {{was seen as}} a {{leadership}} contender once the existing Labor leaders exited the scene. Most of the party's major figures, including Evatt, Deputy Leader Arthur Calwell, Eddie Ward, and Reg Pollard, were in their sixties, twenty years older than Whitlam. In 1960, after losing three elections, Evatt resigned and was replaced by Calwell, with Whitlam defeating Ward for deputy leader. Calwell came within a handful of <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> winning the cliffhanger 1961 election. He had not wanted Whitlam as deputy leader, and believed Labor would have won if Ward had been in the position.|$|E

Her largest primary vote was 43.7 percent in 1991, while her largest two-candidate preferred vote was 64.7 percent in 2003. The seat became Sydney at the 2007 state election, where Moore retained the seat with a primary <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> 39.6 percent (+7.2) and a two-candidate preferred <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> 66.6 percent (+1.6) against Labor.

5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} {{its way through the}} {{ratification}} process, Republicans in Congress grew increasingly concerned about the potential for there to be a large increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E
5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This {{is the result of}} a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E
5|$|Four years earlier, in the {{election}} of 1876, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio defeated Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York {{in one of the}} most hotly contested presidential elections in the nation's history. The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> several states were disputed until just a few days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes.|$|E
25|$|The Senate {{represents}} territorial institutions. It {{shares the}} legislative {{power with the}} Chamber of Deputies, but the <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> the Senate is only required to enact laws regarding specific matters.

5|$|Harrison placed fifth on {{the first}} ballot, with Sherman in the lead, and the next few ballots showed little change. The Blaine {{supporters}} shifted their support among candidates they found acceptable, and when they shifted to Harrison, they found a candidate who could attract the <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> many other delegations. He was nominated as the party's presidential candidate on the eighth ballot, by a count of 544 to 108 votes. Levi P. Morton of New York was chosen as his running mate.|$|E

5|$|In the 2012 presidential election, Republican nominee Mitt Romney earned over 50% of {{the vote}} in the precinct that {{included}} Trump Tower, one of two Manhattan voting precincts to do so (the other being the precinct that included the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel). However, although Trump received 23 votes in the district during the 2016 Republican primary, signifying the most <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> any Republican candidate there, there were 67 votes for his opponent Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary. In 2016, within the precinct that contained Trump Tower, 200 people voted for Clinton as opposed to 95 for Trump.|$|E
5|$|In the 75th Elder election, {{there are}} four finalists; Hatsune Minase hands over her votes to Kaoruko and Makiyo Shingyouji hands over her votes to Chihaya.

Though a {{candidate}} which gains 75% {{or more of the}} votes becomes the Elder, Hatsune, as the student council president, proposes that both Chihaya and Kaoruko become the Elders; the motion is adopted unanimously. This is the first time there have been two Elders in the history of Seio Girls' Academy.|$|E

5|$|Later that month, the Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} in Cincinnati, Ohio. Six men were officially candidates for nomination at the convention, {{and several others}} also received <b>votes.</b> <b>Of</b> these, the two leading candidates were Major General Winfield Scott Hancock from Pennsylvania and Senator Thomas F. Bayard from Delaware. Tilden was not officially a candidate, but he wielded a heavy influence over the convention. Tilden was ambiguous about his willingness to participate in another campaign, leading some delegates to defect to other candidates, while others stayed loyal to their old standard-bearer.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{addressed}} the party's platform committee, {{and his name}} was placed in nomination at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, where he delivered a speech that strongly criticized President Reagan and praised Democratic unity. He received the <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> four delegates. He went on to actively support the Mondale–Geraldine Ferraro ticket, whose eventual landslide defeat bore some similarities to his own in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Re-elected in 1866, Hayes {{returned}} to the lame-duck session {{to vote for the}} Tenure of Office Act, which ensured that Johnson could not remove administration officials without the Senate's consent.

Hayes continued to vote with the majority in the 40th Congress on the Reconstruction Acts, but resigned in July 1867 to campaign for governor of Ohio.|$|E
