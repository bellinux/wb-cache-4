5|$|Domestication is {{also studied}} {{by using the}} genetic {{material}} of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. The <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds. This {{is reflected in the}} difference in genetic variation between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (Y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial DNA). There are very low levels of Y-chromosome variability, but a great deal of genetic <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> mitochondrial DNA. There is also regional <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> mitochondrial DNA due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds. Another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color <b>variation.</b> <b>In</b> horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 BC.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new <b>variation.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> a population, {{even in the absence}} of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E

40|$|Profiles of the Mg II h and k {{emission}} {{features in}} the spectra of 21 late-type giant stars were obtained. Emission strengths were separately measured in the shortward (S) and longward (L) components. <b>Variations</b> <b>in</b> total emission intensity (S + L) {{can be interpreted as}} evidence for <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> the rate of mechanical energy deposition in the chromosphere. Mass loss processes in the corona/outer atmosphere may be strong enough to affect the ratio of S/L: thus, rapid mass loss causes S/L to be less than unity. Rapid mass loss is likely caused by deposition of mechanical energy by stellar wind. <b>Variations</b> <b>in</b> S/L are a measure of <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> the rate of mechanical energy deposition in the corona/outer atmosphere. The stellar sample variations were divided into four classes: (1) <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> S/L; (2) <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> the circumstellar absorption components; (3) <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> the total flux; and (4) no evidence for variations found on the time scales used...|$|R

40|$|Strain data {{obtained}} by vault-housed extensometers have precisions {{on the order of}} nanostrains, but they are distorted by <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> temperature, which cause two types of noise: “actual variations” due to the thermo-elastic effect of the Earth's crust, and “false variations” due to the thermal expansion of extensometer, which occurs when the extensometers themselves are subjected to <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> temperature. Here, I explore a method of removing false variations, which are severe when the vault is located at shallow depths. If <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> temperature at arbitrary points inside a vault are estimated, false variations can be removed from the recorded <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> strain. I derive formulae that enable <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> temperature to be estimated at various points in a vault, based on measured variations at reference points. The formulation is valid if some simplification is allowed. I examined whether <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> temperature inside a vault can be estimated in terms of the derived formulae, and obtained the following results. When the reference temperature data are obtained from adequate points <b>in</b> the vault, <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> temperature at another point can be estimated with an accuracy of 0. 1 °C. However, when the reference temperature data are obtained from outside the vault, estimated <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> temperature are rather inaccurate, which means that the false <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> strain cannot be removed accurately. Moreover, the data indicate that the thermal diffusivity of the ground is temporally variable, and this introduces another difficulty <b>in</b> correcting false <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> strain data. These results indicate that correcting the distortions in strain data due to <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> temperature is much more difficult than anticipated...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Stem CO 2 efflux (E s) is a {{significant}} component of total ecosystem respiration, but there is only scant information on seasonal <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> E s in tropical rainforests and on the main factors explaining these variations. • Methods We conducted a comprehensive 18 -month study in French Guiana to try to better understand which environmental factors contribute to seasonal <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> E s in two habitats differing in soil water conditions. • Results In both habitats, large seasonal <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> E s were observed for most trees. The main variations occurred during climatic transition periods and were consistent with seasonal <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> soil and total ecosystem respiration. • Discussion Seasonal <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> atmospheric conditions, including air temperature, did not explain seasonal <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> E s. <b>In</b> contrast, seasonal <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> surface soil water content clearly induced seasonal <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> E s in each habitat. Both soil drought and flooded conditions induced a decrease in E s. • Conclusion Our results emphasize the need to integrate the influence of soil water content on E s into global models that simulate the response of forest ecosystem fluxes to climate changes...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{scoliosis}} surgery, intraoperative somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) {{are affected}} by physiological parameters, which also have a complicated interaction with each other. Previous studies have reported on how these parameters individually affect SEPs. However, {{there has been no}} systematic analysis of these effects. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationships between <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> intraoperative SEPs and various physiological parameters. Material/Methods: Seventy scoliosis patients who underwent intraoperative SEP monitoring were enrolled in this retrospective study. <b>Variations</b> <b>in</b> latency and amplitude were analyzed to evaluate their relationships to blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and partial pressure of alveolar carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) using gray correlation degree analysis. Results: <b>Variations</b> <b>in</b> latency and amplitude correlated most closely with <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> temperature, PaCO 2, and heart rate, followed by <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> diastolic and then systolic blood pressure. Conclusions: <b>Variations</b> <b>in</b> different physiological parameters are related to <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> intraoperative SEPs to different degrees. Monitoring specialists should take this into consideration when making decisions based on abnormal SEPs. © Med Sci Monit, 2009. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
