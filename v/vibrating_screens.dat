Dynamic characteristic of the <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> was researched and dynamic simulation method of large screening machines was explored. We used finite element method (FEM) to analyze dynamic characteristic of large <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> with hyperstatic net-beam structure. Multi natural frequency, natural modes of vibration and dynamic response of the <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> were calculated. The structural size of stiffeners on the side plate was optimized under multiple frequencies constraints and an adaptive optimization criterion was given. The {{results show that the}} vibrating screen’s structural strength is increased and the natural frequency of bending deformation is enhanced. The modal frequencies are far from working frequency, and thus the structure is able to avoid resonance effectively and reduce the destructiveness. The maximum transverse displacement of the <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> is 0. 13 mm, the maximum difference in vibration amplitude of corresponding points is 0. 44 mm and the maximum dynamic stress is 16. 63 MPa.

50|$|High {{frequency}} <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens</b> are {{the most}} important screening machines primarily utilised in the mineral processing industry. They are used to separate feeds containing solid and crushed ores down to approximately 200μm in size, and are applicable to both perfectly wetted and dried feed. The frequency of the screen is mainly controlled by an electromagnetic vibrator which is mounted above and directly connected to the screening surface. Its high frequency characteristics differentiates it from a normal vibrating screen. The high frequency <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens</b> usually operates at an inclined angle, traditionally varying between 0 and 25 degrees and can go up to a maximum of 45 degrees. Besides, it should operate at a low stroke and has a frequency ranging from 1500 - 7200 RPM.|$|E

Industrial EngineeringThe {{ability to}} respond to changes and {{uncertainty}} in production demands currently constitutes a crisis in small and medium scale mining industries in South Africa. The case study of various mining and mineral processing site visits which was carried out revealed that the existing conventional screening methods are not scalable or able to be integrated and have limited processing capacity, which constitutes a high production cost on a long-term basis. In view of this, the Reconfigurable <b>Vibrating</b> <b>Screen</b> machine was designed and manufactured with the intension of eliminating these challenges faced by small and medium scale mining industries. The newly developed <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> utilizes the concept of re-configurability, making it simple to attain full capacity processing production on the same machine.

50|$|The high {{frequency}} <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens</b> achieves a high efficiency of separation and differs from its counterparts since it {{breaks down the}} surface tension between particles. Also {{the high level of}} RPMs contributes to increasing the stratification of material so they separate at a much higher rate. Separation cannot take place without stratification. Furthermore, since the screen vibrates vertically, there is a ‘popcorn effect’ whereby the coarser particles are lifted higher and finer particles stay closer to the screen, thus increases the probability of separation. In some {{high frequency}} <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens</b> the flow rate of the feed can be controlled, this is proportional to the ‘popcorn effect’; if the flow rate lowers, the effect is also decreased. Limitations of the high frequency vibrating screen are that the fine screens are very fragile and are susceptible to becoming blocked very easily. Over time the separation efficiency will drop and the screen will need to be replaced.|$|E
50|$|Trommel screens {{can be used}} in {{a variety}} of {{applications}} such as classification of solid waste and recovery of valuable minerals from raw materials. Trommels come in many designs such as concentric screens, series or parallel arrangement and each component has a few configurations. However depending on the application required, trommels have several advantages and limitations over other screening processes such as <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens,</b> grizzly screens, roller screens, curved screens and gyratory screen separators.|$|E
50|$|However more {{material}} can be screened at once for a vibrating screen {{compared to a}} trommel screen. This is because {{only one part of}} the screen area of the trommel screen is utilised during the screening process whilst the entire screen is used for a vibrating screen. Trommel screens are also more susceptible to plugging and blinding, especially when different sized screen apertures are in series. Plugging is when material larger than the aperture may become stuck or wedged into the apertures and then may be forced through which is undesirable. Blinding is when wet material clump up and stick {{to the surface of the}} screen. The vibrations in the <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens</b> reduce the chance of plugging and blinding.|$|E

The analysis result suggests the danger area where beam is prone to fracture because of fatigue. The improvement scheme of the beam structure is proposed and a theoretical basis is provided for the same type of product design in the future. The failure form of the beam is fatigue failure. The maximum equivalent stress value of the improved beam structure comparing to the original design is decreased obviously, improving the stress state and the fatigue life and reliability of the liner <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen.</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> is that {{particles}} are introduced to the gaps in the screens repeatedly. The frequency of the screen must be high enough so that it prevents the particles from blocking the apertures and the maximum height of the particle trajectory should occur when the screen surface is at its lowest point. Based on the principle, there is an optimum frequency and amplitude of vibration [...] Transmission refers to the fraction of desired particle that passes through the apertures in the screen. At low frequency, screening efficiency is high but blinding is severe. Blinding will decrease as frequency increases but the particles will have difficulty going through the apertures. When designing a high frequency <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen,</b> an optimum point of frequency and amplitude must be chosen, depending on the specific applications.|$|R
40|$|Persistent {{fatigue failure}} {{observed}} in <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> side plates motivated this investigation {{to determine the}} effects of plasma cutting on the surface integrity and hence fatigue performance of mild steel plates. Fatigue crack initiation and propagation was reported to have occurred in a number of <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> side plates in which bolt holes had been produced using plasma cutting. This cutting technique had been introduced to reduce bolt hole production times thus replacing the traditional hole drilling technique previously used. This inadvertently modified the surface conditions of the material. Since fatigue is largely a surface phenomenon due to a number of factors such as stress concentration and surface roughness, fatigue strength was unintentionally compromised. A proper assessment is always required to test the effect of new processing techniques on service performance before implementation. Although full scale fatigue testing is too expensive, low cost surface integrity tests can be conducted to assess the impact of the new technique on anticipated fatigue performance. Experimental assessments done on the plasma-cut mild steel plate using microstructure and micro-hardness testing techniques revealed clear evidence of material hardening. Since increased hardening implies increased notch sensitivity, it was therefore concluded that plasma cutting has the effect of reducing the fatigue strength of mild steel components hence the observed fatigue failures in <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> side plates.,Zimbabwe Institution of Engineer...|$|R

50|$|An {{alternative}} to the high frequency <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens</b> is the rotary sifter. A rotary sifter uses a screen which rotates in a circular motion and the finer particles are sifted through the apertures. It is also generally used for finger separations; between 12mm to 45μm particle size. The rotary sifter will usually be chosen based {{on the nature of}} the substance being separated; whey, yeast bread mix, cheese powder, fertilizers. The rotary sifter is often preferred in the non-metallurgical industry and operates in a way to achieve a dust and noise free environment. The limitation for the rotary sifter is that it cannot handle a high capacity compared to the high frequency vibrating screen. Both equipment, however, achieve a high screening efficiency.|$|E
