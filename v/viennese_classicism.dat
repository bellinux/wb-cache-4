The city's roots lie in early Celtic and Roman settlements that transformed into a Medieval and Baroque city, and then {{the capital of the}} Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is well known for having played an essential role as a leading European music centre, from the great age of <b>Viennese</b> <b>Classicism</b> through {{the early part of the}} 20th century. The historic centre of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque castles and gardens, and the late-19th-century Ringstraße lined with grand buildings, monuments and parks.|$|E

40|$|Koch can be revelatory for a {{reconstruction}} of contem-porary ways of hearing <b>Viennese</b> high <b>classicism.</b> Koch’s claims revolve around {{interactions between the}} metrical placement of cadences and the articulation of specific beat levels, and these claims are most specific and test-able for common time and 6 / 8. This paper reports two statistical surveys of works by Mozart that were designed to gauge the fit between the corpus and Koch’s theory. In the works examined, the theory was strongly supported for common time, strongly disconfirmed for 6 / 8, and weakly supported for the other meters encoun-tered. It is argued that these results point toward caution {{regarding the use of}} Koch’s theories but not toward their outright rejection, and that unexpected statistical contrasts within the corpus indicate the need for a fine-grained approach to meter in music of the later 18 th century...|$|R
50|$|The best-known composers {{from this}} period are Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Franz Schubert; other notable names include Luigi Boccherini, Muzio Clementi, Antonio Salieri, Leopold Mozart, Johann Christian Bach, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, and Christoph Willibald Gluck. Ludwig van Beethoven is {{regarded}} either as a Romantic composer or a Classical period composer {{who was part of}} the transition to the Romantic era. Franz Schubert is also a transitional figure, as were Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Luigi Cherubini, and Carl Maria von Weber. The period is sometimes referred to as the era of <b>Viennese</b> Classic or <b>Classicism</b> (Wiener Klassik), since Gluck, Mozart, Haydn, Salieri, and Beethoven all worked in Vienna and Schubert was born there.|$|R
50|$|The {{repertoire}} {{includes a}} range of music styles, including <b>Viennese</b> <b>Classicism,</b> Romanticism and 20th-century classical music, including works by Polish composers.The Grzegorz Fitelberg International Competition for Conductors is held in Katowice every 5 years (9th edition, 2012). In previous years, the competition was held at 4-year intervals.|$|E
50|$|Gollner's {{interest}} centre on medieval music; he {{has studied}} early vocal and instrumental polyphony (including {{the origins of}} keyboard music), notation and oral musical traditions. His writings on scripture settings have included investigations on psalmody, masses and the relation of both monophobic and polyphonic Gospel settings to liturgical drama from the medieval era up to <b>Viennese</b> <b>classicism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Müller kept J. S. Bach's {{works in}} the {{repertoire}} and {{also contributed to the}} spread of <b>Viennese</b> <b>Classicism.</b> In 1801 he conducted the first performance outside Vienna of Haydn's The Seasons. He composed for the piano, writing two concertos, fourteen sonatas and various capriccios and other pieces. He also wrote seven flute concertos and other works for flute and orchestra, along with études for flute and piano. His son, Theodor Amadeus Müller, was a violinist.|$|E
50|$|The core work of {{the choir}} is based on Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel. In addition, most major oratorios and choral works {{as well as a}} variety of a cappella pieces are part of the choir's repertoire. Major works are {{regularly}} performed in the Marktkirche, Wiesbaden, and in Eberbach Abbey. The orchestra is the Bach Ensemble Wiesbaden, formed by leading musicians of orchestras in the Rhine-Main area. Works of <b>Viennese</b> <b>Classicism</b> and Romanticism are presented in historically informed performance.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of Austrians are traditionally Roman Catholic.Roman Catholicism in Austria {{has played a}} significant role both in the culture and in the politics of Austria. It enabled the House of Habsburg to rule Spain and its empire as a Catholic Monarchy from the 16th century, and it determined the role of Habsburg Austria in the Thirty Years' War. The music in the tradition of <b>Viennese</b> <b>classicism</b> is sacral to a significant extent, including works such as Mozart's Great Mass in C minor, masses by Joseph Haydn (1750-1802), Beethoven's Mass in C major (1807), down to Bruckner's Te Deum (1903).|$|E
50|$|The Wiener Klangstil {{is rooted}} stylistically {{in the rules}} of {{interpretation}} of <b>Viennese</b> <b>Classicism</b> mixed with German Romanticism. There is a clear preference for instruments which allow the player to control tone colour within a particular musical context. Just as the individual is subject to a process of continual change, so, too, is the characteristic style and timbre of an orchestra. An example of this constant evolutionary process {{can be heard in}} the use of vibrato by the strings of the Vienna Philharmonic during the 20th century. Similarly, the “Wiener Klangstil” is not fixed, though the adherence to the fundamental principles of timbre and style does not change, and this fundamental principle of timbre governs the range of wind instruments found only in Vienna.|$|E

50|$|Of music written {{originally}} for guitar, {{the earliest}} important composers {{are from the}} classical period and include Fernando Sor (b. Spain 1778) and Mauro Giuliani (b. Italy 1781), both of whom wrote in a style strongly influenced by <b>Viennese</b> <b>classicism.</b> In the 19th century guitar composers such as Johann Kaspar Mertz (b. Slovakia, Austria 1806) were strongly influenced by {{the dominance of the}} piano. Not {{until the end of the}} nineteenth century did the guitar begin to establish its own unique identity. Francisco Tárrega (b. Spain 1852) was central to this, sometimes incorporating stylized aspects of flamenco's Moorish influences into his romantic miniatures. This was part of late 19th century mainstream European musical nationalism. Albéniz and Granados were central to this movement; their evocation of the guitar was so successful that their compositions have been absorbed into standard guitar repertoire.|$|E
5000|$|Lindblad's studies under Zelter {{for a year}} in Berlin {{may have}} been his biggest musical influence. Lindblad also {{appears to have been}} {{influenced}} by composers of <b>Viennese</b> <b>Classicism</b> such as Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Haydn. Lindblad's style as a result sounds very late Classical to early Romantic, which is particularly apparent in his Symphony No. 1 in C major and Symphony No. 2 in D major. Many elements of the First Symphony are reminiscent of Beethoven's Eroica and Weber's First Symphony. The resemblance is heard especially in the opening horn fanfare in the first movement. The particular use of the horn in the [...] "Scherzo" [...] is also comparable to Haydn's Hornsignal Symphony. The third movement, “Adagio e molto,” is described as bearing resemblance to late works of Mozart. In the final movement, Lindblad explores various styles, opening with a fugue and abruptly changing to a lyrical melody played by flutes. A motif is also very similar to the “terrace” motif in Beethoven's Ninth.|$|E
5000|$|Although some {{scholars}} {{believe that he}} studied with Haydn, {{there is no proof}} of this. But there can be no question that he studied and was influenced by Haydn's quartets. Like Haydn, Wranitzky's quartet writing went through many stages of development beginning with the pre-classical and evolving to the finished sonata form of late <b>Viennese</b> <b>classicism.</b> The majority of his quartets are in three movements; many share the qualities of the Parisian quatuor concertant, with virtuoso writing in all four parts. In these works, he explored the emerging Romantic style with (for the time) daring harmonic progressions, theatrical gestures and virtuoso display. Based on the ten Wranitzky quartets he has studied, music historian and Reicha scholar Ron Drummond writes, [...] "I can safely and with absolute confidence say that Wranitzky's achievement as a composer of string quartets is a greater achievement, overall, than Mozart's. Lest that statement be misunderstood, let me clarify: it's simply that Wranitzky's output dwarfs Mozart's, and the quality of each man's (mature) productions is so superb that Wranitzky wins by sheer numbers." ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the genre of}} the orchestral serenade {{in the context of}} reflections on “old” and “new”. The serenade form was rediscovered for the 19 th century by the German composer Johannes Brahms, who built on the legacy of <b>Viennese</b> <b>classicism.</b> In the case of Antonín Dvořák’s Serenade for Wind Instruments, op. 44, it is also possible, on the basis of analysis and historical connections, to speculate about classicist models, specifically Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s Serenade in B Flat Major, KV 361 / 370 a. Dvořák took Brahms’ initiative a step further, with his Serenade op. 44 presaging the trend in development towards neoclassicism, which, however, was to come much later...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyze musical form in german {{composer}} Robert Schumann’s works (8 June 1810 – 29 July 1856), particularly that of piano solo piece Carnaval, op. 9, trying to understand what is revealed by the way he uses it in relation to his personality, not only in artistic terms (taking into account the context of German Romanticism) but also on a deeper psychological level. To come to an understanding of Schumann’s use of form, this paper begins with a brief description of the evolution of musical form since <b>Viennese</b> <b>Classicism,</b> with additional references to the baroque system of ‘affects’. Form in Schumann is compared with that of other significant composers of the romantic period and various points of intersection between music and other arts are analyzed, especially literature, in certain key works of this period. Parting from these reflections, we explore the question of the expressive intention behind his handling of form in Carnaval, op. 9. The aim of the investigation of this aspect is to understand how far the innovatory use of this parameter in Schumann, reflects a unique vision of the art of music. </p...|$|E
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the elevation of Anton Webern as the figurehead of atonality and a precursor to post-war serialism, the composerâs tonal repertoire has been widely regarded as embarrassing works of juvenilia and so merely a parergon to what was yet to come, {{to the extent that it}} has remained little known and understudied up to this day. The first extensive account of Webernâs tonal music (1899 â 1908), this dissertation explores the complex and variegated ways in which the young Webern engaged with, and sought actively to contribute to, the cultural ideas and discourses of turn-of-the-century modernism, well before he would self-consciously embark upon his famous âpathâ to the New Music. Through close study of key works such as the symphonic tone poem Im Sommerwind, the âSegantiniâ string quartet, and the Passacaglia for large orchestra op. 1 in light of recent developments in the theory and analysis of late nineteenth-century tonal music (sonata deformation theory, extended Schenkerian techniques, and neo-Riemannian transformations), each chapter illuminates a unique aspect of Webernâs early modernist imagination. Providing a wealth of new historical and philological insights from the manuscripts, sketches, and biographical documents archived at the Paul Sacher Foundation, this study addresses Webernâs aesthetic interest in the evocation of atmosphere and lyrical temporality, the Zarathustrian meaning-strata embedded in his musical language, the formal functions of his use of energetic waves, and his revisionary understanding of <b>Viennese</b> <b>Classicism</b> at a time when Vienna was precariously poised between historicist tendencies on the one hand and attempts at a radical reformation of the past on the other. The discussion is framed by a post-Adornian/post-Dahlhausian concern for a critical reappraisal of the category of âearly styleâ. While acknowledging the rapid stylistic transformation that Webernâs tonal language underwent, shaped in particular by his studies with Arnold Schoenberg from 1904 â 1908, it will be suggested that âearlinessâ in Webern is not simply a chronological term but is rather best understood in terms of a constitutive tension between phenomenological and dialectical modes of musical thought â a tension which had crystallised at the turn-of-the-century as essentially irreconcilable and yet formed the discursive matrix though which much of Webernâs aesthetic physiognomy was shaped. In this way, this dissertation is as much a study of the generative elements of Webernâs musical imagination as it is a study of the intellectual milieus of Viennese modernism. </p...|$|E
