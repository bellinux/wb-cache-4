30|$|In {{addition}} to the above applications, M 2 M communication provides additional services in logistics such as decreased operational cost, high inventory flexibility, increased supply chain visibility, and reduced loss of <b>vehicles</b> <b>and</b> <b>containers</b> [21]. In supply chains, M 2 M technology enables tracking the status of goods in real-time via M 2 M devices. This increasing visibility allows for significant reduction in uncertainties in supply chain [22]. Similarly, in a warehouse, M 2 M devices can be deployed to track the inventory so that stockholders and enterprises can respond to the market dynamics and to decide when to refill and when to go on sale. Moreover, cross talk among vehicles can also be effective to get immediate assistance. Additionally, direct delivery of inventory from one vehicle to another without storing it in a warehouse can also be accomplished through mutual information sharing. Consequently, it can significantly reduce the required space of warehouse, customer’s waiting {{time as well as}} the operational costs for business entities.|$|E
40|$|AbstractUrban goods {{distribution}} {{is important for}} the economy. However urban transport causes traffic, noise and pollution. The European Research project CityLog (part of Framework Programme 7) aims at increasing efficiency in urban distribution by proposing a logistics model based on two types of <b>vehicles</b> <b>and</b> <b>containers</b> solution in the context of parcel delivery. The urban delivery scheme currently consists of a number of vehicles that leave the hub and drive towards the city. The innovative logistics model for urban deliveries introduces a concept which make use of two types of vehicles: a Freight bus which is loaded at the depot with several load units that can carry generic parcels, and a Delivery van which is a light vehicle with high eco-compatible characteristics that make it very suitable {{to be used in the}} inner city Each load unit, when transferred from the Freight bus to the Delivery van, replaces the body of the van. These interoperable <b>vehicles</b> <b>and</b> <b>containers</b> form an improved logistics chain, reducing the number of vehicles entering the city, chilometers driven and pollutant emissions. Another source of unnecessary driven chilometers is unsuccessful deliveries when the receiver is not home during the delivery. The Modular BentoBox is the second concept introduced by the project. It allows to obtain a balance between optimisation of logistics and customer's interests by delivering goods to the bentobox, instead that to the customer location. There parcels are stored in the bentobox until the customer picks them up. The Modular BentoBox System introduces the concept of removable modules that is trolleys with various size drawers. These trolleys and their drawers are filled in with parcels at the depot. The carrier transports the trolleys downtown and inserts them into the bentobox. As soon as the customer is notified, the parcel is ready at the bentobox. To access the parcel, the customer enters his special code on a user interface. The Modular BentoBox System can also be provided with a weighting and payment system and used for shipping parcels. The trolleys with shipments are taken back to the depot by the carrier. These CityLog concepts will be implemented and tested in 2012 in three European cities: Berlin, Lyon and Turin...|$|E

The results obtained show that scale inefficiency was lower than pure technical efficiency, the latter is linked to service management. It was observed that the street-cleaning activity was performed more inefficiently than that of waste collection. Furthermore, it was detected that municipalities can reduce the resources used in rendering this service by 8 %.

30|$|Fleet {{management}} {{is one of}} the major applications of automotive M 2 M communications in logistical processes [123]. The movements of vehicles, containers, buses, cars, etc. are being tracked regularly through M 2 M devices which collect data, e.g., of the location, vehicle speed, temperature, distribution progress, fuel consumption, etc., and send this information to monitoring servers. Through regular monitoring, several activities of the system can be performed in an efficient way. For instance, the goods which are transported from one place to another are monitored regularly in order to accomplish in time delivery and to handle any undesirable situation during shipment processes. In summary, M 2 M communication addresses the following main issues in logistics, (1) Global Connectivity: the cargo moves across several regions/countries and thus must be monitored in order to stay updated; (2) Reporting: with the help of reporting, the exact location of the freight and the conditions of the objects can be easily monitored; and (3) Alarming: in applications such as warehouse management, fleet management, robotics, and control systems alarms are used to detect critical or emergency situations. Besides, M 2 M communications in logistics can provide additional services such as decreased operational cost, high inventory flexibility, increased supply chain visibility, and reduced loss of <b>vehicles</b> <b>and</b> <b>containers</b> [129].|$|E

40|$|The {{appropriate}} sizing {{of storage}} areas {{to optimize the}} management of intermodal transport, the adoption of environment protection systems and the appropriate flow’s regulations inside manoeuvre’s zones can solve many problems encountered today in a intermodal marine terminal. For these reasons the “integrated design” of storage areas for <b>vehicles</b> <b>and</b> <b>containers</b> is considered essential to ensure efficiency and functionality for all harbour-system. So is here proposed a simulative model {{as a tool for}} a more correct design of waiting areas by considering the real stochastic conditions of the process of the arrivals. For the sizing of areas for containers in the harbours, it is necessary to report the storage capacity in terms of TEU that can be stored (and handled) in the unit of time, e. g. in one year, with the extension of sites for storage of boxes and furniture with the other specific operating parameters. The sizing of storage areas of the goods date constitutes a delicate problem the frequent shortage of the areas available. The ability to warehouse of the terminal is essentially determined from the interrelation between fixed and static parameters in the short period which the extension of the storage area, the height of the overlapping batteries of container (defined also like number of “shooting”), the means of movements and, at last, a series of parameters that can vary the efficiency’s degree according to of the operatives of the terminal.

40|$|More {{frequent}} vehicle {{movements are}} required for moving containers in a local area due to low unit volume that a single vehicle can handle compared with vessels and rails involved in the container supply chain. For this reason, truck operations for moving containers significantly affect not only transportation cost itself but also product price. They have inherent operational inefficiencies associated with empty container movements and container processes at facilities such as warehouses, distribution centers and intermodal terminals. One critical issue facing the trucking industry is the pressing need for truck routing plans that reduce such inefficiencies. Hence, this dissertation proposes to apply the concept of sharing resources, which is an emerging economic model, to container truck operations in order to resolve this issue. Two shareable resources – <b>vehicles</b> <b>and</b> <b>containers</b> – are considered. This study extends the literature on routing and scheduling problems that arise from container movements, and examines the possible benefits of sharing resources across customers. A series of truck container routing and scheduling problems were developed by assuming different levels of resource sharing among; (1) customers of one trucking operator, (2) customers across collaborations of multiple operators, and (3) customers over multi-day operations. To enable a trucking company to operate its fleet under a shared resource environment, two operational strategies – street turning and decoupling operations – together with temporal precedence constraints – {{in addition to the}} time constraints that are typically included in the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) – were adopted to address the proposed problems. Two meta-heuristic algorithms based on a variable neighborhood search (VNS) scheme were developed to solve the proposed problems, including temporal precedence constraints – which are computationally more expensive – for real-world applications. To address flexible time windows resulting from temporal precedence constraints, a novel feasibility check algorithm was developed. Results from a series of numerical experiments confirm that the proposed approach leverages the advantages of resource sharing, and the meta-heuristic algorithms are efficient solution approaches for each problem with the targeted resource sharing. Consequently, this dissertation offers a platform {{for the development of a}} decision-support tool for drayage companies by applying three different levels of resource sharing into their operations...|$|E
