25|$|Professional digital {{printing}} (using toner) primarily uses an electrical charge to transfer toner or liquid ink to the substrate onto {{which it is}} printed. Digital print quality has steadily improved from early color and black and white copiers to sophisticated colour digital presses such as the Xerox iGen3, the Kodak Nexpress, the HP Indigo Digital Press series, and the InfoPrint 5000. The iGen3 and Nexpress use toner particles and the Indigo uses liquid ink. The InfoPrint 5000 is a full-color, continuous forms inkjet drop-on-demand printing system. All handle <b>variable</b> <b>data,</b> and rival offset in quality. Digital offset presses are also called direct imaging presses, although these presses can receive computer files and automatically turn them into print-ready plates, they cannot insert <b>variable</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E
40|$|Historically, {{calibration}} {{results have}} typically been recorded {{and stored in}} the form of attributes data. In the past few years, however, an apparent trend has begun to emerge for recording and storing calibration results {{in the form of}} <b>variables</b> <b>data.</b> This is partly due to ISO/IEC 17025 requirements for uncertainty analysis and partly due to the growing implementation of six-sigma or other SPC quality control systems. The growing availability of <b>variables</b> <b>data</b> has positive implications for calibration interval analysis. This paper describes a methodology for determining calibration intervals from <b>variables</b> <b>data.</b> A regression analysis analytical approach is developed and algorithms are given for setting parameter calibration intervals from the results of <b>variables</b> <b>data</b> analysis. ...|$|R

25|$|Trafficking {{diverted}} {{an estimated}} one cent of each SNAP dollar ($330 million annually) from SNAP benefits between 2006 and 2008. Trafficking has declined over time from nearly 4 {{percent in the}} 1990s. About 8.2 percent of all stores trafficked from 2006 to 2008 compared to the 10.5 percent of SNAP authorized stores involved in trafficking in 2011. A variety of store characteristics and settings {{were related to the}} level of trafficking. Although large stores accounted for 87.3 percent of all SNAP redemptions, they only accounted for about 5.4 percent of trafficking redemptions. Trafficking was much less likely to occur among publicly owned than privately owned stores and was much less likely among stores in areas with less poverty rather than more. The total annual value of trafficked benefits increased at about the same rate as overall program growth. The current estimate of total SNAP dollars trafficked is higher than observed in the previous 2002–2005 time period. This increase is consistent, however, with the almost 37 percent growths in average annual SNAP benefits from the 2002–2005 study periods to the most recent one. The methodology used to generate these estimates has known limitations. However, given <b>variable</b> <b>data</b> and resources, it is the most practical approach available to FNS. Further improvements to SNAP trafficking estimates would require new resources to assess the prevalence of trafficking among a random sample of stores.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Control chart {{techniques}} {{have been widely}} used in industries to monitor a process in quality improvement. Whenever we deal with <b>variables</b> <b>data,</b> we usually employ a combination of X-bar chart and R chart (or S chart) to monitor both the center and the spread of the process. In this paper, we propose a simple alternative, that is, we design a single chart to monitor both the center and the spread for <b>variables</b> <b>data.</b> When compared with the combination of X-bar chart and S chart, the proposed chart is shown to be just as effective. An example is given to show how to use this new chart. Key words and phrases: Average run length, control chart, <b>variables</b> <b>data.</b> 1...|$|R

2500|$|In summary, {{the issues}} are as follows. Navitaire contend that {{copyright}} subsists in the command set as a copyright work distinct from the source code. This claim {{has a number of}} aspects: (i) the collection of commands as a whole is entitled to copyright as a 'compilation'; (ii) each of the commands is a copyright work in its own right; (iii) alternatively, each of the 'complex' commands is a work in its own right. As to the displays, Navitaire contend that (i) in respect of the VT100 screen displays, the 'template' (fixed data and layout of <b>variable</b> <b>data)</b> is a separate copyright work for each display and (ii) certain GUI screens on the separate Schedule Maintenance module are copyright works as they stand and have been copied. Then it is said (and this is a quite distinct allegation) that the similarity exhibited by eRes to OpenRes {{in the eye of the}} user is such that there has been 'non-textual copying' of the whole of the source code. This is said to be strictly analogous to taking the plot of a book: an author who takes the plot of another work and copies nothing else will still infringe copyright if a substantial part of the earlier author's work is represented by that plot, and the same goes for computer programs: John Richardson Computers v Flanders [...] FSR 497 (Ferris J).|$|E

50|$|Local {{data are}} not shared by any, {{re-entering}} or not, routines; therefore, they do not affect re-entrance. Global data is defined outside functions, and can be accessed {{by more than one}} function, either in form of global <b>variables</b> (<b>data</b> shared between all functions), or as static <b>variables</b> (<b>data</b> shared by all functions of the same name). In object-oriented programming, global data is defined in the scope of a class and can be private, making it accessible only to functions of that class. There is also the concept of instance variables, where a class variable is bound to a class instance. For these reasons, in object-oriented programming this distinction is usually reserved for the data accessible outside of the class (public), and for the data independent of class instances (static).|$|R
