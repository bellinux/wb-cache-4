500|$|In {{the fictional}} {{universe}} of Joe 90, the Cold War—significant {{at the time}} of the series' TV debut, owing to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968—has ended, and a world government has been established. WIN is the successor organisation to MI6, the CIA and the KGB, all of which have been merged in the formation of the global network. Although the pilot sees Joe hijacking a Russian jet fighter to expose the secrets of its construction to the West, the storyline is ultimately revealed to be a speculative fiction posited by Weston as an example of the espionage that Joe would have to perform if he were to join WIN. The plot twist, in particular the revelation that Russia and the West are allies in the future, is praised by academic Nicholas J. Cull for its [...] "progressiveness of spirit", and for exemplifying Anderson's [...] " [...] an end to the Cold War as a given in his work". Anderson was motivated by what he perceived as a [...] "duty to the rising generation to avoid perpetuating Cold War stereotypes", once stating that he [...] "tried <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> put [...] ten cents into creating World War Three".|$|E

In a mixed review, Peter Debruge of Variety praised Brandon Trost's cinematography but said the film [...] "plays its boilerplate premise with endearing earnestness, but runs thin in no time". Matt Hawkins of Kotaku called it a [...] "legit goofball comedy" [...] and said it [...] "speaks to gamers without flat-out insulting them".

Nevertheless, this limit is <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> if <b>not</b> impossible <b>to</b> compute due to the diversity and complexity of probability models of multimedia contents.

50|$|A robust {{parameter}} design, {{introduced by}} Genichi Taguchi, is an experimental design used {{to exploit the}} interaction between control and uncontrollable noise variables by robustification -- finding the settings of the control factors that minimize response variation from uncontrollable factors. Control variables are variables of which the experimenter has full control. Noise variables lie {{on the other side}} of the spectrum, and while these variables may be easily controlled in an experimental setting, outside of the experimental world they are <b>very</b> <b>hard,</b> if <b>not</b> impossible, <b>to</b> control. Robust parameter designs use a naming convention similar to that of FFDs. A 2(m1+m2)-(p1-p2) is a 2-level design where m1 is the number of control factors, m2 is the number of noise factors, p1 is the level of fractionation for control factors, and p2 is the level of fractionation for noise factors.|$|R

This paper begins with a survey of representative cross-layer signalling methods.

Finally, the possible application areas of CLASS are identified, and a reference application programme is presented for applying CLASS into various management areas. I...|$|R

'But it so {{happened}} that I {{had a man}} in the hospital at the time, and going there to see about him the day before the opening of the Inquiry, I saw in the white men's ward that little chap tossing on his back, with his arm in splints, and quite light-headed. To my great surprise the other one, the long individual with drooping white moustache, had also found his way there. I remembered I had seen him slinking away during the quarrel, in a half prance, half shuffle, and trying <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> look scared. He was no stranger to the port, it seems, and in his distress was able to make tracks straight for Mariani's billiard-room and grog-shop near the bazaar. That unspeakable vagabond, Mariani, who had known the man and had ministered to his vices in one or two other places, kissed the ground, in a manner of speaking, before him, and shut him up with a supply of bottles in an upstairs room of his infamous hovel. It appears he was under some hazy apprehension as to his personal safety, and wished to be concealed. However, Mariani told me a long time after (when he came on board one day to dun my steward for the price of some cigars) that he would have done more for him without asking any questions, from gratitude for some unholy favour received very many years ago--as far as I could make out. He thumped twice his brawny chest, rolled enormous black-and-white eyes glistening with tears: [...] "Antonio never forget--Antonio never forget!" [...] What was the precise nature of the immoral obligation I never learned, but be it what it may, he had every facility given him to remain under lock and key, with a chair, a table, a mattress in a corner, and a litter of fallen plaster on the floor, in an irrational state of funk, and keeping up his pecker with such tonics as Mariani dispensed. This lasted till the evening of the third day, when, after letting out a few horrible screams, he found himself compelled to seek safety in flight from a legion of centipedes. He burst the door open, made one leap for dear life down the crazy little stairway, landed bodily on Mariani's stomach, picked himself up, and bolted like a rabbit into the streets. The police plucked him off a garbage-heap in the early morning. At first he had a notion they were carrying him off to be hanged, and fought for liberty like a hero, but when I sat down by his bed he had been very quiet for two days. His lean bronzed head, with white moustaches, looked fine and calm on the pillow, like the head of a war-worn soldier with a child-like soul, {{had it not been for}} a hint of spectral alarm that lurked in the blank glitter of his glance, resembling a nondescript form of a terror crouching silently behind a pane of glass. He was so extremely calm, that I began to indulge in the eccentric hope of hearing something explanatory of the famous affair from his point of view. Why I longed to go grubbing into the deplorable details of an occurrence which, after all, concerned me no more than as a member of an obscure body of men held together by a community of inglorious toil and by fidelity to a certain standard of conduct, I can't explain. You may call it an unhealthy curiosity if you like; but I have a distinct notion I wished to find something. Perhaps, unconsciously, I hoped I would find that something, some profound and redeeming cause, some merciful explanation, some convincing shadow of an excuse. I see well enough now that I hoped for the impossible--for the laying of what is the most obstinate ghost of man's creation, of the uneasy doubt uprising like a mist, secret and gnawing like a worm, and more chilling than the certitude of death--the doubt of the sovereign power enthroned in a fixed standard of conduct. It is the hardest thing to stumble against; it is the thing that breeds yelling panics and good little quiet villainies; it's the true shadow of calamity. Did I believe in a miracle? and why did I desire it so ardently? Was it for my own sake that I wished to find some shadow of an excuse for that young fellow whom I had never seen before, but whose appearance alone added a touch of personal concern to the thoughts suggested by the knowledge of his weakness--made it a thing of mystery and terror--like a hint of a destructive fate ready for us all whose youth--in its day--had resembled his youth? I fear that such was the secret motive of my prying. I was, and no mistake, looking for a miracle. The only thing that at this distance of time strikes me as miraculous is the extent of my imbecility. I positively hoped to obtain from that battered and shady invalid some exorcism against the ghost of doubt. I must have been pretty desperate too, for, without loss of time, after a few indifferent and friendly sentences which he answered with languid readiness, just as any decent sick man would do, I produced the word Patna wrapped up in a delicate question as in a wisp of floss silk. I was delicate selfishly; I did not want to startle him; I had no solicitude for him; I was not furious with him and sorry for him: his experience was of no importance, his redemption would have had no point for me. He had grown old in minor iniquities, and could no longer inspire aversion or pity. He repeated Patna? interrogatively, seemed to make a short effort of memory, and said: [...] "Quite right. I am an old stager out here. I saw her go down." [...] I made ready to vent my indignation at such a stupid lie, when he added smoothly, [...] "She was full of reptiles." ...|$|E
