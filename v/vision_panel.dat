40|$|Inherited eye {{disorders}} {{have a large}} {{clinical and}} genetic heterogeneity, which makes genetic diagnosis cumbersome. An exome-sequencing approach was developed in which data analysis was divided into two steps: the <b>vision</b> gene <b>panel</b> and exome analysis. In the <b>vision</b> gene <b>panel</b> analysis, variants in genes known to cause inherited eye disorders were assessed for pathogenicity. If no causative variants were detected and when the patient consented, the entire exome data was analyzed. A total of 266 Dutch patients with different types of inherited eye disorders, including inherited retinal dystrophies, cataract, developmental eye disorders and optic atrophy, were investigated. In the <b>vision</b> gene <b>panel</b> analysis (likely), causative variants were detected in 49 % and in the exome analysis in an additional 2 % of the patients. The highest detection rate of (likely) causative variants was in patients with inherited retinal dystrophies, for instance a yield of 63 % in patients with retinitis pigmentosa. In patients with developmental eye defects, cataract and optic atrophy, the detection rate was 50, 33 and 17 %, respectively. An exome-sequencing approach enables a genetic diagnosis in patients with different types of inherited eye disorders using one test. The exome approach has the same detection rate as targeted panel sequencing tests, but offers a number of advantages. For instance, the <b>vision</b> gene <b>panel</b> can be frequently and easily updated with additional (novel) eye disorder genes.

All had a visual acuity of 6 / 12 or better. The mfERG data {{were compared to}} templates derived from the control group at baseline. We analysed the mfERG results by averaging the central and peripheral fields and the superior and inferior fields (CP and SI methods) and by calculating the local responses. Results.

40|$|Abstract—Traffic signs {{detection}} and recognition has been thoroughly studied {{for a long}} time. However, traffic panel {{detection and}} recognition still remains a challenge in computer vision due to its different types and the huge variability of the information depicted in them. This paper presents a method to detect traffic panels in street-level images and to recognize the information contained on them, as an application to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The main purpose can be to make an automatic inventory of the traffic panels located in a road to support road maintenance and to assist drivers. Our proposal extracts local descriptors at some interest keypoints after applying blue and white color segmentation. Then, images are represented as a Bag of Visual Words and classified using Naı̈ve Bayes or SVM. This visual appearance categorization method is a new approach for traffic panel detection in the state-of-the-art. Finally, our own text detection and recognition method is applied on those images where a traffic panel has been detected, in order to automatically read and save the information depicted in the panels. We propose a language model partly based on a dynamic dictionary for a limited geographical area using a reverse geocoding service. Experimental results on real images from Google Street View prove {{the efficiency of the}} proposed method and give way to using street-level images for different applications on ITS.

30|$|Our {{research}} {{approach can be}} described as a dissensus-oriented Delphi, our interest not just in exploring an overall understanding of consensus, but also in the divergent orientations and <b>visions</b> within the <b>panel.</b> This approach resembles what Turoff describes as a Policy Delphi [26], and in recent works this position has been further elaborated by Tapio [25] and Steinert [24]. A common feature of these studies is exploration of opposing views, or dissensus, within a given sample of experts. In this study, we relied on factor analysis to locate a small number of unobserved variables (factors) based on similarities in the responses. These factors are constellations of projections that together describe (more or less) opposing orientations towards the future urban transport system. Since these are not fully elaborated scenarios, but rather divergent political and ideological orientations towards the urban future, we call them “visions”, which is in line with the terminology proposed by Heilbroner [21].|$|R

ITASEC 17 was held on January 17 - 20, 2017 in Venice and featured a Stakeholder Space and a Scientific/Technical Space, both spanning through the whole conference. The Stakeholder Space included selected distinguished keynotes speeches, invited talks, <b>vision</b> speeches, <b>panels</b> and the tutorial “Framework nazionale per la cybersecurity”, in Italian. The Scientific/Technical Space included three main tracks: a Scientific Track on Cybersecurity science and technology, a Fil Rouge Track with a sequence of multidisciplinary sessions on a specific hot topic in Cybersecurity, and a Demo Track devoted to prototypes developed by industries, research centers, and universities. The Fil Rouge track focused on “Fostering Security Through Web-Based Intelligence: Tools, Opportunities, and Inherent Limitations”. The conference solicited two kind of submissions: unpublished contributions and presentation only ones, e. g., already published work, preliminary work and position papers. There were 87 submissions: 48 in the unpublished category and 39 in the presentation only one. Each submission was reviewed by an average of 3 program committee members. The committee decided to accept 25 papers out of the 48 submitted for publication, which are included in this proceedings volume. The program also featured 34 presentations not included in this volume. The peer reviewing process has been dealt with through EasyChair. ITASEC 17 has required a huge effort by many people.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} and specificity of the Farnsworth Panel D- 15, Lanthony’s desaturated D- 15 and Farnsworth-Munsell (FM) 100 -hue panel tests were compared in up to 201 congenital colour defective (37 ± 15 years) and 230 colour normal (36 ± 14 years) males. Results were analysed using the colour difference vector technique of Vingrys and King-Smith (Vingrys & King-Smith 1988). Vector analysis yields three indices {{which can be used}} to quantify a cap arrangement: the C-index (severity), the S-Index (polarity) and the angle (axis). ROC analysis was performed on the C-index in order to identify the optimum fail criterion for each test. Our data indicate that the efficiencies of the panel tests (D- 15 = 1. 63, desat D- 15 = 1. 67 and FM 100 -hue = 1. 72) are much poorer than the Ishihara plate test efficiency (1. 98) for screening defects of colour <b>vision,</b> indicating that <b>panels</b> need to be supplemented with plate tests in screening protocols. Bayesian probabilities indicate that panel tests are successful in detecting colour defective vision (Pr {defective given fail at criterion} ≥ 0. 99) when a C-index of 2. 0 is used on the D- 15 panel, 3. 0 on the desaturated D- 15 panel and 2. 2 on the FM 100 -hue test; at these criteria all panels have an equal probability of predicting normal vision (0. 99).

40|$|Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine {{may have}} a toxic effect on retinal {{function}} during long-term treatment. Early signs of retinal dysfunction are reversible. If early signs of retinal dysfunction are not detected, an irreversible toxic retinal damage which can result in loss of vision will develop. This study compared and analysed various screening methods for the early diagnosis of retinal dysfunction in patients with long-term chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine treatment. Besides it was investigated if the multifocal ERG, a new electrophysiological technique, is able to detected early signs of retinal dysfunction. This study on 20 patients demonstrated the ability of multifocal electroretinogram to detect retinal dysfunction earlier or {{at the same time}} compared to other screening methods. In the multifocal electroretinogram, recorded with 61 hexagons, amplitudes and implicit times were evaluated. In 14 patients retinal dysfunction was found during the fundus examination, however, in only 7 patients pathologic retinal changes were seen. The investigation of the multifocal electroretinogram is a simple, well reproducible method, sutiable for an early diagnosis of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and therefore minimizing the risk of irreversile retina damage. Also in the work presented here ophthalmoscopic examination has been proved as important morphological screening method. The fluorescein angiography was less sensitive than the multifocal ERG, because of the allergically risk this examination is optional. Color <b>vision</b> tests (desaturated <b>Panel</b> D 15, HRR color plates) and visual field testing (perimeter) were less sensitive and specific than the multifocal electroretinogram. Alll patients with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine long-term therapy should have a semi-annual to annual ophthalmologic examination. The screeninig should be independend of the cumulative dose and the age. Patients with subjective complains such as difficulties with reading or color vision and photophobia should be counselled to return promptly to the ophthalmologist if there is any change in visual status. The screening program should contain the history, the examination of visual acuity with best correction, the ophthalmoscopic examination and the recording of the multifocal ERG...|$|R
40|$|Defence and Aerospace {{are major}} {{elements}} in the global economy. In the UK, they contribute significantly to wealth creation and quality of life, both directly {{and in terms of}} technology spin-off to other sectors. Aerospace alone contributes a £ 2 - 3 B surplus to the UK's trade balance. The UK is a leader in design and manufacture of advanced systems, deriving from programmes of R&D supported by industry and Government. In both Defence and Aerospace, the UK's market opportunities are enhanced by the operating competitiveness of UK companies which has improved radically over the past 15 years. The role of Government is more important in Defence and Aerospace than in any other industrial sector. In Defence and Aerospace, governments are market forces and, in terms of UK technology, the Defence Research Agency is a key national resource. The Future Defence and Aerospace are important markets for the future. The global market for Civil Aerospace is likely to grow significantly over the next 10 - 20 years. The UK is well placed to exploit this growth, through its involvement in the Airbus project, because of strong market positions in aeroengines and the equipment sector, and in market niches such as aerostructures and civil helicopters. Defence markets, although declining {{since the end of the}} Cold War, remain very substantial and offer many opportunities to exploit new technologies. New technologies are changing the nature of warfare, and new demands on defence forces require new technological solutions. The sectoral issue for the UK is whether it wishes to continue as a leader. The UK is in competition with other economies, notably the US, France and Germany, to host a significant share of the world Defence and Aerospace industry. To continue as a leader the UK must set strategic goals similar to those adopted by our competitors who are making vigorous efforts to sustain their product and technology bases. We cannot continue `consuming our technological inheritance '- and must begin now to regenerate our product range by adequately funded, well-focused investments in new technology. The <b>Panel's</b> <b>Vision,</b> towards which its recommendations are geared, is: Industry, Government and Academia working in partnership so that UK Defence and Aerospace continues as a major contributor to wealth and national security...|$|R
