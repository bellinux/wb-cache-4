50|$|Both {{slide and}} piston valves have the {{limitation}} that {{intake and exhaust}} events are fixed in relation {{to each other and}} cannot be independently optimised. Lap is provided on steam edges of the valve, so that although the <b>valve</b> <b>stroke</b> reduces as cutoff is advanced, the valve is always fully opened to exhaust. However, as cutoff is shortened, the exhaust events also advance. The exhaust release point occurs earlier in the power stroke and compression earlier in the exhaust stroke. Early release wastes some energy in the steam, and early closure also wastes energy in compressing an otherwise unnecessarily large quantity of steam. Another effect of early cutoff is that the valve is moving quite slowly at the cutoff point, and this causes 'wire drawing' of the steam, another wasteful thermodynamic effect visible on an indicator diagram.|$|E

40|$|Globe valves {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} types of valve used for {{throttling}} applications for all sizes due to better controllability and wider range. One of the major limitations associated with the use globe valves in liquid application is cavitation and it takes place both in part open and in fully open conditions due to varied reasons. There are different designs of globe valves available but for control valve applications, cage and plug designs are widely employed. Cage and plug design consists of body, valve cage, plug and an actuating mechanism. Actuating mechanism is connected to the valve plug which is a moving part, through valve shaft. There are many investigations reported about the flow visualization and numerical simulation of normal type globe valves. But study on valves with cage and plug design are not reported in detail. The objective of the present study is to provide a three dimensional analysis of flow through a globe valve with cage and plug design with emphasis on the inception and development of cavitation in detail. Cavitation reduction is achieved by breaking the flow in the form of more than one liquid jet, thereby increasing the turbulence inside the valve flow path. The numerical simulation was done using GAMBIT to set up geometry and grid and FLUENT to solve difference equation postulated from the conservation of mass and momentum of the fluid in motion. The k-epsilon model was used for turbulence. Results of five configurations of the cage with constant flow areas and <b>valve</b> <b>stroke</b> are presented in this paper. The numerical results were verified with an experimental program employing total flow measurement and pressure drop created by the valve at full opening. The study was conducted for different jet configurations to generalize the results of the study.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a {{computational method}} for optimally allocating dimensional tolerances for an automotive pneumatic control valve. Due {{to the large}} production volume, costly tight tolerances should be allocated only to the dimensions that have high influence to the quality. Given a parametric geometry of a valve, the problem is posed as a multi-objective optimization with respect to product quality and production cost. The product quality is defined as 1) the deviation from the nominal valve design in the linearity of <b>valve</b> <b>stroke</b> and fluidic force, and 2) the difference in fluidic force with and without cavitation. These quality measures are estimated by using Monte Carlo simulation on a Radial-Basis Function Network (RBFN) trained with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the valve operation. The production cost is estimated by the tolerance-cost relationship obtained from the discrete event simulations of valve production process. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is utilized to generate Pareto optimal tolerance allocations with respect to these objectives, and alternative tolerance allocations are proposed considering the trade-offs among multiple objectives. 1...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and test a simple, {{clinically}} practical alternative isovelocity surface (ISVS) model for calculating effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) in mitral regurgitation (MR) when the regurgitant orifice is elongated, such as in functional MR. BackgroundClinical experience and 3 -dimensional imaging suggest that the traditional hemispheric ISVS model used in the conventional proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) calculation is invalid in certain MR cases and can cause erroneous EROA values. MethodsOur ISVS model consisted of 3 sections of equal radius (R) : a cylindrical midsection of length (L) positioned between 2 hemispheroidal end sections. Total ISVS area (TS) is equal to 2 πR 2 + πLR and EROA is equal to (VN/VCW) TS, where VN is the flow velocity crossing perpendicular to the ISVS, and VCW is the peak MR jet velocity by continuous-wave Doppler. This EROA was corrected for any obtuse angle, θ formed by tented leaflets, by multiplying TS by a planar factor, (θ/ 180) or a combination of this planar factor for the cylindrical midsection and the solid-angle factor, 1 −cos(θ/ 2), for the 2 spheroidal end sections. In 24 cases of severe or 3 + functional MR, we calculated EROA using 3 traditional hemispheric surfaces and 3 alternative ISVS models that differed in the leaflet angle correction applied. Results were compared with continuity-based EROA using the standard mitral valve − aortic <b>valve</b> <b>stroke</b> volume method and with predictions based upon theoretical geometric considerations. ResultsThe mean differences between continuity EROA and ISVS area–based EROA for no angle correction, planar correction, or combined angle correction were, respectively, 0. 38, 0. 32, and 0. 28 cm 2 for the 3 spherical surface models and 0. 17, 0. 018, and − 0. 012 cm 2 for the 3 alternative 3 -section ISVS models. The empiric EROA results with both the traditional spherical and alternative ISVS models agreed well with theoretical geometric predictions. ConclusionsThe traditional spherical PISA model underestimates EROA in functional MR. For elongated MR orifices, an ISVS model that mirrors orifice shape yields more accurate EROA values. Correction to the ISVS area for obtuse leaflet angulation improves accuracy of EROA estimation...|$|E

Until the mid-1980s Formula One engines were limited to around 12,000 rpm due to the traditional metal valve springs used to close the valves. The speed required to operate the engine valves at a higher rpm called for ever stiffer springs, which increased the power loss to drive the camshaft and the valves {{to the point where the}} loss nearly offset the power gain through the increase in rpm. They were replaced by pneumatic valve springs introduced by Renault, which inherently have a rising rate (progressive rate) that allowed them to have extremely high spring rate at larger <b>valve</b> <b>strokes</b> without much increasing the driving power requirements at smaller strokes, thus lowering the overall power loss.

40|$|The Rotating Cylinder Valve (RCV) Engine {{is a novel}} 4 {{cycle engine}} that is a {{practical}} alternative to conventional 2 and 4 stroke designs, in particular for small capacity single cylinder applications. It is primarily intended to address applications where emissions legislation is forcing manufacturers to abandon the traditional carburetted 2 stroke. It has particular benefits for the moped/light motorcycle market. The engine operates on a simple principle. The cylinder liner is rotated around the piston at half engine speed via a pair of bevel gears. A port {{in the side of}} this cylinder indexes with inlet and exhaust ports in the surrounding casing. This rotary valve serves the cylinder as the engine cycles through the conventional 4 stroke cycle. The main technical issue that has been addressed is the design of a practical rotary valve seal. The RCV seal design provides a gas-tight compression seal, accommodates large thermal distortions, and takes up both production tolerance and longer term wear. The design is low cost, and simple to assemble and service. The rest of the components within the engine are conventional. The RCV engine offers all the normal emissions advantages that a 4 stroke has over a conventional 2 stroke. It also has many benefits compared to a conventional poppet <b>valve</b> 4 <b>stroke,</b> in particular a predicted production cost comparable to a conventional 2 stroke. The design has other significant technical benefits, including excellent thermal distribution, and good breathing characteristics.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if, in fetuses with normal hearts, the NT thickness is related to cardiac function throughout gestation. Methods The NT was measured in 191 karyotypically/phenotypically normal fetuses with structurally normal hearts and was increased (>= 95 (th) centile) in 104. All fetuses had been referred for fetal echocardiography and were prospectively included between October 1 2003 and April 1 2009. Three-hundred and ten echocardiograms were performed between 11 and 35 weeks' gestation. The E-and A-wave velocity, E/A velocity ratio, E/time velocity integral (TVI) ratio over the atrioventricular (AV) valves, myocardial performance index, acceleration time (AT) and peak velocity over the semilunar <b>valves,</b> <b>stroke</b> volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) as well as the ductus venosus pulsatility index for veins at 11 - 14 weeks' gestation (DV-PIV), were measured. A multilevel analysis was performed using the NT multiples of the median (MoM) as a continuous variable. Results AV-E-and A-wave velocities, E/A velocity ratios, semilunar valve peak velocity, SV, CO and aortic valve (AoV) AT increased significantly with advancing gestation. At 11 - 14 weeks' gestation, the AoV-AT, tricuspid valve (TV) -E/A, TV-E/TVI ratios and DV-PIV increased, and the pulmonary valve (PV) AT decreased, with increasing NT-MoMs. After midgestation, the PV-AT increased and the AoV-AT, TV-E/A and TV-E/TVI ratios decreased with increasing NT-MoMs. Conclusions NT thickness is related to right ventricular diastolic function and semilunar valve AT. Our findings suggest improved first-trimester, but later reduced, right ventricular relaxation and discordant ventricular afterload in fetuses with an increased NT. Copyright (C) 2011 ISUOG.

A cost functional is defined in terms of an integral involving some specified "target function". Integral expressions describing the evolution of the system under the influence of various initial and boundary conditions are given; Butkovskii's Maximum Principle is formally applied to modified forms of these expressions, to give equations determining the optimal control function. Pontryagin's Maximum Principle is applied to a discrete approximation to the distributed system, and a connection is demonstrated between the optimal control thus obtained and that for the distributed system. A further connection is demonstrated with the solution obtained after applying calculus of variations techniques to a notionally unconstrained version of the problem. Difficulties of numerical solution are discussed, and the need for further constraints is pointed out. Solutions to some numerical examples are given. PART II.

An aluminium twin spar frame which reduced frame weight was used, and the engine crankcase was designed to share swing-arm pivot. Through a reduction of internal friction and weight, combined with larger <b>valves,</b> shorter <b>stroke,</b> and a bigger bore, higher revs were enabled. The spark plug caps had Ignition coils built into them. Slightly larger carbs were added and the oil cooler was now located by the oil filter. A new suspension had larger 43 mm forks and used Fireblade parts. The front brakes were upgraded, and the rear rim increased to 5.5” with new 3-spoke wheels. The F4 was fitted with Honda’s HISS engine immobiliser system.|$|R
