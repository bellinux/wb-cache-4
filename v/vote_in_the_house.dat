5|$|In May 1923 the Conservative prime minister, Bonar Law, {{resigned}} {{for health}} reasons. In December his successor, Stanley Baldwin, called another election {{in which the}} Conservatives lost their majority, with Labour in a strong second place. King George V advised Baldwin, {{as leader of the}} largest party, not to resign his office until defeated by a <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{issuance}} of the Churchill White Paper in June 1922, the House of Lords rejected a Palestine Mandate that incorporated the Balfour Declaration by 60 votes to 25, following a motion issued by Lord Islington. The vote proved to be only symbolic as it was subsequently overruled by a <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons following a tactical pivot and variety of promises made by Churchill.|$|E
5|$|Robert Turner {{bought the}} house and lived there from 1758; his son sold it in 1787 to the canon of Wells Cathedral, William Blencowe. John Humphrey Babb leased the house from the early 19th century, {{purchasing}} it outright from the Blencowe family in 1813. Upon his death in 1825, his successor as Deliverer of the <b>Vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons, James Mitchell, moved to the house, living there until his own death in 1833. His widow subsequently sold Highgrove at auction.|$|E

The United States Senate voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27. Only three Senators, all Democrats, voted against Ford's confirmation: Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, Thomas Eagleton of Missouri and William Hathaway of Maine. On December 6, 1973, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35. One hour after the confirmation <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> Ford took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 1942 Driberg {{cast his}} first <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons, {{in support of}} Churchill against a rebel motion of censure on the government's conduct of the war. The rebels' case was put incompetently, which ensured that the motion gained only 25 votes, as against 477 cast for the government. Driberg {{delivered}} his maiden speech on 7 July, in a debate {{on the use of}} propaganda. He called for the lifting of the ban on the Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, which he saw as a potentially valuable weapon of home propaganda.|$|E
5|$|Each of the 338 {{members of}} {{parliament}} in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. General elections must be called by the governor general, either {{on the advice of}} the prime minister, or if the government loses a confidence <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> Constitutionally, an election may be held no more than five years after the preceding election, although the Canada Elections Act limits this to four years with a fixed election date in October. The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75. Five parties had representatives elected to the federal parliament in the 2015 election: the Liberal Party of Canada who currently form the government, the Conservative Party of Canada who are the Official Opposition, the New Democratic Party, the Bloc Québécois, and the Green Party of Canada.|$|E

5|$|Meyer is {{challenged}} {{in the general}} election by Southern Senator Bill O'Brien. The election ends in an Electoral College tie, but with Meyer having won the popular vote. After an ambiguous result in Nevada, the Meyer camp successfully campaigns for a recount. The recount backfires, and O'Brien keeps Nevada as a victory, as well as overtakes the popular vote. Congress must then decide who will be the President. After the House of Representatives fails to elect the President, Meyer agrees to be Vice President for her running mate Tom James, however the Senate instead elects O'Brien's running mate Laura Montez as Vice President. Due to the tied <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> the office of the President is left vacant, meaning that now as Vice President, Montez immediately ascends to the presidency. As a result, James makes plans to return to the private sector while Meyer, now completely out of office, contemplates her future.|$|E
5|$|In the 38th Canadian Parliament Dosanjh was {{appointed}} Minister of Health {{in the federal}} Cabinet. As Health Minister, Dosanjh strongly supported Canada's existing single-tier, publicly funded health-care system. Dosanjh introduced legislation to make cigarettes fire safe, new regulations to further limit lead content in children's jewelry, and supported an NDP motion to ban trans fats. He advocated that Canada ratify the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which they did in November 2004. Dosanjh funded a program to revise the Canada food guide to include more multicultural foods and another program to integrate foreign-trained medical professionals into the health-care system. Supported by a unanimous <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons, the government agreed to compensate the 6,000 Canadians infected with hepatitis C from tainted blood transfusion. Along with Prime Minister Martin, a 10-year, $41 billion funding plan was negotiated with the provinces to deliver health care – with $5.5 billion to specifically address wait times that had been an election issue during the 2004 federal election – but they rejected Premiers' demands for a national program to purchase pharmaceuticals in bulk. As the Minister of Health, Dosanjh introduced Bill C-12 An Act to prevent the introduction and spread of communicable diseases which updated the 1985 Quarantine Act; it was given royal assent in May 2005.|$|E
