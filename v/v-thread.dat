5000|$|The {{theoretical}} triangle {{is usually}} [...] {{to varying degrees}} (that is, {{the tip of the}} triangle is cut short). A <b>V-thread</b> {{in which there is no}} truncation (or a minuscule amount considered negligible) is called a sharp <b>V-thread.</b> Truncation occurs (and is codified in standards) for practical reasons--the thread-cutting or thread-forming tool cannot practically have a perfectly sharp point, and truncation is undesirable anyway, because: ...|$|E

5000|$|Most {{triangular}} threadforms {{are based}} on an isosceles triangle. These are usually called <b>V-threads</b> or vee-threads because of {{the shape of the}} letter V. For 60° <b>V-threads,</b> the isosceles triangle is, more specifically, equilateral. For buttress threads, the triangle is [...]|$|R
50|$|Power screws are {{classified}} by {{the geometry of}} their thread. <b>V-threads</b> are less suitable for leadscrews than others such as ACME because they have more friction between the threads. Their threads are designed to induce this friction to keep the fastener from loosening. Leadscrews, on the other hand, are designed to minimize friction. Therefore, in most commercial and industrial use, <b>V-threads</b> are avoided for leadscrew use. Nevertheless, <b>V-threads</b> are sometimes successfully used as leadscrews, for example on microlathes and micromills.|$|R
50|$|The angle {{characteristic}} of the cross-sectional shape is often called the thread angle. For most <b>V-threads,</b> this is standardized as 60 degrees, but any angle can be used.|$|R
5000|$|Ice climbers {{also use}} the ice itself as protection. The two most common of such {{techniques}} are the <b>V-Thread</b> (also known as the [...] "Abalakov" [...] anchor, named after a Russian climber who popularised the technique) and the ice bollard. In a <b>V-thread</b> two intersecting tunnels are bored into the ice to form a [...] "V" [...] shaped tunnel. A sling or cordelette is then threaded through the V and tied in a loop. The rope is passed through the sling, which remains left behind after use.|$|E
50|$|The common <b>V-thread</b> {{standards}} (ISO 261 and Unified Thread Standard) {{include a}} coarse pitch {{and a fine}} pitch for each major diameter. For example, -13 belongs to the UNC series (Unified National Coarse) and -20 belongs to the UNF series (Unified National Fine). Similarly, ISO261 M10 (10mm (398 thou) nominal outer diameter) has a coarse thread version at 1.25mm pitch (49 thou) and a fine thread version at 1 mm (39 thou) pitch.|$|E
50|$|The {{metal screw}} {{did not become}} a common {{fastener}} until machine tools for their mass production were developed {{toward the end of}} the 18th century. This development blossomed in the 1760s and 1770s along two separate paths that soon converged: the mass production of wood screws screws made of metal to be used in wood in a specialized, single-purpose, high-volume-production machine tool; and the low-count, toolroom-style production of machine screws (<b>V-thread)</b> with easy selection among various pitches (whatever the machinist happened to need on any given day).|$|E
50|$|Long ice-screws are now {{often used}} to create <b>V-threads</b> (a type of thread-hole /ice-bollard). By making two ice-holes that intersect, an {{inexpensive}} but strong cord (typically static climbing accessory cord or tape, made of perlon, Dyneema or Specta) than be threaded through, making a relatively safe and cheap anchor. This can be an attractive option at belays and when ice screws are in short supply. <b>V-threads</b> can be particular useful as rappel or abseil points where it is often necessary to leave the final anchor behind. A piece of wire - typically a piece of old coat hanger shaped for the purpose - or a stiff flexible purpose built tool with a small hook {{at one end and}} a hanging loop at the other end, is {{often used to}} aid threading of the cord.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a development methodology {{for the design}} of concurrent programs that provides a migration path from existing sequential C and Fortran programs. These programs may be executed immediately, without change, using the entire physical memory of a distributed memory machine. Subsequent program refinements may involve data and control decomposition together with explicit message passing to improve performance. Each step in the program development may utilize hardware mechanisms provided by message-driven computers, such as the MIT M-machine. These mechanisms include: tagged pointers, hardware synchronization, global virtual address space, <b>V-threads,</b> and H-threads. Although collectively these concepts are unique to the M-machine, variants of the concepts can be found in other architectures including the Cray T 3 D. The ideas presented in this paper are currently being implemented within the Multiflow compiler which is being targetted for the M-Machine. Although the examples [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The Abalakov thread, or <b>V-Thread,</b> is an ice {{protection}} device named after its innovator, Soviet climber Vitaly Abalakov. The Abalakov thread {{is a common}} method of protecting oneself while ice climbing because {{it is easy to}} create, doesn't require the sacrifice of expensive gear, and can be very safe when used properly. An Abalakov thread is often used in multi-pitch ice climbing routes. Because of its safety and convenience, the Abalakov thread {{is considered one of the}} most significant innovations in ice climbing. It significantly expanded the scope of possible routes and abseiling safety.|$|E
50|$|The use {{of machine}} tools {{began with the}} onset of the First Industrial Revolution. The {{increase}} in mechanization required more metal parts, which were usually made of cast iron or wrought iron—and hand working lacked precision and was a slow and expensive process. One of the first machine tools was John Wilkinson's boring machine, that bored a precise hole in James Watt's first steam engine in 1774. Advances in the accuracy of machine tools can be traced to Henry Maudslay and refined by Joseph Whitworth. Standardization of screw threads began with Henry Maudslay around 1800, when the modern screw-cutting lathe made interchangeable <b>V-thread</b> machine screws a practical commodity.|$|E
50|$|The snow picket {{is used as}} {{an anchor}} in mountaineering. It is driven into the snow and used to arrest falls. Snow pickets can also be placed {{horizontally}} in snow as a deadman, which provides a secure anchor to abseil on. Ice screws can be hand-driven into solid ice and are the equivalent of cams or nuts when ice climbing. Ice can also be protected using an Abalakov thread or <b>v-thread.</b> Because of the uncertain holding power of ice protection, it is sometimes attached to the rope using a load-absorbing sling or quickdraw, designed to reduce the load on protection by extending {{in case of a}} fall.|$|E
5000|$|A {{perfectly}} sharp 60° <b>V-thread</b> {{will have}} a depth of thread ("height" [...] from root to crest) equal to [...]866 of the pitch. This fact is intrinsic to the geometry of an equilateral triangle—a {{direct result of the}} basic trigonometric functions. It is independent of measurement units (inch vs mm). However, UTS and ISO threads are not sharp threads. The major and minor diameters delimit truncations {{on either side of the}} sharp V, typically about one eighth of the pitch (expressed with the notation 1/8p or [...]125p), although the actual geometry definition has more variables than that. This means that a full (100%) UTS or ISO thread has a height of around [...]65p.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, {{the first}} {{historically}} important intra-company standardization of screw threads began with Henry Maudslay around 1800, when the modern screw-cutting lathe made interchangeable <b>V-thread</b> machine screws a practical commodity. During the next 40 years, standardization continued to {{occur on the}} intra- and inter-company levels. No doubt many mechanics of the era participated in this zeitgeist; Joseph Clement {{was one of those}} whom history has noted. In 1841, Joseph Whitworth created a design that, through its adoption by many British railroad companies, became a national standard for the United Kingdom called British Standard Whitworth. During the 1840s through 1860s, this standard was often used in the United States and Canada as well, in addition to myriad intra- and inter-company standards. In April 1864, William Sellers presented a paper to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, proposing a new standard to replace the US' poorly standardized screw thread practice. Sellers simplified the Whitworth design by adopting a thread profile of 60° and a flattened tip (in contrast to Whitworth's 55° angle and rounded tip). The 60° angle was already in common use in America, but Sellers's system promised to make it and all other details of threadform consistent.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Clinical {{success of}} implant {{prosthodontics}} is dependent in part upon {{the type of}} implant thread design. The selection of implant thread design {{plays an important role}} in the outcome of the treatment. This study was undertaken to evaluate the pattern of stress distribution using a finite element analysis; hence, the area which would be bearing maximum load for a given design would be arrived. Materials and Methods: Three implants with different thread designs, namely <b>V-thread,</b> buttress, and reverse buttress thread designs were considered and dimensions were standardized. The site considered was the mandibular molar region with cortical and trabecular bone assuming to be isotropic and homogeneous. The implant modeling was done with the CATIA software. Vertical loads of 100 N were applied. The stresses were calculated as Von Mises stress criterion. Results: Maximum stresses were seen at the cortical bone and were transferred to the implant. Minimum Von Mises stresses were seen with reverse buttress thread design at the cortical bone. The stresses were observed least at the cancellous bone and maximum at the implant. Conclusion: Hence, within the limitations of this study the results obtained can be applied clinically for appropriate selection of implant thread design for a predictable success of implant therapy...|$|E
