40|$|Nondestructive {{evaluation}} of the structural integrity of shaft and tunnel concrete linings {{is the focus of}} this thesis. A nondestructive testing system was assembled based on the principle of miniature seismic reflection (MSR). The MSR system consists of spherical tip impactors and a pair of vertical and tangential displacement transducers. Mechanical impact causes generation of stress P- and S-waves in the test object. The elastic waveforms undergo multiple reflections between {{the top and bottom of}} the testing layer. The surface displacements are captured by a vertical and tangential displacement transducer. The signals are transformed from time domain waveforms to frequency spectra. The <b>vertical</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>transducer</b> is sensitive to normal surface displacements and the highest amplitude peak on the computed frequency spectrum is related to the resonance of the P-wave between the top and the bottom layer. Similarly, the tangential displacement transducer is sensitive to the horizontal surface displacements, and the maximum peak value in the generated frequency spectrum corresponds to the resonance of the S-wave between the two layers of the testing object. Thus, knowing the thickness of the given layer, as well as the measured frequencies, allows P- and S-wave velocities to be calculated. Alternatively, if the thickness is unknown, the time-distance graph of the primary surface wave arrivals can be used to calculate the P-wave velocities and, subsequently, the thickness of the layer. The MSR response depends on the material properties of the testing object. The elastic wave velocities can be used to calculate directly the dynamic elastic properties of the test object. In this study, simulated fractures and steel reinforcement bars were detected and located using the reflected P-waves. In addition, the changes in elastic properties of various types of concrete mixes were monitored for a 28 -day curing period. The MSR elastic constants were then compared with dy...|$|E

The instrumented couplers were used to measure the in-train forces. The <b>displacement</b> <b>transducers</b> were arranged to determine the relative movement in the train and coupler system. The accelerometers were also installed on the carbody to measure the braking deceleration. The indirect method for the wheel–rail force measurement was adopted to obtain the wheel unloading ratio [15]. It was indicated that the pitch motion of train and couplers only occurred under compressed coupler forces. Consequently, the pitch motion of the carbody generated a <b>vertical</b> <b>displacement</b> between adjacent carbodies, which further led to geometric interference of in-train devices.|$|R

40|$|The {{traffic safety}} of a railway bridge is {{generally}} evaluated by levels of structural responses such as acceleration, <b>vertical</b> <b>displacement,</b> and deck twist. Whereas acceleration can be readily measured in general, acquiring displacement and twist responses in field testing is often a challenging task {{due to lack of}} appropriate sensors. As most existing <b>displacement</b> <b>transducers</b> are designed to measure at a single location, the deck twist which is calculated from four displacements requires costly and labor-intensive sensor instrumentation. To effectively address the issue, this study proposes an integral strategy for the traffic safety evaluation of railway bridges using multisensor data. The proposed approach provides a formulation to estimate the dense displacement necessary for obtaining twist responses using acceleration and strain measurements. Wireless sensors are adopted because of their intrinsic advantages in multimetric sensing of heterogeneous data, convenient sensor instrumentation, and high-fidelity time-synchronized data acquisition. The proposed approach for dense displacement estimation is numerically and experimentally validated using beam models. Subsequently, a full-scale experiment on a railway bridge is conducted to evaluate the traffic safety for high-speed trains at three different speeds of 280 km/h, 300 km/h, and 400 km/h. The acceleration, <b>vertical</b> <b>displacement,</b> and twist are obtained and compared with design limits to determine the traffic safety of the railway bridge. clos...|$|R

The data show a clear development of shaft friction with the applied load and also some unexpected pile–soil slip within two of the soil layers, which is attributed {{to the development of a}} filter cake due to the long construction time.

40|$|Monitoring systems {{currently}} {{applied to}} concrete bridges include strain gauges, inclinometers, accelerometers and <b>displacement</b> <b>transducers.</b> In general, <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> {{are one of}} the parameters that more often need to be assessed because their information reflects the overall response of the bridge span. However, the implementation of systems to continuously and directly observe <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> is known to be difficult. On the other hand, strain gauges and inclinometers are easier to install, but their measurements provide no more than indirect information regarding the bridge deflection. In this context, taking advantage of the information collected through strain gauges and inclinometers, and the processing capabilities of current computers, a procedure to evaluate bridge girder deflections based on polynomial functions is presented. The procedure has been implemented in an existing software system - MENSUSMONITOR -, improving the flexibility in the data handling and enabling faster data processing by means of real time visualization capabilities. Benefiting from these features, a comprehensive analysis aiming at assessing the suitability of polynomial functions as an approximate solution for deflection curves, is presented. The effect of boundary conditions and the influence of the order of the polynomial functions on the accuracy of results are discussed.

The relative slip for loading procedure was used the values measured by the <b>displacement</b> <b>transducers</b> located in the front side.

We compared the estimated reduction in COM <b>vertical</b> <b>displacement</b> due to the determinants in their compass model with the actual reduction of <b>vertical</b> <b>displacement.</b> The maximum height of the COM for the compass gait model occurred earlier than the actual COM maximum height. Different gait functions were determinant in reducing COM <b>vertical</b> <b>displacement.</b> In both cases heel rise was the main determinant (up to 2 / 3 of total reduction). Pelvic obliquity and single stance knee flexion contributions were more important when compass gait COM maximum was used while they were barely detectable at the actual COM maximum. Ipsi- and contra-lateral knee flexion were detrimental to the reduction of COM <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements,</b> while pelvic rotation contribution was beneficial and accounted for up to 10 % of the overall COM <b>vertical</b> <b>displacement</b> reduction.

40|$|In {{consideration}} {{of the difficulty of}} monitoring internal deformation in dam model tests, a new optical fiber sensor based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) technology has been developed. Quasi-distributed FBGs are installed on a slender bar (circular cross-section) along axial direction to make an FBG sensing bar. For the dam physical model in this study, FBG sensing bars can be embedded in predrilled holes within the dam structure and the dam foundation. When the dam is loaded by hydraulic jacks and dam deformations occur, the sensing bar works like an elastic beam under arbitrary transverse and axial loading. According to the bending beam theory, the distribution of both horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> can be calculated from the strains measured by the FBGs. The two sensing bars used in the test were calibrated in the laboratory before testing. The calibration results have shown that the displacements measured by the sensing bars were in good agreement with those obtained using other conventional gauges. Recently a two-dimensional gravity dam model was constructed and instrumented with two embedded FBG sensing bars, together with surface mounted <b>displacement</b> <b>transducers</b> and strain rosettes. In the overload test, all the sensors were used to perform real-time monitoring of the model dam deformation. Major monitoring results are presented, compared and analyzed. The displacements measured by the FBG sensing bars in the dam model test are in good agreement with those from <b>displacement</b> <b>transducers.</b> The test results also reveal the deformation mechanism and failure mode of the gravity dam. 考虑到大坝模型试验中内部变形难以监测的现状,研制了一种新型的基于光纤布拉格光栅(FBG) 技术的光纤传感器。这种传感器为圆棒式结构,其表面沿轴向安装了准分布式的光纤布拉格光栅。对于大坝物理模型,该传感器可预埋入坝体和坝基的内部。当大坝受到油压千斤顶荷载产生变形时,该传感器类似于一根一端固定并同时受轴向拉、压和横向弯曲的弹性梁。根据弯梁原理,由光纤布拉格光栅测得的应变结果可反算出大坝沿水平向和竖向的位移分布。室内标定试验结果表明,该传感器测得的变形量与其他常规传感器的读数一致。在一个二维混凝土重力坝物理模型的超载破坏试验中,采用预埋于坝体、坝基内部的光纤传感器以及表面安装式位移计、电阻应变花对该模型进行实时的变形监测。试验结果验证了该光纤传感器在大坝模型内部变形监测中的有效性,同时也揭示了大坝在超载作用下的变形机制和破坏形态。Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

In laboratory, the small strain behavior is examined by different techniques including the bender element method for measuring the maximum shear modulus and local <b>displacement</b> <b>transducer</b> (LDT) for measuring Young's modulus at small strains. However, most commonly used LDTs are based on electrical components and have limitations, such as electromagnetic interference and possibility of short circuit in the presence of water. To overcome these limitations, in the present study, a conventional triaxial apparatus has been modified to measure and study the stress-strain behavior of soils at small strains. The major modifications include addition of piezoceramic sensors (bender elements) for measuring the maximum shear modulus and fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor-based local <b>displacement</b> <b>transducers</b> (FBG-LDTs) for measuring the stress-strain behavior at small strains.
