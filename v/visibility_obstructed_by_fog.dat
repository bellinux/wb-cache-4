The situation of the Shinsengumi is recorded at this time as [...] "The war and tear on the 21st, total of Yamaguchi Jirō's Shinsengumi, officer, infantryman, leads 120 or more to Shougunzan". It is described in [...] "Wakamatsu-ki Soukou" [...] ("Account draft of Wakamatsu") Because the New Government Army made a surprise attack {{at the rear of the}} Shinsengumi whose view was <b>obstructed</b> <b>by</b> <b>fog,</b> Saitō retreated to Inawashiro district. Although Saitō meets Kuroda Denta a Nihonmatsu Taishi, at Tanima Hosomichi and both head towards Aizu, he separates in response to the attack of the New government army.

50|$|In 1878, the United States Congress {{appropriated}} $50,000 for {{a lighthouse}} {{to be built}} on Tillamook Head; however, after a survey was conducted, {{it was determined that}} due to the height of the Head (1,000 feet), the light would be <b>obstructed</b> <b>by</b> <b>fog,</b> and the Tillamook rock was selected as the alternative site for the construction. A survey of the rock was ordered in 1879, which was headed by H. S. Wheeler and his cutter Thomas Corwin. Wheeler's initial assessment determined that access to the rock was severely limited, if not impossible, but was ordered to continue. During his second assessment, he was able to land on the rock, but was unable to move his survey equipment without the use of a tape line. He then relayed that the rock would need considerable blasting to create a level area in order lay down a foundation for the lighthouse, and that more money was going to be needed to complete the project.|$|R
2500|$|Communication {{with the}} rear broke down again, as German artillery-fire cut {{telephone}} wires and visual signalling was <b>obstructed</b> <b>by</b> the <b>fog,</b> until about [...] Pigeons and runners carried a few messages and at [...] the divisional commander Major-General Shea, ordered {{a line from}} Maltz Horn Farm to {{the west side of}} Guillemont to be consolidated and held at all costs. In the afternoon, the party at the orchard withdrew with difficulty and troops on the Hardecourt–Guillemont road fell back later. On the right flank, the British held on around Maltz Horn Farm, as German infantry advanced through British heavy artillery fire on Leuze Wood, the crossroads east of Guillemont and Ginchy. Artillery-fire on Guillemont was impossible, because of the British party still holding out; all the British reserves had been committed, which left none to reinforce the troops in the village, who were overwhelmed around [...] On the left flank, the 2nd Division attacked with the 5th Brigade, from Waterlot Farm to Guillemont railway station, with protective machine-gun fire from Delville Wood on the left. Many German machine-gun posts were undamaged and few British troops crossed the German front-line to reach the vicinity of the station, where they were shot down, the survivors of the two battalions eventually being withdrawn, through a German bombardment. In the heat of the afternoon, the two brigades of the 30th Division reorganised and the 89th Brigade consolidated the only captured ground still held, from the French boundary near Maltz Horn Farm to the Hardecourt–Guillemont road and Arrow Head Copse. During the night the 30th Division and 35th Division were relieved by the 55th Division.|$|R
