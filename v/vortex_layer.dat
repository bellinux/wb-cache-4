40|$|International audienceA 2 D {{numerical}} simulation {{of the flow}} around a circular cylinder is investigated during the onset of unsteadiness {{within the range of}} Reynolds numbers between 50 and 400. Using the recent formulation of Wu, Lu and Zhuang [J. Fluid Mech. 576, (2007) ], the fluid force is successfully approximated by a volume integral of a force density over a small flow domain surrounding the cylinder. The domain does contain neither the detached vortices in the wake nor the vortex formation region. Using the vorticity laplacian, the domain is dynamically divided into two regions: the external flow region containing the two separated <b>vortex</b> <b>layers</b> and the back-flow region between these two <b>vortex</b> <b>layers.</b> The integration of the force density on either the separated <b>vortex</b> <b>layers</b> or the back-flow region gives two instantaneous contributions to the total force. For the mean drag it is found that the back-flow contribution increases from almost 0 % of the total drag at Re = 50 to 20 % of the total drag at Re = 400. The separated <b>vortex</b> <b>layers</b> contribution is found to decrease as (a + bRe − 1 / 2). Concerning the force fluctuations, both regions contribute similarly to the lift oscillations, while only the back-flow region is responsible for the drag oscillations. This alternative comprehension of the fluid force origin is discussed and compared to that of the classical pressure/viscous formulation...|$|R

The solution of the governing equations in the vorticity-velocity form allows for accurate application of boundary conditions. The physics of the evolution is investigated {{with an emphasis on}} the mechanisms that influence the transport of axial and angular momentum. Excitation of normal mode instabilities gives rise to coherent large scale helical structures inside the vortical core.

A typical racing car wing geometry is tested in a rolling road wind tunnel {{over a wide range}} of incidences and ride heights. Rectangular vane type of sub-boundary <b>layer</b> and large-scale <b>vortex</b> generators are attached to the suction surface, comprising counter-rotating and corotating configurations. The effects of both device height and spacing are examined. The counter-rotating sub-boundary <b>layer</b> <b>vortex</b> generators and counter-rotating large-scale vortex generators suppress the flow separation at the center of each device pair while the counter-rotating large-scale vortex generators induce horseshoe vortices between each device where the flow is separated The corotating sub-boundary <b>layer</b> <b>vortex</b> generators tested here show little evidence of separation control. Increasing the spacing of the counter-rotating sublayer vortex generator induces significant horseshoe vortices, comparable to those seen in the counter-rotating large-scale vortex generator case. Wake surveys show significant spanwise variance behind the wing equipped with the counter-rotating large-scale vortex generators, while the counter-rotating sub-boundary <b>layer</b> <b>vortex</b> generator configuration shows a relatively small variance in the spanwise direction.

40|$|Particulate {{turbulent}} flows are {{encountered in}} many natural and industrial situations. In the present study, we numerically investigate how {{the dynamics of}} particle-laden homogeneous shear turbulence depends on the particle size and solid-to-fluid density ratio in order to deepen {{the understanding of the}} interaction between particles and turbulent shear flows. We consider the situation where the particle diameter is five to ten times larger than the Kolmogorov scale of turbulence with a solid-to-fluid density ratio between 0. 5 and 10. An immersed boundary method is adopted to represent the spherical finite-size particle. Numerical results show that small particles enhance the viscous dissipation inside viscous layers surrounding particles, which leads to the suppression of the growth of homogeneous shear turbulence. The viscous dissipation is further enhanced through the modification of turbulence structure. The enhancement of the viscous dissipation depends strongly on the solid-to-fluid density ratio as well as particle size. In the cases of high density ratio, the generation of vortex tubes is activated around the particles, which leads to the modification of <b>vortex</b> <b>layers</b> and the enhancement of the viscous dissipation...|$|R

40|$|Flow {{separation}} control using vortex generators on {{an inverted}} wing {{in ground effect}} is experimentally investigated, and its performance is characterized in terms of forces and pressure distributions over a range of incidence and ride height. Counter-rotating and co-rotating rectangular-vane type vortex generators are tested on the suction surface of the wing. The effect of device height and spacing is investigated. The counter-rotating sub-boundary <b>layer</b> <b>vortex</b> generators and counter-rotating large-scale vortex generators on the wing deliver 23 % and 10 % improvements in the maximum downforce, respectively, compared with the clean wing, at an incidence of one degree, and delay {{the onset of the}} downforce reduction phenomenon.

40|$|We {{consider}} incompressible Euler {{flows in}} terms of the stream function in two dimensions and the vector potential in three dimensions. We pay special attention to the case with singular distributions of the vorticity, e. g., point vortices in two dimensions. An explicit equation governing the velocity potentials is derived in two steps. (i) Starting from the equation for the stream function [Ohkitani, Nonlinearity 21, T 255 (2009) ], which is valid for smooth flows as well, we derive an equation for the complex velocity potential. (ii) Taking a real part of this equation, we find a dynamical equation for the velocity potential, which may be regarded as a refinement of Bernoulli theorem. In three-dimensional incompressible flows, we first derive dynamical equations for the vector potentials which are valid for smooth fields and then recast them in hypercomplex form. The equation for the velocity potential is identified as its real part and is valid, for example, flows with <b>vortex</b> <b>layers.</b> As an application, the Kelvin-Helmholtz problem has been worked out on the basis the current formalism.

40|$|An {{integral}} equation is derived for the velocity {{on the surface}} of a given body of revolution or a given symmetrical profile in longitudinal flow, using the generation of a body by a <b>vortex</b> <b>layer</b> on its surface. The equation can be solved by the usual iteration method for linear {{integral equation}}s of the second kind. The method of generating a body by a <b>vortex</b> <b>layer</b> leads to formulae expressing the components of the velocity outside the body by means of its pressure distribution. In general, the numerical work is greater for this method than for the indirect methods which use essentially a generation of the body by a distribution of sources and sinks on its axis. On the other hand, the method is not restricted to the case in which the analytic continuetion of the flow into the interior of the body does not meet singularities outside the axis. The only requirement is that the shape of the body must have a continuous tangent, whereas its curvature may have isolated discontinuities. Numerical examples are given for the two-dimensional case of a semi-infinite plate of constant thickness with a semi-circular leading edge, and for the three-dimensionM case of a semi-infinite cylinder with three different heads (hemispherical, 2 caliber ogival and ~ caliber rounded).
