Participants were 101 commercial drivers who operated vans, pickups, and other light trucks. The driver could escape or avoid the delay by fastening his or her safety belt before shifting out of park. Unbelted participants experienced either a constant delay of 8 seconds, or a <b>variable</b> <b>delay</b> of 8 seconds on average. A 16-second delay was introduced for those U.S. drivers who did not show significant improvement. Safety belt use increased from 48% to 67% for U.S. drivers and from 54% to 74% for Canadian drivers.

[...] This effect is now done electronically using DSP, but originally the effect was created by playing the same recording on two synchronized tape players, and then mixing the signals together. [...] As long as the machines were synchronized, the mix would sound more-or-less normal, but if the operator placed his finger on the flange of one of the players (hence [...] "flanger"), that machine would slow down and its signal would fall out-of-phase with its partner, producing a phasing effect. [...] Once the operator took his finger off, the player would speed up until its tachometer was back in phase with the master, and as this happened, the phasing effect would appear to slide up the frequency spectrum. [...] This phasing up-and-down the register can be performed rhythmically.|$|E

Although wave variable technique is proven to track position demands successfully under constant time delays given {{that there is no}} communication failure, position tracking performance also degrades under <b>variable</b> <b>delays.</b> In this paper, two components are presented to be used with the customary wave variable technique to stabilize the system and enhance the position tracking performance under <b>variable</b> time <b>delays.</b> The proposed controller is then applied to an identical master-slave teleoperation configuration which qualifies as a limited-workspace teleoperation system.
