5|$|Likewise, the Eskayan speech variety {{has been}} {{associated}} with languages as disparate as Hebrew, Greek, and Etruscan. Recent studies have revealed that the syntax of Eskayan is <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> to that of Boholano-Visayan, lending weight to the theory that Eskayan is actually an auxiliary variety of this language.|$|E
5|$|The F-84C {{featured}} {{a somewhat more}} reliable J35-A-13 engine and had some engineering refinements. Being <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> to the F-84B, the C model suffered {{from all of the}} same defects and underwent a similar structural upgrade program in 1949. All F-84Cs were withdrawn from active service by 1952.|$|E
5|$|The two battleships of the Nevada-class were <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> {{except in}} their propulsion. Nevada {{and her sister}} were fitted with {{different}} engines to compare the two, putting them 'head-to-head': Oklahoma received older vertical triple expansion engines, which had proven more fuel-efficient and reliable than the direct drive turbines of some earlier battleships, while Nevada received geared Curtis steam turbines.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{molecular}} clock estimation, Trigonognathus {{is thought to}} have originated around 41 million years ago during the Middle Eocene, {{as part of a larger}} evolutionary radiation of etmopterid genera. The genus is represented in this time period by the extinct species T. virginiae, whose fossilized teeth have been recovered from Lutetian age (47.8–41.3 Mya) strata in Landes, southwestern France. Fossil teeth <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> to those of the modern viper dogfish are known from the Cubagua Formation in northeastern Venezuela, which dates to the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene (11.6–3.6 Mya).|$|E
5|$|Dragon Age: Origins {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from major video game critics upon its release. While {{the game is}} considered to be <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> across all platforms, differences in user interface, graphical performance, and online content delivery have led the PC version to be reviewed more favorably than the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions; Metacritic ranks the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 versions of the game with scores of 91, 87, and 86, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Niobium is {{slightly}} less electropositive and more compact {{than its predecessor}} in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas it is <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, {{as a result of}} the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table. Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, the lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications, such as vat linings in chemical plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Jumping Flash! 2 is <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> to its predecessor; {{the game}} is presented in a first-person perspective, and the player can move freely in three-dimensional world and rotate the camera in any direction. The user interface resembles much {{of the characteristics of}} its predecessor; the top part of the screen shows the time remaining, the player's score, and one of four of Robbit's AI sidekicks who offers the player warnings, reminders and hints.|$|E
5|$|The third disc from Integral was {{released}} as a stand-alone game in North America {{under the title}} of Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions on September 23, 1999. While the content of VR Missions are <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> to Integrals VR Disc, the unlocking requirements for the Ninja missions and the photoshoot mode were changed accordingly so {{that they no longer}} required save data from the main game or any use of the PocketStation.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria calvescens {{is rather}} similar in appearance, {{and can only}} be {{reliably}} distinguished from A.gallica by observing microscopic characteristics. A.calvescens has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the Great Lakes. A.mellea has a thinner stem than A.gallica, but can be more definitively distinguished {{by the absence of}} clamps {{at the base of the}} basidia. Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. Molecular methods have been developed to discriminate between the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1-alpha.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{another study}} was {{published}} describing the integument and dermis of Psittacosaurus sp., {{from two different}} specimens. The skin remains could be observed by a natural cross-section to compare them to modern animals, showing that dinosaurian dermal layers evolved in parallel to those in many other large vertebrates. The collagen tissue fibres in Psittacosaurus are complex, <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> to all other vertebrates in structure but having an exceptional thickness of about forty layers. As the sections of dermis were collected from the abdomen, where the scales were eroded, the tissue may have assisted with the musculature of the stomach and intestines and offered protection against predators.|$|E
5|$|It remains {{close to}} the Interstate Highway for about , {{intersecting}} NY237 {{less than a mile}} (1.6km) north of the overpass taking that highway over the Thruway, but leaves it behind for good shortly thereafter as it turns even more to the north, taking it into the town of Bergen and the small village of the same name in the county's northeast corner. Here, NY33 crosses NY19, a long north–south route. Shortly afterward, NY33A begins to the east while the main route turns to the north yet again and becomes Buffalo Road. Just east of this point, NY33A connects to I-490, which briefly runs along the Monroe County line through this area. From the west end of NY33A to the county line, NY33 and I-490 follow <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> northeasterly alignments.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair's {{licensing}} agreement with Timex enabled the American company to produce three clones or offshoots of Sinclair machines for the US market. These were the Timex Sinclair 1000, Timex Sinclair 1500 (both variants of the ZX81) and the Timex Sinclair 2068 (a {{variant of the}} ZX Spectrum). The TS1000 was launched in July 1982 and sparked a massive surge of interest; at one point, the Timex phoneline was receiving over 5,000 calls an hour, 50,000 a week, inquiring about the machine or about microcomputers in general. It was <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> to the ZX81 save for re-branding {{and the addition of}} an extra 1 KB of memory, making for a grand total of 2 KB. In the five months following the TS1000's launch, the company sold 550,000 machines, earning Sinclair over $1.2 million in royalties.|$|E
5|$|The I-5 and the I-6 were <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> in performance, {{although}} the I-6 took 15 seconds {{to complete a}} full circle versus the 9.5 seconds of the I-5. Both aircraft were armed with two 7.62mm (0.3in) PV-1 machine guns, but the production model of the I-5 {{was expected to be}} armed with four, although this proved to impose too great a penalty to the I-5's performance. The exact reasons for the selection of the I-5 over the I-6, which was debated for a full year, are not known, but likely relate to both of these factors. Curiously, Polikarpov was not informed of the selection of the I-5 until his release in 1933 after his initial sentence of death had been commuted to ten years of imprisonment in a labor camp.|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} {{has generally}} nocturnal habits and {{spends much of}} the day buried in the substrate. It has been known to follow the rising tide to forage in water barely deep enough to cover its body. This species preys upon small invertebrates, including crustaceans, annelid worms, and bivalve and gastropod molluscs, and bony fishes. It mainly targets benthic and burrowing organisms, but also opportunistically takes free-swimming prey. In Delaware Bay, this species feeds predominantly on the shrimp Cragon septemspinosa and the blood worm Glycera dibranchiata, and its overall dietary composition is <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> to that of the roughtail stingray (D.centroura), with which it shares the bay. The bluntnose stingray is preyed upon by larger fishes such as the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas). Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium brevissime and Kotorella pronosoma, the monogenean Listrocephalos corona, and the trematodes Monocotyle pricei and Multicalyx cristata.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{paper on}} the affinities of Gondwanatheria, Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck argue that the {{difference}} in shape between MACN-RN 975 and Argentodites is due to extensive wear on the former specimen; they write that {{the parts of the}} p4 that are not worn are <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> to the equivalents parts of the Argentodites p4. In addition, MACN-RN 975 is said to have as many ridges as Argentodites and to be of approximately similar size—about 15% larger. They allocate MACN-RN 975 to the gondwanathere Ferugliotherium and consequently, they argue that Argentodites most likely represents either Ferugliotherium or some related species. In the same year, Guillermo Rougier and colleagues also suggested ferugliotherian affinities of Argentodites in a {{paper on the}} mammals of the Allen Formation, another Cretaceous rock unit of Argentina. Ferugliotherium is a gondwanathere from Late Cretaceous Argentinean deposits. Gondwanatheres are a small and enigmatic group from the late Cretaceous and Paleogene of South America, Antarctica, Madagascar, India, and perhaps Tanzania. Although the evolutionary affinities of gondwanatheres are controversial, both teams that identified Argentodites as gondwanathere believe gondwanatheres are likely themselves multituberculates or closely related to them.|$|E
5|$|The stylized {{treatment}} {{of her hair}} could represent a ceremonial wig. She wears a single broad necklace, composed of squares that are structured with horizontal and vertical lines, possibly depicting beads, four to each square. This necklace is <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> to the necklace of the god found at Ur, except that the latter's necklace has three lines to a square. Around both wrists she wears bracelets which appear composed of three rings. Both hands are symmetrically lifted up, palms turned towards the viewer and detailed with visible life-, head- and heart lines, holding two rod-and-ring symbols of which only {{the one in the}} left hand is well preserved. Two wings with clearly defined, stylized feathers in three registers extend down from above her shoulders. The feathers in the top register are shown as overlapping scales (coverts), the lower two registers have long, staggered flight feathers that appear drawn with a ruler and end in a convex trailing edge. The feathers have smooth surfaces; no barbs were drawn. The wings are similar but not entirely symmetrical, differing both in the number of the flight feathers and in the details of the coloring scheme.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} of Belgium varied little over the period. Belgium's border with the Netherlands {{was almost the}} same as that which had been created after the Dutch Revolt in the early 17th century, and its western border was almost the same as those of the 18th-century polities the Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Liège. It was only after the French annexation of 1795 that the territory became a single entity. In the 1830s, Belgian revolutionaries sought to create an independent state within the borders of the nine provinces that had been established under French occupation while ending the traditional roles of the small duchies, princedoms and counties which had traditionally been the basic territorial units. Aside from Zeelandic Flanders, part of Luxembourg, and Northern Limburg, which were ceded to the Dutch to compensate for the loss {{of the rest of the}} territory, the outline of Belgium in 1914 was <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> to that established by the French in 1795. The three ceded territories had a total of 300,000 inhabitants at the time.|$|E
5|$|The town's {{inhabitants}} {{paid the}} price for this neglect in September 1540 when Barbary pirates from North Africa carried out a major raid, {{taking advantage of the}} weak defenses. Hundreds of Gibraltar's residents were taken as hostages or slaves. The Spanish crown responded to Gibraltar's vulnerability by building the Charles V Wall to control the southern flank of the Rock. The wall's builder, the Italian engineer Giovanni Battista Calvi, also strengthened the Landport Gate. Another Italian engineer, Giovan Giacomo Paleari Fratino, extended the wall onto the Upper Rock at some point probably between 1558–65. A lookout tower, one of several constructed along Spain's southern coast during this period, was built at the eastern end of the isthmus linking Gibraltar with the Spanish mainland. This structure, known as Devil's Tower, was demolished during World War II. The German engineer Daniel Specklin is also thought to have been employed in improving Gibraltar's fortifications between 1550–52. Although there is no direct evidence, the Spanish fortifications {{at the southern end of}} the town are <b>virtually</b> <b>identical</b> in design to drawings in Specklin's posthumously published Architectura von Vestungen ("The Architecture of Fortresses") and on this basis it has been suggested that he was the designer of Gibraltar's southern works.|$|E
