The <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Identification</b> Number (VIN) is unchanged from the Enzo from which it was derived.

40|$|A {{low-profile}} antenna {{installed on}} the road surface for RFID-enabled vehicle communication is presented. The antenna in this application operates as on-road sensor for <b>vehicles</b> <b>identification.</b> To that end, the antenna is required to have an elevated toroid-shaped radiation, so that the reader can easily interrogate an RFID-enabled vehicle license. The antenna is designed using a capacitive-loaded inverted-F radiator, which has an omnidirectional radiation in the azimuth plane. To adjust the radiation pattern to the required elevation above the road surface, and isolate the radiation {{from the effects of}} variable road conditions, a corrugated ground plane with perturbed surface impedance is used underneath the radiator. The antenna 2 ̆ 7 s configuration is verified by full-wave finite difference time domain simulations with various road surface conditions. A prototype antenna is then developed and tested in realistic field scenarios as on-road sensor for <b>vehicles</b> <b>identification.</b> The results show that the antenna possess more than 15 dB return loss, more than 1. 5 dBi gain, vertical polarization, and desirable radiation pattern from 880 to 960 MHz, which is the standard band licensed for RFID-enabled plates. The antenna also successfully communicates with an RFID-enabled vehicle registration plate...|$|R

There are no automatic protection devices, but the cars have track brakes, giving the ability to stop quickly under control of the operator. Interlockings are controlled through a wayside Automatic <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Identification</b> (AVI) system that relies on the operator properly entering the destination manually on a roto-wheel in the train cab at the beginning of a run.|$|E

25|$|Mario Cardullo's device, {{patented}} on January 23, 1973, was {{the first}} true ancestor of modern RFID, {{as it was a}} passive radio transponder with memory. The initial device was passive, powered by the interrogating signal, and was demonstrated in 1971 to the New York Port Authority and other potential users and consisted of a transponder with 16 bit memory for use as a toll device. The basic Cardullo patent covers the use of RF, sound and light as transmission media. The original business plan presented to investors in 1969 showed uses in transportation (automotive <b>vehicle</b> <b>identification,</b> automatic toll system, electronic license plate, electronic manifest, vehicle routing, vehicle performance monitoring), banking (electronic check book, electronic credit card), security (personnel identification, automatic gates, surveillance) and medical (identification, patient history).|$|E
25|$|The Red, Orange, and Blue {{lines have}} block {{signalling}} systems that make tracking {{the location of}} trains easier. Signs in most station on those lines began to display real-time train information in late 2012 and early 2013, while data feeds have been available for smartphone applications since 2010. However, the wayside signalling system used in the Green Line's tunnels and the D Branch does not provide for that level of tracking, nor do the basic stop/go signals used on the street-level branch lines. In January 2013, the MBTA announced plans to provide full tracking data for the Green Line by 2015, allowing use of smartphone applications and in-station countdown signs. The $13.4 million system is funded by MassDOT; it uses existing Automatic <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Identification</b> (AVI) systems plus additional sensors in the tunnels, and GPS receivers on the surface sections.|$|E

The investigators traced the SUV's last registered owner, and the female college student who sold the suspect the Pathfinder. Law enforcement officials recovered the suspect's pre-paid disposable cell phone's number from the cell phone of the seller, and ran it through a number of databases. They determined that the disposable phone had been used for calls to and from a Pakistani telephone number which they knew to be associated with Faisal Shahzad. The phone had also been used to call a fireworks store in rural Pennsylvania. They collected his e-mail address from an email which he sent to the seller’s computer.|$|E

We are proposing a real time application which recognizes license plates from vehicles to track the vehicle path. It {{is very difficult to}} identify the lost vehicle and also the vehicles which violate traffic rules. It is not possible to track the vehicle, by the user because {{they may not be able}} to identify the number from the moving vehicle. Therefore, it is necessary to capture the number plate of the vehicle and use this captured number to track the path of the vehicle. In order to track the path we need to extract number from the captured image, using JAVA OCR-libraries. Number plate identification is helpful in finding stolen <b>vehicles,</b> <b>identification</b> of <b>vehicle</b> in traffic etc [...] ...|$|R
