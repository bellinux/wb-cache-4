Methods: We constructed a pulsatile flow model filled with human blood at varying hematocrit (15 %, 35 %, and 55 %) and corresponding blood viscosity (blood/water viscosity: 2. 6, 4. 8, 9. 1) levels in which jets were driven through a known orifice (7 mm(2)) into a 110 mL compliant receiving chamber (compliance: 2. 2 mL/mmHg) by a pulsatile pump. In addition, we used variable pump stroke volumes (5, 7. 5, and 10 mL) and rates (40, 60, and 80 ppm). <b>Vena</b> <b>contracta</b> region was imaged using a 3. 5 MHz transducer.

30|$|In {{single-phase}} fluid flow, {{the theoretical}} analysis to evaluate pressure drop caused by abrupt contraction {{of the flow}} area is accomplished with one-dimensional analysis. We begin by considering the orifice restriction case: as a fluid stream passes through a sharp edge “thin” orifice restriction, the flow contracts to an area smaller {{than that of the}} orifice itself. This smaller area, A c, is called the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> (Van Ness and Abbott 2008). As fluid converges toward the opening of an orifice, it builds up considerable inward radial momentum that causes the flow stream to continue to flow “inwards” for a distance downstream of the restriction (Darby 2001; Sahin and Ceyhan 1996). As the flow stream continues downstream of the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> the flow expands in an irreversible process to the pipe cross-sectional area, A. Correspondingly, the pressure of the flow stream decreases across the restriction and continues to decrease to the point of the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta,</b> with some recovery of pressure occurring as the flow stream expands outward to the pipe cross-sectional area.|$|R

BACKGROUNDColor Doppler imaging of the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> {{has emerged as a}} simple and reliable measure of the severity of valvular regurgitation. This study evaluated the accuracy of VC imaging of AR by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). METHODSA transit-time flow probe was placed on the ascending aorta during cardiac surgery in 24 patients with AR. The flow probe was used to measure RgF and RgV simultaneously during VC imaging by TEE. Flow probe and VC imaging were interpreted separately and in blinded fashion. RESULTSA good correlation was found between VC width and RgF (r = 0. 85) and RgV (r = 0. 79). All six patients with VC width > 6 mm had a RgF > 0. 50. All 18 patients with VC width 7. 5 mm 2 had a RgF > 0. 50, and all 18 patients with a VC area < 7. 5 mm 2 had a RgF < 0. 50. In a subset of nine patients who underwent afterload manipulation to increase diastolic blood pressure, RgV increased significantly (34 ± 26 ml to 41 ± 27 ml, p = 0. 042) while VC width remained unchanged (5. 4 ± 2. 8 mm to 5. 4 ± 2. 8 mm, p = 0. 41).

At 3 months, sheep were randomized to sham surgery versus isolated undersized annuloplasty versus isolated bileaflet chordal cutting versus the combined therapy (n 7 each).

The hydraulic {{characteristics of the}} 36 -inch wide by 25 -foot long fishway were evaluated at various bottom slopes and headpond elevations. Fishway discharge versus upstream headpond elevation rating curves were established. Numerical equations were derived to predict fishway flow discharge {{as a function of}} the headpond elevation at various slopes. The 36 -inch wide fishway, with 48 -inch high walls, passed a maximum of 20. 3, 21. 9, 23. 0, and 23. 3 f 3 /s at floor slopes of 1 : 10, 1 : 8, 1 : 6, and 1 : 4, respectively (1 being in the vertical direction). These flows corresponded to a headpond elevation of 42 -inches (measured from the fishway bottom to the water surface just upstream of the fishway). Higher headpond elevations caused water to spill over the sides of the fishway. Flow discharge can be determined from the derived equation; by substituting for the headpond elevation above the fishway floor, measured just upstream of the fishway or in the exit channel, and knowing the slope of the fishway bottom. Flow velocities at various cross sections along the fishway were documented. These remained relatively unchanged within the fishway downstream of the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> region (the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> region was within the top two to three upstream baffles).

The recent availability of real time 3 D ultrasound posesseveral interesting challenges and opportunities, {{and the work of}} thisthesis is devoted to both challenges and opportunities. One of the key benefits of {{ultrasound imaging}} is that its images arereal time. This has been challenged with the recent introduction of 3 Dimages, where the number of ultrasound beams is squared compared totraditional 2 D images. One common way to alleviate this is byreceiving several closely spaced ultrasound beams from each pulsetransmission, which increases acquisition speed but affects the imagequality. Specifically, B-mode images are irregularly sampled and losespatial shift invariance while a bias in the Doppler velocityestimates causes a discontinuity in the velocity estimates in colorflow images. We have found that these artifacts can be reducedsignificantly by interpolation of the beamformed data from overlappingbeams, with the limitation of requiring at least twice the number ofbeamformers. We have also found that valvular regurgitation is one of thecardiac diseases that can benefit greatly from quantification ofseverity using 3 D ultrasound. We have devised a modality that useshigh pulse repetition frequency 3 D Doppler to isolate thebackscattered signal power from the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> of a regurgitantjet. This measure is calibrated with a narrow reference beam insidethe jet to estimate the cross-sectional area of the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta.</b> Wehave validated this method with computer simulations, with an in vitrostudy and finally in vivo with 27 patients who had mitralregurgitation. We found that the cross-sectional area and regurgitantvolume of the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> could be quantified without bias as long as the orifice was sufficiently large for a calibration beam tofit inside it. The severity of smaller regurgitations will beoverestimated, but this does not pose a clinical problem, as thesepatients can easily be identified by standard 2 D Doppler examination and donot typically need further quantification. Finally, we have developed a new, fast 3 D ultrasound simulation methodthat can incorporate anisotropic scattering from cardiac muscle cells. This approach is three orders of magnitudefaster than the most commonly used simulation methods, making it wellsuited for the simulation of dynamic 3 D images for development and testingof quantitative diagnostic methods such as 3 D speckle tracking andvolumetric measurements.

It is also used to flush the reservoir of sediments and to control the elevation of the reservoir. Low-level outlet works typically consist of a gate that controls the flow within a closed conduit that runs through the dam and an air vent that supplies air behind the gate. In the absence of properly designed air vents, negative pressures may develop downstream of the gate. These negative pressures could potentially lead to cavitation and vibration damage. Properly sized air vents help maintain the downstream air pressure at or near atmospheric pressure and/or provide air to absorb the energy generated by cavitation, reducing the potential for damage. The {{majority of}} research done on air vent sizing is for dams having large dam geometry, which consist of a pressurized conduit leading to a vertical slide gate that is followed by a discharge tunnel. The typical air vent design for these large dams uses the water flow rate and the Froude number measured at the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> downstream of the gate. The low-level outlet works for small-to-medium-sized embankment dam geometries typically have an inclined slide gate, installed at the inlet on the upstream face of the dam slope, followed by an elbow that connects to a conduit that passes through the dam and discharges downstream.

Measurements of static pressure, mean velocity and turbulence intensity are presented for a typical high contraction ratio nozzle. These show two distinct flow regimes which can be described very simply by the Reynolds form of the Navier-Stokes equations...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted at}} the NACA Lewis laboratory to obtain pressure-drop data for flow of air with no heat addition through mockups of two reactor segments of the proposed General Electric Company aircraft reactor. Pressure-drop data were obtained over a range of Reynolds numbers from 4000 to 80, 000, air inlet Mach numbers from 0. 02 to 0. 40, inlet pressures up to about 40 inches of mercury absolute, and ambient air temperatures. factors, corrected for entrance, <b>vena</b> <b>contracta,</b> momentum, and exit losses, are considerably higher at the high Reynolds numbers than those reported for turbulent flow in smooth pipes...|$|R
40|$|Decisions {{regarding}} {{surgery for}} mitral regurgitation (MR) are {{predicated on the}} accurate quantification of MR severity. Quantitative parameters, including <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> width, regurgitant volume and fraction, and effective regurgitant orifice area have prognostic significance and are recommended to be obtained from patients with more than mild MR. New tools for MR quantification have been provided by 3 -dimensional echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and cardiac computed tomography, but limited guidance on appropriate image acquisition and post-processing techniques has hindered their clinical application and reproducibility. This review describes optimal image acquisition and post-processing methods for quantification of MR...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental method for validating traditional compressor valve theory for unsteady flow conditions. Traditional valve theory considers the flow force {{acting on the}} plate and the flow rate as quasi-steady variables. These variables are related via semi-empirical coefficients which are determined by steady flow experiments. The new experimental methodology permitted the simultaneous measurement of instantaneous valve opening, instantaneous volume-flow rate and instantaneous pressure difference across the valve. Results for an oscillating valve (at 1. 9 times the valve resonance frequency) show that the gas force is predicted reasonably accurately. However, the flow rate model should be improved in order to predict the observed hysteresis (30 %) and fluctuations in the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> factor...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} echocardiographic predictors of outcome in patients with advanced heart failure (HF) due to severe left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction in the Beta-blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST). BackgroundPrevious studies indicate that echocardiographic measurements of LV size and function, mitral deceleration time, and mitral regurgitation (MR) predict adverse outcomes in HF. However, complete quantitative echocardiograms evaluating all of these parameters have not been reported in a prospective randomized clinical trial in the era of modern HF therapy. MethodsComplete echocardiograms were performed in 336 patients at 26 sites and analyzed by a core laboratory. A Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used to determine which echocardiographic variables predicted the primary end point of death or the secondary end point of death, HF hospitalization, or transplant. Significant variables were then entered into a multivariable model adjusted for clinical and demographic covariates. ResultsOn multivariable analysis adjusted for clinical covariates, only LV end-diastolic volume index predicted death (events = 75), with a cut point of 120 ml/m 2. Three echocardiographic variables predicted the combined end point of death (events = 75), HF hospitalization (events = 97), and transplant (events = 9) : LV end-diastolic volume index, mitral deceleration time, and the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> width of MR. Optimal cut points for these variables were 120 ml/m 2, 150 ms, and 0. 4 cm, respectively. ConclusionsEchocardiographic predictors of outcome in advanced HF include LV end-diastolic volume index, mitral deceleration time, and <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> width. These variables indicate that LV remodeling, increased LV stiffness, and MR are independent predictors of outcome in patients with advanced HF...|$|R
