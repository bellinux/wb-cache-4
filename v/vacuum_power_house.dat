5000|$|A {{vacuum system}} {{can be used for}} power transmission, {{although}} the maximum power that can be transmitted to a vacuum motor is less than conventional pneumatics. There is an optimum pressure for the operation of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>power</b> transmission system, of around 0.4bara (8 psig), as Downie also shows. Although less efficient than pneumatics, it can be perfectly workable. For example a 22mm (7/8") pipe on vacuum can transmit as much power on 0.4 bara (8 psig) as a 6mm (1/4") pipe on 8bara (100 psig). The system is efficient enough that Boulton and Watt used <b>vacuum</b> <b>power</b> transmission in their factory. They called the vacuum main in the factory the ‘spirit pipe’.|$|R

50|$|The Chicago and North Western Railway <b>Power</b> <b>House</b> is the {{historic}} <b>power</b> <b>house</b> which served the 1911 Chicago and North Western Terminal in Chicago, Illinois. The building {{was designed by}} Frost & Granger in 1909; it was mainly designed in the Beaux Arts style but also exhibits elements of the Italian Renaissance Revival style. Construction on the building finished in 1911, the same year the terminal opened. The irregularly shaped building borders Clinton Street, Milwaukee Avenue, Lake Street, and the former Chicago and North Western tracks, which are now used by Metra. The <b>power</b> <b>house</b> was built in cream brick with terra cotta trim, cornices, and ornamentation; {{the corner of the}} house at Clinton and Milwaukee features a 227 ft brick smokestack. The building contained four rooms, a large engine room and boiler room and a smaller engineer's office and reception room. The Chicago Tribune reported in 1948 that the <b>power</b> <b>house</b> output enough <b>power</b> to serve a city of 15,000 people.

30|$|Field {{monitoring}} {{has been}} taken in generator unit # 4 of Dagangshan Hydropower Station. Two monitoring holes has been constructed, and the splitting phenomenon of the rock masses between the main <b>power</b> <b>house</b> and transformer chamber has been monitored through the borehole TV, sliding extensometer and WDA- 1 deformation resistivity instrument. According to the displacement monitoring results, the displacement of the rock masses decreases with {{the distance between the}} main <b>power</b> <b>house</b> and transformer chamber increasing at the beginning, and when the distance is over 41  m, the displacement is increasing again. The maximum displacement near the main <b>power</b> <b>house</b> is 18.53  mm (2  m away {{from the surface of the}} downstream sidewall of the main <b>power</b> <b>house),</b> and that near the transformer chamber is 4.08  mm (5  m away from the surface of the upstream sidewall of the transformer chamber). The monitoring result also shows that the depth of the splitting zone of downstream sidewall of main <b>power</b> <b>house</b> is larger than that of upstream sidewall.

30|$|Since {{the large}} {{size of the}} main <b>power</b> <b>house,</b> {{significant}} disturbing effect on the surrounding rock is caused by excavations of the main <b>power</b> <b>house.</b> Therefore, the displacement of the key points near the downstream surface of the main <b>power</b> <b>house</b> is much larger than that near the upstream surface of the transformer chamber. According to the field monitoring, the maximum displacement of surrounding rock, 18.53  mm, as measured near {{the surface of the}} downstream sidewall of the main <b>power</b> <b>house.</b> The displacement of surrounding rock masses decreases with the distance {{from the surface of the}} downstream sidewall of the main <b>power</b> <b>house</b> to the key points. The displacement curve has a turning point when the distance between the monitoring points and the main workshop is approximately 15  m. After that, the descending of displacement is becoming insignificant, whereas the displacement is approaching a constant. The displacement of surrounding rock masses begins to be gradually increased when the monitoring points from the surface of the downstream sidewall of the main <b>power</b> <b>house</b> is approximately 41  m that is 5  m from the surface of the upstream sidewall of the transformer chamber. The displacement curve reaches a peak when the monitoring point from the surface of upstream sidewall of the transformer chamber is approximately 2  m away. After the completion of excavation for the eighth step of main <b>power</b> <b>house,</b> the maximum displacement measured at this position is 4.08  mm.|$|R
