The loss of the <b>vessel</b> would not make a breach of containment inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E

5|$|Once {{dissection}} has occurred, two mechanisms {{contribute to}} the development of stroke symptoms. Firstly, the flow through the blood <b>vessel</b> may be disrupted due to the accumulation of blood under the <b>vessel</b> wall, leading to ischemia (insufficient blood supply).

From various lines of evidence, it appears that thrombosis and embolism is the predominant problem.|$|E

5|$|Small lymphatic {{networks}} called plexuses exist beneath each of {{the three}} layers of the heart. These networks collect into a main left and a main right trunk, which travel up the groove between the ventricles that exists on the heart's surface, receiving smaller vessels as they travel up. These vessels then travel into the atrioventricular groove, and receive a third <b>vessel</b> which drains the section of the left ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. The left <b>vessel</b> joins with this third <b>vessel,</b> and travels along the pulmonary artery and left atrium, ending in the inferior tracheobronchial node. The right <b>vessel</b> travels along the right atrium and the part of the right ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. It usually then travels in front of the ascending aorta and then ends in a brachiocephalic node.|$|E
