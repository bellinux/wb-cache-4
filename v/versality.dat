40|$|We {{continue}} our investigation of <b>versality</b> for parametrized families of linear retarded functional differential equations (RFDEs) projected onto finite-dimensional invariant manifolds. In this paper, we consider RFDEs equivariant {{with respect to}} the action of a compact Lie group. In a previous paper (Buono and LeBlanc, to appear in J. Diff. Eqs.), we have studied this question in the general case (i. e. no a priori restrictions on the RFDE). When studying the question of <b>versality</b> in the equivariant context, it is natural to want to restrict the range of possible unfoldings to include only those which share the same symmetries as the original RFDE, and so our previous results do not immediately apply. In this paper, we show that with appropriate projections, our previous results on versal unfoldings of linear RFDEs can be adapted to the case of linear equivariant RFDEs. We illustrate our theory by studying the linear equivariant unfoldings at double Hopf bifurcation points in a D_ 3 -equivariant network of coupled identical neurons modeled by delay-differential equations due to delays in the internal dynamics and coupling...|$|E

Matherial and methods: From 1985 to 2009 {{a total of}} 125 male patients (mean age 62, 5 years, range 37 to 74) underwent orhotopic ileal bladder substitute at the urological Clinic in Belgrade. Of these, 8 patients underwent modified technique with serous lined extramural ureteral reimplantation. The median follow-up (available for 88 patients) period was 30 (2 - 72) months.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{families of}} dynamical systems having invariant tori that carry quasi-periodic motions. Our {{interest is the}} persistence of such tori under small, nearly-integrable perturbations. This persistence problem is studied in the dissipative, the Hamiltonian and the reversible setting, {{as part of a}} more general KAM theory for classes of structure preserving dynamical systems. This concerns the parametrized KAM theory as initiated earlier and further developed. The corresponding nondegeneracy condition involves certain (trans-) <b>versality</b> conditions on the normal linear, leading, part at the invariant tori. We show that as a consequence, a Cantor family of Diophantine tori with positive Hausdorff measure is persistent under nearly-integrable perturbations. This result extends the above references since presently the case of multiple Floquet exponents is included. Our leading example is the normal 1 :− 1 resonance, which occurs a lot in applications, both Hamiltonian and reversible. As an illustration of this we briefly describe the Lagrange top coupled to an oscillator. ...|$|E
