5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less reflective {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which could indicate {{that one of}} its sides has a higher surface temperature. On this darker, warmer side, sublimation rates of its icy surface would also be higher, causing more water vapor to be released into the atmosphere. This process would ultimately produce more hydrogen, which might explain the aforementioned <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> Callisto's atmospheric hydrogen levels.|$|E

Young pups act aggressively to one another, while breeding females may show similar aggression to males.|$|E

Yet, making robots that acquire a {{mirroring}} property is crucial {{in order to allow}} them to efficiently cooperate with humans. Inspired by behavioral and computational studies on the MNS, we hypothesize that <b>variances</b> <b>in</b> motions would facilitate their emergence. Experiments showed that human-like motions, which means with <b>variances</b> <b>in</b> motions, lead to stronger connections between robot’s motor commands and other’s motions (i. e., MNS). It demonstrates the importance of <b>variances</b> <b>in</b> motions for the development of cognitive functions. I...|$|R

Even for the same variance, if higher moments of the offspring number distribution exceed those of the binomial distribution then again the force of genetic drift is substantially weakened.|$|E

30|$|The {{significance}} of the observed <b>variances</b> <b>in</b> γ and R between the two subsets (R 1 and R 2) of the XW dataset (Table  1) had been tested. We randomly subdivide the 12, 524 landslides into two subsets with 6, 297 and 6, 227 landslides respectively for 1, 000 times. The results show that, all the differences in parameters observed between the R 1 and R 2 subsets is statistical significant at a significant level of 0.05, except for the difference in rollover estimated using the double Pareto distribution (− 2.51), which has a significant level of about 0.21. Therefore, from the conservative point of view, we attribute the observed <b>variances</b> <b>in</b> rollover to random processes but suggest a physical explanation for the <b>variances</b> <b>in</b> power exponent.|$|R

5|$|The size of {{the brain}} and a person's {{intelligence}} are not strongly related. Studies tend to indicate small to moderate correlations (averaging around 0.3 to 0.4) between brain volume and IQ. The most consistent associations are observed within the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, the hippocampi, and the cerebellum, but these only account for a relatively small amount of <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> IQ, which itself has only a partial relationship to general intelligence and real-world performance.|$|E
5|$|A {{central point}} of debate on GWA studies {{has been that}} most of the SNP {{variations}} found by GWA studies are associated with only a small increased risk of the disease, and have only a small predictive value. The median odds ratio is 1.33 per risk-SNP, with only a few showing odds ratios above 3.0. These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This heritable variation is known from heritability studies based on monozygotic twins. For example, it is known that 80-90% of <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> height can be explained by hereditary differences, but GWA studies only account for a minority of this variance.|$|E

5|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the secondest common {{cancer in the world}} and the commonest amongst women, as well as being amongst the ten commonest chronic {{diseases}} of women, and a substantial contributor to loss of quality of life (Gronowski and Schindler, Table IV). Globally, it accounts for 25% of all cancers. In 2016, breast {{cancer is the}} commonest cancer diagnosed amongst women in both developed and developing countries, accounting for nearly 30% of all cases, and worldwide accounts for one and a half million cases and over half a million deaths, being the fifth commonest cause of cancer death overall and the second in developed regions. Geographic variation in incidence is the opposite of that of cervical cancer, being highest in Northern America and lowest in Eastern and Middle Africa, but mortality rates are relatively constant, resulting in a wide <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> case mortality, ranging from 25% in developed regions to 37% in developing regions, and with 62% of deaths occurring in developing countries.|$|E
5|$|Other {{factors that}} broaden the main {{sequence}} band on the HR diagram include {{uncertainty in the}} distance to stars {{and the presence of}} unresolved binary stars that can alter the observed stellar parameters. However, even perfect observation would show a fuzzy main sequence because mass is not the only parameter that affects a star's color and luminosity. Variations in chemical composition caused by the initial abundances, the star's evolutionary status, interaction with a close companion, rapid rotation, or a magnetic field can all slightly change a main-sequence star's HR diagram position, {{to name just a few}} factors. As an example, there are metal-poor stars (with a very low abundance of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium) that lie just below the main sequence and are known as subdwarfs. These stars are fusing hydrogen in their cores and so they mark the lower edge of main sequence fuzziness caused by <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> chemical composition.|$|E

The most common type is the normal or standard, which is allowed <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> coarseness between the sexes; males have a coarse, thick, rough coat, while females' coats are softer and finer. Other standardized coats include: rex, in which all the hairs are curly, even the whiskers; velveteen, a softer variation of the rex; satin or silky coat, which is extra-soft and fine, with a sheen; and Harley, characterized by wispy long straight hairs. Remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself, but rather by the lack of it, such as hairless rats.|$|E
40|$|Education {{is often}} {{found to be}} a strong {{determinant}} of ethnic prejudice. However, there is preliminary evidence that this educational effect varies across countries. Moreover, there are also theoretical arguments to expect cross-national <b>variances</b> <b>in</b> the educational effect on ethnic prejudice. From both a cultural and structural perspective, we set out to explain these cross-national <b>variances</b> <b>in</b> the educational effect. Results of multilevel analyses on data from 11 European countries show that the cultural perspective is more fruitful to explain cross-national <b>variances</b> <b>in</b> the strength of the educational effect on ethnic prejudice than the structural perspective: a country’s democratic tradition and degree of religious heterogeneity are important for the strength of the educational effect on ethnic prejudice, whereas a country’s ethnic composition and unemployment rate are less relevant. ...|$|R

In the 2009 description of Levnesovia, Hans-Dieter Sues and Alexander Averianov found that Protohadros occupied an intermediate position relative to Altirhinus and Probactrosaurus, being the sister group of Fukuisaurus (results reproduced below). Meanwhile, {{in accordance with}} the results of Horner and colleagues, Albert Prieto-Márquez and Mark Norell found in 2010 that Eolambia was instead the sister group of Protohadros. He also noted features of Eolambia that were convergent upon hadrosaurids: the presence of a single tooth carina; the nearly-square outer corner of the predentary; and the midpoint of the quadratojugal notch (which articulates with the quadratojugal) being located roughly halfway up the surface of the quadrate (being located less than 60% of the bone's height down from the top). In 2012, Holtz classified Eolambia as a primitive member of the Styracosterna along with Altirhinus.|$|E
