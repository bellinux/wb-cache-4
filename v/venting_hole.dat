40|$|The {{development}} of a gas sampler for a miniaturized ambient ammonia detector is described. A micromachined channel system is realized in glass and silicon using powder blasting and anodic bonding. The analyte gas is directly mixed with purified water, dissolving the ammonia that will dissociate into ammonium ions. Carrier gas bubbles are subsequently removed from the liquid stream through a <b>venting</b> <b>hole</b> sealed with a microporous water repellent PTFE membrane. A flow restrictor is placed at the outlet of the sampler to create a small overpressure underneath the membrane, enabling the gas to leave through the membrane. Experiments with a gas flow of 1 ml min– 1, containing ammonia concentrations ranging from 9. 4 ppm to 0. 6 ppm in a nitrogen carrier flow have been carried out, at a water flow of 20 µl min– 1. The ammonium concentration in the sample solution is measured with an electrolyte conductivity detector. The measured values correspond with the concentration calculated from the initial ammonia concentration in the analyte gas, the fifty times concentration enhancement due to the gas–liquid volume difference and the theoretical dissociation equilibrium {{as a function of}} the resulting pH. ...|$|E

Cemented arthro-plasty caused greater and more prolonged embolic cascades than did uncemented arthroplasty. Some emboli {{were more than}} 3 cm in length. In some patients the cascades were associated with pulmonary hyper-tension, diminished oxygen tension and saturation, {{and the presence of}} fat and marrow in aspirates from the right atrium. J BoneJoint Surg [Br] 1994; 76 -B: 409 - 12. Received 7 September 1993; Accepted 22 October 1993 Embolic phenomena have been detected by transoesopha-geal echocardiography during medullary reaming of the long bones (Wenda et al 1989; Pell et al 1993 a) and during hip and knee replacement (Heinrich et al 1985; Parmet et al 1993). Hypotensive episodes (Charnley 1970; Jones 1975), hypoxaemia (Kallos 1975) and sudden death (Burgess 1970) are well-recognised complications of cemented arthroplasty. Increased pulmonary artery pres-sure has also been documented (Samii et al 1980; Byrick, Kay and Mullen 1987) and presumably results from vasoactive substances or medullary embolic cascades reaching the pulmonary circulation during cement inser-tion. It has been reported recently (Ries et al 1993) that pulmonary shunt values increased by 28 % during total hip arthroplasty when the femoral component was inserted using cement but did not change when cement was not used.

40|$|Background: Many {{different}} surgical {{techniques have}} been described for the internal fixation of extracapsular hip fractures. Objectives: To compare different aspects of surgical technique used in operations for internal fixation of extracapsular hip fractures in adults. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (January 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Controlled Trials, orthopaedic journals, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. Date of last search was January 2008. No language restriction was applied. Selection criteria: All randomised and quasi-randomised trials investigating operative techniques used in operations {{for the treatment of}} extracapsular hip fractures in adults. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Wherever appropriate, data were pooled. Main results: Predominantly older people with trochanteric fractures were treated in the 11 included trials. One trial (65 participants undergoing fixation with a fixed nail-plate) found no statistically significant differences between osteotomy versus anatomical reduction. Four trials, involving 465 participants undergoing fixation with a sliding hip screw (SHS), compared osteotomy versus anatomical reduction. Osteotomy was associated with an increased operative blood loss and length of surgery. There were no statistically significant differences for mortality, morbidity or measures of anatomical deformity. Two trials (138 participants) compared SHS fixation of a trochanteric hip fracture augmented with cement against a standard fixation. There were no reoperations even for the four cases of fixation failure in the cement group. The cement group had significantly better quality of life scores at six months. One trial (200 participants) comparing compression versus no compression of a trochanteric fracture in conjunctionwith SHS fixation found {{no significant differences between the}} two groups. One trial (120 participants) found a tendency to improved outcomes with a hydroxyapatite coated lag screw, but none reached statistical significance. One trial (19 participants) reported reduced temperatures when using a modified reaming method. Another trial (50 participants) found reduced bone marrow intravascular embolism, detected by oesophageal ultrasound, when a Gamma nail was inserted with a distal pressure <b>venting</b> <b>hole</b> in the femur. Authors' conclusions: There is inadequate evidence to support the use of osteotomy for internal fixation of a trochanteric hip fracture. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of the other techniques examined in the trials included in this review...|$|E

40|$|Polypropylene {{is one of}} the {{thermoplastic}} {{that can}} be used undergo thermoforming process. Thermoforming process is a process that changes form of thermoplastic sheet from flat surface to dimensional shape. There are three types of thermoforming process. In this project, vacuum process had been chosen to change the shape of flat thermoplastic sheet. Thermoplastic can be formed any shape by undergo heating process using specific heat temperature and its can return to the solid shape upon cooling. Polypropylene (PP) had been choose to be main raw material to form plastic container. The properties of PP sheet are lower density, higher softening point depend on thickness and good resist to fatigue issue. Therefore, the main objective on this project is to prepare plastic container using own fabricated thermoforming machine.

With the help of SAM treatment, the operating voltage is lowered from 30 volts to 13 volts. The load deflection method is then used to measure the effective thickness of the composite diaphragm. The flexible parylene diaphragm can be deflected up to 100 μm when 150 Torr of pressure is applied.

40|$|Polypropylene is in a {{category}} of thermoplastic polymer resin. It {{is a part of}} both the average household and is in commercial and industrial applications. This plastic is regularly used for food containers because it needs to be dishwasher safe. Although the thermoforming process has been developed for over two decades but there are still some unsolved problems found in this technology. In the development commercial polypropylene grades, there are several critical problems addressed such as sheet quality, part uniformity and wall thickness, regrind use and dimensional stability. This project starts with searching various types of journal that related to the topic of designing and fabricating thermoplastic container using polypropylene (PP) sheet via thermoforming process. Read and understand all the journals are the element in the effort to make this project. This study aims to design and fabricate plastic container using polypropylene (PP) sheet with thickness 1 mm via thermoforming process. CATIA P 3 V 5 R 21 software by Dassault Systemes was used to design the plastic container and its mould. Design consideration for the plastic product and its mould is important as to reduce the defects. For example fillet was added to avoid sharp edge. Draft angle also was used at the wall side of mould which is to ease the process of absorption. Round shape plastic container was selected to be design as it has smooth shape that allows the pliable polypropylene sheet to form according to the shape of the mould. An aluminum block with dimension 100 mm x 100 mm x 50 mm was used as the female cavity been cut using band saw machine. The aluminum blocks was machined using Makino KE 55 CNC Milling Machine located at the Machining Laboratory. High Speed Drilling machine was used to drill the hole {{at the bottom of the}} female mould. 1 mm and 6 mm diameter of drill bits was used to make the holes at the bottom of aluminum mould. Moreover, this project studies the effect of thermoforming temperature and number of mould <b>vent</b> <b>hole</b> to 1 mm PP sheet. Two types of <b>vent</b> <b>holes</b> used on the aluminum mould which are 1 vent and 5 <b>vent</b> <b>holes.</b> There were two parameters used to fabricate polypropylene plastic container. The first parameter is the different degree of temperature used to heat the 1 mm polypropylene plastic sheet. The degree of temperature used is 160 °C, 165 °C, 170 °C, and 175 °C. The second parameter that was used is different number of <b>vent</b> <b>holes</b> on the mould to fabricate the plastic container.
