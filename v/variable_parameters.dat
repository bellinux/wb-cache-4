A design method of anti-windup <b>variable</b> <b>parameter</b> PD controller was proposed. The proportional coefficient and derivative coefficient {{were designed to}} be Gauss functions of system tracking error.

This method not only restrained effectively the saturation problem, but also produced enough control force to drive system outputs to track their commands speedily.

We addressed attentional modulation of effective connectivity using <b>variable</b> <b>parameter</b> regression and functional magnetic resonance imaging. We present data from a single subject scanned under identical stimulus conditions (visual motion) while varying only the attentional component of the task. <b>Variable</b> <b>parameter</b> regression {{of the influence of}} V 5 on PP revealed increased effective connectivity during attention to visual motion. With this dynamic measure of effective connectivity we were able to make inferences about the source of modulation by looking for regions that predicted the observed changes in connectivity. Using an ordinary regression analysis, we showed that activity in the prefrontal cortex could explain these changes and was sufficient to account for these modulatory influences on connections in the dorsal visual pathway.

50|$|A {{statistical}} {{model is a}} probability distribution function proposed as generating data. In a parametric model, the probability distribution function has <b>variable</b> <b>parameters,</b> such as the mean and variance in a normal distribution, or the coefficients for the various exponents of the independent variable in linear regression. A nonparametric model has a distribution function without parameters, such as in bootstrapping, and is only loosely confined by assumptions. Model selection is a statistical method for selecting a distribution function within a class of them, e.g., in linear regression where the dependent variable is a polynomial of the independent variable with parametric coefficients, model selection is selecting the highest exponent, and may be done with nonparametric means, such as with cross validation.|$|E
50|$|After {{simulating}} {{the soil}} moisture, the saturation and Hortonian infiltration excess for vegetated and bare soil are computed {{to generate the}} surface runoff for each sub-basin. Philip's equation is used to compute the infiltration capacity of soil, and the surface runoff is distributed temporally using a time lag response function obtained from a reference rainfall excess of 1 cm depth applied to each grid cell within the sub-basin for one time step. Then for each grid cell, which has {{the resolution of the}} digital elevation model (DEM) used, the flow is routed according to the kinematic wave equation from cell to cell based on eight possible flow directions until the total runoff water for the sub-basin is completely routed. The resulting runoff becomes a lateral inflow to the stream channel within the sub-basin and these flows are routed through the drainage network by the Muskingum-Cunge routing method whose <b>variable</b> <b>parameters</b> are evaluated by an iterative four point approach.|$|E

The helium scatters from the experimental sample and is detected {{at the end of the}} beamline after another spin-filtering stage (analyser). Before and after the scattering process, the beam passes through magnetic fields that precess the probe spins in the usual sense of a spin echo experiment.
