50|$|An {{overlapping}} gene is a gene whose expressible nucleotide sequence partially overlaps with the expressible nucleotide sequence of another gene. In this way, a nucleotide sequence {{may make a}} contribution to the function of one or more gene products. Overprinting refers to a type of overlap in which {{all or part of the}} sequence of one gene is read in an alternate reading frame from another gene at the same locus. Overprinting has been hypothesized as a mechanism for de novo emergence of new genes from existing sequences, either older genes or previously non-coding regions of the genome. Overprinted genes are particularly common features of the genomic organization of viruses, likely to greatly increase the number of potential expressible genes from a small set of <b>viral</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E

What proportion of cells in lymphoblastoid lines transformed by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 1 contain sufficient <b>viral</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> to code for infectious viral particles and, by inference, contain the entire EB viral genome?

Both questions were approached by deriving single cell clones of human and monkey lymphoblastoid lines known to be producers of infectious virus detectable by the transformation assay. All daughter clones of human lymphoblastoid cell lines express EB viral capsid antigens, provided that the parent line also contains these antigens (2 - 4). Therefore at least sufficient <b>viral</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> to code for capsid antigens is present in all cells, even though these antigens are demonstrable in less than 10 % of human cells at any given time.

40|$|English Abstract Shortly {{after the}} {{identification}} of HIV as a causative agent of AIDS, an aspartic protease was identified in the <b>viral</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>information.</b> The very same time protease {{has become one of}} the dominant therapeutical targets in AIDS therapy. The introduction of protease inhibitors into the antiretroviral therapy has led to a significant improvement in the quality and length of life of HIV patients. However, the virus is still able to effectively prevent the impact of an inhibitor via generating inhibitor-resistant mutated protease variants. Thus, there is a constant need for novel types of inhibitors that would be capable of effectively blocking these resistant variants and simultaneously not supporting the development of novel resistant viral strains. One way to identify such inhibitors could be searching for compounds interacting with the enzyme at different sites than the active cavity, via the mechanisms of noncompetitive or uncompetitive inhibition. The group of compounds called metallacarboranes - inorganic compounds consisting of carbon, boron, hydrogen and metall ion - were shown to exhibit such an activity against HIV- 1 protease. However, for further optimization of these inhibitors, detailed biophysical investigation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex is needed. This work focuses on the [...] ...|$|E
