40|$|Jan Saudek is {{an internationally}} renowned, yet academically {{unexplored}} photographer who makes staged, {{black and white}} (but often hand-coloured) photographs: obviously arranged, and erotically charged, images of the naked, semi-naked or dramatically costumed body. In this paper I present the work of Saudek, especially his performative self-portraits, and discuss the question of desire and subjectivity in relation to these images.

2500|$|Hegenberger {{attempted}} to check wind drift by launching smoke bombs (carried for that purpose) over the tail, but was hindered by glare.

5000|$|The convention, {{according}} to the Interridge Database, is to name vent sites when they are <b>visually</b> <b>confirmed.</b> When a hydrothermal plume was discovered in 2009 (published in 2010) {{in the area of}} the Beebe Vent Field, the field which that plume originated from was pre-emptively called the Piccard hydrothermal vent field before the exact location of that field was known. When the vent site was <b>visually</b> <b>confirmed</b> later in 2010, it was named Beebe. This convention exists for a reason. When a plume is discovered, it can be difficult to know from which vent site that plume actually originated, and likewise, when a vent site is found it can't be known for sure which plume it created. So, there is no real certainty that the vent site which was discovered in 2010 is the [...] "Piccard" [...] site - if it were later to turn out not to be, then this would be a large error. Instead, it is better to name vent sites only when you know exactly where they are, which means <b>visually</b> <b>confirming</b> them. This break from convention has led to some confusion in the literature, with some publications referring to the site as Piccard, and some as Beebe. At this point, it is known for certain (by visual comparison and navigation) that the papers using these different names refer to the same vent field, but it is not known for certain that the plume discovered in 2009, and its respective [...] "Piccard" [...] vent site, is the same vent site that is now referred to as Beebe and Piccard. This article follows the naming convention set out by Interridge.|$|R

50|$|When {{a target}} {{is to be}} engaged, the ship's {{computer}} slews {{one of the two}} Sea Wolf trackers onto the target (there was a single tracker on a Sea Wolf Leander). Originally the Type 910, with an I-band radar, was used but this suffered from poor performance locking onto low-altitude targets hidden in the background sea clutter in the Falklands War. Low-level targets had to be engaged using the 910's secondary TV mode to manually track the target. Subsequently, the lighter Type 911 supplanted the Type 910, adding a second radar (a K-band set based on the Blindfire tracker of the Rapier missile, to control engagements at low level) and was fitted in the 7th Type 22 Frigate onwards. Unlike Type 910, Type 911 does not have any TV function; the TV camera is retained only to allow the Missile Director to <b>visually</b> <b>confirm</b> targets, and to provide a record of engagements.|$|E

40|$|As an {{essential}} part of integrated land use-transport models, prediction of land cover changes and illumination of the many factors behind such change are always of interest to planners, policy makers, developers and others. Using a mixed logit framework, this paper studies land cover evolution in the Austin, Texas region, recognizing distance-dependent correlations [...] both observed and unobserved [...] over space and time, in a sea of satellite image pixels. The paper describes the computational methods used for model estimation and application, including generalized Cholesky decomposition and likelihood simulation. Results indicate that neighborhood characteristics have strong effects on land cover evolution: Clustering is significant over time, but high residential densities can impede future development. Model application produces graphic predictions, allowing one to <b>visually</b> <b>confirm</b> these results and appreciate the variability in potential urban futures...|$|E
30|$|Using the visualization, we {{were able}} to <b>visually</b> <b>confirm</b> our initial hypothesis, namely off-trail ants tend to exhibit a {{directed}} motion, exiting the experimental arena in a direction that would have eventually led them back to the colony’s foraging trail. For example, ants captured east of the trail tend to exit the arena from the west side, which was visually confirmed using the coordinated paintbrush tool. On the other hand, ants captured on the trail exhibited tortuous non-directed motion, presumably in an attempt to pick up pheromone cues and locate the trail again. We were also able to discover additional temporal patterns, thanks to the stereoscopic 3 D view. For instance, ants that drop their seed during the capture process tend to spend a significant amount of time {{in the center of the}} experimental arena when released presumably searching for their seed. This was evident in the 3 D stereoscopic view with trajectories that were semi-perpendicular to the display surface, indicating little insect movement over few minutes.|$|E
