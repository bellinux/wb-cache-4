Besides tractors, these include ploughs, harrows, drills, transplanters, cultivators, irrigation equipment, and harvesters.

5|$|Cooking {{onions and}} sweet onions are better stored at room temperature, optimally {{in a single}} layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of {{three to four weeks}} and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. Also, they draw {{moisture}} from <b>vegetables</b> <b>with</b> which they are stored which may cause them to decay.|$|E
5|$|The {{second child}} of Johnstone Melmore and Jessie Francis Leech, Leech {{was born in}} Bendigo in Australia. She was given the name Faith after her elder sister, who died from leukaemia {{at the age of}} two. A {{delicate}} child, Leech had an aversion to eating {{in the first two years}} of her life, so her mother fed her in small hourly doses. Leech was twice rushed from the family home to a Melbourne hospital. Conventional medicine failed to rectify Leech's dietary issues, so her mother put her on a fast for ten days at the recommendation of a naturopath. Leech was later placed on a diet of fruit, salad and <b>vegetables,</b> <b>with</b> an emphasis on beetroot juice and carrot juice.|$|E

5|$|The outer rainbands of {{the storm}} first began {{affecting}} Guatemala and southeastern Mexico late on June 1. In Mexico, the peak 24-hour rainfall total was 4.96inches (126mm) in Huixtla, and across southeastern Mexico, the rainfall led to above normal levels in many rivers. An automatic surface station in Puerto Madero, Mexico recorded sustained winds of 36mph (58km/h) with gusts of 53mph (85km/h) shortly after landfall. In most locations, damage from the storm was minor, limited to downed light posts, some damaged roofs, and a brief power outage. However, winds and rains from the storm caused moderate to severe crop damage in the mountain range of southern Chiapas. About 35sq.miles (90km²) of banana crops were destroyed, with about 4sq.miles (10km²) of coffee damaged. The passage {{of the storm}} also resulted in damage to cocoa beans, mango, coconut, and other <b>vegetables,</b> <b>with</b> crop damage totaling about 200million pesos (2007MXN, $55million 2007USD). As {{a result of the}} crop damage, the government of Mexico provided 108million pesos (2007MXN, $10million 2007USD) in financial aid to the affected farmers.|$|E

25|$|The cuisine of Mizoram {{differs from}} that of most of India, though it shares {{characteristics}} to other regions of Northeast India and North India. Rice is the staple food of Mizoram, while Mizos love to add non-vegetarian ingredients in every dish. Fish, chicken, pork and beef are popular meats among Mizos. Dishes are served on fresh banana leaves. Most of the dishes are cooked in mustard oil. Meals tend to be less spicy than in most of India. Mizos love eating boiled vegetables along with rice. A popular dish is bai, made from boiling vegetables (spinach, eggplant, beans, and other leafy <b>vegetables)</b> <b>with</b> bekang fermented soya beans or Sa-um, a fermented pork and served with rice. Sawhchiar is another common dish, made of rice and cooked with pork or chicken.|$|E
25|$|Slătineanu {{was still}} part of the {{university}} senate in 1928-1929 and in 1933. He also became head of the Iași hygiene institute in 1930, {{and set up a}} tuberculosis sanatorium in nearby Erbiceni. He served as general secretary under Health Minister Cantacuzino, between 1931 and 1933. He wrote articles arguing that the high mortality rate in Romania's rural areas was {{not simply a matter of}} health, but had to do with lack of education, poverty, malnutrition, with political and administrative causes. Still a socialist, Slătineanu believed the 1923 land reform entrenched a form of neo-serfdom that did not address other issues plaguing the peasantry. He organized a model health system in Tomești plasă where he introduced various methods of health education. One of these consisted of a garden where the local peasants would learn how to cultivate <b>vegetables</b> <b>with</b> a rational system of nutrition in mind.|$|E
25|$|Currie and Ovens {{explored}} the Michelago region in 1823 {{and the first}} settlement proceeded soon thereafter, involving the ex-convict couple, Emmanuel and Catherine Elliot. The explorer Dr John Lhotsky claimed that his journey in 1834 south from the Limestone Plains toward Michelago represented a descent into what he considered barbarism: no church south of Sutton Forest, no window pane south of Canberra, no white woman south of Michelago. The first Monaro Superintendent of Police, the Corsican Francis Nicholas Rossi, built an ironbark slab homestead in the region called Micilago on 35,000 acres (14,175 hectares) in 1837; this station was bought in 1859 by Alexander Ryrie who married Charlotte Faunce the daughter of Alured Tasker Faunce the police magistrate at Queanbeyan; one of their children being Granville Ryrie, later a General in World War I, knighted and involved with the League of Nations in Geneva. Alexander Ryrie who'd renamed his property Michalago,built St Thomas' church {{in the village of}} Michelago and life for those in the area was very self-sufficient, with income from wool, cattle for meat, milk and butter, locally grown fruit and <b>vegetables,</b> <b>with</b> soap and tallow candles also being made by hand.|$|E

500|$|The primary food of Uttarakhand is <b>vegetables</b> <b>with</b> wheat being a staple, {{although}} non-vegetarian food is also served. A distinctive {{characteristic of}} Uttarakhand cuisine is the sparing use of tomatoes, milk, and milk based products. Coarse grain with high fibre content {{is very common}} in Uttarakhand due to the harsh terrain. Another crop which is associated with Uttarakhand is Buckwheat (locally called Madua or Jhingora), particularly in the interior regions of Kumaon and Garhwal. Generally, either Desi Ghee or Mustard oil {{is used for the}} purpose of cooking food. Simple recipes are made interesting with the use of hash seeds [...] "Jakhiya" [...] as spice.

Baked beans and pease porridge were everyday fare, particularly during the winter, and usually eaten with coarse, dark bread. At first, it was made with a mixture of wheat and maize (corn), but a disease struck in the 1660s called wheat rust, after which it was made of rye and maize, creating what was later known as [...] "rye 'n injun". <b>Vegetables</b> <b>with</b> meat boiled thoroughly was a popular dish, and they were cooked together rather than separately, unlike many other regions in North American colonies, and frequently without seasoning. Baking was a particular favorite of the New Englanders, and New England was the origin of dishes today seen as quintessentially American, such as apple pie and the baked Thanksgiving turkey.|$|E

2500|$|There can be {{significant}} health hazards related to using untreated [...] wastewater in agriculture. Wastewater from cities can contain {{a mixture of}} chemical and biological pollutants. In low-income countries, there are often high levels of pathogens from excreta. In emerging nations, where industrial development is outpacing environmental regulation, there are increasing risks from inorganic and organic chemicals. The World Health Organization, {{in collaboration with the}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), has developed guidelines for safe use of wastewater in 2006. These guidelines advocate a ‘multiple-barrier’ approach to wastewater use, for example by encouraging farmers to adopt various risk-reducing behaviours. These include ceasing irrigation a few days before harvesting to allow pathogens to die off in the sunlight, applying water carefully so it does not contaminate leaves likely to be eaten raw, cleaning <b>vegetables</b> <b>with</b> disinfectant or allowing fecal sludge used in farming to dry before being used as a human manure.|$|E
