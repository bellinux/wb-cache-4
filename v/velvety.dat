5|$|Apple scab: Apple scab causes {{leaves to}} develop olive-brown spots with a <b>velvety</b> texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture. The disease also affects the fruit, which also {{develops}} similar brown spots with <b>velvety</b> or cork-like textures. Apple scab is spread through fungus growing in old apple {{leaves on the}} ground and spreads during warm spring weather to infect the new year's growth.|$|E
5|$|The rare Pacific Northwest morel Morchella hotsonii, {{known only}} from its type collection, is quite similar in {{appearance}} to M.importuna. The former species is distinguished by its finely <b>velvety</b> surface.|$|E
5|$|The red-cracked bolete (Xerocomellus chrysenteron) has an olive-brown {{cap that}} cracks, exposing flesh that ages to pinkish red. Boletellus chrysenteroides, {{found only in}} eastern North America, has a <b>velvety</b> to smooth, dark reddish brown, cracked cap with pale exposed flesh.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics {{typically}} {{used in the}} field to distinguish Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca from lookalike species include: the soft, dry consistency of its cap; the crowded, decurrent, and forked gills that are saffron to orange coloured; and the lack of any distinctive taste or odour. The false chanterelle can be distinguished from the true chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) by its deeper orange colour, brown base to the stipe, <b>velvety</b> cap surface, forked gills rather than gill-like ridges, softer (and thinner) flesh, and lack of the characteristic apricot-smell. The cap surface of Hygrophoropsis fuscosquamula, found in Britain, has fine brown scales overlaying a dull orange background. H.rufa has <b>velvety</b> brown fur covering its cap, while H.macrospora has cream gills and stipe. Microscopically, these three species have larger spores than H.aurantiaca. H.tapinia, found in a range extending from southern Florida to Central America, is set apart from H.aurantiaca by its growth on or under deciduous trees (never conifers), and smaller spores, which measure 3.3–4.8 by 2.5–3.3µm.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius lignyotellus and L.lignyotus {{are similar}} to L.fallax, {{and they are all}} {{associated}} with Picea and Abies; examination of microscopic features cannot be used to distinguish between them. L.lignyotus is restricted in distribution to eastern North America and Europe. Lactarius pseudomucidus is another milk cap with a dark brown cap, but it has a smooth (not <b>velvety)</b> and slimy cap and stem. Another brown-capped eastern North American species is L.gerardii; it has distantly spaced white gills that run down the stem. L.fuliginellus, which prefers to grow near hardwoods, has close gills.|$|E
5|$|On the bird's {{forehead}} was a {{naked and}} pale chalky-blue frontal shield. This {{was surrounded by}} short, <b>velvety</b> black feathers that extended {{from the base of}} the bill to the area just below and in front of the eye, while the area below the eye was a pinkish wash. The bird's chin and throat were sparsely covered with black, <b>velvety</b> feathers, while the neck was a slaty-blue that transitioned into a brownish-grey breast. The abdomen and undertail-coverts were a rich orange, while the undertail was a blackish-grey. The wing was slaty with a hint of brown at its base and became a warm, dark brown by the wingtips; the underwing was brown. The back was grey and transitioned into a browner rump, while the uppertail-coverts were a dark sooty-grey with blackish tips. The tail, which was short and rounded, was a very dark indigo that had a slightly purple iridescent sheen. The bill was bicoloured; the upper mandible was chalky-blue with a black tip while the lower mandible was red. The plumage of the juvenile is unknown. The bird's feet were a dull purplish-red and unfeathered up to the heel, while the iris was a dark brown.|$|E
5|$|The bat {{species that}} occur in the {{archipelago}} of Puerto Rico are: greater bulldog bat (Noctilio leporinus), Antillean ghost-faced bat (Mormoops blainvillii), Parnell's mustached bat (Pteronotus parnellii), sooty mustached bat (Pteronotus quadridens), Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis), Antillean fruit bat (Brachyphylla cavernarum), buffy flower bat (Erophylla sezekorni bombifrons), Leach's single leaf bat (Monophyllus redmani), red fruit bat (Stenoderma rufum), big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis), <b>velvety</b> free-tailed bat (Molossus molossus), and Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis).|$|E
5|$|Although in {{some areas}} the marsh shrew is {{sympatric}} {{with other members of}} the genus Sorex, no other large, <b>velvety,</b> gray-black shrew shares this geographic range. Its size distinguishes it from all but the American water shrew (Sorex palustris). Although the marsh shrew and the American water shrew (the two largest shrews in North America) share some features, the American water shrew has more dark-grey-to-black fur on its back, a silver-grey belly and a bi-colored tail and the marsh shrew's fringed hairs are more distinct. The American water shrew has a smaller skull, without the marsh shrew's characteristic curvature, and its upper incisors have less-distinct medial tines. The marsh shrew typically has a longer snout than that of the American water shrew, which is more streamlined when viewed from the side.|$|E
5|$|Géricault {{painted with}} small brushes and viscous oils, which allowed {{little time for}} {{reworking}} and were dry by the next morning. He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of vermilion, white, naples yellow, two different yellow ochres, two red ochres, raw sienna, light red, burnt sienna, crimson lake, Prussian blue, peach black, ivory black, cassel earth and bitumen. Bitumen has a <b>velvety,</b> lustrous appearance when first painted, but {{over a period of}} time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated. As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis {{species have}} fruit bodies with concave caps that often have wavy margins and rolled-in edges. The {{texture of the}} cap surface ranges from {{somewhat}} tomentose to <b>velvety.</b> Typical fruit body colors are orange, brownish-yellow (fulvous) or paler, buff, and cream. The gills have a decurrent attachment to the stipe. They are narrow with blunt edges, often multiply forked, and readily detachable from the stipe. The flesh is soft and generally the same colour as the fruit body surface, or lighter. The taste and odour of the flesh is usually nondescript, or similar to cultivated mushrooms. In contrast, H.rufa can have a distinct ozone-like smell, reportedly reminiscent of the orchid Oncidium ornithorhynchum or a photocopier.|$|E
5|$|In malignant-type {{smallpox}} (also called flat smallpox) the lesions remained almost {{flush with}} the skin {{at the time when}} raised vesicles form in the ordinary type. It is unknown why some people developed this type. Historically, it accounted for 5–10 percent of cases, and the majority (72 percent) were children. Malignant smallpox was accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasted 3–4 days, prolonged high fever, and severe symptoms of toxemia. The rash on the tongue and palate was extensive. Skin lesions matured slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they were flat and appeared to be buried in the skin. Unlike ordinary-type smallpox, the vesicles contained little fluid, were soft and <b>velvety</b> to the touch, and may have contained hemorrhages. Malignant smallpox was nearly always fatal.|$|E
5|$|Its {{distribution}} {{has been}} greatly reduced and is now discontinuous. Decades of poaching for its <b>velvety</b> pelt, peaking in the 1950s and 1960s, considerably diminished population numbers. The species was listed as endangered in 1999 and wild population estimates are typically below 5,000. The Guianas {{are one of the}} last real strongholds for the species, which also enjoys modest numbers — and significant protection — in the Peruvian Amazonian basin. It {{is one of the most}} endangered mammal species in the neotropics. Habitat degradation and loss is the greatest current threat. The giant otter is also rare in captivity; in 2003, only 60 animals were being held.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius torminosus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, {{and as such}} {{plays an}} important role in facilitating nutrient and water uptake by trees. It grows in association with birch (Betula) and hemlock (Tsuga) in mixed forests. It is also known to grow in urban settings when birch trees are nearby. A field study in Scotland concluded that the species is more likely to be present in older than in younger birch woodlands. Fruit bodies grow on the ground, scattered or grouped together. They are a component of the diet of the red squirrel, and serve as breeding sites for some fungus-feeding flies in the Drosophilidae and Mycetophilidae families. Lactarius torminosus mushrooms may be parasitized by the mold Hypomyces lithuanicus, which produces a cream-ochre to cinnamon-colored granular or <b>velvety</b> growth of mycelium on the surfaces of the gills and causes them to be deformed.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are long}} and narrow. The first dorsal fin is large and high, with a rounded apex, and originating just behind the pectoral fin bases. The pelvic fins are {{much smaller than the}} first dorsal fin. The second dorsal and anal fins are smaller still, and placed about even with each other on narrow bases that allow pivoting from side to side. The sides of the caudal peduncle are expanded into prominent lateral keels. A second, shorter pair of keels are present below the main keels. The caudal fin is large and crescent-shaped, with the lower lobe almost as long as the upper; there are both dorsal and ventral depressions (precaudal pits) at the caudal fin base, and a deep ventral notch near the tip of the upper caudal fin lobe. The skin is soft and covered by tiny, flattened dermal denticles (scales), lending a <b>velvety</b> texture. Each denticle has three horizontal ridges that lead to teeth on the posterior margin.|$|E
25|$|The upperside of male is <b>velvety</b> black.|$|E
25|$|Forewing with well-marked pale adnervular streaks on the discal {{area that}} do not reach the {{terminal}} margin, the latter broadly <b>velvety</b> black; the streaks beyond end of cell extended inwards into its apex.|$|E
25|$|Blaufränkisch wines have {{aromas of}} dark ripe {{cherries}} and dark berries, are spicy, have medium tannin levels and sometimes very good acidity. Young wines are deeply fruity {{and become more}} <b>velvety,</b> supple and complex with age.|$|E
25|$|<b>Velvety</b> maroon {{red with}} shiny black head and four rows of fleshy bright red tubercles. Grey {{markings}} {{on the back}} with a broad oblique pink white band on the 7th and 8th segments. These are heavily parasitised by tiny braconid wasps.|$|E
25|$|Five {{species of}} bats are {{known in the}} {{literature}} from Anguilla – the threatened insular single leaf bat (Monophyllus plethodon), the Antillean fruit-eating bat (Brachyphylla cavernarum), the Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis), the Mexican funnel-eared bat (Natalus stramineus), and the <b>velvety</b> free-tailed bat (Molossus molossus).|$|E
25|$|Guinness Red Harvest Stout was {{introduced}} in September 2013. sold in 14.9oz widget cans: 4.1% alcohol by volume (ABV); Inspired by the ancient Celtic festival of samhain, the seasonal Guinness Red Harvest Stout has a mildly sweet <b>velvety</b> taste and deep red hue. Crafted with a blend of lightly roasted barley and sweet Irish malt.|$|E
25|$|Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) {{is a set}} {{of symptoms}} due to elevated androgens (male hormones) in women. Signs and symptoms of PCOS include irregular or no menstrual periods, heavy periods, excess body and facial hair, acne, pelvic pain, difficulty getting pregnant, and patches of thick, darker, <b>velvety</b> skin. Associated conditions include type 2 diabetes, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, heart disease, mood disorders, and endometrial cancer.|$|E
25|$|Male upperside: {{somewhat}} {{more than half}} the forewing from base <b>velvety</b> black, apical half dull fuliginous; cell-area with or without two short transverse orange bars; a blue patch above, the tornus; the outer margin of the basal black area obliquely zigzag in a line from the middle of costa to apex of vein 2, including a large discal, generally obscure ocellus, which, however, in some specimens is prominently ringed with orange yellow. Beyond this a broad white irregularly oblique discal band followed by a short oblique preapical bar from costa; a small black orange-ringed ocellus beneath the bar, a subterminal continuous line of white spots in the interspaces and a terminal jet-black slender line; cilia alternately dusky black and white. Hindwing blue shaded with <b>velvety</b> black towards base; a postdiscal black white-centred orange and black-ringed ocellus in interspace 2, a round minutely white-centred velvety-black spot (sometimes entirely absent) in interspace 5; the termen narrowly white, traversed by an inner and an outer subterminal and a terminal black line; cilia white.|$|E
25|$|Wines {{from the}} Central Valley of La Morra and Barolo {{tend to be}} very perfumed and <b>velvety</b> with less tannins than other Barolos. The soil of the Central Valley itself is more clay based with {{increased}} levels of magnesium oxide and manganese. The wines from the Serralunga Valley are more full bodied and tannic and require aging of 12–15 years before they hit their peak. The soil of the Serralunga is heavy in sand, iron, limestone, phosphorus and potassium.|$|E
25|$|Korma is {{actually}} the Indian name for the technique of braising meat. It originated in the lavish Moghul cuisine wherein lamb or chicken was braised in <b>velvety,</b> spiced sauces, enriched with ground nuts, cream and butter. While kormas are rich, they are also mild, containing little or no cayenne or chillies. There are both vegetarian (navratan korma) and non-vegetarian (chicken, lamb, beef and fish korma) varieties of korma. Murgh Awadhi Korma is a classic from Lucknow.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{leaves are}} {{five to ten}} centimeters (2-4 inches) long and are roundly and deeply lobed. The leaf width is {{approximately}} one half its length. Each leaf is matte green with an underneath pale green appearance; moreover, the leaf is covered with abundant soft fuzz, yielding an almost <b>velvety</b> feeling. When a fresh leaf is rubbed or broken, an aromatic scent is exuded, evoking a forest odor. The wood is a dull brown approaching yellow, {{and it has not}} been used extensively for milling.|$|E
25|$|Both {{male and}} female boreal caribou have antlers during part of the year, {{although}} some females may have only one antler or no antlers at all (Boreal Caribou ATK Reports, 2010-2011). On the males these grow so quickly each year that <b>velvety</b> lumps in March can become a rack measuring more than a metre in length by August. Antlers of boreal caribou are flattened, compact, and relatively dense. Boreal caribou antlers are thicker and broader {{than those of the}} barren-ground caribou, and their legs and heads are longer.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{is added}} {{in various forms}} to an espresso: steamed milk makes a caffè latte, equal parts steamed milk and milk froth make a cappuccino, and a dollop of hot foamed milk on top creates a caffè macchiato. A flat white is {{prepared}} by adding steamed hot milk (microfoam) to espresso so that the flavour is brought out and the texture is unusually <b>velvety.</b> It has less milk than a latte but both are varieties of coffee to which the milk can be added {{in such a way}} as to create a decorative surface pattern. Such effects are known as latte art.|$|E
25|$|By the way, {{would you}} convey my {{compliments}} to the purist who reads your proofs {{and tell him}} or her that I write {{in a sort of}} broken-down patois which is something like the way a Swiss-waiter talks, and that when I split an infinitive, God damn it, I split it so it will remain split, and when I interrupt the <b>velvety</b> smoothness of my more or less literate syntax with a few sudden words of barroom vernacular, this is done with the eyes wide open and the mind relaxed and attentive. The method may not be perfect, but it is all I have.|$|E
25|$|This {{species has}} a single brood. Adult Apollo {{butterflies}} are seen on the wing from May to September, feeding on nectar produced by flowers. During mating males deposit on the female's abdomen a gelatinous secretion called sphragis, that prevents the female mating a second time. The females lay eggs, which over-winter and hatch in spring the following year. The Apollo caterpillar a <b>velvety</b> blue black with small orange spots. These caterpillars feed on stonecrop (Sedum species, mainly Sedum telephium, Sedum album, Sedum rupestre and Sedum ropsea), Hylotelephium caucasicum and houseleek (Sempervivum species). When the caterpillar is fully grown it will pupate on the ground, forming a loose cocoon from which the adult butterfly emerges following metamorphosis.|$|E
25|$|Laughton's voice, equally {{capable of}} a penetrating, theater-filling shout and a soft, <b>velvety</b> tone, first {{appeared}} on 78-rpm records {{with the release of}} five British Regal Zonophone 10-inch discs entitled Voice of the Stars issued annually from 1934 to 1938. These featured short soundtrack snippets from the year's top films. He is heard on all five records in, respectively, The Private Life of Henry VIII, The Barretts of Wimpole Street, Mutiny on the Bounty, I, Claudius (curiously, since this film was unfinished and thus never released), and Vessel of Wrath. In 1937 he recorded Lincoln's Gettysburg Address on a 10-inch Columbia 78, having made a strong impression with it in Ruggles of Red Gap.|$|E
25|$|The grape {{clusters}} of Argentine Malbec {{are different from}} its French relatives, having smaller berries in tighter, smaller clusters. This suggests that the cuttings brought over by Pouget and later French immigrants were a unique clone that may have gone extinct in France due to frost and the phylloxera epidemic. Argentine Malbec wine is characterized by its deep color and intense fruity flavors with a <b>velvety</b> texture. While it doesn't have the tannic structure of a French Malbec, being more plush in texture, Argentine Malbecs have shown aging potential similar to their French counterparts. The Mendoza region is the leading producer of Malbec in Argentina with plantings found throughout the country {{in places such as}} La Rioja, Salta, San Juan, Catamarca and Buenos Aires.|$|E
25|$|The white wines of the Coteaux du Layon, Montlouis-sur-Loire, Savennières, and Vouvray {{are based}} on Chenin blanc and {{are known for their}} high acidity when young and ability to develop and age well. The villages of Sancerre and Pouilly-sur-Loire are known for their crisp and {{herbaceous}} Sauvignon blancs. Some producers in the area are experimenting with oak aging their Sauvignon blanc to give them more rounder and softer appeal. The villages of Bourgueil, Chinon and Saumur are known for their Cabernet franc based wines that range from light and fruity in Saumur to rich and <b>velvety</b> in Chinon. The Muscadet wines from the Pays de la Loire are made from the Melon de Bourgogne grape and are known for their citrus and mineral notes.|$|E
25|$|The {{style in}} which Bouguereau chooses {{to paint the}} {{children}} is articulated and meaningful. Their white flesh is luminous and rosy- a symbol to their purity. Wings sprout delicately from their shoulders. Bouguereau invokes whimsical elements of childhood and young love {{through the use of}} pastels and soft, <b>velvety</b> brushstrokes. The painting is mostly blue, an uncommon color for the portrayal of a love story. By not using pink and reds, the painter steers away from the theme of forbidden love and towards the idea of young love. The colors are cool and crisp. Bouguereau takes care to accurately portray the pudginess of Cupid and Psyche. The painting is full of texture from the light fabrics, wispy golden hair, and smoothness of their skin. The painting doesn’t strike the viewer but is a rest for the eyes.|$|E
25|$|Exophiala dermatitidis forms slow growing, {{brown or}} black colonies. As is common amongst black yeasts, E. dermatitidis is an {{anamorphic}} fungus with multiple conidial forms. This morphological plasticity has complicated taxonomic determination {{based solely on}} physical appearance. Young colonies are described as waxy, mucoid, smooth, and yeastlike. Over time pigmented aerial hyphae develop, and older colonies are described as appearing filamentous and <b>velvety.</b> Conidia are between globular and elliptical in shape, and form {{at the mouth of}} short annellidic conidiogenous cells. Annellations can only be observed by electron microscopy. Prior to analysis by scanning electron microscope, the condiogenous cells were observed to form from non-annelated phialides and phialides without collarettes. These observations caused the species to be erroneously provided with its own monotypic genus, Wangiella. The species name Wangiella dermatitidis is still commonly used in the scientific literature.|$|E
25|$|As a varietal wine, Merlot {{can make}} soft, <b>velvety</b> wines with plum flavors. While Merlot wines tend to mature faster than Cabernet Sauvignon, some {{examples}} {{can continue to}} develop in the bottle for decades. There are three main styles of Merlot — a soft, fruity, smooth wine with very little tannins, a fruity wine with more tannic structure and, finally, a brawny, highly tannic style made in the profile of Cabernet Sauvignon. Some of the fruit notes commonly associated with Merlot include cassis, black and red cherries, blackberry, blueberry, boysenberry, mulberry, ollalieberry and plum. Vegetable and earthy notes include black and green olives, cola nut, bell pepper, fennel, humus, leather, mushrooms, rhubarb and tobacco. Floral and herbal notes commonly associated with Merlot include green and black tea, eucalyptus, laurel, mint, oregano, pine, rosemary, sage, sarsaparilla and thyme. When Merlot has spent significant time in oak, the wine may show notes of caramel, chocolate, coconut, coffee bean, dill weed, mocha, molasses, smoke, vanilla and walnut.|$|E
25|$|The Barolo zone can be broadly {{divided into}} two valleys. The Serralunga Valley to the east {{includes}} the communes of Castiglione Falletto, Monforte d'Alba and Serralunga d'Alba. Planted with soils higher in sand, limestone, iron, phosphorus and potassium, the wines of Serralunga Valley tend to be austere and powerful and require significant aging (at least 12–15 years) to develop. The Central Valley to the west includes the communes of Barolo and La Morra with soils higher in clay, manganese and magnesium oxide. This region tends to produce wines with more perfumed aromas and <b>velvety</b> textures. These wines {{tend to be less}} tannic and full bodied than those from the Serralunga Valley and can require less aging (8 to 10 years). The most widely planted and productive region of the Barolo zone is La Morra which is responsible for nearly a third of all wine labeled as Barolo and produces twice as much wine as the next leading zone of Serralunga d'Alba.|$|E
