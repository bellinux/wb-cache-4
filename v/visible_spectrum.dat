30|$|The {{effect of}} pH on {{the removal of}} MB was {{investigated}} over the pH range from 2.5 to 10. The pH was adjusted with 0.1 N NaOH and 0.1 N HCl solutions. In this study, 200  ml of MB dye solution with a concentration of 50  mg/L was taken in a plastic Erlenmeyer flask and was agitated with 0.25  g of MLP. There was no appreciable change in pH of the solution during adsorption. It was presumed that the change in solution pH would cause {{a change in the}} structure of MB, and consequently, in its adsorption process. The change in the structure of MB would be detected by the variations in the <b>visible</b> <b>spectra</b> of MB. To verify such possibilities, the effect of pH on the <b>visible</b> <b>spectra</b> of MB solution was tested in the absence of adsorbents. As the variation in the spectra at given pH might be time-dependent, the <b>visible</b> <b>spectra</b> of MB solution was recorded at the same interval time after the pH was adjusted. It was found that the absorbance of the spectra was stable in the investigated pH range (pH 2.5 – 10).|$|R
5|$|Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, {{but a small}} {{minority}} experiment with wavelengths outside the <b>visible</b> <b>spectrum.</b> This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was Karl Jansky, who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (e.g. the One-Mile Telescope).|$|E
5|$|The luster of {{a diamond}} is {{described}} as 'adamantine', which simply means diamond-like. Reflections on a properly cut diamond's facets are undistorted, due to their flatness. The refractive index of diamond (as measured via sodium light, 589.3nm) is 2.417. Because it is cubic in structure, diamond is also isotropic. Its high dispersion of 0.044 (variation of refractive index across the <b>visible</b> <b>spectrum)</b> manifests in the perceptible fire of cut diamonds. This fire—flashes of prismatic colors seen in transparent stones—is perhaps diamond's most important optical property from a jewelry perspective. The prominence or amount of fire seen in a stone is heavily influenced by the choice of diamond cut and its associated proportions (particularly crown height), although the body color of fancy (i.e., unusual) diamonds may hide their fire to some degree.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, {{a team of}} Indian, British and American astronomers {{working in}} Java (Indonesia) and Kavalur (India) claimed that they had {{detected}} a thin atmosphere during an occultation, when it and Jupiter passed {{in front of a}} star. They estimated that the surface pressure was around 0.1 Pa. However, in 1979, Voyager 1 observed an occultation of the star κ Centauri during its flyby of Jupiter, with differing results. The occultation measurements were conducted in the far-ultraviolet spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 200 nm, which were much more sensitive to the presence of gases than the 1972 measurements made in the <b>visible</b> <b>spectrum.</b> No atmosphere was revealed by the Voyager data. The upper limit on the surface particle number density was found to be , which corresponds to a surface pressure of less than 2.5 µPa. The latter value is almost five orders of magnitude less than the 1972 estimate.|$|E
40|$|In April 2001 we {{obtained}} <b>visible</b> and near-infrared <b>spectra,</b> {{as well as}} photometric data, for two Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), 2000 GN 171 (now numbered 47932) and 2000 EB 173 (now designated 38628 Huya), which belong to the dynamical class of Plutinos. These observations were made with the FORS 1 and ISAAC instruments at the European Southern Observatory-Very Large Telescope (ESO-VLT). The detection of weak absorption features in the <b>visible</b> <b>spectra</b> of these two Trans-Neptunians has been reported elsewhere (Lazzarin et al. Lazzarin 03). In this paper, we discuss {{the interpretation of the}} features, which are different for the two objects, and we present some complementary observations in the near-infrared, as well as more recent (May 2002) <b>visible</b> <b>spectra</b> in which the features are absent. Although the visible colors of the two objects are comparable, the near-infrared spectra are different: (47932) 2000 GN 171 shows a nearly flat spectrum, except in the H band where a broad absorption appears, whereas the spectrum of (38628) Huya (2000 EB 173) has a red slope in the J band and some absorption beyond 2 micron. The features detected in the <b>visible</b> <b>spectra</b> of the two objects are tentatively attributed to the presence of iron oxides or phyllosilicates at the surfaces of the two objects. The differences between the April 2001 and May 2002 <b>visible</b> <b>spectra</b> are attributed to spatial variations at the surfaces of the objects. We briefly discuss possibilities for aqueous alteration in TNOs, after reviewing {{what we know about the}} presence of aqueously altered minerals in other small bodies of the solar system. Further studies monitoring the rotation of these two objects are highly desirable. Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, programme 167. C- 0340...|$|R

5|$|Spectral {{analysis}} of Makemake's surface revealed that methane must {{be present in}} the form of large grains at least one centimetre in size. In addition to methane, large amounts of ethane and tholins as well as smaller amounts of ethylene, acetylene and high-mass alkanes (like propane) may be present, most likely created by photolysis of methane by solar radiation. The tholins are probably responsible for the red color of the <b>visible</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Although evidence exists for the presence of nitrogen ice on its surface, at least mixed with other ices, there is nowhere near the same level of nitrogen as on Pluto and Triton, where it composes more than 98percent of the crust. The relative lack of nitrogen ice suggests that its supply of nitrogen has somehow been depleted over the age of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a Hubble {{successor}} materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which {{culminated in}} {{plans for the}} James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble. Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, {{it is designed to}} operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft. A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars in the early Universe approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects. The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency since 1996, and is planned for launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the <b>visible</b> <b>spectrum.</b> A typical human eye can see to about 750nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light.|$|E
