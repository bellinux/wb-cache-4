5|$|Before Gorbachev's <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., for {{the third}} summit in 1987, the Soviet leader {{announced}} his intention to pursue significant arms agreements. The timing of the announcement led Western diplomats to contend that Gorbachev was offering major concessions to the United States on the levels of conventional forces, nuclear weapons, and policy in Eastern Europe. He and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) at the White House, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons. The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START I; Reagan insisted that {{the name of the}} treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.|$|E

25|$|At {{the outset}} India's {{relations}} with Bangladesh {{could not have}} been stronger because of India's unalloyed support for independence and opposition against Pakistan in 1971. During the independence war, many refugees fled to India. When the struggle of resistance matured in November 1971, India also intervened militarily and may have helped bring international attention to the issue through Indira Gandhi's <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. Afterwards India furnished relief and reconstruction aid. India extended recognition to Bangladesh prior {{to the end of the}} war in 1971 (the second country to do so after Bhutan) and subsequently lobbied others to follow suit. India also withdrew its military from the land of Bangladesh when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman requested Indira Gandhi to do so during the latter's visit to Dhaka in 1972.|$|E

In March {{she made a}} <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> D.C., where she met with middle-ranking government officials but was kept at bay by the governing administration of President Ronald Reagan. Bhutto made several additional visits to the United States over the coming few years. While in exile, Benazir became a rallying point for the PPP. Murtaza {{believed that it was}} he, and not Benazir, who was their father's designated political heir; as evidence, he cited that he had been asked to manage his father's Larkana constituency in the 1977 general election. Bhutto biographer Shyam Bhatia thought that this was probably Zulfikar's intention, as the latter would have recognised the significant impediments to a woman being elected leader in a conservative Islamic society like Pakistan. Benazir nevertheless maintained that her father had always wanted her to become a politician.|$|E
25|$|She {{served as}} the United States Ambassador to Czechoslovakia (August 23, 1989 – July 12, 1992), having been {{appointed}} by President George H. W. Bush. She {{was the first and}} only female US ambassador to the former Czechoslovakia. Temple was a witness to two crucial moments in the history of Czechoslovakia's fight against communism. She was in Prague in August 1968, {{as a representative of the}} International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies and going to meet with Czechoslovakian party leader Alexander Dubček on the very day that Soviet-backed forces invaded the country. Dubček fell out of favor with the Soviets after a series of reforms known as the Prague Spring. Temple, who was stranded at a hotel as the tanks rolled in, sought refuge on the roof of the hotel. She later reported that it was from here she saw an unarmed woman on the street gunned down by Soviet forces, a sight that stayed with her for the rest of her life. Later, after she became ambassador to Czechoslovakia, she was present in the Velvet Revolution, which brought about the end of communism in Czechoslovakia. Temple played a critical role in hastening the end of the communist regime by openly sympathizing with anti-communist dissidents and later establishing formal diplomatic relations with the newly elected government led by Václav Havel. She took the unusual step of personally accompanying Havel on his first official <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> travelling on the same plane.|$|E

Thus, my tribute is less to his personality and more to his intellect and accomplishments. As anyone who has read much of his work knows, Bill’s writing reveals not only a first-rate intellect, but also an attractive personality and character.

He was the first reigning monarch to visit America during his 1874 <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. for negotiations on the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875. The state dinner in his honor hosted by President Ulysses S. Grant was the first White House state dinner ever given.

500|$|At the State Department, Raphel {{prioritized}} {{resolution of}} the Kashmir problem to reduce tensions between India and Pakistan as one the central policy positions during her tenure. Her characterization of Kashmir as [...] "disputed territory"– a first {{in the annals of}} U.S. diplomacy– made her popular in Pakistan, where her first husband Arnold Raphel had been ambassador while also making her unpopular with the Indian establishment, which was loath to allow any interference of outside powers in what New Delhi considered a purely domestic matter. Kashmir was raised on the agenda in Bhutto's first state <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> in April 1995. It would remain a key topic of regional and bilateral discussions with both India and Pakistan throughout Clinton's two terms in office. Raphel's outspoken advocacy for Pakistan in resolution of Kashmir would lead to pressure from India for Raphel to be removed from her post. She left the State Department's South Asia section in late June 1997.|$|E
500|$|Laffoon's {{feud with}} Lieutenant Governor Chandler {{continued}} throughout his term and affected the 1935 gubernatorial race. (At the time, {{the lieutenant governor}} was elected independently from the governor.) Term-limited by the state constitution, Laffoon supported political boss Tom Rhea to succeed him as governor, and convinced the Democrats to again hold a nominating convention to choose their gubernatorial nominee. This would have greatly improved Laffoon's chances of hand-picking his successor. While Laffoon was on a <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., Chandler was left as acting governor under {{the provisions of the}} Kentucky Constitution. Chandler issued a call for a special legislative session to consider a mandatory primary election bill. Laffoon rushed back to the state to invalidate the call, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld it as constitutional, and the primary law was passed. Chandler defeated Rhea in the primary, and went on to succeed Laffoon as governor. Following his term in office, Laffoon returned to his native Madisonville, where he died of a stroke in 1941. Among his gubernatorial legacies was appointing a record number of Kentucky colonels, including Harland Sanders, who used the title [...] "Colonel" [...] when he opened his chain of Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants.|$|E

Before 1999, {{clinical}} experience {{demonstrated that the}} sylvatic (or Northern) biotype of Echinococcus granulosus seen in Alaska produced fewer complications and serious sequelae than infection with the pastoral (or European) biotype found {{in other parts of}} the world.

The adverse outcomes could have been rare complications that are part of the clinical spectrum of disease caused by sylvatic cystic echinococcus, an indication that the sylvatic biotype, especially when affecting the liver, has potential for severe clinical consequences, or perhaps in one case, infection with a more virulent biotype of E. granulosus contracted during <b>visits</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> State...|$|R
