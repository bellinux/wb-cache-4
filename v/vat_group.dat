40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to groups as value added tax payers. This concept was {{introduced}} into Czech law on 1 st January 2008. A <b>VAT</b> <b>group</b> enables persons that meet the criteria required by the VAT Act {{to be considered a}} single taxable person, i. e. a single tax payer. The Czech <b>VAT</b> <b>group</b> legislation is based on article 11 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 /EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax. The aim of this thesis is to present and thoroughly analyze <b>VAT</b> <b>group</b> legislation in Czech law, and to point out certain pitfalls of this legislation, including its interaction with EU law, and the law of some of the other EU member states. A secondary goal is to assess the rate at which VAT groups are being used in the Czech Republic. The first chapter describes <b>VAT</b> <b>group</b> in EU law, and its introduction into the Czech legal order. The second chapter discusses the requirements that the law puts on members of a <b>VAT</b> <b>group,</b> with extra emphasis on the requirement of close binding of persons, including the membership of physical persons and non-taxable persons in a <b>VAT</b> <b>group.</b> The third chapter deals with <b>VAT</b> <b>group</b> as a subject of legal relations, describing in more detail the concept of a representative member and the responsibilities of a <b>VAT</b> <b>group</b> member.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the clinical outcome of viscoelastics (VE, sodium hyaluronate) -augmented trabeculecto-my (VAT, 66 eyes) and conventional trabeculectomy (CT, 57 eyes) for glaucomatous eyes. Methods: In the <b>VAT</b> <b>group,</b> {{half of the}} anterior chamber space was filled with VE via the paracentesis site {{at the end of}} CT and a balanced salt solution was injected into the anterior chamber. This procedure induced migration of VE from the anterior chamber into the bleb space; thus the bleb was elevated with underlying VE. Follow-up examinations were performed until 1 year after surgery. Success was defined as the attainment of an intraocular pressure (IOP) greater than 5 mmHg and less than 22 mmHg. If IOP was in the range of suc-cess without antiglaucoma medication, it was regarded as a complete success. Results: The mean postoperative IOP was significantly lower in the <b>VAT</b> <b>group</b> at postoperative 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month. The complete success rate was significantly higher in the <b>VAT</b> <b>group</b> (89 %) than in the CT group (75 %), though the qualified success rate was not different between the two groups. The number of IOP-lower-ing medications at postoperative 1 year was significantly higher in the CT group (1. 30 ± 1. 08 vs. 0. 73 ± 0. 98, p = 0. 003). Among postoperative procedures, laser suture lysis was required less frequently in the <b>VAT</b> <b>group</b> (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Placing VE within the bleb at the end of surgery may result in better IOP control and less need fo...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Voice and {{swallowing}} {{symptoms are}} frequently reported after thyroidectomy even in absence of objective voice alterations. We evaluated {{the influence of}} the video-assisted approach on voice and swallowing outcome of thyroidectomy. METHODS: Sixty-five patients undergoing total thyroidectomy (TT) were recruited. Eligibility criteria were: nodule size<or= 30 mm, thyroid volume<or= 30 ml, no previous neck surgery. Exclusion criteria were: younger than aged 18 years and older than aged 75 years, vocal fold paralysis, history of voice, laryngeal or pulmonary diseases, malignancy other than papillary thyroid carcinoma. Patients were randomized for video-assisted (VAT) or conventional (CT) thyroidectomy. Videostrobolaryngoscopy (VSL), acoustic voice analysis (AVA), and maximum phonation time (MPT) evaluation were performed preoperatively and 3 months after TT. Subjective evaluation of voice (voice impairment score=VIS) and swallowing (swallowing impairment score=SIS) were obtained preoperatively, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after TT. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients completed the postoperative evaluation: 29 in the <b>VAT</b> <b>group,</b> and 24 in the CT group. No laryngeal nerves injury was shown at postoperative VSL. Mean postoperative MPT, F 0, Flow, Fhigh, and the number of semitones were significantly reduced in the CT group but not in the <b>VAT</b> <b>group.</b> Mean VIS 3 months after surgery was significantly higher than preoperatively in CT group but not in the <b>VAT</b> <b>group.</b> Mean SIS was significantly decreased 1 and 3 months after VAT but not after CT. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and the severity of early voice and swallowing postthyroidectomy symptoms are significantly reduced in patients who undergo VAT compared with conventional surgery...|$|E

40|$|In September 2014 the ECJ {{issued its}} {{decision}} in C- 7 / 13 the Skandia case. The case con- cerned service transactions made between a main establishment {{in a third}} country and its Swedish branch. The branch {{was a member of}} a <b>VAT</b> <b>group</b> in Sweden. The ECJ estab- lished that the membership resulted in that the <b>VAT</b> <b>group</b> was considered as one taxable person which meant that the services was considered provided to the group itself and not the separate member. Therefore the transactions were deemed taxable. The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the ECJ’s assessment and judgment of the Skandia case, and how the decision affect art. 11 of the VAT Directive about VAT groups. The art. 11 of the VAT Directive provides a possibility for Member States of the EU to in- troduce rules that makes it possible for more than one person, if they meet certain criteria, to qualify as a single taxable person. In Sweden, these rules are implemented in chapter 6 a of the Swedish VAT Law. The rules on VAT groups have been further developed and in- terpreted by case law from the ECJ. The thesis shows that the Skandia case confirms some of the principles from previous case law, and develops new principles for the application of art. 11 of the VAT Directive. We draw the conclusion that the development of the law in relation to the ECJ's decision in the Skandia case, indicates that art. 11 of the VAT Directive should be assessed independently and not be influenced by other articles of the VAT Directive. We also believe that the Skandia case suggest that the territorial limitation of art. 11 means that a person must be physically established in a Member State to be able to be a member of a <b>VAT</b> <b>group</b> in that Member State. Finally, we draw the conclusion that the Skandia case indicates that the ECJ has taken inspiration from the international co-operation organ OECD. Such development is interesting because a correlation between these two organs would lead to a greater pre- dictability and legal certainty on an international level. ...|$|E

Investigating the effects of training on electrophysiological brain activity might elucidate the mechanisms underlying improvements and allow better training method selection. Electroencephalography (EEG) is ideal for studying divided attention as switching attention is a dynamic process that takes place within milliseconds and requires high temporal resolution. All participants (mean age 69. 5 years, SD= 6. 42) performed a visual detection task and an alphanumeric equation task under single and dual-task conditions. Afterwards, participants {{were randomly assigned to}} three groups: The single task training group (STT, N= 13) practiced the two tasks separately; the fixed attention training group (FAT, N= 12) was trained to assign equal attention to both tasks concurrently; the variable-attention training group (VAT, N= 14) was trained to flexibly vary their attention while performing the tasks concurrently. After training, participants were tested again. EEG measures were taken pre- and post-training. Training led to behavioural improvements in all of our participants, with the <b>VAT</b> <b>group</b> displaying the greatest benefits and a reduction in dual-task costs. The N 1 component was less pronounced after training while P 2 was enhanced, suggesting more efficient processing. Functional connectivity measures indicated an increase in theta band coherence between fronto-parietal and fronto-occipital regions in the <b>VAT</b> <b>group,</b> suggesting improved cognitive control. Our results suggest that variable attentional allocation training incurred behavioural benefits with an electrophysiological profile distinct from single task practice and equal priority dual-task training...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Comparison of {{conventional}} trabeculectomy (CT) and viscoelastic-augmented trabeculectomy (VAT) in primary open-angle glaucoma. Methods: A total of 65 primary open-angle glaucoma cases were taken {{for each of}} the two groups, i. e., CT and VAT. Viscoelastic-augmented trabeculectomy constituted lamellar scleral flap, deep scleral flap, penetrating trabeculectomy, peripheral iridectomy, filling of the anterior chamber with viscoelastic (sodium hyaluronate) and balanced salt solution, movement of visco in bleb, and tight flap closure. Success criteria included intraocular pressure (IOP) < 14 mmHg with no devastating complications. P < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Mean IOP was significantly lower after VAT compared to CT at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months postoperatively.

40|$|Background: Greater central {{adiposity}} {{is related}} to the risk of diabetes. Objective: We aimed to test the hypothesis that central adiposity measured by computed tomography (CT) is a better predictor of the risk of diabetes than is body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist/hip ratio (WHR), or waist/height ratio. Design: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were measured at the L 2 – 3 and L 4 – 5 disc spaces in 1106 of the 3234 participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program. Sex-specific proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between VAT and SAT at both cuts, BMI, and other measures of central adiposity as predictors of the development of diabetes. Results: Men had more VAT than did women. White subjects had more VAT at both cuts than did other ethnic groups. The ratio of VAT to SAT was lowest in African Americans of both sexes. Among men in the placebo <b>group,</b> <b>VAT</b> at both cuts, WC, BMI, waist/height ratio, and WHR predicted diabetes (hazard ratio: 1. 79 – 1. 44 per 1 SD of variable). Among women in the lifestyle <b>group,</b> <b>VAT</b> at both cuts predicted diabetes as well as did BMI, and L 2 – 3 was a significantly better predictor than was WC or WHR. SAT did not predict diabetes. None of the body fat measurements predicted diabetes in the met-formin group. Conclusions: In the placebo and lifestyle <b>groups,</b> <b>VAT</b> at both cuts, WHR, and WC predicted diabetes. No measure predicted diabetes in the metformin group.

40|$|Abstract VAT {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} government revenues and is being widely applied by more than 120 countries and areas, with coverage from the under-developed area in Africa and Asia to the well developed Western Europe and North America. It is declaimed as the most important tax development of the latter twentieth century and certainly the most breathtaking. With its significant influence on the domestic economy and the government policies, VAT has been the heart of tax compliance issue. When claimed to be the most efficient and contributing revenue source, it is also criticized for the heavy compliance costs associated with its introduction. This paper, based on prior studies and research, continues to explore the factors influencing VAT compliance costs in the UK. The data gained by professor Hasseldine, Hansford and Howorth in their questionnaire survey is further analyzed and the factors identified as statistically significant are examined within six broadly defined industries of manufacturing, goods dealing, services, professional services, public services and others. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the extents to which size, membership of <b>VAT</b> <b>group,</b> age, methods of VAT records keeping, psychological costs, complexity and individual characteristics affecting compliance costs of these six industries are the same or different. It is proved that these factors influence different sectors to different levels, but size is still the most significant factor for the four main sectors of manufacturing, goods dealing, services and professional services. This is of implicating meaning for the policy makers. It can be inferred that it is necessary to consider industry variations when making efforts in VAT compliance costs relieves...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{conducted}} a cross-sectional study {{of body fat}} distribution and metabolic variables and the interrelations among these factors in 134 women aged 18 - 71. 9 y. Body fat distribution was measured with use of computerized tomography. A significant positive correlation was observed between age and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and between VAT and body weight. When subjects were divided into five age <b>groups,</b> <b>VAT</b> values were significantly higher in older groups. Values for triacylglyc-erols, cholesterol, fasting glucose, 2 -h glucose, and the sum of glucose values during an oral-glucose-tolerance test were signifi-cantly higher in older subjects. After adjustment for visceral fat, {{no significant differences in}} any metabolic variable studied, except cholesterol, were found across the five age groups. In conclusion, we found that regional body fat distribution in older women was different from that in younger subjects: older women had larger amounts of visceral fat. Values for metabolic variables were also higher in older subjects. Our data suggest that redistribution of body fat in older subjects is associated with changes in metabolic variables.

However, associations between indices of obesity and lipoprotein subfractions remain undetermined across different ethnic groups. ObjectiveThis study aims to examine the associations of indices of obesity in Japanese Americans, African Americans, and Koreans with lipoprotein subfractions. MethodsA population-based sample of 230 Japanese American, 91 African American, and 291 Korean men ages 40 to 49 was examined for indices of obesity—that is, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT and SAT, respectively); waist circumference; and body mass index—and for lipoprotein subfractions by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Multiple regression analyses were performed {{in each of the}} 3 ethnic groups to examine the associations of each index of obesity with lipoprotein. ConclusionsVAT had significant positive associations with total and small low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and a significant negative association with large high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in all 3 ethnicities (p < 0. 01). SAT, waist circumference, and body mass index had significant positive associations with total and small LDL in only Japanese Americans and Koreans, whereas these indices had significant inverse associations with large HDL in all ethnic groups (p < 0. 01).

We aimed to determine how daily exercise (resistance and/or aerobic) and a hypoenergetic diet varying in protein and calcium content from dairy foods would affect the composition of weight lost in otherwise healthy, premenopausal, overweight, and obese women. Ninety participants were randomized to 3 groups (n = 30 /group) : high protein, high dairy (HPHD), adequate protein, medium dairy (APMD), and adequate protein, low dairy (APLD) differing in the quantity of total dietary protein and dairy food-source protein consumed: 30 and 15 %, 15 and 7. 5 %, or 15 and < 2 % of energy, respectively. Body composition was measured by DXA at 0, 8, and 16 wk and MRI (n = 39) to assess visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volume at 0 and 16 wk. All groups lost body weight (P < 0. 05) and fat (P < 0. 01); however, fat loss during wk 8 – 16 was greater in the HPHD group than in the APMD and APLD groups (P < 0. 05). The HPHD group gained lean tissue with a greater increase during 8 – 16 wk than the APMD group, which maintained lean mass and the APLD group, which lost lean mass (P < 0. 05). The HPHD group also lost more VAT as assessed by MRI (P < 0. 05) and trunk fat as assessed by DXA (P < 0. 005) than the APLD group. The reduction in <b>VAT</b> in all <b>groups</b> was correlated with intakes of calcium (r = 0. 40; P < 0. 05) and protein (r = 0. 32; P < 0. 05).

However, after limb salvage surgery, orthopaedic tumor endoprostheses might cause significant metal-induced susceptibility artifacts. To evaluate the benefit of view-angle tilting (VAT) and slice-encoding metal artifact correction (SEMAC) for MRI of large-sized orthopaedic tumor endoprostheses in an experimental model and to demonstrate clinical benefits for assessment of periprosthetic soft tissue abnormalities. In an experimental setting, tumor endoprostheses (n= 4) were scanned at 1. 5 T with three versions of optimized high-bandwidth turbo-spin-echo pulse sequences: (i) standard, (ii) VAT and (iii) combined VAT and SEMAC (VAT&SEMAC). Pulse sequences included coronal short-tau-inversion-recovery (STIR), coronal T 1 -weighted (w), transverse T 1 -w and T 2 -w TSE sequences. For clinical evaluation, VAT&SEMAC was compared to conventional metal artifact-reducing MR sequences (conventional MR) in n= 25 patients with metal implants and clinical suspicion of tumor recurrence or infection. Diameters of artifacts were measured quantitatively. Qualitative parameters were assessed on a five-point scale (1 =best, 5 =worst) : "image distortion", "artificial signal changes at the edges" and "diagnostic confidence". Imaging findings were correlated with pathology. T-tests and Wilcoxon-signed rank tests were used for statistical analyses. The true size of the prostheses was overestimated on MRI (P< 0. 05). A significant reduction of artifacts was achieved by VAT (P< 0. 001) and VAT&SEMAC (P= 0. 003) compared to the standard group. Quantitative scores improved in the <b>VAT</b> and VAT&SEMAC <b>group</b> (P< 0. 05).

We sought to determine whether exercise-induced weight loss (EX) results in greater reductions in IMAT and VAT compared with similar weight loss induced by calorie restriction (CR) and whether these changes {{are associated with}} improvements in glucoregulation. Sedentary men and women (50 - 60 yr; body mass index of 23. 5 - 29. 9 kg/m(2)) were randomized to 1 yr of CR (n = 17), EX (n = 16), or a control group (CON; n = 6). Bilateral thigh IMAT and VAT volumes were quantified using multi-slice magnetic resonance imaging. Insulin sensitivity index (ISI) was determined from oral glucose tolerance test glucose and insulin levels. Weight loss was comparable (P = 0. 25) in the CR (- 10. 8 ± 1. 4 %) and EX groups (- 8. 3 ± 1. 5 %) and greater than {{in the control group}} (- 2. 0 ± 2. 4 %; P < 0. 05).

After controlling for differences in total fat mass change between the CR and EX <b>groups,</b> IMAT and <b>VAT</b> reductions were nearly twofold greater (P ≤ 0. 05) in the EX group than in the CR group (IMAT: - 45 ± 5 vs. - 25 ± 5 ml; VAT: - 490 ± 64 vs. - 267 ± 61 ml). In the EX group, the reductions in IMAT were correlated with increases in ISI (r = - 0. 71; P = 0. 003), whereas in the CR <b>group,</b> <b>VAT</b> reductions were correlated with increases in ISI (r = - 0. 64; P = 0. 006). In conclusion, calorie restriction and exercise-induced weight loss both decrease IMAT and VAT volumes. However, exercise appears to result in preferential reductions in these fat depots...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{tax policy}} and tax reforms in Uganda. Using household survey evidence, the paper identifies which taxes are progressive and investigates whether tax reforms {{have made the}} poor better or worse off. Household survey analysis reveals {{that some of the}} tax reforms implemented in the 1990 s were generally pro-poor. The paper also examines business taxation and the actual tax burden on firms’ capital investment. The analysis demonstrates that, even when the country’s level of public revenue is low at the macroeconomic level, rapidly increasing taxation may pose a constraint to private investment at the microeconomic level.

40|$|Background. Sleep apnoea {{frequently}} affects {{patients with}} end-stage renal disease. However, {{it is still}} unclear whether or to what extent sleep disorders may affect functional capacity {{and quality of life}} in haemodialysis patients. We tested the hypothesis that apneic dialysis patients {{due to the lack of}} restorative sleep will have a further reduced functional capacity and further compromised quality of life compared to their non-apneic counterparts. Methods. Forty-three clinically stable haemodialysis patients (13 F, 56. 6 +/- 19. 4 years) were examined. After polysomnographic analysis, patients were divided in two groups according to their calculated apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI; cutoff 5). Primary outcomes were intergroup differences in the following: (1) physical capacity and muscle performance, assessed by functional tests, (2) quality of life, assessed by the SF- 36, (3) body composition, measured by DEXA and (4) muscle composition and size, as well as (5) visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue, calculated by computed tomography. Results. Twenty-two patients had AHI > 5 (4 F, AHI = 28. 8 +/- 22. 3). The adjusted analysis for age, BMI and years in dialysis therapy, showed that the low-AHI group (N = 21, 9 F, AHI = 1. 8 +/- 1. 3) had better functional capacity, and performed better in muscle strength and endurance tests compared to the high-AHI group. There were no differences in lean body mass and total body fat between groups, however, values for VAT, VAT/TAT ratio and thigh muscles fat infiltration were increased in the high-AHI <b>group.</b> <b>VAT</b> correlated with BMI (r = 0. 682, P = 0. 001), functional capacity (r = 0. 558, P = 0. 001) apnoea hypopnoea index (r = 0. 530, P = 0. 001). There were no statistical significant differences in quality of life between the two groups. To further account for age and BMI differences, a subgroup of patients was matched by age, sex and BMI (N = 10 /group). In the matched analysis, all the above statistical differences remained, between the low-AHI and high-AHI groups. Conclusions. Haemodialysis patients with sleep apnoea syndrome demonstrate poorer functional capacity, physical performance and muscle composition, compared to non-apneic dialysis patients. Overall, sleep apnoea appears to partly contribute to the total diminished functional capacity of haemodialysis patients...|$|R
