50|$|There {{are some}} {{solutions}} {{to this issue}} that are now used in modern pedal systems.

Adding a <b>vigilance</b> <b>function</b> {{to this type of}} pedal results in a very safe system. However, isolation devices are still provided in case of equipment failure, so a deliberate override is still possible. These isolation devices usually have tamper-evident seals fitted for that reason.|$|E
40|$|Generalized {{adaptive}} resonance theory (GART) is a neural network model {{that is capable of}} online learning and is effective in tackling pattern classification tasks. In this paper, we propose an improved GART model (IGART), and demonstrate its applicability to power systems. IGART enhances the dynamics of GART in several aspects, which include the use of the Laplacian likelihood function, a new <b>vigilance</b> <b>function,</b> a new match-tracking mechanism, an ordering algorithm for determining the sequence of training data, and a rule extraction capability to elicit if-then rules from the network. To assess the effectiveness of IGART and to compare its performances with those from other methods, three datasets that are related to power systems are employed. The experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of IGART with the rule extraction capability in undertaking classification problems in power systems engineering. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{theoretical}} paper {{addresses the}} cognitive functions via which quiet {{and in general}} pleasurable sounds promote and annoying sounds impede health. The article comprises a literature analysis and an interpretation of how the bidirectional influence of appraising {{the environment and the}} feelings of the perceiver can be understood in terms of core affect and motivation. This conceptual basis allows the formulation of a detailed cognitive model describing how sonic content, related to indicators of safety and danger, either allows full freedom over mind-states or forces the activation of a <b>vigilance</b> <b>function</b> with associated arousal. The model leads to a number of detailed predictions {{that can be used to}} provide existing soundscape approaches with a solid cognitive science foundation that may lead to novel approaches to soundscape design. These will take into account that louder sounds typically contribute to distal situational awareness while subtle environmental sounds provide proximal situational awareness. The role of safety indicators, mediated by proximal situational awareness and subtle sounds, should become more important in future soundscape research...|$|E
40|$|Although {{many studies}} of {{vigilance}} examine head raising in foraging, grooming or resting animals, pauses during intermittent locomotion are rarely considered {{from the perspective}} of vigilance, and no studies have compared head raising and pausing in the same system. We videotaped central place foraging chipmunks, Tamias striatus, as they approached a patch, collected sunflower seeds, and left to return to their burrows. There was a strong similarity between head raising during foraging and pausing during intermittent locomotion. Chipmunks paused more frequently when moving towards the patch than when leaving the patch. Chipmunks in the patch raised their heads at an intermediate rate, which tended to decrease with time in the patch. Pauses and the duration of motionless periods during head raises were very short (w 0. 4 s), and their frequency distributions were similar. Animals remained motionless during 22 % of the time spent approaching the patch, 14 % of the time spent in the patch and 7 % of the time spent leaving the patch. Rates of pausing and head raising generally decreased with short-term familiarity (number of trips to the patch) and with long-term familiarity (proximity of the patch to the burrow). Trials with higher pause rates when approaching the patch had higher head-raising rates in the patch. Whether the focal individual was solitary, dominant or subordinate in a dyad, or competing with multiple chipmunks in the patch had no effect on pausing or head raising. In a separate experiment, exposure to a model hawk increased pause and head-raising rates. We conclude that head raising during foraging and pausing during locomotion serve a similar <b>vigilance</b> <b>function,</b> that this vigilance is directed towards detection of predators rather than conspecifics, and that time allocated to vigilance is sufficient to significantly reduce foraging rates and affect many space use and foraging decisions...|$|E

40|$|Minimal hepatic {{encephalopathy}} (MHE) is the earliest form of {{hepatic encephalopathy}} and can affect up to 80 % of cirrhotic patients.

40|$|International audiencePatients with obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) show neuropsychological {{impairments}} ranging from vigilance decrements, attentional lapses and memory gaps to decreased motor coordination, but their cognitive profile, and {{the origin of the}} impairments, remain unclear. We sought to establish the neuropsychological profile of 16 newly diagnosed apneics and to highlight both their morphological and functional brain abnormalities. We used an extensive neuropsychological test battery to investigate attention and <b>vigilance,</b> executive <b>functions,</b> episodic memory and motor domains. For brain imaging, we used the optimized voxel-based morphometry procedure for the MRI data, resting-state (18) F-fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-Glucose positron emission tomography ((18) FDG-PET) with correction for partial volume effects (PVEs) and voxel-based analyses. In terms of neurobehavioral performance, our patients displayed objective daytime somnolence but little impairment in memory and motor domains. Cerebral data revealed gray matter loss in the frontal and temporo-parieto-occipital cortices, the thalamus, hippocampal region, some basal ganglia and cerebellar regions, mainly in the right hemisphere. The decrease in brain metabolism was also right-lateralized, but more restricted than the gray matter density changes, and involved the precuneus, the middle and posterior cingulate gyrus, and the parieto-occipital cortex, as well as the prefrontal cortex. To conclude, despite the presence of only minor memory and motor impairments, our patients displayed significant cerebral changes in terms of both gray matter density and metabolic levels, and may have benefited from cognitive reserve and compensatory mechanisms. Thus, cerebral changes in OSA patients may precede the onset of notable neuropsychological consequences...|$|R
40|$|Attention and {{executive}} functions were investigated in medicated and unmedicated children with ADHD combined type using a novel selective reaching task. This task involved responding {{as rapidly as}} possible to a target while at times having to ignore a distractor. Results indicated that unmedicated children with ADHD showed slow and inaccurate responding. Slow responding reflected problems at the stage of movement preparation but not movement execution. An attentional impairment, rather than a motor planning problem per se, appeared to underlie the slow movement preparation. Inaccurate responding reflected problems with response inhibition and selective attention, impulsivity, set- shifting, and difficulties in maintaining vigilance. Although medicated children with ADHD did not show slow movement preparation, they did show some response inaccuracy, resulting especially from impulsive responding. These findings suggest that ADHD is characterized by slow motor preparation (but not motor execution), and deficits in selective attention, <b>vigilance,</b> {{and executive}} <b>functions.</b> Preliminary results suggest that stimulant medication may resolve some of these motor, attentional and executive function deficits...|$|R
40|$|Background: To present {{preparedness}} planning for an influenza pandemic for two nursing subunits: nursing services {{in hospitals and}} schools of nursing in universities. Discussion: The preparedness plan is modeled on a modified Haddon matrix, a logical approach to identify measures appropriate for the pre-event, event, and postevent phases of an influenza pandemic. For the pre-event phase, {{the objective is to}} ensure preparedness for the potential pandemic outbreak through training, communication, surveillance, infection control, and vaccination. Once the pandemic outbreak is declared, the aim is to implement effective measures to ensure a rapid and appropriate response. For the postevent phase, the plan is focused on the restoration of core <b>functions,</b> <b>vigilance</b> for a second or possibly more waves of the pandemic, and psychosocial support to staff and students. Conclusion: Measures required to prepare for, respond to, and manage the consequences of influenza pandemic are identified.

40|$|UNLABELLED: Although the {{functions}} of sleep remain to be fully elucidated, {{it is clear that}} there are far-reaching effects of its disruption, whether by curtailment for a single night, by a few hours each night over a long period, or by disruption in sleep continuity. Epidemiological and experimental studies of these different forms of sleep disruption show deranged physiology from subcellular levels to complex affective behavior. In keeping with the multifaceted influence of sleep on health and well-being, we illustrate how the duration of sleep, its timing, and continuity can affect cellular ultrastructure, gene expression, metabolic and hormone regulation, mood, and vigilance. Recent brain imaging studies provide some clues on mechanisms underlying {{the most common cause of}} disrupted sleep (insomnia). These insights should ultimately result in adequate interventions to prevent and treat sleep disruption because of their high relevance to our most prevalent health problems.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of acute physical activity on cognitive tasks of 37, 7 th and 8 th grade females. Subjects' cognitive performance following acute physical activity was hypothesized to be significantly better on five tasks (choice reaction time, probed memory, dual task, <b>vigilance,</b> executive <b>function)</b> used in the study, with {{no significant difference in}} performance hypothesized for the sixth (simple reaction time). The study assessed cognitive tasks twice, following a 30 minute sedentary period and 30 minutes of physical activity. The within subject design compared the independent variable of physical activity level (activity or none) on the dependent variables simple reaction time, choice reaction time, dual task-tracking and simple reaction time, vigilance, probed memory, and executive function. Results indicated that for the simple reaction time task subjects demonstrated significantly faster (reaction and movement) times following acute physical activity. For choice reaction time the percent of correct responses was significantly higher following sedentary behavior, while for choice reaction and movement time, subjects were significantly faster following acute physical activity. Analysis of probed memory reported no significance between the scores following the two activity sessions. Analysis of dual task reported no significance for two subcomponents, however a significant difference was reported for the third subcomponent. Analysis of vigilance reported subjects demonstrated significantly improved performance on two subcomponents following physical activity. Analysis of the third subcomponent did not report significance. Performance on the executive function task was mixed with no significance reported for subjects between the following physical activity and following sedentary behavior scores, while significance was reported with regard to time to complete the task. Levels of significance were not reached for every task, however there was a trend consistent with expectations for those that did not reach significance (With the exception of choice reaction time percentage of correct responses.), following physical activity, performance was better...|$|R
40|$|Loss of {{attention}} with time-on-task reflects the increasing instability of the waking state during performance in experimentally induced sleepiness. To determine whether patients with disorders of excessive sleepiness also displayed time-on-task decrements indicative of wake state instability, visual sustained attention performance on "Steer Clear," a computerized simple RT driving simulation task, was compared among 31 patients with untreated sleep apnea, 16 patients with narcolepsy, and 14 healthy control subjects. <b>Vigilance</b> decrement <b>functions</b> were generated {{by analyzing the}} number of collisions in each of six four-minute periods of Steer Clear task performance in a mixed-model analysis of variance and linear regression equations. As expected, patients had more Steer Clear collisions than control subjects (p= 0. 006). However, the inter-subject variability in errors among the narcoleptic patients was four-fold that of the apnea patients, and 100 -fold that of the controls volunteers; the variance in errors among untreated apnea patients was 27 -times that of controls. The results of transformed collision data revealed main effects for group (p= 0. 006), time-on-task (p= 0. 001), and a significant interaction (p= 0. 022). Control subjects showed no clear evidence of increasing collision errors with time-on-task (adjusted R 2 = 0. 22), while apnea patients showed a trend toward vigilance decrement (adjusted R 2 = 0. 42, p= 0. 097), and narcolepsy patients evidenced a robust linear vigilance decrement (adjusted R 2 = 0. 87, p= 0. 004). The association of disorders of excessive somnolence with escalating time-on-task decrements makes it imperative that when assessment of neurobehavioral performance is conducted in patients, it involves task durations and analyses that will evaluate the underlying vulnerability of potentially sleepy patients to decrements over time in tasks that require sustained attention and timely responses, {{both of which are}} key components in safe driving performance...|$|R
40|$|Background: Minimal hepatic {{encephalopathy}} (MHE) is a neuro-cognitive dysfunction characterized by impairment in attention, <b>vigilance</b> and integrative <b>functions,</b> while the sensorimotor function was often unaffected. Little is known, so far, about the exact neuro-pathophysiological mechanisms of aberrant cognition function in this disease. Methodology/Principal Findings: To investigate {{how the brain}} function is changed in MHE, we applied a resting-state fMRI approach with independent component analysis (ICA) to assess the differences of resting-state networks (RSNs) between MHE patients and healthy controls. Fourteen MHE patients and 14 age-and sex-matched healthy subjects underwent resting-state fMRI scans. ICA was used to identify six RSNs [dorsal attention network (DAN), default mode network (DMN), visual network (VN), auditory network (AN), sensorimotor network (SMN), self-referential network (SRN) ] in each subject. Group maps of each RSN were compared between the MHE and healthy control groups. Pearson correlation analysis was performed between the RSNs functional connectivity (FC) and venous blood ammonia levels, and neuropsychological tests scores for all patients. Compared with the healthy controls, MHE patients showed significantly decreased FC in DAN, both decreased and increased FC in DMN, AN and VN.

40|$|Acute high {{altitude}} (HA) exposure compromises cognitive function thus posing a significant {{risk to personnel}} safety in a HA environment, particularly when performing tasks that requires cognitive <b>vigilance.</b> Normal cerebral <b>function,</b> and thus cognitive function, is dependent upon oxygen supply. At HA there is reduced oxygen availability results in compensatory increases in cerebrovascular blood flow which {{may be related to}} nitric oxide (NO), a primary signaling molecule that acts to increase blood flow and ensure an optimal neurovascular coupling (NVC). Upon initial ascent to HA, however, there may be reductions in NO production which {{may play a role in}} acute decrements in cerebrovascular/cognitive function at HA. Dietary nitrate may serve as a means to replenish NO availability. Increasing NO in this manner could have positive effects on NVC during increased cognitive demand.

In the current study, 31 patients with schizophrenia and 29 healthy controls, matched on age, gender, education and premorbid verbal intelligence, underwent a BADE task. Written scenarios of three consecutive sentences each were presented, which progressively reduced the ambiguity of situations. Participants were asked to rate the plausibility of four possible interpretations and adjust their ratings in response to the provided sentences. Psychometric rating scales and a neuropsychological test battery were applied. Patients displayed a bias in the integration of confirmatory, but not disconfirmatory evidence and a liberal acceptance of belief formation. Correlation analyses revealed no associations of evidence integration with the severity of positive symptoms, but with neurocognitive domains, especially with processing speed, executive <b>functioning,</b> <b>vigilance</b> and working memory. In conclusion, patients with schizophrenia show a bias in evidence integration. Neurocognitive functioning emerged as a modulatory factor that should be considered in further research.

40|$|After {{being kept}} in captivity and {{isolated}} from natural predators {{for more than}} 1, 200 years, Père David’s deer has been reintroduced in China and now occurs in a reserve where human activity is the only potential threat. Antipredator vigilance {{is an important component}} of survival for many prey animals in their natural habitat. Do deer still adjust <b>vigilance</b> as a <b>function</b> of risk after such a long period of relaxed predation pressure? Here, we examined vigilance levels in Père David’s deer groups as a function of group size, sex and level of human disturbance. The results showed that individual vigilance significantly decreased with group size in all-female groups but not in all-males or mixed-sex groups. In rutting season, males compete with one another and harass females, and we argue that vigilance is partly aimed at threatening males and that such vigilance increases with group size. This explains why overall vigilance did not vary with group size for males in general and for females in mixed-sex groups. Vigilance increased in more disturbed areas but in in male deer only. The results indicate that despite relaxed predation pressure over centuries, Père David’s deer can still adjust antipredator responses as a function of perceived risk.

40|$|Abstract Background Relationships between {{cognitive}} {{deficits and}} brain morphological changes observed in schizophrenia are alternately explained by less gray {{matter in the}} brain cerebral cortex, by alterations in neural circuitry involving the basal ganglia, and by alteration in cerebellar structures and related neural circuitry. This work explored a model encompassing all of these possibilities to identify the strongest morphological relationships to cognitive skill in schizophrenia. Methods Seventy-one patients with schizophrenia and sixty-five healthy control subjects were characterized by neuropsychological tests covering six functional domains. Measures of sixteen brain morphological structures were taken using semi-automatic and fully manual tracing of MRI images, with the full set of measures completed on thirty of the patients and twenty controls. Group differences were calculated. A Bayesian decision-theoretic method identified those morphological features, which best explained neuropsychological test scores {{in the context of}} a multivariate response linear model with interactions. Results Patients performed significantly worse on all neuropsychological tests except some regarding executive function. The most prominent morphological observations were enlarged ventricles, reduced posterior superior vermis gray matter volumes, and increased putamen gray matter volumes in the patients. The Bayesian method associated putamen volumes with verbal learning, vigilance, and (to a lesser extent) executive function, while caudate volumes were associated with working memory. Vermis regions were associated with <b>vigilance,</b> executive <b>function,</b> and, less strongly, visuo-motor speed. Ventricular volume was strongly associated with visuo-motor speed, vocabulary, and executive function. Those neuropsychological tests, which were strongly associated to ventricular volume, showed only weak association to diagnosis, possibly because ventricular volume was regarded a proxy for diagnosis. Diagnosis was strongly associated with the other neuropsychological tests, implying that the morphological associations for these tasks reflected morphological effects and not merely group volumetric differences. Interaction effects were rarely associated, indicating that volumetric relationships to neuropsychological performance were similar for both patients and controls. Conclusion The association of subcortical and cerebellar structures to verbal learning, vigilance, and working memory supports the importance of neural connectivity to these functions. The finding that a morphological indicator of diagnosis (ventricular volume) provided more explanatory power than diagnosis itself for visuo-motor speed, vocabulary, and executive function suggests that volumetric abnormalities in the disease are more important for cognition than non-morphological features. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} impact of obstructive sleep apnea {{syndrome}} (OSAS), obesity and hypothyroidism and their potential synergic effect on sleep pattern, <b>vigilance</b> and cognitive <b>functioning.</b> Methods: Fifty OSAS patients and twenty age, sex and BMI matched healthy controls underwent in lab nocturnal polysomnography, multi- ple latency sleep test, standardized questionnaires for sleep quality, fatigue, sleepiness, TSH, fT 3 and fT 4 evaluation and neuropsycho- logical tests. Subjects were divided in four groups: non obese OSAS, obese OSAS, hypothyroid OSAS patients and healthy controls. Results: Hypothyroid OSAS showed worse scores in subjective sleep quality and fatigue compared with controls and non obese OSAS, with a positive correlation between TSH level and Fatigue Severity Scale and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Mean daily sleep latency was signiﬁcantly lower in all three clinical population as compared to control, while single naps latencies were different mainly for hypothyroid OSAS. Neuropsychological testing pointed out no signiﬁcant differences among the three OSAS groups, but OSAS patients, considered as a whole, showed decreased performances in attentive and executive frontal tasks, compared with healthy controls. Sleep efﬁciency and Wake After Sleep Onset and microstructural sleep variables showed signiﬁcant correlations with attentive and executive frontal tasks. Conclusions: Sleepiness and perceived fatigue occur particularly in hypothyroid OSAS patients. Cognitive deﬁcit was similar among the three OSAS groups and impaired compared with healthy controls. The observed correlation between neuropsychological examination and macro and microstructural variables suggest a role of sleep disruption, more than respiratory disturbance per se, on cognition...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chronic sleep {{restriction}} {{is common}} globally and has well documented {{negative effects on}} psychobehavioral and metabolic function. This review assesses research {{on the amount of}} sleep recovery needed to repair subjective sleepiness and lapses in psychomotor vigilance. Methods: An exhaustive search of MEDLINE-Ovid, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases was performed in July 2016 using the keywords “sleep restriction” and “sleep recovery”. The referenced works of qualifying articles were assessed for previously unidentified sources. Inclusion criteria were published full text papers with a combination of sleep restriction and a recovery period, that assessed psychomotor vigilance and subjective sleepiness. The included articles were graded for quality following GRADE workgroup guidelines. Results: Four studies met inclusion criteria with GRADE scores ranging from very low to high for the 2 outcomes of psychomotor vigilance and subjective sleepiness. Two nights of 8 - 10 hours time-in-bed (TIB) is sufficient to return measures of subjective sleepiness to baseline. No study had follow up long enough to demonstrate a return to baseline level of psychomotor <b>vigilance</b> testing (PVT) <b>function.</b> PVT lapses decreased within 3 days of recovery sleep but persisted at an increased level from baseline.

40|$|The {{symptoms}} which {{develop in}} well-managed patients with acute or chronic progressive renal failure comprise the neurobehavioral syndrome, uremic encephalopathy. Interfering with <b>vigilance,</b> cognitive <b>functions,</b> and ultimately consciousness, these symptoms impose significant disability unless dialysis treatment can reverse and suppress them or a successful renal transplant provides {{the patient with}} virtually normal renal function, and, consequently, complete symptomatic recovery. This apparent connection between disability as a neurobeha-vioral “encephalic” disorder and its response to dialysis prompted our attempts to apply quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) measures as indices of the “toxic encephalopathy” of renal failure and of its response to “standard” dialysis regimens and to transplantation. Subsequent work indicates that EEG measures are sensitive to varying amounts or intensity of maintenance dialysis, to changes in modality of dialysis, for example, the shift from conventional prescriptions of maintenance hemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis, CAPD, CCPD, and so forth, or to effects within individual dialysis sessions in cases of dialysis disequilibrium. These findings invite the prospect that one may objectively assess at least the relative adequacy of different levels and modalities of dialysis in individual patients using objective indices which are particularly relevant both to the symptomatic disability of renal failure on one hand, and to the symptomatic improvement evoked by dialysis on the other. Therefore, {{in this article we}} describe the use of computer-based methods for the evaluation of uremic encephalopathy and its response to treatment. Examples are given in which such computerized evaluations have guided decisions about treatment, particularly to assure sufficient dialysis to suppress even the milder manifestations of the dialysis-responses, clinical uremic syndrome. The purpose of the article is to dispel the mystique that has surrounded the use of the computer for evaluation of EEGs recorded from renal patients. The methods described below were designed specifically for use with EEGs recorded from renal patients and should not be considered as a replacement for a trained EEG scorer. Visual scoring of the EEG provides a comprehensive examination of an EEG record that is unlikely ever to be matched by any computer program. Hence, the methods described should be viewed simply as a quantitative evaluation tool for a limited range of significant features in EEGs secured from a rather select population. We hope the practical information given can be used to guide physicians as they begin to incorporate the methods described into their everyday practice. A survey {{of the history of the}} use of computers in the evaluation of electroencephalograms recorded from patients with renal disorders is given as well as a critical evaluation of computer methods employed in past approaches.

The seated inversion posture is useful in simulating the environments that astronauts are exposed to in microgravity conditions as well as environments that humans may be exposed to during normal daily routines. Many recreational and labor related inverted positions occur in the air, outer space, {{as well as on}} or under water. Vigilance is required to complete activities of daily living, extra-curricular activities as in avoidance of and escape from life threatening conditions. <b>Vigilance</b> encompasses the <b>functions</b> of cognition, attention, alertness, and decision making skills that a re required to maintain upright posture and balance as well as required to ensure proper accuracy and perception when solving problems. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the effects of an inverted posture on variables of vigilance, heart rate and blood pressure. Eight males completed 5 sessions of assessment. Heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP), as well as vigilance tasks and reaction time were assessed first in a seated upright posture, followed by the seated inverted postures, and again a seated upright posture. Intraclass correlation coefficients for Tower of London (ToL), Selective Attention and Response Competition (SARC), anxiety, Heart Rate (HR), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) were excellent (R> 0. 95). The inverted condition produced significant (p< 0. 0001) decrements in performance on The Tower of London (ToL) tests and Selective Attention and Response Competition test. Time to completion was significantly slower in (63. 4 % and 40. 7 %) the ToL during the inverted condition as compared to the pre and post upright assessments.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of the present thesis was to {{evaluate}} a pupillometric test (the 5 minute Pupillary Alertness Test - 5 -min PAT) as an objective measure of subjective daytime sleepiness (EDS). For this reason, we examined its sensitivity to modafinil, an alertness promoting drug which is commonly prescribed {{for the treatment of}} EDS. We also compared the 5 -min PAT test with the gold standard MSLT in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We showed that the test is sensitive to physiologic circadian rhythms, it distinguishes apneic patients from healthy controls, it is sensitive to OSA severity and to the alertness promoting effects of modafinil, while it correlates well with ΜSLT. The 5 -min PAT test seems to reflect different aspects of arousal in comparison with MSLT, it is easily repeatable and it is a simple, low cost, easy and quick to administer and score. For these reasons, the 5 -min PAT test is a promising clinical tool for the assessment of daytime sleepiness and its severity, and perhaps for the monitoring of the course of OSA after CPAP treatment, something that is important to be determined in future research. We also compared {{for the first time the}} levels of alexithymia in a non-depressed, non-mentally ill sample of OSA patients with that of a control group which was one-to-one matched for age, gender, education and subjective depressive symptomatology. We found higher alexithymia levels in our OSA group even after the exclusion of all patient-control pairs at the high end of subjective depressive symptomatology (as measured with the Beck Depression Inventory - BDI- 21). Additionally, as OSA is expected to impair <b>vigilance</b> and executive <b>functioning</b> owing to the sensitivity of the prefrontal cortex to the effects of sleep fragmentation and intermittent hypoxia, we examined the pattern of cognitive dysfunction using 3 separate neuropsychological tests based on prefrontal cortical function. We found deficits in working memory, planning for emotional decision making and planning for problem solving. Finally, we evaluated several neurobiologically founded and heritable personality dimensions in OSA patients but found no difference compared to matched controls, when we excluded those with the higher scores in subjective depressive symptomatology with the exception of higher “Harm Avoidance”. These original findings have important implications for diagnosis, clinical assessment and treatment plan as well as in disease and treatment monitoring. ...|$|R
40|$|Health related {{quality of}} life (HRQOL) is a {{relevant}} outcome measure for patients admitted to {{the intensive care unit}} (ICU). Long term outcome for physical and psychological factors, functional status and social interactions {{are becoming more and more}} important both for doctors and nurses as well as for patients and their relatives (1; 2). Therefore doctors and nurses want to know what a “reasonable” {{quality of life}} means to their patients. The main reason for HRQOL research described in this thesis is the lack of knowledge about the outcome of HRQOL in critically ill patients admitted to an ICU. Especially, the time course of changes in HRQOL following discharge from the ICU and during a general ward stay has not been studied. In HRQOL studies in general as well ass in critically ill patients, there is a lack of a clear framework for defining and describing HRQOL. One of the difficulties in HRQOL research is defining what one means by health related quality of life: there is no universally accepted definition. QOL, health status, functional status, and HRQOL are often used interchangeable in the literature (3). Yet each of these terms may reflect different aspects of an individual’s well-being (4). This also may lead to different measurement approaches which may lead to different results. Quality of life is described as a “unique personal perception” (5), influenced by social, psychological, cultural, familial, relational and individual factors. The World Health Organization defines “health” as not only the absence of infirmity and disease but also as a state of physical, mental and social well-being (6). Accordingly, an assessment of health related quality of life should reflect the patients’ physiological and psychological status, social functioning and perception of health. The quality of life applied to health, or HRQOL, takes into account not all dimensions of the quality of life, but those that can be changed by the disease or its treatment. Finally, quality of life may be defined as a concept encompassing a broad range of physical and psychological characteristics and limitations that describe an individual’s ability to function in their environment and derive satisfaction from so doing. Health related quality of life describes the level of well-being of the individual’s life as affected by accident, injury, disease and treatments (7). Recent studies in critically ill patients have measured HRQOL, but an evaluation of conceptual issues is usually missing. In Chapter 2. we therefore discussed conceptual issues specifically related to HRQOL measurement in critically ill patients such as: “why measure HRQOL in critically ill patients?”; “how to define and standardize domains of HRQOL?”, “what utility measures are used in research pertaining critically ill patients?”; “can proxies provide useful information about HRQOL in critically ill patients?”; “does response shift occur in critically ill patients?” and “do post-traumatic stress disorders occur in critically ill patients?”. Evaluating these specific conceptual issues did not yield conclusive results. Some studies reported moderate agreement between patients and their proxies, although lower levels of agreement may be reported for psychosocial or physical <b>functioning.</b> <b>Vigilance</b> for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) is needed and early interventions implemented to prevent PTSD. Nursing care while in the ICU and intensive care follow-up may have an important role in recognizing and treatment of psychological problems after hospital discharge. Furthermore, response shift seems an important phenomenon and likely to be present, but is seldom measured when estimating HRQOL in critically ill patients...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science by ResearchProlonged exercise-heat-stress impairs both exercise performance and cognitive function. Military based operations are often performed in hot environmental conditions and thus performance and safety may be compromised which could be potentially life threatening. Acute ingestion of tyrosine (TYR), a catecholamine precursor, {{has been shown to}} improve aspects of cognitive function and mood during exposure to stressful environments, in military and sport specific settings. Currently, there is limited research exploring the optimal dose of TYR relative to blood values, to prescribe pre-exercise or before exposure to a stressor. Therefore, the purpose of experimental chapter 1 was to investigate the effects of acute TYR ingestion strategies (0, 150 and 300 mg. kg body mass- 1 TYR administered in 2 equal doses, 4 h apart) on serum TYR concentrations at rest. Twenty-one healthy males were randomly allocated to one of three groups (n = 7 per group); HIGH (300 mg. kg body mass- 1 TYR in total), LOW (150 mg. kg body mass- 1 TYR in total) and CON (sugar free squash placebo). Ingestion of TYR was double blinded and was administered in a drink form (dissolved in 250 mL sugar free squash) in two separate doses at both 0900 and 1300. Participants consumed a standardized breakfast (0800) and lunch (1200) prior to consumption of TYR and remained in the laboratory from 0900 - 1700 having blood drawn every hour from a cannula. Measures of gastric discomfort were also recorded. Significant differences in serum TYR concentrations were observed between groups (p 0. 05). No significant differences in gastric discomfort were observed between groups (p > 0. 05). This study demonstrates that ingestion of a single dose of 150 mg. kg body mass- 1 TYR may be sufficient to elevate serum TYR concentrations and that the peak in TYR concentration typically occurs 2 h post ingestion (without the need for a second identical dose 4 h later). Experimental chapter 2 was designed to investigate the effects of TYR ingestion on steady state exercise, cognitive function and time-trial performance in the heat, utilising the identified dose from the findings of experimental chapter 1. Eight recreationally active, healthy males visited the laboratory on four occasions (two familiarisation and two experimental conditions). In a double-blind, counter-balanced, crossover design participants ingested a placebo [PLA (250 mL sugar free squash) ] or TYR (same as PLA plus 150 mg. kg body mass- 1 TYR powder) 1 h pre-exercise. Participants completed a 60 min walk at 6. 5 km. h, followed by a 2. 4 km time-trial carrying a 25 kg backpack in 40 °C; 30 % RH. Cognitive <b>function</b> (<b>vigilance,</b> dual-task and simple reaction time) was assessed at 5 time-points; pre-ingestion, pre-exercise, 30 min into exercise, post 60 min exercise and post time-trial. Traditional physiological (HR), perceptual (RPE, TSS) and temperature (rectal and skin temperature) measures were recorded throughout exercise. A significant increase from pre-post exercise (p 0. 05). Furthermore, no significant difference was observed in time-trial completion time (F 1, 14 = 547. 9, p = 0. 74) between TYR (19. 78 ± 3. 44 min) and PLA (20. 29 ± 3. 55 min). No significant differences were observed in any of the physiological, perceptual or temperature measures between conditions (p > 0. 05). The main findings presented within this thesis indicate that although it was identified that a single dose of 150 mg. kg body mass- 1 was sufficient to significantly elevate serum TYR concentrations, ingestion of this dose did not influence cognitive function or time-trial performance in the heat. This is surprising since ingestion of similar doses have significantly improved aspects of cognitive function previously during exercise-heat-stress. In conclusion it appears that under the conditions of the present study, TYR is not a useful ergogenic aid. Future research should aim to elucidate the central effects of TYR to enable a better understanding of its mechanistic properties.
