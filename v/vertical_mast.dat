50|$|The colony's {{lightweight}} Bermuda cedar vessels {{were widely}} prized for their agility and speed, especially upwind.

Bermudian work boats, mostly small sloops, were ubiquitous on the archipelago's waters in the 19th century, moving freight, people, and everything else about. The rig was eventually adopted almost universally on small sailing craft in the 20th Century, although as seen on most modern vessels {{it is very much}} less extreme than on traditional Bermudian designs, with lower, <b>vertical</b> <b>masts,</b> shorter booms, omitted bowsprits, and much less area of canvas.|$|R

50|$|In 1937-38 Effingham {{was given}} an {{extensive}} modernization which radically changed her appearance.

The forwardmost three of these were superfiring, necessitating an extra superstructure deck built in front of the bridge, which was itself rebuilt. She also received four 4-inch AA guns in single mountings (in 1939 these were removed and replaced by two twin mountings), the torpedo tubes were removed, and she received a crane for handling aircraft, though the proposed aircraft catapult was not fitted and she never actually carried an aircraft. Similar modernisations had been planned for her sisters Frobisher and Hawkins, but were postponed and then cancelled due to the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|R

50|$|Even still, the Bermuda sloop {{became a}} highly popular boat form. This is {{particularly}} {{due to the}} European Bermudians use of boats as the primary means of moving about their gusty archipelago into the 20th century. Additionally, the rig was as useful in maintaining trade and emigration links to the North American colonies, directly upwind to the West (prevailing wind direction is to the East), which were and remain Bermuda's primary trading partners. After European Bermudians turned wholesale from agriculture to a maritime economy following {{the dissolution of the}} Somers Isles Company in 1684, the windward capabilities of Bermudian vessels became the primary enabler of the salt industry which was to be the central leg of Bermuda's economy for the next century. Bermuda sloop design strongly influenced the development of vessels built by the Chesapeake builders, and Bermudian features like the raked mast began to appear in American schooners.

The reasons for installing this type of antenna were also idealistic as well as technical. All other radio ships employed either <b>vertical</b> <b>mast</b> antennas, or horizontal antennas slung between fore and aft masts. These antenna types produced strong skywaves that could potentially cause interference to distant stations, especially at night.

40|$|Thermistor {{observations}} {{taken at}} Jämtön, Sweden {{and at other}} IRF (Swedish Institute of Space Physics) stations exhibit two basic types of temperature oscillations. One type is observed {{in the summer and}} forms in association with severe convective thunderstorms. This {{is the subject of this}} paper. The other type forms primarily during stable surface boundary layer conditions in winter following the arrival of infrasonic pressure waves from the Concorde supersonic transport (Liszka, 1974, Liszka and Waldemark, 1995). The observed summer temperature oscillations as recorded on <b>vertical</b> <b>masts</b> of thermistors (at heights of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and at 5 m) are very large in amplitude (about 5 - 10 K). and appear coupled in some way to the presence of severe convective thunderstorms. In order to predict future conditions, we have used a one-dimensional boundary layer model (BLMARC), properly initialized, to examine the surface and planetary boundary layer behavior during this type of event. The model predicts a bursting type event (ReVelle, 1993) about 1 hour after the model initialization, in very good agreement with the onset of the observed temperature oscillations. It also predicts an amplitude envelope for the mean temperature field that encompasses the full range of the temperature oscillation amplitudes that are found in the thermistor data. Possible causes of this behavior are examined...|$|R
5000|$|For medium-wave (AM) broadcasting, quarter-wave masts {{are between}} 153 ft and 463 ft high, {{depending}} on the frequency. Because such tall masts can be costly and uneconomic, other types of antennas are often used, which employ capacitive top-loading (electrical lengthening) to achieve equivalent signal strength with <b>vertical</b> <b>masts</b> shorter than a quarter wavelength. [...] A [...] "top hat" [...] of radial wires is occasionally added {{to the top of}} mast radiators, to allow the mast to be made shorter. For local broadcast stations and amateur stations of under 5 kW, T- and L-antennas are often used, which consist of one or more horizontal wires suspended between two masts, attached to a vertical radiator wire. A popular choice for lower-powered stations is the umbrella antenna, which needs only one mast one-tenth wavelength or less in height. This antenna uses a single mast insulated from ground and fed at the lower end against ground. At the top of the mast, radial top-load wires are connected (usually about six) which slope downwards at an angle of 40-45 degrees as far as about one-third of the total height, where they are terminated in insulators and thence outwards to ground anchors. Thus the umbrella antenna uses the guy wires as the top-load part of the antenna. In all these antennas the smaller radiation resistance of the short radiator is increased by the capacitance added by the wires attached {{to the top of the}} antenna.|$|R
50|$|Radio 390 {{was named}} after the station's wavelength, so {{listeners}} would know where to tune. The actual wavelength was 388 metres (773 kHz), but 390 was easier to remember. Like its neighbour, Radio City, Radio 390 {{took advantage of the}} fort's layout by erecting a 250-foot <b>vertical</b> <b>mast</b> on an inner tower, guyed to three of the outer towers. This, with additional elevation from the height of the towers, gave a stable and efficient antenna, better than ship-based stations, ensuring coverage of southern England with only a 10 kilowatt transmitter.

50|$|A {{helicopter}} {{main rotor}} or rotor {{system is the}} combination of several rotary wings (rotor blades) and a control system that generates the aerodynamic lift force that supports {{the weight of the}} helicopter, and the thrust that counteracts aerodynamic drag in forward flight. Each main rotor is mounted on a <b>vertical</b> <b>mast</b> {{over the top of the}} helicopter, as opposed to a helicopter tail rotor, which connects through a combination of drive shaft(s) and gearboxes along the tail boom. The blade pitch is typically controlled by a swashplate connected to the helicopter flight controls. Helicopters are one example of rotary-wing aircraft (rotorcraft). The name is derived from the Greek words helix, helik-, meaning spiral; and pteron meaning wing.|$|E

The hull appears pierced for at least 14 cannon with seven gunports evident along one side.|$|R
50|$|At VLF, LF and MF {{the radio}} mast or tower {{is often used}} {{directly}} as an antenna. Its height determines the <b>vertical</b> radiation pattern. <b>Masts</b> and towers with heights around a quarter wave or shorter, radiate considerable power towards the sky. This allows only a small area of fade-free reception at night, because the distance at which groundwave and skywave are of comparable strength and can interfere with each other is severely restricted (approximately 40 kilometres to 200 kilometres from the transmission site, depending on frequency and ground conductivity).|$|R
5000|$|As {{on other}} ships {{employing}} the Aegis system, the superstructure {{is dominated by}} the SPY-1's phased arrays, which eliminates the need for a traditional rotating antenna. The design of the superstructure also incorporates certain stealth features, designed to reduce radar cross section of the ship; however, as a consequence, the ship is considerably more top-heavy than a typical destroyer and requires a much deeper draft. As such, operations in a littoral (coastal) environment are limited. Overall, Kongō-class destroyers are much larger than traditional destroyers and at 9,485 tons displacement come close to cruisers in size. Because they are built to different operational requirements than the [...] ships, such as for carrying extra equipment for commanding a squadron, the Kongō-class ships' internal arrangement {{is quite different from the}} original design on which they are based. Recognisable external features are the <b>vertical</b> <b>mast</b> and the sleek sides of the bridge.|$|E
5000|$|The {{plan of the}} Hindola Mahal is a T-shape, though {{examination}} of the exterior walls leads {{to the conclusion that}} the crossbar was added later. The <b>vertical</b> <b>mast</b> of the plan consists of one main hall measuring 30 by 18 m and 12 m high. Its lateral walls are 3 m thick and further reinforced by massive inclined buttresses that angle over 77 degrees. These highly inclined buttresses give the Hindola Mahal (Swinging Palace) its name. They also neutralize the outward force of five massive ogee arches that once supported the large flat roof of the main hall. On each exterior of the long sides of the main hall are six recessed arches which hold doors in their lower sections and three slabs of open-work stone windows to let in air and light. [...] A high wall holds battlements on the roof of the building.|$|E
50|$|They {{are used}} as {{transmitting}} antennas below 1 MHz, in the LF and particularly the VLF bands, at frequencies sufficiently low that it is impractical to build a full size quarter-wave monopole antenna. Either the central mast itself, insulated from the ground, {{is connected to the}} transmitter and serves as the radiating element, or vertical wires parallel to the mast. At the low frequencies used the height of the mast is typically 1/10 to 1/40 of a wavelength, so it makes a very electrically short antenna, and by itself would have very low radiation resistance and be a very inefficient radiator. The function of the umbrella-wires is to add capacitance {{to the top of the}} antenna, improving the current distribution on the <b>vertical</b> <b>mast</b> radiator to increase the radiation resistance and radiated power. The umbrella wires serve as the plate of a capacitor, with the ground serving as the other plate, which is charged and discharged by the radio frequency current from the tramsmitter. Umbrella antennas with heights of 15 to 460 metres are in service. The tallest umbrella antennas are actually used by Lualualei VLF transmitter, INS Kattabomman and the CHAYKA-transmitters at Inta and Dudinka.|$|E
