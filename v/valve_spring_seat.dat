5000|$|It {{employed}} a hemispherical cylinder head, chain-driven single overhead camshaft (SOHC) and eight valves (two per cylinder). United States passenger car versions {{had a small}} secondary intake valve {{referred to as the}} [...] "Jet Valve". This valve induced swirl in the intake charge, enabling the use of leaner fuel/air mixtures for lower emissions. It was designed as a cartridge containing the <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> and <b>seat</b> which simply screwed into a threaded hole in the head, similar to a spark plug but inside the cam cover. The rocker arms for the intake valve were widened on the valve end to accommodate the cartridge, which was equipped with a very soft <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> in order to avoid wear on the camshaft intake lobe. Modifications to the head were thereby reduced as the Jet Valve negated the necessity for a three-valve-per-cylinder design.|$|R
40|$|In the {{automotive}} field {{during the last}} decade, owing primarily to increases in maximum engine speed and the almost universal use of overhead valve gear, increasing attention has been focused upon improper valve functioning which causes noisy operation, excessive <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> surge, <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> pounding, and exhaust valve b h g. With the conventional design of cams no allowance is made for {{the flexibility of the}} push rod and rocker, consequently in general the accelerations imparted to the valve are much greater than is necessary at high speeds when inertia effects build up. A general mathematical analysis of the conventional three-arc cam is presented, introducing the terms “eccentricity ” and “instantaneous radius”, and this is followed by a similar analysis of the new cam profile using the ‘same terms, together with the method of correcting the cam profile for high-speed operation. It is also shown how the new general equations can be used to deduce a variable eccentricity ramp, the purpose of which is to take up clearance at variable velocity. The effects of the new cam profile on horse-power and thermal efficiency are shown; the effect of the acceleration characteristic on <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> design also is illustrated, and a comparison shows the reduction in spring weight made possible by the elimination of <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> surge...|$|R

50|$|Poppet valves {{typically}} require small coil <b>springs,</b> appropriately named <b>valve</b> <b>springs,</b> to {{keep them}} closed when not actuated by the camshaft. They {{are attached to the}} valve stem ends, <b>seating</b> within <b>spring</b> retainers. Other mechanisms can be used in place of <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> to keep the valves closed: Formula 1 engines employ pneumatic <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> in which pneumatic pressure closes the valves, while motorcycle manufacturer Ducati uses desmodromic valve drive which mechanically close the valves.|$|R
50|$|The Mazda FE-DOHC uses a wide-angle, DOHC, {{belt-driven}} valvetrain configuration with flat-tappet 33 mm HLA bucket lifters. It is a interference design. There are two <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> per <b>valve</b> {{and four}} valves per cylinder. While a dual <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> configuration is used, the stock springs are fairly low-sprung. Low spring rates {{were chosen for}} increased valvetrain longevity and low friction with the dual <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> for the reduction of harmonics and increased valve stability.|$|R

50|$|Shot peening is {{a crucial}} process in spring making. Types of springs include leaf springs, {{extension}} springs, and compression springs. The most widely used application are for engine <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> (compression springs) due to high cyclic fatigue. In an OEM <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> application, the mechanical design combined with some shot peening ensures longevity. Automotive makers are shifting to more high performance higher stressed <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> designs as engines evolve. In aftermarket high performance <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> applications, the need for controlled and multi-step shot peening is a requirement to withstand extreme surface stresses that sometimes exceeds material specifications. The fatigue life of an extreme performance spring (NHRA, IHRA) can be as short as two passes on a 1/4 mile drag racing track before relaxation or failure occurs.|$|R

50|$|The common <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> {{system is}} {{satisfactory}} for traditional mass-produced engines {{that do not}} rev highly and are of a design that requires low maintenance. At the period of initial desmodromic development, <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> were a major limitation on engine performance because they would break from metal fatigue. Vacuum melt processes developed in the 1950s helped remove impurities in the steel used to make <b>valve</b> <b>springs,</b> although after sustained operation above 8000 RPM often springs would still fail. The desmodromic system was devised to remedy this problem. Furthermore, as maximum RPM increases, higher spring force is required to prevent valve float, leading to increased cam drag and higher wear on the parts at all speeds, problems addressed by the desmodromic mechanism.|$|R
