40|$|Stellar winds {{observed}} in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are usually {{attributed to a}} combination of stellar pulsations and radiation pressure on dust. Shock waves triggered by pulsations propagate through the atmosphere, compressing the gas and lifting it to cooler regions, which create favourable conditions for grain growth. If sufficient radiative acceleration is exerted on the newly formed grains through absorption or scattering of stellar photons, an outflow can be triggered. Strong candidates for wind-driving dust species in M-type AGB stars are magnesium silicates (Mg_ 2 SiO_ 4 and MgSiO_ 3). Such grains can form close to the stellar surface, they consist of abundant materials and, if they grow to sizes comparable to the wavelength of the stellar flux maximum, they experience strong acceleration by photon scattering. We use a frequency-dependent radiation-hydrodynamics code with a detailed description for the growth of Mg_ 2 SiO_ 4 grains to calculate the first extensive set of time-dependent wind models for M-type AGB stars. The resulting wind properties, <b>visual</b> and near-IR <b>photometry</b> and mid-IR spectra are compared with observations. We show that the models can produce outflows {{for a wide range of}} stellar parameters. We also demonstrate that they reproduce observed mass-loss rates and wind velocities, as well as <b>visual</b> and near-IR <b>photometry.</b> However, the current models do not show the characteristic silicate features at 10 and 18 μm as a result of the cool temperature of Mg_ 2 SiO_ 4 grains in the wind.

The spatial profile of MPOD (i. e. at 0. 5, 0. 25, 1, 1. 75 and 3 degrees of retinal eccentricity) was assessed by customized heterochromatic flicker <b>photometry.</b> <b>Visual</b> performance was assessed psychophysically including quantification of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), mesopic and photopic contrast sensitivity, glare sensitivity, photostress recovery time (PRT) and visual function by self-report. Results:Mean ± SD peak MPOD (at 0. 25 °) was 0. 48 ± 0. 19. There was a positive and statistically significant relationship between BCVA and MPOD across its full spatial profile (r = 0. 237 to 0. 308, p < 0. 01).

40|$|Purpose:The optical {{properties}} and anatomic distribution of macular pigment (MP) {{are such that}} it may theoretically contribute to visual performance by attenuating the effects of chromatic aberration and light scatter. The Collaborative Optical Macular Pigment Assessment (COMPASS) study is a placebo-controlled, randomized and double-blind clinical trial designed to assess whether MP optical density (MPOD) influences spatial vision by attenuating short wavelength light. Preliminary analysis of baseline findings, prior to supplementation, is presented here. Methods: 119 young (mean= 29 +/- 6 years) healthy subjects were recruited. The spatial profile of MPOD was assessed by customized heterochromatic flicker <b>photometry.</b> <b>Visual</b> performance was assessed by psychophysical tests including recognition acuity (VA), mesopic contrast sensitivity and photopic contrast sensitivity across spatial frequencies ranging from 1. 0 cycles per degree (cpd) to 20. 7 cpd. Subjects also completed a visual function questionnaire designed to generate a quantitative index of subjects perceived functional performance. Results:Mean peak MPOD was 0. 50 +/- 0. 19. Pearson’s correlation coefficient showed a statistically significant positive relationship between best corrected high contrast VA and MPOD at 0. 25, 0. 50, 1. 0, 1. 75, 3. 0 degrees of retinal eccentricity and with overall MPOD (r= 0. 202, p= 0. 029; r= 0. 211, p= 0. 022; r= 0. 190, p= 0. 039; r= 0. 320, p= 0. 000; r= 0. 233, p= 0. 011; r= 0. 243, p= 0. 008 respectively). Low contrast VA correlated with central MPOD at 0. 25 degrees but at no other retinal eccentricity (r= 0. 186, p= 0. 044). The questionnaire derived visual performance index revealed no significant correlation with baseline MPOD. Photopic contrast thresholds exhibited an inverse and statistically significant correlation with MPOD at 0. 25, 0. 50 and 1. 75 degrees of retinal eccentricity but only for the lowest spatial frequency of 1. 0 cpd (r=- 0. 239, p= 0. 009; r=- 0. 200, p= 0. 030; r=- 0. 230, p= 0. 012 respectively). Mesopic contrast thresholds showed no statistical correlation with baseline MPOD. Conclusions:Our results illustrate the difficulties inherent in assessment of MPOD and visual performance using cross sectional, observational methodology. Measures of central visual function including visual acuity and contrast sensitivity reveal variable associations with baseline MPOD. The outcome of this longitudinal, placebo-controlled and randomized supplementation trial will serve to more fully elucidate the potential for visual performance enhancement through MPOD augmentation...|$|R
