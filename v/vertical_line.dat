5|$|The Odyssey {{is capable}} of {{displaying}} three square dots and a <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> on the screen. Two of the dots are controlled by the two players, and the third by the system itself. The main console has two dials, one of which moves the <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> across the screen, and one which adjusts {{the speed of the}} computer-controlled dot. Different games direct the player to adjust the dials to different positions, for example to change the center line of a tennis game into the side wall of a handball game. The games include plastic overlays which stick to the television via static cling, to create visuals for the game. Different games that use the same game card can have different overlays, which can change a game with the same controls from, for example, a mountain ski path to a movement-based Simon Says game.|$|E
5|$|Marion J. Shelton, {{an early}} Mormon missionary, {{proposed}} {{the addition of}} a new glyph to represent the schwa, a simple <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> of the same height as other Deseret characters with a similar appearance to the Turkish dotless i (ı). The addition of this glyph did not catch on among his contemporaries, however, and no document outside of ones penned by Shelton makes use of it. Shelton used the new glyph in an 1860 letter to Brigham Young reporting on a recently completed mission to the Paiute people.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher's {{original}} helmet sported the colours of the German {{flag and}} his sponsor's decals. On {{the top was}} a blue circle with white astroids. When Jos Verstappen was his teammate, Schumacher added four red diagonal strokes over the visor to differentiate his helmet from his teammate. After Schumacher joined Ferrari a prancing horse was added on the back. From the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, in order to differentiate his colours from his new teammate Rubens Barrichello, Schumacher changed the upper blue colour {{and some of the}} white areas to red. Since 2004, the helmet sported a white diagonal line with a white <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> in the zone of the German Flag colours (originally to accommodate sponsor AMD), but then these lines remained in the Suzuka 2006 design.|$|E

5|$|The Dhyana Mantra of Raja-matangi {{from the}} Purashcharyarnava {{describes}} Matangi as green in colour with the crescent moon upon her forehead. She has long hair, a smiling expression and intoxicated eyes, and wears a garland of kadamba flowers and various ornaments. She perspires a little around the face, which renders {{her even more}} beautiful. Below her navel are three horizontal folds of skin and a thin <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> of fine hair. Seated on an altar and flanked by two parrots, she represents the 64 arts. The Saradatilaka, adds to this description that Raja-Matangi plays the veena, wears conch-shell earrings and flower garlands, and has flower paintings adorning her forehead.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> on {{the sight}} was {{relatively}} short, {{and could not}} be used directly to measure drift – unlike the long drift wires of the CSBS it replaced. To address this, the collimator handle could be used to manually rotate the sighting assembly forward, allowing the bomb aimer to point the sight further in front of the aircraft's location. This allowed the bomb aimer to select any convenient object on the ground for drift measurements, including the target itself, long before the aircraft reached it. Through periodic movements of the handle, the bomb aimer could ensure the drift line continued to pass through the target. When the handle was returned to the resting position and released, the shaft to the computor automatically re-engaged and started tracking the proper range angle again. The handle was also used to rotate the collimator forward for storage.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door {{to catch a glimpse}} of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> cutting off the body of Candaules at the top of his legs, invoking a theme of {{emasculation}} at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E

5000|$|According to the {{generalized}} Riemann Hypothesis the zeros of [...] are conjectured to lie inside the critical strip [...] {{lie on the}} <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> [...] and the poles of [...] inside the critical strip [...] lie on the <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> [...]|$|R
50|$|TVL {{is defined}} as the maximum number of {{alternating}} light and dark <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> that can be resolved per picture height. A resolution of 400 TVL means that 200 distinct dark <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> and 200 distinct white <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> can be counted over a horizontal span equal to the height of the picture. For example, on 4 x 3 in monitor with 400 TVL, 200 <b>vertical</b> dark <b>lines</b> can be counted over 3 in width on monitor (Note that the 3 in of monitor height is used rather than the 4 in of whole monitor width).|$|R
25|$|Definition: A {{point on}} the board where a {{horizontal}} line meets a <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> is called an intersection. Two intersections {{are said to be}} adjacent if they are distinct and connected by a horizontal or <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> with no other intersections between them.|$|E
25|$|In {{everyday}} handwriting, the ampersand {{is sometimes}} simplified in design {{as a large}} lowercase epsilon (Ɛ) or a backwards numeral 3 superimposed by a <b>vertical</b> <b>line.</b> The ampersand is also often shown as a backwards 3 with a <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> above and below it or a dot above and below it.|$|E

5000|$|For {{automatic}} focusing, {{the camera}} used a 5-point BASIS auto focus {{system with the}} sensors arranged horizontally across {{the middle of the}} viewing area. The center point is a cross-type, which detects horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>lines,</b> while the outer four detect <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> only.|$|R
50|$|Like {{all other}} {{foreshortened}} variants of perspective (one-point to six-point perspectives), it starts {{off with a}} horizon line, followed by four equally spaced vanishing points to delineate four <b>vertical</b> <b>lines.</b> The vanishing points made to create the curvilinear orthogonals are thus made ad hoc on the four <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> placed {{on the opposite side}} of the horizon line. The only dimension not foreshortened in this type of perspective is that of the rectilinear and parallel lines perpendicular to the horizon line - similar to the <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> used in two-point perspective.|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the density {{functions}} of nearest neighbor spacing distributions for zeros of the real or imaginary part of the Riemann xi-function on <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> are described by the M-function which is appeared in value distributions of the logarithmic derivative of the Riemann zeta-function on <b>vertical</b> <b>lines.</b> Comment: 15 page...|$|R

25|$|This is {{a special}} case of the {{standard}} form where A = 1 and B = 0. The graph is a <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> with x-intercept equal to a. The slope is undefined. There is no y-intercept, unless a = 0, {{in which case the}} graph of the line is the y-axis, and so every real number is a y-intercept. This is the only type of straight line which is not the graph of a function (it obviously fails the <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> test).|$|E
25|$|First, {{the reduced}} {{form of the}} metal to be {{oxidized}} at the anode (Zn) is written. This is separated from its oxidized form by a <b>vertical</b> <b>line,</b> which represents the limit between the phases (oxidation changes). The double vertical lines represent the saline bridge on the cell. Finally, the oxidized form of the metal to be reduced at the cathode, is written, separated from its reduced form by the <b>vertical</b> <b>line.</b> The electrolyte concentration is given as {{it is an important}} variable in determining the cell potential.|$|E
50|$|Conventional Bayer sensors {{can also}} produce false colour {{as they do}} not have R and B photosites in some {{horizontal}} and <b>vertical</b> <b>lines,</b> X-Trans sensors on the other hand have an improved colour reproduction due to all horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> containing at least one R, G and B pixels.|$|R
25|$|Most fundamentally, the {{behavior}} of light rays within the plane of reflection (affecting horizontal lines) is different from {{the behavior}} of light rays out of the plane of reflection (affecting <b>vertical</b> <b>lines).</b> Most conspicuously, identically sized horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> on the EUV mask are printed at different sizes on the wafer.|$|R

25|$|The ABS-CBN logo {{features}} {{three main}} elements, the <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> rooted on a horizontal origin, the three extending circles, {{and the text}} ABS-CBN. The <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> or bar represents a tower (broadcasting tower) as well as dignifying the company and representing its core business of broadcasting, with the circles symbolizing a transmitter tower's signals, and representing the red, green and blue or RGB colors which makes up a pixel shown on the television. The 3 divisions of the Philippines, Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, are also denoted by the three circles, {{as well as its}} wide presence, “range for imagination”, and its “pioneering, embracing” spirit.|$|E

50|$|Ancient inscribed and {{cuneiform}} scripts such as Anatolian hieroglyphs {{frequently used}} short <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> to separate words, as did Linear B. In manuscripts, <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> were {{more commonly used}} for larger breaks, equivalent to the Latin comma and period. This {{was the case for}} Biblical Hebrew (the paseq) and continues with many Indic scripts today.|$|R
