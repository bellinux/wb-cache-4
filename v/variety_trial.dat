40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the {{apparent}} discrepancy in yield potential between Roundup Ready soybean varieties and their conventional counterparts. Nearly all of this commentary is based on results of university run <b>variety</b> <b>trials.</b> <b>Variety</b> <b>trials</b> assess yield potential, among other variety performance characteristics, in experiments conducted under weed free conditions. Therefore, these trials do not replicate the experience that growers have in the field under true growing conditions, where competition with weeds, and variability in weed control, also affect yields. Based on <b>variety</b> <b>trials</b> conducted in 8 northern states, the average difference in yield potential between Roundup Ready soybean varieties and conventional varieties decreased from 4 % in 1998 to 3 % in 1999. It is expected that this difference will be even smaller when the results of trials conducted this past summer are analyzed. An analysis of the 1999 trials in comparison to an earlier analysis of 1998 trials is presented.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of series of crop <b>variety</b> <b>trials</b> {{has a long}} history with the earliest approaches being based on ANOVA methods. Kempton (1984) discussed the inadequacies of this approach, summarized the alternatives available at that time and noted that all of these approaches could be classified as multiplicative models. Recently, mixed model approaches have become popular for the {{analysis of}} series of <b>variety</b> <b>trials.</b> There are numerous reasons for their use, including the ease with which incomplete data (not all <b>varieties</b> in all <b>trials)</b> can be handled and the ability to appropriately model within-trial error variation. Currently, the most common mixed model approaches for series of <b>variety</b> <b>trials</b> are mixed model versions of the methods summarized by Kempton (1984).

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the South African Sugar Association Experiment Station (SASEX) Agronomy <b>variety</b> <b>trials</b> is to compare relative yields amongst sugarcane varieties for making variety recommendations for different agroclimatic zones.

The Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) and the Additive Main effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) methods were used to analyse data with GxE interaction in order to: 1) Predict mean estimated recoverable crystal (ERC) yields across different environments. 2) Evaluate the usefulness of AMMI and REML in identifying mega-environments...|$|R

40|$|Sugarcane {{breeding}} {{is expensive}} because {{the plant is}} perennial and the frequency in obtaining superior clones is low. Plant breeding involves developing strategies that will increase the probability of identifying superior varieties. This paper discusses the strategies used to select varieties with high sugar yield, good disease and pest tolerance and adaptable to the South-East Lowveld of Zimbabwe. Potential strategies for the future are described. In the Single Stools and Single Lines stages (unreplicated), the strategy is to discard all genotypes with undesirable traits. In the <b>Variety</b> Observation <b>Trials,</b> Advanced <b>Variety</b> <b>Trials</b> and Pre-release <b>Variety</b> <b>Trials</b> (replicated stages) the strategy is to select those varieties that show an advantage over the control cultivars (N 14 and NCo 376) in yield, cane quality, pest and disease tolerance and ratooning ability.
