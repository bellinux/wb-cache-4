25|$|Older British plates had white, grey {{or silver}} {{characters}} {{on a black}} background. This style of plate was phased out in 1972 and, until 2012, legal to be carried only on vehicles first registered before 1 January 1973. A vehicle which was first registered on or after 1 January 1973 shall be treated {{as if it was}} first registered before that date if it was constructed before 1 January 1973. However, the Finance Bill 2014 and subsequent Finance Acts extended the Historic <b>Vehicle</b> <b>class</b> cut-off year from 1973 to 1974 and subsequently, a rolling forty years. This had the effect of linking eligibility to display old-style plates with 'Tax Exempt' vehicle status. It follows that the older style plates are now available for any vehicle constructed 40 or more years ago, provided that an application has been made to the DVLA to have the vehicle included in the historic vehicle class; it is so registered and is nil-rated for Vehicle Excise Duty.|$|E

2500|$|While SUVs {{are often}} {{perceived}} as having inferior rearward vision compared with regular passenger cars, {{this is not}} supported by controlled testing which found poor rearward visibility {{was not limited to}} any single <b>vehicle</b> <b>class.</b> Australia's NRMA motoring organisation found that regular passenger cars commonly provided inferior rearward vision compared to SUVs, both because of the prevalence of reversing cameras on modern SUVs and the shape of many popular passenger cars, with their high rear window lines and boots (trunks) obstructing rearward vision. In NRMA testing, two out of 42 SUVs (5%) and 29 out of 163 (18%) regular cars had the worst rating (>15-metre blind spot). Of the vehicles that received a perfect 0-metre blind spot rating, 11 out of 42 (26%) were SUVs and eight out of 163 (5%) were regular passenger cars.

2500|$|Typically, the {{registration}} number is embossed – or, more rarely, impressed – onto the license plate. Other identifying information, such as {{the name of the}} issuing jurisdiction and the <b>vehicle</b> <b>class,</b> can be either surface-printed or embossed; Virginia, for example, does the former for passenger cars and the latter for most non-passenger vehicles. [...] However, it is increasingly common in the U.S. for {{the registration}} number to be surface-printed using digital printing technology. [...] Colorado, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oregon, and Washington do so only for certain types of license plates, such as vanity plates and special issues; Alabama, Arizona, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wyoming, and the District of Columbia have switched to the so-called [...] "flat plate" [...] technology for all their license plates. Nevada formerly issued flat plates but has returned to making embossed plates. Delaware license plates have not been embossed for several decades.

40|$|Demands of freight and {{passenger}} traffic are often considered to be in competition, particularly on designated urban freight routes that use major arterial signalised traffic corridors. A microsimulation model of an urban traffic corridor in Brisbane was developed in order for corridor performance to be evaluated for alternative priority treatments. The model was calibrated with GPS travel time and trajectory data {{for a range of}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes</b> typical of those found on Australian urban freight routes. Intersection status was recorded simultaneously by the STREAMS traffic management system, enabling the progression of different <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes</b> to be validated under existing signal timing plans. The model {{can be applied to the}} optimisation of corridor signal timings. Unlike other models, it was possible to define vehicle-specific performance measures, such as delay, number of stops, and a combination of these. The model can be used to find the best combination of signal timings to favour the progression of particular <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes,</b> such as large freight vehicles. The effects on other <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes</b> can be noted; finding that, although being suboptimal for other classes, it may be possible to achieve some overall gains in traffic efficiency...|$|R
