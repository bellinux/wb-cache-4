5|$|A {{wide array}} of {{bacterial}} and viral diseases affect sheep. Diseases of the hoof, such as foot rot and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies. These painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding. Ovine Johne's disease is a wasting disease that affects young sheep. Bluetongue disease is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the mucous membranes. Ovine rinderpest (or peste des petits ruminants) is a highly contagious and often fatal <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> affecting sheep and goats.|$|E
5|$|As Binky {{approached}} sexual maturity, zoo officials negotiated for {{the purchase}} of a female polar bear named Mimi from the Tulsa Zoo in Oklahoma. As the transfer was being finalized, however, Mimi died from a <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> in Tulsa. In February 1979, young polar bear twins (Nuka, a female, and Siku, a male) joined Binky in his enclosure. Binky got along poorly with Siku, however, so Siku was given to a zoo in Morelia, Mexico in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Shingles, {{also known}} as herpes zoster, is a <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> {{characterized}} by a painful skin rash with blisters in a localized area. Typically the rash occurs in a single, wide stripe either on {{the left or right}} of the body or face. Two to four days before the rash occurs there may be tingling or local pain in the area.|$|E

5|$|Rates of dengue {{increased}} 30fold between 1960 and 2010. This {{increase is}} believed to be due to a combination of urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and global warming. The geographical distribution is around the equator. Of the 2.5billion people living in areas where it is common 70% are from Asia and the Pacific. An infection with dengue is second only to malaria as a diagnosed cause of fever among travelers returning from the developing world. It is the most common <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> transmitted by arthropods, and has a disease burden estimated at 1,600 disability-adjusted life years per million population. The World Health Organization counts dengue as one of seventeen neglected tropical diseases.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{also contains}} a sugar-binding protein, or lectin, that has affinity for the sugars xylose and melibiose. The lectin is mitogenic—that is, it can stimulate cells {{to begin the process}} of cell division, resulting in mitosis. Further, the lectin has antiviral properties: it inhibits the human immunodeficiency virus enzyme reverse transcriptase. Other studies suggest that B.edulis also has antiviral activity against Vaccinia virus and tobacco mosaic virus grown in culture. Antiviral compounds from mushrooms are a subject of interest in biomedical research for their potential to advance the knowledge of viral replication, and as new drugs in the treatment of <b>viral</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
5|$|Herpes simplex is a <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> {{caused by}} the herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of}} the body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E

25|$|Yellow fever is a <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> of {{typically}} short duration. In most cases, {{symptoms include}} fever, chills, loss of appetite, nausea, muscle pains {{particularly in the}} back, and headaches. Symptoms typically improve within five days. In about 15% of people within a day of improving, the fever comes back, abdominal pain occurs, and liver damage begins causing yellow skin. If this occurs, the risk of bleeding and kidney problems is also increased.|$|E
25|$|Each {{patient with}} the {{susceptible}} genotype accumulates iron {{at different rates}} depending on iron intake, {{the exact nature of}} the mutation, and the presence of other insults to the liver such as alcohol and <b>viral</b> <b>disease.</b> As such {{the degree to which the}} liver and other organs is affected is highly variable and is dependent on these factors and co-morbidities as well as age at which they are studied for manifestations of disease.

25|$|Rinderpest (also cattle plague or steppe murrain) was an {{infectious}} <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> of cattle, domestic buffalo, {{and some other}} species of even-toed ungulates, including buffaloes, large antelope and deer, giraffes, wildebeests, and warthogs. The disease was characterized by fever, oral erosions, diarrhea, lymphoid necrosis, and high mortality. Death rates during outbreaks were usually extremely high, approaching 100% in immunologically naïve populations. Rinderpest was mainly transmitted by direct contact and by drinking contaminated water, although {{it could also be}} transmitted by air. After a global eradication campaign, the last confirmed case of rinderpest was diagnosed in 2001.|$|E

The results indicated that <b>viral</b> <b>diseases</b> are not a major constraint to groundnut production. Peanut clump furovirus was observed in 1 field at incidences ranging from 4 to 10 % and 5 to 15 % incidence of peanut bud necrosis tospovirus was observed in another field. Viral symptoms were observed in other fields but often symptoms were unclear...|$|R
25|$|Mumps is a <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> {{caused by}} the mumps virus. Initial signs and {{symptoms}} often include fever, muscle pain, headache, and feeling tired. This is then usually followed by painful swelling of one or both parotid salivary glands. Symptoms typically occur 16 to 18 days after exposure and resolve after seven to ten days. Symptoms in adults are often more severe than in children. About a third of people have mild or no symptoms. Complications may include meningitis (15 percent), pancreatitis (four percent), permanent deafness, and testicular inflammation which uncommonly results in infertility. Women may develop ovarian swelling {{but this does not}} increase the risk of infertility.|$|E
25|$|Mothers express {{milk for}} {{multiple}} reasons. Expressing breast milk can maintain a mother's milk supply {{when she and}} her child are apart. A sick baby who is unable to nurse can take expressed milk through a nasogastric tube. Some babies are unable or unwilling to nurse. Expressed milk is the feeding method of choice for premature babies. <b>Viral</b> <b>disease</b> transmission can be prevented by expressing breast milk and subjecting it to Holder pasteurisation. Some women donate expressed breast milk (EBM) to others, either directly or through a milk bank. This allows mothers who cannot breastfeed to give their baby the benefits of breast milk.|$|E
25|$|Canine {{distemper}} (sometimes termed hardpad disease) is a <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> {{that affects}} {{a wide variety}} of animal families, including domestic and wild species of dogs, coyotes, foxes, pandas, wolves, ferrets, skunks, raccoons, and large cats, as well as pinnipeds, some primates, {{and a variety of other}} species. It was long believed that animals in the family Felidae, including many species of large cat as well as domestic cats, were resistant to canine distemper, until some researchers reported the prevalence of CDV infection in large felids. It is now known that both large Felidae and domestic cats can be infected, usually through close housing with dogs or possibly blood transfusion from infected cats, but such infections appear to be self-limiting and largely without symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Epizootics are {{outbreaks}} (epidemics) {{of disease}} among non-human animals. During the 20th century significant epizootics of <b>viral</b> <b>diseases</b> in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide. The many diseases caused by viruses included foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest of cattle, avian and swine influenza, swine fever and bluetongue of sheep. <b>Viral</b> <b>diseases</b> of livestock {{can be devastating}} both to farmers and the wider community, as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001 showed.|$|R
50|$|In the Iberian peninsula, the European {{wild rabbit}} {{population}} {{has experienced a}} sharp decline from <b>viral</b> <b>diseases</b> and overhunting. To protect the species from <b>viral</b> <b>diseases,</b> the myxoma virus was genetically modified to immunize the rabbits. The European wild rabbit population in Australia faces the opposite problem: lack of natural predators has made the introduced species invasive. The same myxoma virus was genetically modified to lower fertility in the Australian rabbit population.|$|R
