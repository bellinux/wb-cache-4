40|$|Supported by the CGIAR System-wide Livestock ProgrammeCereal crop {{residues}} are important feed resources for ruminants in developing countries. However, they are poor <b>in</b> nutritive <b>value</b> because digestible energy, crude protein and mineral contents are all low. Techniques {{to improve the}} feeding value of {{crop residues}} by chemical or biological means have not been adopted widely by small farmers in developing countries. Genetic enhancement may provide an alternative and practical strategy for improvement of nutritive <b>value</b> <b>in</b> cereal <b>straws</b> and stovers.

40|$|Straws and stovers {{are often}} called `by-products` of grain {{production}} {{even though they}} are increasingly important, e. g. for animal feed, thatching, soil improvement, mushroom production and industrial use. As a result, plant breeders, agronomists, economists and animal nutritionists have to pay more attention than before to the total value of crops, i. e. whole plant <b>value</b> <b>in</b> which <b>straws</b> and grain both play a part. This paper reviews literature about the technical potential of breeding and/or management for more or better straw. It then discusses issues of the economic value (EV) and nutritional value (NV) of straw and stovers for livestock feed to guide research and development in cereal breeding and management. It is mainly based on experiences from the Indian subcontinent and semi-arid regions of the Near and Middle East. The paper shows that {{the quantity and quality of}} straw produced has changed considerably over recent decades as a result of breeding policies, new cultivation patterns and choice of cultivars. Both EV and NV depend on type of grain, animal production system and access to other feeds. A classification of these factors is provided and suggests that the EV of straw is particularly important in low-input systems with stovers from coarse grains...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on general {{properties}} of straw bale as a building material which has been proven by buildings throughout {{the world to be}} an appropriate material choice. Still, there are many hesitations about using this alternative building material. The building techniques are relatively easy to learn and the performance of straw bale structures has a high <b>value</b> <b>in</b> terms of several aspects as long as general requirements are followed. The primary benefit of straw bale as a building material is its low embodied energy. It also has high thermal and sound insulation properties. Many previous research studies on straw bale building have been focused on structural stability, fire resistance and assessing moisture content <b>in</b> <b>straw</b> bales {{which is one of the}} major issues. Therefore, special attention needs to be devoted to details to insure proper building safety. Render selection is especially crucial and an extremely important step <b>in</b> <b>straw</b> bale building, not only in matters concerning moisture but also structural capacity and fire protection. A major disadvantage of straw bale construction is its lack of material research. The paper is divided into three parts in which advantages and disadvantages of such a building are discussed. In the third part, results are presented for a survey in which correspondents emphasized the advantages and disadvantages of living <b>in</b> a <b>straw</b> bale building...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This study assesses {{enantioselectivity}} on {{the degradation}} of tebuconazole <b>in</b> wheat grain, <b>straw,</b> and soil <b>in</b> Beijing and Zhejiang under open field conditions. After agricultural application, the analytes were extracted from soil and grain with acetonitrile, and from straw with acetonitrile containing 1 % acetic acid through ultrasonic extraction. The extracts were cleaned by dispersive-solid phase extraction, and determined by chiral liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with a Lux amylose- 2 column. The results of field trials indicated that {{the degradation of}} tebuconazole enantiomers followed first-order kinetics <b>in</b> <b>straw</b> and soil at the two sites. Their half-lives <b>in</b> <b>straw</b> ranged from 3. 88 to 4. 93 days, which were shorter than those in soil ranging from 40. 76 to 43. 86 days. The (-) -tebuconazole showed faster degradation <b>in</b> <b>straw</b> from Beijing and Zhejiang. In Zhejiang soil, preferential degradation of (+) -tebuconazole was observed, whereas (-) -tebuconazole was preferential in Beijing soil. The terminal residues of (-) -tebuconazole in most grains were higher than those of its antipode, indicating significant enantioselective residues...|$|R

40|$|Rice (Oryza sativa L.) accumulates {{large amounts}} of silicon which {{improves}} its growth and health due to enhanced resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Silicon uptake and loading to xylem in rice are predominantly active processes performed by transporters encoded by the recently identified genes Lsi 1 (Si influx transporter gene) and Lsi 2 (Si efflux transporter gene). Silicon deposition in rice during translocation to upper plant tissues is known to discriminate against the heavier isotopes (29) Si and (30) Si, resulting in isotope fractionation within the plant. We analyzed straw and husk samples of rice mutants defective in Lsi 1, Lsi 2 or both for silicon content and delta(29) Si using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and compared these results with those for the corresponding wild-type varieties (WT). The silicon content was higher in husk than <b>in</b> <b>straw.</b> All the mutant rice lines showed clearly lower silicon content than the WT lines (4 - 23 % Si of WT). The delta(29) Si was lower <b>in</b> <b>straw</b> and husk for the uptake defective mutant (lsi 1) than for WT, albeit delta(29) Si was 0. 3 per thousand higher in husk than <b>in</b> <b>straw</b> <b>in</b> both lines. The effect of defective efflux (lsi 2) differed for straw and husk with higher delta(29) Si <b>in</b> <b>straw,</b> but lower delta(29) Si in husk while WT showed similar delta(29) Si in both fractions. These initial results show the potential of Si isotopes to enlighten the influence of active uptake on translocation and deposition processes in the plant...|$|R

40|$|To give {{an insight}} into the {{kinetics}} of microbial oil fermentation with lignocellulosic hydrolysate as substrate, lipid production by Trichosporon fermentans <b>in</b> rice <b>straw</b> hydrolysate was investigated in a 5 L fermentor. For comparison, fermentation in its simulated medium was also performed to evaluate the effect of inhibitors present <b>in</b> the rice <b>straw</b> hydrolysate on the cell growth and lipid accumulation of T. fermentans. The optimum fermentation time, maximum biomass, and lipid content of T. fermentans <b>in</b> the rice <b>straw</b> hydrolysate were 10. 5 days, 28. 6 g/L, and 43. 9 %, respectively, while the corresponding <b>values</b> <b>in</b> the simulated medium were 8. 5 days, 27. 0 g/L, and 65. 0 %, respectively, indicating that the inhibitors <b>in</b> the rice <b>straw</b> hydrolysate did show some inhibition on the cell growth and lipid accumulation of T. fermentans. Kinetic models of lipid fermentation with T. fermentans showed the maximum specific growth rate and the correlation coefficient of lipid synthesis to cell growth <b>in</b> the rice <b>straw</b> hydrolysate were 0. 40 and 0. 51, respectively, which are much lower {{than those in the}} simulated medium (0. 58 and 0. 73). To better understand the influential mechanism of inhibitors <b>in</b> the rice <b>straw</b> hydrolysate on the growth and lipid accumulation of T. fermentans, the physiological and biochemical changes of cells in the fermentation were further investigated. The reduced activities of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) citrate lyase, malic enzyme, and xylose reductase, and the elongation of cells at the beginning of fermentation, partly account for the inhibitory effect of inhibitors <b>in</b> the rice <b>straw</b> hydrolysate...|$|R
