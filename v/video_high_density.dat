50|$|JVC {{produced}} a system {{very similar to}} CED called <b>Video</b> <b>High</b> <b>Density</b> (VHD). It was launched in 1983 and marketed predominantly in Japan. It was a capacitance contact system but without grooves. VHD discs were adopted in the UK by Thorn EMI which started to develop a consumer catalogue, including bespoke material. Development for the mass market was halted in late 1983 but the system remained on sale for educational and business markets as a computer-controlled video system until the late 1980s, with very little success.|$|E

In most experiments, 5, 5 ′-dithionitrobenzoic acid, an inhibitor of the enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, was added during {{the collection of}} lymph to prevent modification of the lipid composition of newly secreted lipoproteins. Negative staining electron microscopy of lymph <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein revealed discoidal particles (190 ± 3 × 55 ± 1 Å) which tended to form rouleaux, smaller spherical particles were also present. Serum <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein contained only spherical particles (diameter 93 ± 4 Å). Lipid analysis showed that lymph <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein was enriched in phospholipid and deficient in cholesterol esters when compared to serum <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein. The phospholipid to cholesterol esters ratio was greatest in basal lymph <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein when compared to fatty lymph and serum <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein. From analysis of the lipid compositional data and direct particle measurement by electron microscopy, it could be determined that ≅ 50 % of basal lymph <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein and 30 % of fatty lymph <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein was discoid. Basal lymph <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein was enriched in apoA-I and deficient in the arginine-rich peptide, and the apoprotein composition of fatty lymph <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein more closely resembled serum. These observations demonstrate that intestinal lymph contains two types of <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein particles, a discoid nascent particle deficient in cholesterol ester and rich in apoA-I, and spherical <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein derived from plasma.

50|$|Manufacturers also {{introduced}} other {{systems such as}} needle-based, record-style discs (RCA's Capacitance Electronic Disc, JVC's <b>Video</b> <b>High</b> <b>Density</b> disc) and Philips' LaserDisc. None of these disc formats gained much ground as none was capable of home recording; however, they did hold small niche markets. CED's inexpensive record-like format (using a fine keel-shaped stylus to read an electronic signal rather than mechanical vibrations) made it attractive to low-income families during the 1980s, and LaserDisc's 5 megahertz/420 line resolution made it popular with discerning videophiles until circa 1997 (when DVD-Video became the new standard for high-quality).|$|E
50|$|In 1979, JVC {{demonstrated}} {{a prototype of}} its <b>video</b> <b>high</b> <b>density</b> (VHD) disc system. This system was capacitance-based, like capacitance electronic disc (CED), but the discs were grooveless with the stylus being guided by servo signals in the disc surface. The VHD discs were initially handled by the operator and played on a machine that looked like an audio LP turntable, but JVC used caddy-housed discs when the system was marketed. Development suffered numerous delays, and the product was launched in 1983 in Japan, followed by the United Kingdom in 1984, to a limited industrial market.|$|E

40|$|Rat livers were perfused for 6 h without added plasma {{proteins}} using washed erythrocytes and buffer in a recirculating system. An inhibitor to {{the enzyme}} lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (5, 5 '-dithionitrobenzoic acid) was added in some experiments to prevent modification of substrate-lipids contained in secreted lipoproteins. The inhibitor did not detectably alter hepatic ultrastructure or gas exchange, but it inhibited the secreted lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase {{by more than}} 85 %. Very low density lipoproteins in perfusate were unaltered but the <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins obtained from livers perfused with the inhibitor appeared disk-shaped in negative stain by electron microscopy with a mean edge thickness of 46 +/- 5 A and a mean diameter of 190 +/- 25 A. The <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins were composed predominantly of polar lipids and protein with only small amounts of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. The major apoprotein of these discoidal fractions had the same electrophoretic mobility as the arginine-rich apoprotein, whereas plasma <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins contained mainly the A-I approtein. In all these respects the discoidal perfusate <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins closely resemble those found in human plasma which is deficient in lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase. Perfusate <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins obtained {{in the absence of}} the enzyme inhibitor more closely resembled plasma <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins in chemical composition (content of cholesteryl esters and apoproteins) and in electron microscopic appearance. Purified lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase synthesized cholesteryl esters at a substantially faster rate from substrate lipids of perfusate <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins than those from plasma. The discoidal <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins were the best substrate for this reaction. Thin sections of plasma <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins indicated a spherical particle whereas discoidal <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins stained with the characteristic trilaminar image of membranes.

40|$|Australian {{cities are}} facing a number of challenges, {{including}} a significant growth in population, a growing housing affordability crisis, a greater concern for environmental issues (such as climate change), and shortfalls in transport and other urban infrastructure. In response to these challenges the promotion of a <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> built form has come to represent an urban planning orthodoxy promoted via metropolitan strategies across the country. Despite {{the dominance of the}} <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> ideal within policy rhetoric, its virtues remain the subject of significant debate. To date this debate has been played out in academic and policy circles, with limited recognition of the knowledge and perceptions of such policies held by the general public. Debate around public perceptions of <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> housing has been constrained within the not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) discourse which works to position public opposition to <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> housing as either an illegitimate and selfish form of localised protest or a valid example of urban citizenship and democracy.

40|$|The daily {{transport}} of human plasma apolipoproteins A-I and A-II, triglyceride, and total cholesterol from the thoracic duct lymph into plasma {{was measured in}} 2 subjects before and 3 subjects after renal transplantation. Lymph triglyceride transport was ~ 83 % of the daily ingested fat loads, whereas lymph cholesterol transport was consistently greater than the amount of daily ingested cholesterol. Lymph apolipoprotein transport significantly (P < 0. 05) exceeded the predicted apolipoprotein synthesis rate {{by an average of}} 659 ± 578 mg/d for apolipoprotein A-I and 109 ± 59 mg/d for apolipoprotein A-II among the 5 subjects. It is estimated that 22 - 77 % (apolipoprotein A-I) and 28 - 82 % (apolipoprotein A-II) of daily total body apolipoprotein synthesis takes place in the intestine. Lymph <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein particles are mostly <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein(2 b) and <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein(2 a) and have a greater overall relative triglyceride content and a smaller relative cholesteryl ester content when compared with homologous plasma <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins.

40|$|Master of Regional and Community PlanningDepartment of Landscape Architecture/Regional and Community PlanningJason BrodyToday, {{achieving}} <b>higher</b> residential <b>densities</b> is {{an integral}} part of most discussions on concepts such as sustainability, placemaking, smart growth and new urbanism. It is argued that <b>high</b> <b>density</b> environments can potentially improve quality of life through a range of social benefits. In attempting to achieve these benefits, often times, developments that provide more than a certain number of dwelling units are considered desirable and successful high-density developments. However, understanding <b>high</b> residential <b>density</b> merely in terms of an increase in the number of dwelling units over an area of development might not help realize meaningful social benefits; in fact it could result in problems such as parking constraints, increased vehicular traffic, crowding, and eventually abandonment. This implies a dilemma of understanding <b>high</b> <b>density</b> environments holistically. Using literature review and design exploration as two key research methods, this project aims at resolving this dilemma by presenting a holistic understanding of desirable high-density environments. The research works on the idea that <b>high</b> <b>densities</b> are a matter of design and performance. Through synthesis of literature review and explorative design findings, this research focuses on the qualitative aspects of <b>high</b> <b>density</b> environments that make them meaningful and desirable. Through synthesis of literature review and design findings, the research finds that desirable <b>high</b> <b>density</b> environments should (a) Be Physically Compact; (b) Support Urbanity; and (c) Offer Livability and Sense of Place. These three qualitative aspects of <b>high</b> <b>density</b> environments are critical in determining how well such environments perform. The research further proposes eight meaningful goals and seventeen specific guidelines to achieve aforementioned three qualities that influence the performance of <b>high</b> <b>density</b> developments. In addition to these principles and guidelines, opportunities and challenges posed by explorative design exercises also allows identifying certain supplementary guidelines necessary to strengthen the framework. Together, these findings result in a theoretical framework that may be used as an effective design and evaluation tool in considering <b>high</b> <b>density</b> environments. This framework is named “Density Dynamics” to signify various morphological and socio-economic dynamics involved in a holistic understanding of <b>high</b> <b>density</b> environments...|$|R
