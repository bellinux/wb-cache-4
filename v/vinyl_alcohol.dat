40|$|Ruthenium-catalyzed olefin {{metathesis}} is {{an exceptionally}} powerful method for the catalytic formation of new C=C bonds, recognized {{last year with}} the Nobel Prize. While the Grubbs-class catalysts RuCl 2 LL'(CHPh) have led to many advances, they offer limited selectivity and lifetimes. As these shortcomings are associated with the chloride ligands, we sought to incorporate "pseudohalide" ligands. Catalysts RuXX'(CHPh) (IMes) (py) were prepared by use of sterically undemanding ancillary ligands and electron-deficient aryloxides. Their modular structure permits control over selectivity via matching of catalyst and substrate reactivity. While their initiation efficiency lies between that of the second- and third-generation Grubbs catalysts, high efficiency is found in RCM of alpha,o-dienes to form trisubstituted olefins, <b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohols,</b> alpha,beta-unsaturated acrylates, macrolactones, ethers, tertiary amines, thioethers, and silanes. Their performance relative to the most active Grubbs systems is sometimes better, sometimes less so, with the optimum catalyst being a matter of trial and error (though the sustained activity of the aryloxide catalysts means that they often perform better in reactions that require long lifetimes). They are outstanding in enyne metathesis (enabling quantitative formation of tetrasubstituted olefins, a first in Ru-catalyzed metathesis) and in RCM synthesis of macrocycles. Examination of the much longer reaction time of the Grubbs systems led to the unexpected finding that oligomerization of alpha,o-dienes is kinetically dominant, and that RCM products are liberated in a concentration-dependent backbiting reaction. This is extremely important, as oligomers are generally regarded as a dead end in metathesis.

Based on previous studies in the laboratory of professor Ohyun Kwon, the densely functionalized six-membered ring of the natural product was constructed utilizing an intermolecular Diels-Alder cycloaddition between maleic anhydride and a highly substituted alkoxydiene. The requisite diene was synthesized via a Stille cross coupling reaction for which an efficient {{synthesis of}} the necessary vinyl stannane was developed. An alternative {{synthesis of the}} diene based on copper mediated coupling of <b>vinyl</b> boronates with <b>alcohols</b> was also devised, which allowed for the preparation of gram quantities with minimal purification. The five-membered ring of guanacastepene A was appended through coupling with a highly functionalized zinc cuprate. While previous studies in the Kwon laboratory showed that a conjugate addition/Mukaiyama aldol strategy to install the C 11 methyl group and forge the seven-membered ring was efficient in forming the two desired carbon-carbon bonds, poor diastereoselectivity of the initial conjugate addition was observed. The research described here uses the Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi reaction to close the central seven-membered ring without prior installation of the C 11 methyl group. Chapter 2 	The synthesis of 3 -carbethoxy- 2 -substituted- 3 -pyrrolines via the phosphine-catalyzed intramolecular &# 947;-umpolung addition of N-tosyl &# 945;-aminoalkylallenic esters is described. The current transformation provides a compliment to the known syntheses of similarly substituted pyrrolines via the phosphine-catalyzed [3 + 2] annulation between imines and allenoates. The flexibility in substitution at the 2 -position, including alkyl groups, offers benefits over many of the previously reported syntheses of similarly substituted pyrrolines. The N-tosyl &# 945;-aminoalkylallenic esters were prepared via a novel decarboxylative rearrangement of allenylic carbamates. Chapter 3 	The enantioselective total synthesis of the monoterpene indole alkaloid (+) -ibophyllidine is described.

This key transformation constructed the stereochemically dense D-ring with exceptional levels of diastereo- and enantioselectivity. A subsequent diastereoselective hydrogenation of the pyrroline double bond led to the fully functionalized, all syn pyrrolidine ring of the natural product.

This {{is achieved by}} examining the effect of inhibitor design, especially warheads, on IC₅₀ values and structureactivity relationships between cysteine protease inhibitors of the papain superfamily. The representative proteases used are m-calpain, μ-calpain, cathepsin B and papain. Chapter One is an introductory chapter; Chapters Two-Four describe the design and synthesis of cysteine protease inhibitors; Chapter Five discusses assay protocol; and Chapter Six contains the assay results and structure-activity relationships of the synthesised inhibitors. Chapter One introduces cysteine proteases of the papain family and examines the structure, physiology and role in disease of papain, cathepsin B, m-calpain and μ-calpain. The close structural homology that exists between these members of the papain superfamily is identified, as well characteristics unique to each protease. Covalent reversible, covalent irreversible and non-covalent warheads are defined. The generic inhibitor scaffold of address region, recognition and warhead, upon which the inhibitors synthesised in this thesis are based, is also introduced.

A discussion is given on the benefits of constraining inhibitors into the extended bioactive conformation known as a β-strand. Ring closing metathesis is utilised in the synthesis of the macrocyclic aldehyde 4. 4, macrocyclic semicarbazone 4. 15, the macrocyclic cyanohydrin 4. 16, the macrocyclic α-ketotetrazole 4. 18 and the macrocyclic azide 4. 19. Chapter Five introduces enzyme inhibition studies. The BODIPY-casein fluorogenic assay used for establishing inhibitor potency against m-calpain and μ-calpain is validated. Assay protocols are also established and validated for cathepsin B, papain, pepsin and α- chymotrypsin. A discussion of the effect of solvent on enzyme activity is also included as part of this study. Chapter Six presents the assay results for all the inhibitors synthesised throughout this thesis and an extensive structure-activity relationship study between inhibitors is included. The alcohols 2. 26 and 2. 30 are unprecedented examples of non-covalent, potent, cathepsin B inhibitors (IC₅₀ = 0. 075 μM selectivity 80 -fold and 1. 1 μM, selectivity 18 -fold). The macrocyclic semicarbazone 4. 15 is an unprecedented example of a potent macrocyclic cysteine protease inhibitor (m-calpain: IC₅₀ = 0. 16 μM, selectivity 8 -fold). The cyanohydrin 2. 51 contains an unprecedented cysteine protease warhead and is a potent and selective inhibitor of papain (IC₅₀ = 0. 030 μM, selectivity 3 -fold). The O-protected cyanohydrin 2. 61 is a potent and selective inhibitor of pepsin (IC₅₀ = 1. 6 μM, selectivity 1. 5 -fold). The top ten warheads for potent, selective cathepsin B inhibition are: carboxylic acid, methyl ester, diazoketone, esterified cyanohydrin, α-bromomethyl ketone, α,β- unsaturated aldehyde, <b>vinyl</b> sulfones, α-bromomethyl-C₃-S,R-alcohol, <b>alcohol</b> and α,β- unsaturated ethyl ester. The selectivity of these warheads was between 5 - and 130 -fold for cathepsin B. The best inhibitors for cathepsin B were the α-bromomethyl ketone 3. 26 (IC₅₀ = 0. 075 μM, selectivity 16 -fold), the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde 3. 18 (IC₅₀ = 0. 13 μM, selectivity 13 -fold) and the esterified cyanohydrin 3. 59 (IC₅₀ = 0. 35 μM, selectivity 22 - fold). Chapter Seven outlines the experimental details and synthesis of the compounds prepared in this thesis...|$|R
