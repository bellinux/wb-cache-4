50|$|In 1959, {{the first}} Landini crawler tractor, the C35 was manufactured, {{and the company}} was {{purchased}} 100% by Massey Ferguson. In 1973 Landini launched the 500 Series of 2 and 4 wheeled tractors. 1980 saw the company diversifying its products as well as specializing. Also in 1980 Landini started work on a <b>vineyard</b> <b>tractor.</b> In 1986 the new <b>vineyard</b> <b>tractor</b> was launched. in 1988, the company launched a redesigned series of tractors, the 60, 70, 80 Series.|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} in vineyards installed in terrasses. The equipment used was a <b>vineyard</b> <b>tractor</b> with a mounted air carrier sprayer with hydraulic nozzles (hollow cone nozzles). Measurements of spray deposition were made {{in different parts of}} the canopy, which were defined by three stages and two sides; the fungicide used included cupper in its composition which was removed washing the leaves being the concentration determined in laboratory with an Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. Comparative trials were made between the original sprayer and the same sprayer changed to fit to the culture, with the purpose of comparing the spray quantity and its distribution in the plants. In this tests were determined also the liquid losses to the ground...|$|E

Who {{would believe}} {{nowadays}} a mere animal {{can compete with}} the power of human engineering. This thesis has the objective {{to examine the effects of}} modern technology in viticulture in comparison to an old fashioned way of working with draft animals such as horses. Analyses were carried out during nine months and one vintage in two different vineyards with differences in cultivation practices with horses as draft animals on mostly bare soil or tractors with an alternate natural grass cover in the wine region Palatinate, Germany. Soil textures are the same in both comparable sites. The vineyard which was cultivated with horses is referred as vineyard horse and the vineyard which is cultivated mechanically is referred as <b>vineyard</b> <b>tractor.</b> Organic matter shows higher contents in the vineyard horse in topsoil as well as in subsoil. The C/N Ratio shows no big differences. Mineral contents of soil were measured as nitrogen, phosphor, potassium and magnesium with differences in values. The <b>vineyard</b> <b>tractor</b> counts with a higher average number of clusters per vine. Differences in percentage regarding total botrytis are minimal and vineyards show a higher infestation frequency in the vineyard horse but the infestation strength within the grape is lower in this vineyard. The cultivation with horses show higher values as density level, degree in Oechsle, total extract, pH, total acidity, tartaric acid and malic acid. The analyses of nutrients in must show higher contents of macronutrients in the vineyard horse as nitrogen, phosphor, potassium, calcium, sodium and magnesium. Very high differences can be found within the amounts of nitrogen. The micronutrients in must such as iron, zinc, manganese and copper resulted in very similar values. The labor in working with draft animals in vineyards is more than two times higher compared to the vineyard that is mechanized. It is necessary to get a more detailed view including more vintages and more vineyards which can be analyzed in order to come to a more scientifically sound conclusion. N/...|$|E
50|$|The Valtra S Series {{has been}} {{manufactured}} at the AGCO factory in Beauvais, France, since 2009. From 2003 to 2007 the S Series was manufactured at the Suolahti factory. Beginning in 1989 the Valmet 8300 and 8600 models were also manufactured in Beauvais {{at what was}} then the Massey Ferguson factory. At the same time Massey Ferguson began using Valmet diesel engines for its own models. Agritalia in turn manufactured Valtra 3000 Series <b>vineyard</b> <b>tractors</b> in the early 2000s.|$|R

40|$|Comparative {{tests of}} 4 systems for {{harvesting}} vineyard pruning residues {{were carried out}} using 1) a square baler; 2) a round baler; 3) a comminuter (or shredder) with drop-down re-usable containers (big bags); 4) a comminuter with built-in dumping bin. All machines were light enough for towing or carrying behind compact <b>vineyard</b> <b>tractors.</b> The machines were tested in Central Italy, on 10 ha of hill vineyard, with slope gradients ranging from 20 to 35 %. The tests included forwarding the processed residue to a central storage place 3 km away. Harvesting-processing productivity ranged from 1. 1 to 1. 7 t per scheduled machine hour (SMH), including all delays. Calculated harvesting-processing costs varied between 19. 7 and 32. 3 € t- 1, but increased from 53. 0 and 105. 2 € t- 1 when forwarding the residues to a central collection point was included. The additional cost of residue management could amount to about 25 € t- 1 (50 € ha- 1 for 2 t ha- 1). The commercial viability of recovering vineyard pruning residue also depends on the eventual redistribution of the savings accrued on residue management. The studied systems offered different products: systems 1 and 2 produced bales, which are easier to store, but are not suited for the feeding of automated furnaces, unless they are further processed into chips. However, systems 3 and 4 produced chips, which {{are more difficult to}} store but can be fed to automated furnaces without any further processing. © 2009 IAgrE...|$|R
40|$|Three {{systems for}} {{recovering}} kiwifruit pruning residues were compared for their cost-effectiveness. The systems were a shredder {{with a built-in}} dumping container; a shredder with drop-down re-usable bins, of the type normally used for fruit collection, working with a dedicated bin-collection system; and a round baler equipped with an add-on bale storage unit. All systems were light enough to be towed or carried behind a compact <b>vineyard</b> <b>tractor.</b> Harvesting and processing productivity, including all delays, ranged from 1. 8 to 3. 7 tonnes per scheduled machine hour (SMH). After standardization, calculated recovery cost varied between 8. 4 and 28. 6 Euros t- 1 for the residue delivered at the field edge. The shredder with a built-in dumping container emerged as the best performer, favored because of a faster pick-up and a more efficient single-pass work mode. Overall, this system is simpler, more productive, and offers the lowest processing cost. The annual utilization of all the dedicated recovery implements tested should at least be 50 ha year- 1 (approx. 500 t year- 1) {{in order to obtain}} acceptable cost results. Kiwifruit orchards offer a very high residue yield, about four times higher than vineyards and olive tree groves. This favors cost-effective recovery and makes them a significant potential source of energy biomass, the exploitation of which may also simplify residue management and improve plant health conditions...|$|E
5000|$|Silos & Smokestacks was {{designated}} as a national heritage area in 1996. The name is intended to reflect both the farms and industries that constitute agribusiness. The Silos & Smokestacks region covers the northeast third {{of the state of}} Iowa, including thirty-seven counties. The cities of Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Davenport, Waterloo, Dubuque, and Iowa City are all located within the region. The National Park Service recognizes over 90 community and privately operated sites in the area that interpret the story of American agriculture. These range from dairy farms and museums to <b>vineyards</b> and <b>tractor</b> assembly plants. [...] Included in the area are the Amana Colonies, Living History Farms, and Brucemore, a few of Iowa's best known tourist attractions. [...] Silos & Smokestacks also includes several state-designated scenic byways and the nationally designated Great River Road along {{the west bank of the}} Mississippi River.|$|R
