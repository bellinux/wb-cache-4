5|$|Communication using surface-borne <b>vibrational</b> signals is more {{widespread}} among insects because of size constraints in producing air-borne sounds. Insects cannot effectively produce low-frequency sounds, and high-frequency sounds tend to disperse {{more in a}} dense environment (such as foliage), so insects living in such environments communicate primarily using substrate-borne vibrations. The mechanisms of production of <b>vibrational</b> signals are just as diverse as those for producing sound in insects.|$|E
5|$|Other uses of interferometers {{have been}} to study {{dispersion}} of materials, measurement of complex indices of refraction, and thermal properties. They are also used for three-dimensional motion mapping including mapping <b>vibrational</b> patterns of structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{molecules}} {{listed below}} were detected by spectroscopy. Their spectral features are generated by transitions of component electrons between different energy levels, or by rotational or <b>vibrational</b> spectra. Detection usually occurs in radio, microwave, or infrared {{portions of the}} spectrum.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, DC {{established}} that characters appearing in comics published {{prior to the}} Silver Age lived on a parallel Earth the company dubbed Earth-Two. Characters introduced in the Silver Age and onward lived on Earth-One. It was {{established that}} the two realities were separated by a <b>vibrational</b> field that could be crossed, should a storyline involve superheroes from different worlds teaming up.|$|E
5|$|It {{is usually}} {{possible}} for a mechanical part to vibrate {{in a number of}} different modes, however the design will be based on a particular <b>vibrational</b> mode and the designer will take steps to try to restrict the resonance to this mode. As well as the straightforward longitudinal mode some others which are used include flexural mode, torsional mode, radial mode and drumhead mode.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, group theory helps {{predict the}} changes in {{physical}} properties that occur when a material undergoes a phase transition, for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a <b>vibrational</b> lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.|$|E
5|$|Spiders {{can also}} be the prey of {{aggressive}} mimics. The assassin bug Stenolemus bituberus preys on spiders, entering their web and plucking its silk threads until the spider approaches. This <b>vibrational</b> aggressive mimicry matches a general pattern of vibrations which spiders treat as prey, having a similar temporal structure and amplitude to leg and body movements of typical prey caught in the web.|$|E
5|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, {{there is only one}} kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the <b>vibrational</b> state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the <b>vibrational</b> states of a string gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E
5|$|Termites rely {{on alarm}} {{communication}} {{to defend a}} colony. Alarm pheromones can be released when the nest has been breached or is being attacked by enemies or potential pathogens. Termites always avoid nestmates infected with Metarhizium anisopliae spores, through <b>vibrational</b> signals released by infected nestmates. Other methods of defence include intense jerking and secretion of fluids from the frontal gland and defecating faeces containing alarm pheromones.|$|E
25|$|The {{applicability}} of the Franck–Condon principle in both absorption and fluorescence, along with Kasha's rule leads to an approximate mirror symmetry shown in Figure 2. The <b>vibrational</b> structure of molecules in a cold, sparse gas is most clearly visible due {{to the absence of}} inhomogeneous broadening of the individual transitions. Vibronic transitions are drawn in Figure 2 as narrow, equally spaced Lorentzian lineshapes. Equal spacing between <b>vibrational</b> levels is only the case for the parabolic potential of simple harmonic oscillators, in more realistic potentials, such as those shown in Figure 1, energy spacing decreases with increasing <b>vibrational</b> energy. Electronic transitions to and from the lowest <b>vibrational</b> states are often referred to as 0–0 (zero zero) transitions and have the same energy in both absorption and fluorescence.|$|E
25|$|The {{infrared}} spectrum of gaseous hydrogen chloride, {{shown on the}} left, consists {{of a number of}} sharp absorption lines grouped around 2886cm−1 (wavelength ~3.47µm). At room temperature, almost all molecules are in the ground <b>vibrational</b> state v=0. Including anharmonicity the <b>vibrational</b> energy can be written as.|$|E

25|$|<b>Vibrational</b> {{spectra of}} iron-57 enriched biomolecules can be {{acquired}} using nuclear resonance <b>vibrational</b> spectroscopy (NRVS) {{in which the}} sample is scanned through a range of synchrotron-generated X-rays, centered at the Mössbauer absorbance frequency. Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks in the spectrum correspond to low frequency vibrations, many below 600cm−1 with some below 100cm−1.|$|E

25|$|A given JT {{problem will}} have a {{particular}} point group symmetry, such as Td symmetry for magnetic impurity ions in semiconductors or Ih symmetry for the fullerene C60. JT problems are conventionally classified using labels for the irreducible representations (irreps) that apply to the symmetry of the electronic and <b>vibrational</b> states. For example, E ⊗ e would refer to an electronic doublet state transforming as E coupled to a <b>vibrational</b> doublet state transforming as e.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} important or fundamental IR bands arise from the excitations of normal modes, the simplest distortions of the molecule, from the ground state with <b>vibrational</b> quantum number v = 0 to the first excited state with <b>vibrational</b> quantum number v = 1. In some cases, overtone bands are observed. An overtone band arises from the absorption of a photon leading to a direct transition from the ground state to the second excited <b>vibrational</b> state (v = 2). Such a band appears at approximately twice {{the energy of the}} fundamental band for the same normal mode. Some excitations, so-called combination modes, involve simultaneous excitation of more than one normal mode. The phenomenon of Fermi resonance can arise when two modes are similar in energy; Fermi resonance results in an unexpected shift in energy and intensity of the bands etc.|$|E
25|$|Infrared <b>vibrational</b> {{frequencies}} of the O-O bond suggests a bond length fitting with superoxide (a bond order of about 1.6, with superoxide being 1.5).|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} {{published}} in 1926 in Transactions of the Faraday Society, James Franck {{was concerned with}} the mechanisms of photon-induced chemical reactions. The presumed mechanism was the excitation of a molecule by a photon, followed by a collision with another molecule during the short period of excitation. The question was whether {{it was possible for}} a molecule to break into photoproducts in a single step, the absorption of a photon, and without a collision. In order for a molecule to break apart, it must acquire from the photon a <b>vibrational</b> energy exceeding the dissociation energy, that is, the energy to break a chemical bond. However, as was known at the time, molecules will only absorb energy corresponding to allowed quantum transitions, and there are no <b>vibrational</b> levels above the dissociation energy level of the potential well. High-energy photon absorption leads to a transition to a higher electronic state instead of dissociation. In examining how much <b>vibrational</b> energy a molecule could acquire when it is excited to a higher electronic level, and whether this <b>vibrational</b> energy could be enough to immediately break apart the molecule, he drew three diagrams representing the possible changes in binding energy between the lowest electronic state and higher electronic states.|$|E
25|$|Resonant <b>vibrational</b> modes due to {{vertical}} loads (such as trains, traffic, pedestrians) and wind loads are well understood in bridge design. In {{the case of}} the Millennium Bridge, because the lateral motion caused the pedestrians loading the bridge to directly participate with the bridge, the <b>vibrational</b> modes had not been anticipated by the designers. The crucial point is that when the bridge lurches to one side, the pedestrians must adjust to keep from falling over, and they all do this at exactly the same time.|$|E
25|$|Molecules, such as oxygen (O2), {{have more}} {{degrees of freedom}} than single spherical atoms: they undergo {{rotational}} and <b>vibrational</b> motions as well as translations. Heating results {{in an increase in}} temperature due to an increase in the average translational kinetic energy of the molecules. Heating will also cause, through equipartitioning, the energy associated with <b>vibrational</b> and rotational modes to increase. Thus a diatomic gas will require more energy input to increase its temperature by a certain amount, i.e. it will have a greater heat capacity than a monatomic gas.|$|E
25|$|Flutter {{instability}} {{corresponds to}} a <b>vibrational</b> motion of increasing amplitude and is shown in Fig.6 (upper part) together with the divergence instability (lower part) consisting in an exponential growth.|$|E
25|$|In general, emitted {{fluorescent}} light has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed light. This phenomenon, known as Stokes shift, {{is due to}} energy loss between the time a photon is absorbed {{and when it is}} emitted. The causes and magnitude of Stokes shift can be complex and are dependent on the fluorophore and its environment. However, there are some common causes. It is frequently due to non-radiative decay to the lowest <b>vibrational</b> energy level of the excited state. Another factor is that the emission of fluorescence frequently leaves a fluorophore in a higher <b>vibrational</b> level of the ground state.|$|E
25|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a {{theoretical}} framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. It describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the <b>vibrational</b> state of the string. In string theory, {{one of the many}} <b>vibrational</b> states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force. Thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity.|$|E
25|$|A {{somewhat}} {{special role}} {{is played by}} tetrahedral systems like CH4+ and P4+. Here threefold degenerate electronic states and <b>vibrational</b> modes come into play. Nevertheless, also twofold degeneracies continue to be important.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} the {{rotational}} constant B is {{much smaller than the}} <b>vibrational</b> one νo, such that a much smaller amount of energy is required to rotate the molecule; for a typical molecule, this lies within the microwave region. However, the <b>vibrational</b> energy of HCl molecule places its absorptions within the infrared region, allowing a spectrum showing the rovibrational transitions of this molecule to be easily collected using an infrared spectrometer with a gas cell. The latter can even be made of quartz as the HCl absorption lies in a window of transparency for this material.|$|E
25|$|The water mite Neumania papillator (known in {{behavioral}} ecology {{as an example}} of sensory bias) is another arachnid ambush predator that uses <b>vibrational</b> stimuli in hunting - males and females perch among the fronds of aquatic vegetation in a characteristic stance termed the 'net stance' - their first four legs are held out into the water column, with their four hind legs resting on aquatic vegetation. This allows them to detect <b>vibrational</b> stimuli produced by swimming copepods, small crustaceans on whom which they prey - N. papillator then uses this information to orient towards and clutch at their prey.|$|E
25|$|Note that in {{this example}} we have assumed that {{temperature}} is low enough that heat capacities are not influenced by molecular vibration (see heat capacity). However, <b>vibrational</b> modes simply cause gammas which decrease toward 1, since vibration modes in a polyatomic gas gives the gas additional ways to store heat which do not affect temperature, and thus do not affect molecular velocity and sound velocity. Thus, the effect of higher temperatures and <b>vibrational</b> heat capacity acts to increase {{the difference between the}} speed of sound in monatomic vs. polyatomic molecules, with the speed remaining greater in monatomics.|$|E
25|$|The {{transfer}} of energy from one chemical substance to another {{depends on the}} size of energy quanta emitted from one substance. However, heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the phonons responsible for <b>vibrational</b> and rotational energy levels in a substance have much less energy than photons invoked for the electronic energy transfer. Thus, because <b>vibrational</b> and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels, heat is more easily transferred between substances relative to light or other forms of electronic energy. For example, ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy.|$|E
25|$|An exact {{amount of}} energy ħω must be {{supplied}} to the harmonic oscillator lattice to push {{it to the next}} energy level. In comparison to the photon case when the electromagnetic field is quantized, the quantum of <b>vibrational</b> energy is called a phonon.|$|E
25|$|Examples of such {{properties}} are structure (i.e., the expected {{positions of the}} constituent atoms), absolute and relative (interaction) energies, electronic charge density distributions, dipoles and higher multipole moments, <b>vibrational</b> frequencies, reactivity, or other spectroscopic quantities, and cross sections for collision with other particles.|$|E
25|$|In {{chemical}} kinetics, infrared chemiluminiscence (IRCL) {{refers to}} the emission of infrared photons from vibrationally excited product molecules immediately after their formation.
