2500|$|Many design patents {{resulted}} {{from the work of}} the ERPCC. These were transferred to a new business entity called the Transit Research Corporation (TRC) {{at the time of the}} committee's expiration in 1936. [...] Although this company would continue the work of research on improvements to the basic design of the car and would issue sets of specifications three times in the ensuing years, [...] because TRC defined a PCC car as any vehicle which utilized patents on which it collected royalties, it was formed for the primary purpose of controlling those patents and promoting the standardization envisioned by the ERPCC. [...] The company was funded by its collection of patent royalties from the railways which bought PCC cars. [...] The company was controlled by a <b>voting</b> <b>trust</b> representing the properties which had invested in the work of the ERPCC.|$|E

5000|$|Voting trusts {{are also}} {{sometimes}} used to resolve conflicts of interest. By putting the shares in a trustee who can vote them at arm's-length from the beneficiary(ies) of the trust, this can {{in some circumstances}} mitigate or absolve the original shareholder from what might otherwise constitute {{a conflict of interest}} (although in practice, to resolve conflicts of interest the trust will ordinarily be [...] "blind trust"; while all blind <b>trusts</b> are necessarily <b>voting</b> <b>trusts,</b> not all <b>voting</b> <b>trusts</b> are blind trusts).|$|R

5000|$|Since the [...] "Termination Era" [...] of the 1950s and 1960s (resulting in reduced federal {{oversight}} of Native American affairs), the Menominee tribe had been {{governed by a}} corporate body called Menominee Enterprise, Inc.. Menominee Enterprises, Inc. was controlled by a <b>voting</b> <b>trust</b> and Menominee tribal members had no shares in the corporation. Four of the <b>voting</b> <b>trust</b> members were Menominee; however, five votes were required {{in order for the}} trust to take action. In the 1960s and 1970s there was renewed Congressional involvement in rebuilding tribal infrastructure, both socially and economically.|$|E
5000|$|Parts of the Act {{were quite}} radical for the time. The Act {{abolished}} {{the concept of}} ultra vires for companies, considerably restricted the requirement for corporate benefit, it permitted companies to change their corporate domicile from one jurisdiction to another, it allowed [...] "true merger" [...] of two different corporate entities, and introduced the concept of <b>voting</b> <b>trusts</b> to the jurisdiction.|$|R

40|$|A paper {{describes}} the {{problems faced by}} reorganizers of distressed railroads in the late 19 th century {{and how they were}} addressed by a combination of judicial intervention and financial innovations. In particular, the judicial innovations of supersenior financing, the equity receivership process, and the setting of upset values permitted firms to raise funds. The private financial innovations of deferred coupon debt, contingent charge securities, and <b>voting</b> <b>trusts</b> made subsequent default less likely. The private innovations can be interpreted as responses to both the distress of the railroads as well as the intervention by the courts that emasculated prior debt contracts...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>voting</b> <b>trust</b> is an {{arrangement}} whereby the shares {{in a company}} {{of one or more}} shareholders and the voting rights attached thereto are legally transferred to a trustee, usually for a specified period of time (the [...] "trust period"). In some voting trusts, the trustee may also be granted additional powers (such as to sell or redeem the shares). At the end of the trust period, the shares would ordinarily be re-transferred to the beneficiary(ies), although in practice many voting trusts contain provisions for them to re-vested on the voting trusts with identical terms.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the defeat}} of its plan, the D&H sold its stock to the Pennsylvania Railroad. In the {{following}} years, the Pennsylvania quietly obtained more stock, both directly and through railroads it controlled, primarily the Wabash. By 1931, the PRR controlled 51% of the LVRR stock. Following Loomis' death in 1937, the presidency went to Loomis' assistant Duncan J. Kerr, but in 1940 he was replaced by Albert N. Williams, and the road came {{under the influence of}} the PRR.

50|$|It was in 1910 that Mr. Wood {{was named}} a {{vice-president}} of the General Motors Company, and thus became associated with a concern {{of which he was}} still an officer {{at the time of his}} death. He did resign from the company when control of it was placed in the hands of a <b>voting</b> <b>trust,</b> but in 1915 he once more became connected with W.C. Durant, president of the concern, and the following year was chosen a director. Another important concern with which Wood was connected was the Industrial Savings Bank of Flint, it being his efforts that secured the required stock subscriptions which resulted in its organization.|$|E

In 2004, Prichard pushed out John Honderich as publisher of the Toronto Star because he resisted making the deep cost cuts that Prichard demanded. However, in 2006, Honderich, a Torstar director who chairs a <b>voting</b> <b>trust</b> comprising five families that control Torstar, instigated a [...] "coup" [...] among the five families that resulted in the termination of Prichard's chosen publisher Michael Goldbloom and editor-in-chief Giles Gherson. [...] Some have suggested that Torstar's financial woes have been caused by Prichard's distraction by his presence on several boards, including Onex and Four Seasons.|$|E
5000|$|The Chandler Acts of 1938-1939 {{provided}} {{a new form}} of relief for railroads, allowing them to restructure their debt while continuing to operate. The LV was approved for such a restructuring in 1940 when several large mortgage loans were due. The restructuring allowed the LV to extend the maturity of its mortgages, but needed to repeat the process in 1950. [...] The terms of the restructurings precluded dividend payments until 1953 when LV common stock paid the first dividend since 1931. In 1940 the LV came {{under the influence of the}} PRR. In 1941, the Pennsylvania placed its shares in a <b>voting</b> <b>trust</b> after reaching an agreement with the New York Central regarding the PRR's purchase of the Wabash.

50|$|Two final blows {{fell in the}} 1950s: {{the passage}} of the Federal-Aid Highway Act in 1956, better known as the Interstate Highway Act, and the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959. The interstate {{highways}} helped the trucking industry offer door-to-door service, and the St. Lawrence Seaway allowed grain shipments to bypass the railways and go directly to overseas markets. By the 1960s railroads in the East were struggling to survive. The Pennsylvania Railroad in 1962 requested ICC authorization to acquire complete control of the LVRR through a swap of PRR stock for LVRR and elimination of the <b>voting</b> <b>trust</b> that had been in place since 1941. It managed to acquire more than 85% of all outstanding shares, and from that time the LVRR {{was little more than a}} division of the PRR. The Pennsylvania merged with the New York Central in 1968, but the Penn Central failed in 1970, causing a cascade of failures throughout the East.|$|E
5000|$|By 1912, Fresno's {{dominant}} industry, raisins, was {{in terrible}} shape. Prices were {{so low that}} they did not cover production costs. M. Theo Kearney's attempt to organize the raisin farmers had failed in 1904. After his death in 1906, several industry groups tried unsuccessfully between 1907 and 1912 to follow the Kearney model of a capitalized raisin cooperative. A group of prominent growers and Fresno businessmen, and Sutherland as their lawyer, formed the California Associated Raisin Company (later known as Sun-Maid). Similar to the Kearney model, the company had both grower members and nongrower investors. The trustees of a <b>voting</b> <b>trust</b> controlled all the shares and elected the seven directors. A novel feature devised by Sutherland and Fresno lawyers H.H. Welsh and M.K. Harris was the three-year grower contract, subject to a two-year renewal, binding the grower to deliver all of his crop for a guaranteed price. The vompany signed up 76% of the raisin acreage and raised $800,000 in capital, and began operations in April 1913.|$|E
