40|$|With the advancements in {{wireless}} {{networks and}} the pervasive adoptions of smartphones with camera capabilities, {{hundreds of millions}} mobile users are attracted to <b>video</b> <b>messaging</b> services on their smartphones. Unlike text <b>messaging,</b> transmitting large <b>video</b> <b>messages</b> (with a size of ∼ 10 MBytes vs. a 140 Bytes limit for text messages) demands effective network resource provisioning. In this work, we investigate current practices of video messag-ing on smartphones. Focusing on the two most popular <b>video</b> <b>messaging</b> services, WhatsApp and WeChat, we conduct exten-sive experiments with commodity smartphones based on the three mainstream mobile OSes, namely, iOS, Android, and Windows Phone, from both the USA and China. We find that WhatsApp and WeChat have different resource provisioning strategies when serving <b>video</b> <b>messaging</b> clients, leading to a degraded service ex-perience for WeChat users compared to WhatsApp users. Neither WhatsApp nor WeChat provides location aware service that can significantly improve the user experience. We further evaluate a few enhancements that can help reduce end-to-end delay in <b>video</b> <b>messaging</b> services. Our results provide new insights for both ser-vice providers and users {{for this type of}} newly emerging services...|$|R
