40|$|The {{ability to}} spread from cell to cell {{may be an}} {{important}} virulence determinant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. An in vitro assay was developed to characterize this ability among four strains of M. tuberculosis: the attenuated strain H 37 Ra, the <b>virulent</b> <b>strains</b> H 37 Rv and Erdman, and a virulent clinical isolate (Stew). Confluent monolayers of human skin fibroblasts were infected with these strains and overlaid with agar-medium. M. tuberculosis infection developed over 21 days as microcolonies originating within the plane of the fibroblasts. Microcolonies of the <b>virulent</b> <b>strains</b> had an elongated appearance and exhibited extensive cording. The cords appeared to invade adjacent cells within the plane of the monolayer. Microcolony diameter of the Erdman strain was significantly larger than that of the other <b>virulent</b> <b>strains,</b> indicating that <b>virulent</b> <b>strains</b> can have distinguishing phenotypes in this assay. In contrast, avirulent H 37 Ra microcolonies were rounded and noncorded. H 37 Ra microcolonies were significantly smaller than those of the <b>virulent</b> <b>strains.</b> Microcolony diameter of the <b>virulent</b> <b>strains</b> was not reduced by the extracellularly acting antibiotic streptomycin at concentrations of up to 5. 0 mg/ml. In contrast, H 37 Ra microcolony size was reduced at concentrations as low as 0. 5 mg/ml. Growth of all strains was similarly inhibited by 1. 0 mg of streptomycin per ml in fibroblast-conditioned tissue culture medium alone.

25|$|This belle époque {{lasted until}} the First World War, when as a {{consequence}} of hostilities, notably in Germany whence at least 40 cultivars originated, and of the outbreak {{at about the same time}} of the early strain of Dutch elm disease, Ophiostoma ulmi, the elm began its slide into horticultural decline. The devastation caused by the Second World War, and the demise in 1944 of the huge Späth nursery in Berlin, only accelerated the process.

25|$|The first, less {{aggressive}} {{strain of the}} disease fungus, Ophiostoma ulmi, arrived in Europe from the Far East in 1910, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1928, but was steadily weakened by viruses and had all but disappeared in Europe by the 1940s. The second, far more <b>virulent</b> <b>strain</b> of the disease Ophiostoma novo-ulmi was identified in Europe in the late 1960s, and within a decade had killed over 20 million trees (approximately 75%) in the UK alone. Approximately three times more deadly, the new strain arrived in Europe from the US on a cargo of Rock Elm; the hypothesis that it arose from a hybrid between the original O. ulmi and another strain endemic to the Himalaya, Ophiostoma himal-ulmi is now discredited.|$|E

[...] It was the culmination of research in the 1930s and early 20th Century at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research to purify and characterize the [...] "transforming principle" [...] responsible for the transformation phenomenon first described in Griffith's experiment of 1928: killed Streptococcus pneumoniae of the <b>virulent</b> <b>strain</b> type III-S, when injected along with living but non-virulent type II-R pneumococci, resulted in a deadly infection of type III-S pneumococci.

40|$|Staphylococcus hyicus strains with {{different}} phage types, plasmid profiles, and antibiotic resistance patterns were isolated from piglets with exudative epidermitis.

The results showed that both <b>virulent</b> and avirulent <b>strains</b> were present simultaneously on diseased piglets. This constitutes a diagnostic problem. Concentrated culture supernatants from nine <b>virulent</b> <b>strains</b> injected in the skin of healthy piglets produced a crusting reaction in all piglets.
