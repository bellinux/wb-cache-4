40|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} (CAH) is {{a disorder}} of adrenal steroid synthesis. In 95 % of CAH cases, it {{is caused by}} 21 -hydroxylase deficiency, leading to cortisol deficiency and (in most cases) aldosterone deficiency. The compensatory increase in ACTH secretion by the pituitary gland leads to stimulation of the adrenal glands and, consequently, overproduction of androgens. The classic form is well known due to the congenital <b>virilisation</b> seen in affected girls. However, the cortisol and aldosterone deficiency is at least equally important in both sexes as it can cause an Addisonian crisis within the first weeks of life. For these reasons, a neonatal CAH screening program has been introduced in the Netherlands. Screening results in earlier detection and treatment. The prevalence of the classic form of the disease is 1 : 12. 000 in the Netherlands. Non-classic 21 -hydroxylase deficiency is more frequent, presenting with signs of androgen excess from childhood through to adulthood. Treatment of CAH consists of hormonal replacement and surgical correction in case of congenital <b>virilisation</b> in girls. Long-term treatment results, including height at adulthood, have improved over the last decades. Nevertheless, fertility problems can occur in both sexes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: Aromatase {{deficiency}} {{may result}} in a complete block of estrogen synthesis because of the failure to convert androgens to estrogens. In females, this results in <b>virilisation</b> at birth, ovarian cysts in prepuberty and lack of pubertal development but <b>virilisation,</b> thereafter. Objective and methods: We studied the impact of oral 17 β-estradiol treatment on ovarian and uterine development, and on LH/FSH and inhibin B during the long-term follow-up of a girl harboring compound heterozygote point mutations in the CYP 19 A 1 gene. Results: In early childhood, low doses of oral 17 β-estradiol were needed. During prepuberty treatment with slowly increasing doses of E 2 resulted in normal uterine and almost normal development of ovarian volume, as well as number and size of follicles. Regarding hormonal feedback mechanisms, inhibin B levels were in the upper normal range during childhood and puberty. Low doses of estradiol did not suffice to achieve physiological gonadotropin levels in late prepuberty and puberty. However, when estradiol doses were further increased in late puberty levels of both FSH and LH declined with estradiol levels within normal range. Conclusion: Complete aromatase deficiency provides an excellent model of how ovarian and uterine development in relation to E 2, LH, FSH and inhibin B feedback progresses from infancy to adolescence...|$|E

Recurrent maternal <b>virilisation</b> is rare (seven previous reports) and this case is unique in its severity. Differential diagnoses include ovarian disease and fetal aromatase deficiency. New techniques to exclude a fetal cause were used in this case. This patient presented during the third trimester of her first pregnancy with rapid onset of hirsuitism, increased musculature, and deepening voice. A blood hormone profile revealed significant hyperandrogenism (testosterone, 72. 4 nmol/litre; normal range, 0. 5 – 3. 0). She delivered a normal boy and maternal androgen concentrations returned rapidly to normal (testosterone, 0. 8 nmol/litre). She presented two years later, during her second pregnancy, with similar symptoms and biochemistry (testosterone, 47. 5 nmol/litre). Again, she delivered a healthy normal boy and androgens returned immediately to normal (serum testosterone, 2. 0 nmol/litre). Ultrasonography revealed no evidence of ovarian (or adrenal) masses in either pregnancy. Umbilical cord venous blood sampling and placental assays revealed no evidence of fetal aromatase deficiency. Recurrent hyperandrogenism during pregnancy is rare. Ovarian luteoma rarely recurs and hyperreactio luteinalis does not lead to such pronounced androgen concentrations.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} (CAH) is {{a relatively}} common condition with a population carrier frequency of 1 : 50. Antenatal administration of dexamethasone treatment {{has been used to}} reduce <b>virilisation</b> in affected female offspring. There is however, considerable national/international variability regarding this treatment, including significant concerns about the potential maternal and fetal side effects. METHODS: A questionnaire including 3 clinical scenarios was devised covering aspects of prenatal management in cases of CAH. This was designed to identify opinions and management strategies in cases with a familial diagnosis of CAH. Confidence in the effectiveness of dexamethasone in the prevention of <b>virilisation</b> was also questioned. A link to the Survey Monkey questionnaire was circulated via fetal, obstetric, genetic and paediatric endocrinology specialists. Replies were then collated and assessed. RESULTS: 64 practitioners replied (19. 7 % Consultant Geneticists, 16. 4 % Consultants in Fetal Medicine, 44. 3 % Consultant Obstetricians, 14. 8 % other health care professionals). The results demonstrated significant uncertainty and variation in clinical management. Many recommended discussing with colleagues and or seeking further advice and guidance. CONCLUSION: There is no nationally consistent approach to prenatal and post natal diagnosis and management of mothers and babies at risk of CAH.

40|$|AIM: To analyse {{critically}} {{a protocol}} {{for the investigation}} of girls presenting with <b>virilisation</b> in childhood. METHODS: Twenty five girls aged 1. 6 - 8. 7 years with features of <b>virilisation</b> were evaluated. Twenty four had presented with pubic hair, eight with auxilliary hair, seven with facial acne, four with clitoromegaly, and 10 with tall stature. They underwent clinical assessment (height, weight, height velocity, staging of puberty, physical examination for acne, body odour, and clitoromegaly) and laboratory assessment comprising basal concentrations of cortisol, 17 OH-progesterone (17 OHP), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosteronesulphate (DHEAS), testosterone, and oestradiol. The above steroids were also measured during the short synacthen test (0. 25 mg intramuscularly) in 16 subjects and low dose dexamethasone suppression tests (0. 5 mg at six hourly intervals over 48 hours). Pelvic ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of adrenals were carried out when the biochemical findings suggested {{that there might be}} an autonomous source of androgen secretion. RESULTS: Clinical and laboratory assessments differentiated the patients into three diagnostic categories: adrenarche (18 cases), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (five cases), and adrenocortical tumour (two cases). The last had elevated concentrations of DHEAS, 1. 5 and 19. 1 mumol/l (normal value < 0. 5 mumol/l), androstenedione, 24. 6 and 21. 8 nmol/l (normal < 1 nmol/l), and testosterone, 4. 5 and 2. 4 nmol/l (normal < 0. 8 nmol/l), with none suppressing on dexamethasone suppression. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia subjects had elevated basal serum concentrations of 17 OHP (n = 4) : 250, 140, 14, and 14. 1 nmol/l (normal < 10 nmol/l) and elevated peak values of 17 OHP after synacthen (n = 3) : 76, 179. 5, and 175 nmol/l. Adrenarche patients had elevated basal concentrations of DHEAS (median: 2. 3 mumol/l; n = 17) and androstenedione (median 2. 6 nmol/l; n = 17). Nine patients also had elevated basal serum testosterone concentrations (median 0. 9 nmol/l). Peak values of 17 OHP after synacthen were significantly different from baseline (n = 12) and were < 50 % of the lowest value in congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Serum DHEAS, androstenedione, and testosterone suppressed following dexamethasone suppression (n = 16), thereby distinguishing adrenarche patients from adrenal tumour patients. Clinical details did not distinguish patients, except for clitoromegaly which was present only in the tumour and congenital adrenal hyperplasia patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Cushing's disease (CD) in prepubertal {{children}} {{is very rare}} and presents important diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We report experience of the management of this subpopulation of CD patients. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Retrospective patient case note review. RESULTS: Between 1985 and 2008, 17 prepubertal children (13 M, 4 F), aged 5. 7 - 14. 1 years presented to our centre for diagnosis and management of CD. All children had subnormal linear growth and excessive weight gain at presentation. A high proportion (85 % of males, 75 % of females) had evidence of excessive <b>virilisation.</b> Striae and hypertension were seen in 41 % of patients. The investigation with highest sensitivity (100 %) for CD was excessive increase of serum cortisol to i. v. CRH (mean increase 113 %). Pituitary imaging performed in all the patients showed poor concordance with findings at surgery (31 %). In contrast bilateral simultaneous inferior petrosal sinus sampling (BSIPSS), performed in 11 / 16 subjects showed a high correlation with surgical findings (91 %). In 16 patients, transsphenoidal selective adenomectomy (TSS) achieved a cure rate of 44 %. However, in the 11 patients who had pre-operative BSIPSS, the cure rate was 64 %. Of the 16 patients, 9 patients who were not cured by TSS received external pituitary radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Prepubertal CD had distinctive features with increased frequency in males, abnormal auxology and excessive <b>virilisation.</b> The cortisol response to i. v.

40|$|In {{foetuses}} {{at risk of}} virilising congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), prenatal {{treatment can}} be offered by administration of dexamethasone (DEX) via the mother, in order to suppress foetal adrenal androgen oversecretion and prevent genital malformations. The first treated cases were described 20 years ago, and several hundred pregnancies have been reported since. There is a consensus that the treatment effectively prevents or reduces <b>virilisation,</b> but opinions regarding its safety differ. Rare adverse events {{have been reported in}} treated children, but no harmful effect has been documented that can be clearly attributed to the treatment. However, few treated foetuses have been followed until adolescence. Animal studies and epidemiological data point to various adverse effects of excess glucocorticoids on the developing foetus. In order to prevent <b>virilisation</b> effectively in females affected with CAH, the prenatal treatment needs to be instituted in the early first trimester, before pre-natal diagnosis is possible. Thus, a majority of treated foetuses will receive DEX unnecessarily. The PREDEX study was initiated in Stockholm in 1999 as an open, controlled, non-randomised, multicentre trial. Participating centres are Stockholm, Bergen, Kuopio, Warsaw, London, Lyon and Barcelona. The study has been approved by the ethics committees in each country. The purpose of PREDEX is to evaluate prospectively the prenatal treatment regarding efficacy in preventing virilisa-tion as well as to study its safety for both mothers and treated children. Children are followed until 18 years of age and a wide range of physiological, metabolic and developmental parameters are considered. In Sweden, treatment is not offered outside the frames of the trial. European Journal of Endocrinology 151 U 63 –U 6...|$|E
40|$|A Turkish boy was {{referred}} {{at the age}} of 3 6 / 12 years for the evaluation of a premature moustache. No other signs of <b>virilisation</b> were present. The endocrine evaluation led to the diagnosis of nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Genetic analysis revealed 2 rare mutations of the CYP 21 A 2 gene, the gene encoding for the 21 -hydroxylase enzyme: a recently reported R 132 C mutation in exon 3 and a R 339 H mutation in exon 8, both reported in the nonclassic CAH. An early moustache, for which the term premature moustache can be coined, can be the presenting symptom of nonclassic CAH. In all children presenting with a sex or age inappropriate development of a moustache, an endocrine evaluation is indicated...|$|E
40|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} is the commonest adrenal {{disorder in}} infancy and childhood and {{results from a}} deficiency in the activity {{of one of the}} five enzymes required for cortisol biosynthesis. 1 More than 90 % of cases are due to a deficiency of 21 -hydroxylase enzymes required for the conversion of 170 H-progesterone to 11 -deoxycortisol and of progesterone to 11 -deoxycorticosterone. The inheri-tance is autosomal recessive and the monogenic trait is closely linked to the HLA locus on chromosome 6. 2 A further 5 % of cases are associated with a deficiency of the 11 i-hydroxylase enzyme involved in the terminal steps of cortisol and aldosterone biosynthesis. The clinical hallmark of both enzyme defects is <b>virilisation</b> consequent upon increase...|$|E
40|$|In tro duc ti on 21 -hydroxylase {{deficiency}} (21 -OHD) is {{the most}} common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH, OMIM 201910) and causes in-utero and postnatal <b>virilisation</b> of females due to increased adrenal androgens. While neonatal ovarian cysts have been reported to occur in association with placental dysfunction, maternal diabetes, and toxemia, only three cases of solitary neonatal ovarian cysts associated with CAH have been reported to date (1, 2). In 21 -OHD, multiple small ovarian cysts (microcysts) can develop, especially in adolescents with the nonclassical form of the disease (3). There is only one report of multiple ovarian cysts in a neonate with the classical form of 21 -OHD (4), whereas unilateral solitary giant ovarian cyst has not yet been reported in these patients...|$|E
40|$|To try {{and find}} out if a defect in {{androgen}} biosynthesis or action could {{be responsible for the}} incomplete <b>virilisation</b> seen in boys with isolated hypospadias and isolated micropenis, androgen receptor binding was studied in genital skin fibroblasts established from 18 boys with isolated micropenis and 19 boys with isolated hypospadias. The production of gonadotrophins and testosterone was also measured in the boys with micropenis. There was no evidence of gonadotrophin deficiency, or of a defect in testosterone biosynthesis in the boys with micropenis, and {{there was no evidence of}} a quantitative or qualitative defect of androgen binding in either group. These isolated abnormalities may be the result of transient defects in androgen synthesis or action, or both, during a critical phase of embryogenesis...|$|E
