40|$|Videolaryngoscopy {{has become}} {{increasingly}} attractive for the routine management of the difficult airway. Glidescope® is well studied in the literature while imago V-Blade® is a recent videolaryngoscope. This is a feasibility study with 1 : 1 case-control sequential allocation comparing Imago <b>V-Blade</b> ® and Glidescope® in predicted difficult airway settings...|$|E
40|$|Shallow {{subsurface}} tillage {{can control}} weeds and maintain surface residues in conservation tillage systems. Our objective was t o determine {{the efficacy of}} using subsurface tillage for weed control in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) grown in a reseeding crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) winter cover production system. Treatments {{in the study were}} planting date (15 April, 29 April, and 24 May), winter cover (fallow or 'Dixie ' crimson clover), and midrow weed control method (<b>V-blade</b> cultivator and glyphosate application). Soil type was Norfolk loamy sand (fine, loamy, siliceous, thermic, Typic Kandiudult). Weed control methods were compared in the first t w o planting dates in late May. At one week after treatment, weed control in the mid-rows was similar between glyphosate application and subsurface tillage in both planting dates and both winter cover treatments. Subsurface tillage reduced residue cover in the midrows by 8 %. Weed control treatments were applied t o all planting dates in late June. Clover successfully reseeded following both weed control methods. These preliminary data suggest that further investigation o f subsurface tillage in reseeding crimson clover cotton production systems is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Three 0. 02 hectare plot-watersheds were {{installed}} on a saline {{soil in the}} Davy Crockett National Forest near Apple Springs, Texas. Each plot was installed with an H-flume, FW- 1 automatic water level recorder, Coshocton N- 1 runoff sampler, and two storage tanks. One watershed was undisturbed forested and served a control, one was clearcut without any site-preparation, and the third was clearcut, <b>V-blade</b> sheared, windrowed, and vegetation regrowth was prevented for the first 2 years. A total of 274 storms were recorded during the four-year study period, 1989 - 1992. Average annual sediment losses for the study period were 55, 197, and 1, 530 kilograms per hectare per year for the control, commercial clearcut, and sheared plots, respectively. These losses are about average for most studies conducted in East Texas and the Southeast and are well below average losses for all land uses in the Southeast. Sediment losses and surface runoff were significantly greater from the sheared plot-watershed than from the control and the commercial clearcut plots. Employing Wischmeier and Smith’s (1978) long-term average Rvalue for the USLE overestimated annual sediment yield for the study period, while two shortcut models developed in the United States resulted in more accurate predictions and are good substitutes for the long-term R-value. Total losses in surface runoff of PO 4, NO 3, NO 2, TKN, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Al, Fe, Zn, and Cu were higher on the site-prepared plot watershed than the other two. Losses of PO 4, TKN, and NO 2 were higher on the commercial clearcut plot than the control. Losses were not high enough to adversely affect forest productivity. Concentrations of elements were generally below established USEPA surface water quality standards and were not high enough to adversely affect plant growth...|$|E
40|$|Dissolved {{organic carbon}} (DOC) {{dynamics}} were investigated in three small wetland catchments: one {{covered by a}} scrub forest {{and the other two}} cleared, <b>V‐bladed,</b> and planted with pine, 1 and 4 years before sampling. Over a 4 ‐month sampling period, DOC concentrations averaged 1. 4, 20. 9, 47. 1, 46. 0, and 45. 7 mg/L in precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, surface soil water, and subsoil water, respectively, in the scrub forest catchment. DOC concentration in the stream draining the catchment averaged 43. 4 mg/L, reflecting the inability of the Larry River subsoils to adsorb DOC and the pathways taken by water. In 1986, discharge‐weighted DOC concentrations in the streams ranged from 29. 9 mg/L in the catchment disturbed 4 years before sampling to 35. 0 mg/L in the recently disturbed catchment and 37. 9 mg/L in the catchment covered by scrub forest. DOC export from the catchments in 1986 was estimated to be 30. 6, 43. 8, and 41. 7 g m− 2 yr− 1, suggesting that disturbance had a minor effect on DOC export. The role of the high DOC concentrations on the chemistry of the stream water was revealed by a large anion deficit, an average anion deficit:DOC relationship of 5. 7 meq/g, and an annual export of acidity of 184 – 263 meq m− 2 yr− 1. Within‐storm sampling showed that pH and DOC were related inversely and base titration suggested acid dissociation constants (pKa) ranging from 4. 4 to 4. 9...|$|R
40|$|Soil loss through {{wind and}} water erosion is an ongoing problem in {{semiarid}} regions. A thin layer of top soil loss over a hectare of cropland could be corresponding to tons of productive soil loss per hectare. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the influence of beef feedlot manure, tillage and legume grass mixtures on changes in soil quality and nutrient components. The study was initiated in 2006 on an eroded site near Akron, Colorado, on a Norka-Colby very-fine sandy loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic, Aridic, Argiustolls). Tillage treatments were no-tillage, shallow tillage (sweeps operations with <b>V-blade)</b> and deep tillage (DT; moldboard plow operations). In one set of plots, DT was implemented biannually (DT- 2); and in another set the DT was done once at the initiation of the experiment in 2006. Amendments consisted of beef manure and urea (46 - 0 - 0), N fertilizer. Both amendments were added at low and high rates. A control treatment, with no fertilizer or manure added, was included with no-tillage and shallow tillage only. Six years of manure addition and tillage significantly altered soil chemical properties compared with fertilizer and grass legume mixtures. Across all the tillage treatments, at the 0 - 30 cm depth, soil pH from 2006 to 2012, was reduced 1. 8 fold with high-manure compared with high-fertilizer treatment. Soil EC, Na, and SAR increased by 2. 7 fold while soil P increase by 3. 5 fold with high-manure treatment compared with low-manure from 2006 to 2012 across all the tillage treatments at the surface 0 - 30 cm. Soil organic carbon associated with high-manure was 71 % higher than low-manure and 230 % higher than high-fertilizer treatments in the 0 - 60 cm depth. Similar patterns were observed with soil total N. Overall, manure amendments greatly improved the soil nutrient status on this eroded site. However, the legume grass mixtures showed little effect on improving soils chemical properties. The micronutrients supplied by manure improved the soil nutrient status compared with inorganic fertilizer, the grass, and the grass-legume treatments. We concluded that more than six years are needed to measure significant improvements in soil quality from specific treatments, specifically fertilizer, grasses, and grass-legume mixtures in such eroded crop land...|$|E
