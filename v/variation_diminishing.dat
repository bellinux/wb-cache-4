We {{hypothesized that the}} seasonal variation of non-typhoid Salmonella occurrence in humans diminishes with increased severity of infection. We examined the seasonal variation of non-typhoid Salmonella infections in three patient groups with differing severity of infection: outpatients treated for gastroenteritis (n= 1490); in-patients treated for gastroenteritis (n= 492); and in-patients treated for bacteraemia (n= 113). The study was population-based and included all non-typhoid Salmonella patients in a Danish county from 1994 to 2003. A periodic regression model was used to compute the peak-to-trough ratio for the three patient groups. The peak-to-trough ratios were 4 · 3 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3 · 6 – 5 · 0] for outpatients with gastroenteritis, 3 · 2 (95 % CI 2 · 4 – 4 · 2) for in-patients with gastroenteritis, and 1 · 6 (95 % CI 1 · 0 – 2 · 8) for in-patients with bacteraemia.

40|$|Abstract. We study Small–World graphs in the {{perspective}} of their use {{in the development of}} efficient as well as easy to implement network infrastructures. Our analysis starts from the Small–World model proposed by Kleinberg: a grid network augmented with directed long–range random links. The choices of the long–range links are independent from one node to another. In this setting greedy routing and some of its variants have been analyzed and shown to produce paths of polylogarithmic expected length. We start from asking whether all the independence assumed in the Kleinberg’s model among long–range contacts of different nodes is indeed necessary to assure the existence of short paths. In order to deal with the above question, we impose (stringent) restrictions on the choice of long–range links and we show that such restrictions do not increase the average path length of greedy routing and of its <b>variations.</b> <b>Diminishing</b> the randomness in the choice of random links has several benefits; in particular, it implies an increase in the clustering of the graph, thus increasing the resilience of the network. ...|$|R

The airplanes are the X- 5 (590 wing sweep), XF- 92 A, YF- 102 with cambered wing, YF- 102 with symmetrical wing, D- 558 -ii, X- 3, and X-LE. The effects {{of some of}} the basic configuration differences on the lift and drag characteristics are demonstrated. As indicated by transonic similarity laws, most of the configurations demonstrate a relationship between the transonic increase in zero-lift drag and the maximum cross-sectional area. No such relationship was found between the drag-rise Mach number and its normally related parameters. A comparison of flight and wind-tunnel data shows a generally reasonable agreement, but Reynolds number differences can cause considerable variations in the drag levels of the flight and wind-tunnel tests. Maximum lift-drag ratios vary widely in the subsonic region as would be expected from differences in aspect ratio and wing thickness ratio; however, the <b>variations</b> <b>diminish</b> as the Mach number is increased through the transonic region.

40|$|Lagging {{exposure}} {{information is}} often undertaken {{to allow for}} a latency period in cumulative exposure-disease analyses. The authors first consider bias and confidence interval coverage when using the standard approaches of fitting models under several lag assumptions and selecting the lag that maximizes either the effect estimate or model goodness of fit. Next, they consider bias that occurs when the assumption that the latency period is a fixed constant does not hold. Expressions were derived for bias due to misspecification of lag assumptions, and simulations were conducted. Finally, the authors describe a method for joint estimation of parameters describing an exposure-response association and the latency distribution. Analyses of associations between cumulative asbestos exposure and lung cancer mortality among textile workers illustrate this approach. Selecting the lag that maximizes the effect estimate may lead to bias away from the null; selecting the lag that maximizes model goodness of fit may lead to confidence intervals that are too narrow. These problems tend to increase as the within-person exposure <b>variation</b> <b>diminishes.</b> Lagging exposure assignment by a constant will lead to bias toward the null if the distribution of latency periods is not a fixed constant.

The bio-monitoring surveillance data collected in local agencies reflected the local temporal trends of children's blood lead levels (BLLs).

We attempted to quantify the long-term trends of children's BLLs in the city of Syracuse, New York and evaluate the impacts of local lead poisoning prevention programs and Lead Hazard Control Program on reducing the children's BLLs. We applied interrupted time series analysis on the monthly time series of BLLs surveillance data and used ARMA (autoregressive and moving average) models to measure the average children's blood lead level shift and detect the seasonal pattern change. Our results showed that there were three intervention stages over the past 20 years to reduce children's BLLs in the city of Syracuse, NY.
