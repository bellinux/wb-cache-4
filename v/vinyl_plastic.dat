50|$|An eraser, (also {{called a}} rubber outside America, from the {{material}} first used) is {{an article of}} stationery that is used for removing writing from paper or skin. Erasers have a rubbery consistency and {{come in a variety}} of shapes, sizes and colours. Some pencils have an eraser on one end. Less expensive erasers are made from synthetic rubber and synthetic soy-based gum, but more expensive or specialized erasers are <b>vinyl,</b> <b>plastic,</b> or gum-like materials.|$|E
50|$|Another {{style of}} truck bed tonneau cover is a {{retractable}} unit, which is mounted {{at the front}} and sides {{of the bed and}} rolls up or retracts from the tailgate towards the cab. The retractable tonneau is typically made of <b>vinyl,</b> <b>plastic</b> or aluminum. Retractable tonneaus are more secure than soft tonneau covers, since they usually lock and are made from a harder composition, but they take more time to install and are designed for semi-permanent installation.|$|E

40|$|Certain {{phthalate}} esters used {{widely in}} <b>vinyl</b> <b>plastics</b> and other consumer products {{have been associated}} with impaired neurodevel-opment, 1 altered genital development, 2 and respiratory problems 3 in people. Studies of dermal absorption of phthalates have largely focused on direct contact of the skin with the chemicals, but some models predict that transdermal uptake directly from ambient air may be a potentially important route of expo-sure. 4 In this issue of EHP, researchers confirm experimentally in humans that dermal uptake from indoor air may be a meaningful exposure pathway for some phthalates. 5 In a series of experiments, six participants were exposed to elevated air concentrations of diethyl phthalate (DEP) and di(n-butyl) phthal-ate (DnBP). DEP is used as a solvent and car...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, <b>vinyl</b> <b>plastic</b> {{emerged as a}} {{versatile}} material {{for a wide range}} of applications, from shower curtains to cable insulation. A major ingredient in vinyl film was tricresyl phosphate (TCP), which was used as a plasticizer. Unfortunately, TCP tended to migrate, giving the surface of the vinyl film an oily quality and degrading every tape adhesive known. Research chemists and engineers at 3M set out to create a dependable, pressure-sensitive tape made of vinyl film that would have the required electrical, physical and chemical properties.|$|E
5000|$|With a savvy eye for {{marketing}} and innovation, Alexander became {{a leader in}} the American dollmaking industry. In 1947 she began producing dolls from hard plastic, and in the 1960s turned to <b>vinyl</b> <b>plastic,</b> which rendered a more lifelike appearance. She introduced [...] "eyes with lashes that closed and fingers with knuckles", and rooted hair that could be styled. She researched historical and cultural dress to fashion accurately-detailed dolls' clothing, and insisted on quality workmanship. Materials used to clothe the dolls were made of [...] "silks, velvets, satins and other fine fabrics".|$|E
5000|$|In 1969, {{designer}} Roy Wilson and the G. Heileman Brewing Company {{constructed a}} set of metal tanks, holding a total of 22,220 barrels of beer, adjacent to their La Crosse brewery. The tanks were used for inventory storage and were painted in the colors of a six-pack of Old Style. For publicity purposes, the brewery called the tanks the [...] "World's Largest Six-Pack". The tanks continued in use as of 2016 by City Brewing, although the Old Style logo had been painted over and replaced by <b>vinyl</b> <b>plastic</b> sheaths printed with the colors and packaging style of City's La Crosse Lager.|$|E
50|$|In {{the days}} before home air {{conditioning}} was available, it was common to put slipcovers on upholstered furniture in the hot {{months of the year}} to protect the upholstery fabric from sweat, and slipcover tailors offered clear <b>vinyl,</b> or <b>plastic</b> slipcovers.

Later examples contained a metal noisemaker {{known as a}} [...] "whistle disk." [...] Brightly colored rubber squeaky toys molded in various shapes became common during the 1940s. Later examples were molded from durable <b>vinyl,</b> and <b>plastic</b> squeakers replaced metal whistles.|$|R
5000|$|A {{chessboard}} is {{the type}} of checkerboard used in the board game chess, consisting of 64 squares (eight rows and eight columns). The squares are arranged in two alternating colors (light and dark). Wooden boards may use naturally light and dark brown woods, while plastic and vinyl boards often use brown or green for the dark squares and shades such as buff or cream for the light squares. Materials vary widely; while wooden boards are generally used in high-level games; <b>vinyl,</b> <b>plastic,</b> and cardboard are common for low-level and informal play. Decorative glass and marble boards are available but rarely accepted for games rated by national or international chess federations.|$|E
5000|$|MDIs {{were first}} {{developed}} in 1955 by Riker Laboratories, now {{a subsidiary of}} 3M Healthcare. [...] At that time MDIs represented a convergence of two relatively new technologies, the CFC propellant and the Meshburg metering valve which was originally designed for dispensing perfume. The initial design by Riker used a glass canister coated with a <b>vinyl</b> <b>plastic</b> to improve its resilience. [...] By 1956 Riker had developed two MDI based products, the Medihaler-Ept containing epinephrine and the Medihaler-Iso containing Isoprenaline. [...] Both products are agonists which provide short term relief from asthma symptoms and have now largely been replaced in asthma treatment by salbutamol, which is more selective.|$|E
50|$|Women's <b>vinyl</b> (<b>plastic)</b> zōri are formal, {{but less}} formal than fabric, {{sometimes}} brocade covered zōri, {{that are used}} with the most formal of kimono, for example, wedding and funeral wear. Men's zōri are often plastic straw imitation, with foam or cork soles. The hanao, or thongs, for men are often white or black. Women's zōri can also be of straw imitation, but the hanao are usually red, and they rank below colored vinyl or brocade zōri in formality. As formal wear, all plastic and fabric zōri for women {{require the use of}} white tabi socks. Men have more latitude, and can use the same imitation zōri with both informal (without tabi) and formal wear with tabi socks.|$|E

50|$|Normally rabbit {{vibrators}} {{are made}} out of a jelly-like substance (polyvinyl chloride), silicone (semi-organic polymer), rubber (elastic hydrocarbon polymer) or latex (natural rubber) materials. Silicone vibrators are easier to clean and care for, since this material is not porous, therefore no bacteria or foreign matter is absorbed by the toy. Silicone retains heat and has no odour. Jelly material is porous and cannot be sterilised in boiling water and has a scent of rubber that some find unappealing. In order to escape this smell some producers aromatise the products with more pleasurable scents. Rabbit vibrators made from <b>vinyl,</b> <b>plastic,</b> metal, and elastomer materials can be also found. They are much less porous than jelly, or entirely non-porous, but the texture is smooth and firm.|$|E
50|$|PolyOne {{was formed}} on August 31, 2000 from the {{consolidation}} of The Geon Company (Geon) and M.A. Hanna Company (Hanna). The merger between M.A. Hanna Company and The Geon Company in 2000 produced PolyOne Corporation, a Fortune 1000 company. Geon’s roots date back to 1927 when BFGoodrich scientist Waldo Semon produced the first usable vinyl polymer. In 1948, BFGoodrich created a <b>vinyl</b> <b>plastic</b> division that was subsequently spun off through a public offering in 1993, creating Geon, a separate publicly held company. Hanna was formed in 1885 as a privately held company and became publicly held in 1927. In the mid-1980s, Hanna began to divest its historic mining and shipping businesses to focus on polymers. Hanna purchased its first polymer company in 1986 and completed its 26th polymer company acquisition in 2000.|$|E
5000|$|The Dictabelt, {{in early}} years {{and much less}} {{commonly}} also called a Memobelt, is an analog audio recording medium commercially introduced by the American Dictaphone company in 1947. Having been intended for recording dictation and other speech for later transcription, it is a write-once-read-many medium consisting of a [...] thick transparent <b>vinyl</b> <b>plastic</b> belt 3.5 in wide and 12 in around. The belt is loaded onto a pair of metal cylinders, put under tension, then rotated like a tank tread. It is inscribed with an audio-signal-modulated helical groove by a stylus which is slowly moved across the rotating belt. Unlike the stylus of a record cutter, the Dictabelt stylus is blunt and in recording mode it simply impresses a groove into the plastic rather than engraving it and throwing off a thread of waste material.|$|E

He {{designed}} the first thong bathing suit, unisex clothing, the first swimsuit without a built-in bra, the minimalist, soft, transparent No Bra, and the topless monokini. He was a four-time recipient of the Coty American Fashion Critics Award. He produced what is regarded as the first fashion video, Basic Black: William Claxton w/ Peggy Moffitt, in 1966. He had a long, unconventional, and trend-setting career in fashion design.|$|R
50|$|While {{sometimes}} {{confused with}} duct tape, gaffer tape differs {{in the composition}} of both the backing, which is made from fabric as opposed to <b>vinyl</b> or other <b>plastics,</b> and the adhesive, which is more resistant to heat and more easily removed without damaging the surface to which it was adhered.|$|R
