25|$|The {{vacuum system}} for {{evacuating}} a TEM to an operating pressure level consists of several stages. Initially, a low or roughing vacuum is achieved {{with either a}} rotary <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> or diaphragm pumps setting a sufficiently low pressure to allow the operation of a turbo-molecular or diffusion pump establishing high vacuum level necessary for operations. To allow for the low vacuum pump to not require continuous operation, while continually operating the turbo-molecular pumps, the vacuum side of a low-pressure pump may be connected to chambers which accommodate the exhaust gases from the turbo-molecular pump. Sections of the TEM may be isolated {{by the use of}} pressure-limiting apertures to allow for different vacuum levels in specific areas such as a higher vacuum of 10−4 to 10−7 Pa or higher in the electron gun in high-resolution or field-emission TEMs.|$|E

50|$|In a {{hydraulic}} installation, one pump can serve several cylinders and motors. However, {{in that case}} a constant pressure system is required and the system always needs full power. It is more economic to give each cylinder and motor its own pump. In that case, multi-pump assemblies can be used. Gear pumps are often supplied as multi-pumps. The different chambers (sometimes of different sizes) are mounted in one body or built together. <b>Vane</b> <b>pumps</b> and gerotor pumps too are often available as multi-pumps. Screw pumps can be combined with gear or <b>vane</b> <b>pumps.</b> Axial piston swashplate pumps can be combined with a second pump, or {{with one or more}} gear <b>pumps</b> or <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> (the gear or <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> often serving as flush pumps for cooling larger units). Axial plunger pumps of the bent-axis design cannot be combined with other pumps.|$|R

50|$|<b>Vane</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{commonly}} used as high-pressure hydraulic pumps and in automobiles, including supercharging, power-steering and automatic-transmission pumps. Pumps for mid-range pressures include applications such as carbonators for fountain soft-drink dispensers and espresso coffee machines. Furthermore, <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> {{can be used in}} low-pressure gas applications such as secondary air injection for auto exhaust emission control, or in low-pressure chemical vapor deposition systems.|$|R

5000|$|A rotary <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> is a positive-displacement pump that {{consists}} of vanes mounted to a rotor that rotates inside of a cavity. In some cases these vanes can have variable length and/or be tensioned to maintain contact with the walls as the pump rotates. It was invented by Charles C. Barnes of Sackville, New Brunswick, who patented it on June 16, 1874. There have been various improvements, including a variable <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> for gases (1909) ...|$|E

50|$|In {{high vacuum}} applications, {{activated}} alumina {{is used as}} a charge material in fore-line traps to prevent oil generated by rotary <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> from back streaming into the system.|$|R
50|$|The type of pump used varies. Gear pumps {{trochoid}} <b>pumps</b> and <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> are all commonly used. Plunger pumps {{have been}} used in the past, but these are now only used rarely, for small engines.|$|R
50|$|Piston {{pumps are}} more {{expensive}} than gear or <b>vane</b> <b>pumps,</b> but provide longer life operating at higher pressure, with difficult fluids and longer continuous duty cycles. Piston pumps make up one half of a hydrostatic transmission.|$|R
50|$|Examples are <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> parts made of {{polyphenylene}} sulfide (PPS), ceramic insert made of SiNi, watch windows, sapphire LED wafers, bearing rings, vane pumps, gear steel, cutting knives and carbide.|$|E
50|$|Hydristor is a joining of {{the words}} 'hydraulic' and 'transistor'. Thedevice invented by Tom Kasmer in 1996 {{and is based on}} the dual {{pressure}} balanced hydraulic <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> invented by Harry F. Vickers in 1925.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of the <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> is that the design readily lends itself to become a variable-displacement pump, rather than a fixed-displacement pump such as a spur-gear (X-X) or a gerotor (I-X) pump. The centerline distance from the rotor to the eccentric ring is {{used to determine the}} pump's displacement. By allowing the eccentric ring to pivot or translate relative to the rotor, the displacement can be varied. It is even possible for a <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> to pump in reverse if the eccentric ring moves far enough. However, performance cannot be optimized to pump in both directions. This can make for a very interesting hydraulic-control oil pump.|$|E
5000|$|Rotary <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> - {{similar to}} scroll compressors, these have a {{cylindrical}} rotor {{encased in a}} similarly shaped housing. As the rotor orbits, the vanes trap fluid between the rotor and the casing, drawing the fluid through the pump.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are several}} types of pump mechanisms. Piston pumps draw a piston through a {{cylinder}} to create suction. These are generally considered top-of-the-line units. They have characteristics of low speed, high reliability, low noise, and long life. [...] Rotary <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> use a cam with retractable vanes to create suction. These rotary <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> are not widely used anymore. Fast diaphragm pumps use a diaphragm that is acted on by a lever, with thousands of cycles per minute. They operate at higher speed and are usually noisier. Slow diaphragm pumps use a large diaphragm operated by a cam or lever to generate suction with each stroke. [...] Pumps have also been designed that use venturi effects powered by a faucet or water stream, wall suction in hospitals, or pumps powered by oral suctioning.|$|R

50|$|They {{generally}} use a low-volume sliding <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> or {{a liquid}} ring pump to create a negative air pressure. The use of diaphragm mud pumps is less common, but with {{the advantage of a}} simpler design and usually lower overall costs. The disadvantage is that mechanical parts come into contact with the sludge, which is not the case for the more common vacuum pumps.|$|E
50|$|The vacuum {{is created}} and {{maintained}} {{by a series}} of pumps. The first stage is usually based on a roughing pump, most commonly a standard rotary <b>vane</b> <b>pump.</b> This removes most of the gas and typically reaches a pressure of around 133 Pa. Later stages have their vacuum generated by more powerful vacuum systems, most often turbomolecular pumps. Older instruments may have used oil diffusion pumps for high vacuum regions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{combined}} numerical-experimental methodology {{for the analysis}} of the lubrication regime and wear that occur between vanes and pressure ring in variable displacement <b>vane</b> <b>pumps.</b> The knowledge of the lubrication regime is essential for the improvement of the performance of high pressure <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> by reducing wear, increasing the volumetric efficiency and decreasing maintenance costs. Tests using pressure rings of different materials were carried out in order to identify the best material in terms of wear and friction. The proposed methodology is based on Archard’s law and takes advantage of wear experimental measurements, an empirical model for the estimation of contact pressure forces and hardness standard tests. The results of the analysis state that low wear and reduced friction can be obtained if elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication between vanes and pressure ring is established. Results have been also verified by analytical elasto-hydrodynamic models...|$|R

50|$|The most {{prevalent}} outgassing product in vacuum systems is water absorbed by chamber materials. It {{can be reduced}} by desiccating or baking the chamber, and removing absorbent materials.

50|$|They are {{typically}} {{used as a}} vacuum pump, but {{can also be used}} as a gas compressor.The function of a liquid-ring pump is similar to a rotary <b>vane</b> <b>pump,</b> with the difference being that the vanes {{are an integral part of}} the rotor and churn a rotating ring of liquid to form the compression-chamber seal.
