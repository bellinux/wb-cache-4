30|$|The {{effect size}} of both <b>VAR</b> and <b>RANGE</b> for {{few of the}} traits (leaf size and seed mass) were {{significantly}} correlated with {{the proportion of the}} abundance of deciduous and evergreen tree species (Additional file 1 : Table S 14 and Figure S 8). The communities dominated by deciduous species had lower negative <b>VAR</b> and <b>RANGE,</b> whereas communities dominated by evergreen tree species had higher and positive <b>VAR</b> and <b>RANGE</b> (Additional file 1 : Table S 14 and Figure S 8). Although we predicted that if niche differentiation processes such as competition determine the assembly of species in wet and dry forests, the traits should be more evenly distributed and should have smaller kurtosis values than null model expectation, we did not find evidence for this prediction in any of the five functional traits. The contrasting pattern of functional trait metrics among tree communities in different forest types suggests that the distribution and dominance of tree species with contrasting leaf phenology (deciduous and evergreen) in these habitats is strongly determined by habitat filtering.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a new {{measurement}} of risk, Value-at-Risk (VaR) for LQ- 45 index in Indonesian Stock Exchange (ISX). Basic finance uses standard deviation in measuring and quantifying the risks. This paper uses VaR as a risk measure by using historical and analytical methods. This study uses the data containing all LQ- 45 weekly data from January 1 st, 2005 to December, 31 st 2010. Moreover, this paper also calculates VaR of three indices (IHSG, Dow Jones, and S&P 500) for benchmarking purpose. This study finds that LQ- 45 companies have <b>VaR</b> <b>ranging</b> from- 5. 30 to- 41. 05 percent with 95 percent level of confidence. It means that {{we can expect to}} suffer a minimum weekly loss between 5. 30 to 41. 05 percent in 5 percent probability when we invest in the LQ- 45 companies stocks individually. Furthermore, this study finds that individual LQ- 45 stock is riskier than indices based on VaR measure. This paper also concludes that individual LQ- 45 stock tends not to follow normal distribution while index tends to follow by comparing their historical and analytical VaR calculation...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{standards}} impose {{limits on}} the allowable feeder voltage variation in a distributed generation environment. These stipulations must be respected by the distributed power generators (suppliers), which put a cap on the penetration level. A possible solution is to provide reactive power support to improve the voltage profile. This paper proposes a novel scheme, where an auxiliary circuit (comprising an inverter and reactive power bank, RPB), {{in conjunction with a}} PV-grid system, increases the system's reactive power compensation capacity up to 300 % compared to the original or dedicated VAR capacity of the main PV inverter. In spite of using only the conventional discrete form of capacitor/inductor bank, the entire <b>VAR</b> <b>range</b> can be controlled. This enables the local Photovoltaic Distributed Generation System (PV-DGS) to provide the necessary reactive power support for the mitigation of large voltage variation on the feeder because of reverse power flow, intermittent solar radiation and load variation. This, in turn, supports increased PV penetration into the power system. As an extension of the proposed scheme, any existing conventional reactive power banks may be retrofitted with a given PV grid system to realize the proposed functionality. Detailed modeling, analysis and control design are included along with experimental verification...|$|R
