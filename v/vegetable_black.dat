50|$|One {{thing for}} which East Town became {{particularly}} well known was {{the production of}} tarpaulins to cover goods wagons which were used at stations across the country. These were originally made of canvas and treated with linseed oil and <b>vegetable</b> <b>black</b> to weather-proof them. As the work was initially done by hand, those employed to make them were usually sailmakers by trade, with mechanisation not introduced until 1915. At the end of 1914, a new Tarpaulin Shop was commissioned, {{but it did not}} last long, being destroyed by fire in January 1915. In 1928, a dedicated tarpaulin factory was opened and, with the transfer of staff from the Newmarket Workshops, production increased to the rate of 50 tarpaulins per week. The Tarpaulin Manufacturing Shop was razed by fire on 5 August 1954, requiring an increase in the output of the Addington Workshops until the destroyed facility at East Town was replaced mid-1955. Just two months later, on 18 October, the Tarpaulin Depot Repair Shop was similarly destroyed. In 1973, NZR switched to using PVC tarpaulins which were cheaper to make and easier to repair.|$|E
50|$|The {{most notable}} driers are litharge, sugar of lead, patent driers, sulfate of zinc and {{manganese}} dioxide. Liquid driers, such as terebene, {{are also in}} use. Litharge, an oxide of lead, is in most general use. Sugar of lead is used, ground in oil, for light tints. Sulfate of zinc and manganese driers are used for paints in which zinc white is the base, which would be injured by lead driers. Pigments are preparations of metallic, earthy or animal origin mixed into paint to give it color. For oil paint they are usually ground in oil; for distemper they are sold as a finely ground powder. The ordinary pigments are white lead, zinc white, umbers, siennas, ochres, chromes, Venetian red, Indian red, lampblack, bone black, <b>vegetable</b> <b>black,</b> ultramarine, Prussian blue, vermilion, red lead, oxide of iron, lakes and Vandyke brown. The term enamel paint was first given to a compound of zinc white, petrol and resin, which possessed on drying a hard glossy surface. The name is now applied to any colored paint of this nature. Quick-drying enamels are spirit varnishes ground with the desired pigment. For slow-drying enamels oil varnishes form the vehicle.|$|E
40|$|The wall {{paintings}} of the crypt {{of the church of}} Saint Andrew in Viterbo (Italy) date back to the 13 th century. The bad state of preservation and the lack of many areas of the scenes make difficult a clear interpretation of the paintings and therefore a precise historical placing inside the 13 th century. Besides an extensive analysis of the execution techniques and of the constitutive materials has never been undertaken. So the aim of this research has been to characterize the constitutive materials and the execution techniques of the wall paintings in order to provide a valid aid to the historical and artistic interpretation of the iconography and to evaluate the state of preservation of the paintings related to the environment. The wall paintings have been studied by means of non invasive methodologies of analysis and through laboratory techniques. The in situ investigations have been carried out by ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence and false colour infrared (IRC) photography, reflectance spectrophotometry, video microscope acquisitions, XRF spectrometry. These preliminary investigations have been useful to chose the sampling points for the laboratory analysis. The micro samples were examined through FTIR spectrometry and polarizing microscope observation of the pigment powders and of the cross sections. The pigments employed for the wall paintings are: red and yellow ochre, calcium carbonate white, lead based pigments probable red lead, green earth, <b>vegetable</b> <b>black.</b> They have been applied by a lime technique. The photographic campaign and the technical examination of the wall paintings also put in evidence the presence of surface damages. In particular, the abundant superficial salt deposits are the result of the use of unsuitable restorations materials in previous interventions. The environmental conditions (temperature and relative humidity) were registered by means of a digital data logger. During the months of October, November, and December 2009 the RH% values exhibit high average values, from 71 to 83 %. The lowest RH% value (43 %) has been registered on the fifteen of October, the highest one (86 %) has been measured on the thirty-one of December. We believe that this study to be necessary for the future preservation and conservation of these interesting medieval wall paintings...|$|E

40|$|Anthocyanins, the {{naturally}} occurring pigments {{responsible for most}} red to blue colours of flowers, fruits and vegetables, have also attracted interest because of their potential health effects. With the aim of contributing to major insights into their structure–activity relationship (SAR), we have evaluated the radical scavenging and biological activities of selected purified anthocyanin samples (PASs) from various anthocyanin-rich plant materials: two fruits (mahaleb cherry and blackcurrant) and two <b>vegetables</b> (<b>black</b> carrot and “Sun Black” tomato), differing in anthocyanin content (ranging from 4. 9 to 38. 5 mg/g DW) and molecular structure of the predominant anthocyanins. PASs from the abovementioned plant materials have been evaluated for their antioxidant capacity using Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assays. In human endothelial cells, we analysed the anti-inflammatory activity of different PASs by measuring their effects on the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules VCAM- 1 and ICAM- 1. We demonstrated that all the different PASs showed biological activity. They exhibited antioxidant capacity of different magnitude, higher for samples containing non-acylated anthocyanins (typical for fruits) compared to samples containing more complex anthocyanins acylated with cinnamic acid derivatives (typical for vegetables), even though this order was slightly reversed when ORAC assay values were expressed on a molar basis. Concordantly, PASs containing non-acylated anthocyanins reduced the expression of endothelial inflammatory antigens more than samples with aromatic acylated anthocyanins, suggesting the potential beneficial effect of structurally diverse anthocyanins in cardiovascular protection...|$|R

Several {{studies suggest that}} cruciferous vegetable consumption may reduce cancer risk and slow the aging process. To investigate the effect of ITCs on cellular DNA damage, we evaluated the effects of two different ITCs [sulforaphane (SFN) and raphasatin (RPS) ] on the biology of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which, {{in addition to their}} ability to differentiate into mesenchymal tissues, contribute to the homeostatic maintenance of many organs. The choice of SFN and RPS relies on two considerations: they are among the most popular cruciferous vegetables in the diet of western and eastern countries, respectively, and their bioactive properties may differ since they possess specific molecular moiety. Our investigation evidenced that MSCs incubated with low doses of SFN and RPS show reduced in vitro oxidative stress. Moreover, these cells are protected from oxidative damages induced by hydrogen peroxide, while no protection was evident following treatment with the UV ray of a double strand DNA damaging drug, such as doxorubicin. High concentrations of both ITCs induced cytotoxic effects in MSC cultures and further increased DNA damage induced by peroxides. In summary, our study suggests that ITCs, at low doses, may contribute to slowing the aging process related to oxidative DNA damage. Moreover, in cancer treatment, low doses of ITCs may be used as an adjuvant to reduce chemotherapy-induced oxidative stress, while high doses may synergize with anticancer drugs to promote cell DNA damage...|$|R

It faced the south, but was shaded during part of the day by trees. It had been formed at least a century ago by a great accumulation of small and large fragments of sandstone, together with some sandy earth, rammed down level. It is probable that it was at first protected by being covered with turf. This terrace, judging from the number of castings on it, was rather unfavourable for the existence of worms, in comparison with the neighbouring fields and an upper terrace. It was indeed surprising that as many worms could live here as were seen; for on digging a hole in this terrace, the <b>black</b> <b>vegetable</b> mould together with the turf was only four inches in thickness, beneath which lay the level surface of light-coloured sandy soil, with many fragments of sandstone. Before any castings were collected all the previously existing ones were carefully removed. The last day's collection was on October 14th, 1871. The castings were then well dried before a fire; and they weighed exactly 3.5 lbs. This would give for an acre of similar land 7.56 tons of dry earth annually ejected by worms.|$|R
