50|$|Scholars {{and museum}} {{professionals}} have done significant work exploring the different interpretation styles, how the museum presents and explains {{the role of}} the costumed historian, and how the interaction between visitor and costumed interpreter impacts the <b>visitor’s</b> <b>overall</b> museum experience. Jay Anderson, in his 1984 book, Time Machines: The World of Living History, defines living history as an “attempt by people to simulate life in another time” and stresses its importance within American culture. He argues that living history museums function as powerful “time machines” that transport visitors both mentally and emotionally into the past for a unique learning experience. Anderson divides the recreated historical experience enacted at living history museums into three categories based on their purpose and outcome: educational for museum purposes, research for archaeological inquiries, and recreation for entertainment.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a series}} of anxieties about mixing at the Jewish Lads’ Brigade and Club (JLB & C) in Manchester, UK during the 1950 s and 1960 s, primarily focused on inter-faith activities, relationships and marriages. This paper explores how a powerful moral geography of gender and religion came to be shaped, regulated and negotiated at this youth work space. The concerns expressed by some adults over teenage encounters in the post-war city were articulated and understood through the notion of ‘atmospheres’, and this paper suggests how this idea and language captured some of the anxieties and emotions surrounding cultures of leisure at this time. This paper contributes an in-depth and sustained focus on the moral geographies of the post-war city in relation to young people, as well as addressing an important gap in scholarship on Jewish youthful religiosities. Furthermore, it pushes at ideas about meaningful encounters through the consideration of the JLB & C as a meeting space and arena for <b>visitors.</b> <b>Overall,</b> the paper examines how the JLB & C acted as both a mirror to the wider social changes of the post-war era, while also being an active contributor in shaping those same processes of social change...|$|E

Governments increasingly include these activities into their development and tourism strategies. Notably, there are benefits and costs to hosting sport mega-events. The 2010 FIFA World Cup presents South Africa with tangible and intangible benefits. Communities {{are one of the}} most important stakeholders of events. Research investigating residents’ perceptions on impacts of mega-events, especially those residing closest to the event location are limited. This study examined Green Point residents’ perceptions of the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the impacts of the Green Point Stadium. The aim was to investigate the level of awareness, perceptions and attitudes of residents’ living within one kilometre of the Stadium using a spatially based stratified random sampling method. Interviewer completed questionnaires were administered and 344 responses from residents recorded. Findings reveal that residents have high levels of awareness about the event but more could be done to improve communication and the dissemination of information by stakeholders. Although, the stadium location was initially contested, the majority of residents favour the chosen site. Residents’ primary concern about South Africa hosting the event relate to crime, safety and security of <b>visitors.</b> <b>Overall,</b> residents have high expectations’ regarding social and economic impacts. Moreover, residents have positive attitudes towards the country hosting the mega-event and most believe that lasting legacies will be left for the nation.

40|$|Bullying {{has been}} an issue in schools and became a major concern for school leaders {{over the past two}} decades. Olweus (1993) defined three {{characteristics}} of bullying behavior: intent to harm another, repeated offenses, and a perceived or real power imbalance. This study examined the law 2 ̆ 7 s provisions concerning bullying in schools; specifically examining the Florida Jeffrey Johnston Stand Up for All Student Act (2008), and the required policy implemented in Hillsborough County Public Schools (HCPS). Discourse theory framed the study, as defined by Habermas (1996) and the derivative Interpretive Policy Analysis was used to analyze the district policy, as defined by Yanow (2000). The study utilized four research questions to examine bullying law and policy: what constitutional, statutory, and case law said about bullying; bullying policies in literature; development of bullying policy and how closely it matched law. Constitutional law laid the foundation of the school system. Statutory law provided more details and at the state level, defined requirements concerning bullying. Bullying laws existed in 44 states, the majority addressing one or more of Olweus 2 ̆ 7 components. HCPS developed its xii bullying policy in the fall, 2008, closely following requirements of Florida bullying law. The district had a student conduct policy prior to new requirements and a violence prevention committee (VPC) met monthly. The VPC formed a smaller committee including administrators, teachers, parents, students, and law enforcement members, to develop the policy. The committee examined each component of the state model policy, and either used the item verbatim or added additional information specific to HCPS. The district exceeded state requirements for some items such as extending the definition of bullying to include employees and <b>visitors.</b> <b>Overall,</b> bullying laws were designed to protect students from harmful behaviors. The district policy was designed to achieve this task; however, it was also seen as a means to avoid lawsuits and to protect the district 2 ̆ 7 s interests. Implications included the need to update laws/policies continually to reflect the current times, such as new technologies, and the interpretation of laws and eventual implementation in schools. In addition, the interpretive policy analysis process used in this study could be applied to other studies examining the policy development process...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{analysis}} {{of population growth}} and components of demographic growth in five most important spa settlements in Serbia: Vrnjacka banja, Niska banj, Banja Koviljaca. As indices of demographic development, we have analyzed: natural and mechanical movement of population, age and sex, activity and sex, households and apartments in spa places. The finding is that demographic development of spa places in Serbia has been politically influenced. Due to dismantling state territory of former Yugoslavia, the choice of domestic tourist destination for Serbian population became smaller. Because of that, spas became more important tourist destination which fostered demographic growth of those places. The data analysis demonstrated that during the last six decades, population in all spa places increased with higher insensitive compare {{with the rest of}} Serbia. This is the result of high inmigration, particularly in the last decade, when the share of this movement was over 90 %. The pacing of population ageing in spa places, did not follow ageing of total population in Serbia. Average age in Serbia between 1961 - 2002. increased for 31. 8 %, while in spas population ageing was more intensify with 36. 4 % increase. The number of household showed constant increase from census to census, as well as in Serbia as in each of spa places with no exception. Average size of household in spas in 1948. was smaller than the average in Serbia for almost one member. By the year 2002. the average sizes of households in spas and in Serbia was almost equalized. Spa places suffered sortage of apartments in 1948. By the year 2002. the evidence showed considerable surplus which as the biggest in Vrnjacka Banja spa. The amount of surplus was 15 %, which is higher than the average in Serbia. The purpose of this surplus is rent and accommodation of spa <b>visitors.</b> <b>Overall</b> results point out that despite of population decrease of Serbia, spa places enjoy more and more permanent residents. Among the reasons economic stability of spa places (in the areas of services and medical care) should be emphasized, which triggered inmigration increase, outmigration decrease, and slower rate of ageing (despite of small rate of natural increase) ...|$|E
40|$|The Ozark National Scenic Riverways (ONSR) {{has seen}} {{a wide range of}} recreationists since its {{establishment}} in 1964. To better understand these recreationists, Experience Use History (EUH) has been identified as a measure of exposure to ONSR. EUH is a construct used to identify how often a visitor frequents an area, as well as his or her history with that area. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the changes in river user demographics over the past 24 years and how these changes relate to EUH using time series analyses. Study field methods follow procedures of Rapid Assessment Visitor Inventory (RAVI), which has been periodically conducted at ONSR since 1972. This study utilizes questionnaires for which raw data were available, collected from 1986 through 2010 to conduct time series analyses of visitor demographics and EUH. EUH groupings were created using the methods of Smith et al. (2009), resulting in the identification of Casual Newcomers, Casual Veterans, Occasional, and Frequent visitors. While a wealth of information exists pertaining to EUH and general demographics, there is an absence of studies analyzing the dynamic relationship of these variables over time. This research examines for the first time if EUH classifications are also time-dependent or if they are functionally stable at a quarter-century time scale. EUH trends over time showed that Casual Newcomers have begun to transition into Casual Veterans throughout the riverways as their history and frequency of visits increased over the years. Changes in age, watercraft type, and gender were also detected resulting in an aging visitor group to ONSR, an increase in motorboat use, and a slow increase in the proportion of female visitors. Experiences, preferences, and attitudes were also analyzed in terms of both EUH and river district. Finally, average distance traveled by visitors was also analyzed showing ONSR to be a regional attraction attended by both urban and nonurban <b>visitors.</b> <b>Overall</b> this study suggests that visitor populations to ONSR are dynamic. Some of the most important findings of this study showed that EUH category for a given visitor can and does change over time. The Casual Newcomers and Casual Veterans had clear trends; all three river districts showed distinct trends of increasing Casual Veterans and decreasing Casual Newcomers over time but at varying rates of change in proportion. This finding coupled with the aging of visitors to ONSR, suggests that visitors are returning to the riverways and, over time, increasing in experience, thus transforming the Casual Newcomers into Casual Veterans...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Past research in zoos has focused on characteristics and motivations of visitors, as well as the orientation, and layout of zoos. However, research to date does not address whether customers are satisfied. To remain financially sustainable and maintain a viable customer base, zoos must provide quality services and experiences and satisfy customer wants. The concept of service quality has frequently been utilized by businesses as a means of approximating the quality of experience and satisfaction levels of customers. Service quality has recently been utilized by the recreation and tourism industry. However, there is confusion regarding the relationship between the constructs of service quality and visitor satisfaction. Past zoological research has not examined the role of service quality and its relationship to visitor satisfaction and future behavioral intentions of visitors. Data collected from visitors to the Fort Worth Zoo were used to test these relationships. Twenty-eight service quality attributes were identified within the zoo, and visitors were asked to rate their expectations of performance, their relative importance, and their perceptions of the performance for the attributes. Visitors also rated their overall level of satisfaction, overall impression of service quality, and their future behavioral intentions. Results identified those service quality attributes and aspects of the zoo which visitors felt were most important to them, and which attributes performed the highest. Based on the discrepancy scores between performance and expectations, attributes were identified and categorized for managerial implications. Results also identified the key determining service quality domains that contribute to <b>overall</b> <b>visitor</b> satisfaction, <b>overall</b> service quality, and positive future behavioral intentions.

40|$|Tourism {{has long}} been {{recognised}} as a vital element of the economic development and growth of island destinations. This has been no different for the island of Mauritius, whose appeal is predominantly based on a sun, sand and sea product anchored in resort-based experiences. At the maturity stage of its destination life cycle, the island has embarked on product development and market diversification strategies for growth. In this respect, this study investigates cultural differences in image perceptions for the key generating markets of Mauritius and the factors determining repeat visitation. The relationship among several constructs such as destination image, service interactions, place attachment, personal involvement, satisfaction and future behaviour is explored. Understanding these relationships, can possibly improve segmentation, targeting, product development strategies and revisit intentions. Also, the role of interactions by visitors with hotel employees and how these influence other constructs such as place attachment and personal involvement have been of lesser interest to researchers. Therefore, a literature review on these relationships informs {{the construction of a}} theoretical model. Adopting a post-positivist stance, the qualitative component of the research focuses on exploring visitors‟ perceptions of image and service interactions using social constructionism. Personal construct theory informed the choice of a convenience sample of 103 visitors. Broad questions were designed within a phenomenological approach to allow participants to narrate their lived‟ experiences. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data and supplemented by content analysis using CATPAC to improve credibility of interpretation. The findings revealed that images are linked to motives for choice {{and in the case of}} Mauritius, fulfilment of needs for relaxation and escape as well as socialisation and learning determine visitors‟ perceptions. Service interactions are imbued in values such as integrity and respect, mutual understanding and authenticity of display. Place attachment as a latent dimension was related to the affective image of the place while personal involvement and familiarity influenced perceptions of service interactions. Nationality, ethnicity and language spoken had some influence on perceptions. These findings informed the design of a survey instrument that was administered to a quota sample of 1000 visitors, of which, 705 were useable. The method of data collection iii was self- completion by hotel guests and self-completion in the presence of the researcher on beaches around hotels. Exploratory factor analysis was initially used to assess the dimensionality of the various constructs in the theoretical model, thereafter confirmatory factor analysis and structural equations modelling were undertaken to validate the model. Cluster analysis was used to identify different segments of visitors based on their level of personal involvement and place attachment. Regression models were developed to predict <b>visitors</b> <b>overall</b> image, satisfaction and loyalty as well as their propensity to be repeaters. The results indicated that destination image has both direct and an indirect influence over future behaviour. In particular, personal involvement and perceived service interactions are antecedents of destination image, while place attachment has motives for choice and personal involvement as antecedents. Given these relationships, important implications for destination image, product development as well as direction for destination marketing are offered. Implications for service providers are discussed and theoretical contributions of the study are highlighted...|$|E
