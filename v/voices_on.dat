25|$|The show's {{unprecedented}} {{access to}} police departments has generated some controversy because such access is not typically given to traditional local news media.

25|$|Cardinal Galeazzo Marescotti {{watched over}} his beloved nephew and {{was pleased with}} the {{brilliant}} life, but more so with the great culture, munificence, and devotion to God of Francesco Maria. The cardinal had a precise plan: to persuade the pope to elevate the title of the fiefdom of Cerveteri from marquis to prince. Other Roman noble families such as the Aldobrandini, Boncompagni, Borghese and Erba-Odescalchi were made princes by their respective popes. The Ruspolis did not have a pope and it was necessary to make a munificent gesture and to acquire particular merits with the Holy See. In 1707 the cardinal persuaded his nephew to arm a brig to donate to the Holy See. The modern hull with wide sails was delivered in Civitavecchia. Handel had composed for the occasion a choral of white <b>voices</b> <b>on</b> a text greeting the pope king. But that was not enough to elevate Cerveteri to a principality.|$|E
