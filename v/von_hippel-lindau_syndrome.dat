The former are well recognised with {{multiple endocrine neoplasia}} (MEN) type 2 and <b>von</b> <b>Hippel-Lindau</b> <b>syndromes.</b> A few cases are associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. The familial paraganglioma-phaeochromocytoma syndromes are less well recognised, but as more genetic testing is performed, more cases belonging to this syndrome will be revealed. These syndromes result from mutations {{in one of three}} subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) gene. There are four types: type 1 associated with SDHD, type 2 with an unknown gene, type 3 with SDHC and type 4 with SDHB. There are distinct genotypic-phenotypic correlations with each mutation. Patients with SDHB mutations have a positive family history in 33 % of cases, present with single tumours around 30 years of age and have extra-adrenal paragangliomas mainly in the abdomen and pelvis; 20 % may also have phaeochromocytomas, and tumours in these patients have a great propensity to metastasise. Patients with SDHD and SDHC mutations have a higher positive family history (66 %) and have head and neck paragangliomas.

50|$|Hemangioblastomas (or haemangioblastomas, see {{spelling}} differences) (capilliary hemangioblastomas) are tumors of {{the central}} nervous system that originate from the vascular system usually during middle-age. Sometimes these tumors occur in other sites such as the spinal cord and retina. They may be associated with other diseases such as polycythemia (increased blood cell count), pancreatic cysts and <b>Von</b> <b>Hippel-Lindau</b> <b>syndrome</b> (VHL syndrome).

50|$|<b>Von</b> <b>Hippel-Lindau</b> <b>syndrome</b> (VHL) is a dominantly {{inherited}} hereditary cancer syndrome predisposing to {{a variety}} of malignant and benign tumors of the eye, brain, spinal cord, kidney, pancreas, and adrenal glands. A germline mutation of this gene is the basis of familial inheritance of VHL syndrome. Individuals with VHL syndrome inherit one mutation in the VHL protein that causes the protein's normal function to be lost or altered. Over time, sporadic mutation in the second copy of the VHL protein can lead to carcinomas, in particular hemangioblastomas affecting the liver and kidneys, renal (and vaginal) clear cell adenocarcinomas.|$|E
50|$|The von Hippel-Lindau tumor {{suppressor}} gene generally has a germline mutation. This {{suppressor gene}} is also called elongin binding protein and G7 protein. The VHL protein is involved in up-regulation of hypoxic response via the hypoxia inducible factorHIF-1 alpha. Mutations generally prevent the production of any functional VHL protein or result in a change of structure of VHL protein. This genetic disorder shows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, with about 20% of patients possessing a new mutation. There are usually several other tumors which {{are part of the}} syndrome, including tumors of the central nervous system, kidneys, pancreas, adrenal glands, epididymis, broad ligament, along with the endolymphatic sac. The vast majority of patients with an endolymphatic sac tumor have <b>von</b> <b>Hippel-Lindau</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
40|$|Pheochromocytoma (PCC) and paraganglioma (PGL) {{are rare}} chromaffin cell tumors which secrete catecholamines and {{form part of}} the family of neuroendocrine tumors. Although a rare cause of {{secondary}} hypertension in pediatrics, the presentation of hypertension in these patients is characteristic, and treatment is definitive. The gold standard for diagnosis is via measurement of plasma free metanephrines, with imaging studies performed for localization, identification of metastatic lesions and for surgical resection. Preoperative therapy with alpha-blocking agents, beta blockers, and potentially tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitors aid in a safe pre-, intra- and postoperative course. PCC and PGL are inherited in as much as 80 % of pediatric cases, and all patients with mutations should be followed closely given the risk of recurrence and malignancy. While the presentation of chromaffin cell tumors has been well described with multiple endocrine neoplasia, NF 1, and <b>Von</b> <b>Hippel–Lindau</b> <b>syndromes,</b> the identification of new gene mutations leading to chromaffin cell tumors at a young age is changing the landscape of how clinicians approach such cases. The paraganglioma–pheochromocytoma syndromes (SDHx) comprise familial gene mutations, of which the SDHB gene mutation carries a high rate of malignancy. Since the inheritance rate of such tumors is higher than previously described, genetic screening is recommended in all patients, and lifelong follow-up for recurrent tumors is a must. A multidisciplinary team approach allows for optimal health-care delivery in such children. This review serves to provide an overview of pediatric PCC and PGL, including updates on the preferred methods of imaging, guidelines on gene testing as well as management of hypertension in such patients...|$|R
40|$|Hemangioblastomas {{are rare}} and benign tumors {{accounting}} {{for less than}} 2 % of all central nervous system (CNS) tumors. The vast majority of hemangioblastomas occur sporadically, whereas {{a small number of}} cases, especially in younger patients, are associated with <b>Von</b> <b>Hippel–Lindau</b> (VHL) <b>syndrome.</b> It is thought that loss of tumor suppressor function of the VHL gene results in stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha with downstream activation of cellular proliferative and angiogenic genes that promote tumorigenesis. VHL-related hemangioblastomas predominantly occur in the cerebellum and spine. Lesions are often diagnosed on contrast-enhanced craniospinal MRIs, and the diagnosis of VHL occurs through assessment for germline VHL mutations. Surgical resection remains the primary treatment modality for symptomatic or worrisome lesions, with excellent local control rates and neurological outcomes. Stereotactic radiotherapy can be employed in patients who are deemed high risk for surgery, have multiple lesions, or have non-resectable lesions.

40|$|<b>Von</b> <b>Hippel-Lindau</b> (VHL) <b>syndrome</b> is a {{hereditary}} condition predisposing to {{the development}} of different cancer forms, related to germline inactivation of the homonymous tumor suppressor pVHL. The best characterized function of pVHL is the ubiquitination dependent degradation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) via the proteasome. It is also involved in several cellular pathways acting as a molecular hub and interacting with more than 200 different proteins. Molecular details of pVHL plasticity remain in large part unknown. Here, we present a novel manually curated Petri Net (PN) model of the main pVHL functional pathways. The model was built using functional information derived from the literature. It includes all major pVHL functions and is able to credibly reproduce VHL syndrome at the molecular level. The reliability of the PN model also allowed in silico knockout experiments, driven by previous model analysis.

The most clinically important feature of pheochromocytomas is their tendency to produce large amounts of the catecholamine hormones epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine. This may lead to potentially life-threatening high blood pressure, or cardiac arrythmias, and numerous symptoms such as headache, palpitations, anxiety attacks, sweating, weight loss, and tremor. Diagnosis is most easily confirmed through urinary measurement of catecholamine metabolites such as VMA and metanephrines. Most pheochromocytomas are initially treated with anti-adrenergic drugs to protect against catecholamine overload, with surgery employed to remove the tumor once the patient is medically stable.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. <b>Von</b> <b>Hippel-Lindau</b> (VHL) <b>syndrome</b> is a {{pathological}} condition that causes various clinical symptoms and {{is difficult to}} diagnose. The most common pathological lesions are hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, retinal angiomas, renal clear cell carcinomas, and pheochromocytomas. Case Report. A 23 -year-old female had a syncope episode in 2008. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a right temporal hemangioblastoma, which was treated surgically. Genetic screening identified a VHL gene mutation, and computed tomography (CT) revealed a left adrenal mass. Since {{it was unclear whether}} the mass was a pheochromocytoma, or another benign or malignant tumors, laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed. A month after surgery, the patient complained of general fatigue, poor concentration, loss of appetite, and insomnia. After careful clinical investigation, the patient was referred to a psychiatrist due to suspected depression, which was confirmed. Conclusions. VHL genetic screening should be performed in cases of hemangioblastoma. In VHL syndrome cases, pheochromocytoma cannot always be diagnosed by biochemical catecholamine analyses; therefore, CT or MRI scanning of the abdomen must be performed. Due to the long treatment period, some patients may develop episodes of depression, which can simulate VHL syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{clear cell}} microcystic adenoma of the sinonasal cavity is rare. It has {{previously}} been described only as a VHL-associated tumour. <b>Von</b> <b>Hippel-Lindau</b> (VHL) <b>syndrome</b> is an inherited cancer syndrome characterised by an elevated risk of neoplasia including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), haemangioblastoma, and phaeochromocytoma. We describe the second reported case of a primary clear cell microcystic adenoma of the sinonasal cavity. The 39 -year-old patient with VHL syndrome had previously undergone resection and ablation of ccRCC. He presented with epistaxis. Imaging demonstrated a mass in the ethmoid sinus. Initial clinical suspicion was of metastatic ccRCC. However, tumour morphology and immunoprofile were distinct from the previous ccRCC and supported a diagnosis of primary microcystic adenoma. Analysis of DNA extracted from sinonasal tumour tissue did not show loss of the wild-type allele at the VHL locus. Although this did not support tumour association with VHL disease, {{it was not possible}} to look for a loss-of-function mutation. The association of primary microcystic adenoma of the sinonasal cavity with VHL disease remains speculative. These lesions are benign but are likely to require regular surveillance. Such tumours may require repeated surgical excision...|$|R
40|$|Phaeochromocytomas {{are rare}} neuroendocrine tumours that produce catecholamines and {{numerous}} secretory proteins and peptides, including neuropeptide Y (NPY), a vasoactive peptide with influences on blood pressure. The production of catecholamines and NPY by phaeochromocytomas is highly variable. This study examined influences of hereditary factors {{and differences in}} catecholamine production on tumour expression of NPY, as assessed by quantitative PCR, enzyme immunoassay and immunohistochemistry. Phaeochromocytomas included hereditary adrenaline-producing tumours (adrenergic phenotype) in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), predominantly noradrenaline-producing tumours (noradrenergic phenotype) in <b>von</b> <b>Hippel-Lindau</b> (VHL) <b>syndrome,</b> and other adrenergic and noradrenergic tumours {{where there was no}} clear hereditary syndrome. NPY levels in phaeochromocytomas from VHL patients were lower (P< 0. 0001) than in those from MEN 2 patients for both mRNA (84 -fold difference) and the peptide (99 -fold difference). These findings were supported by immunohistochemistry. NPY levels were also lower in VHL tumours than in those where there was no hereditary syndrome. Relative absence of expression of NPY in phaeochromocytomas from VHL patients when compared with other groups appears to be largely independent of differences in catecholamine production and is consistent with a unique phenotype in VHL syndrome...|$|R

40|$|The <b>von</b> <b>Hippel-Lindau</b> (VHL) <b>syndrome</b> is a pleomorphic {{familial}} disease {{characterized by the}} development of highly vascularized tumors, such as hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, pheochromocytomas, renal cell carcinomas, cysts and neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas. Up to 75 % of VHL patients are affected by VHL-associated pancreatic lesions; however, very few reports in the published literature have described the cellular origins and biological roles of VHL in the pancreas. Since homozygous loss of Vhl in mice resulted in embryonic lethality, this study aimed to characterize the functional significance of VHL in the pancreas by conditionally inactivating Vhl utilizing the Cre/LoxP system. Specifically, Vhl was inactivated in different pancreatic cell populations distinguished by their roles during embryonic organ development and their endocrine lineage commitment. With Cre recombinase expression directed by a glucagon promoter in a-cells or an insulin promoter in b-cells, we showed that deletion of Vhl is dispensable for normal functions of the endocrine pancreas.

40|$|The {{molecular}} pathogenesis of pancreatic endocrine tumors {{is largely}} unknown. Such tumors {{are more likely}} to develop in individuals with the <b>von</b> <b>Hippel-Lindau</b> (VHL) <b>syndrome.</b> We sought to determine whether allelic loss of the recently identified VHL tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 3 p 25 - 26 occurs in the more common sporadic forms of these tumors. Allelic loss on chromosome 3 p was identified in 33 % of 43 patients with endocrine tumors of the pancreas. The smallest common region of allelic loss, however, centered not at the VHL locus, but rather at 3 p 25, centromeric to VHL. Furthermore, no mutations of the VHL gene were identified in these tumors. Loss of alleles on chromosome 3 p was associated with clinically malignant disease, whereas tumors with retained 3 p alleles {{were more likely to be}} benign. Thus, the VHL gene does not appear to play a pathogenic role in the development of sporadic pancreatic endocrine tumors. Instead, a locus at chromosome 3 p 25 may harbor a novel pancreatic endocrine tumor suppressor gene, and allelic loss of this chromosomal region may serve as a molecular marker that helps distinguish benign from clinically malignant disease...|$|R
40|$|The <b>von</b> <b>Hippel-Lindau</b> (pVHL) protein {{plays an}} {{important}} role in hypoxia sensing. It binds to the hydroxylated hypoxia-inducible factor 1 a (HIF- 1 a) and serves as a recognition component of an E 3 -ubiquitin ligase complex. In hypoxia or secondary to a mutated VHL gene, the nondegraded HIF- 1 a forms a heterodimer with HIF-b and leads to increased transcription of hypoxia-inducible genes, including erythropoietin (EPO). The autosomal domi-nant cancer-predisposition <b>von</b> <b>Hippel-Lindau</b> (VHL) <b>syndrome</b> is due to inheritance of a single mutated allele of VHL. In contrast, we recently showed that homozygous germline 598 CrT VHL mutation leads to Chuvash poly-cythemia (CP). We subsequently found VHL mutations in three unrelated individuals unaffected with CP, one of whom was compound heterozygous for the 598 CrT mutation and another VHL mutation. We now report seven additional polycythemic patients with VHL mutations in both alleles. Two Danish siblings and another American boy were homozygous for the VHL 598 CrT mutation. Three unrelated white Americans were compound heter-ozygotes for 598 CrT and another VHL mutation, 562 CrG in two and 574 CrT in the third. Additionally, a Croatian boy was homozygous for a 571 CrG VHL mutation, the first example of homozygous VHL germline mutation causing polycythemia, other than the VHL 598 CrT mutation.
