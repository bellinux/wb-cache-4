Internal NATO reaction to these former Warsaw Pact countries was initially negative, but by the 1991 Rome summit in November, members agreed to a series of goals that could lead to accession, such as market and democratic liberalization, and that NATO should be a partner in these efforts. In subsequent years, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its eastern neighbors were set up, including the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (later the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council) and the Partnership for Peace.|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} study aims {{to quantify}} the determinants of entrepreneurship in the four countries of the <b>Visegrad</b> (V 4) <b>group</b> (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) with a particular focus {{on the relationship between}} entrepreneurship and unemployment. The purpose of the research was to analyze whether, during the periods of higher unemployment rate, individuals more likely engage into entrepreneurial activity. Data were collected from the national statistical offices of the Visegrad countries, World Bank, Eurostat and Heritage Foundation. The collected sample covered years 1998 - 2015. To achieve the main objective of the article, regression models with the dependent variable, the rate of registered businesses per economically active inhabitant, were quantified. Estimated regressions proved a positive relationship between entrepreneurship and unemployment. A higher unemployment rate was associated with the increase in overall entrepreneurial activity. Estimated models further confirmed the negative influence of the administrative barriers on the overall entrepreneurial activity. Several policy and research implications are discussed in the study...|$|R

25|$|The EU Commission {{decided on}} 11 March {{to enter into}} a full free-trade {{agreement}} with Ukraine within the year. On 12 March, the European Parliament rejected the upcoming referendum on independence in Crimea, which they saw as manipulated and contrary to international and Ukrainian law. The G7 bloc of developed nations (the G8 minus Russia) made a joint statement condemning Russia and announced that they would suspend preparations for the planned G8 summit in Sochi in June. NATO condemned Russia's military escalation in Crimea and stated that it was breach of international law while the Council of Europe expressed its full support for the territorial integrity and national unity of Ukraine. The <b>Visegrád</b> <b>Group</b> has issued a joint statement urging Russia to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and for Ukraine to take into account its minority groups to not further break fragile relations. It has urged for Russia to respect Ukrainian and international law and in line with the provisions of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum.|$|E
25|$|Most visibly, {{there were}} {{numerous}} improvements in human rights, such as freedom of speech, internet freedom (no censorship), civil liberties (1st class) and political rights (1st class), as ranked by Freedom House non-governmental organization. In 1991, Poland {{became a member of}} the <b>Visegrád</b> <b>Group</b> and joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance in 1999 along with the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Poles then voted to join the European Union in a referendum in June 2003, with Poland becoming a full member on 1 May 2004. Poland joined the Schengen Area in 2007, as a result of which, the country's borders with other member states of the European Union have been dismantled, allowing for full freedom of movement within most of the EU. In contrast to this, a section of Poland's eastern border now comprises the external EU border with Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. That border has become increasingly well protected, and has led in part to the coining of the phrase 'Fortress Europe', in reference to the seeming 'impossibility' of gaining entry to the EU for citizens of the former Soviet Union.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Among the {{periodic}} system's elements, mercury (Hg) is most liable to dispersion and, simultaneously, most liable to secondary enrichment. Consequently, mercury enrichments can {{occur as a}} result of a number of geologic as well as anthropogenic processes. If the geologic processes cease, quite extended dispersion halos can form around a former accumulation center. Hydrothermal mineralization is a typical process giving rise to mercury concentration. As a result, regional mercury impacts can occur in the floodplains of rivers flowing from the mining and heavy industrial regions of Transylvania and Slovakia. Elsewhere, mercury anomalies detectable at the intermediate scale (1 : 50, 000) can be found in the Zemplén and Mátra Mountains and, subordinately, in the Börzsöny Mountains. Typically mercury anomalies develop above major structural lineaments as well, unless they are buried under thick young sediments. A remarkable example is the deep fault separating the Pilis and <b>Visegrád</b> Mountains. Another <b>group</b> of Hg anomalies is caused by well-known mercury contamination sources (Kazincbarcika, Balatonfűzfő), which are truly local: they cannot be detected at the scale of the given study. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{accession}} of {{the group}} of eight post-communist Central and Eastern European member states who joined in 2004 marked a historic watershed {{in the development of the}} European Union. The subsequent enlargements in 2004 represented the biggest expansion of the EU’s membership base since the beginning of the institutionalised process of institutional European integration after the end of WW 2. Even more importantly however, it constituted the official end of more than four decades in which the European continent had been artificially divided into two ideological and military blocs by the Cold War. This article concentrates on the 2004 enlargement and analyses how the CEE- 8 group has integrated into the EU’s institutional and policy acquis over the past decade. In this respect the impact of the global financial crisis of 2008 – 09 represents a major challenge for the countries of the region in their ongoing political, economic and social transformation since the fall of communism. The paper examines to what extent the CEE countries have managed to tackle the multiple challenges of the post-communist transition and which factors have determined their status as predominantly passive policy-takers. Special emphasis is put on the impact of the 2008 – 09 global financial crisis, which poses the risk of backsliding the CEE’s domestic political and economic transition process and growing alienation from the increasingly complex new coordinative EU policy mechanisms. The article also considers the potential future role of the semi-institutionalised cooperation amongst the <b>Visegrád</b> 4 <b>group</b> (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) in effectively promoting the interests of the wider CEE region in the EU. The main challenge in this respect lies in the persistent diversity of national interests and varying levels of commitment towards transnational cooperation amongst the V 4 and the wider CEE group. This especially applies to the regional leader Poland, which has been torn between the ambition to intensify regional cooperation and the desire to become a leading player in the EU alongside France and Germany...|$|R
