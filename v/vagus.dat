5|$|Loss of {{function}} of the <b>vagus</b> nerve (X) {{will lead to a}} loss of parasympathetic innervation to {{a very large number of}} structures. Major effects of damage to the <b>vagus</b> nerve may include a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Isolated dysfunction of only the <b>vagus</b> nerve is rare, but can be diagnosed by a hoarse voice, due to dysfunction of one of its branches, the recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the <b>vagus</b> nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The <b>vagus</b> nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying {{the muscles of}} the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the <b>vagus</b> nerve to supply the muscles. The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The <b>vagus</b> nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the <b>vagus</b> nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the <b>vagus</b> nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{receives}} nerve {{signals from}} the <b>vagus</b> nerve and from nerves arising from the sympathetic trunk. These nerves act to influence, but not control, the heart rate. Sympathetic nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The <b>vagus</b> nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease the heart rate, and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase the heart rate. These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus.|$|E

5|$|The somatic motor fibers that {{innervate}} the laryngeal and pharyngeal {{muscles are}} located in the nucleus ambiguus and emerge from the medulla in the cranial root of the accessory nerve. Fibers cross over to and join the <b>vagus</b> nerve in the jugular foramen. Sensory cell bodies {{are located in}} the inferior jugular ganglion, and the fibers terminate in the solitary nucleus. Parasympathetic fibers to segments of the trachea and esophagus in the neck originate in the dorsal nucleus of the <b>vagus</b> nerve.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vagus</b> nerve (X) {{provides}} sensory and autonomic (parasympathetic) motor innervation to {{structures in}} the neck and also {{to most of the}} organs in the chest and abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} {{are influenced by the}} vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the <b>vagus</b> nerve. Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the <b>vagus</b> nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|E

5|$|Neurostimulation may {{be another}} option in {{those who are not}} {{candidates}} for surgery. Three types {{have been shown to be}} effective in those who do not respond to medications: <b>vagus</b> nerve stimulation, anterior thalamic stimulation, and closed-loop responsive stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Taste is {{generated}} from receptors {{on the tongue}} and passed along the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves into the solitary tract in the brainstem. Some taste information is also passed from the pharynx into this area via the <b>vagus</b> nerve. Information is then passed from here through the thalamus into the gustatory cortex.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vagus</b> nerves, {{from which}} the {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves branch, exit the skull at the jugular foramen and travel within the carotid sheath alongside the carotid arteries through the neck. The recurrent laryngeal nerves branch off the <b>vagus,</b> the left at the aortic arch, and the right at the right subclavian artery. The left RLN passes {{in front of the}} arch, and then wraps underneath and behind it. After branching, the nerves typically ascend in a groove at the junction of the trachea and esophagus. They then pass behind the posterior, middle part of the outer lobes of the thyroid gland and enter the larynx underneath the inferior constrictor muscle, passing into the larynx just posterior to the cricothyroid joint. The terminal branch is called the inferior laryngeal nerve.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effects of aortic depressor nerve (ADN) transection, supranodosal <b>vagi</b> denervation (NG <b>vagi</b> cut) and adrenergic receptor blocker treatment on the cardiovascular responses evoked by systemic injection of bombesin. The cardiovascular effects were studied in spontaneously breathing rats that were (i) bilaterally, midcervically vagotomized (MC <b>vagi</b> cut) and subjected to section of the aortic depressor nerves, (ii) midcervically vagotomized and subsequently vagotomized at the supranodosal level or (iii) midcervically vagotomized before and after pharmacological blockade of �- or �-adrenergic receptors with phentolamine and propranolol, respectively. An intravenous bolus of bombesin (10 µg/kg) in midcervically vagotomized and ADN denervated animals increased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). An approximate 20 % increase in blood pressure occurred immediately following bombesin injection and lasted for 2 – 3 min. Augmentation of the heart rate occurred 30 – 60 s after the bombesin challenge and persisted for more than 10 min. After section of the supranodosal <b>vagi,</b> bombesin failed to induce an increase in heart rate. Blockade of �-adrenergic receptors with an intravenous dose of phentolamine significantly reduced post-bombesin hypertension. These results indicate that bombesin-evoked increases in blood pressure do not require aortic depressor nerves and supranodosal <b>vagi</b> and are presumably mediated by the activation of peripheral �-adrenergic receptors. Bombesin-induced tachycardia was dependent on an intact supranodose pathway and was amplified by activation of �-adrenoceptors...|$|R

5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is usually}} initiated {{in combination with}} the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. There is some evidence of synergistic benefits when the diet is combined with the <b>vagus</b> nerve stimulator or with the drug zonisamide, and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving phenobarbital.|$|E
5|$|The lungs are {{supplied}} by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Input from the {{parasympathetic nervous system}} occurs via the <b>vagus</b> nerve. When stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E

5|$|In roughly 1 out {{of every}} 100200people, the right {{inferior}} laryngeal nerve is nonrecurrent, branching off the <b>vagus</b> nerve around {{the level of the}} cricoid cartilage. Typically, such a configuration is accompanied by variation in the arrangement of the major arteries in the chest; most commonly, the right subclavian artery arises from {{the left side of the}} aorta and crosses behind the esophagus. A left nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal nerve is even more uncommon, requiring the aortic arch be on the right side, accompanied by an arterial variant which prevents the nerve from being drawn into the chest by the left subclavian.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{controls}} {{the rate of}} breathing, mainly by respiratory centres in the medulla and pons. The respiratory centres control respiration, by generating motor signals that are passed down the spinal cord, along the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration. This is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information back to the centres. There are four respiratory centres, three with a more clearly defined function, and an apneustic centre with a less clear function. In the medulla a dorsal respiratory group causes the desire to breathe in and receives sensory information directly from the body. Also in the medulla, the ventral respiratory group influences breathing out during exertion. In the pons the pneumotaxic centre influences the duration of each breath, and the apneustic centre seems to have an influence on inhalation. The respiratory centres directly senses blood carbon dioxide and pH. Information about blood oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH levels are also sensed {{on the walls of}} arteries in the peripheral chemoreceptors of the aortic and carotid bodies. This information is passed via the <b>vagus</b> and glossopharyngeal nerves to the respiratory centres. High carbon dioxide, an acidic pH, or low oxygen stimulate the respiratory centres. The desire to breathe in is also affected by pulmonary stretch receptors in the lungs which, when activated, prevent the lungs from overinflating by transmitting information to the respiratory centres via the <b>vagus</b> nerve.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic {{muscles of the}} tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the <b>vagus</b> nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem {{as a number of}} small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two {{hypoglossal nerve}}s in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.|$|E

40|$|Cooling the {{cervical}} <b>vagi</b> of the anaesthetized splanchnectomized cat to 2 degrees C {{caused a}} 54. 4 +/- 8. 8 % inhibition of pancreatic electrolyte secretion stimulated submaximally with pure secretin. On rewarming the <b>vagi</b> {{there was a}} prolonged increase in secretion rate {{over and above the}} control rate which existed before cooling. The increase lasted about 90 min. There were no changes in acid/base status due to interference of the lung inflation reflex which could account for the inhibition of secretion and the subsequent rebound. Cold block of the cervical <b>vagi</b> increased the transpancreatic electrical conductance, indicating that vasodilation had occurred and therefore eliminated a vasomotor cause for the inhibition. Electrolyte secretion was also inhibited by bilateral vagal section. Atropine only partially prevented the inhibitory response to vagal cooling. A cholinergic mechanism, therefore, accounted for some but not all of the response to vagal cooling. It is concluded that even in the fasted, anaesthetized animal vagal impulses facilitate the action of secretin on the pancreas. This facilitation is only partially cholinergic; the major part of the response is due to some non-cholinergic transmitter substance. Such a mechanism may be necessary to potentiate the action of the very small amounts of secretin which appear to be released during a meal...|$|R
5|$|The vocal {{production}} system {{is controlled by}} the cranial nerve nucleus in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve, branches of the <b>vagus</b> nerve. The vocal tract is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerves. Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PEG) region of the mammalian midbrain elicit vocalizations. The ability to learn new vocalizations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, and possibly bats; in humans, this {{is the result of a}} direct connection between the motor cortex, which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the {{accessory}} nerve {{is described as}} having a small cranial component that descends from the medulla and briefly connects with the spinal accessory component before branching off of the nerve to join the <b>vagus</b> nerve. A study, published in 2007, of twelve subjects suggests that {{in the majority of}} individuals, this cranial component does not make any distinct connection to the spinal component; the roots of these distinct components were separated by a fibrous sheath in all but one subject.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurological}} disorders after stroke, and affects at least 50million people worldwide. It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent unprovoked seizures. These occur when cortical neurons fire excessively, hypersynchronously, or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be focal (confined to one part of the brain) or generalised (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy may occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic syndromes, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three anticonvulsant drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients will achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas about 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include epilepsy surgery, <b>vagus</b> nerve stimulation and the ketogenic diet.|$|E
