This theoretical tool permits us to progress, by analyzing different school books of CE 1 and CE 2 as well as maths sessions observed in classes of CE 2, that a deficiency in technological elements, would explain in part, the difficulties faced by pupils when developing flexibility and adaptability in mental calculation as well as when performing a calculation put in a column. Furthermore, the evaluation of the engineering that we have designed basing ourselves on the reference of mathematical organization and by staying « quite close » to the teachers practices shows the positive effects of a regular and progressive work from the arithmetical writings on the pupils learning. On the other hand, the experiments allow us to point out the limits of the situations that involve the propriety of the conservation of differences when these don’t engage enough the learner in a co-construction knowledge.

40|$|Light {{pollution}} is an environmental problem occurring with the improper application of artificial lighting systems. Light trespass, one significant type of light pollution, {{is difficult to}} be measured and evaluated in urban areas. In Beijing, a fully glazed office building could become a possible source of obtrusive light except for the street lighting, due to {{a fact that the}} security and nightscape requirements keep the indoor lighting on overnight. This article studied the impact of external overhang on the light trespass risk using Radiance simulation in a multi-story fully glazed office building. Two typical types of external overhang have been investigated: horizontal, tilt angle - 10 degree. For each type, three overhang depths were used: 0. 6 m, 1. 2 m and 1. 8 m. The illuminance levels at a <b>vertical</b> <b>calculation</b> plane (with a 10 m distance to façade) were calculated by Radiance, which express the magnitude of light trespass from the glazed façade. Several important findings have been achieved: averagely, the longest overhang (1. 8 m) reduces a relative illuminance level of 17 % with the bare window as a reference, while the shortest one only has a relative reduction of 5. 6 %; for the protection of trespass light, the overhang works well at a height of around 5 / 7 façade above ground. The methods would be possibly used for the light pollution investigation in a large scale urban area...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFirst-principle {{simulations}} {{aimed at}} accurately reproducing the excited state properties {{of a large}} series of ladder-type pi-conjugated organic molecules containing heteroatoms (Si, S, B, O, and N) have been performed. In particular, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations relying on several global and range-separated hybrid functionals {{have been carried out}} in conjunction with three variations of the polarizable continuum model (PCM), namely, the linear-response (LR), corrected linear-response (cLR), and state-specific (SS) approaches. For this series of molecules, similar to many borate derivatives, the cLR-PCM-TD-M 06 - 2 X approach can be used to reproduce the auxochromic effects that tune the 0 - 0 energies. However, TD-DFT yields rather large absolute deviations with respect to the experimental 0 - 0 energies.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Extended multireference {{configuration}} {{interaction with}} singles and doubles (MR-CISD) calculations of nitroethylene (H 2 CCHNO 2) {{were carried out}} to investigate the photodynamical deactivation paths to the ground state. The ground (S 0) and the first five valence excited electronic states (S 1 − S 5) were investigated. In the first step, vertical excitations and potential energy curves for CH 2 and NO 2 torsions and CH 2 out-of-plane bending starting from the ground state geometry were computed. Afterward, five conical intersections, one between each pair of adjacent states, were located. The <b>vertical</b> <b>calculations</b> mostly confirm the previous assignment of experimental spectrum and theoretical results using lower-level calculations. The conical intersections have as main features the torsion of the CH 2 moiety, different distortions of the NO 2 group and CC, CN, and NO bond stretchings. In these conical intersections, the NO 2 group plays an important role, also seen in excited state investigations of other nitro molecules. Based on the conical intersections found, a photochemical nonradiative deactivation process after a π−π * excitation to the bright S 5 state is proposed. In particular, the possibility of NO 2 release in the ground state, an important property in nitro explosives, {{was found to be}} possible. 1...|$|R

40|$|Coastal {{areas around}} the world are {{frequently}} attacked by various types of storms, threatening human life and property. This study aims to understand storm surge processes in large-scale coastal basins, particularly focusing on the influences of geometry, topography and storm characteristics on the water levels along the coast. To this end, an idealised process-based hydrodynamic model is developed. For arbitrary closed or semi-enclosed basins, it solves the linearised three-dimensional shallow water equations, including the Coriolis effect, forced by time- and space-dependent wind and pressure fields. The model’s linearity allows us to analyse the problem in terms of the basin's frequency response (which reflects its resonance properties). The model is fast because it decouples the <b>vertical</b> <b>calculations</b> (analytical) from the horizontal calculations. First, the spectral response of a closed rectangular basin of uniform depth, subject to periodic wind forcing, is found to depend on the spatial characteristics of the wind field and the basin dimensions. Wind with different spatial patterns (uniform, divergent and curl) produce different resonance peaks which are further modified by bottom friction and the Coriolis effect. The latter introduces new peaks associated with cross-wind basin dynamics. Then, in Chapter 3, investigation shows that adding topographic elements (e. g., a topographic step, a linearly sloping bed or a parabolic cross-basin profile) in semi-enclosed basins causes the resonance frequencies to shift, through their effect on local wave speed. In Chapter 4, the model first reproduce the surge caused by Hurricane Katrina, with a schematised domain and forced by the so-called Holland-B model. Next, the storm parameters are varied around the values resembling Hurricane Katrina to study storm characteristics’ influence. The storm direction and point of landfall are found {{to be the most important}} parameters determining the surge height. In particular, a storm approaching from south-east making landfall at the Mississippi dike produces the highest surge levels. Due to its flexibility regarding geometry, topography and forcing, and the short calculation times, the new model bridges the theoretical model and complex computationally expensive numerical model, and can thus be used as a quick estimation tool for extensive sensitivity studies...|$|R

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{assessment of}} the vertical stress on a coal seam at depth is important for mine design. <b>Vertical</b> stress <b>calculation</b> techniques presently available either are not sufficiently accurate or cannot handle complex surface topography. Therefore, the U. S. Bureau of Mines developed a computerized method to calculate vertical stress exerted on surfaces at depth that includes the effect of topography. Two input data sets are required: a digital elevation model containing topographic elevations and a coal seam file defining coal seam elevations at depth. Boussinesq's equation then quantifies the vertical stress resulting from topography. The computerized method was tested on a coal seam overlain by a complex topography where a vertical stress map encompassing several square miles was produced. Results show that depth mitigates the affects of surface topography, while the coal seam topography has a direct effect on the vertical stress. In comparison to the computerized method, the direct stress method overestimates stress under hills and underestimates stress under valleys. The largest {{difference between the two}} methods occurs under the steepest topographic relief.
