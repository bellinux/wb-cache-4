However, instead of using synchronous condensers for voltage control and reactive power supply to the thyristors, Madawaska uses switched filter and shunt reactor banks connected to the high voltage busses on each side.|$|E
50|$|The {{driving wheels}} were 44.6 inch in diameter, flanged upon their lower edge like the balance {{wheels of the}} trucks, and were mounted upon steel axles 6 inch in diameter, which extend through a sliding box {{containing}} the journals. The boxes slid in cast iron ways placed at right angle {{to the line of}} the engine, and each axle had a crank keyed upon its upper end. The well known slotted yoke connection was used. The slide valves were of the usual locomotive form. The links were placed in a horizontal instead of a vertical position, and were operated by two bell cranks. The throttle <b>valve,</b> <b>link</b> rod, brake, and coupling rods, and the connection between the driving boxes for producing pressure against the rails, were operated by hydraulic power, although hand levers were also provided.|$|E
50|$|A {{steam brake}} can be {{operated}} directly by a lever (valve) and also indirectly {{together with the}} vacuum brake. In the latter case, a control <b>valve</b> <b>linked</b> to the vacuum system controls the admission of steam to the brake cylinder, so that the steam brake can be activated automatically in an emergency or if the train separates (the so-called 'automatic steam brake').|$|R

50|$|Internally {{the fixed}} valve body is {{constructed}} as a cylinder, with the moving {{part of the}} valve within this as a piston. The conical valve {{is part of this}} piston. The piston is double-acting and splits the internal valve body in two, with water pressure on both sides. The upper side of the piston is larger, the full diameter of the piston, and is supplied with water through a throttling valve; normally adjusted and then left in position. The lower side of the piston is an annular space surrounding the moving valve body and maintained at the lower (Bernoulli) water pressure. The tip of the conical valve contains a small pilot <b>valve,</b> <b>linking</b> the upper chamber of the valve to the downstream drain below the valve. This pilot valve is controlled mechanically from outside the valve chamber and is the main control over the valve position.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel device {{based on the}} Magnetorheological (MR) fluid which has the {{capability}} to change stiffness and damping under control. MR fluid {{is a type of}} smart material whose properties could be controlled by the external magnetic field. Most of MR devices are MR dampers, which normally are used as variable damping devices. The presented device consists of two hydro-cylinder-spring structures and one MR <b>valve</b> <b>linking</b> these two structures. The rheological characteristics of MR fluid in the fluid flow channels of MR valve are controlled by the strength of magnetic fields, which directly affect the link conditions. The equivalent stiffness and damping coefficients of the device thus varies with the rheological characteristics of MR fluid simultaneously. A mathematical model is established to describe the properties of the proposed device based on the Bouc-wen model. The mathematical model the simulation results indicate that the proposed device can control both the stiffness and damping which has potential to be applied for restrain vibration mitigation efficiently...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{effective}} submarines, {{those of}} World War I, had hulls that were broadly circular in cross-section, with a deck plate mounted midway. Their heavy battery tanks were mounted beneath this deck, for stability. The ballast tanks were mounted inside the pressure hull. For compactness the ballast tanks were {{wrapped around the}} batteries, low down and sharing the flat surfaces of the battery tank. The Kingston <b>valves</b> <b>linking</b> the ballast tanks to the sea could be left open, a practice known as [...] "riding the valves", and the water level in the tanks controlled solely by the vent and blowing air valves. The drawback was that the ballast tanks, open to sea pressure, had a flat surface to the crew compartment and were thus restricted in strength to the bursting strength of this flat plate. In particular this led to accidents where the boat bottomed safely after an accident, but the excess pressure of [...] "blowing out" [...] was sufficient to cause the internal tank wall to fail.|$|R
5000|$|... 3. Injection valve: A {{motorized}} <b>valve</b> which <b>links</b> the mixer {{and sample}} loop to the column. Typically the valve has three positions for loading the sample loop, for injecting the sample from the loop into the column, and for connecting the pumps {{directly to the}} waste line to wash them or change buffer solutions. The injection valve has a sample loading port through which the sample can be loaded into the injection loop, usually from a hypodermic syringe using a Luer-lock connection.|$|R
5000|$|The London and South Western Railway L11 {{class was}} {{a class of}} 4-4-0 steam {{locomotives}} designed for mixed traffic work. They were introduced in 1903 and were nicknamed [...] "Large Hoppers". As with most other Drummond productions, the locomotive had two inside cylinders and Stephenson <b>link</b> <b>valve</b> gear.|$|R
50|$|To {{be able to}} {{negotiate}} sharp curves, both the first and fifth pairs of coupled wheels of the Reid Tenwheeler locomotive were flangeless.

2500|$|The design spawned {{from the}} {{relative}} failure of Drummond's C8 Class of 1898, utilising many {{lessons learned from}} this design. [...] A larger boiler was implemented, and such confidence was placed in Drummond's design that an order of 50 locomotives was placed straight off the drawing board. Large fireboxes and Stephenson <b>link</b> <b>valve</b> gear ensured a free-steaming locomotive.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} used {{saturated steam}} and had flat [...] "D" [...] type slide valves, placed above the cylinders {{and operated by}} Stephenson <b>Link</b> <b>valve</b> gear through rocker shafts. The leading wheels were mounted in a spring control bogie {{which was designed to}} overcome the problems of excessive flange wear on the coupled wheels and rail cutting on curves.|$|R
50|$|Developments {{after the}} {{separate}} expansion valve {{led to more}} sophisticated valve gears that could achieve the same goal of varying inlet lap with a single valve. The first of these were the <b>link</b> <b>valve</b> gears, particularly the Stephenson <b>link</b> <b>valve</b> gear. This uses a pair of eccentrics with a sliding link mechanism between them {{that acts as a}} mechanical adding device. Selecting intermediate positions provides a valve actuation with the effect of increasing cut-off. As such valve gears also provided, and were first developed for, reversing, they were widely used on locomotives. Theoretically, the precise effect is that of reduced valve travel, rather than an earlier cut-off. This has the effect of reducing overall valve opening, reducing initial steam supply and so having the effect of wire-drawing rather than pure expansion. Despite this, the Stephenson gear became one of the two most-widely used gears for locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The coil {{receives}} hot or {{cold water}} from a central plant, and removes heat from or adds heat to the air through heat transfer. Traditionally fan coil units can contain their own internal thermostat, or can be wired to operate with a remote thermostat. However, and as is common in most modern buildings with a Building Energy Management System (BEMS), {{the control of the}} fan coil unit will be by a local digital controller or outstation (along with associated room temperature sensor and control <b>valve</b> actuators) <b>linked</b> to the BEMS via a communication network, and therefore adjustable and controllable from a central point, such as a supervisors head end computer.|$|R
50|$|The Cape 9th Class {{locomotive}} {{was designed}} by H.M. Beatty, the Locomotive Superintendent of the Cape Government Railways (CGR) from 1896 to 1910. They were the first South African locomotives to have a 2-8-2 Mikado wheel arrangement and they were built with bar frames, had Stephenson’s <b>Link</b> <b>valve</b> gear and used saturated steam. Two locomotives were delivered by Kitson and Company in 1903, numbered 805 and 806.|$|R
50|$|The locomotive's slide valves were {{arranged}} above the inclined cylinders and were actuated by Joy valve gear, {{which had been}} invented in 1879 by David Joy, the Locomotive Superintendent of the Oxford, Dorchester and Wolverhampton Railway.

50|$|The Cape 9th Class Mikado type steam {{locomotive}} {{was designed by}} H.M. Beatty, the Locomotive Superintendent of the Cape Government Railways (CGR) from 1896 to 1910.

50|$|The locomotive's {{trailing}} wheels were positioned {{below the}} firebox. The cylinders were arranged outside the frames, with flat Murdoch's D slide valves arranged at an incline above the cylinders and actuated by Allan straight <b>link</b> <b>valve</b> gear, driven by eccentric sheaves which were {{mounted on a}} return crank. The brakes were actuated by hand screw from the cab. The engine had 4 in thick wooden buffer beams and was equipped with cowcatchers.|$|R
40|$|A short axis echocardiographic cut of {{the heart}} from the subcostal {{approach}} was used to study the atrioventricular junction in 47 infants and children with congenital heart disease and 20 with normal hearts. Examination of the diastolic openings of both atrioventricular valves was able to establish normal developments of the valves and annuli even when this was found in cases of complex congenital heart disease. In 30 patients with atrioventricular septal defects the technique distinguished between a partial defect (when the two atrioventricular <b>valves</b> were <b>linked</b> transseptally) and a complete defect (when {{there was only one}} atrioventricular valve). A range of atrioventricular attachments was seen in these patients. Short axis echocardiography from the subcostal approach reliably identifies different forms of atrioventricular septal defects by defining the anatomy of the atrioventricular valves during maximal diastolic expansion...|$|R

In one experiment, a 22, 000 m 1 sphere is to ride into orbit containing a 15 psi Earth atmosphere. Once in orbit, a controller directs a <b>valve</b> to open, <b>linking</b> the sphere to a vacuum of space.

40|$|Ionic diode" (or current rectification) {{effects are}} {{potentially}} {{important for a}} range of applications including water purification. In this preliminary report, we observe novel ionic diode behaviour of thin (300 nm) membranes based on a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-EA-TB) supported on a poly-ethylene-terephthalate (PET) film with a 20 μm diameter microhole, and immersed in aqueous electrolyte media. Current rectification effects are observed for half-cells with the same electrolyte solution {{on both sides of the}} membrane for cases where cation and anion mobility differ (HCl, other acids, NaOH, etc.) but not for cases where cation and anion mobility are more alike (LiCl, NaCl, KCl, etc.). A pH-dependent reversal of the ionic diode effect is observed and discussed in terms of tentatively assigned mechanisms based on both (i) ion mobility within the PIM-EA-TB nano-membrane and (ii) a possible "mechanical <b>valve</b> effect" <b>linked</b> to membrane potential and electrokinetic movement of the membrane as well as hydrostatic pressure effects...|$|R
5000|$|The spread-bore four-barrel carburetor, first {{released}} by Rochester in the 1965 model {{year as the}} [...] "Quadrajet" [...] has a much greater spread between the sizes of the primary and secondary throttle bores. The primaries in such a carburetor are quite small relative to conventional four-barrel practice, while the secondaries are quite large. The small primaries aid low-speed fuel economy and driveability, while the large secondaries permit maximum performance when it is called for. To tailor airflow through the secondary Venturis, each of the secondary throats has an air valve at the top. This is configured much like a choke plate, and is lightly spring-loaded into the closed position. The air valve opens progressively in response to engine speed and throttle opening, gradually allowing more air to flow through the secondary side of the carburetor. Typically, the air <b>valve</b> is <b>linked</b> to metering rods which are raised as the air valve opens, thereby adjusting secondary fuel flow.|$|R
50|$|To {{negotiate}} sharp curves, {{both the}} first and fifth pairs of coupled wheels were flangeless. The cylinders were arranged outside the plate frame, while the Richardson balanced type slide valves were placed between the frames. The locomotive used saturated steam and was equipped with Allan straight <b>link</b> <b>valve</b> gear, which was reversed by hand-wheel and quick screw gear. Allan valve gear was chosen chiefly because it required less space than the more usual Stephenson lifting link gear and was simpler in construction. The trailing Bissel truck was of the Cartazzi type which allowed the axle some lateral movement.|$|R
50|$|The Richardson {{governor}} {{was used for}} stationary and portable engines produced by his employers, Robey & Co.. This is a simple <b>link</b> <b>valve</b> gear controlled automatically by a centrifugal governor. Rather than the Stephenson's manual control of the die-block position within the oscillating link, the Richardson governor adjusts this according to engine speed. It usually operated similarly to a Meyer valve, with two valves driven by two eccentrics and the Richardson governor used instead of the Meyer's manual handwheel. This avoided the wire-drawing problem of the Stephenson's reduced valve travel and improved efficiency for stationary engines that might run at low power for long periods.|$|R
50|$|These {{enable a}} 3-cylinder or 4-cylinder {{locomotive}} {{to be built}} with only two sets of valve gear. The best known is Gresley conjugated valve gear, used on 3-cylinder locomotives. Walschaerts gear is usually used for the two outside cylinders. Two levers connected to the outside cylinder valve rods drive the valve for the inside cylinder. Harold Holcroft devised a different method for conjugating <b>valve</b> gear by <b>linking</b> the middle cylinder to the combination lever assembly of an outside cylinder, creating the Holcroft valve gear derivative. On a 4-cylinder locomotive the arrangement is simpler. The valve gear may be inside or outside and only short rocking-shafts are needed to <b>link</b> the <b>valves</b> {{on the inside and}} outside cylinders.|$|R
25|$|The Biggest {{exhibit is}} a {{locomotive}} named Nellie, after Nellie Crane the vicar's wife. Nellie is an 0-4-0 saddle tank industrial locomotive 1435, {{one of two}} built by Hudswell Clarke in Leeds in 1922 for the Esholt sewage works. When the works were being built, she carried excavated material, and thereafter coal and construction material, then coal and other materials until 1970 when she was loaned to the Yorkshire Dales Railway Society at Skipton. Her size is ca.23 x 8 x 11ft, and she weighs 28 tons. The boiler works at 160psi, and she carries 700 gallons in the saddle water tank. The cylinders are 40-inch diameter 20-inch stroke operated by Stephenson's open <b>link</b> <b>valve</b> gear. A British Railways Crane Wagon is on display outside near the museum gates.|$|R
50|$|The {{valve gear}} (or 'working gear') of a Newcomen or Cornish engine {{is based on}} the plug rod. This is a {{vertical}} rod, hung from the beam, and moving in parallel to the piston. Adjustable tappets are attached to this rod. These tappets strike long curved iron levers or 'horns' that are carried on three horizontal shafts or 'arbors'. Each arbor works one of the engine's valves. For the Cornish cycles, these valves are the upper steam inlet {{to the top of the}} cylinder, the equilibrium <b>valve</b> that <b>links</b> upper and lower portions of the cylinder, and the lower exhaust and condensing water injection valves, which share an arbor. Unlike most other steam engines, these engines could be run intermittently: making a single stroke before stopping and waiting for the valves to be restarted again. The speed of each power stroke or 'coming indoors' was a feature of the engine and was not easily varied, but there was no need for the engines to run continuously, stroke after stroke. This was a direct contrast to the rotative beam engine, and the rotary nature of almost all other steam engines. With the original Newcomen cycle, the speed of the return stroke varied according to the boiler pressure, although this still did not affect the strength or speed of the power stroke.|$|R
5000|$|The Allan {{straight}} <b>link</b> <b>valve</b> gear (invented by Alexander Allan in 1855) {{combined the}} features of the Stephenson and Gooch gears. The reversing and cut-off functions were achieved by simultaneously raising the radius rod and lowering the link or vice versa. As with the Gooch gear, this saved space but the Allan gear gave performance closer to that of the Stephenson. Moreover, the straight expansion link simplified manufacture. Once again, the Allan gear was not often used in the UK but fairly common on the Continent. Notable UK examples are the GWR 1361 and 1366 classes, and narrow gauge locomotives produced by George England (e.g. [...] "Prince" [...] & [...] "Palmerston" [...] in preservation on the Ffestiniog Railway) and Fletcher-Jennings (No 1 [...] "Tallyllyn" [...] & No 2 [...] "Dolgoch" [...] in preservation on the Talyllyn Railway).|$|R

40|$|The perfect {{function}} of the mitral <b>valve</b> is <b>linked</b> to the anatomical conformation and physiological interaction of all the component of the mitral valve complex (leaflets, annulus, chordae, papillary muscles, left ventricle). The most {{important component of the}} valve are the leaflets. The nomenclature and the number of the leaflets are divergent in different studies. Usually the clinical Carpentier’s Classification is used, which identifies three posterior leaflet scallops: from antero-lateral (P 1) to central (P 2) and postero-medial (P 3). The terminology of mitral valve leaflet is a lot debated in the scientific literature. The aim of the study is to analyze the variability of the anatomy of posterior leaflet in normal subjects (Autoptic and cardiectomy specimens) and patients with myxomatous disease (three dimensional echocardiography) for assess possible difference and similarity. In patient with myxomatous disease we evaluate the clinical influence of the anatomy of the posterior leaflet on the planning of the mitral valve surgical repair strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty normal heart specimens without mitral valve disease, were examined by three independent observers (two pathologists and 1 cardiologist). The specimens which had been fixed in formalin following autopsy or cardiectomy, were selected in the anatomo-pathological heart collection of Padua University. The mitral valve was opened along the optus margin of the heart and evaluated. It was used a new terminology and call the normal physiological indentation, deep more than 50...|$|R
