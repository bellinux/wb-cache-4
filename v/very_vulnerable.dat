5|$|Because of its slow {{reproductive}} rate, the {{dusky shark}} is <b>very</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to human-caused population depletion. This species is highly valued by commercial fisheries for its fins, used in shark fin soup, {{and for its}} meat, skin, and liver oil. It is also esteemed by recreational fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable off the eastern United States, where populations have dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. The dusky shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans due to its large size, but there are few attacks attributable to it.|$|E
5|$|The same {{isolation}} {{that produced}} Kohala's unique ecosystem {{also makes it}} <b>very</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to invasive species. Alien plants and feral animals are among the greatest threats to the local ecology. Plants like the kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum) and the strawberry guava (Psidium cattleinum) displace native species. Prior to human settlement, many major organisms such as conifers and rodents never made it onto the island, so the ecosystem never developed defenses against them, leaving Hawaii vulnerable to damage by hoofed animals, rodents, and predation.|$|E

Similarly, on average the {{proportion of}} households with sewage treatment service is 81.55  % in the less vulnerable category but is 43.67  % in the <b>very</b> highly <b>vulnerable</b> category. A similar result is observed for the proportion of households receiving water through a public piped system: the proportion is 67.54  % in the less vulnerable category, 33.95  % in the highly vulnerable category, and 27.8  % in the <b>very</b> highly <b>vulnerable.</b>|$|R
30|$|For the {{adaptive}} capacity indicators {{we find that}} agricultural land tenure (i.e. the proportion of households owning agricultural land with respect to total agricultural land) is not significantly different between the moderately <b>vulnerable</b> to the <b>very</b> highly <b>vulnerable</b> categories. In these groups on average 71  % of farmers own the land where they work. This figure increases to 85  % for the less vulnerable category. There is, however, {{a significant difference between}} the less and <b>very</b> highly <b>vulnerable</b> groups. In addition, for the proportion of the population working in agriculture, silviculture or hunting, 25.53  % work in cantons in the less vulnerable category. This figure increases to 52.35  % in the rest of the vulnerability categories.|$|R
5|$|Battlecruisers {{served in}} the navies of the UK, Germany, the Ottoman Empire, Australia and Japan during World War I, most notably at the Battle of the Falkland Islands and in the several raids and skirmishes in the North Sea which culminated in a pitched fleet battle, the Battle of Jutland. British battlecruisers in {{particular}} suffered heavy losses at Jutland, where their light armour made them <b>very</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to large-caliber shells. By {{the end of the}} war, capital ship design had developed with battleships becoming faster and battlecruisers becoming more heavily armoured, blurring the distinction between a battlecruiser and a fast battleship. The Washington Naval Treaty, which limited capital ship construction from 1922 onwards, treated battleships and battlecruisers identically, and the new generation of battlecruisers planned was scrapped {{under the terms of the}} treaty.|$|E
5|$|Charles I, {{who ruled}} from 1331 to 1357, {{and was the}} son of François Grimaldi's cousin Rainier I, {{significantly}} enlarged the fortress by adding two large buildings: one against the eastern ramparts and the second looking out over the sea. This changed the appearance of the fortress, making it appear more of a fortified house than a fortress. The fortifications remained very necessary, for during the next three decades the fortress was alternately lost and regained by the Grimaldi to the Genoese. In 1341 the Grimaldi took Menton and then Roquebrune, thus consolidating their power and strength in the area. Subsequently they strengthened not only the defences of the harbour but also their fortress on the Rocher. The Grimaldi's stronghold was now a power base from which the family ruled a large but <b>very</b> <b>vulnerable</b> area of land.|$|E
5|$|Mainly {{active at}} night, the sharptooth houndshark feeds mostly on crustaceans, bony fishes, and cephalopods. It has been {{observed}} gathering in groups in shallow water during summertime, possibly for reproductive purposes. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the unborn young are sustained mainly by yolk. Females give birth to 6–12 pups between late May and August, on a two- or three-year cycle. The sharptooth houndshark is often hooked by recreational anglers, and some are also captured on commercial bottom longlines. Because of its small range, its low growth and reproductive rates, it is <b>very</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to overfishing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has therefore listed this species as Near Threatened.|$|E

40|$|A new {{technique}} {{was developed for}} estimating groundwater vulnerability to nitrate contamination from non-point sources (NPS) on a regional scale. The technique follows a numerical ranking approach and considers the hydrogeologic settings of the region along with a GIS (Geographic Information System) data layer showing spatial distributions of nitrate leached, for predicting pollution potential of a region to groundwater contamination. ^ The {{new technique}} was applied to evaluate vulnerability of groundwater systems in Indiana using a GIS environment at a 1 : 250, 000 scale. The new technique classified 57 % of the state within highly and <b>very</b> highly <b>vulnerable</b> areas. A Bayesian weights of evidence model was used for statistically validating the choice of factors considered in the new model for regional scale assessment of groundwater quality. Spatial statistics were computed to eliminate some of the detections due to point sources of pollution in a water quality database. The results from the new technique were compared with the water quality database to determine {{the accuracy of the}} model predictions. Ninety two (92) percent of the nitrate detections fell in highly and <b>very</b> highly <b>vulnerable</b> areas as predicted by the new model. ^ Vulnerability of Indiana aquifer systems to NPS of pollution was also evaluated using DRASTIC and SEEPAGE analyses. DRASTIC classified 25 % of the state within highly and <b>very</b> highly <b>vulnerable</b> areas, while SEEPAGE classified 28 % of the state within highly and <b>very</b> highly <b>vulnerable</b> areas. A comparison of the model predictions with the water quality database showed that 80 % of the nitrate detections were within the highly and very highly vulnerability areas as predicted by the DRASTIC model and 64 % of the nitrate detections were within highly and very highly vulnerability areas as predicted by the SEEPAGE model. The new model performed better than both the DRASTIC and SEEPAGE models in predicting areas vulnerable to nitrate pollution. Overall, the new technique shows significant potential to improve regional groundwater vulnerability estimates. ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the weeks}} after Operation Mascot, Tirpitz {{continued}} to prepare for potential combat operations. Following trials in the sheltered waters of Altafjord, she put to sea on 31 July and 1 August to train with her protective destroyers. Additional smoke generators were also installed around Kaafjord to improve the area's already strong defences. These activities were reported by spies, and the British Admiralty interpreted them to mean that Tirpitz was being readied for a raid against Allied shipping. To defend against this threat, {{it was decided to}} conduct further attacks against the battleship at her anchorage in Kaafjord {{at the time of the}} next series of Arctic convoys. In reality, the German Navy was not planning to use Tirpitz offensively as she would be <b>very</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to the superior Allied naval and air forces if she put to sea. Instead, the battleship was being maintained in active service to tie down Allied warships and aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The RAF {{high command}} never warmed to missiles, and always ranked them {{secondary}} to the V-bomber force. The missile bases were separate {{from the rest of}} the RAF and its personnel considered outside the mainstream. Project Emily gave the RAF considerable experience in missile operations, but the cancellation of Blue Streak on 2 February 1960 in favour of Skybolt, an air-launched ballistic missile, rendered this expertise of dubious value. Given the amount of time and money spent on Thor, consideration was given to extending the deployment. Responding to the arguments made for and against Blue Streak, there were proposals for improving Thor. If the missiles were already fuelled, then they could be launched in as little as 60 seconds, but they could only remain fuelled for two hours, after which components froze from contact with the liquid oxygen. The missiles then needed six hours to thaw out. It was impractical to base them underground, but being above ground made them <b>very</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to a nuclear attack. Yet the twenty Thor missiles squadrons were equivalent to seven and a half squadrons of V-bombers. Without them, there would be just fourteen V-bombers on quick alert.|$|E
5|$|The {{dive bomber}} wing {{supported}} Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps in its two-year campaign in North Africa; its other main task was attacking Allied shipping.

It served during the Battle of Gazala and the First Battle of El Alamein, {{as well as the}} decisive Second Battle of El Alamein, which drove Rommel back to Tunisia. As the tide turned and Allied air power grew in the autumn of 1942, the Ju 87 became <b>very</b> <b>vulnerable</b> and losses were heavy. The entry of the Americans into North Africa during Operation Torch made the situation far worse; the Stuka was obsolete in what was now a fighter-bomber's war. The Bf 109 and Fw 190 could at least fight enemy fighters on equal terms after dropping their ordnance but the Stuka could not. The Ju 87's vulnerability was demonstrated on 11 November 1942, when 15 Ju 87 Ds were shot down by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Curtiss P-40Fs in minutes.|$|E

5|$|Banksia cuneata lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, this species is {{strongly}} serotinous: seed is released only following a fire. Thus plants accumulate an aerial seed bank in fire intervals, which is released all at once after a fire, ensuring population regeneration. The mechanism is a resin that seals the follicles shut, preventing dehiscence; {{the heat of a}} bushfire melts the resin, and the follicles open. Intense fires cause the immediate release of the seed and seed separator, but after cooler fires the seed separator often remains in place, blocking the follicle exit and preventing seed release. The wings on the seed separator are hygroscopic; they draw together when moistened, then reflex out again as they dry. Thus they lever themselves, and the seeds, out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles, ensuring that seed is released only after rain has fallen. The juvenile period for B.cuneata is around four years. Populations are <b>very</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to fire during this period, as fire will wipe out the entire population {{and there will be no}} seed from which it might recover. A model-based investigation found that the optimal fire interval for maximising population size over the medium term is around 15 years. More frequent fires reduce population size by killing adults before they have reached their full fecundity. Less frequent fires reduce population size because there are fewer opportunities for seed dispersal and germination. However, the optimal fire interval for minimising the risk of extinct in the long term is probably much longer.|$|E

40|$|Groundwater {{pollution}} {{is one of}} the most serious environmental problems in the world. Human activities, e. g. industrial, agricultural and household represent a real threat for groundwater quality. In areas where Groundwater constitutes the main drinking water resources, its vulnerability assessment, to delineate areas that are more susceptible to contamination has become an important element for water resource management and land use planning. Hence, maps of groundwater vulnerability to pollution are becoming more in demand because this essential resource for life represents the main source of drinking water in many parts of the world and particularly in northern China where there is insufficient surface water. This study used the ArcGIS 9. 2 software and geographical information system (GIS) techniques to apply an EPA model for determining intrinsic vulnerability of groundwater to pollution in Linfen Basin, Shanxi Province, China.   The model is called DRASTIC, representing hydrogeological parameters such as Depth to Aquifer, Net Recharge, Aquifer Media, Soil Media, Topography, Impact of vadose Zones, and Hydraulic Conductivity. The DRASTIC model uses environmental parameters to characterize the hydrogeological setting of any area and to evaluate the aquifer vulnerability. The DRASTIC scores obtained from the model vary from 59 to 147, where the higher value implies the relative greater vulnerability. These values were reclassified into three classes: very low, low and moderate vulnerable zones. The moderate vulnerability zones of Linfen Basin are located in the north and southeastern part of the basin. The moderate vulnerable zones cover around 16. 38 % of the study area. Huozhou City in the north, Yicheng County, Qu Wo County in the south east are concerned by moderate vulnerability zones. The   <b>very</b> low <b>vulnerable</b> zones are well distributed and are mainly located in the middle and south parts of the basin. Some <b>very</b> low <b>vulnerable</b> zones can also be seen in the north east and extreme east parts. <b>Very</b> low <b>vulnerable</b> zones cover about 40. 13 % of the study area. The remaining parts of the Linfen basin are under low vulnerable zones (43. 49 %) which are located in the west and Middle West parts of the region. The results of this study can be used to determine where communities should undertake aggressive protection of the groundwater.   Regional development planners will benefit from knowledge of local sensitive aquifers. </p...|$|R
