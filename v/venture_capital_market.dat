25|$|Start-ups need {{venture capital}} to thrive. Between 2004 and 2013, {{the venture capital}} {{industry}} played {{a fundamental role in}} the development of Israel’s high-tech sector, including by financing start-ups. By 2013, Israeli companies had raised more venture capital as a share of GDP than companies in any other country. Israel's <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> attracted US$2 346 million alone in 2013. Today, Israel is considered one of the biggest centres for venture capital in the world outside the USA. Several factors have contributed to this growth. These include tax exemptions on Israeli venture capital, funds established in conjunction with large international banks and financial companies and the involvement of major organizations desirous to capitalize on the strengths of Israeli high-tech companies. These organizations include some of the world’s largest multinational companies, including Apple, Cisco, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle Siemens and Samsung. In recent years, the share of venture capital invested in the growth stages of enterprises has flourished at the expense of early stage investments.|$|E

This paper examines the conditions {{that have to be}} fulfilled for liquid <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>markets</b> to emerge. Using a general equilibrium model, two necessary conditions are identified. First, value added by venture capitalists' active involvement must be high compared to the costs of management support.

Accordingly, governments have taken measures to support the development and efficient functioning of national <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>markets.</b> As a policy response, particularly in the more problematic early-stage investment area, many countries have set up government financed support programs to channel risk <b>capital</b> to new <b>ventures</b> through private VC funds. The choice of the incentive structure for a publicly co-financed and privately managed <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> fund is crucial {{for the success of}} a program. However, there is very little robust research determining the actual effects of different structures on fund performance.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an analysis}} of the impact of Legality on the exiting of <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> investments. We consider a sample of 468 venture-backed companies from 12 Asia-Pacific countries, and these countries' venture capitalists' investments in US-based entrepreneurial firms. The data indicate IPOs are more likely in countries with a higher Legality index. This core result is robust to controls for country-specific stock market capitalization, MSCI market conditions, venture capitalist fund manager skill and fund characteristics, and entrepreneurial firm and transaction characteristics. Although Black and Gilson (1998) speculate on a central connection between active stock <b>markets</b> and active <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>markets,</b> our data in fact indicate the quality of a country's legal system is much more directly connected to facilitating VC-backed IPO exits than the size of a country's stock market.

40|$|The {{nature and}} extent of complementarities between the {{informal}} and formal <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>markets</b> {{has been the subject of}} limited research. In the United States, complementarity has been demonstrated in terms of both size of investment and stage of business development: angel investors dominate in financing rounds of less than $ 500, 000 and at seed and start-up stages. More recent research questions the generalisability of the findings: in the UK a small scale study found no evidence of complementarity for technology based firms, and a more recent US study concluded that the relationships between business angels and <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> firms appeared to be weaker in the 1990 s. In this paper we explore systematically complementarities between the formal and informal <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>markets,</b> and identify, where possible, the opportunities for additional collaboration. Five types of complementarities are identified: co-investing in deals; sequential investing in ventures; business angels as investors in <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> funds; deal referring; and fund raising by business angels for ventures in which they have invested. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This article {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} European venture capital activity. The main novelty of our work is in accounting for the idiosyncrasies of the European <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>market.</b> In particular, we investigate whether {{the size of the}} merger and acquisition market (M&A) is important in explaining venture capital. Moreover, our work is the first that analyses the impact of the degree of information asymmetry at the macro level, the direct impact of the level of entrepreneurial activity and the impact of the unemployment rate on venture capital activity. We use aggregate data from 23 European countries for the period 1998 – 2003 to estimate panel data models with fixed and random effects. Our results reveal that the size of the M&A market and the market-to-book ratio {{have a positive impact on}} venture capital activity whereas the unemployment rate influences the <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> negatively.

40|$|Business angels {{provide both}} {{financing}} and managerial experience, which {{increase the likelihood}} of the survival of innovative start-ups. Over the last years, European countries with developing informal <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>markets</b> have seen governments support the creation of business angels networks (BANs) to increase and consolidate these markets.

This paper demonstrates that is evidence of positive contribution of BANs in terms of bringing together investors and linking them with entrepreneur’s seeking finance.
