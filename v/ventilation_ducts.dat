5|$|On 19 November 1944, Shinano was {{formally}} commissioned at Yokosuka, having spent {{the previous two}} weeks fitting out and performing sea trials. Worried about her safety after a U.S. reconnaissance bomber fly-over, the Navy General Staff ordered Shinano to depart for Kure by no later than 28 November, where the remainder of her fitting-out would take place. Abe asked for a delay in the sailing date as the majority of her watertight doors {{had yet to be}} installed, the compartment air tests had not been conducted, and many holes in the compartment bulkheads for electrical cables, <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts</b> and pipes had not been sealed. Importantly, fire mains and bailing systems lacked pumps and were inoperable; even though most of the crew had sea-going experience, they lacked training in the portable pumps on board. The escorting destroyers, Isokaze, Yukikaze and Hamakaze, had just returned from the Battle of Leyte Gulf and required more than three days to conduct repairs and to allow their crews to recuperate.|$|E

The tonal noise produced by the fans may interfere with the daily activities of the crew as well as pose a po-tential health hazard. Because a Helmholtz resonator’s unique geometry allows it to resonate at a specific frequency, {{it is possible to}} design a Helmholtz resonator that will eliminate the single frequency tonal noise when adjacently attached to a <b>ventilation</b> <b>duct.</b> Therefore, this project focused on how to incorporate Helmholtz resonators into a model <b>ventilation</b> <b>duct</b> in order to eliminate tonal noise produced by a fan. This project was completed using two different methods: analytical and experi-mental. The analytical approach involved calculating transmission loss predictions in order to determine how various Helmholtz resonators would affect the sound level of the tonal noise when introduced into the <b>ventilation</b> <b>duct.</b> The experimental approach in-volved constructing a model <b>ventilation</b> <b>duct</b> from medium density fiberboard (MDF) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper briefly reviews {{prediction}} {{techniques for}} determination of leakage and friction along auxiliary <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducting</b> systems. In order to compare various prediction techniques {{that have been}} developed over the past, a macroscopic investigation of air leakage and friction resistance of auxiliary <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducting</b> systems has been undertaken. Measurements were conducted on 450 and 915 mm diameter fabric ducting over 100 m duct length to determine frictional resistances and the extent of leakage. Due to the high degree of accuracy required and the large volume of data that needed to be collected, electronic pressure transducers were used with computer for data recording. Conceptual models that describe the leakage characteristics of auxiliary <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducting</b> systems were developed based on this information. It was found that these models provided good correlation with most of the existing prediction techniques. The experimental methodology relying on computer data acquisition has allowed the accuracy of measured values to be treated {{with a high degree of}} confidence. The reliability of the developed models allows prediction of leakage, frictional impedance and airflow with enhanced confidence...|$|R
