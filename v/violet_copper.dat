40|$|The <b>violet</b> <b>copper</b> (Lycaena helle Denis & Schiffermueller, 1775) was studied using mark-release- {{recapture}} {{method in}} West Khentii in northern Mongolia. The netting method {{was used for}} collecting the <b>violet</b> <b>copper</b> during one hour standardised sample in different biotopes. <b>Violet</b> <b>copper</b> was found predominantly in the wet, mesophilous grassland and herb meadows, but it {{also found in the}} birch forests in the riparian zone the valley {{as well as in the}} mixed forests consisted of Larix sibirica and Betula platyphylla. We examined the movement and individual occurrence through the habitat types of West Khentii. The mean distance between the fi rst and subsequent capture points in the open area were greater than that of in fragmented landscapes for both sexes (107 ± 76 and 44 ± 41 m for females and males, respectively). The single greatest movement distance between recaptures was 386 m for females and 163 m for males...|$|E
40|$|Latex {{nanoparticles}} functionalized with cyclam (1, 4, 8, 11 -tetraazacyclotetradecane), {{a copper}} chelator, have been doped with a fluorescent dye 1 (BODIPY derivative: 4, 4 -difluoro- 8 -(2, 4, 6 -trimethyl) phenyl- 2, 6 -diethyl- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetramethyl- 4 -bora- 3 a, 4 a-diaza-s-indacene). The bulky, hydrophobic fluorophore 1 dissolves within the nanoparticles' polymer core up to {{a concentration of}} about 88. 4 lmol g- 1. At this concentration the fluorescence yield is about 0. 80. Adding Cu 2 + ions to the solution decreases the fluorescence because of the energy transfer between the dye and the <b>violet</b> <b>copper</b> cyclam complexes. The response is fast: 90 % of the quenching occurs within 1 s. The Cu 2 + detection threshold is of 1 nanomolar. No interferences were observed with zinc and nickel ions...|$|E
50|$|Cetonia aurata, {{called the}} rose chafer or the green rose chafer, is a beetle, 20 mm (¾ in) long, {{that has a}} {{metallic}} structurally coloured green and a distinct V-shaped scutellum. The scutellum is the small V-shaped area between the wing cases; it may show several small, irregular, white lines and marks. The underside of the beetle has a coppery colour, and its upper side is sometimes bronze, <b>copper,</b> <b>violet,</b> blue/black, or grey.|$|R
40|$|We {{adopted a}} resource-based habitat {{approach}} {{to better understand}} the distribution and conservation of the <b>Violet</b> <b>Copper</b> butterfly, the focal species of this book. The significance of this organism-centered, behavioural approach of habitat to understand and conserve butterflies, instead of using general vegetation types as surrogates of a species’ habitat, has recently been advocated. This approach aims for integrating the key functional relationships between the organism and the essential consumables and conditions in the environment focusing on both adult and larval stages. Thus, we summarized our knowledge on the resource-based habitat-use in L. helle based on field data from the Belgian Ardenne region. We included demographic and behavioural data and models explaining the abundance of males and females, the egg distribution and the survival from the egg stage until the third larval instar. Finally, we discussed the new insights on habitatuse of L. helle across its life cycle and the significance of these findings and the resource-based habitat concept for the conservation of L. helle in Belgium and elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|While {{there is}} {{agreement}} that both habitat quality and habitat network characteristics (such as patch size and isolation) {{contribute to the}} occupancy of patches by any given species, {{the relative importance of}} these factors is under debate. This issue is of fundamental ecological importance, and moreover of special concern for conservation biologists aiming at preserving endangered species. Against this background we investigated patch occupancy in the <b>violet</b> <b>copper</b> Lycaena helle, one of the rarest butterfly species in Central Europe, in the Westerwald area (Rhineland-Palatinate, Western Germany). Occupied (n = 102) differed from vacant (n = 128) patches in altitude, size, connectivity, availability of wind shelter, in the abundance of the larval host-plant, in the abundance of a grass species indicating favorable habitat conditions and in the abundance of nitrophilous plants. Overall, patch occupancy was primarily determined by patch size, connectivity and the abundance of the larval host plant, while all other parameters of habitat quality were of subordinate importance. Therefore, our findings suggest that even for extremely sedentary species such as L. helle habitat networks are decisive and—next to the preservation of habitat quality—need to {{be an integral part of}} any conservation management for this species...|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{preservation}} and restoration are cornerstones of species ´ conservation {{and the main}} challenge for nature managers. To preserve species, lots of preventive measures or restoration projects are in progress in Europe. But, to improve {{the effectiveness of this}} undertaking, it would be highly desirable to: (1) identify precisely species ´ habitat requirements, (2) develop means to maintain or restore habitats, (3) assess effects of diverse habitat management methods on population dynamics and (4) find way(s) to evaluate and minimize their potential negative impacts. Here we focus on two relict butterfly species, the <b>violet</b> <b>copper,</b> Lycaena helle, and the bog fritillary butterfly, Proclossiana eunomia. Both species inhabit alluvial humid grasslands and peatbogs in the Belgian Ardenne, and share the same hostplant, the bistort, Polygonum bistorta. Results: Field studies and experiments carried out at several sites showed that: (1) The two species have slightly different habitat requirements. L. helle thrive in the neighbourhood of forest edges and P. eunomia reproduce preferentially at places with big grass tussocks and a high density of hostplants. This can be better understood and described with reference to the resources used by the species in the ecological space and time (Dennis, Shreeve & Van Dyck 2003). (2) Natural afforestation of these species habitats is prevented by mowing (traditional way o...|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{preservation}} and restoration are crucial for species conservation and to tackle its main challenges. In many cases, this implies management actions, especially for seminatural ecosystems. We address here {{the question of}} management actions suitable for maintaining viable populations of two relict butterfly species inhabiting wet meadows and peat bogs in the Belgian Ardenne: the bog fritillary Proclossiana eunomia and the <b>violet</b> <b>copper</b> Lycaena helle. Habitat loss due to natural vegetation succession towards forest can be prevented either by mowing (traditional way of management) or by extensive grazing (with cattle or horses). Results from field studies and experiments conducted on several sites in the Belgian Ardenne led to two conclusions. Mowing can strongly affect the populations of both species, the impact being particularly pronounced on larval stages due to the removal of grass tussocks and the export of hay containing host plant on which caterpillars feed. Grazing also has {{a negative effect on}} both species, with adult density being lower on grazed biotopes compared to abandoned ones. However, the negative impact is more limited for grazing than for mowing. As both management methods have more or less pronounced negative impacts on populations of these two butterfly species, they should be applied with caution. We suggest that mowing should be applied in long-term rotation, with the preservation of sufficient refuge areas every year, and that grazing should be applied in late summer, every other year, with a low stocking rate (< 0. 2 LU/ha/year). More particularly, to ensure their effectiveness in maintaining a favorable state, both the biotope and the associated populations using it as their habitat, managementactions must be designed according to the species habitat requirements, and adapted to carefully monitor their implementatio...|$|E
40|$|Global {{change may}} {{strongly}} affect the geographic distribution of species and induce local extinctions of populations. These changes {{are expected to}} induce a loss of intraspecific genetic diversity that may, in turn, induce {{a decrease in the}} adaptation potential of the species under changing environmental conditions. Species with limited dispersal abilities, narrow habitat requirements and geographically restricted and isolated distribution patterns, such as the <b>Violet</b> <b>Copper</b> butterfly Lycaena helle, are particularly threatened. It is therefore important to evaluate the amount of intraspecific genetic diversity that can be lost in the future to guide proactive conservation strategies able to preserve the adaptation potential of L. helle. The restriction of these populations to high-elevation exclaves has led to the evolution of unique morphological and genetic entities, mostly restricted to single mountain massifs. In this study, we examine how future climate and land use changes in Europe are expected to induce range shifts and range contraction in L. helle and how these changes may cause extinction of populations and loss of intraspecific genetic uniqueness. We jointly used a species distribution modelling approach and a comprehensive microsatellite dataset to identify the populations of L. helle with unique alleles that are expected to be the most threatened with extinction under future global change. We have estimated population extinction and loss of genetic uniqueness under two dispersal assumptions: no dispersal and limited dispersal. Our results indicate that up to half of the currently known populations of L. helle are predicted to become extinct by 2080 under the most severe global change scenario. As a consequence, up to one third of the genetic uniqueness is predicted to be lost in Europe. We found considerable variation in the loss of genetic uniqueness depending on the scenarios used in the projections and on the dispersal assumptions. We suggest that proactive conservation measures should focus on a small number of mountain massifs (e. g. Alps, Jura and Massif Central) {{in order to maintain the}} genetic uniqueness of L. helle in the future. Our results also highlight the importance of promoting the dispersal of L. helle in the future through the management of well-connected networks of suitable habitats...|$|E
