5|$|Several other <b>Venus</b> flybys {{took place}} in the 1980s and 1990s that {{increased}} the understanding of <b>Venus,</b> including Vega 1 (1985), Vega 2 (1985), Galileo (1990), Magellan (1994), Cassini–Huygens (1998), and MESSENGER (2006). Then, <b>Venus</b> Express by the European Space Agency (ESA) entered orbit around <b>Venus</b> in April 2006. Equipped with seven scientific instruments, <b>Venus</b> Express provided unprecedented long-term observation of Venus's atmosphere. ESA concluded that mission in December 2014.|$|E
5|$|The first vortex on <b>Venus</b> was {{discovered}} {{at the north}} pole by the Pioneer <b>Venus</b> mission in 1978. A discovery of the second large 'double-eyed' vortex {{at the south pole}} of <b>Venus</b> was made in the summer of 2006 by <b>Venus</b> Express, which came with no surprise.|$|E
5|$|The pentagram of <b>Venus</b> is {{the path}} that <b>Venus</b> makes as {{observed}} from Earth. Successive inferior conjunctions of <b>Venus</b> repeat very near a 13:8 orbital resonance (Earth orbits 8 times for every 13 orbits of <b>Venus),</b> shifting 144° upon sequential inferior conjunctions. The resonance 13:8 ratio is approximate. 8/13 is approximately 0.615385 while <b>Venus</b> orbits the Sun in 0.615187 years.|$|E
50|$|For example, <b>Venus's</b> year (sidereal period) is 225 days, and Earth's is 365 days. Thus <b>Venus's</b> synodic period, {{which gives}} the time between two {{subsequent}} eastern (or western) greatest elongations, is 584 days.|$|R

5|$|The {{speculation}} of {{the existence}} of life on <b>Venus</b> decreased significantly since the early 1960s, when spacecraft began studying <b>Venus</b> and {{it became clear that the}} conditions on <b>Venus</b> are extreme compared to those on Earth.|$|E
5|$|<b>Venus</b> {{also has}} no moons, though {{reports of a}} moon around <b>Venus</b> have {{circulated}} since the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|A transit of <b>Venus</b> {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet <b>Venus</b> passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk. During a transit, <b>Venus</b> {{can be seen from}} Earth as a small black disk moving across the face of the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of <b>Venus</b> is more than 3 times that of the Moon, <b>Venus</b> appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the face of the Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, Venera 4 found <b>Venus's</b> {{magnetic}} field {{to be much}} weaker than that of Earth. This {{magnetic field}} is induced by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind, rather than by an internal dynamo as in the Earth's core. <b>Venus's</b> small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation.|$|R

Research also recorded its radical temperature variations between night and day.|$|R

Angered, <b>Venus</b> punished the mother by cursing Smyrna {{to fall in love}} with her father. After the nurse had prevented Smyrna from committing suicide, she helped her engage her father in sexual intercourse. When Smyrna became pregnant, she hid in the woods from shame. <b>Venus</b> pitied the girl's fate, changing her into a myrrh tree, from which was born Adonis.|$|E

5|$|Numerous works, {{from the}} ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of {{inspiration}} for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping <b>Venus</b> (c. 1510) and Titian's <b>Venus</b> of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She {{is often described as}} looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the <b>Venus</b> effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of <b>Venus</b> turned away from the observer of the painting.|$|E
5|$|Observation {{made of the}} {{atmosphere}} of <b>Venus</b> simultaneously from Earth-based telescopes and from the <b>Venus</b> Express gives scientists a better opportunity to understand the intermediate level of Venus's atmosphere than is possible from either viewpoint alone.

40|$|On 15 August 1994 we {{launched}} the EUVS sounding rocket payload {{to observe the}} 825 - 1110 angstrom region of <b>Venus's</b> far ultraviolet airglow spectrum. The EUVS telescope/spectrograph obtained good data at five times higher spectral resolution than was previously available in the far ultraviolet. We present these data and compare our results to those obtained by the Galileo UVS and Venera 11 / 12 UV spectrophotometers. We identify several new spectral emission features, including both singly ionized nitrogen and molecular nitrogen in <b>Venus's</b> spectrum. We also see evidence for electron-impact-induced emission from CO. Finally, the EUVS data indicate that the "Ar" emissions detected in <b>Venus's</b> far ultraviolet spectrum by Venera 11 / 12 spectrophotometers are in fact not due to argon, thus eliminating the discrepancy between in situ and remote sensing measurements...|$|R

Art historian Sarah Burnage believes Etty's choice of <b>Venus</b> and her Satellites may have been {{to draw attention to}} similarities with Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball and possibly to link the Williams-Wynn sisters' beauty with the legendary <b>Venus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sequences of transits usually repeat every 243 years. After {{this period}} of time <b>Venus</b> and Earth have {{returned}} to very nearly the same point in their respective orbits. During the Earth's 243 sidereal orbital periods, which total 88,757.3 days, <b>Venus</b> completes 395 sidereal orbital periods of 224.701 days each, equal to 88,756.9 Earth days. This period of time corresponds to 152 synodic periods of <b>Venus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} point to ongoing volcanic activity on <b>Venus.</b> During the Soviet Venera program, the Venera 9 orbiter obtained spectroscopic evidence of lightning on <b>Venus,</b> and the Venera 12 descent probe obtained additional evidence of lightning and thunder. The European Space Agency's <b>Venus</b> Express in 2007 detected whistler waves further confirming {{the occurrence of}} lightning on <b>Venus.</b> One possibility is that ash from a volcanic eruption was generating the lightning. Another piece of evidence comes from measurements of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which dropped {{by a factor of}} 10 between 1978 and 1986, jumped in 2006, and again declined 10-fold. This may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions.|$|E
