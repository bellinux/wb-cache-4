5|$|Police Squads opening {{sequence}} {{was based}} on the 1950s show M Squad, which starred Lee Marvin, which opened with footage of a police car roving through a dark urban setting with a big band playing a jazz song in the background. The Hank Simms <b>voice-over</b> <b>and</b> the show's organization into acts with an epilogue was homage to Quinn Martin police dramas including The Fugitive, The Streets of San Francisco, Barnaby Jones, The F.B.I., and Cannon. Nielsen portrayed a serious character whose one-liners appeared accidental next to the pratfalls and sight gags that were happening around him. Although the show lasted only six episodes Nielsen received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.|$|E

500|$|In 1955, Smith was {{approached}} {{to perform the}} <b>voice-over</b> <b>and</b> opening scene for the movie To Hell And Back, {{which was based on}} the autobiography of Audie Murphy. He accepted, and had small parts in the movie, most notably in the beginning, where he was dressed in his old service uniform. He narrated several parts of the movie, referring constantly to [...] "the foot soldier". Smith was portrayed on screen by Alexander Knox in The Longest Day (1962), [...] Edward Binns in Patton (1970) and Timothy Bottoms in [...] (2004).

500|$|Beginning in 1967, the {{advertising}} focused exclusively on Wonderbra brand brassieres. In 1968, Nadler hired Goodis Advertising {{to develop the}} new campaign. The Wonderbra ads were based on fashion and emotional appeal. In various ads, the man would appear as fashion photographer (in a fashion shoot) or fashion buyer (at a fashion show). The storyline suggested an attraction or budding romance between {{the man and the}} women. The <b>voice-over</b> <b>and</b> jingle featured a man's voice and the commercial showed an actual woman's torso naked except for a bra. All other television ads before this era showed brassieres on a manikin or a dressmaker's dummy to promote the functional features of the product. Every Wonderbra advertisement contained versions of the musical theme, [...] "We care about the shape you're in. Wonderful, wonderful, Wonderbra". The 1979 television campaign included a commercial directed by Richard Avedon which won a Silver award for television advertisements shown in Canada.|$|E
500|$|The {{large amount}} of footage, {{and the fact that}} the filmmakers were [...] "in a sense... looking at it for the first time", meant that the film's concept only became clear during editing. The events of 11–13April gave it [...] "a new {{dramatic}} centre", although Bartley and ÓBriain were keen that the film did not concentrate entirely on the coup. They had intended to include more historical and political context; it wasn't until late in post-production that the focus narrowed to include more emphasis on the media's role in Venezuelan politics. In October 2002, a two-hour [...] "rough cut" [...] was shown to Stoneman and Brendan McCarthy, BSÉ's head of Production and Development. This version included the [...] "witness" [...] accounts that Bartley and ÓBriain had captured after April 2002. Stoneman felt that these sequences reinforced the film's claims, but [...] "diluted its originality". He argued that they be cut, and that to compensate, Bartley and ÓBriain should record a <b>voice-over</b> <b>and</b> place themselves more in the frame as witness-protagonists, ideas that the filmmakers initially resisted.|$|E

500|$|Gordon and Silver {{moved the}} project to Warner Bros., where Terry Gilliam was {{attached}} to direct. Unsatisfied with how Hamm's script fleshed out the characters, Gilliam brought in Charles McKeown to rewrite it. The second draft, which was credited to Gilliam, Warren Skaaren, and Hamm rather than McKeown, used the character Rorschach's journal as a <b>voice-over,</b> <b>and</b> restored scenes from the comic book that Hamm had removed. According to Watchmen artist Dave Gibbons, filming was to take place at Pinewood Studios. Silver wanted to cast Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dr. Manhattan. Because both Gilliam and Silver's previous films, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen and Die Hard 2 respectively, went over budget, they were only able to raise $25 million for the film—a quarter of the necessary budget. As a result, Gilliam abandoned the project, and ultimately decided that Watchmen was unfilmable. Gilliam explained, [...] "Reducing [...] to a two or two-and-a-half hour film [...] {{seemed to me to}} take away the essence of what Watchmen is about." [...] When Warner Bros. dropped the project, Gordon invited Gilliam back to helm the film independently. The director again declined, believing that the comic book would be better directed as a five-hour miniseries.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} attempts {{to make a film}} version of Watchmen since 1986, when producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver acquired film rights to the series for 20th Century Fox. Fox asked Alan Moore to write a screenplay based on his story, but he declined, so the studio enlisted screenwriter Sam Hamm. Hamm took the liberty of re-writing Watchmens complicated ending into a [...] "more manageable" [...] conclusion involving an assassination and a time paradox. Fox put the project into turnaround in 1991, and the project was moved to Warner Bros., where Terry Gilliam was attached to direct and Charles McKeown to rewrite it. They used the character Rorschach's diary as a <b>voice-over</b> <b>and</b> restored scenes from the comic book that Hamm had removed. Gilliam and Silver were only able to raise $25 million for the film (a quarter of the necessary budget) because their previous films had gone over budget.

500|$|Following {{an advance}} {{screening}} at CinemaCon on April 22, 2015, {{the film was}} well received by audiences. Praise was aimed for its smart storyline, although some wondered whether the concept was too complicated for young audiences and to attract family crowds. After premiering at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, the film attracted praise from film critics. Peter Debruge of Variety was effusive, calling it the studio's [...] "greatest idea" [...] and [...] "a stunningly original concept that [...] promises to forever change the way people think about the way people think." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips called it the studio's best since Up (also directed by Docter), a [...] "consistently inventive and a heartening corrective to recent, stockholder-driven inferiorities." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter deemed it an [...] "audacious concept" [...] that stands among the most [...] "conceptually trippy films" [...] for family audiences. [...] "With its quite literally cerebral bent, I think Inside Out might have some trouble fully connecting with younger kids, but grown-ups are likely to shed {{more than a few}} tears," [...] remarked Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair. The Guardians Peter Bradshaw felt it [...] "buoyant and sweet-natured," [...] though slightly inferior to Pixar's best. Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club, while overall positive on the film, said it [...] "trades the wordless gracefulness and sense of discovery of the animation studio's best work for explanatory <b>voice-over</b> <b>and</b> nonstop exposition," [...] also arguing that the Pixar animators could have been more visually adventurous to match the conceptual ambition.|$|E

500|$|The car chase {{scene with}} Snake is a {{reference}} to the car chase scene in the 1968 film Bullitt. Music similar to the soundtrack of the television series The Streets of San Francisco is heard in the scene. Alf Clausen, a composer on The Simpsons who had previously worked on several police shows, wrote the music for the scene. In another reference to The Streets of San Francisco and other Quinn Martin productions, a <b>voice-over</b> <b>and</b> caption proclaims the name of act two of the episode, [...] "Act II - Death Drives a Stick", after the episode's first act break {{in the middle of the}} Snake car chase. In the sequence where Bart imagines himself testifying in court, his face is obscured with a blue dot; this is a references to the television coverage of the rape trial of William Kennedy Smith, in which the woman who accused Smith of raping her was obscured with a blue dot over her face. The way the scene changes from Bart and Skinner talking in Skinner's office to them searching through the lockers is {{a reference to}} the same style of scene change used in the 1960s Batman television series, in which a close-up of Batman's face with dramatic music in the background is shown for a brief moment before the scene changes. The song heard when Bart and Skinner search through the lockers for the Teachers' Editions is a variation of Harold Faltermeyer’s [...] "Axel F" [...] from the film Beverly Hills Cop.|$|E

2500|$|After Salinger's {{death in}} 2010, Phyllis Westberg, who was Salinger's agent at Harold Ober Associates, stated that {{nothing has changed}} in terms of {{licensing}} film, television, or stage rights of his works. A letter written by Salinger in 1957 revealed that he was open to an adaptation of The Catcher in the Rye released after his death. He wrote: [...] "Firstly, {{it is possible that}} one day the rights will be sold. Since there's an ever-looming possibility that I won't die rich, I toy very seriously with the idea of leaving the unsold rights to my wife and daughter as a kind of insurance policy. It pleasures me no end, though, I might quickly add, to know that I won't have to see the results of the transaction." [...] Salinger also wrote that he believed his novel was not suitable for film treatment, and that translating Holden Caulfield's first-person narrative into <b>voice-over</b> <b>and</b> dialogue would be contrived.|$|E

2500|$|After one filmed series (of 26 episodes) {{in black}} and white, The Avengers began filming in colour for the fifth series in 1966. It was three years before Britain's ITV network began full colour {{broadcast}}ing. The first 16 episodes of this series were broadcast concurrently in the U.S., in colour, and the UK, {{in black and}} white, from January to May 1967. Eight further episodes were broadcast in the UK beginning in late September, while these episodes were withheld in the U.S. until early 1968, {{where they would be}} immediately succeeded by the first batch of episodes featuring Diana Rigg's replacement, Linda Thorson. The American prologue of the fourth series was rejigged for the colour episodes. It opened with the caption The Avengers In Color (required by ABC for colour series at that time). This was followed by Steed unwrapping the foil from a champagne bottle and Peel shooting the cork away. Unlike the [...] "chessboard" [...] opening of the previous series, this new prologue had no narrative <b>voice-over,</b> <b>and</b> the scene was also included in UK broadcasts of the series.|$|E
2500|$|After graduating {{high school}} in 2008, she {{attended}} California State Polytechnic University, Pomona where she intended to major in graphic design. During her freshman year, she looked up some online forums regarding <b>voice-over</b> <b>and</b> attended Anime Expo, where she learned about and attended an Adventures in Voice Acting workshop conducted by Tony Oliver. On Oliver's suggestion that she was pretty good at it, she changed her major to theatre, [...] and continued to take voice acting lessons and workshops while studying at school. She also did a production internship at Bang Zoom! Entertainment where she got to sit in {{on some of the}} recording sessions. Her first voice acting project was on K-On! where she voiced some incidental characters. Her first big voice-over role was for Battleship, based on the movie of the same name, where she got to voice a main character among many veteran voice actors. However, video game reviewers panned the game because none of the movie's actors reprised their roles in the game, and faulted the game's limited acting, which was relegated to mostly radio chatter and mission updates. At one point in college, she had some health issues that led her to take an absence from school and acting, so she pursued production work, which her parents thought would make for a more practical career; she later dropped it as she was encouraged by Oliver to pursue acting and to finish school. That was when she landed the lead role as Ayesha in the video game [...] She described Ayesha as a bit airheaded and ditsy but relatable and resembles her personality at times. [...] Video game reviewer Sean Madson of Diehardgamefan found the dub to be of decent quality, but said Ayesha [...] "sounded a bit too obnoxious with her airheadedness." [...] Matt Sainsbury of Digitally Downloaded thought the dub was reasonable but disliked their American accents as not suiting the Japanese personality of the game. [...] Vince Ingenito of IGN wrote that [...] "both the writing and voice acting fail to lend any weight to her plight. Ayesha seems about as upset over her missing sister as I might be over a glass of spilled milk, making it really hard to care about the outcome of her quest." [...] Harlacher also voiced Sadira, a spider-themed woman and new character to the Killer Instinct series.|$|E
