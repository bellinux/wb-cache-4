40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{the impact of}} both radio traffic {{information}} and <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> information on route choice behaviour. The empirical analysis {{is based on an}} extensive survey held among road users in the Amsterdam corridor in July 1994. The data is stemming from the EC DRIVE II project BATT. To analyse the factors that influence route choice behaviour, several types of discrete choice models (ordered probit, multiple logit and bivariate ordered probit) have been estimated. Bivariate models are needed to model the (endogenous) dependency of the use of radio traffic information and <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> information. The results confirm earlier findings that women {{are less likely to be}} influenced by traffic information. New is the finding that commuters are less likely to be influenced, and that the level of satisfaction with alternative routes is strongly related to the type and distance of the alternative road. The analysis also reveals that the impacts of radio traffic information and <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> information on route choice behaviour are very similar, and that route choice adaptations based on radio traffic information are positively related to route choice adaptations based on <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> information. An interesting issue is the willingness-to-pay for having in-vehicle dynamic traffic information. As expected, the willingness-to-pay is relatively large for male drivers on business trips. Another important new finding is that the results suggest that there is a positive correlation between the use of radio traffic information and <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> information. ...|$|R

40|$|Researches {{indicate}} that foggy weather {{is one of}} the most critical factors that restrict human&# 39;s traffic activities and cause traffic accidents. It will reduce the visibility of traffic message board, which could cause the insecurity of transportation. Commonly, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were used as light source for <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign,</b> which could not be seen clearly in the foggy low visibility condition. A high-brightness light source which could be used for variable information board was firstly put forward in this paper. And a new type of <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> used in low visibility condition was also introduced. Besides, the attenuation characteristics of laser diode (LD) and light-emitting diode (LED) were analyzed respectively. Calculation and simulation show that the attenuation of red light source is fastest, and the yellow LED light has the better transmittance property. In the experiment, LDs were used to make <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> board for verifying image definition. A 16 ∗ 16 array structure composed of LDs was designed and could display Chinese characters. By comparing the display effect of LDs and LEDs driven with same power, they were placed in fog chamber of the visibility less than 5 meters. And experiment results show that the penetrability of red LD light is better than that of red LED. So traffic <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> based on LDs could improve the image definition and the information could be seen more clearly in the foggy weather. In addition to the high-brightness, good coherence, good direction, experimental results show that traffic <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> board based on LD has better visual effect in low visibility condition. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.
