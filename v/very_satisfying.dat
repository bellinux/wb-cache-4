5|$|Lindqvist {{had insisted}} on writing the {{screenplay}} himself. Alfredson, who had no familiarity with the vampire and horror genres, initially expressed skepticism at having the original author do the adaptation, but found the end result <b>very</b> <b>satisfying.</b> Many of the minor characters and events from the book were removed, and focus directed primarily on the love story between the two leads. In particular, {{many aspects of the}} character Håkan, including him being a paedophile, were toned down, and his relationship with Eli was mostly left open to interpretation. Alfredson felt that the film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a satisfying manner, and that this element would detract from the story of the children and their relationship. Still, the film provided a few hints, of which Alfredson mentions one in the director's comments (Håkan likes children, for the wrong reasons).|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{improved}} {{statistics in}} 1998, {{the following year}} was entirely frustrating for Chapman, who found himself confined to the second team all season having been plagued with a persistent elbow injury. In 2000, following the arrival of Glenn McGrath he left Worcestershire and moved counties again, this time to the minor county of Lincolnshire under the captaincy of another former Notts player, Mark Fell. Here he found rather more success, taking 4–18 against Berkshire {{in the first round}} of the 2002 C Trophy (actually played, due to the vagaries of the fixture list, in August 2001), and making his first ever List A half-century when in the same competition in 2003 he hit what, even though Lincolnshire lost the game, must have been a <b>very</b> <b>satisfying</b> unbeaten 53 against Nottinghamshire.|$|E
25|$|In later works {{painted by}} the workshop, the {{drawings}} are often painfully {{more attractive than}} the paintings. Most Raphael drawings are rather precise—even initial sketches with naked outline figures are carefully drawn, and later working drawings often have {{a high degree of}} finish, with shading and sometimes highlights in white. They lack the freedom and energy of some of Leonardo's and Michelangelo's sketches, but are nearly always aesthetically <b>very</b> <b>satisfying.</b> He {{was one of the last}} artists to use metalpoint (literally a sharp pointed piece of silver or another metal) extensively, although he also made superb use of the freer medium of red or black chalk. In his final years he was one of the first artists to use female models for preparatory drawings—male pupils ("garzoni") were normally used for studies of both sexes.|$|E
25|$|A set {{of similar}} paradoxes occurs within {{the area of}} physics {{involving}} arrow of time and causality. One of these, the grandfather paradox, deals with the peculiar nature of causality in closed time-like loops. In its most crude conception, the paradox involves a person traveling {{back in time and}} murdering an ancestor who hadn't yet had a chance to procreate. The speculative nature of time travel to the past means that there is no agreed upon resolution to the paradox, nor is it even clear that there are physically possible solutions to the Einstein equations that would allow for the conditions required for the paradox to be met. Nevertheless, there are two common explanations for possible resolutions for this paradox that take on similar flavor for the explanations of quantum mechanical paradoxes. In the so-called self-consistent solution, reality is constructed {{in such a way as}} to deterministically prevent such paradoxes from occurring. This idea makes many free will advocates uncomfortable, though it is <b>very</b> <b>satisfying</b> to many philosophical naturalists. Alternatively, the many worlds idealization or the concept of parallel universes is sometimes conjectured to allow for a continual fracturing of possible worldlines into many different alternative realities. This would mean that any person who traveled back in time would necessarily enter a different parallel universe that would have a different history from the point of the time travel forward.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{received}} generally negative reviews, with Variety {{saying it}} [...] "plays implausibly on screen, especially since Jordan Alan has no feel for authentic texture or volatility within the crime genre", The Hollywood Reporter calling it [...] "minimal entertainment {{with nothing to}} recommend it," [...] and New Times finding it [...] "tedious, poorly acted and predictable."

Club, {{who gave}} the episode a B+ grade, said it was [...] "long on pathos and awkwardness but short on laughs", but {{described}} it as [...] "a <b>very</b> <b>satisfying</b> way to end a <b>very</b> <b>satisfying</b> season". Although Rabin said the final scene with Jim and Pam was filmed and handled artfully, he also {{expressed concern that the}} subplot could turn into a cliched device, and said [...] "part of me felt it was a rather pat, heavy-handed way of ending the season on a dramatic note." [...] Will Leitch of New York magazine expressed concern about the dangers of television shows adding a pregnancy subplot, but said of the episode, [...] "For now, we’ll bask in the happiness of two main characters who have waited a long time for it." [...] Leitch, who called Holly the show's [...] "most beloved guest star", also complimented the way the episode handled Michael and Holly's brief reunion: [...] "The couple and the producers seem to have come to the same conclusion about this relationship: Holly (Amy Ryan) can’t actually stay with Michael (Steve Carell), so let’s just enjoy her while she’s here." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN complimented the episode but said it [...] "doesn't really reach that high", which he said was disappointing following a string of eventful episodes. He praised the Holly character and the way Jim and Dwight worked so well together during the volleyball game, and although he said the final scene was a nice moment between Jim and Pam, he also said the twist was [...] "predictable and telegraphed".|$|E
500|$|Playing {{within the}} {{universe}} of The Lord of the Rings was appealing {{to a number of}} reviewers, which found that it generally increased the game's entertainment value. PC Gamer shared this sentiment, calling Lord of the Rings [...] "arguably the best fantasy universe ever", and GameZone asked the question, [...] "What self-respecting Tolkien fan can be without this title?" [...] The results also pleased 1UP.com, which was convinced that fans of The Lord of the Rings could not afford to miss purchasing the game. Game Revolution complimented the game's merge with the Lord of the Rings universe, observing that the franchise's mythology and the game's frenetic battles came together in a <b>very</b> <b>satisfying</b> bundle. The integration of The Lord of the Rings into a video game satisfied Game Informer, and the magazine predicted the game would be [...] "another winner for Electronic Arts".|$|E

Two big lords of the realm fell while a new Iron Island {{character}} was introduced and a character we all worried about got brought back to life by an unsure-but-well-meaning priestess. Story flowed here like wine in a <b>very</b> <b>satisfying</b> chapter filled with death and resurrection." [...] Fowler gave the episode a 9.3 out of 10. Reviewing for The A.V.

McNutt also wrote about the showrunners going back to yet to be used story lines from the books, and transposing them into later seasons, such as the Kingsmoot plot, noting [...] "It's a great example of the show's ability to adapt the books in a non-linear fashion, here wholesale moving a storyline where it serves a clearer purpose." ...|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{columnist for}} The Star-Ledger {{called it a}} [...] "balls to the wall, gut-busting, amazing Office episode", and called the fire opening scene [...] "not only the best Office pre-credits sequence ever, but an all-time sitcom classic". Sepinwall said [...] "Stress Relief" [...] was accessible to newcomers and regular viewers, and displayed both the comedic and human sides of the characters. He said the only drawback of the episode was the Mrs. Albert Hannaday subplot, which he felt was an unnecessary gimmick added solely to accommodate the guest stars. TV Guide writer Shahzad Abbas wrote, [...] "This {{was one of my}} favorite episodes ever. It had me laughing the whole way through." [...] Abbas particularly praised the fire opening scene and the final scene in which Michael insults everybody, which he called [...] "a <b>very</b> <b>satisfying</b> ending to the roast saga". He called the Black/Leachman romance [...] "creepy and hilarious", but described the Jim and Pam romance subplot as the weak link of the episode.|$|E
500|$|The main {{character}} {{of the novel is}} James Bond. Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson described Amis's Bond as a humourless interpretation of the character that Fleming used in his earlier novels. Benson describes this personality as a natural continuation of the Bond developed in the final three Fleming novels. In all three novels, the events take a toll on Bond: he loses his wife in On Her Majesty's Secret Service; he loses his memory in Japan in You Only Live Twice; and he is brainwashed in Russia, is de-programmed by MI6 and almost dies from Francisco Scaramanga's poisoned bullet in The Man with the Golden Gun. Benson identifies Bond's desire for revenge as a central theme to the novel. The plot centres on Bond's need to avenge the death of the Hammonds and M's kidnapping. Benson describes this as particularly striking: [...] "Bond is particularly brutal in achieving his goal... The revenge is <b>very</b> <b>satisfying.</b> This is Bond at his toughest." ...|$|E

[...] "An instrumental {{has to be}} real catchy and when you succeed it's <b>very</b> <b>satisfying</b> because you have transcended words and communicated with emotion," [...] said Betts. The song takes on a decidedly gospel flair midway through, accentuated by [...] "old-fashioned church-like hand clapping." [...] The Gregg Allman-penned [...] "Don't Keep Me Wonderin'" [...] follows, featuring Duane on slide guitar and Oakley's friend Thom Doucette on harmonica. [...] "Midnight Rider" [...] developed quickly and featured lyrics contributed by roadie Robert Payne, who threw out a suggestion to Gregg Allman while together at their equipment warehouse. Unable to gain {{a key to the}} nearby Capricorn Sound Studios, the duo broke in and recorded a quick demo with Twiggs Lyndon on bass and Johanson on congas.

500|$|Celia Larkin, {{writing on}} 12 February 2012 in the Irish Sunday Independent, said [...] "There was {{something}} <b>very</b> <b>satisfying</b> about Heather Mills finally having her voice heard above {{the roar of}} the Red Tops. If you actually take the time to listen to Mills, I mean listen, not just read what's written about her, you'll see she is a strong, sincere, independent woman. She didn't lie down under the weight of McCartney's fame and wealth, she continued to plough her own furrow, campaigning for her charities, maintaining a strong individuality. And that, it seems, is the greatest sin of all. Is it any wonder she was reduced to tears in the October 2007 GMTV interview? Did we feel sympathy for her then? No. 'Heather Mills has Melt Down' screamed the headlines, so now she had lost her marbles to boot. And if that wasn't enough, Carole Malone of the Sunday Mirror, one of the papers that was relentless in its attacks on Mills, accused her of staging an act on live TV in order to further her cause in the upcoming divorce hearing.

[...] Ramsey Isler of IGN reiterated his own enjoyment of the premise {{of the episode}}, but went on to state, [...] "While I can appreciate the point that good comedy does take a certain degree of wit and cleverness, this just wasn't a <b>very</b> <b>satisfying</b> end to an idea that had so much potential." [...] In a much more positive review, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the underuse of cutaways, going on to note, [...] "Reducing the reliance on cutaways seems to be the continuing trend for the series, and I think it's a good move [...] It forces smarter writing, and creates a better narrative structure." ...|$|E

The tours were so popular and financially successful that they determined Presley's workload for the remainder of his life and career. Parker's main role during these tours was to plan the logistics and make sure tickets were sold. He would usually fly ahead to the venues and prepare the way for Presley's entourage to follow. Due to this, Presley and Parker would very rarely see each other, and as time progressed it became even more difficult for Parker to get in contact with Presley. These live performances, as well as being <b>very</b> financially <b>satisfying,</b> also allowed Parker to fulfill Presley's recording contract with RCA.

He liked the game's third-person view more than the top-down view, saying that being able to view the sky made environments feel more complicated, and praised the high difficulty of boss battles, which task players to manage their stamina carefully. His conclusion was that Origins [...] "feels like a real throwback to the good old days of PC role-playing epics." [...] VanOrd said that the combat system was easily recognizable for players who have played other RPGs developed by BioWare. He added that players can have a lot of fun switching between characters, and agreed that the game had created thrilling boss battles. He praised the choice to have health and stamina replenish immediately after battles, as it sped up combat pace and flow. Tan also commended the combat, finding it a better system than other BioWare RPGs, but disliked the fact that characters can't step into water. Juba praised the amount of space for players to experiment with new skills and abilities, adding that the required focus and attention make combat <b>very</b> <b>satisfying.</b>|$|E

Then he played me some backing-tracks he'd done for what was to become Accident of Birth down the phone and I thought 'There is something there.'" [...] Former Iron Maiden guitarist, Adrian Smith, was asked to guest on the record, but remained as a full-time member of Dickinson's solo outfit. The album marked a return to heavy metal for Dickinson, with Sputnikmusic remarking, [...] "The album's heavy feel is <b>very</b> <b>satisfying,</b> and definitely fills that void left by Maiden during the 90's." [...] The follow-up, The Chemical Wedding, was a semi-concept album on alchemy, which drew inspiration from William Blake's writings; with some songs, such as [...] "Book of Thel", having the same title as some of his poems, and the cover artwork featuring one of his paintings.
