Therefore in 2009 first PTR-MS instruments were presented, which are capable of switching between H3O+ and O2+ (and NO+) as reagent ions. This enhances the number of detectable substances to important compounds like ethylene, acetylene, most halocarbons, etc. In 2012 a PTR-MS instrument was introduced which extends the selectable reagent ions to Kr+ and Xe+; this should allow {{for the detection of}} nearly all possible substances (up to the ionization energy of krypton (14 eV)).

Input parameters for the e-cloud {{depend on the}} shape of the vacuum chamber and surface properties. Beam induced electron multipacting in the vacuum chamber causes the electron stimulated gas desorption and may require modification of the vacuum system to deal with it.

Three parameters of e-cloud were varied in turn: photo-electron emission, secondary electron yield and gas pressure. It was found that all three parameters should not exceed a certain value to keep the e-cloud density down to an acceptable level. The energy and intensity of electron bombardment of the vacuum chamber walls and electron stimulated gas desorption were also calculated.

The pumping system we present is properly matched to the gas loads presently understood to exist in MECO. Pump down of each vacuum volume from atmosphere to below 310 − torr is computed to take place within 26 minutes, and reach 10 - 4 torr at the production solenoid in less than 30 minutes & the detector solenoid within ten hours. These times can be achieved with two 16 inch diameter ducts at the down stream end of the Detector Solenoid, with pumps located between the iron return yoke and concrete shielding blocks, and one similar 16 inch duct on the upstream end of the Production Solenoid, leading to pumps on the concrete shielding roof.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to: (1) Explain the ALS vacuum policy and specifications for beamlines and experiment endstations. (2) Provide guidelines related to ALS vacuum policy to assist in designing beamlines which are in accordance with ALS vacuum policy. This document supersedes LSBL- 116. The Advanced Light Source is a third generation synchrotron radiation source whose beam lifetime depends {{on the quality of}} the vacuum in the storage ring and the connecting beamlines. The storage ring and most of the beamlines share a common vacuum and are operated under ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) conditions. All endstations and beamline equipment must be operated so as to avoid contamination of beamline components, and must include proper safeguards to protect the storage ring vacuum from an accidental break in the beamline or endstation vacuum systems. The primary gas load during operation is due to thermal desorption and electron/photon induced desorption of contaminants from the interior of the vacuum vessel and its components. The desorption rates are considerably higher for hydrocarbon contamination, thus considerable emphasis is placed on eliminating these sources of contaminants. All vacuum components in a beamline and endstation must meet the ALS vacuum specifications. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>design</b> of both beamlines and endstations must be approved by the ALS Beamline Review Committee (BRC) before vacuum connections to the storage ring are made. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>design</b> is first checked during the Beamline Design Review (BDR) held before construction of the beamline equipment begins. Any deviation from the ALS vacuum specifications must be approved by the BRC prior to installation of the equipment on the ALS floor. Any modification that is incorporated into a vacuum assembly without the written approval of the BRC is done at the user`s risk and may lead to rejection of the whole assembly...|$|E

40|$|Using {{modulated}} beam line-of-sight threshold ionization {{mass spectrometry}} (LOS-TIMS) we measured absolute O, O 2, and Ar densities, {{and the average}} neutral-gas temperature in an O 2 /Ar electrical discharge {{as a function of}} pressure in the plasma chamber and the mole fraction of Ar in O 2; the pressure and mole fraction range was 25 – 200 mTorr and 0 – 0. 90, respectively. Although LOS-TIMS is a versatile tool for measuring absolute radical densities, it requires careful <b>vacuum</b> <b>design</b> and calibration to account for various sources of error such as the contribution to the quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) ion current from the background gases, the ion mass-to-charge ratio dependent sensitivity of the various QMS components, and space-charge limitations in the QMS ionizer. In addition, collisions within the molecular beam extracted from the discharge {{must be taken into account}} particularly for higher plasma chamber pressures (2 ̆ 6 gt; 75 mTorr). In our measurements, these effects are carefully considered and the consequences of ignoring them are discussed. The O atom density increases with pressure and O 2 mole fraction in the feed gas and is in the range of 2. 1 × 1018 – 2. 6 × 1019 m– 3.

40|$|The MAX II and MAX III {{synchrotron}} light sources at MAX-lab provide {{synchrotron radiation}} for experiments {{in a wide}} variety of research fields. The synchrotron radiation is emitted by ultra-relativistic electrons circulating in electron storage rings. In this thesis the transverse and longitudinal electron beam sizes and the electron beam lifetime limitations in electron storage rings are discussed and the methods used at MAX-lab to measure them are described. The thesis describes how measurements of the electron beam sizes and lifetimes were used to investigate and improve the performance of MAX III and to evaluate a change in the MAX II vacuum system. MAX II was the first synchrotron light source to install nonevaporable getter (NEG) -coated dipole vacuum chambers. They were installed in order to test the feasibility of the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring <b>vacuum</b> <b>design,</b> where NEG-coated dipole chambers are an integral part of the design. From measurements of the lifetime limitations in MAX II it was concluded that NEG-coated dipole vacuum chambers do not appear to have any negative impact on the performance and operation of a synchrotron light source. A diagnostic beam line was designed and installed in MAX III in order to determine the transverse electron beam profile. The performance of the beam line was investigated by conducting a series of measurements at different beam line settings. There was good agreement between the determined beam sizes for the different settings. The diagnostic beam line was used to determine the horizontal and vertical dispersion and emittance in MAX III at low currents, and an increase in the momentum spread from longitudinal instabilities at higher currents. By adding a second passive Landau cavity to the MAX III radio frequency (RF) system the instabilities were damped in the main window of operation. Measurements of the longitudinal beam size and the induced voltages in the passive cavities agreed well with computer simulations of the triple RF system of MAX III. At high Landau cavity voltages a stable overstretched bunch shape with two regions of phase stability was observed. The lifetime limitations and acceptances in MAX III were determined and the location of a horizontal aperture restriction was identified. Removing the aperture restriction increased the lifetime in MAX III by a factor of two...|$|E
