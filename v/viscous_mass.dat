Although the characteristics of independent waves of these two types are known, the knowledge of their individual contributions in dynamic response of saturated soils is limited. In this paper, a study is presented for a boundary value problem to quantitatively compute the individual contributions of these two waves. The problem corresponds to a water-saturated soil column subjected to steady-state vertical vibration at the base. The two-phase behaviour of soil {{is represented by the}} complete Biot's theory, which accounts for both <b>viscous</b> and <b>mass</b> couplings as well as the compressibility of constituents. A separation analysis procedure is presented which makes it possible to rigorously derive various responses such as displacement, total stress, pore pressure and relative fluid flow velocity in terms of the individual parts due respectively to the two compression waves. Numerical results are given to illustrate the behaviour of individual parts as affected by <b>viscous</b> coupling, <b>mass</b> coupling as well as loading frequency...|$|R

50|$|Little {{was known}} about the {{reproductive}} biology of deep-water sea urchins, therefore a study was undertaken using Aspidodiadema jacobyi as a model. This species is dioecious with individuals being either male or female. Mature individuals were gathered during the spring {{on a number of}} occasions spanning several years. They were collected in the Bahamas by suction at depths of 500 to 750 m and were kept in containers in the laboratory. Attempts were made to initiate spawning but these were successful on only two occasions. The eggs measured 94-100μm and had a yolk so that newly hatched larvae do not need to feed at first. It was suggested that in the open sea this would allow the larvae to disperse in ocean currents, surviving in cold waters where little food is available. Alternatively, another study found that the eggs are surrounded by mucous through which the sperm, which have unusually elongated heads, must penetrate. The eggs clump together and may adhere in a <b>viscous</b> <b>mass</b> to the adult's spines and be brooded there. The sperm also form a mucous mass, and it may be that a form of pseudo-copulation takes place with the pressing together of the gamete masses of adjacent individuals.In the laboratory, embryos developed over a period of 5 months into echinopluteus larvae measuring over 3000μm which were fed on unicellular algae. During their early stages the larvae developed 2 and then 4 larval arms before the mouth developed at about 11 days. Three further pairs of long arms developed over the next 30 days, after which a posterior process and a ciliated ring appeared successively. At 75 days a rudimentary echinus appeared and at 116 days, podia were apparent. None of the larvae completed metamorphosis into a juvenile and it was suggested that this may have been because the process needed to be initiated by chemical stimuli that were absent in this in vitro experiment.|$|E
40|$|When the {{semantics}} of time-variant three-dimensional atmospheric data is correctly {{considered and}} described by mathematical means, {{new methods of}} efficient data compression, time interpolation, and visualization can be developed and applied. This thesis will investigate the nature of simulated <b>viscous</b> <b>masses,</b> take such a semantic approach, demonstrate its benefits, and compare its results to currently comparable solutions. Visualizing dynamic atmospheric data has its very own challenges. Mostly, large data-sets must be stored in main memory to access them quickly for interactive graphics. Fast mapping algorithms are applied to these data-sets {{in order to produce}} geometric objects for direct viewing or for the offline production of animations. All currently applied methods of data storage (arrays with high or reduced numerical accuracy) and of visualization (iso-surfaces or direct volume rendering) as well as time-interpolation (linear or higher order) have significant and well-known shortcomings. The reason for this is the fact that they do not take advantage of the specific characteristics of dynamic atmospheric data. It must be expected that correctly considering the semantics of this special class of data will lead to new and appropriate solutions. When this data is understood more as moving {{and at the same time}} dynamically changing air masses rather than as discreet and seperately treated time steps of large arrays, new algorithms can be developed that follow these approaches: - compress the data with algorithms found in the fields of image or movie compression which take a while for the compression step but are very efficient and support rapid decompression during the visualization phase - interpolate data in time for smoother animations by following moving air mass "volumes" through the atmosphere. Without applying the full simulation model with smaller increments in time, in-between time steps can be computed by considering the specifics of animated <b>viscous</b> <b>masses.</b> - visualize with regard to the three-dimensional space and the dynamic nature of the data by effectively applying modern culling methods during the data filtering and data mapping stages of the visualization pipeline. Thus, this new approach in the treatment and internal representation of the data leads to innovative new possibilities for the visualization of dynamic atmospheric data. This thesis will develop such an approach and implement prototypes of software modules for the areas listed above. The results are compared to the state of the art...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—To {{understand}} working {{features of}} a micro combustor, a computer code has been developed to study combustion of hydrogen–air mixture {{in a series of}} chambers with same shape aspect ratio but various dimensions from millimeter to micrometer level. The prepared algorithm and the computer code are capable of modeling mixture effects in different fluid flows including chemical reactions, <b>viscous</b> and <b>mass</b> diffusion effects. The effect of various heat transfer conditions at chamber wall, e. g. adiabatic wall, with heat loss and heat conduction within the wall, on the combustion is analyzed. These thermal conditions have strong effects on the combustion especially when the chamber dimension goes smaller and the ratio of surface area to volume becomes larger. Both factors, such as larger heat loss through the chamber wall and smaller chamber dimension size, may lead to the thermal quenching of micro-scale combustion. Through such systematic numerical analysis, a proper operation space for the micro-combustor is suggested, which may be used as the guideline for microcombustor design.
