40|$|In this thesis, {{hydrogen}} chloride (HCl) gas gettering of multicrystalline silicon {{for the use}} in photovoltaics is investigated. The gettering effect {{is due to the}} removal of metallic impurities {{from the surface of the}} wafers through the formation of <b>volatile</b> <b>chloride</b> compounds. This method is considered to be used as an effective purification step in the solar cell process. It could be easily integrated into the concept of the crystalline silicon thin film (cSiTF) solar cell. This concept combines two main aspects. On the one hand, it is cost saving because only a small amount of expensive high purity silicon is needed for the epitaxial deposition of a thin layer on low-cost silicon. On the other hand, the product which is called epitaxial wafer equivalent (EpiWE) can be further processed in a standard wafer cell production. However, low-cost silicon which could be used as substrate has a high amount of doping and metallic impurities which severely degrades the cell efficiency. Therefore, the amount of impurities in the substrate has to be reduced in order to prevent diffusion into the active layer. An economical and effective purification step is needed.

40|$|Coal is {{the most}} {{abundant}} fossil-fuel resource in the United States. `Clean coal` technologies, such as pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC) and integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC), require a hot gas filter to remove the corrosive and erosive coal ash entrained in the combustion gas stream. These hot gas filters, or candle filters, must be cost-effective while able to withstand the effects of corrosion, elevated temperature, thermal shock, and temperature transients. Ash loadings may range from 500 to 10, 000 ppm by weight, and may contain particles as fine as 0. 008 mils. The operating environment for the hot gas filter can range in pressure from 10 to 20 atm, in temperatures from 700 to 1750 {degrees}F, and can be oxidizing or reducing. In addition, the process gases may contain <b>volatile</b> <b>chloride,</b> sulfur, and alkali species. Field testing of various commercially available, porous, ceramic filter matrices has demonstrated a loss of up to 50 percent of as-manufactured strength after 1, 000 to 2, 000 hours of exposure to these operating conditions, although full-scale elements have remained intact during normal process operations. Ultramet, a small business specializing in advanced materials R&D, has developed {{a new class of}} hot gas filter materials that offers lower back-pressure, higher permeability, longer life, and high filtration efficiency in the PFBC and IGCC environments. Subscale Ultrafoam Duplex Filter elements have undergone accelerated corrosion testing at temperatures of up to 2370 {degrees}F (at Ultramet), and have been subjected to over 2, 800 hours of exposure to hot PFBC gases (in the Westinghouse Advanced Particulate Filtration System at Brilliant, OH) without any loss in strength in either case. The Ultrafoam Duplex Filter matrix demonstrated 100 percent particle- capture efficiency of coal ash, and had an initial pressure drop of 0. 1 to 0. 6 in-wc/fpm. The Ultrafoam Duplex Filter is composed of a chemical vapor deposition (CVD), silicon carbide (SiC), reticulated, open-cell foam filter body supporting a porous mullite membrane filter. The reticulated foam structure is 70 to 90 percent porous, enabling high permeability, while the 3 -D interconnected cellular lattice resists crack propagation. The CVD SiC material is fine-grained for maximum strength and corrosion resistance, and has no binders or impurities. The porous, mullite, membrane filter is impregnated into the outer surface of the CVD SiC Ultrafoam filter element. The membrane bonds to the foam ligaments, while the foam ligaments reinforce and support the membrane. The mullite membrane, which acts as a barrier filter, is resistant to thermal shock and corrosion. The thin membrane minimizes pressure drop and thermal gradients. The composite Ultrafoam Duplex Filter was designed to combine optimal material selection with functional structural design to maximize corrosion resistance, thermal shock resistance, strength, toughness, and life while minimizing pressure drop and weight. Oxidation rate, corrosion resistance, creep strength, compressive strength, and C-ring strength of the CVD SiC Ultrafoam filter body, and pressure drop and filtration efficiency for subscale Ultrafoam Duplex Filter elements, are reported. Future work is targeted at the construction of full-scale hot gas filters, and will include further strength and accelerated corrosion testing of subscale sections of the filter body, the membrane, and the composite duplex filter elements...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRecycling {{of steel}} in {{electric}} arc furnaces generates a flue dust known as {{electric arc furnace}} dust (EAFD). EAFD contain appreciable amount of Fe, Zn, and Pb. It is also toxic due to the heavy metal content and fine particle size. Landfilling or waste disposal of EAFD is banned in many industrialized countries. Processing of EAFDs for recovery of valuable metals such as Zn and Pb could be beneficial to both resource and environmental conservation. This paper presents the lab scale results of an innovative approach of EAFD treatment method for selective recovery of Zn and Pb and producing a residue suitable for recycling in the iron and steel industry. Chlorination of different oxide constituents of EAFD such as ZnFe 2 O 4 and Fe 2 O 3, in their pure form, was studied between 600 - 1050 oC.

The formation of an oxide layer containing two different scales was observed under oxidizing atmospheres (700 mbar H_ 2 O, N_ 2, 1200 and 1370 C, 91 - 1800 h). At the interface to SiSiC the scale was crystalline SiO_ 2 and on the outside the scale was amorphous containing Al and K. The formation of this layer was described from the literature and kinetic observations. Experiments in low p_O__ 2, atmospheres p_H_C_l= 0. 60 mbar, p_H__ 2 = 40 mbar, p_H__ 2 _O= 1 mbar, N_ 2, 1000 - 1300 C showed that SiSiC corrodes {{as a function of}} the temperature and the HCl concentration. The attack prefentially takes place on the Si phase with the formation of <b>volatile</b> <b>chlorides.</b> A significant decrease of the bending strength was correlated with this observation. The limiting values of the HCl content at which corrosion of SiSiC begins were determined. If SiSiC was covered with an amorphous oxide layer containing Al and K no attack could be observed under corrosive conditions. In all cases this layer was protective even under thermal cycling conditions (RT- 1000 C, 1 - 4 h ramp time, 42 - 168 cycles). The protective function of the oxide layer depends on its structure.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} behavior underpinning a new processing {{concept was}} demonstrated which {{is capable of}} separating uranium from zirconium in U-Zr alloys through the formation and selective volatilization of their respective chlorides. Bench-scale chlorination and volatilization experiments were conducted on uranium, zirconium, and a U- 50 wt% Zr alloy in order to gather the data needed to develop processing methods and equipment. It is also proposed that the demonstrated chlorination process may be coupled to a hydride/dehydride pulverization process, resulting in increased process efficiencies and simplified equipment design. Process variables such as temperature, pressure, surface area, and reaction time were studied in an iterative manner until the variables needed for selective volatilization were discovered. This began with the design and assembly of an experimental apparatus which was capable of surviving a hot chlorine atmosphere. It was found that standard glass test-tubes were suitable as reaction vessels for these experiments. Heated and non-heated regions were established within the glass reaction vessels to allow for volatilization and condensation of the <b>volatile</b> <b>chlorides</b> through natural convection. The volatilized and non-volatilized products were collected and analyzed using EPMA to determine the relative uranium and zirconium compositions.
