40|$|Abstract- The use {{of digital}} <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> and digital still cameras is {{becoming}} widespread. Digital <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> differ from digital still cameras {{in a number}} of respects. Digital <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> capture approximately thirty frames per second and are optimized to capture a large amount of moving images, but sacrifice image quality. Still digital cameras are less expensive because they have far less processing power and memory capacity than digital <b>video</b> <b>cameras.</b> Even with these limitations, some still digital cameras are also capable of capturing sequential images, such as a burst image. Accordingly, what is needed is a method and system for interactively creating a VIDEO from one or more still images...|$|R

50|$|Electronic <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> do {{not have}} {{mechanical}} shutters and allow setting shutter speed directly in time units. Professional <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> often allow selecting shutter speed in terms of shutter angle instead of time units, especially those {{that are capable of}} overcranking or undercranking.|$|R

In November 1995, the duo pledged to dissolve the K Foundation and to refrain from public discussion of the burning {{for a period of}} 23 years, but Drummond spoke about the burning in 2000 and 2004. Initially, he was unrepentant, but in 2004 he admitted to the BBC that he regretted burning the money.|$|E

5|$|A {{research}} team undertook {{a study in}} 2016 to understand the appeal behind Mercury's voice. Led by Professor Christian Herbst, the team identified his notably faster vibrato and use of subharmonics as unique characteristics of Mercury's voice, particularly in comparison to opera singers, and confirmed a vocal range from F#2 to G5 (just over 3 octaves) but were unable to confirm claims of a 4-octave range. The {{research team}} studied vocal samples from 23 commercially available Queen recordings, his solo work, {{and a series of}} interviews of the late artist. They also used an endoscopic <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> to study a rock singer brought in to imitate Mercury's singing voice.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert started {{developing}} {{what came to}} be known as the Society of Mind theory which views biological brain as massively parallel computer. In 1986, Minsky published The Society of Mind, which claims that “mind is formed from many little agents, each mindless by itself”. The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts. Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a <b>video</b> <b>camera,</b> and a computer to build with children's blocks.|$|E

Ferris is surrounded by a group of SUVs, which circle him to create an obscuring dust cloud before picking him up. The dust cloud blocks Hoffman's view, so that he cannot determine which of the SUVs, now headed in different directions, is carrying Ferris. Ferris is taken across the border to Syria where he is to be interrogated by Al-Saleem. When Ferris asks Al-Saleem about Aisha, he is told that someone has lied to him and that he has been double-crossed. Ferris tells Al-Saleem that there is an infiltrator (Karami) in his organization who works for Ferris, and that, by association, Al-Saleem works for Ferris. Al-Saleem does not believe Ferris, beats him, turns on a <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> and orders his execution. Salaam and his agents arrive at the last moment, saving Ferris' life.

The first images shown on the screens feature Aguilera as Catwoman, a futuristic blue haired character, and a 1960s influenced hippie before focusing on the 60's inspired character. The blond character is shown to be holding an old fashioned handheld <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> filming scenes of high rise buildings, all the while showing shots of Aguilera editing the on screen projection. The blond hippie inspired character is then seen in a second setting, riding a bicycle through a grassy field at times performing dance movements to the song and lip-synching.|$|E
5|$|Though {{breeding}} can {{be improved}} by supplementary feeding, the survival of young kakapo is hampered {{by the presence of}} Polynesian rats. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats. Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using traps and poison stations as soon as a nest had been detected. A small <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> and infra-red light source watch the nest continuously, and will scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds. To increase the success rate of nesting, a nest watcher places a small thermostatically controlled electric blanket over the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29% in unprotected nests to 75% in protected ones.|$|E
