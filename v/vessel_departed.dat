After {{participating}} in missions in which eight aviators were rescued, the <b>vessel</b> <b>departed</b> Subic Bay {{and arrived at}} San Diego on 18 December. The ship stood out of San Diego on 15 October 1966, bound a second time for Southeast Asian waters, returning to its homeport on 28 March 1967 and making a midshipman training cruise to Pearl Harbor. Richmond K. Turner departed for its third tour off Vietnam on 10 June 1968, and contributed to Fleet readiness in Asian waters until returning to San Diego in December 1968.|$|E
25|$|On June 27, 1839, La Amistad ("Friendship"), a Spanish <b>vessel,</b> <b>departed</b> {{from the}} port of Havana, Cuba (then a Spanish colony), for the Province of Puerto Principe, also in Cuba. The masters of La Amistad were the ship's captain Ramón Ferrer, José Ruiz, and Pedro Montez, all Spanish nationals. With Ferrer was his {{personal}} slave, Antonio. Ruiz was transporting 49 Africans, entrusted {{to him by the}} governor-general of Cuba. Montez held four additional Africans, also entrusted to him by the governor-general. As the voyage normally took only four days, the crew had brought four days’ worth of rations, not anticipating the strong headwind that slowed the schooner. On July 2, 1839, one of the Africans, Cinqué, freed himself and the other captives using a file that had been found and kept by a woman who, like them, had been on the Tecora (the ship that had transported them illegally as slaves from Africa to Cuba).|$|E

500|$|The Halloween Storm of 1991 left {{significant}} damage {{along the east}} coast of the United States, primarily in Massachusetts and southern New Jersey. Across seven states, damage totaled over $200 million (1991 USD). Over a three-day period, the storm lashed the northeastern United States with high waves, causing damage to beachfront properties from North Carolina to Maine. The coastal flooding damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses and closed roads and airports. In addition, high winds left about 38,000 people without power. The total without power was much less than for Hurricane Bob two months prior, and was fairly low due to little rainfall and the general lack of leaves on trees. Overall there were thirteen confirmed deaths, including six on board Andrea Gail, a swordfishing boat. The <b>vessel</b> <b>departed</b> Gloucester, Massachusetts, for the waters off Nova Scotia. After encountering high seas {{in the middle of the}} storm, the vessel made its last radio contact late on October 28 about [...] northeast of Sable Island. Andrea Gail sank while returning to Gloucester, her debris washing ashore over the subsequent weeks. The crew of six was presumed killed after a Coast Guard search was unable to find them. The storm and the boat's sinking became the center-piece for Sebastian Junger's best-selling non-fiction book The Perfect Storm (1997), which was adapted to a major Hollywood film in 2000 as The Perfect Storm starring George Clooney.|$|E

2500|$|The S.S. Bombo was {{commissioned}} {{in the late}} 1920's by State Metal Quarries of NSW to replace its ageing vessel the S.S. Kiama. Constructed on the River Forth at Leith, Scotland by the shipbuilder Henry Robb Ltd, the new vessel was completed in late 1929 and passed its sea trials in early 1930. The <b>vessel</b> <b>departed</b> Scotland on 11 February 1933 on the long voyage to Australia {{under the command of}} Captain William Manning, arriving in Sydney on 23 April. It was immediately placed into service under Captain Arthur Robert Bell, and assigned the task of freighting bulk blue metal (basalt aggregate) from Kiama on the NSW South Coast to Sydney, a round-trip distance of around [...] which the Bombo could complete in 22 hours. For the next six years the vessel typically completed five return trips per week from Kiama without significant mishap.|$|E
2500|$|Fridtjof Nansen's 1893–1896 {{expedition}} {{aboard the}} Fram attempted {{to reach the}} geographical North Pole by harnessing the natural east–west current of the Arctic Ocean. His custom-built <b>vessel</b> <b>departed</b> Christiania (today Oslo) on 24June 1893 and sailed to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean. There she became frozen into the pack ice and {{had to wait for}} the drift to carry her towards the pole. Impatient with the slow progress and erratic character of the drift, after eighteen months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges to make for the pole. On 14March, with the ship at 84°4′N, the pair finally began their polar march. They did not reach their objective, but achieved a record [...] "Farthest North" [...] latitude of 86°13.6′N before their long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
