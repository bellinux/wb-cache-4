Coghlan and his wife lodged at the Grand Hotel. In 1901, not long after they arrived, the Coghlans' first child was born, but the baby lived only three days. A second child, a girl named Petal, was born in November 1902 and lived to old age.|$|E

Some of the <b>very</b> <b>basics</b> are {{the context in which}} the Earth and humankind exist in space and time, the Earth’s climate, the Earth’s population and humankind’s options and choices. The author advocates keeping an open mind on all available options, including the use of oil, gas, coal, tar sands, carbon capture and sequestration, nuclear power etc., as well as the technologies that are more widely considered ‘green’. The author also argues that, in addressing the challenges that humankind faces, globally concerted effort is required...|$|R

5|$|Opened {{as part of}} {{an attempt}} to {{encourage}} holiday traffic on the line, the halt primarily served golfers at the nearby Royal Cromer Golf Club. The station facilities were <b>very</b> <b>basic,</b> consisting of no more than a single wooden platform, which cost £170 to build, two wooden benches and running in board together with the obligatory oil lamps. No shelter was provided for passengers and the platform was constructed of sleepers and supported by wooden trestles.|$|E

The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes. Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.|$|E

Given {{how hard it was}} to find decent housing, they decided instead to share with Helge Rubinstein and her husband, the literary agent Hilary Rubinstein, who at the time was working for his uncle, Victor Gollancz. In 1955 the four of them bought a four-storey, seven-bedroom house in Phillimore Place, Kensington, for ₤6,800, a home they lived in together for 14 years. Williams described it as one of the happiest periods of his life.|$|E
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a <b>very</b> <b>basic,</b> elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September Bostock {{gained the}} {{agreement}} of Kenney's headquarters to deploy No.80 Wing to the recently captured island of Morotai in the NEI {{as part of a}} redeployment of RAAF units in the SWPA. While this raised morale within No.80 Wing, it had only a short time to prepare to move overseas. On 8November Caldwell received orders to begin the movement to Morotai as soon as possible, and he visited the island late that month. During this visit he observed that it was likely that supply shortages would impede the wing's operations. No.80 Wing's headquarters left Darwin on 9December and No.452 Squadron departed on 15December. During the squadron's trip to Morotai three Spitfires were destroyed or damaged as a result of landing accidents at Merauke, New Guinea on 15December. As expected, living facilities at Morotai were initially <b>very</b> <b>basic,</b> and Caldwell traded liquor for the services of US engineer units to improve the wing's camp site.|$|E

5|$|Malmö FF's {{board of}} {{directors}} initiated {{the search for a}} new stadium in the mid-1990s. Malmö Stadion, where Malmö FF had played since its construction in 1958, was starting to deteriorate by this time, and was also too large for the club, which often struggled to fill it for Allsvenskan matches. In 1995, club chairman Bengt Madsen began {{to raise money for the}} renovation of Malmö IP, the club's former home between 1910 and 1957, into a modern football stadium. Malmö IP was practical and economical for the club as it was already an extant site, and was smaller than Malmö Stadion, which was expensive to maintain. The renovation of Malmö IP was finished in August 1999, and Malmö FF moved in soon after. However, the renovated ground failed to live up to expectations, proving to be <b>very</b> <b>basic</b> by modern standards; the paltry capacity of 7,600 was also deemed a security issue. The club therefore moved back to Malmö Stadion in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} {{was first}} governed by William Henry Harrison {{who oversaw the}} negotiation with the native inhabitants to open {{large parts of the}} territory to settlement. In 1810 a popularly elected government was established as the territory continued to grow in population and develop a <b>very</b> <b>basic</b> road network, government, and education system. At the outbreak of Tecumseh's War, the territory was on the front line of battle and Harrison led a military force in the opening hostilities at the Battle of Tippecanoe, and then in the subsequent invasion of Canada during the War of 1812. Thomas Posey was appointed to the vacant governorship, but the opposition party, led by Congressman Jonathan Jennings, had dominance in the territorial affairs for its remaining years and began pressing for statehood. In June 1816, a constitutional convention was held and a state government was formed. The territory was dissolved on December 11, 1816, by an act of Congress granting statehood to Indiana.|$|E
5|$|With Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers {{becoming}} the ninth and tenth {{members of the}} league, the 2005–06 season began with nine clubs (Manchester had opted to take another season out with no rink yet constructed). However, in November 2005 London Racers withdrew their team from competition and immediately ceased operations. From their formation the Racers had suffered problems finding a rink with comparable facilities to those of their rivals and they had maintained {{only a very small}} fan base. The club had made the Lee Valley Ice Centre their home after playing {{only a small number of}} games at the Alexandra Palace in their first season. The facilities were <b>very</b> <b>basic,</b> seating only 900 people with an overall capacity of barely 1000. In November 2005, during a game against Nottingham Panthers; Panthers player Blaž Emeršič suffered a serious facial injury after colliding with a protruding object in the boardings. Further concerns were raised when a game against the Sheffield Steelers was abandoned after a piece of plexiglas shattered in an irregular manner, injuring a spectator. When a similar event took place during practice a few days later; the Racers management began to question seriously the safety of the rink. With the Ice Centre unable to ensure the safety of players and spectators at Elite League games, the Racers were forced to suspend team operations with immediate effect.|$|E
