40|$|We {{report the}} results of a part-task {{simulation}} evaluating the separate and combined effects of an electronic moving map display and newly developed HUD symbology on ground taxi performance, under moderate- and low-visibility conditions. Twenty-four commercial airline pilots carried out a series of 28 gate-to-runway taxi trials at Chicago O'Hare. Half of the trials were conducted under moderate <b>visibility</b> (<b>RVR</b> 1400 ft), and half under low <b>visibility</b> (<b>RVR</b> 700 ft). In the baseline condition, where navigation support was limited to surface features and a Jeppesen paper map, navigation errors were committed on almost half of the trials. These errors were virtually abolished when the electronic moving map or the HUD symbology was available; in addition, compared to the baseline condition, both forms of navigation aid yielded an increase in forward taxi speed. The speed increase was greater for the HUD than the electronic moving map, and greater under low visibility than under moderate visibility. These results suggest that the combination of electronic moving map and HUD symbology has the potential to greatly increase the efficiency of ground taxi operations, particularly under low-visibility conditions...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{investigates the}} capability of Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS) to provide significant situation awareness in terminal area operations, specifically in low visibility conditions. The use of a Head-Up Display (HUD) and Head-Down Displays (HDD) with SVS is contrasted to baseline standard head down displays in terms of induced workload and pilot behavior in 1400 <b>RVR</b> <b>visibility</b> levels. Variances across performance and pilot behavior were reviewed for acceptability when using HUD or HDD with SVS under reduced minimums to acquire the necessary visual components to continue to land. The data suggest superior performance for HUD implementations. Improved attentional behavior is also suggested for HDD implementations of SVS for low-visibility approach and landing operations...|$|R
40|$|A {{rectangle}} <b>visibility</b> representation (<b>RVR)</b> of a graph {{consists of}} an assignment of axis-aligned rectangles to vertices such that for every edge there exists a horizontal or vertical line of sight between the rectangles assigned to its endpoints. Testing whether a graph has an RVR {{is known to be}} NP-hard. In this paper, we study the problem of finding an RVR under the assumption that an embedding in the plane of the input graph is fixed and we are looking for an RVR that reflects this embedding. We show that in this case the problem can be solved in polynomial time for general embedded graphs and in linear time for 1 -plane graphs (i. e., embedded graphs having at most one crossing per edge). The linear time algorithm uses a precise list of forbidden configurations, which extends the set known for straight-line drawings of 1 -plane graphs. These forbidden configurations can be tested for in linear time, and so in linear time we can test whether a 1 -plane graph has an RVR and either compute such a representation or report a negative witness. Finally, we discuss some extensions of our study to the case when the embedding is not fixed but the RVR can have at most one crossing per edge...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic Vision Systems and Enhanced Flight Vision System (SVS/EFVS) {{technologies}} {{have the potential}} to provide additional margins of safety for aircrew performance and enable operational improvements for low visibility operations in the terminal area environment with equivalent efficiency as visual operations. To meet this potential, research is needed for effective technology development and implementation of regulatory and design guidance to support introduction and use of SVS/EFVS advanced cockpit vision technologies in Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) operations. A fixed-base pilot-in-the-loop simulation test was conducted at NASA Langley Research Center that evaluated the use of SVS/EFVS in NextGen low visibility ground (taxi) operations and approach/landing operations. Twelve crews flew approach and landing operations in a simulated NextGen Chicago O Hare environment. Various scenarios tested the potential for EFVS for operations in visibility as low as 1000 ft runway <b>visibility</b> range (<b>RVR)</b> and SVS to enable lower decision heights (DH) than can currently be flown today. Expanding the EFVS visual segment from DH to the runway in visibilities as low as 1000 RVR appears to be viable as touchdown performance was excellent without any workload penalties noted for the EFVS concept tested. A lower DH to 150 ft and/or possibly reduced visibility minima by virtue of SVS equipage appears to be viable when implemented on a Head-Up Display, but the landing data suggests further study for head-down implementations...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1975 / Sheraton Inn, Silver Spring, MarylandThe {{performance}} of a laser gate ship mast detector is evaluated. The laser gate consists of transmitting optics and laser {{on one side of}} a shipping channel and receiving optics and detector {{on the other side of}} the channel. Expressions relating the probability of detection and the false alarm rate to laser power, noise, visibility or atmospheric attenuation of the beam are developed. Finally, at power levels meeting safety standards and for useful probabilities of detection and false alarm rates, the visibilities which limit system performance are determined as a function of laser gate path length. The gate, at visible wave lengths, will function at visibilities only slightly less than the path length. In the next step, the expected {{performance of}} the laser gate using a CO₂ laser radiating at 10. 6 μ in the infrared is analyzed. The extinction coefficient, which is only a fraction of that in the visible case, is estimated for poor <b>visibility</b> conditions (<b>RVR</b> = 1, 000 ft.) from a combination of attenuation measurements relating attenuation to total water content and meterological results relating visibility to total water content. Then, for the infrared system, the same arguments as above are invoked and, in this case, it is shown that the infrared system will provide the required performance at much longer path lengths...|$|R

In CAT IIIB Airports the pilots have to land with as low a visibility as 50 meters during dense fog. Drishti system with 30 meters baseline is {{first of its kind}} installed at any airport in the country. In this paper we report visibility measurements of Drishti during different weather conditions viz., dust storm, rainfall and dense fog at IGI Airport, New Delhi. Drishti data has been compared with other imported transmissometers which have been situated in the Airport either parallel to Drishti or installed few kms away. It has been observed that Drishti measures visibility very accurately. Remote health monitoring of the system through Web-enabling, fast and easy field maintenance through modular electronics are some of the salient features of the system. IGI Airport is the first airport in the country to have Indigenous systems in all its three runways...|$|R
