40|$|Two {{types of}} non-global bandwidth, {{which may be}} called local and variable, have been defined in {{attempts}} to improve the performance of kernel density estimators. In nonparametric regression, local linear fitting has become a method of much popularity. It is natural, therefore, to consider the use of non-global bandwidths in the local linear context, and indeed local bandwidths are often used. In this paper, {{it is observed that}} a natural proposal in the literature for combining <b>variable,</b> <b>bandwidths</b> with local linear fitting fails {{in the sense that the}} resulting mean squared error properties are those normally associated with local rather than <b>variable</b> <b>bandwidths.</b> We are able to understand why this happens in terms of weightings that are involved. We also attempt to investigate how the bias reduction expected of well-chosen <b>variable</b> <b>bandwidths</b> might be achieved in conjunction with local linear fitting...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a nonparametric method, based on locally <b>variable</b> <b>bandwidths</b> kernel estimators, to {{describe}} the space-time variation of seismic activity of a region of Southern California. The flexible estimation approach is introduced together with a diagnostic method for space-time point process, based on the interpretation of some second-order statistics, to analyze the dependence structure of observed data and suggest directions for fit improvement. In this paper we review a diagnostic method for space-time point processes based on the interpretation of the transformed version of some second-order statistics. The method is useful to analyze dependence structures of observed data and suggests directions for fit improvement also when a more flexible estimator of the conditional intensity function is used, such as the kernel one. In particular locally <b>variable</b> <b>bandwidths</b> kernel estimators are used to describe space-time variations of seismic activity of a region of Southern California...|$|R

The selection is steered toward a power efficient criterion which may exhibit variable SE levels.|$|R
50|$|If the {{bandwidth}} is {{not held}} fixed, but is varied {{depending upon the}} location of either the estimate (balloon estimator) or the samples (pointwise estimator), this produces a particularly powerful method termed adaptive or <b>variable</b> <b>bandwidth</b> kernel density estimation.|$|E
50|$|The {{modified}} Allan variance (MVAR), {{also known}} as mod &sigma;y2(&tau;), is a <b>variable</b> <b>bandwidth</b> modified variant of Allan variance, a measurement of frequency stability in clocks, oscillators and amplifiers. Its main advantage relative to Allan variance {{is its ability to}} separate white phase noise from flicker phase noise.|$|E
50|$|Code {{division}} multiplexing (CDM), Code division {{multiple access}} (CDMA) or spread spectrum is a class of techniques where several channels simultaneously share the same frequency spectrum, and this spectral bandwidth {{is much higher than}} the bit rate or symbol rate. One form is frequency hopping, another is direct sequence spread spectrum. In the latter case, each channel transmits its bits as a coded channel-specific sequence of pulses called chips. Number of chips per bit, or chips per symbol, is the spreading factor. This coded transmission typically is accomplished by transmitting a unique time-dependent series of short pulses, which are placed within chip times within the larger bit time. All channels, each with a different code, can be transmitted on the same fiber or radio channel or other medium, and asynchronously demultiplexed. Advantages over conventional techniques are that <b>variable</b> <b>bandwidth</b> is possible (just as in statistical multiplexing), that the wide bandwidth allows poor signal-to-noise ratio according to Shannon-Hartley theorem, and that multi-path propagation in wireless communication can be combated by rake receivers.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the idea that}} the variances or correlations in financial returns may all change conditionally and slowly over time. A multi-step local dynamic conditional correlation model is proposed for simultaneously modelling these components. In particular, the local and conditional correlations are jointly estimated by multivariate kernel regression. A multivariate k-NN method with <b>variable</b> <b>bandwidths</b> is developed to solve the curse of dimension problem. Asymptotic properties of the estimators are discussed in detail. Practical performance of the model is illustrated by applications to foreign exchange rates. ...|$|R
40|$|A robust {{version of}} local linear {{regression}} smoothers augmented with <b>variable</b> <b>bandwidths</b> is investigated for dependent spatial processes. The (uniform) weak consistency {{as well as}} asymptotic normality for the local linear M-estimator (LLME) of the spatial regression function g(x) are established under some mild conditions. Furthermore, an additive model is considered to avoid the curse of dimensionality for spatial processes and an estimation procedure based on combining the marginal integration technique with LLME is applied in this paper. Meanwhile, we present a simulated study to illustrate the proposed estimation method. Our simulation {{results show that the}} estimation method works well numerically. Copyright 2009 The Authors.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} uniform asymptotics in kernel functional estimation where the bandwidth can depend on the data. In a unified approach we investigate kernel estimates of the density and the hazard rate for uncensored and right-censored observations. The model allows for the fixed bandwidth {{as well as for}} various <b>variable</b> <b>bandwidths,</b> e. g. the nearest neighbor bandwidth. An elementary proof for the strong consistency of the generalized estimator is given that builds on the local convergence of the empirical process against the cumulative distribution function and the Nelson-Aalen estimator against the cumulative hazard rate, respectively.

5000|$|Nonparametric {{approaches}} to estimate heavy- and superheavy-tailed probability density functions were given in Markovich. These are approaches based on <b>variable</b> <b>bandwidth</b> and long-tailed kernel estimators; on the preliminary data transform {{to a new}} random variable at finite or infinite intervals which is more convenient for the estimation and then inverse transform of the obtained density estimate; and [...] "piecing-together approach" [...] which provides a certain parametric model for {{the tail of the}} density and a non-parametric model to approximate the mode of the density. Nonparametric estimators require an appropriate selection of tuning (smoothing) parameters like a bandwidth of kernel estimators and the bin width of the histogram. The well known data-driven methods of such selection are a cross-validation and its modifications, methods based on the minimization of the mean squared error (MSE) and its asymptotic and their upper bounds. A discrepancy method which uses well-known nonparametric statistics like Kolmogorov-Smirnov's, von Mises and Anderson-Darling's ones as a metric in the space of distribution functions (dfs) and quantiles of the later statistics as a known uncertainty or a discrepancy value can be found in. Bootstrap is another tool to find smoothing parameters using approximations of unknown MSE by different schemes of re-samples selection, see e.g.|$|E
