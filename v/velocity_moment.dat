50|$|The main {{difference}} between VC1 and VC2 {{is that in}} the latter the centroid of the vortex follows the local <b>velocity</b> <b>moment</b> weighted by vorticity.

One drawback is that VC2 is not as robust as VC1 because while VC1 involves convection like inward propagation of vorticity balanced by an outward second order diffusion, VC2 involves a second order inward propagation of vorticity balanced by 4th order outward dissipation. This approach has been further extended to solve wave equation and is called Wave confinement (WC).|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} interest in processing sequences of images motivates development of techniques for sequence-based object analysis and description. Accordingly, new <b>velocity</b> <b>moments</b> {{have been developed}} to allow a statistical description of both shape and associated motion through an image sequence. Through a generic framework motion information is determined using the established centralised moments, enabling statistical moments to be applied to motion based time series analysis. The translation invariant Cartesian <b>velocity</b> <b>moments</b> suffer from highly correlated descriptions due to their non-orthogonality. The new Zernike <b>velocity</b> <b>moments</b> overcome this by using orthogonal spatial descriptions through the proven orthogonal Zernike basis. Further, they are translation and scale invariant. To illustrate their benefits and application the Zernike <b>velocity</b> <b>moments</b> have been applied to gait recognition—an emergent biometric. Good recognition results have been achieved on multiple datasets using relatively few spatial and/or motion features and basic feature selection and classification techniques. The prime aim of this new technique is to allow the generation of statistical features which encode shape and motion information, with generic application capability. Applied performance analyses illustrate the properties of the Zernike <b>velocity</b> <b>moments</b> which exploit temporal correlation to improve a shape's description.

Large magnetic field fluctuations and high earthward ion velocity moments measured by the WIND spacecraft show a nearly one-to-one correspondence with the auroral intensifications. Analysis of the plasma parameters indicates that there is no difference in the behavior of the plasma during pseudobreakups as compared to substorm expansive phase onset. Inspection of the ion distribution functions during high <b>velocity</b> <b>moment</b> events reveals the presence of a two component plasma.

30|$|In {{considering}} the plasma around a neutron star, we encounter a charged {{gas in the}} curved space. In statistical formalism of such problem usually we just need the first <b>velocity</b> <b>moment</b> of Vlasov or Boltzmann equation. In the equation of first <b>velocity</b> <b>moment</b> we study the average motion of particles in all elements. It is clear that every particle’s trajectory is not in full adjustment to the element’s trajectory. Some physical phenomena {{come back to this}} mismatching. For example, the first <b>velocity</b> <b>moment</b> cannot explain the Landau damping. Apart from this, the very charged particle motion is an important problem that contains some mathematical complexity. Radiation field of a charged particle motion in curved space, in general, can be divided into two parts: electromagnetic field and gravitational field. In this paper we only consider the first one. The solution of Maxwell’s equation depends on several parameters, e.g., on the presence of other charged particles and the spacetime geometry. We focus on a particle that, even small, changes the spacetime geometry. One of the known ways to solve the differential equations is the use of Green functions. The Green functions that is appropriate for our problem are bitensors. Bitensor is a mathematical object that is defined in two distinct points of a manifold. The method we specially focus on it using another mathematical object: difference of two tensors belonging to two distinct tangent spaces. In this manner we come to a new mathematical concept in the formulation of the problem. These new mathematical concepts need further research and studies. We discuss some aspects of these new concepts in this paper. Our paper contains following aspects. First we describe the charge particle motion in the curved spacetime and discuss some of its complexities then in Sect. 3, the electromagnetic self-force is discussed by axiomatic approach. In Sect. 4, the Conservation of energy is considered that is the extension of energy conservation theorem to the curved space. Finally, in Sect. 5 we have discussed the new mathematical concepts that are introduced in the problem.|$|E

In particular, if the second <b>velocity</b> <b>moment</b> tensor is everywhere exactly aligned in spherical polar coordinates, then the potential must be of separable or Stäckel form (excepting degenerate cases where two or more of the semiaxes of ellipsoid are everywhere the same). The theorem also has restrictive consequences for alignment in cylindrical polar coordinates, which is used in the popular Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM) of Cappellari. We analyse data on the radial velocities and proper motions of a sample of ∼ 7300 stars in the stellar halo of the Milky Way. We provide the distributions of the tilt angles or misalignments from both the spherical polar coordinate systems. We show that in this sample the misalignment is always small (usually within 3 °) for Galactocentric radii between ∼ 6 and ∼ 11 kpc. The velocity anisotropy is very radially biased (β ≈ 0. 7), and almost invariant across the volume in our study. Finally, we construct a triaxial stellar halo in a triaxial NFW dark matter halo using a made-to-measure method.

Separate consideration is given to transport associated with the three main frequency-dependent cross-shore transport processes: that associated with the short (incident) waves, that due to the long (infragravity) waves, and transport associated with the mean flow. Direct comparison between the depth-averaged model predictions, and the in-situ point measurements was facilitated by making the first order assumption that the time-averaged suspension profile is exponential and the wave velocity profile is vertically uniform. An appropriate rippled bed roughness was used to provide the drag coefficient in the energetics model and the vertical length scale of the exponential suspension profile.
