25|$|Somalia proved {{particularly}} challenging {{because much}} of its population of 3.5 million was nomadic. A mass <b>vaccination</b> <b>campaign</b> {{in the country in}} 1969 had failed because many nomadic people in the region had cultural objections to vaccination, and either refused or avoided it. Elimination efforts relied on an intensive reporting system. A severe drought in 1975 exacerbated the difficulties by increasing movement across the border with Ethiopia, and frequent outbreaks continued. In March 1977, surveillance efforts found over 3000 cases in the south of the country. The Somali government {{declared a state of emergency}} and successfully appealed to the United Nations for assistance. By June, when the outbreak peaked, 3000 Somali health workers supervised by 23 international advisers were involved in the eradication efforts. Eradication work was hampered in July when the Ogaden War broke out, limiting access to the desert.|$|E

25|$|After the September 11 attacks, a myth {{arose in}} Pakistan that the United States was using {{immunization}} campaigns to sterilize the local population. Health officials tried to dispel this story, but their efforts, {{in the opinion}} of Heidi Larson, writing in The Guardian, were marred by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), when it conducted a fake Hepatitis B immunization campaign in Bin Laden's residence in Bilal Town at Abbottabad with the help of Dr. Shakil Afridi. The intention of the campaign was to confirm Osama bin Laden's presence in the city by obtaining DNA samples from children suspected of being his. In a letter written to CIA director Leon Panetta, the InterAction Alliance, a union of about 200 U.S.-based non-government organizations, deplored the actions of the CIA in using a <b>vaccination</b> <b>campaign</b> as a cover.

40|$|Background: The annual {{mortality}} rate of human rabies in rural Africa is 3. 6 deaths per 100 000 persons. Rabies {{can be prevented}} with prompt postexposure prophylaxis, but this is costly and often inaccessible in rural Africa.

40|$|AbstractThe Global Polio Eradication Initiative {{is closer}} {{than ever to}} {{achieving}} a polio-free world. Immunization activities must still be carried out in non-endemic countries to maintain population immunity at levels which will stop poliovirus from spreading if it is re-introduced from still-infected areas. In areas {{where there is no}} active transmission of poliovirus, programs must rely on surrogate indicators of population immunity to determine the appropriate immunization activities, typically caregiver-reported vaccination history obtained from non-polio acute flaccid paralysis patients identified through polio surveillance. We used regression models {{to examine the relationship between}} polio <b>vaccination</b> <b>campaigns</b> and caregiver-reported polio vaccination history. We find that in many countries, <b>vaccination</b> <b>campaigns</b> have a surprisingly weak impact on these commonly used indicators. We conclude that alternative criteria and data, such as routine immunization indicators from vaccination records or household surveys, should be considered for planning polio <b>vaccination</b> <b>campaigns,</b> and that validation of such surrogate indicators is necessary if they are to be used as the basis for program planning and risk assessment. We recommend that the GPEI and similar organizations consider or continue devoting additional resources to rigorously study population immunity and campaign effectiveness in at-risk countries...|$|R
40|$|Yellow fever is a {{vector-borne disease}} {{affecting}} humans and non-human primates in tropical areas of Africa and South America. While eradication is not feasible {{due to the}} wildlife reservoir, large scale vaccination activities in Africa during the 1940 s to 1960 s reduced yellow fever incidence for several decades. However, {{after a period of}} low vaccination coverage, yellow fever has resurged in the continent. Since 2006 there has been substantial funding for large preventive mass <b>vaccination</b> <b>campaigns</b> in the most affected countries in Africa to curb the rising burden of disease and control future outbreaks. Contemporary estimates of the yellow fever disease burden are lacking, and the present study aimed to update the previous estimates on the basis of more recent yellow fever occurrence data and improved estimation methods. Generalised linear regression models were fitted to a dataset of the locations of yellow fever outbreaks within the last 25 years to estimate the probability of outbreak reports across the endemic zone. Environmental variables and indicators for the surveillance quality in the affected countries were used as covariates. By comparing probabilities of outbreak reports estimated in the regression with the force of infection estimated for a limited set of locations for which serological surveys were available, the detection probability per case and the force of infection were estimated across the endemic zone. The yellow fever burden in Africa was estimated for the year 2013 as 130, 000 (95 % CI 51, 000 - 380, 000) cases with fever and jaundice or haemorrhage including 78, 000 (95 % CI 19, 000 - 180, 000) deaths, taking into account the current level of vaccination coverage. The impact of the recent mass <b>vaccination</b> <b>campaigns</b> was assessed by evaluating the difference between the estimates obtained for the current vaccination coverage and for a hypothetical scenario excluding these <b>vaccination</b> <b>campaigns.</b> <b>Vaccination</b> <b>campaigns</b> were estimated to have reduced the number of cases and deaths by 27 % (95 % CI 22 %- 31 %) across the region, achieving up to an 82 % reduction in countries targeted by these campaigns. A limitation of our study is the high level of uncertainty in our estimates arising from the sparseness of data available from both surveillance and serological surveys. With the estimation method presented here, spatial estimates of transmission intensity can be combined with vaccination coverage levels to evaluate the impact of past or proposed <b>vaccination</b> <b>campaigns,</b> thereby helping to allocate resources efficiently for yellow fever control. This method has been used by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI Alliance) to estimate the potential impact of future <b>vaccination</b> <b>campaigns...</b>|$|R
500|$|First {{appearing}} in East Africa in 1891, rinderpest, {{a disease of}} cattle, spread rapidly across Africa. By 1892, 95 per cent of the cattle in East Africa had died. This resulted in a famine that devastated the farmers and nomadic people, {{some of whom were}} entirely dependent on their cattle. Two thirds of the population of Maasai people died. The situation was made worse by epidemics of smallpox that followed {{in the wake of the}} famine. In the early years of the 20th century rinderpest was common in Asia and parts of Europe. The prevalence of the disease was steadily reduced during the century by control measures that included vaccination. By 1908 Europe was free from the disease. Outbreaks did occur following the Second World War, but these were quickly controlled. The prevalence of the disease increased in Asia, and in 1957 Thailand had to appeal for aid because so many buffaloes had died that the paddy fields could not be prepared for rice growing. Russia west of the Ural Mountains remained free from the disease– Lenin approved several laws on the control of the disease– but cattle in eastern Russia were constantly infected with rinderpest that originated in Mongolia and China where the prevalence remained high. India controlled the spread of the disease, which had retained a foothold in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, throughout the 20th century, and had eradicated the disease by 1995. Africa suffered two major panzootics in the 1920s and 1980s. There was a severe outbreak in Somalia in 1928 and the disease was widespread in the country until 1953. In the 1980s, outbreaks in Tanzania and Kenya were controlled by the use of 26million doses of vaccine, and a recurrence of the disease in 1997 was suppressed by an intensive <b>vaccination</b> <b>campaign.</b> By the end of the century rinderpest had been eradicated from most countries. A few pockets of infection remained in Ethiopia and Sudan, and in 1994 the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme was launched by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) with the aim of global eradication by 2010. In May 2011, the FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health announced that [...] "rinderpest as a freely circulating viral disease has been eliminated from the world." ...|$|E

2500|$|The global {{effort to}} {{eradicate}} smallpox from endemic {{areas such as}} Africa began in 1959 with a mass <b>vaccination</b> <b>campaign.</b> This approach met with little success, and a more effective targeted approach {{was developed in the}} late 1960s.

The majority of African countries were free from smallpox by 1972. By the end of 1975, the virus had been eradicated worldwide except in Ethiopia and Somalia in the Horn of Africa, and their neighbour Kenya. [...] The nomadic people of the Ogaden Desert retained endemic smallpox with an unusually mild form of the disease, which facilitated persistence in the population.
