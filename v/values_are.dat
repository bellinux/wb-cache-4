5|$|Floating point {{numbers are}} also {{stored in a}} platform-specific range. They can be {{specified}} using floating point notation, or two forms of scientific notation. PHP has a native Boolean type {{that is similar to}} the native Boolean types in Java and C++. Using the Boolean type conversion rules, non-zero <b>values</b> <b>are</b> interpreted as true and zero as false, as in Perl and C++.|$|E
30|$|In the Swedish {{analysis}} set, for the “mild” health state, {{the mean}} VAS <b>value</b> <b>was</b> 71.1 {{and the mean}} TTO <b>value</b> <b>was</b> 0.76. For the “moderate” health state the mean VAS <b>value</b> <b>was</b> 53.9 and the mean TTO <b>value</b> <b>was</b> 0.71 and for the “severe” health state, the mean VAS <b>value</b> <b>was</b> 43.0 and the mean TTO <b>value</b> <b>was</b> 0.58 (Table 3).|$|R
30|$|The {{improvement}} <b>value</b> <b>is</b> 5  % of {{the overall}} objective function value. The cessation <b>value</b> <b>is</b> 20 iterations, while the Max fix <b>value</b> <b>is</b> 5 iterations. The Max minor move value and Max non-improving move <b>value</b> <b>are</b> both 15. The planning ACL Max violation is 2.5  % greater than the planning ACL value, and the initial tabu tenure <b>value</b> <b>is</b> 20.|$|R

5|$|Pliny gives special {{attention}} to spices, such as pepper, ginger, and cane sugar. He mentions different varieties of pepper, whose <b>values</b> <b>are</b> comparable with that of gold and silver, while sugar is noted only for its medicinal value.|$|E

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2012, the EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) taxa {{richness}} was 10 and the Becks Index <b>value</b> <b>was</b> 9. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index <b>value</b> <b>was</b> 3.582 and the Shannon Wiener Index <b>value</b> <b>was</b> 2.104.|$|R
50|$|This {{declares}} the enum colors type; the int constants RED (whose <b>value</b> <b>is</b> 0), GREEN (whose <b>value</b> <b>is</b> one {{greater than}} RED, 1), BLUE (whose <b>value</b> <b>is</b> the given <b>value,</b> 5), and YELLOW (whose <b>value</b> <b>is</b> one greater than BLUE, 6); and the enum colors variable paint_color. The constants {{may be used}} outside of {{the context of the}} enum (where any integer <b>value</b> <b>is</b> allowed), and <b>values</b> other than the constants may be assigned to paint_color, or any other variable of type enum colors.|$|R
5|$|Psilocybin is an {{alkaloid}} that is soluble in water, methanol and aqueous ethanol, but insoluble {{in organic}} solvents like chloroform and petroleum ether. Its pKa <b>values</b> <b>are</b> {{estimated to be}} 1.3 and 6.5 for the two successive phosphate OH groups and 10.4 for the dimethylamine nitrogen, so in general it exists as a zwitterionic structure.|$|E
5|$|Some {{modifications}} to the WHO definitions {{have been made by}} particular organizations. The surgical literature breaks down class II and III obesity into further categories whose exact <b>values</b> <b>are</b> still disputed.|$|E
5|$|Some proofs that 0.999... = 1 {{rely on the}} Archimedean {{property}} of the real numbers: {{that there are no}} nonzero infinitesimals. Specifically, the difference 1 − 0.999... must be smaller than any positive rational number, so it must be an infinitesimal; but since the reals do not contain nonzero infinitesimals, the difference is therefore zero, and therefore the two <b>values</b> <b>are</b> the same.|$|E

5|$|The nor'easter {{occurred}} during a positive {{phase of the}} North Atlantic oscillation (NAO), though negative NAO <b>values</b> <b>are</b> typically considered optimal for snowstorms in the northeastern United States.

5|$|There are {{multiple}} techniques {{to determine the}} pKa of a chemical, leading to some discrepancies between different sources. Well measured <b>values</b> <b>are</b> typically within 0.1 units of each other. Data presented here were taken at 25°C in water. More values {{can be found in}} thermodynamics, above.|$|E

For telescopes in solar orbit, the minimum distance (periapsis) and the maximum distance (apoapsis) between the telescope and the center of mass of the sun are given in astronomical units (AU).|$|E
5|$|Described by Kartodikromo as an {{extended}} simile, Student Hidjo {{has been noted}} as depicting a new Indonesian youth culture which has adopted Western cultural and lingual facets. Traditional Javanese and Dutch cultural <b>values</b> <b>are</b> contrasted; from this contrast, Kartodikromo advocates a view that the two are incompatible. This includes love, which is described in the novel as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find; the traditional view being that marriage {{is to be used}} for social mobility.|$|E
5|$|In his text, An Unusual Feast: Gumbo and the Complex Brew of Black Religion, author Derek Hicks {{suggest that}} “through gumbo, traditions and <b>values</b> <b>are</b> transmitted.” This quote {{represents}} his larger claim that gumbo does this for African American culture, uniting {{a group of}} people by one very powerful dish. According to Hicks, it is not just that gumbo is a cultural and historical food in the black community, but that it continues to foster that community through its flavors, colors and eating methods, which are usually in large groups where it can be shared among many people.|$|E

5|$|Monetary <b>values</b> <b>are</b> {{inflated}} {{to contemporary}} values using {{changes in the}} British Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This measures the social cost of construction or investment {{as a proportion of}} the economy's total output of goods and services, showing the equivalent social impact in current terms: how much contemporary Britons would need to forgo in order to invest a similar amount of the current British economy. As of January 2017, the latest year for which contemporary figures are available is 2015.|$|E
5|$|Outside of the {{seasonal}} variations, the geothermal gradient of temperatures through the crust is 25–30°C (77–86°F) per kilometer of depth {{in most of}} the world. The conductive heat flux averages 0.1MW/km2. These <b>values</b> <b>are</b> much higher near tectonic plate boundaries where the crust is thinner. They may be further augmented by fluid circulation, either through magma conduits, hot springs, hydrothermal circulation or a combination of these.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. Risk factors for toxicity include alcoholism, malnutrition, and the taking of certain other medications. Liver damage results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI decreases the liver's glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver. Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken. These <b>values</b> <b>are</b> often plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine level of concern.|$|E
50|$|Pascal {{routines}} that {{return a}} <b>value</b> <b>are</b> called functions; routines that don't return a <b>value</b> <b>are</b> called procedures. All routines in C are called functions; C functions {{that do not}} return a <b>value</b> <b>are</b> declared with a return type of void.|$|R
