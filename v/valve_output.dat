5000|$|A {{single line}} {{progressive}} system uses lubricant flow to cycle individual metering valves and valve assemblies. The valves consist of dispensing pistons {{moving back and}} forth in a specific bore. Each piston depends on flow from the previous piston to shift and displace lubricant. If one piston doesn’t shift, none of the following pistons will shift. <b>Valve</b> <b>output</b> is not adjustable.|$|E
50|$|Because {{driving the}} power valves this hard also means maximum volume, {{which can be}} {{difficult}} to manage in a small recording or rehearsal space, many solutions have emerged that in some way divert some of this power <b>valve</b> <b>output</b> from the speakers, and allow the player to generate power valve distortion without excessive volume. These include built-in or separate power attenuators and power-supply-based power attenuation, such as a VVR, or Variable Voltage Regulator to drop the voltage on the valves' plates, to increase distortion whilst lowering volume. Guitarists such as Edward Van Halen have been known to use variacs before VVR technology was invented. Lower-power valve amps (such as a quarter-watt or less), speaker isolation cabinets, and low-efficiency guitar speakers are also used to tame the volume.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the water}} level is below both switches, the float switch {{physical}} contacts are both closed, and a true (logic 1) value is passed to the Fill <b>Valve</b> <b>output.</b> Water begins to fill the tank. The internal [...] "Fill Valve" [...] contact latches the circuit so that even when the [...] "Low Level" [...] contact opens (as the water passes the lower switch), the fill valve remains on. Since the High Level is also normally closed, water continues to flow as {{the water level}} remains between the two switch levels. Once the water level rises enough so that the [...] "High Level" [...] switch is off (opened), the PLC will shut the inlet to stop the water from overflowing; {{this is an example}} of seal-in (latching) logic. The output is sealed in until a high level condition breaks the circuit. After that the fill valve remains off until the level drops so low that the Low Level switch is activated, and the process repeats again.|$|E

40|$|An {{equation}} {{that relates}} the pressure flow characteristics of hydraulic spool valves was developed. The dependent variable is <b>valve</b> <b>output</b> pressure, {{and the independent}} variables are spool position and flow. This causal form of equation is preferred in applications that simulate the effects of hydraulic line dynamics.

40|$|Control valves are {{the most}} {{prevalent}} final control element in the chemical process industries. However, the behavior of valves (i. e., {{the manner in which}} the <b>valve</b> <b>output</b> flow rate changes in response to changes in the control signal to the valve) can contribute to a number of negative effects in a control loop, such as set-point tracking issues and sustained closed-loop oscillations. Valve stiction, for example, is a dynamic valve nonlinearity (i. e., the relationship between the <b>valve</b> <b>output</b> flow rate and the control signal to the valve is described by nonlinear differential equations) resulting from friction that is known to be problematic in the process industries. This dissertation describes the impact of valve behavior on process control loops and methods for compensating for the valve behavior through appropriate control designs. It begins by describing how the addition of input rate of change constraints to an optimization-based control design with a general objective function (economic model predictive control (EMPC)) can be performed in a manner that may reduce actuator wear while simultaneously guaranteeing feasibility of the controller and closed-loop stability of a nonlinear process operated under the control design. It then focuses on a specific type of actuator (a valve) and elucidates that coupled, nonlinear interactions between the process and valve model states and any internal states of the controller model create the negative effects that may be observed in control loops containing valves for which the dynamics cannot be neglected (e. g., valves subject to significant stiction). These multivariable interactions illustrate the closed-loop nature of the negative effects observed, and this closed-loop perspective is then used to analyze stiction compensation methods from the literature, to develop a novel stiction compensation scheme for control loops under proportional-integral control, and to demonstrate that incorporating models, both first-principles and empirical, of valve behavior within the model used for making state predictions in a model predictive controller is an effective means for compensating for valve behavior in general. The benefits of adding actuation magnitude and input rate of change constraints within EMPC including a model of stiction dynamics are discussed. Throughout the work, process examples are utilized to illustrate the advanced control-based frameworks for understanding and compensating for valve limitations...|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} of valves (vacuum tubes), most {{loudspeakers}} had a nominal impedance of 16Ω. [...] <b>Valve</b> <b>outputs</b> require an output transformer to match the very high output impedance and voltage of the <b>output</b> <b>valves</b> to this lower impedance. [...] These transformers were commonly tapped to allow matching of the output to a multiple loudspeaker setup. [...] For example, two 16Ω loudspeakers in parallel will give an impedance of 8Ω. [...] Since the advent of solid-state amplifiers whose outputs require no transformer, the once-common multiple-impedance outputs have become rare, and lower impedance loudspeakers more common. [...] The most common nominal impedance for a single loudspeaker is now 8Ω. [...] Most solid-state amplifiers are designed to work with loudspeaker combinations of anything from 4Ω to 8Ω.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} road vehicle with hydrodynamic brakes on road slopes, containing disturbances such as the variable load and {{the angle of the}} slope, is presented. The input is the oil filling and the output is the vehicle velocity. A {{mathematical model}} of the filling sump controlled by the proportional spool valve is developed. Using different geometry of the <b>valve</b> <b>output</b> port, the optional geometry is defined so that the pressure response in the chamber are sufficiently linear and quick. The effects of the nonlinear flow through the valve and the air compressibility in the chamber were carefully considered. Finally, a model connecting the control signal in the control unit of the hydrodynamic brake with the pressure in the sump, i. e. with the oil filling in the working space of the brake, is developed, thus completing the modelling and simulation process. The braking torque depends on the oil filling and the number of revolution of the brake rotor. The mathematical models of both the vehicle and the brake are nonlinear, but the analysis is carried out using linear equations valid in corresponding areas limited with nominal values of the model parameters...|$|E

50|$|In a class B {{push-pull}} amplifier, <b>output</b> <b>valve</b> current {{which must}} be provided by the power supply ranges from nearly zero for zero signal to a maximum at maximum signal. Consequently, for linear response to transient signal changes the power supply must have good regulation.|$|R
50|$|Digital outputs {{are used}} to open and close relays and {{switches}} as well as drive a load upon command. An example would be {{to turn on the}} parking lot lights when a photocell indicates it is dark outside.

50|$|The use of {{differential}} ("push-pull") output stages cancels standing bias current drawn through the output transformer {{by each of}} the <b>output</b> <b>valves</b> individually, greatly reducing the problem of core saturation and thus facilitating the construction of more powerful amplifiers {{at the same time}} as using smaller, wider bandwidth and cheaper transformers.|$|R

50|$|In trailers, {{this remote}} air-supply {{is in the}} form of a tank, which is charged {{whenever}} the emergency brakes are released via the red trailer-supply valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, this tank actually receives its air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs of the tractor; the air from both of these reservoirs is merged via a two-way check valve. The two-way check valve is a pneumatic device that has two inputs and one output; each input is connected to one these reservoirs. Only the air that is at the higher pressure is allowed to pass through to the check <b>valve's</b> <b>output,</b> which then passes through the tractor-protection valve, and then travels onward towards the trailer's air-tank and spring brake valve via the red trailer-supply line (a.k.a., the emergency line); this releases the trailer's emergency brakes (a.k.a. spring brakes). The tractor-protection valve is a device that prevents air from being lost from the tractor's braking system in the event of the air-lines becoming separated or broken. The tractor's air-lines connect to the trailer's air-lines via metal connectors known as gladhands. The merged air from both reservoirs of the tractor prevents air-loss from only one tractor braking circuit from causing the trailer's spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location, such as in the middle of an intersection.|$|R
50|$|Many modern {{commercial}} amplifiers (and some hobbyist constructions) place multiple {{pairs of}} <b>output</b> <b>valves</b> of readily obtainable types in parallel to increase power, operating {{from the same}} voltage required by a single pair. A beneficial side effect is that the output impedance of the valves, and thus the transformer turns ratio needed, is reduced, {{making it easier to}} construct a wide bandwidth transformer.|$|R
50|$|The new three stage i-VTEC {{valvetrain}} has low-rpm, high-rpm and cylinder idle mode. High <b>output</b> <b>valve</b> timing {{help the}} engine to increase its output by 9 percent.

As a result, recovery of energy wasted during braking is improved by 10 percent.|$|R
50|$|These devices {{generally}} {{consisted of}} a 12AU7 medium-mu triode driving a single 6L6GC beam power pentode audio <b>output</b> <b>valve</b> or similar. Its effects are distinctive due to convolution of the non-linearity of the triode interacting {{with those of the}} pentode, with both devices operating in class-A mode. The 6L6GC is similar in performance to the industrial type 5881, and also the European type KT66.|$|R
5000|$|Push-pull {{output stages}} can use triodes for lowest Zout and best linearity, but often use tetrodes or pentodes which give greater gain and power. Many <b>output</b> <b>valves</b> such as KT88, EL34, and EL84 were {{specifically}} designed to be operated in either triode or tetrode mode, and some amplifiers can be switched between these modes.

50|$|Audio {{transformers}} {{are those}} {{specifically designed for}} use in audio circuits to carry audio signal.

Audio transformers that operate with loudspeaker voltages and current are larger than those that operate at microphone or line level, which carry much less power.

50|$|Since the stenosed {{aortic valve}} may limit the heart's output, people with aortic {{stenosis}} {{are at risk}} of syncope and dangerously low blood pressure should they use any of a number of medications for cardiovascular diseases that often coexist with aortic stenosis. Examples include nitroglycerin, nitrates, ACE inhibitors, terazosin (Hytrin), and hydralazine. Note that all of these substances lead to peripheral vasodilation. Under normal circumstances, in the absence of aortic stenosis, the heart is able to increase its output and thereby offset the effect of the dilated blood vessels. In some cases of aortic stenosis, however, due to the obstruction of blood flow out of the heart caused by the stenosed aortic <b>valve,</b> cardiac <b>output</b> cannot be increased. Low blood pressure or syncope may ensue.|$|R
50|$|A common myth {{is that a}} {{short-circuit}} in an <b>output</b> <b>valve</b> {{may result}} in the loudspeaker being connected directly across the power supply and destroyed. In practice, the older Futterman-style amplifiers {{have been known to}} damage speakers, due not to shorts but to oscillation. The Circlotron amplifiers often feature direct-coupled outputs, but proper engineering (with a few well-placed fuses) ensures that damage to a speaker is no more likely than with an output transformer.|$|R
