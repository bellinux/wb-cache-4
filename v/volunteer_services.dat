The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army opened 48shelters {{at the peak of}} need for people driven from their homes, which served nearly 300,000meals. After the extensive damage to Houston hospitals, the U. S. Public Health Service team set up a temporary hospital at the Houston Police Academy. The team of 87medical personnel served over 1,000patients within two weeks of Allison's passage. Similarly, the National Disaster Medical System deployed a temporary hospital to Houston with 88 professionals, aiding nearly 500 people.

But there are many complications of this kind of program and these must be dealt with to make such an initiative work successfully in the middle to long term. Some formerly homeless people, who were finally able to obtain housing and other assets which helped to return to a normal lifestyle, have donated money and <b>volunteer</b> <b>services</b> to the organizations that provided aid to them during their homelessness. Alternatively, some social service entities that help homeless people now employ formerly homeless individuals to assist in the care process.|$|E
2500|$|Pratt was so {{successful}} in his correspondence and methods that many Western chiefs, suffering from cold and hunger on their reservations, begged him to bring more children East.

2500|$|German {{women were}} not {{employed}} in the Army, but large numbers took paid employment in industry and factories, and even larger numbers engaged in <b>volunteer</b> <b>services.</b> [...] Housewives were taught how to cook without milk, eggs or fat; agencies helped widows find work. [...] Banks, insurance companies and government offices {{for the first time}} hired women for clerical positions. [...] Factories hired them for unskilled labor– by December 1917, half the workers in chemicals, metals, and machine tools were women. [...] Laws protecting women in the workplace were relaxed, and factories set up canteens to provide food for their workers, lest their productivity fall off. The food situation in 1918 was better, because the harvest was better, but serious shortages continued, with high prices, and a complete lack of condiments and fresh fruit. Many migrants had flocked into Berlin to work in industry and the government ministries, which made for overcrowded housing. Reduced coal supplies left everyone in the cold. Daily life involved long working hours, poor health, and little or no recreation, as well as increasing anxiety for the safety of loved ones in the Army and in prisoner of war camps. [...] The men who returned from the front were those who had been permanently crippled; wounded soldiers who recovered were sent back to the trenches.|$|E
