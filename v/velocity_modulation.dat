40|$|In {{this paper}} we report a novel {{inertial}} instability {{that occurs in}} electro-osmotically driven channel flows.

Here, we study spatially-periodic wall <b>velocity</b> <b>modulations</b> in a two-dimensional straight channel numerically. At low slip velocities, the bulk flow consists of a set of vortices along each wall that are left-right symmetric, while at sufficiently high slip velocities, this flow loses its stability though a supercritical bifurcation. Surprisingly, the new flow state that bifurcates from a left-right symmetric base flow has a rather strong mean component along the channel, which is similar to pressure-driven velocity profiles. The instability sets in at rather small Reynolds numbers of about 20 - 30, and we discuss its potential applications in microfluidic devices. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

In the high-soft state, however, the emission lines from both neutral and ionized elements have unambiguously resolved double-peaked profiles; this indicates the presence of an irradiatively-heated thin accretion disk. Higher-ionization lines have larger peak-to-peak velocity separations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the role of {{background}} texture on an interception task during self-motion. Twenty-six participants modulated tricycle speed along one arm of a V-shaped track so as to intercept a ball approaching horizontally on the other arm of the V. Either a plain or a textured background (consisting of contrasting vertical stripes) was used. <b>Velocity</b> <b>modulations</b> occurred so as to keep the angle β between the direction of heading and the line head-ball constant (constant bearing angle, or CBA strategy), indicating that this observer-environment relation might regulate the approach phase. In the textured condition, participants initially drove faster than predicted by the CBA model and compensated by slowing down in the second half. This is in line with the texture-induced overestimation of the ball velocity and implies that absolute velocity information is also used. © 1999 by the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} the transfer function of a ducted, laminar, premixed flame.

The fluctuations of heat release due to corrugation of the flame by the acoustic wave is measured using a photo-multiplier tube (PMT) while the flow velocity fluctuation is determined by considering the loud speaker diaphragm motion and assuming conservation of classical acoustic energy within the burner. In keeping with other studies, the results clearly show qualitatively the low-pass filter nature of the flame.

50|$|Two {{differences}} from the klystron {{give it a}} lower cost and higher efficiency. First, the klystron uses <b>velocity</b> <b>modulation</b> to create bunching; its beam current is constant. It requires a drift tube several feet in length to allow the electrons to bunch. In contrast the IOT uses current modulation like an ordinary triode; most of the bunching {{is done by the}} grid, so the tube can be much shorter, making it less expensive to build and mount, and less bulky. Secondly, since the klystron has beam current throughout the RF cycle, it can only operate as an inefficient class-A amplifier, while the grid of the IOT allows more versatile operating modes. The grid can be biased so the beam current can be cut off during part of the cycle, enabling it to operate in the more efficient class B or AB mode.|$|E

40|$|It is {{currently}} known that Tollmien–Schlichting (TS) waves can be attenuated by {{the introduction of}} spanwise mean velocity gradients in an otherwise two-dimensional boundary layer (BL). The stabilizing effect, associated with an extra turbulence production term, is strong enough to obtain a delay in transition to turbulence induced by TS waves, with the implication of reducing skin-friction drag. Miniature vortex generators (MVGs), mounted in an array, have successfully been used to obtain <b>velocity</b> <b>modulations</b> by the generation of alternating high- and low-speed streaks in the spanwise direction to control the BL. Experimentally, an initial amplification of the TS waves has been reported, which takes place in the near-wake region of the MVG array. The higher the streak amplitude, the stronger the downstream stabilizing effect becomes, but with the drawback of experiencing an even stronger initial amplification. This can lead to a sub-critical transitional Reynolds number, which would not only mean that the control has failed but, even worse, also lead to an advancement of the transition location. Here, direct numerical simulations and a local spatial stability analysis have been performed in order to reach a deeper understanding of this behaviour. The results agree well with experiments and we propose an explanation of the described behavior in terms of stability properties of the controlled BL. This important knowledge can be used in future designs of BL modulators, which can lead to improved stability of the control and to an extended region of laminar flow...|$|R

50|$|The {{invention}} of the TWT is often attributed to Rudolf Kompfner in 1942-1943. In addition, Nils Lindenblad, working at RCA (Radio Corporation of America) in the USA also filed a patent for a device in May 1940 that was remarkably similar to Kompfner's TWT. Both of these devices were improvements over Haeff's original design as they both used the then newly invented precision electron gun {{as the source of}} the electron beam and they both directed the beam {{down the center of the}} helix instead of outside of it. These configuration changes resulted in much greater wave amplification than Haeff's design as they relied on the physical principles of <b>velocity</b> <b>modulation</b> and electron bunching. Kompfner developed his TWT in a British Admiralty radar laboratory during World War II. His first sketch of his TWT is dated November 12, 1942, and he built his first TWT in early 1943.The TWT was later refined by Kompfner, John R. Pierce, and Lester M. Field at Bell Labs. Note that Kompfner's US patent, granted in 1953, does cite Haeff's previous work.|$|E
50|$|An {{electron}} beam which enters an RF excited cavity with approximately synchronous velocity will receive cumulative <b>velocity</b> <b>modulation</b> at each gap. After some distance into the resonator, repeatedly accelerated electrons will be {{catching up with}} electrons repeatedly decelerated, and bunches will form. These bunches will have a velocity close to the beam velocity. If the electron velocity is somewhat greater than synchronous, the bunches will start to cross gaps when the field is retarding, rather than zero. When this happens, the electrons are slowed; their lost energy is gained by the cavity and sustained oscillations become possible. As the velocity of the beam entering the cavity is increased further, more energy is transferred to the cavity {{and the frequency of}} oscillation rises somewhat. Eventually, however, the bunches punch through the retarding fields and oscillations cease abruptly. Reducing the beam velocity (voltage) will cause the tube to resume oscillation. However, it is necessary to reduce the beam velocity below the value at which oscillations ceased before oscillation will start again. This phenomenon is known as hysteresis and is similar to that observed in many reflex klystrons.|$|E

We investigated the variability of twelve spectral lines by means of the temporal variance spectrum. The selected lines probe the radial structure of the atmosphere from the photosphere to the outer wind. We also performed a spectroscopic analysis with atmosphere models to derive the stellar and wind properties and to constrain the formation region of the selected lines. Results. We show that variability is observed in the wind lines of all bright giants and superelants on a daily tiniescale. Lines formed in the photosphere are sometimes variable, sometimes not The dwarf stars do not show any sign of variability, If variability is observed on a daily timescale, it can also (but not always) be observed on hourly timescales, albeit with lower amplitude. There is a very clear correlation between amplitude of the variability and fraction of the fine formed in the wind. Strong anti-correlations between the different parts of the temporal variance spectrum are observed. Conclusions. Our results indicate that variability is stronger in lines formed in the wind. A link between photospheric and wind variability is not obvious from our study, since wind variability is observed regardless of the level of photospheric variability. Different photospheric lines also show different degrees of variability...|$|R
