A clearly labeled storage board lets the employee know exactly where a tool belongs and what tools are missing from the display board. Another simple example of a common visual control is to have reminders posted on cubicle walls so that they remain in plain sight. <b>Visual</b> <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>signals</b> communicate information that is needed to make effective decisions. These decisions may be safety oriented or they may give reminders as to what steps should be taken to resolve a problem. Most companies use visual controls in one degree or another, many of them not even realizing that the visual controls that they are making have a name and a function in the workplace. Whether it is recognized by the name of [...] "visual control" [...] or not, the fact is that replacing text or number with graphics makes a set of information easier to understand with only a glance, making it a more efficient way of communicating a message.|$|E

In no case did winglessness of either females or males prevent mating altogether, though there were varying reductions of mating frequency with winglessness.

In no case did winglessness of either females or males prevent mating altogether, though there were varying reductions of mating frequency with winglessness. Wingless males of D. algonquin mated with winged females as well as winged males, while wingless females of this species mated with winged males significantly less often than did winged females. It does not appear that the male courtship wing display of D. algonquin provides an essential visual stimulus for mating. On the other hand, it seems likely that the female 2 ̆ 7 s appearance, including presence of wings, is important for the male 2 ̆ 7 s orientation just before copulation. Our data also suggest that winglessness influences mating by impairing auditory signals and, perhaps, by reducing mobility and coordination...|$|E

40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is {{a common}} {{disorder}} of middle-aged and elderly people, {{in which there is}} degeneration of the extra-pyramidal motor system. In some patients, the disease is associated with a range of <b>visual</b> <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> symptoms, including defects in visual acuity, colour vision, the blink reflex, pupil reactivity, saccadic and smooth pursuit movements and visual evoked potentials. In addition, there may be psychophysical changes, disturbances of complex visual functions such as visuospatial orientation and facial recognition, and chronic visual hallucinations. Some of the treatments associated with PD may have adverse ocular reactions. If visual problems are present, they can have an important effect on overall motor function, and quality of life of patients can be improved by accurate diagnosis and correction of such defects. Moreover, visual testing is useful in separating PD from other movement disorders with visual symptoms, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Although not central to PD, <b>visual</b> <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> symptoms can be an important though obscure aspect of the disease and should not be overlooked...|$|R
