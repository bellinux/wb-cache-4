40|$|Halogen-additives are cost {{effective}} flame retardants (FRs) that scavenge H? and OH? radicals {{in the gas}} phase, but are under significant scrutiny due to the toxic smoke they release and their potential to leach out into the environment and possibly bio accumulate. One fire retarding solution is using layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly, which is a simple, bottom-up processing technique, to create functional nanocoatings through sequential adsorption of materials with complementary functional groups {{for the purpose of}} inhibiting or suppressing the combustion cycle. Inspiration for first applying polymer/clay thin films (i. e., nanobrick walls) as flame retardant (FR) coatings to polyurethane foam via LbL came from the final stage of a proposed flame suppression mechanism in a melt-mixture of polymer and clay, which depicts a physical barrier created from the build-up of impermeable flakes and carbonized char. Intumescing nanobrick wall assemblies comprised of nitrogen and phosphorus-containing polymers (mortar) and clay platelets (bricks) were deposited on flexible polyurethane foam using layer-by-layer assembly. Four trilayers of the poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) /poly(phosphate sodium salt) (PSP) /montmorillonite (MMT) nanobrick wall assembly (< 3 wt% coating addition) are necessary to cut the pkHRR of polyether-based polyurethane by 54. 8 %, relative to control, uncoated foam. The influence of clay aspect ratio and composition on fire behavior of coated polyurethane foam was studied as a function of polymer/clay (montmorillonite or vermiculite (VMT)) layers deposited and nanocoating weight addition. A single bilayer (BL) of polyethylenimine (PEI) and formulated-vermiculite clay, which adds only 3. 2 wt% to the foam, successfully prevented formation of a melt pool of burning polymer and reduced peak heat release rate and total smoke release by 54 % and 31 %, respectively. MMT-nanobrick walls require 4 BL to match the fire performance of single BL VMT-nanobrick walls. Aqueous coacervation was investigated as a single step process to deposit flame retardant nanocoatings on textiles quickly. Cotton soaked in environmentally-benign PSP/PEI complex for 1 min resulted in a 16. 7 % residue after <b>vertical</b> <b>flame</b> <b>testing</b> and a 52. 7 % reduction in total heat release in comparison to uncoated cotton in micro combustion calorimetry.

In situ {{measurement of the}} temperature gradient in the cone calorimeter were combined with infrared spectroscopy measurements on specimens withdrawn and quenched {{at different times of}} the experiment. The reactions that govern the degradation at the high heating rates met in the combustion could be determined and the gap to analytical techniques such as thermogravimetry bridged. The interplay of mechanical char integrity and heat feedback by the flame determined how much time the specimen dwells in temperature range of 300 to 420 C where char expansion due to calcium salt formation is effective and thereby affects the heat release rate strongly. Vertical cone calorimeter and <b>vertical</b> <b>flame</b> <b>testing</b> were used to assess melt dripping and char stability under flaming combustion. Plateeplate rheological measurements proofed to be of limited use to compare the effect of different degradation atmospheres on the melt viscosity.

40|$|A novel flame {{retardant}} diethyl 4 -methylpiperazin- 1 -ylphosphoramidate (CN- 3) containing phosphorous and nitrogen was prepared. Its chemical structure {{was confirmed by}} nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H-, 13 C-, and 31 P-NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Print cloth and twill fabrics were treated with CN- 3 to achieve different levels of add-on (7 – 22 wt% add-ons for print cloth and 3 – 18 wt% add-ons for twill). Thermogravimetric analysis, <b>vertical</b> <b>flame</b> <b>test,</b> and limiting oxygen index (LOI) were performed on the treated cotton fabrics and showed promising results. When the treated print cloth and twill fabric samples were tested using the <b>vertical</b> <b>flame</b> <b>test</b> (ASTM D 6413 - 08), we observed that the ignited fabrics self-extinguished and left behind a streak of char. Treated higher add-ons fabrics were neither consumed by flame nor produced glowing ambers upon self-extinguishing.

LOI values increased from 18 vol% oxygen in nitrogen for untreated print cloth and twill fabrics to maximum of 28 and 31 wt% for the highest add-ons of print cloth and twill, respectively. The results from cotton fabrics treated with CN- 3 demonstrated a higher LOI value as well as a higher char yield because of the effectiveness of phosphorus and nitrogen as a flame retardant for cotton fabrics. Furthermore, FT-IR and SEM were used to characterize the chemical structure on the treated fabrics as well as the surface morphology of char areas of treated and untreated fabrics...|$|E

The aim of this report is to investigate some basic properties of films made from nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) and Lycopodium spores with a specific focus on flame retardant and mechanical properties. These properties were investigated using machines such as SEM, a universal electromechanical tester, TGA and <b>vertical</b> <b>flame</b> <b>testing.</b> During {{the production of the}} films an ultra turrax, rotavapor and rapid köthen was used.

An increased spore-ratio shows a decreased Young’s modulus. Further research on flame retardancy could be done using xyloglucan or another more flame retardant organic compound as a matrix.

40|$|The study {{deals with}} the {{chemical}} and flame retardant (FR) treatment of woven flax fabric and preparation and characterization of flax reinforced phenolic composites. Sheets of flax fabric were subjected to chemical treatments using NaOH and silane coupling agents. A phosphate-based flame retardant (DAP) was applied to decrease the flammability of the flax fabric. The effect of the chemical treatments and FR treatments on the thermal and flammability properties of the fabric and composites was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), <b>vertical</b> <b>flame</b> resistance <b>test</b> and cone calorimeter. The mechanical properties of the flax fabric and composites, before and after environmental ageing, were investigated. Ageing {{studies were carried out}} by exposing the samples in an environmental chamber at specified conditions for two weeks. TGA results showed that the treatment of the fabric with FR shifts the decomposition temperature to lower level and increases the char residue. <b>Vertical</b> <b>flame</b> resistance <b>testing</b> showed that FR treatment of the flax fabric improved the flammability properties. There was no after flame and afterglow observed for FR treated flax fabric due to self-extinguishment after removal of the flame. Flax Fabric without FR burned completely and there was no result for the char length due to the complete destruction of the fabric. The FR treatment, however, seemed to have had a negative effect on the tensile strength of the flax fabric. This was further intensified upon exposure of FR treated flax fabric to high temperatures during ageing studies which drastically reduced the tensile strength by more than 90 %, and the flax fabric were found to be brittle and darker in visual appearance. TGA results of flax/phenolic composites showed that for composites containing chemically treated and FR treated flax fabric the decomposition temperatures shifted to lower temperatures; however {{there was no significant difference}} in the amount of char residue. Untreated flax/phenolic composites exhibited the lowest char residue. Cone calorimeter results showed that the peak heat release rate (PHRR), smoke production rate (SPR) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission rate was reduced for the flax/phenolic composite produced using FR treated flax fabric. The tensile strength of these composites was reduced while there was an increase in modulus value. Exposure of the FR treated composites to high temperatures further reduced the tensile strength and increased the E-modulus. Both FR treated and untreated composites changed in colour and the FR treated composites were found to be brittle after exposure to high temperatures...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{materials}} were used to fabricate nanocoatings using layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly to reduce the flammability of cotton fabric. The most effective brominated flame retardants have raised concerns related to their toxicity and environmental impact, which has created a need for alternative flame retardant chemistries and approaches. Polymer nanocomposites typically exhibit reduced mass loss and heat release rates, along with anti-dripping behavior, {{all of which are}} believed to be due to the formation of a barrier surface layer. Despite these benefits, the viscosity and modulus of the final polymeric material is often altered, making industrial processing difficult. These challenges inspired the use of LbL assembly to create densely layered nanocomposites in an effort to produce more flame-retardant coatings. Laponite and montmorillonite (MMT) clay were paired with branched poly(ethylenimine) to create thin film assemblies that can be tailored by changing pH and concentration of aqueous deposition mixtures. Both films can be grown linearly as a function of layers deposited, and they contained at least 70 wt percent of clay. When applying these films to cotton fabric, the individual fibers are uniformly coated and the fabric has significant char left after burning. MMT-coated fabric exhibits reduced total heat release, suggesting a protective ceramic surface layer is created. Small molecule, POSS-based LbL thin films were also successfully deposited on cotton fabric. With less than 8 wt percent added to the total fabric weight, more than 12 wt percent char remained after microscale combustion calorimetry. Furthermore, afterglow time was reduced and the fabric weave structure and shape of the individual fibers were highly preserved following <b>vertical</b> <b>flame</b> <b>testing.</b> A silica-like sheath was formed after burning that protected the fibers. Finally, the first intumescent LbL assembly was deposited on cotton fabric. SEM images show significant bubble formation on fibers, coated with a 0. 5 wt percent PAAm/ 1 wt percent PSP coating after burning. In several instances, a direct flame on the fabric was extinguished. The peak HRR and THR of coated fabric has 30 percent and 65 percent reduction, respectively, compared to the uncoated control fabric. These anti-flammable nanocoatings provide a relatively environmentally-friendly alternative for protecting fabrics, such as cotton, and lay the groundwork for rendering many other complex substrates (e. g., foam) flame-retardant without altering their processing and desirable mechanical behavior...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Highloft {{nonwovens}} are low density fabrics {{characterized by}} a high ratio of thickness to weight per unit area, which means that highlofts contain considerable void volume. They are usually made of synthetic fibers. The present research effort was directed to study cotton blended highlofts. The major problems with using cotton in highlofts are cotton’s high flammability and lack of resiliency. The objective {{of this research was}} to carry out single-bath chemical finishing of perpendicular-laid (P-laid) highlofts to afford the composites’ improved flame resistance (FR) and physical resiliency. We have developed two finishing formulations containing the flame retardants (a) diammonium phosphate (DAP) /urea, and (b) DAP and cyclic phosphonate ester along with the crosslinking agent DMDHEU. Both the formulations imparted flame resistance to the highly flammable highlofts, protecting them completely. However, the formulation containing DAP/urea is preferred because it is of lower cost. Using the <b>vertical</b> <b>flame</b> <b>test,</b> damage sustained was limited to charring {{in the vicinity of the}} instigating flame. The crosslinking agent was effective in improving compressional resistance and recovery. So, the finishing treatment produced P-laid cotton blend highlofts that were both FR and resilient.

40|$|An {{intumescent}} coating {{composed of a}} nitrogen-modified silane hybrid (SiN) and phytic acid (PA) was deposited on cotton fabric through layer-by-layer assembly {{in order to reduce}} flammability. SiN was synthesized via a sol–gel process and characterized by 29 Si-nuclear magnetic resonance. This {{intumescent coating}} system lowered the thermal stability of the cotton due to the catalyzed effect on degradation, but significantly improved the char formation. In a <b>vertical</b> <b>flame</b> <b>test,</b> fabrics coated with 15 bilayers (BLs) of SiN–PA extinguished the flame immediately upon removing the ignition source, while untreated cotton was completely burned out. Cone calorimeter data revealed that 15 BL-coated cotton resulted in a 31 % and 38 % reduction in peak heat release rate and total heat release, respectively, relative to those of the uncoated control. This superior fire retardant performance is believed to be attributed to the formation of intumescent char layer on fibers that could effectively inhibit the oxygen and heat permeation when burning. In addition, as evidenced by thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results, the increased amount of inflammable gases and the decreased amount of flammable gases during the degradation of coated cotton fabrics was another important factor to improve the flame resistance. These results demonstrate that the combination of layer-by-layer assembly and sol–gel method will provide an effective alternative to current flame retardant treatments...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} focused on {{enhancing}} the flame retardant behavior of cotton and polyurethane foam. Some of the most commonly used treatments (e. g., brominated compounds) have raised concerns with regard to toxicity and environmental persistence. These concerns have led to significant research into the use of alternative approaches, including polymer nanocomposites prepared from more environmentally benign nanoparticles. These particles migrate to the surface from the bulk during fire exposure to form a barrier on the surface that protects the underlying polymer. This theory of fire suppression in bulk nanocomposites inspired the use of layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly to create nanocoatings in an effort to produce more effective and environmentally-benign flame retardant treatments. Negatively charged silica nanoparticles of two different sizes were paired with either positively charged silica or cationic polyethylenimine (PEI) to create thin film assemblies. When applying these films to cotton fabric, all coated fabrics retained their weave structure after being exposed to a <b>vertical</b> <b>flame</b> <b>test,</b> while uncoated cotton was completely destroyed. Micro combustion calorimetry confirmed that coated fabrics exhibited a reduced peak heat release rate, by as much as 20 % relative to the uncoated control. Even so, this treatment would not pass the standard UL 94 <b>vertical</b> <b>flame</b> <b>test,</b> necessitating a more effective treatment. Positively- charged chitosan (CH) was paired with montmorillonite (MMT) clay to create a renewable flame retardant nanocoating for polyurethane foam. This coating system completely stops the melting of a flexible polyurethane foam when exposed to direct flame from a butane torch, with just 10 bilayers (~ 30 nm thick). The same coated foam exhibited a reduced peak heat release rate, by as much as 52 %, relative to the uncoated control. This same nanobrick wall coating is able to impart gas barrier to permeate plastic film. Multilayered thin films were assembled with "green" food contact approved materials (i. e., chitosan, polyacrylic acid (PAA) and montmorillonite clay). Only ten CH-PAA-CH-MMT quadlayers (~ 90 nm thick) cause polylactic acid (PLA) film to behave like PET in terms of oxygen barrier. A thirty bilayer CH-MMT assembly (~ 100 nm thick) on PLA exhibits an oxygen transmission rate (OTR) below the detection limit of commercial instrumentation (<= 0. 005 cm^ 3 /(m^ 2 *day*atm)). This is the same recipe used to impart flame retardant behavior to foam, but it did not provide effective FR to cotton fabric, so a very different recipe was used. Thin films of fully renewable electrolytes, chitosan and phytic acid (PA), were deposited on cotton fabric in an effort to reduce flammability through an intumescent effect. Altering the pH of aqueous deposition solutions modifies the composition of the final nanocoating. Fabrics coated with highest PA content multilayers completely extinguished the flame and reduced peak heat release (pkHRR) and total heat release of 60 % and 76 %, respectively. This superior performance is believed to be due to high phosphorus content that enhances the intumescent behavior of these nanocoatings...|$|E

Microcomposites based on PA and containing 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt. % of different lignins were prepared with a twin-screw extruder. Morphological analysis showed good interfacial interaction and uniform distribution of lignin particles within the resulting microcomposites. Further, thermogravimetric analyses carried out in inert atmosphere indicated that, unlike kraft lignin, which is able to give rise {{to the formation of}} lower char residue (41 - 48 wt. % at 600 °C), the sulphonated counterpart provides a higher thermal stability as well as a higher char residue (55 - 58 wt. %). Furthermore, <b>vertical</b> <b>flame</b> spread <b>tests</b> clearly showed that 15 wt. % is the optimum of kraft or sulphonated lignin loading to achieve improved flame retardant properties and V 1 rating. In addition, cone calorimeter was exploited to study forced combustion behaviour; in particular the microcomposites containing sulphonated lignin revealed a significant reduction of peak of heat release rate (- 51 %), of total heat release (- 23 %) and a lower average mass loss rate together with a noticeable increase of the final residual mass (about 9 wt. %). Conversely, the microcomposites containing kraft lignins showed opposite effect, since HRR and THR values increased in the presence of kraft lignin...|$|R

Particular attention is given to the factors that influence the ignitibility of the FPUF, including thermal resistance, permeability, and structural integrity of the barrier fabrics (BFs). A number of barrier fabrics, displaying a wide range of the properties, are tested with the BF-open <b>flame</b> <b>test.</b> Visual observations of the FPUF burning behavior and BF char patterns, in addition to heat flux measurements on the unexposed side of the barrier fabrics, are used to assess the protective performance of the BF specimen under the open <b>flame</b> <b>test</b> conditions.

30|$|A novel {{one-step}} synthetic route, {{the double}} in situ approach, {{has resulted in}} both TiO 2 nanoparticles and polymer (PET), leaving the nano-titania dispersed in the polymer as a nanocomposite. This was achieved by the release of water during the esterification reaction, forming polyester, which hydrolyzed the titanium (IV) butoxide forming nano-titania. Normally, this rapid reaction results in larger titania particles, {{but in this case}} it was inhibited by the polymer, which formed around each nonoparticle. Based on the observation of SEM and TEM images, TiO 2 nanoparticles form as spheres, which are uniformly dispersed in the polymer matrix, the diameters are mainly under 100 nm. In comparison with fire retarded properties of PET and PET-co-DDP, the performance of the nanocomposite formed by the double in situ approach resulted in a significant improvement: LOI value 32.6, UL- 94 rating V- 0. It is most notable that UL- 94 rating, which uses a <b>vertical</b> upward <b>flame</b> spread <b>test,</b> has been improved from V- 2 (PET-co-DDP) to V- 0 (PET-co-DDP/TiO 2 nanocomposite), although the total nanoparticle content is only 1 %. Essentially, this is a consequence of the increase in melt viscosity near the burning temperature reducing the tendency to drip. This novel approach overcomes two of the barriers to polymer nanocomposite formation—synthesis and agglomeration-prevention of nanoparticles, and ensuring nanodispersion within the polymer. This work is of significance to the preparation of polymer nanocomposites involving condensation polymerization, such as polyesters.|$|R
