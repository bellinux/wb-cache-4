A time discretization <b>error</b> <b>representation</b> is derived for the approximation {{of the associated}} value function. It concerns Symplectic Euler solutions of the Hamiltonian system connected with the optimal control problem. The <b>error</b> <b>representation</b> has a leading order term consisting of an error density that is computable from Symplectic Euler solutions. Under an assumption of the pathwise convergence of the approximate dual function as the maximum time step goes to zero, we prove that the remainder is of higher order than the leading error density part in the <b>error</b> <b>representation.</b> With the <b>error</b> <b>representation,</b> {{it is possible to}} perform adaptive time stepping. We apply an adaptive algorithm originally developed for ordinary differential equations. The performance is illustrated by numerical tests...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—An {{effective}} <b>visual</b> <b>error</b> concealment {{method has}} been presented by employing a robust rotation, scale, and translation (RST) invariant partial patch matching model (RSTI-PPMM) and exemplar-based inpainting. While the proposed robust and inherently feature-enhanced texture synthesis approach ensures the generation of excellent and perceptually plausible <b>visual</b> <b>error</b> concealment results, the outlier pruning property guarantees the significant quality improvements, both quantitatively and qualitatively. No intermediate user-interaction {{is required for the}} pre-segmented media and the presented method follows a bootstrapping approach for an automatic visual loss recovery and the image and video error concealment.

40|$|Neural {{systems that}} control {{movement}} maintain accuracy by adaptively altering motor commands {{in response to}} errors. It is often assumed that the error signal that drives adaptation {{is equivalent to the}} sensory error observed at the conclusion of a movement; for saccades, this is typically the <b>visual</b> (retinal) <b>error.</b> However, we instead propose that the adaptation error signal is derived as the difference between the observed <b>visual</b> <b>error</b> and a realistic prediction of movement outcome. Using a modified saccade-adaptation task in human subjects, we precisely controlled the amount of error experienced at the conclusion of a movement by back-stepping the target so that the saccade is hypometric (positive retinal error), but less hypometric than if the target had not moved (smaller retinal error than expected). This separates prediction <b>error</b> from both <b>visual</b> <b>errors</b> and motor corrections. Despite positive <b>visual</b> <b>errors</b> and forward-directed motor corrections, we found an adaptive decrease in saccade amplitudes, a finding that is well-explained by the employment of a prediction-based error signal. Furthermore, adaptive changes in movement size were linearly correlated to the disparity between the predicted and observed movement outcomes, in agreement with the forward-model hypothesis of motor learning, which states that adaptation error signals incorporate predictions of motor outcomes computed using a copy of the motor command (efference copy) ...|$|R
40|$|Anterior cingulate and dorsolateral {{prefrontal cortex}} (ACC and dlPFC, respectively) are core {{components}} of the cognitive control network. Activation of these regions is routinely observed in tasks that involve monitoring the external environment and maintaining information in order to generate appropriate responses. Despite the ubiquity of studies reporting coactivation of these two regions, a consensus on how they interact to support cognitive control has yet to emerge. In this letter, we present a new hypothesis and computational model of ACC and dlPFC. The <b>error</b> <b>representation</b> hypothesis states that multidimensional error signals generated by ACC in response to surprising outcomes are used to train <b>representations</b> of expected <b>error</b> in dlPFC, which are then associated with relevant task stimuli. <b>Error</b> <b>representations</b> maintained in dlPFC are in turn used to modulate predictive activity in ACC in order to generate better estimates of the likely outcomes of actions. We formalize the <b>error</b> <b>representation</b> hypothesis in a new computational model based on our previous model of ACC.

40|$|This study reports two Hebrew-speaking {{individuals}} with acquired visual dyslexia. They made predominantly <b>visual</b> <b>errors</b> in reading, in all {{positions of the}} target words. Although both of them produced <b>visual</b> <b>errors,</b> their reading patterns crucially differed in three respects. KD had almost exclusively letter substitutions, and SF also made letter omissions, additions, letterposition errors, and between-word migrations. KD had difficulties accessing abstract letter identity in single letter tasks, and in letter naming, unlike SF, who named letters well. KD did not show lexical effects such as frequency and orthographic neighborhood effects, and produced nonword responses, whereas SF showed lexical effects, with a strong tendency to produce word responses. We suggest that these two patterns stem from two different deficits – KD has letteridentity visual dyslexia, which results from a deficit in abstract letter identification in the orthographic-visual analysis system, yielding erroneous letter identities, whereas SF has visualoutput dyslexia, which results from a deficit at a later stage, a stage that combines the outputs of the various functions of the orthographic-visual analyzer.

40|$|In this thesis, {{multiple}} shooting {{methods for}} optimization problems constrained by partial differential equations are developed, and, furthermore, a posteriori error estimates and local mesh refinement techniques for {{these problems are}} derived. Two different approaches, {{referred to as the}} direct and the indirect multiple shooting approach, are developed. While the first approach applies multiple shooting to the constraining equation and sets up the optimality system afterwards, in the latter approach multiple shooting is applied to the optimality system of the optimization problem. The setup of both multiple shooting methods in a function space setting and their discrete analogs are discussed, and different solution and preconditioning techniques are investigated. Furthermore, <b>error</b> <b>representation</b> formulas based on Galerkin orthogonality are derived. They involve sensitivity analysis by means of an adjoint problem and employ standard <b>error</b> <b>representation</b> on subintervals combined with additional projection errors at the shooting nodes.

40|$|Data {{error is}} an {{obstacle}} to effective application, integration, and sharing of data. Error reduction, although desirable, is not always necessary or feasible. Error measurement is a natural alternative. In this paper, we outline an error propagation calculus which models the propagation of an <b>error</b> <b>representation</b> through queries. A closed set of three error types is defined: attribute value inaccuracy (and nulls), object mismembership in a class, and class incompleteness. Error measures are probability distributions over these error types. Given measures of error in query inputs, the calculus both computes and &quot;explains &quot; error in query outputs, so that users and administrators better understand data error. Error propagation is non-trivial as error may be amplified or diminished through query partitions and aggregations. As a theoretical foundation, this work suggests managing error in practice by instituting measurement of persistent tables and extending database output to include a quantitative error term, akin to the confidence interval of a statistical estimate.
