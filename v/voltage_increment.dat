Feedback control is achieved using a retrospective cost adaptive controller, which adjusts control gains by minimizing a quadratic function of the retrospective performance and requires knowledge of nonminimum-phase (NMP) zeros (i. e., the complex numbers with magnitude greater than one where the transfer function equals zero) of the linearized flow-actuator model.

However, with the continuous increase of installed grid-connected PVPPs, power system operators have been experiencing new challenges, like overloading, overvoltages and operation during grid voltage disturbances. Consequently, constant power generation (CPG) is imposed by grid codes. An algorithm for the calculation of the photovoltaic panel voltage reference, which generates a constant power from the PVPP, is introduced in this paper.

We find that Kv 1. 1, Kv 1. 4, Kv 1. 5, and Kv 1. 6 have similar activation and deactivation kinetics. The k+ currents produced by step depolarisations increase with a sigmoidal time course that can be described by a delay and by the derivative of the current at the inflection point. The delay tends to zero and the logarithmic derivative seems to approach a finite value at large positive voltages, but these asymptotic values are not yet reached at + 80 mV. Deactivation of the currents upon stepping to negative membrane potentials below - 60 mV is fairly well described by a single exponential. The decrease of the deactivation time constant at increasingly negative voltages tends to become less steep, indicating that this parameter also has a finite limiting value, which is not yet reached, however, at - 160 mV.

The minimal energy necessary for defibrillation (defibrillation threshold) was determined inlraoperatively in 21 volunteer patients undergoing accessory pathway ablation of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Ventricular fibrillation was induced with alternating current. Ten seconds after fibrillation onset defibrillation shocks were begun using either the single or the sequential pulse technique with stored <b>voltage</b> <b>incremented</b> until defibrillation was accomplished (de-fibrillation threshold). Selection of the use of a single or sequential pulse technique for the initial attempt was randomized. Defibrillation thresholds were determined in three groups of patients: I) those with four small mesh electrodes (6 cm 2), 2) those with two small and two large (13 cm 2) mesh electrodes, and 3) those with four large mesh electrodes. In all cases, the average minimal energy needed for sequential pulse defibrillation was less than that required for single pulse defibrillation in the same patients with the same electrodes (four small, 24. 8 ± 24. 7 J single versus 6. 7 ± 8. 3 J sequential; two small plus two large, 11. 4 ± 15. 0 J single versus 2. 7 ± 1. 4 J sequential; four large, 8. 1 ± 5. 3 J single versus 3. 9 ± 2. 6 J sequential). Using the 6 cm 2 electrodes for single pulse defibrillation energies delivered at > 45 J in two patients failed to defibrillate the heart. In addition, when at least one large mesh electrode was used for the sequential pulse system, the maximal defibrillalion threshold was 9. 25 J (range 1. 08 to 9. 25).
