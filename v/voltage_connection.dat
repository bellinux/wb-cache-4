50|$|It is {{believed}} that RCA only made 4000 CT-100 receivers. Around 150 survive, but only 30 are restored and working. The Early Television Museum in Hilliard, Ohio has a restored and working set on display, as does the SPARK Museum of Electrical Invention in Bellingham, Washington. One reason for the rarity of surviving sets is that the RCA-developed tri-color cathode ray tube (the 15GP22) {{that was used in}} the CT-100 was notorious for its glass-to-metal seals breaking down, causing the tube to lose its vacuum. It is extremely rare to find tubes that still work. The 15G was a glass tube, but its high <b>voltage</b> <b>connection</b> is a metal ring between the face of the tube and the glass bell.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} the design of shell-type, single-phase distribution transformers to obtain the manufacturing specifications. The method is simple, efficient and accurate. By an exhaustive analysis, it is concluded that the obtained solution is the global optimum. The following constraints are imposed: excitation current, no-load losses, total losses, impedance and efficiency. The methodology of this paper requires only six input data: transformer rating, low voltage, high <b>voltage,</b> <b>connection</b> of low-voltage coil, connection of high-voltage coil, and frequency. These data are included in the transformer nameplate. In this paper, the minimization of the following four objective functions is considered: total owing cost, mass, total losses and material cost. The consideration of these four objective functions is implemented automatically by running the optimization algorithm four times without intervention of a designer. Consequently, transformer manufacturers save designman-hours and increase capacity. A design example on a 25 kVA transformer is presented for illustration. The optimized solutions of transformer design are validated with laboratory and process measurements. © Springer-Verlag 2011...|$|E

The results we obtained point out that the secondary electron emission enhanced on incident beam energy and on the angle with respect to the normal direction of the surface.

Several basic requirements are needed to commercialise MRE in coastal regions: •	adequate primary resource within an economic distance from the shore; •	accessible and available harbour facilities; •	a practicable onshore high <b>voltage</b> <b>connection</b> (with available capacity); •	an absence of any strongly prohibitive environmental sensitivity There are also many legal, economic and other social considerations, such as predominant marine spatial designations, public acceptability and regional political agendas, that need to be both understood and aligned correctly before project development justifies commercial pursuit. The many risks associated with these non-technical factors are multiplied when considering less mature MRE technologies such as wave, tidal and floating wind, and their higher associated costs (e. g. design liability, insurance, deployment). Additionally, remote and peripheral regions see complicating factors arise from a range of geographical limitations on accessibility, communications, skills/employment difficulties and other potentially problematic logistics (Trama TecnoAmbiental et al., 2012). Cumulatively, the hurdles associated with MRE commercialisation in remote and peripheral regions can be substantial. Opportunities for cost and risk reduction within the development and market growth stage can enable or block successful deployment. This paper identifies some of the opportunities for collaborative learning and cost reduction emerging from a two stage stakeholder consultation process carried out in Cornwall, UK and Finistère, France. This covers opportunities within the application of legal and regulatory compliance, innovation and business support policy, social and educational policy opportunities and the identification of specific technology areas that (from a non-technical perspective) present opportunities for collaboration and exploitation for mutual benefit, such as complementary assets or relative levels of technology maturity. It {{should be noted that the}} opportunities identified are not certainties. They have ‘potential’ in that if adopted they may reduce the overall non-technical hurdles (and therefore risk and cost as mentioned earlier) to commercialisation of MRE within both regions, and relative to being overcome separately. This is likely only if adequate funding, time and commitment is provided, and most likely with the leadership and support of key public sector bodies...|$|E

Cable capacity has been improved by the choice for a thinner lead screen as well as increased use of cross-bonding. A cross-bonding box has been developed that allows capacity to be increased significantly at limited additional costs.
