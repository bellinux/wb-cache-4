It is also shown that elevated shear stresses occur in the vicinity of the upstream surface of the open occluder.

40|$|Water hammer {{phenomenon}} {{involves the}} transformation of kinetic energy in pressure energy, this transformation occurs as the fluid conditions change inside the pipe in quite a short time. Industry requires to affront frequent flow interruptions in pipe systems due to the closing of valves or stopping of pumping equipment. This phenomenon can initiate serious damages like destruction of the pipe system involving leakage of the working fluid to the environment.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new type of {{hydraulic}} valve: an adjustable-ratio flow divider. This <b>valve</b> attempts to <b>split</b> one input flow into two output flows in a predetermined ratio, independent of load pressure or total flow. The valve uses a two dimensional structure to form a two-stage valve with only one moving part; the pilot stage uses the spool s rotary position, and the main stage uses its linear position. This arrangement allows for a cheaper, simpler valve with smaller volumes (translating into faster response). The ratio of outlet flows can be set on the fly by the angular position of the spool, driven by a stepper motor or other low-power input. In order to evaluate the initial feasibility of the concept, steady state and dynamic models were developed and the effects of the physical parameters were studied. Two non-linear non-derivative multiobjective optimization strategies were used to determine the optimum parameters for a prototype.

60|$|I {{will now}} proceed {{to a general}} {{description}} of the different parts and organs in the Lepadidæ. The Capitulum is usually much flattened, but sometimes broadly oval in section. It is generally formed of five or more valves, connected together by very narrow or broad strips of membrane; sometimes the valves are rudimental or absent, when the whole consists of membrane. When the valves are numerous, and they occasionally exceed a hundred in number, they are arranged in whorls, with each valve generally so placed as to cover the interval between the two valves above. Of all the valves, the scuta are the most persistent; then come the terga, and then the carina; the rostrum and latera occur only in Scalpellum and Pollicipes, and in a rudimentary condition in Lithotrya, and, perhaps, in the fossil genus Loricula. The valves are formed sometimes of chitine (as in Ibla and Alepas), but usually of shell, which varies from transparency to entire opacity. The shell is generally white, occasionally reddish or purple; exteriorly, the valves are covered by more or less persistent, generally yellow, strong membrane. The scuta and terga are always considerably larger than the other valves: in the different genera the valves differ so much in shape that little can be predicated of them in common; even the direction of their lines of growth differs,--thus, in Lepas and some allied genera, the chief growth of the scuta and of the carina is upwards, whereas in Pollicipes and Lithotrya, it is entirely downwards; in Oxynaspis, and some species of Scalpellum, it is both upwards and downwards. Even in the same species, there is often very considerable variation in the exact shape of the valves, more especially of the terga. The adductor muscle is always attached to a point {{not far from the}} middle of the scuta, and it generally has a pit for its attachment. In several genera, namely, Pæcilasma, Dichelaspis, Conchoderma, and Alepas, the scuta show a tendency to be bilobed or trilobed. The valves are placed either at some distance from each other, or close together; but their growing margins very rarely overlap each other, though this is sometimes the case with their upper, free, tile-like apices; in a few species the scuta and terga are articulated together, or united by a fold. The membrane connecting the valves, where they do not touch each other, is like that forming the peduncle, and is sometimes brilliantly coloured crimson-red; generally, it appears blueish-gray, from the corium being seen through. Small pointed spines, connected with the underlying corium by tubuli, are not unfrequently articulated on this membrane: the tubuli, however, are often present where there are no spines. To allow of the growth of the capitulum, the membrane between the <b>valves</b> <b>splits</b> at each period of exuviation, when a new strip of membrane is formed beneath, connected on each side with a fresh layer of shell,--the old and outer slips of membrane disintegrating and disappearing: when there are many valves, the line of splitting is singularly complicated. This membrane consists of chitine,[13] and is composed of numerous fine laminæ. After the valves have been placed in acid, a residue, very different in bulk in different genera, is left, also composed of successive laminæ of chitine. It appears to me that each single lamina of calcified chitine, composing the shell, must once have been continuous with a non-calcified lamina in the membrane connecting the several valves: at the line where this change in calcification supervenes, the chitine generally assumes some colour, and becomes much harder and more persistent; and as the whole valve is formed of component laminæ thus edged (the once continuous laminæ of non-calcified chitine connecting the valves, having disintegrated and disappeared) the surfaces of the valves are generally left covered by a persistent membrane, constituted of these edgings: this membrane has been called the epidermis. In some genera, as in Lepas, this so-called epidermis is seldom preserved, excepting on the last zone of growth: in Scalpellum and Pollicipes it usually covers the whole valves. It appears to me that the laminæ of chitine, and of calcified chitine composing the valves, are both formed not by secretion, but by the metamorphosis of an outer layer of corium into these substances.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Radiometals {{are finding}} {{more and more}} {{applications}} in molecular imaging and targeted therapy. For PET imaging, all the novel radiometals are directly or indirectly produced on cyclotrons. Key step in their production is achieving proper radionuclidic, radiochemical and chemical purity, as well as high specific activity. Automation of the process enhances reproducibility, shortens necessary operations and decreases radiation burden. We have, therefore, developed universal radio-metal automated laboratory workbench (RALW) that is focused on separation processes from solid and liquid (solution) targets via solid phase extraction (SPE). Material and Methods RALW is versatile platform for separation, formulation and simple labeling processes. The following FIG. 1 displays its basic scheme. RALW´s main parts are: two reactors, two selec-tors, peristaltic pump, 3 / 2 way valves, and separation column. Prime reactor R 1 is designed to carry out several functions. It can transport solid target material from shielding container to process position, or handle liquid target filling. In both cases, the reactor is leakagefree up to 5 bars. There are 4 positions available to bring solvents to the reactor 1 or applying on a SPE column according to the separation sequence with use of peristaltic pump. Smart software allows for collecting defined fractions leaving the column, e. g. enriched target matrix and the desired radionuclide, by monitoring activity profile and controlling the <b>splitting</b> <b>valves.</b> The system also minimizes losses during transport of the solvents/fractions to the reactor R 2 and the software also controls final volume settings (activity concentration) of the product. Up to three positions are available for bringing solvents/solutions to the reactor R 2 for formulation or simple labeling steps like chelation. The system’s hardware is driven by a PLC and I/O cards. The PLC is placed outside the module to avoid radiation damage. The module, PLC and host PC communicate via an Ethernet cable. This solution significantly reduced number of cables connecting the module with other component in the control chain. The PLC is controlled via host PC equipped with userfriendly interface. Results and Conclusion The presented RPLW system is rather versatile tool for separation of metal radionuclides and simple postprocessing (formulation/labelling) of the product in stable environment and easy control mechanisms. The RPLW operating prototype is shown on the FIG. 2...|$|R

In this thesis, {{the focus is}} to study control and operation of such arrangements for three and four product separation. The study comprises of mainly simulation study for the Petlyuk arrangements while for the four-product Kaibel arrangement, simulation as well as experimental works are reported. The first contribution deals with selecting control structures for a three- product Petlyuk (dividing-wall) column. Alternate control structures are considered, with and without the vapor split as a degree of freedom. This work also demonstrates {{the usefulness of the}} graphical Vmin diagram to visualize minimum boilup requirement and choose the appropriate control structure. Next, for a four-product Kaibel column separating methanol, ethanol, propanol and n-butanol, a start-up procedure and steady state operation is demonstrated using experimental setup. A control structure with four temperature controllers is used for control and it can handle feed rate dis- turbances as well as setpoint changes. The experiment data also compares well with an equilibrium stage model. Dividing-wall distillation columns offer large potential energy savings over conventional column sequences, typically up to 30 % for three-product (Petlyuk) columns and 40 % for four-product (Kaibel) columns. However, the energy required for a separation depends on using an optimal vapor split. Hence, the energy saving potential may be lost if the column is operated away from its optimal point, for example, due to feed composition changes. The following work demonstrates experimentally that the vapor split can be effectively used as a degree of freedom during operation for example, for temperature control in the prefractionator section. Together with an adjustable liquid split, the vapor split control allows for minimizing the energy requirements. Finally, a control study on a four-product extended Petlyuk column op- erating close to minimum energy is reported. The study assumes an “ideal” case with all steady state degrees of freedom available for control, including the vapor <b>split</b> <b>valves,</b> which is required to achieve minimum energy under all conditions. Four decentralized control structures are proposed and tested against a wide range of disturbances. This work demonstrates again the use of the graphical V min tool which can be used to visualize the minimum boilup requirement for four-product Petlyuk arrangements.
