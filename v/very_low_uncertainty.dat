50|$|If a plasma is cooled {{and under}} {{increasing}} pressure, {{it will eventually}} {{not be possible to}} compress the plasma any further. This is by the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two fermions cannot share the same quantum state. When in this highly compressed state, since there is no extra space for any particles, a particle's location is extremely defined. Since the locations of the particles of a highly compressed plasma have <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> their momentum is extremely uncertain. This is due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, ΔpΔx ≥ ħ/2, where Δp is the uncertainty in the particle's momentum and Δx is the uncertainty in position. Therefore, even though the plasma is cold, such particles must on average be moving very fast. This leads to the conclusion that, in order to compress an object into a very small space, tremendous force is required to control its particles' momentum.|$|E

The vibration national standards developed by the Vibration Laboratory at INMETRO will be presented in details. These national standards comprehend primary interferometric calibration systems, which allow the calibration of the sensitivity of reference accelerometers under sinusoidal excitation with <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in the frequency range between 10 Hz and 10 kHz. These systems apply different signal processing techniques, as the fringe counting method, the minimum-point method and the sine-approximation method. Currently, the complex sensitivity can be determined with uncertainties of 0, 25 % for magnitude and 0, 25 degrees for phase shift at the reference frequency of 160 Hz. The compliance with the stated uncertainties by INMETRO and the degree of equivalence with other leading National Metrology Institutes have been positively verified through interlaboratory comparisons, as will be shown. Since these calibration systems hold the highest position in the Brazilian metrological hierarchy, they are important for all vibration measurements developed in the country, which need traceability, high accuracy and international recognition. Among the many applications that can benefit from these systems, we can cite for example: experimental modal analysis, FEM model update, comparison calibration of dynamic transducers, etc. Comparison methods against accelerometers calibrated by INMETRO can then be employed by accredited and non-accredited secondary calibration laboratories o...|$|E

The system is fully automated, very portable and light weighted (~ 0. 6 kg).

In the current configuration, the system has a measurement range of ± 2 mm, and its calibration using a modified Michelson interferometer has showed an uncertainty U 95 = ± 0. 008 mm.

40|$|Visual {{detection}} performance (d') is usually an accelerating function of stimulus contrast, which could imply a smooth, threshold-like nonlinearity in the sensory response. Alternatively, Pelli (1985 Journal of the Optical Society of America A 2 1508 - 1532) developed the 'uncertainty model' in which responses were linear with contrast, but the observer was uncertain about which of many noisy channels contained the signal. Such internal uncertainty effectively adds noise to weak signals, and predicts the nonlinear psychometric function. We re-examined these ideas by plotting psychometric functions (as z-scores) for two observers (SAW, PRM) with high precision. The {{task was to}} detect a single, vertical, blurred line at the fixation point, or identify its polarity (light vs dark). Detection of a known polarity was nearly linear for SAW but very nonlinear for PRM. Randomly interleaving light and dark trials reduced performance and rendered it non-linear for SAW, but had little effect for PRM. This occurred for both single-interval and 2 AFC procedures. The whole pattern of results was well predicted by our Monte Carlo simulation of Pelli's model, with only two free parameters. SAW (highly practised) had <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> PRM (with little prior practice) had much greater uncertainty, resulting in lower contrast sensitivity, nonlinear performance, and no effect of external (polarity) uncertainty. For SAW, identification was about v 2 better than detection, implying statistically independent channels for stimuli of opposite polarity, rather than an opponent (light - dark) channel. These findings strongly suggest that noise and uncertainty, rather than sensory nonlinearity, limit visual detection...|$|E
40|$|Modeling {{soil water}} flow {{requires}} {{the knowledge of}} numerous parameters associated to the water content and the soil hydraulic properties. Direct estimations of those parameters in laboratory require expensive equipment and the obtained parameters are generally not representative at the field scale because of the limitation of core sample size. Indirect methods such as inverse modeling are known to get efficient estimations and are easier {{to set up and}} process for large-scale studies. In this study, we investigated the capacity of an inverse modeling procedure to estimate the soil and the bedrock hydrodynamic properties only from in situ soil water content measurements at multiple depths under natural conditions. Multi-objective parameter optimization was performed using the HYDRUS- 1 D software and an external optimization procedure based on the NSGA-II algorithm. In a midslope shallow soil, water content was monitored at 3 depths, 20, 40, and 60 cm during 12 intense rainfall events, whose amounts ranged between 50 and 250 mm and duration between 1 and 5 days. The vertical profile was considered as 2 layers of soils above a third layer representing the weathered schist rock. This deep layer acted as a deep boundary condition, which features the bedrock permeability and water storage. Each layer was described trough the 6 parameters of the Mualem-van Genuchten formulation. The calibrated parameters appeared to have <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>uncertainty</b> while allowing a good modelisation of the observed water content variations. The calibrated saturated water content was close to the laboratory porosity measurements while the saturated hydraulic conductivity showed that the soil was highly permeable, as measured in the field. The inverse modeling approach allowed an estimation of the hydraulic properties of the bedrock layer where no measurement was available. The bedrock layer was found to have a low saturated hydraulic conductivity (< 5 mm h(- 1)), which means that the schist bedrock is poorly weathered and that saturated area can be generated above this depth, as it was observed. The simulated water contents were generally close to the measured water contents, but the model failed sometimes to reproduce the saturation of the soil in the deeper layers, probably because of sub-surface flux at the soil/bedrock interface. In these cases, further investigation will have to be made by using a 2 D-model...|$|E

One of the prospective ways to increase the oil production is to maximize the oil recovery from mature oil fields. In this study we apply an integrated approach that combines geostatistical reservoir description and reservoir simulation to evaluate infill drilling scenarios to maximize the secondary oil recovery from a Colombian oil field. A geostatistical simulation technique called Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGS) is used to generate fine-scale realizations of permeability for a waterflood pattern of La Cira field in Colombia, South America. This fine scale permeability field is upscaled to yield a coarser grid and input into a 3 D simulation model. A selected fine-scale permeability realization of 100 layers was upscaled to a coarse 6 -layer model using a power averaging approach. Two upscaled models were constructed: one using a power average with combined harmonic and arithmetic average with power exponent of 0. 5, and the other using an arithmetic average with a power exponent of I. O. Three-dimensional numerical simulations were performed for history matching of 53 years of production performance of the waterflood pattern LC- 1210. Three simulation cases were matched: 1. Using smooth interpolation for generating permeability distributions. 2. Using the geostatistical upscaled permeability model with a power average of 0. 5. 3. Using the geostatistical upscale permeability field with arithmetic average. permeability the best history match was obtained with the arithmetic-average model.

The 'base" case (under current injection conditions) represented an additional oil recovery of 4. 5 % in 20 years (1993 - 2013). The best infill scenario consisted of drilling one production well in the west side of the waterflood pattern LC- 1 2 1 0.

Concave {{ophthalmic}} applicators with 106 Ru/ 106 Rh beta sources are the more used for treatment of these eye lesions, mainly lesions with small and medium dimensions. The available treatment planning system for 106 Ru applicators is based on dose distributions on a homogeneous water sphere eye model, resulting in a lack of data in the literature of dose distributions in the eye radiosensitive structures, information that may be crucial to improve the treatment planning process, aiming the maintenance of visual acuity. Methods : The Monte Carlo code MCNPX was used to calculate the dose distribution in a complete mathematical model of the human eye containing a choroid melanoma; considering the eye actual dimensions and its various component structures, due to an ophthalmic brachytherapy treatment, using 106 Ru/ 106 Rh beta-ray sources. Two possibilities were analyzed; a simple water eye and a heterogeneous eye considering all its structures. Two concave applicators, CCA and CCB manufactured by BEBIG and a complete mathematical model of the human eye were modeled using the MCNPX code. Results and Conclusion : For both eye models, namely water model and heterogeneous model, mean dose values simulated for the same eye regions are, in general, very similar, excepting for regions very distant from the applicator, where mean dose values are <b>very</b> <b>low,</b> <b>uncertainties</b> are higher and relative differences may reach 20. 4 %. For the tumor base and the eye structures closest to the applicator, such as sclera, choroid and retina, the maximum difference observed was 4 %, presenting the heterogeneous model higher mean dose values. For the other eye regions, the higher doses were obtained when the homogeneous water eye model is taken into consideration. Mean dose distributions determined for the homogeneous water eye model are similar to those obtained for the heterogeneous eye model, indicating that the homogeneous water eye model is a reasonable one. The determined isodose curves give a good visualization of dose distributions inside the eye structures, pointing out their most exposed volume. [...] .

The risk reduction options evaluated by the Panel are those addressing either the sanitary status of the propagation material (including the provisions of 2000 / 29 /EC Annex IIAII and Annex IB, statutory certification system and the use of voluntary industry standards) or those addressing the control of TSWV epidemic development through actions directed at the virus or at its vectors (including cultural methods to reduce crop infestation and chemical or biological control of thrips vectors). Limitations of the current measures and the potential consequences of repealing the current legislation are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{assessed}} {{the risk to}} plant health of Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV), Strawberry latent ringspot virus (SLRSV), Raspberry ringspot virus (RpRSV) and Tomato black ring virus (TBRV) for the European Union (EU) territory, and evaluated the current EU legislation and possible risk reduction options. These viruses are largely restricted to Europe and their vector nematodes and at-risk hosts occur widely in Europe. Plants for planting were identified as the most significant entry pathway and the probability of entry is rated as unlikely to moderately likely for ArMV and as very unlikely to unlikely for RpRSV, SLRSV and TBRV. These ratings have moderate uncertainty. The probability of establishment is rated <b>very</b> likely with <b>low</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> The probability of local spread by natural means is likely, with <b>low</b> to medium <b>uncertainty,</b> whereas that of human-assisted long-distance spread is unlikely to moderately likely, with high uncertainty. Potential impact is rated minimal to minor in all hosts, {{with the exception of}} ArMV in grapevine, for which it is minor to moderate. These ratings have medium or high uncertainty. The current legislation addresses only two of the many host species of these viruses, but other weaknesses were also identified. If the current legislation were removed, no major consequences would be expected unless the industry simultaneously ceased its voluntary certification activity. Prohibition and the use of phytosanitary certificates, if covering the complete host ranges of the viruses and relying on appropriate tests, are the options with highest effectiveness against the risk of introduction whereas certification schemes and pest-free areas or production sites are those with the highest effectiveness against the spread and impact risks. All options have limitations in feasibility, with uncertainty ratings from moderate to high. The combination of partially effective options may be highly effective in some crop...|$|R
50|$|For example, {{consider}} the case of a prospective air traveller. Most of us know that the probability of being involved in an airline disaster is <b>low</b> (<b>low</b> <b>uncertainty).</b> It is conventional wisdom that travellers are safer in the air than on the roads. Statistically, you {{are much more likely to}} be involved in a vehicular accident that an aircraft disaster. While the likelihood of personal harm arising from air travel is indeed <b>very</b> <b>low,</b> the consequences or an airline disaster however are very serious indeed (high consequence). Whereas, car travellers who have been involved in a traffic accident often walk away with minor injuries, the same cannot be said for airline travellers. It is the severity of the consequence rather than the uncertainty that plays into airline passengers' fears. Consumers are constantly weighing up uncertainty and consequences to reach subjective evaluations of the overall risk attached to various purchase decisions.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} {{correlation}} was {{drawn by the}} Sigma Two Group in 2003. They have studied the correlation between countries' cultural dimensions and their predominant religion based on the World Factbook 2002. On average predominantly Catholic countries show very high uncertainty avoidance, relatively high power distance, moderate masculinity and relatively low individualism, whereas predominantly atheist countries have <b>low</b> <b>uncertainty</b> avoidance, <b>very</b> high power distance, moderate masculinity, and <b>very</b> <b>low</b> individualism. Coelho (2011) found inverse correlations between rates of specific kinds of innovation in manufacturing companies {{and the percentage of}} large companies per country as well as the employment of a specific kind of manufacturing strategy. The national culture measure of power distance is positively correlated with the ratio of companies with process innovation only over the companies with any of the three types of innovation considered in the country (determinant of correlation: 28%). Hence in countries with higher power distance, innovative manufacturing companies are somewhat more bound to resort to process innovations.|$|R

40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{assessed}} {{the risk to}} plant health of Strawberry crinkle virus (SCV) for the European Union (EU) territory, and evaluated the current EU legislation and possible risk reduction options. This virus is widely distributed {{both within and outside}} Europe and the same applies to its main vector, the strawberry aphid, Chaetosiphon fragaefolii. At-risk hosts (Fragaria spp.) occur widely in Europe. Plants for planting were identified as the most significant entry pathway and the probability of entry is rated as unlikely to moderately likely with high uncertainty. The probability of establishment is rated as <b>very</b> likely with <b>low</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> The probability of local spread by natural means is moderately likely, with high uncertainty, whereas that of human-assisted long-distance spread is unlikely, with medium uncertainty. The potential consequences are rated as minimal to minor with medium uncertainty. Prohibition and restricting import or intra-EU trade to certified materials or to materials originating from pest-free areas or pest-free places of production are the options with highest effectiveness against the risks of introduction or against the risks of further spread. Prohibition and certification are also among the options of high or very high feasibility. In addition, {{it should be noted that}} the combination of options (cultural practices, certification, exclusion conditions, tolerant varieties) has an overall high to very high level of effectiveness and feasibility. The current legislation has few weaknesses: the reliance on visual inspection, as well as the exceptions or derogations offered to some countries in which SCV is present. If the current legislation were removed, no major consequences would be expected unless the industry simultaneously ceased its widely adopted certification activity, which seems unlikely given the potential consequence...|$|R
