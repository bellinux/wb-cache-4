40|$|International audienceReal time {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) thermometry {{has evolved into}} the method of choice for the guidance of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) interventions. For this role, MR-thermometry should preferably have a high temporal and spatial resolution and allow observing the temperature over the entire targeted area and its vicinity with a high accuracy. In addition, the precision of real time MR-thermometry for therapy guidance is generally limited by the available Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) {{and the influence of}} physiological noise. MR-guided HIFU would benefit of the large <b>coverage</b> <b>volumetric</b> temperature maps, including characterization of volumetric heating trajectories as well as near-and far-field heating. In this paper, continuous volumetric MR-temperature monitoring was obtained as follows: The targeted area was continuously scanned during the heating process by a multi-slice sequence. Measured data and a priori knowledge of 3 D data derived from a forecast based on a physical model were combined using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The proposed reconstruction improved the temperature measurement resolution and precision while maintaining guaranteed output accuracy. The method was evaluated experimentally ex-vivo on a phantom, and in-vivo on a porcine kidney, using HIFU heating. On the in-vivo experiment, it allowed the reconstruction from a spatio-temporally under-sampled data set (with an update rate for each voxel of 1. 143 s) to a 3 D dataset covering a field of view of 142. 5 × 285 × 54 mm 3 with a voxel size of 3 × 3 × 6 mm 3 and a temporal resolution of 0. 127 s.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is a medical}} imaging technique which can provide fine tissue contrast with relatively high image resolution in human. Besides the image quality, imaging speed is the other major concern in modern MRI, especially in human experiments where sufficient <b>volumetric</b> <b>coverage</b> is necessary. One approach to increase imaging speed is increasing image acquisition speed so that {{the same amount of}} <b>volumetric</b> <b>coverage</b> can be achieved within shorter time under conventional experiment paradigms. In this dissertation, the application of pseudo-random amplitude modulation (PRAM) in MRI was explored to increase imaging speed by designing more efficient experiment paradigms for the human brain.

The RLXAM modulation code can be chosen from a large family of binary sequences. PRAM is a specific implementation using the maximum length sequence, also known as pseudo-random sequence. The other study was measuring transit time distribution in arterial spin labeling. The application of PRAM in transit time measurement was reported before on a 3 T Philips Acheiva scanner using a single-slice protocol with standard gradient echo acquisition. The original theory was extended and multi-slice sequences with two different acquisition strategies were developed on a 3 T Siemens Trio scanner.

A multiaxial CT acquisition is achieved by combining multiple sequential 3 rd generation axial scans or by performing a single axial multisource CT scan with multiple longitudinally offset sources. Data from multiple axial scans or multiple sources provide complementary information. For full-scan acquisitions, we present a window-based 3 D analytic cone-beam reconstruction algorithm by tessellating data from neighboring axial datasets. We also show that multi-axial CT acquisition can extend the axial scan coverage while minimizing cone-beam artifacts. For half-scan acquisitions, one cannot take advantage of conjugate rays.

Although dual-inversion recovery is currently the gold standard, optimal lumen-to-vessel wall contrast is sometimes difficult to obtain, and the time window available for imaging is limited due to competing requirements between blood signal nulling time and period of minimal myocardial motion. Further, atherosclerosis is a spatially heterogeneous disease, and imaging at multiple anatomic levels of the coronary circulation is mandatory. However, this requirement of enhanced <b>volumetric</b> <b>coverage</b> comes at the expense of scanning time.

Due to the small dimensions and tortuous nature of the coronary arteries, a high spatial resolution and sufficient <b>volumetric</b> <b>coverage</b> have to be obtained.

The magnetostrictive transducer technique has several advantages for practical applications, such as a 100 percent <b>volumetric</b> <b>coverage</b> of a long segment of a structure, a reduced inspection time and its cost effectiveness, as well as relatively simple structure. Recently it has been found that the magnetostrictive properties of Fe-Co-V alloy showed superior to the conventional Ni strip. The guided wave signal amplitudes by the Fe-Co-V alloy strip are much higher than those of the Ni strip. However, the alternating excitation should be kept as low as possible to avoid unwanted vibration modes. In this paper, the effect of an alternating excitation on the DC bias magnetization of the Fe-Co-V alloy strip was investigated. In order to apply a DC magnetization along the circumference of a small bore tube, an automotive battery is used to bring the Ni strip to a saturated magnetization. In addition, an in-bore torsional guided wave probe was applied to an inspection of a heat exchanger tube. The signal quality was not good enough to compare the case of DC magnetization along the circumference by using a high power DC supply. However, it has a good advantage in that the in-bore guided wave probe can be accessed from the inside of the tube and it can be used for screening purposes such as a heat exchanger inspection. 1...|$|E

Computer models of complex physical systems can be used to expedite the design of control systems and reduce the number of physical tests. Model valida- tion tries to answer the question if the model is a good enough representation of the physical system.

The work is focused on a simulation model of the Primary Environmental Control System of Gripen E, but can be applied on validation results from other {{simulation models}}. The result from the thesis can be divided into three major components, static validation, dynamic validation and model coverage. To present the results from the static validation different multi-dimensional visualization techniques are in- vestigated and evaluated.

Two methods for validation of the dynamic performance of the model are examined. The first method uses the singular values of an error model estimated from the residual. We show that the singular values of the error model relay important information about the model’s quality but interpreting the result is a considerable challenge. The second method aims to automate a visual inspection procedure where interesting quantities are automatically computed.

Methods: Nineteen patients (mean age 13 +/- 9 years, range 1 - 25 years) with TGA after ASO who underwent 2 D PC CMR and 4 D flow CMR were included in this study. Peak velocities were measured with 4 D flow CMR in the aorta and pulmonary arteries and compared to peak velocities measured with 2 D PC CMR and Doppler echo. 2 D PC CMR data were available in the ascending aorta, main, right and left pulmonary arteries (AAO/MPA/RPA/LPA) for 19 / 18 / 17 / 17 scans, respectively, and Doppler echo data were available for 13 / 9 / 6 / 6 scans, respectively. Peak velocities were measured with: 1) a single cross section for 2 D PC CMR, 2) velocity maximum intensity projections (MIPs) for 4 D flow CMR and 3) Doppler echo. Results: Significantly higher peak velocities were found with 4 D flow CMR than 2 D PC CMR in the AAO (p = 0. 003), MPA (p = 0. 002) and RPA (p = 0. 005) but not in the LPA (p = 0. 200). No difference in peak velocity was found between 4 D flow CMR and Doppler echo (p > 0. 46) or 2 D PC CMR and echo (p > 0. 11) for all analyzed vessel segments. Conclusions: 4 D flow CMR evaluation of patients with TGA after ASO detected higher peak velocities than 2 D PC CMR, indicating the potential of 4 D flow CMR to provide improved stenosis assessment in these patients...|$|E
40|$|High-intensity focused {{ultrasound}} (HIFU) is {{an efficient}} noninvasive therapeutic technique for localized heating of tissues {{deep within the}} human body through intact skin. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide excellent soft-tissue contrast {{and can be used}} for both treatment planning and post-treatment assessment of the induced tissue damage. MRI can also provide temperature sensitive in vivo images via proton resonance frequency shift thermometry. Combined, the use of MRI and HIFU (MR-HIFU) ablation make for a promising therapeutic modality for controlled and noninvasive selective tissue destruction. Sonication strategies, MR thermometry methods, feedback control, and motion compensation for MR-HIFU were developed and evaluated in this thesis. The primary aim of the thesis was to develop a safe and efficient strategy for clinical MR-HIFU ablation. An efficient volumetric method of ablation was achieved by utilizing the phased-array capabilities of the transducer and the inherent heat diffusion of already deposited heat. The induced temperature rise was monitored with rapid multiplane MR thermometry with a <b>volumetric</b> <b>coverage</b> of the heated region. Acquisition and display of temperature images during sonication improved the safety of the therapy. The therapeutic procedure was evaluated in a large animal model and proved to provide a substantial improvement in efficiency as compared to existing methods without compromising safety. The second aim was to improve the reliability of the proposed volumetric sonication strategy. This was achieved with a simple and robust binary feedback algorithm that adjusted the sonication duration of each part of the sonication trajectory based on the temperature rise as obtained by volumetric MR thermometry. The feedback algorithm was evaluated in a large animal model, and was found to reduce the variability in thermal lesion size by approximately 70 %. The third aim was to develop a through-plane motion correction method for real-time MR thermometry without disturbing thermometry. This was achieved with a fat-selective navigator. This navigator outperformed the conventional navigator for direct tracking of the kidney under free breathing. The navigator also provided accurate indexing of the look-up-table used to correct the reference phase for MR thermometry of mobile organs. Finally, the combination of through-plane motion correction provided by the fat-selective navigator with existing methods of in-plane motion correction and reference phase correction, allowed for an accurate 3 D motion compensation of both MR thermometry and MR-HIFU sonication...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of hybrid MRI-linac (MRL) systems will drive {{a paradigm shift}} in radiotherapy. For {{the first time in}} history we have the ability to visualize both the tumor and surrounding healthy tissue before and during treatment in real time. The first high-field MRL, which was developed within the department of radiotherapy at the UMC Utrecht, in cooperation with Philips and Elekta, successfully treated the first patients in May 2017 at the UMC Utrecht. MR-guided radiotherapy has the potential to boost successful treatment outcomes by decreasing uncertainties in tumor detection, location, and shape through unprecedented soft-tissue contrast. For abdominal tumors this could induce more conformal dose distributions using precies pre-treatment imaging, real-time image feedback, and accurate dose calculations in a large field-of-view. To maximize this potential, accurate MR image guidance in all stages of treatment is essential. A general challenge for these tumors is physiological-induced motion, such as respiration. This thesis described various acquisitions, reconstruction and post-processing methods for managing this motion in pre-treatment, pre-beam, beam-on and post-beam phase of an MR-guided abdominal radiotherapy treatment. First, a method is described for pre-treatment and pre-beam 4 D-MRI motion characterization, based on a volumetric radial stack-of-stars (SOS) acquisition. It is shown that this sampling, in combination with an internal surrogate, is a robust method to generate phase-resolved 4 D-MRIs. Second, the radial SOS sampling is used as a motion compensation method in the presence of bulk motion for robust free-breathing abdominal imaging. Using the free-induction decay signal, bulk motion is automatically detected and excluded in real time. It is shown that this increases image quality, reduces artifacts and results in an overall increase in acquisition robustness. Third, a motion model is introduced to generate volumetric MRI with high spatio-temporal resolution, so-called volumetric cine-MRI. Using the aforementioned 4 D-MRI acquisition, a motion model is generated by parameterizing the underlying motion. Subsequently, 3 D volumes are generated by filling in the missing volumetric information of fast 2 D beam-on cine-MR images using the model. Fourth, these volumetric cine-MRIs are used to calculate the accumulated dose of abdominal treatments. It is shown that precise imaging with sufficient temporal resolution is required for accurate dose tracking in abdominal tumors and both fast and slow variations in breathing should be taken into account. Last, a mathematical framework is outlined to optimize acceleration parameters of simultaneous multi-slice acquisitions that can accelerate pre-treatment and pre-beam imaging, or increase <b>volumetric</b> <b>coverage</b> of beam-on imaging. By optimizing these acceleration parameters, higher acceleration can be accomplished, while maintaining similar signal-to-noise ratios. The presented methods can directly add valuable information for all stages of an MR-guided abdominal radiotherapy treatment. Ultimately, these methods can aid real-time image guidance and online plan adaptation to improve treatment outcomes...|$|E
