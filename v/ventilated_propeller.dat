50|$|An {{alternative}} to the supercavitating propeller is the surface piercing, or <b>ventilated</b> <b>propeller.</b> These propellers are designed to intentionally cleave the water and entrain atmospheric air to fill the void, {{which means that the}} resulting gas layer on the forward face of the propeller blade consists of air instead of water vapour. Less energy is thus used, and the surface-piercing propeller generally enjoys lower drag than the supercavitating principle. The surface-piercing propeller also has wedge-shaped blades, and propellers may be designed that can operate in both supercavitating and surface-piercing mode.|$|E
40|$|A {{partially}} submerged propeller {{theory was}} developed by employing a singularity distribution method. Unsteady pressure doublets and pressure sources represented the blade camber and blade-and-cavity thickness respectively. The induced velocities were derived by reducing the formula to a lifting-line configuration. The free-surface effect was considered by use of the image method. The induced velocities contained the singular integrals of 5 th order, which are usually numerical unstable. An {{effort was made to}} derive numerically stable formulae from these singular equations by applying a method similar to the induction-factor method of Morgan & Wrench (1965) and Lerbs (1952) used for steady-state fully wetted propeller problems. These new formulae are not only applicable to the present partially submerged <b>ventilated</b> <b>propeller</b> problem, but also to general unsteady subcavitating and cavitating propeller problems such as propeller starting-up and non-periodic loading problems. By combining the two-dimensional water entry-and-exit theory of Wang (1979), the thrust and torque coefficients were calculated for representative partially submerged propellers and favourably compared with the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The {{simulation}} model PropSiM for simulation of propeller performance {{has been developed}} and implemented into Simulink. The {{simulation model}} generates a time domain solution to the six degree of freedom propeller forces in varying operation conditions, including: Change of operating point, including controllable pitch. Unsteady axial and tangential inflow wake field. Effect of oblique inflow in manoeuvring conditions. Reduced propeller submergence. Wagner effect. Propeller ventilation. The basic hydrodynamic propeller calculations are performed using propeller vortex lattice lifting line theory. The control and vortex points are cosine spaced along the lifting line, providing efficient convergence even for {{a limited number of}} vortex panels. Solution to the unsteady inflow wake field is found using a quasi-steady approach, where calculations from all the respective blade positions are superimposed to get a representation of the unsteady wake field. This approach has been verified using simulations with the software AKPA. The effect of oblique inflow is found by adapting the inflow wake field to the inflow an- gle and perform a skewed propeller wake correction. The effect of partly submergence is treated by forcing the circulation to be zero at the dry parts of the blade. In addition the Wagner effect is included. Ventilation is considered using an analogy to a blade experiencing only static pressure on the pressure side and atmospheric pressure on the suction side, and adding a weight factor for the amount of <b>ventilated</b> <b>propeller</b> disk area. Comparison of open water test of the model scale KVLCC 2 propeller, AKPA and PropSiM calculations shows that the predicted thrust and torque values generally are conservative. Yet the development with varying advance number J agrees well with the experiments. In addition the ability to reproduce an accurate spanwise circulation and lift distribution has been validated against akpa calculations. In general PropSiM overestimates the lift, but multiple runs indicate that the lift and circulation distribution are reproduced sufficiently {{for a wide range of}} operating points. The simulation model has been validated against experimental results for four different cases of varying propeller submergence and ventilation mechanisms. The first case is a non-ventilating condition of a propeller being forced in sinusoidal heave motion. The other three cases are all ventilating conditions, while the last two cases are in addition surface piercing conditions. The results show that PropSiM has the ability to catch the effects of abrupt changes in operating conditions in a very convincing way. The model is also validated for oblique inflow calculations against model experiments. The results show that thrust and torque are sufficiently predicted by the simulation model. The vertical side force and bending moment is not as well predicted as the horisontal side force and bending moment. However the total side force and bending moment coefficients are predicted with similar behaviour as found in experiments for increasing advance number and azimuth angles...|$|E
40|$|Ships {{and marine}} {{structures}} operating with propellers will {{from time to}} time experience severe, instantaneous thrust and torque losses to air drawing to the propeller. This is known as ventilation, and it may cause serious issues for vessels operating at rough seas. Not only will ventilation lead loss of propulsive power, the dynamic and fluctuating nature of the phenomenon may cause propeller racing, leading to damages to the mechanical parts of the engine. There has been a large amount of research on <b>ventilating</b> <b>propellers</b> over the last few years. But there is still a need for a simple mathematical model of the forces at stake during ventilation. As part of this thesis effort has been made towards creating a mathematical model able to capture the important physical aspects of propellers during ventilation. The basis for is a complete momentum theory, able to capture both axially and tangentially induced velocities. Comparing the mathematical propeller model against experimental results, as well as against more established programs such as OpenProp has shown that the numerical method is not of very high accuracy. Testing propeller geometry against experimental results did in fact yield quite large errors. On other occasions the resulting forces calculated by the numerical model coincide fairly well with other solutions. Even though the final numerical model is quite simple, and prone to inaccuracies it is still able to capture some of the important aspects of <b>ventilating</b> <b>propellers.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a thesis}} about control of marine propellers. All ships and {{underwater}} vehicles, {{as well as}} an increasing number of offshore exploration and exploitation vessels, are controlled by proper action of their propulsion systems. For safe and cost effective operations, high performance vessel control systems are needed. To achieve this, all parts of the vessel control system, including both plant level and low-level control, must be addressed. However, limited attention has earlier been given to the effects of the propulsion system dynamics. The possible consequences of improper thruster control are: • Decreased closed-loop vessel performance due to inaccurate thrust production • Increased vessel down-time and maintenance cost due to unnecessary mechanical wear and tear. • Increased fuel consumption and risk of blackouts due to unpredictable power consumption. By focusing explicitly on the propeller operating conditions and the available options for low-level thruster control, this thesis presents several results to remedy these problems. Two operational regimes are defined: normal, and extreme conditions. In normal operating conditions, the dynamic loading of the propellers is considered to be moderate, and primarily caused by oscillations in the inflow. In extreme conditions, the additional dynamic loads due to ventilation and in-and-out-ofwater effects can be severe. In order to improve the understanding of these loads and develop a simulation model suitable for control system design and testing, systematic model tests with a <b>ventilating</b> <b>propeller</b> in a cavitation tunnel and a towing tank have been undertaken. In conventional propulsion systems with fixed-pitch propellers, the low level thruster controllers are usually aimed at controlling the shaft speed. Other control options are torque control and power control, as well as combinations of the three. The main scientific contributions of this thesis are: • A combined torque/power controller and a combined speed/torque/power controller are designed. When compared to conventional shaft speed control, the proposed controllers give improved thrust production, decreased wear and tear, and reduced power oscillations. • A propeller load torque observer and a torque loss estimation scheme is developed, enabling on-line monitoring of the propeller performance. • An anti-spin thruster controller that enables use of torque and power control also in extreme operating conditions is motivated and designed. By applying the load torque observer to detect ventilation incidents, the antispin controller takes control of the shaft speed and lowers it until the ventilation incident is terminated. • A propeller performance measure {{that can be used to}} improve thrust allocation in extreme operating conditions is introduced. The proposed controllers and estimation schemes are validated through theoretical analyses, numerical simulations, and experiments on a model-scale propeller. </p...|$|R
