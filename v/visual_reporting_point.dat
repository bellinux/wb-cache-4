[...] Jordan Marsh stood at the southern end as the sole anchor. [...] It was the first mall-styled Jordan Marsh in the country and was unmistakable for its large white dome. The dome was visible from the air and was used on aeronautical charts as a <b>visual</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>point</b> for aircraft approaching Boston's Logan Airport. [...] It was reputed to be the third largest (in diameter) unsupported dome in the world after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and St. Paul's Cathedral in London. [...] The Shopper's World store quickly became the most recognizable Jordan Marsh outside the flagship store in Boston.|$|E

50|$|The huge towers were a local landmark, {{and served}} as a <b>visual</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>point</b> for {{aircraft}} landing at the nearby Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) airport. A golf course ran through the VLF antenna farm; special rules addressed hitting a tower with a ball (usually stroke and distance). The NSS HF receiver station, and the headquarters for NavCommStaWashingtonDC(T), was located at the Naval Communications Station in Cheltenham, Maryland until 1969. In late 1969, the receiver station at Cheltenham closed and a new receiver station was activated at Sugar Grove, West Virginia.|$|E
50|$|The {{final stage}} is to note which areas the route will pass through or over, {{and to make}} a note of all of the things to be done - which ATC units to contact, the {{appropriate}} frequencies, <b>visual</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>points,</b> and so on. It is also important to note which pressure setting regions will be entered, so that the pilot can ask for the QNH (air pressure) of those regions. Finally, the pilot should have in mind some alternative plans in case the route cannot be flown for some reason - unexpected weather conditions being the most common. At times the pilot may be required to file a flight plan for an alternate destination and to carry adequate fuel for this. The more work a pilot can do on the ground prior to departure, the easier it will be in the air.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} article, we develop {{arguments}} {{to show that}} audio visual data encourages varying levels of engagement (from micro to macro levels) of varying actors in the research process. First, gathering of visual material allows participants to play a more active part in the self-collection of data about themselves. Secondly, the process of data analysis can also involve participants by encouraging them to share their insights and further develop them to a deeper level of analysis. Hence {{at the level of}} data collection and analysis, visual research methods foster participants’ engagement in the inquiry process. Engagement is present again at the third level of data <b>reporting,</b> with <b>visual</b> <b>reporting</b> fostering this time the potential for stakeholders’ engagement with <b>visual</b> <b>reporting</b> disseminated via the Internet or screened in the community...|$|R
