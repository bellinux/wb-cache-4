25|$|A {{phase locked}} loop is a {{feedback}} control system. It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an error signal that {{is proportional to the}} difference between their phases. The error signal is then low pass filtered and used to drive a <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>oscillator</b> (VCO) which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a frequency divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output frequency drifts, the phase error signal will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency. The block diagram below shows the basic elements and arrangement of a PLL based frequency synthesizer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Based on a {{physical}} understanding of phase-noise mechanisms, a passive LC filter {{is found to}} lower the phase-noise factor in a differential oscillator to its fundamental minimum. Three fully integrated LC <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>oscillators</b> (VCOs) serve as a proof of concept. Two 1. 1 -GHz VCOs achieve 153 dBc/Hz at 3 MHz offset, biased at 3. 7 mA from 2. 5 V. A 2. 1 -GHz VCO achieves 148 dBc/Hz at 15 MHz offset, taking 4 mA from a 2. 7 -V supply. All oscillators use fully integrated resonators, and the first two exceed discrete transistor modules in figure of merit. Practical aspects and repercussions of the technique are discussed.
