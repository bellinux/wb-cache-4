From robotic <b>vacuums,</b> <b>bomb</b> retrievers, exoskeletons and drones, to robots used in surgery, space exploration, agriculture, home assistance and construction, service robots are building a formidable resume. In just the last few years we have seen service robots deliver room service meals, assist shoppers in finding items in a large home improvement store, checking in customers and storing their luggage at hotels, and pour drinks on cruise ships. Personal robots are here to educate, assist and entertain at home. These domestic robots can perform daily chores, assist people with disabilities and serve as companions or pets for entertainment. By all accounts, the growth potential for service robotics is quite large. Comment: A Computing Community Consortium (CCC) white paper, 7 page...|$|R

50|$|Thermos {{bomb was}} the {{informal}} {{name for the}} AR-4, an air dropped anti-personnel mine used by the Italian Air Force during World War II. Large numbers were used against Malta and in the Middle East. It was named for its superficial appearance to a Thermos bottle, a popular brand of <b>vacuum</b> flask. The <b>bomb</b> was a cylinder 31 centimetres long and weighing 3.68 kilograms. It could be fitted with a very sensitive motion-sensitive fuze that would detonate if any {{attempt was made to}} move it, and could be lethal in the open up to around 35 metres away. Because of this, unexploded Thermos bombs were normally destroyed where they fell, generally by attaching a long piece of string to them and giving it a jerk, or detonating a small explosive charge next to them.|$|R

40|$|The system {{built to}} {{characterize}} electrodes and, consequently, deposited fine films are constituted by a hollow cathode {{that works to}} discharges and low pressures (approximately 10 - 3 to 5 mbar), a source DC (0 to 1200 V), a cylindrical camera of closed borossilicato for flanges of stainless steel with an association of <b>vacuum</b> <b>bombs</b> mechanical and spread. In the upper flange it is connected the system of hollow cathode, which possesses an entrance of gas and two entrances for its refrigeration, the same is electrically isolated {{of the rest of}} the equipment and it is polarized negatively. In front of the system of hollow cathode there is a movable sample in stainless steel with possibility of moving in the horizontal and vertical. In the vertical, the sample can vary its distance between 0 and 70 mm and, in the horizontal, can leave completely from the front of the hollow cathode. The sample and also the cathode hollow are equipped with cromel-alumel termopares with simultaneous reading of the temperatures during the time of treatment. In this work copper electrodes, bronze, titanium, iron, stainless steel, powder of titanium, powder of titanium and silício, glass and ceramic were used. The electrodes were investigated relating their geometry change and behavior of the plasma of the cavity of hollow cathode and channel of the gas. As the cavity of hollow cathode, the analyzed aspects were the diameter and depth. With the channel of the gas, we verified the diameter. In the two situations, we investigated parameters as flow of the gas, pressure, current and applied tension in the electrode, temperature, loss of mass of the electrode with relationship at the time of use. The flow of gas investigated in the electrodes it was fastened in a work strip from 15 to 6 sccm, the constant pressure of work was among 2. 7 to 8 x 10 - 2 mbar. The applied current was among a strip of work from 0, 8 to 0, 4 A, and their respective tensions were in a strip from 400 to 220 V. Fixing the value of the current, it was possible to lift the curve of the behavior of the tension with the time of use. That curves esteem in that time of use of the electrode to its efficiency is maximum. The temperatures of the electrodes were in the dependence of that curves showing a maximum temperature when the tension was maximum, yet the measured temperatures in the samples showed to be sensitive the variation of the temperature in the electrodes. An accompaniment of the loss of mass of the electrode relating to its time of use showed that the electrodes that appeared the spherical cavities lost more mass in comparison with the electrodes in that didn't appear. That phenomenon is only seen for pressures of 10 - 2 mbar, in these conditions a plasma column is formed inside of the channel of the gas and in certain points it is concentrated in form of spheres. Those spherical cavities develop inside of the channel of the gas spreading during the whole extension of the channel of the gas. The used electrodes were cut after they could not be more used, however among those electrodes, films that were deposited in alternate times and the electrodes that were used to deposit films in same times, those films were deposited in the glass substrata, alumina, stainless steel 420, stainless steel 316, silício and steel M 2. As the eletros used to deposit films in alternate time as the ones that they were used to deposit in same times, the behavior of the thickness of the film obeyed the curve of the tension with relationship the time of use of the electrode, that is, when the tension was maximum, the thickness of the film was also maximum and when the tension was minimum, the thickness was minimum and in the case where the value of the tension was constant, the thickness of the film tends to be constant. The fine films that were produced they had applications with nano stick, bio-compatibility, cellular growth, inhibition of bacterias, cut tool, metallic leagues, brasagem, pineapple fiber and ornamental. In those films it was investigated the thickness, the adherence and the uniformity characterized by sweeping electronic microscopy. Another technique developed to assist the production and characterization of the films produced in that work was the caloteste. It uses a sphere and abrasive to mark the sample with a cap impression, with that cap form it is possible to calculate the thickness of the film. Through the time of life of the cathode, it was possible to evaluate the rate of waste of its material for the different work conditions. Values of waste rate up to 3, 2 x 10 - 6 g/s were verified. For a distance of the substratum of 11 mm, the deposited film was limited to a circular area of 22 mm diameter mm for high pressures and a circular area of 75 mm for pressure strip. The obtained films presented thickness around 2, 1 µm, showing that the discharge of arch of hollow cathode in argon obeys a curve characteristic of the tension with the time of life of the eletrodo. The deposition rate obtained in this system it is of approximately 0, 18 µm/minCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível SuperiorO sistema construído para caracterizar eletrodos e, conseqüentemente, filmes finos depositados é constituído por um cátodo oco que trabalha a altas e baixas pressões (aproximadamente 10 - 3 a 5 mbar), uma fonte DC (0 a 1200 V), uma câmara cilíndrica de borossilicato fechada por flanges de aço inox com uma associação de bombas de vácuo mecânica e difusora. No flange superior está conectado o sistema de cátodo oco, o qual possui uma entrada de gás e duas entradas para a sua refrigeração, o mesmo está eletricamente isolado do resto do equipamento e é polarizado negativamente. Em frente ao sistema de cátodo oco encontra-se um porta amostra em aço inox móvel com possibilidade de se mover na horizontal e vertical. Na vertical, o porta amostra pode variar a sua distância entre 0 e 70 mm e, na horizontal, pode sair completamente da frente do cátodo oco. Tanto o porta amostra como o cátodo oco são equipados com termopares de cromel-alumel com leitura simultânea das temperaturas durante o tempo de tratamento. Neste trabalho foram utilizados eletrodos de cobre, bronze, titânio, ferro, aço inox, pó de titânio, pó de titânio e silício, vidro e cerâmica. Os eletrodos foram investigados com relação a sua mudança de geometria e comportamento do plasma dentro da cavidade de cátodo oco e canal do gás. Quanto a cavidade de cátodo oco, os aspectos analisados foram o diâmetro e sua profundidade. Com o canal do gás, verificamos o diâmetro. Nas duas situações, investigamos parâmetros como fluxo do gás, pressão, corrente e tensão aplicada no eletrodo, temperatura, perda de massa do eletrodo com relação ao tempo de uso. O fluxo de gás investigado nos eletrodos foi fixado em uma faixa de trabalho de 15 a 6 sccm, a pressão constante de trabalho ficou entre 2. 7 a 8 x 10 - 2 mbar. A corrente aplicada foi entre uma faixa de trabalho de 0, 8 a 0, 4 A, e as suas respectivas tensões ficaram em uma faixa de 400 a 220 V. Fixando o valor da corrente, foi possível levantar a curva do comportamento da tensão com o tempo de uso. Essa curva estima em que tempo de uso do eletrodo a sua eficiência é máxima. As temperaturas dos eletrodos ficaram na dependência dessa curva mostrando uma temperatura máxima quando a tensão era máxima, já as temperaturas medidas nas amostras mostraram ser sensíveis a variação da temperatura no eletrodo. Um acompanhamento da perda de massa do eletrodo com relação ao seu tempo de uso mostrou que os eletrodos que apareceram as cavidades esféricas perderam mais massa em comparação aos eletrodos em que essas não apareceram. Esse fenômeno só é visto para pressões de 10 - 2 mbar, nestas condições uma coluna de plasma se forma dentro do canal do gás e em determinados pontos fica concentrado em forma de esferas. Essas cavidades esféricas evoluem dentro do canal do gás se propagando durante toda a extensão do canal do gás. Os eletros utilizados foram cortados depois que não puderam ser mais usados, no entanto entre esses eletrodos filmes que foram depositados em tempos alternados e os eletrodos que foram utilizados para depositar filmes em tempos iguais, esses filmes foram depositados nos substratos de vidro, alumina, aço inox 420, aço inox 316, silício e aço M 2. Tanto os eletros usados para depositar filmes em tempo alternado como os que foram usados para depositar em tempos iguais, o comportamento da espessura do filme obedeceu a curva da tensão com relação ao tempo de uso do eletrodo, isto é, quando a tensão era máxima, a espessura do filme também foi máxima e quando a tensão era mínima, a espessura foi mínima e no caso onde o valor da tensão foi constante, a espessura do filme tende a ficar constante. Os filmes finos que foram produzidos tiveram aplicações com nano bastão, bio-compatibilidade, crescimento celular, inibição de bactérias, ferramenta de corte, ligas metálicas, brasagem, fibra de abacaxi e decorativos. Nesses filmes foi investigada a espessura, a aderência e a uniformidade caracterizadas por microscopia eletrônica de varredura. Outra técnica desenvolvida para atender a produção e caracterização dos filmes produzidos nesse trabalho foi o caloteste. Ele se utiliza de uma esfera e abrasivo para marcar a amostra com uma impressão de calota, com essa forma de calota é possível calcular a espessura do filme. Através do tempo de vida do cátodo, foi possível avaliar a taxa de desgaste do seu material para as diferentes condições de trabalho. Valores de taxa de desgaste até 3, 2 x 10 - 6 g/s foram verificados. Para uma distância do substrato de 11 mm, o filme depositado ficou limitado a uma área circular de 22 mm de diâmetro para pressões altas e uma área circular de 75 mm para faixa de pressão. Os filmes obtidos apresentaram espessura em torno de 2, 1 µm, mostrando que a descarga de arco de cátodo oco em argônio obedece a uma curva característica da tensão com o tempo de vida do eletrodo. A taxa de deposição obtida neste sistema é de aproximadamente 0, 18 µm/mi...|$|R
