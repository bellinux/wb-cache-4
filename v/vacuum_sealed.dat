25|$|To {{increase}} the {{mean free path}} of the electron gas interaction, a standard TEM is evacuated to low pressures, typically {{on the order of}} 10−4 Pa. The need for this is twofold: first the allowance for the voltage difference between the cathode and the ground without generating an arc, and secondly to reduce the collision frequency of electrons with gas atoms to negligible levels—this effect is characterized by the mean free path. TEM components such as specimen holders and film cartridges must be routinely inserted or replaced requiring a system with the ability to re-evacuate on a regular basis. As such, TEMs are equipped with multiple pumping systems and airlocks and are not permanently <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the food}} aboard is <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealed</b> in plastic bags. Cans are rare because they are heavy and {{expensive}} to transport. Preserved food is not highly regarded by the crew, and taste is reduced in microgravity. Therefore, effort is made to make the food more palatable, such as using more spices than in regular cooking. The crew looks forward {{to the arrival of}} any ships from Earth, as they bring fresh fruit and vegetables. Care is taken that foods do not create crumbs. Sauces are often used to avoid contaminating station equipment. Each crew member has individual food packages and cooks them using the on-board galley. The galley features two food warmers, a refrigerator added in November 2008, and a water dispenser that provides both heated and unheated water. Drinks are provided as dehydrated powder that is mixed with water before consumption. Drinks and soups are sipped from plastic bags with straws. Solid food is eaten with a knife and fork attached to a tray with magnets to prevent them from floating away. Any food that floats away, including crumbs, must be collected to prevent it from clogging the station's air filters and other equipment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealing</b> drainage in the patients with osteofascial compart-ment syndrome in comparison to conventional treatment. Methods: Fifty-two patients diagnosed with osteofascial compartment syndrome were enrolled in this study. They were randomly {{divided into two groups}} based on treat-ments: <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealing</b> drainage and conventional treatment. After operation, the length of hospital stay and anti-biotics administration were recorded in the two groups, as well as swelling elimination and wound closure. Results: No significant difference was observed in terms of the baseline characteristics between the two groups. There are no obvious local or systemic complications in all cases. In contrast to conventional treatment group, the time of swelling elimination, wound closure, hospital stay and antibiotics application were reduced significantly in <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealing</b> drainage group. No allergic reactions or other side effects were observed after the application of <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealing</b> drainage material, indicating its safety.

40|$|Rapid and {{reliable}} assessment of volatile and semivolatile organic compounds {{in the environment}} using gas chromatography �GC � is often limited by cost of analysis, and time delays between sampling and analysis. Many environmental monitors incorporating GC systems are too large for portability, and lack sufficient sensitivity and/or selectivity to serve as practical environmental monitors. Frequently, a complete system redesign, due to nonlinear power scaling relative to component size, is required to reduce the mass and volume of power supplies, especially for the micro-systems of present interest. Here, we examined four strategies in reducing power demand by the largest consumer of power in a model micro GC, the preconcentrator. Our simulations included alterations in heater pad placement/size, reduction of thermal mass in the device, <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealing,</b> and incorporation of a gas dwell time during preconcentrator heating.
