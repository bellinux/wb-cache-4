25|$|Over {{the first}} seven series the show's viewing figures have {{generally}} trended up each series, however {{this was not the}} case for series 3.

25|$|In the UK the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB) has {{included}} RT in the viewer data it publishes since 2012. According to their data approximately 2.5 million Britons watched RT {{during the third}} quarter of 2012, making it the third most-watched rolling news channel in Britain, behind BBC News and Sky News (not including Sky Sports News). However RT was soon overtaken by Al Jazeera English, and viewing figures had dropped to about 2.1 million by the end of 2013. For comparison it has marginally fewer viewers than S4C, the state-funded Welsh language broadcaster, or minor channels such as Zing, Viva and Rishtey. According to internal documents submitted for Kremlin review, RT's viewership amounts to less than 0.1 percent of Europe's television audience, except in Britain, where 2013 viewership was estimated at approximately 120,000 persons per day. According to the leaked documents, RT was ranked 175th out of 278 channels in Great Britain in May 2013, or in fifth place out of eight cable news channels. In August 2015, RT's average weekly <b>viewing</b> <b>figure</b> had fallen to around 450,000 (0.8 percent of the total UK audience), 100,000 fewer than in June 2012 and less than half that of Al Jazeera English. In March 2016 the monthly viewing was figure 0.04%.|$|E
25|$|Big Brother 8 aired episodes {{three times}} a week, with shows airing Sundays at 8 p.m. (EDT), Tuesdays 9 p.m., and Thursday 8 p.m. The first episode premiered on July 5, 2007 with 7.401 million viewers (4.8/9 viewing audience), down from last year's 5.2/9 launch. The {{following}} show on Sunday did much worse in the ratings, scoring a 3.9/7 <b>viewing</b> <b>figure,</b> losing nearly 1 million viewers since the previous episode. The first Tuesday's show, however, was more successful with viewers, managing a 4.5/7 rating. The following Tuesday's show had the same rating. Tuesday shows are typically the highest rated among the three episodes every week, with Thursday in second and Sunday, a competitive night in television, in last among all three recap shows. Sunday, August 5's episode, became {{the first edition of}} the season that rated higher than the launch show and the first of the season to receive a 5.0 in preliminary ratings points. On August 23 another record was set: the first episode with 10% of the viewing audience and the first episode to read 5.3 in rating points and 8.1 million viewers, thus becoming the highest rated episode of the season. Another record was broken August 30, being the first episode to read 6.0 in rating points, being the first episode this season to pull 11% of the viewing audience. It was also the first episode to break the 9m viewer mark, with 9.42m viewers.|$|E

25|$|Several episodes {{received}} {{extremely high}} audience figures, especially the first series. This was {{partly due to}} the fact that the main rival channel to BBC One channel in the UK, ITV, was in the middle of a long protracted strike which started in early August 1979, which saw nearly all of the local ITV companies go off air and no programmes being aired from the network (except Channel Television in the Channel Island), leaving only BBC One and BBC Two as the channels left for the British public to watch until Wednesday 24th October 1979 when ITV returned to air, with the strike ending in a pay agreement. However many viewers remained with the BBC and shows such as To The Manor Born, as ITV took some months to get going again with new programmes. For the first month after the strike had ended, ITV found it hard to win back viewers who preferred to remain with the BBC, as ITV was airing repeats and filler programmes until new content was made from November 1979. This gave To The Manor Born a huge advantage with the viewing public. In 1979, the last episode of the first series received 23.95 million viewers, the fourth-highest figures for any programme in the UK in the 1970s, and the highest for a non-live event. The following year, 21.55 million people watched the last episode of series two, the fifth-highest <b>viewing</b> <b>figure</b> for the 1980s. The final episode in 1981, when Audrey and Richard marry, received 17.80 million viewers. The 2007 Christmas special garnered 10.25 million viewers and ranked as the 6th most watched programme in the UK for that week.|$|E

The <b>viewing</b> <b>figure</b> is the highest for the new series, exceeding the previous record set by [...] "Rose". The figure is also the highest for Doctor Who overall since 1979, specifically, the final episode of [...] "City of Death". The episode's Appreciation Index rating was 86 ("excellent"), above the average score of 77 for drama programmes, and was the highest Index rating for any programme shown on terrestrial television on Christmas Day. Although not filmed in HD, the BBC aired it on BBC One HD, Wednesday 29 December 2010, having up-scaled the program to HD and also including Dolby Surround sound. This is the first Doctor Who episode, filmed in SD, to have been up-scaled to HD for broadcast on television, and the second episode, overall, to be up-scaled from SD to HD, the first being the 2008 Christmas Special, The Next Doctor, for the Blu-ray release of the Complete Specials Boxset.|$|E
