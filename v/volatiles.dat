These results suggest that female mice emit specific <b>volatile</b> odors which are not excreted into bedding, and that the <b>volatile</b> odors activate the accessory olfactory system of male mice without physical contact. To characterize the female-specific <b>volatile</b> odors, we conducted habituation-dishabituation tests.

Plants damaged by intact caterpillars released 11 <b>volatile</b> compounds. Ablated caterpillars induced these same 11 compounds plus an additional eight.

5|$|Following Voyager's {{encounters}} with Enceladus {{in the early}} 1980s, scientists postulated {{that it may be}} geologically active based on its young, reflective surface and location near the core of the Ering. Based on the connection between Enceladus and the Ering, scientists suspected that Enceladus was the source of material in the Ering, perhaps through venting of water vapor. Readings from Cassini's 2005 passage suggested that cryovolcanism, where water and other <b>volatiles</b> are the materials erupted instead of silicate rock, had been discovered on Enceladus. The first Cassini sighting of a plume of icy particles above Enceladus's south pole came from the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) images taken in January and February 2005, though the possibility of a camera artifact delayed an official announcement. Data from the magnetometer instrument during the February 17, 2005, encounter provided a hint that the feature might be real when it found evidence for a planetary atmosphere. The magnetometer observed an increase in the power of ion cyclotron waves near Enceladus. These waves are produced by the interaction of ionized particles and magnetic fields, and the waves' frequency can be used to identify their composition, in this case ionized water vapor. During the two following encounters, the magnetometer team determined that gases in Enceladus's atmosphere are concentrated over the south polar region, with atmospheric density away from the pole being much lower. The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) confirmed this result by observing two stellar occultations during the February 17 and July 14 encounters. Unlike the magnetometer, UVIS failed to detect an atmosphere above Enceladus during the February encounter when it looked over the equatorial region, but did detect water vapor during an occultation over the south polar region during the July encounter.|$|E
