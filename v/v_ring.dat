5000|$|Originally at common law, impossibility was a {{complete}} defence; [...] as it was under French law at one point. [...] Indeed, the ruling in Collins's Case L. and C. 471 was that an offender cannot be guilty {{of an attempt to}} steal his own umbrella when he mistakenly believes that it belongs to another. Although the [...] "moral guilt" [...] for the attempt and the actual crime were the same, there was a distinction between the harm caused by a theft and the harmlessness of an impossible act.

The <b>V</b> <b>ring</b> Margin {{is characterized by}} the presence of large volume of magmatic underplating, thick Mesozoic basins, and prominent crustal thinning. Results from recent deep seismic experiments in the <b>V</b> <b>ring</b> Basin and <b>V</b> <b>ring</b> Marginal High and 3 -D gravity modelling have been implemented in a regional 2 -D lithospheric transect that runs from the Norwegian Caledonian Belt to the oceanic domain, crossing the transition between the Precambrian Fennoscandian/ Baltic shield and the Cenozoic northern North Atlantic oceanic lithosphere. The modelling approach integrates elevation, gravity, geoid and heat flow data under the assumptions of thermal steady-state and local isostasy. The results confirm and refine the major trends of the crustal geometry which is characterized by a Moho depth varying from about 45 km beneath the Caledonian thrusts, to 30 km beneath the Tr ndelag Platform, to 20 ^ 14 km beneath the <b>V</b> <b>ring</b> Basin and to 13 km in the oceanic domain. The lithosphere thins from the Norwegian Caledonian Belt (190 km thick) to the oceanic domain (6 60 km) in a stepwise manner reflecting the progressive seawards migration of lithospheric deformation since the Paleozoic.

30|$|Kidney {{diseases}} {{are becoming a}} major cause of global burden with high mortality and morbidity. The origins of most kidney {{diseases are}} known, but for some the exact aetiology is not yet understood. Dermatoglyphics is the scientific study of epidermal ridge patterns and it {{has been used as a}} non-invasive diagnostic tool to detect or predict different medical conditions that have foetal origin. However, there have been a limited number of studies that have evaluated a dermatoglyphic relationship in different kidney diseases. The aim of this review was to systematically identify, review and appraise available literature that evaluated an association of different dermatoglyphic variables with kidney diseases. This review is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. The PubMed® (Medline), POPLINE, Cochrane Library and Trip Database and grey literature sources such as OpenGrey, Google Scholar, and Google were searched to earliest date to 17 April 2014. Of the 36 relevant publications, 15 were included in the review. Of these studies, there are five case reports, seven case series and three comparative studies. Possible association of dermatoglyphics with Wilms tumor (WT) had been evaluated in two comparative studies and one case series that found fewer whorls and a lower mean total ridge count (TRC). Another study evaluated adult polycystic kidney disease (APCD) type III that revealed lower TRC means in all cases. All other case series and case reports describe dermatoglyphics in various kidney disease such as acro-renal-ocular syndrome, potter syndrome, kabuki makeup syndrome, neurofaciodigitorenal syndrome, syndactyly type <b>V,</b> <b>ring</b> chromosome 13 syndrome, trisomy 13 syndrome and sirenomelia. It is evident that whorl pattern frequency and TRC have been used widely to investigate the uncertainty related to the origin of several kidney diseases such as WT and APCD type III. However, small sample sizes, possibly methodological issues, and discrepancy in the make up between cases and control groups limits interpretation of any significant findings. Future studies with proper protocol, adequate cases, and control groups may provide stronger evidence to resolve uncertainty related to the aetiology of kidney diseases.|$|E

Improving on previous results, anisotropic displacement parameters for all non-H atoms were refined and the H atom located, obtaining a significant improvement of accuracy and an unambiguous hydrogen-bonding scheme. Brackebuschite belongs to the brackebuschite group of minerals with general formula A 2 M(T 1 O 4) (T 2 O 4) (OH, H 2 O), with A = Pb 2 +, Ba, Ca, Sr; M = Cu 2 +, Zn, Fe 2 +, Fe 3 +, Mn 3 +, Al; T 1 = As 5 +, P, V 5 +; and T 2 = As 5 +, P, V 5 +, S 6 +. The {{crystal structure}} of brackebuschite {{is based on a}} cubic closest-packed array of O and Pb atoms with infinite chains of edge-sharing [Mn 3 +O 6] octahedra located about inversion centres and decorated by two unique VO 4 tetrahedra (each located on a special position 2 e, site symmetry m). One type of VO 4 tetrahedra is linked with the 1 ∞[MnO 4 / 2 O 2 / 1] chain by one common vertex, alternating with H atoms along the chain, while the other type of VO 4 tetrahedra link two adjacent octahedra by sharing two vertices with them and thereby participating in the formation of a three-membered Mn 2 <b>V</b> <b>ring</b> between the central atoms. The 1 ∞[Mn 3 +(VO 4) 2 OH] chains run parallel to [010] and are held together by two types of irregular [PbOx] polyhedra (x = 8, 11), both located on special position 2 e (site symmetry m). The magnitude of the libration component of the O atoms of the 1 ∞[Mn 3 +(VO 4) 2 OH] chain increases linearly with the distance from the centerline of the chain, indicating a significant twisting to and fro of the chain along [010]. The hydroxy group bridges one Pb 2 + cation with two Mn 3 + cations and forms an almost linear hydrogen bond with a vanadate group of a neighbouring chain. The O [...] .
