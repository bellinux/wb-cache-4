Users had to buy, in advance, a special paper licence at a cost of S$3 per day, which was sold at post offices, petrol stations, area licence sales booths or convenience stores, on a monthly or daily basis. This licence was displayed on the car windscreen or on the handle bars for motorcycles during hours of operation. Initially, they were 7.30 am to 9.30 am daily, except on Sundays and public holidays. However, it soon had to be extended to 10.15 am, to control the surge of vehicles waiting to enter just after 9.30 am.

This study investigates whether and when car drivers perform <b>visual</b> <b>checks</b> for potentially encroaching cyclists during right-turn maneuvers at urban intersections. UDrive naturalistic data from instrumented vehicles in France, the Netherlands, Poland, and Great Britain were used. The dataset consisted of 852 right-turn maneuvers (UK: left-turn, throughout this document) across 56 drivers. In the six seconds prior to the maneuver, drivers checked their blind spot in 4 % of the cases. This frequency increased to 8 % when the maneuver was included. The prevalence of cyclist facilities was highest in the Netherlands, which is also the country where blind spot checks were performed most often. When not checking the blind spot, drivers mostly looked toward the road they were turning into. Country predicted neither the timing of sideway glances, nor whether there was any (right) sideways glance. Our findings may inform driver training to increase awareness of cyclists at urban intersections, as well as the design of other traffic safety measures...|$|E

30|$|We {{performed}} <b>visual</b> <b>checks</b> of {{the accuracy}} of CT lesion delineation, based on these fixed density thresholds. For lesions with increased density (Vsoft, Vmedium, Vhard), the segmented areas corresponded well to lesion morphology. However, using −[*] 950 HU as the upper limit for low-density lesions was not specific enough for cavitation and the segmented areas in some cases included bullae, bronchiectasis, and severe emphysema. This necessitated an additional step to measure the volumes of individual cavities for each scan. This was done using the MRICro’s 3 D region-growing tool (boundary-based segmentation).|$|E

These checks included both co-registration and qualitative <b>visual</b> <b>checks.</b> Both software packages assessed used a semi-automatic linear (or rigid) registration algorithm to fuse PET and CT data together; therefore, computed alignment transformation between image modalities included, and were limited to, rotation, translation and scaling. Further manual spatial adjustments based on anatomical landmarks were made by a single reader in order to correctly register the two imaging modalities.|$|E

Remote calibration through the calibration coil of an instrument is an effective method for identifying the seismometer frequency response precisely.
