40|$|As {{electric}} vehicles {{appear as a}} potential solution for cleaner deliveries, several constraints affect the attractiveness of electric light commercial vehicles (eLCVs). Our research aims at identifying these constraints as well as quantifying their respective weight. We investigate two types of constraints: operational and economic. Operational constraints determine if an electric vehicle is suitable for a given use; for example, the limited range of operation due to the necessity to recharge the battery. Economic performance, which we examine through Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) computations for electric and conventional <b>vehicles,</b> <b>sheds</b> light upon the trade-offs faced by business users {{when they have to}} choose between several technologies. We then present the results of a disaggregated constraints analysis made on a French database about light commercial vehicles, which assesses the proportion of vehicles that could be replaced by electric ones, and at what costs. This study shows that, today, eLCVs are competitive for some specific uses, but do not cover the needs of every freight transport operator. Our analysis also shows that even if fuel prices remain low and financial incentives decline, the competitiveness of {{electric vehicles}} could grow in the future...|$|R
50|$|When the Stamford Bypass {{was first}} built in October 1960, the bypass {{terminated}} with a roundabout at Tickencote, with the B1081, and the dual-carriageway continued a half-mile north near Tickencote Park.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{a study of the}} airbraking portion of the flight of an Apollo class vehicle {{designed}} for a sortie from the Orbiter to Geo and return to Leo for Orbiter retrieval are presented. An ablative heat shield would be used on the <b>vehicle</b> to <b>shed</b> velocity to speeds commensurate with Orbiter rendezvous. A reference design was selected for a spacecraft configuration with an L/D ratio of 0. 3 and a weight to lift surface ratio of 236 lb/sq ft. Atmospheric guidance would consist of using the bank angle for altitude and inclination angle control and an equilibrium bank angle was defined. The vehicle would have a maximum temperature, considering a reference sphere, of 4800 F and a peak load of about 2 g. Atmospheric exit parameters were also determined, together with minimum delta-V for rendezvous...|$|R
5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{buildings of}} RAF Handforth are the government pay offices {{adjacent to the}} Total Fitness gym on Dairyhouse Lane. These buildings were the Headquarters of the depot and have survived in military/MoD use to this day. The depot had satellite sites within Cheadle Hulme, these being Site Number 5, general storage (beneath the Eden Park road housing development which, until the housing development began still maintained the internal road layout and building foundations) and site number 6 (motor transport storage area) which is now covered by part of the Hursthead housing estate. Three large (150ft × 250ft) steel built, <b>vehicle</b> storage <b>sheds</b> stood at the junction of Malmesbury Road and Lyncombe Close/Tintern Road. The last of these sheds survived well into the 1980s and was latterly used by the local council as a rubbish dump. This stood between Tollard Close and Tintern Road.

5000|$|The fort became {{surplus to}} {{requirements}} in 1965 {{when it was}} sold by the Ministry of Defence to Fareham Urban District Council. Shortly afterwards, in 1974, a contractor acting for a Property Company, who had leased the fort from Fareham Council, cleared the ramparts of vegetation by bulldozing it flat. All of the earth was stripped from the Haxo casemates, together with the earth forming the parapets and merlons, leaving the gun emplacements and expense magazines devoid of cover. One Haxo casemate was completely removed. The guard room and gateway were demolished together with the stables, sling wagon shed, movable armament shed, <b>vehicle</b> <b>shed</b> and portions of the parados before an injunction prevented further damage. The parade of the fort is entirely covered with Fort Fareham Business Park. The casemates are intact but have been converted to modern industrial units.|$|E
50|$|The Ungerer Tramway was {{the first}} {{electrical}} tramway in Munich. It was built by engineer {{and owner of the}} Ungerer Bath, August Ungerer to connect the bath with the 750m distant stop of the horse powered tramway. The 1.2 km long Ungerer Tramway existed from 1 July 1886 to June 1895, when it was adjusted because of the extension of the horse tramway until to the north cemetery. The current supply was made with x volt as at the Gross-Lichterfelde Tramway by the rails, which began only some meters after the last stops, which were increased. Thus for a start of the trip the brakes were loosened, whereby the train loose-rolled by the force of gravity, before it began to drive electrically. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>shed</b> with the clock tower for the two green motor coaches with gold ornament and two summer cars still stood in the year 1944.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{presents}} {{design of}} a single-nave hall with the span of 12 m and pole height from 3. 0 to 4. 5 m. The hall {{can be used for}} warehousing goods, garaging <b>vehicles</b> or <b>shedding</b> farm animals. Construction material is mostly round timber. The structure consists of a strut brace frame with reinforced saddle diaphragm beam in longitudinal module 3. 6 m, timber binding rafter and transversal trusses. Material, construction type and solution of details meet requirements and possibilities of do-it-yourself manufacture and assembly. The construction system of the hall has options for the rigid damp-proof roof course or for the prestressed canvas made of technical textile with water-proof surface finish. Foundation of the building is on concrete abutments, or – in a less traditional way – on concrete-encased poles in the ground shaft. Optional technical solutions (textile roofing, pole foundations) can reduce the framework costs including roofing by about 9 % and total house raising costs by about 45 %...|$|R

50|$|The TMD comprises:- The 'A' Maintenance Shed and Fuel Point {{were located}} at {{the east end of}} the depot and all locos on arrival passed the fuel point, {{consuming}} 15,000 gallons of fuel a day. This shed {{was the first of the}} new depot buildings and was used to maintain the fleet of diesel multiple units. The 'B' and 'C' Maintenance Sheds had four raised lines each able to hold two main line locos each with inspection pits and raised platforms for easy access. 'B' shed looked after small running repairs and examinations and all work on shunting locos. 'C' shed was equipped to carry out heavier repairs and larger examinations on main line engines only. Maintenance planning was done using the T.O.P.S. computer terminal in the Supervisor's office. The Traction Repair Shop carried out heavy repairs on locos, coaches and international ferry <b>vehicles.</b> This <b>shed</b> also housed two 40-ton overhead cranes and a wheel lathe for re-profiling wheel sets, a stores and small machine shop.|$|R
50|$|The Snow Mountain Ranger District was {{transferred}} from the Ochoco National Forest to the Malheur National Forest and incorporated the Emigrant Creek Ranger District around 2003. In 2005, the Malheur Nation Forest supervisor approved a project to renovate several of the Civilian Conservation Corps buildings. The project replaced deteriorating foundations, converted the warehouse into a fire crew bunkhouse, and improved the ranger station’s water system which included drilling a new well. During the project, the Forest Service was careful to preserve the historic character of the buildings. As a result, the Civilian Conservation Corps era structures remain eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places sometime in the future. A modern <b>vehicle</b> <b>shed</b> was also constructed {{as part of the}} 2005 project; however, the structure was designed to match the historic buildings at the site. Today, the bunkhouse and ranger residences are used during the summer to house a twelve-person fire fighting crew, and the Forest Service rents the Civilian Conservation Corps era cookhouse to recreational visitors.|$|E
50|$|The barracks {{is divided}} into three terraces. The first (top) terrace faces on to what is now Langsett Road. This {{contained}} the Mess establishment, quarters for around 40 officers and a similar number of servants, and a chapel. This building has a length of about 354 ft and a width and height of about 40 ft, is three storeys high and has a mixture of gothic and castellated styles. The other buildings of the barracks consisted of a large five-bedroomed house serving as the Garrison Commander’s Quarters outside the walls, a 58-patient two-storey hospital incorporating a barracks for RAMC personnel, a Dental Clinic and a facility for treating women, infantry soldiers' quarters, a clock tower building, with cavalry soldiers' quarters on the first floor and stabling for 260 horses on the ground floor (total accommodation for 918 NCO and other ranks). There was also a Fives Court, a Riding School, a school for 80 children and accommodation for the schoolmistress, married quarters flats for 50 families provided outside the walls, a Gun Shed housing six Field guns, the Barracks Store with living quarters for the Barracks Sergeant, a Guard Room incorporating a Police Room, Detention Cells, and an exercise yard, a <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Shed</b> (built in 1903) which could house 26 motor cars, a Veterinary Infirmary large enough to house 18 horses, a Granary, four cookhouses and various workshops.On the northern side of the Barracks runs the River Loxley. On the night of Friday 11 March 1864 the ill-fated Dale Dyke Dam further up the Loxley Valley at Bradfield burst causing the Great Sheffield Flood and the resulting flood waters breached a stone wall that was three feet thick. The water rose to the height of twelve feet outside the window of Sergeant Foulds' quarters and drowned two of his children.|$|E
40|$|Carsharing {{has grown}} {{considerably}} in North America {{during the past}} decade and has flourished within metropolitan regions across the United States and Canada. The result has been a new transportation landscape, which offers urban residents an alternative to automobility without car ownership. As carsharing has expanded, there has been a growing demand to understand its environmental impacts. This paper presents the results of a North American carsharing member survey (N = 6, 281). The authors establish a “before-and-after ” analytical design with a focus on carsharing’s impacts on household vehicle holdings and the aggregate vehicle population. The results show that carsharing members reduce their vehicle holdings to a degree that is statistically significant. The average vehicles per household of the sample drops from 0. 47 to 0. 24. Most of this shift constitutes one-car households becoming carless. The average fuel economy of carsharing vehicles used most often by respondents is 10 miles per gallon (mpg) more efficient than the average <b>vehicle</b> <b>shed</b> by respondents. The median age of vehicles shed by carsharing households is 11 years, but the distribution covers a considerable range. An aggregate analysi...|$|E
50|$|Most commonly, a {{household}} {{is a family}} unit of some kind, although households may also be other social groups, such as roommates or, in a rooming house, unconnected individuals. Some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar-sized group; larger houses called townhouses or row houses may contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure. A house may be accompanied by outbuildings, such as a garage for <b>vehicles</b> or a <b>shed</b> for gardening equipment and tools. A house may have a backyard or frontyard, which serve as additional areas where inhabitants can relax or eat.|$|R
5000|$|In 1915 Short Brothers bought land in {{the parish}} to build {{airships}} for the Admiralty and constructed a 700-foot-long (210 m) airship hangar to build the two R31 class airships. They also built a housing estate for workers which they named Shortstown. The site was nationalized in 1919 and {{became known as the}} Royal Airship Works.The shed was extended in 1926 and its roof was raised to accommodate the R101. A second shed was moved here from RNAS Pulham, Norfolk,in 1928, but after the crash of the R101 in 1930, all work stopped in Britain on airships and the site became a storage station. It became known as RAF Cardington in 1936 and started building barrage balloons and became the No 1 RAF Balloon Training Unit. The site has since been used for a variety of other purposes by a number of organizations including the Royal Aircraft Establishment, the Building Research Establishment, the Meteorological Research Unit, Airship Industries and Hybrid Air <b>Vehicles.</b> The <b>sheds</b> are both listed buildings, [...] but Hangar Number 1 is at risk, needing complete repair and refurbishment.|$|R
