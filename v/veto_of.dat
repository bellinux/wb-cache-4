5|$|On September 12, 2012, Cierpiot {{voted to}} {{overturn}} Governor Jay Nixon's <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> SB749. The bill allowed health insurance providers {{to refuse to}} provide coverage for contraception based on moral convictions.|$|E
5|$|A {{major issue}} in her initial {{election}} was whether the two candidates would vote to override President George W. Bush's <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> {{an expansion of the}} State Children's Health Insurance Program. Tsongas said she would vote to override, and it was reported Ogonowski would uphold the veto. Hours after being sworn into office on October 18, Tsongas voted to override, but the vote failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority.|$|E
5|$|The College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) {{has a long}} {{affiliation}} with Syracuse University, shares many campus resources, and operates its main academic campus immediately adjacent to Syracuse University. ESF was founded in 1911 as the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University, {{under the leadership of}} Syracuse University Trustee Louis Marshall, with the active support of Syracuse University Chancellor Day. Its founding followed the Governor's <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> annual appropriations to a separate New York State College of Forestry at Cornell.|$|E

5000|$|Moffat was {{an active}} member of the Fire Department, the Mechanic's Society, and {{president}} of St. Andrew's Society. [...] In 1871, he was elected mayor of Detroit as a Republican. [...] Moffat served two terms as mayor, with his administration notable for his <b>vetoes</b> <b>of</b> spending initiative passed by the Detroit City Council and <b>vetoes</b> <b>of</b> multiple authorizations to allow saloons to open on Sunday afternoons in Detroit. [...] By the time he stepped down as mayor, Moffat had earned the appellation [...] "Honest Hugh Moffat." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{legislature}} {{largely ignored}} the governor's message {{in favor of}} partisan concerns. A pure food and drug law was enacted without his signature. His <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> controversial legislation regulating railroad rates, however, was sustained. Both houses passed a resolution calling for the resignation of Senator William Lindsay, a Gold Democrat who did not support William Jennings Bryan's presidential bid, on grounds {{that he no longer}} represented the interests of his party. Lindsay responded that he represented the people of Kentucky and refused to resign his seat.|$|E
5|$|After {{just half}} a year as vice president, Arthur {{found himself in the}} {{executive}} mansion due to the assassination of his predecessor. To the surprise of reformers, Arthur took up the cause of reform, though it had once led to his expulsion from office. He signed the Pendleton Act into law and strongly enforced its provisions. He gained praise for his <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> a Rivers and Harbors Act that would have appropriated federal funds in a manner he thought excessive. He presided over the rebirth of the United States Navy, but was criticized for failing to alleviate the federal budget surplus, which had been accumulating {{since the end of the}} Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Although Minton {{supported}} the Roosevelt Administration {{and became a}} regular guest at the White House, Minton opposed the president on some measures. He voted to override a presidential <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> a grant of $2.5 ($ billion in 2015 dollars) in bonus pay for World War I soldiers (Bonus Army). He {{supported the}} Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, which Roosevelt feared would cost the party support in the southern states. He also supported {{an extension of the}} Hatch Act of 1939, a law that prevented federal employees from being forced to take part in state election campaigns, effectively lessening the influence of federal patronage.|$|E
50|$|Despite President Bush's <b>vetoes</b> <b>of</b> funding {{bills with}} {{withdrawal}} timetables, Edwards urged Congressional Democrats to not acquiesce, but instead to continually present bills that include such timetables.|$|R
50|$|Tawfik Tirawi, {{a member}} of Fatah's Central Committee, called upon Palestinians to hold a 'day of rage' the {{following}} Friday to protest the American <b>vetoing</b> <b>of</b> the resolution.|$|R
25|$|Romney <b>vetoed</b> the {{transfer}} <b>of</b> {{funds from the}} contingency account. The veto was overturned by the legislature, and indeed for the 2006 budget, all 250 line-item vetoes were overturned, and for the entire year of 2006, all <b>of</b> Romney's <b>vetoes</b> <b>of</b> legislative bills were subsequently overturned by the Massachusetts Legislature.|$|R
5|$|Born to Irish immigrants, Talbot was {{minimally}} educated, {{working in}} textile mills {{from an early}} age. He entered into a partnership with his brother, founding the Talbot Mills of Billerica in 1857. He became politically active, partly due to issues with the mills, and served two terms as Lieutenant Governor, acting as Governor {{for part of the}} second term after Governor William B. Washburn won election to the United States Senate. Talbot was a strong temperance advocate, and his <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> a popular alcohol licensing bill contributed to his loss in the 1874 gubernatorial race. He was more successful in 1878 against divided opposition, serving a single lackluster term.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge began reforms {{immediately}} and zealously. He secured the General Assembly's {{passage of a}} two-cent property tax for education. The tax was subject to voter approval, and Breckinridge worked hard to publicize the issue. His efforts paid off, as the tax passed by almost a two-to-one margin. Continuing to publicize needs and push legislators to action, Breckinridge enjoyed the support of {{five of the six}} governors under whom he served. Only John L. Helm, who opposed a state-funded school system, challenged him, but Helm's <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> a Breckinridge educational bill was overridden in the General Assembly. Breckinridge's reforms manifested tangible results. From 1847 to 1850, educational spending increased from $6,000 to $144,000. By 1850, only one out of every ten school age children did not attend school.|$|E
5|$|By 1826, {{economic}} prosperity {{was beginning to}} return to the state. The Old Court party augmented their majority in the House and gained a majority in the Senate. One legislator's proposition to resolve the controversy was to call for the resignation of the governor and lieutenant governor, the entire General Assembly, as well as the justices from both the Old and New Courts, essentially allowing the state to reset its entire government. This extreme measure was rejected. Instead, on December 29, 1826, the General Assembly repealed the reorganization act, and overrode Governor Desha's <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> the measure. They also repealed the replevin law that had touched off the controversy. On January 1, 1827, Francis Blair returned the court records in his possession to the Old Court.|$|E
50|$|The Republican-dominated {{legislature}} passed {{bills in}} a special session before he took office to reduce {{the power of the}} governor. The legislature has overridden several <b>of</b> his <b>vetoes</b> <b>of</b> legislation.|$|R
50|$|The 1981 {{selection}} set many precedents. The {{system of}} straw polls, which broke the deadlock, was adopted for future selections. China's 16 <b>vetoes</b> <b>of</b> Waldheim confirmed the two-term limit and established {{the principle of}} regional rotation.|$|R
50|$|Pro-Bank forces reacted {{even more}} {{strongly}} {{to the executive}} action than they had to Jackson's <b>vetoing</b> <b>of</b> the recharter bill. The president discerned that Congress might find the votes to reverse his orders with a two-thirds majority.|$|R
5|$|Magoffin and the {{legislature}} continued to clash throughout {{the remainder of}} 1861 and into 1862. They found agreement only on the most menial of legislation, such as a bill to allow the common schools to continue the sessions that had been interrupted by the outbreak of hostilities in 1861. He found particularly onerous a bill forfeiting the citizenship of anyone who fought for or aided the Confederacy, but in March 1862, his <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> the bill was overridden. Magoffin also opposed the military rule of Brigadier General Jeremiah T. Boyle, who he believed was violating {{the civil rights of}} states' rights advocates, even if they did not advocate secession.|$|E
5|$|Truman cooperated {{closely with}} the Republican leaders on foreign policy, though he fought them bitterly on {{domestic}} issues. The power of the labor unions was significantly curtailed by the Taft–Hartley Act, which was enacted over Truman's veto. Truman twice vetoed bills to lower income tax rates in 1947. Although the initial vetoes were sustained, Congress overrode his <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> a tax cut bill in 1948. The parties did cooperate on some issues; Congress passed the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, making the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate rather than the Secretary of State next in line to the presidency after the Vice President.|$|E
5|$|When {{the media}} asked King Juan Carlos {{if he would}} sign the bill that was being debated in the Cortes Generales, he {{answered}} {{that he was the}} King of Spain, not of Belgiuma reference to King Baudouin of Belgium, who refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion. For the King to withhold his royal assent, it would effect a <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> the legislation. However, the King gave his royal assent to Law 13/2005 on 1 July 2005, and the law was gazetted in the Boletín Oficial del Estado on 2 July, and came into effect on 3 July. The King received criticism by Carlist and other far right conservatives for signing the legislation.|$|E
50|$|While {{the shuttle}} bombing {{technique}} complicated German air defenses, in practice most targets were already coming in reach of US bomber streams from Italy and England. Soviet <b>vetoing</b> <b>of</b> some targets prevented more {{effective use of}} the bases.|$|R
50|$|Tan also {{proposed}} an Annual Statement for greater transparency for Singaporeans {{to better understand}} the president's activities and ideas in unifying Singapore. The statement also touches on Singapore's reserves and the rationale behind the appointment or <b>vetoing</b> <b>of</b> civil servants.|$|R
5000|$|... "Besides {{being the}} acting secretary, Conner was former President George W. Bush’s hatchet man on {{payments}} limits until Congress finally said enough and overrode two <b>vetoes</b> <b>of</b> the farm bill. Chuck Hassebrook {{has been making}} those same arguments for 35 years." [...] (2009) ...|$|R
5|$|A House select {{committee}} headed by John Quincy Adams, an ardent abolitionist who disliked slaveholders like Tyler, condemned the president's {{use of the}} veto and assailed his character. While the committee's report did not formally recommend impeachment, it clearly established the possibility, and in August 1842 the House endorsed the committee's report. Adams sponsored {{a constitutional amendment to}} change both houses' two-thirds requirement (for overriding vetoes) to a simple majority, but neither house approved. The Whigs were unable to pursue further impeachment proceedings in the subsequent 28th Congress—in the elections of 1842 they retained a majority in the Senate but lost control of the House. Near the end of Tyler's term in office, on March 3, 1845, Congress overrode his <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> a minor bill relating to revenue cutters—the first override of a presidential veto.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{brought his}} {{opposition}} to needless spending to the governor's office; he promptly sent the legislature eight vetos {{in his first two}} months in office. The first to attract attention was his <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> a bill to reduce the fares on New York City elevated trains to five cents. The bill had broad support because the trains' owner, Jay Gould, was unpopular, and his fare increases were widely denounced. Cleveland, however, saw the bill as unjust—Gould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again. Moreover, Cleveland believed that altering Gould's franchise would violate the Contract Clause of the federal Constitution. Despite the initial popularity of the fare-reduction bill, the newspapers praised Cleveland's veto. Theodore Roosevelt, then a member of the Assembly, had reluctantly voted for the bill to which Cleveland objected, in a desire to punish the unscrupulous railroad barons. After the veto, Roosevelt reversed himself, as did many legislators, and the veto was sustained.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} Republican victory in November 1866, Johnson {{considered}} {{himself in a}} strong position. The Fourteenth Amendment had been ratified by none of the Southern or border states except Tennessee, and had been rejected in Kentucky, Delaware, and Maryland. As the amendment required ratification by three-quarters of the states {{to become part of}} the Constitution, he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor, leading to his election in 1868. Once it reconvened in December 1866, an energized Congress began passing legislation, often over a presidential veto; this included the District of Columbia voting bill. Congress admitted Nebraska to the Union over a veto, and the Republicans gained two senators and a state that promptly ratified the amendment. Johnson's <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> a bill for statehood for Colorado Territory was sustained; enough senators agreed that a district with a population of 30,000 was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day.|$|E
25|$|As of July 2008, Buchanan {{had voted}} to {{override}} five <b>of</b> President Bush's <b>vetoes</b> <b>of</b> legislation {{passed by the}} 110th Congress. These override votes included a vote in support of expanding the coverage range of the SCHIP program, the 2008 farm bill, and the Water Resources Development Act.|$|R
50|$|On Day 67, Arisa {{told the}} houseguests that the {{eviction}} {{take place on}} the night following the Power <b>of</b> <b>Veto</b> Ceremony. After Jon used the Power <b>of</b> <b>Veto</b> on himself, Neda was nominated in his place. Following the Power <b>of</b> <b>Veto</b> ceremony, Jon evicted Heather from the Big Brother Canada House.|$|R
50|$|President Andrew Johnson's <b>vetoes</b> <b>of</b> these {{measures}} were overridden by Congress. After Ex Parte McCardle (1867) {{came before the}} Supreme Court, Congress feared that the Court might strike the Reconstruction Acts down as unconstitutional. To prevent this, Congress repealed the Habeas Corpus Act 1867, revoking the Supreme Court's jurisdiction over the case.|$|R
5|$|Kennedy {{staged a}} tiring, dangerous, and {{high-profile}} trip to South Africa in January 1985. He defied both the apartheid government's wishes and militant leftist AZAPO demonstrators by spending {{a night in}} the Soweto home of Bishop Desmond Tutu and also visited Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela. Upon returning, Kennedy became {{a leader in the}} push for economic sanctions against South Africa; collaborating with Senator Lowell Weicker, he secured Senate passage, and the overriding of Reagan's <b>veto,</b> <b>of</b> the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. Despite their many political differences, Kennedy and Reagan had a good personal relationship, and with the administration's approval Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union in 1986 to act as a go-between in arms control negotiations with reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The discussions were productive, and Kennedy also helped gain the release of a number of Soviet Jewish refuseniks, including Anatoly Shcharansky.|$|E
5|$|On August 18, 1918, {{incumbent}} senator Ollie M. James died. Stanley appointed George B. Martin {{to finish}} James' term, {{which was to}} expire on March 3 of the following year. James had already been nominated for re-election in 1918 by the Democratic primary, and the task of selecting the party's new nominee fell to the Democratic State Committee, which nominated Stanley. Stanley enjoyed {{the advantage of a}} united Democratic party; J. C. W. Beckham supported Stanley for this seat so Stanley would not challenge him for his own seat when he faced re-election. The Republicans chose a relative unknown, Dr. Ben L. Bruner. Stanley was attacked for his <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> the German language bill and for his long-standing views against temperance. Though the national mood was against the Democrats, a letter of support from President Woodrow Wilson bolstered Stanley's campaign, and he defeated Bruner by more than 5,000 votes. He resigned as governor to assume the Senate seat in May 1919. As a Democrat in a mostly Republican Senate, he wielded little influence.|$|E
5|$|On two issues, women's suffrage, and the {{prohibition}} of alcohol, where picking the wrong side would have damaged his presidential prospects in 1920, he prospered by taking nuanced positions. As senator-elect, he indicated {{that he could not}} support votes for women until Ohio did. Increased support for suffrage there and among Senate Republicans meant that by the time Congress voted on the issue, Harding was a firm supporter. Harding, who drank, initially voted against banning alcohol. He voted for the Eighteenth Amendment, which imposed Prohibition, after successfully moving to modify it by placing a time limit on ratification, which was expected to kill it. Once it was ratified anyway, Harding voted to override Wilson's <b>veto</b> <b>of</b> the Volstead Bill, which implemented the amendment, assuring the support of the Anti-Saloon League.|$|E
50|$|President John Tyler {{nominated}} Caleb Cushing for Secretary of the Treasury. Tyler had {{a contentious}} {{relationship with the}} Senate over his <b>vetos</b> <b>of</b> legislation, and the Senate refused to confirm Cushing for this office on March 3, 1843. Tyler renominated Cushing twice more that day, and both times the Senate rejected his nomination.|$|R
5000|$|The Power <b>of</b> <b>Veto</b> {{is a power}} first {{introduced}} in Big Brother 3. During its first season, it {{was referred to as}} the Silver Power <b>of</b> <b>Veto,</b> and did not allow a nominated HouseGuest to use the Power <b>of</b> <b>Veto</b> on themselves. The final Power <b>of</b> <b>Veto</b> that season was the Golden Power <b>of</b> <b>Veto,</b> and allowed a nominated HouseGuest to remove themself from the block. Following this, the Golden Power <b>of</b> <b>Veto</b> was used in all subsequent seasons. The Diamond Power <b>of</b> <b>Veto,</b> used in Big Brother 12 allowed one HouseGuest to remove themselves from the block, as well as choose the replacement nominee only moments before the live eviction. Power <b>of</b> <b>Veto</b> competitions differ drastically from the Head of Household competition, with PoV competitions being more skill based in nature. Competitions such as the [...] "Pop Goes the Veto!" [...] competition, which required HouseGuest to find letter tiles and spell the longest word, have been used in numerous consecutive seasons. Competitions such as the [...] "Big Brother Boardwalk" [...] competition see HouseGuests attempting to guess how much of an item there is; this is one of various competitions that do not require HouseGuests to compete in a physical based competition. The [...] "How Bad Do You Want It?" [...] Power <b>of</b> <b>Veto</b> competition, {{first introduced}} in the seventh season, saw HouseGuests taking punishments in exchange for advancing in the competition. Variations of this competition have been used in numerous subsequent seasons. HouseGuests Janelle Pierzina and Daniele Donato currently hold the record for most Power <b>of</b> <b>Veto</b> wins in a single season, with five wins each. HouseGuests James Zinkand, Frank Eudy, and Shane Meaney all hold the record for most consecutive Power <b>of</b> <b>Veto</b> wins, with three each.|$|R
50|$|The Rockefeller {{nomination}} {{was approved by}} mid-December, but Congress overrode presidential <b>vetoes</b> <b>of</b> both a vocational rehabilitation bill and a measure amending the Freedom of Information Act. Congress also approved, and the President signed, a bill that nullified a prior agreement giving former President Nixon control over the tapes and papers of his administration.|$|R
