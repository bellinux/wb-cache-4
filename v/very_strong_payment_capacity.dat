The study employs 391 forecasted yearly cash-flows statements collected from 50 companies from Timis County (Romania), as well as the detailed hypotheses of the forecasts. The results of the study facilitate the determination and classification of the main sensitivity factors for the <b>payment</b> <b>capacity</b> at sample level, the establishment of general benchmarks for the <b>payment</b> <b>capacity</b> (as no such benchmarks currently exist in the Romanian literature) and the identification of the mechanisms through which the variation of different factors impacts the <b>payment</b> <b>capacity...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{market prices}} of {{developing}} countries'debts are imperfect {{indicators of the}} countries'payment capacity for three reasons: the concave shape of the debt's payoff structure, the presence of third-party guarantees, and {{the differences in the}} terms of various debt claims. Claessens and Pennacchi derive an improved indicator of payment capacityby developing a pricing model - using option valuation techniques - that takes these three factors into account. Applying the model to bonds issued recently by Mexico and Venezuela, they find that the estimated indicator of <b>payment</b> <b>capacity</b> often behaves differently from the raw bond prices themselves, confirming the importance of cleaning the raw prices for these three factors. In order of importance, the benefits of cleaning raw prices come first from correcting for the effects of different terms (such as fixed versus floating interest rates), followed by the value of third-party enhancements and then by the concavity of the payoff structure. They find some evidence that the new indicator of repayment capacity conforms better than the raw prices themselves to generally held beliefs about which variables drive a country's repayment capacity. In particular, they find that variables that are often assumed to be related to <b>payment</b> <b>capacity</b> - such as oil prices and the countries'stock market prices - are more closely (and with the right sign) associated with the new estimated measure of <b>payment</b> <b>capacity</b> than are the secondary market prices of the bonds.

40|$|Abstract — The {{optimality}} of separable encoding and decoding over parallel channels (fading states) for ergodic fading twouser interference channels (IFCs) is studied using {{a one-sided}} IFC as a model. For an ergodic fading one-sided IFC with nonfading direct links and a fading cross-channel link, it is shown that separability can be strictly suboptimal {{except for the}} cases where all the parallel channels are of the same type, i. e., {{all of them are}} either <b>strong</b> but not <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> or <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> channels. A recent result on the sum-capacities of the classes of ergodic <b>strong</b> and <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> IFCs is used to show that encoding and decoding jointly over all parallel channels is optimal when either the <b>strong</b> or <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> interference conditions hold on average over all channels.
