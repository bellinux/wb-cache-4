40|$|Global {{awareness}} and preservation have spurred increasing interest in utilizing environmentally friendly materials for high-performance structural applications. Biocomposites pose an appealing {{solution to this}} issue and are characterized by their sustainable lifecycles, biodegradable qualities, light weight, remarkable strength, and exceptional stiffness. Many of these structural qualities are found in applications that exhibit flexural loading conditions, and this study focuses on improving the bending performance of engineered biocomposite structures. The current application of biocomposites is increasing rapidly, so this expanding research explores other natural constituent materials for biocomposite structures under flexural loading. The renewable material investigated {{in this study was}} experimentally and numerically validated by optimizing the mechanical characteristics of bamboo fibers in biocomposite structures under flexural loading conditions through various thermal and organic chemical treatment methods. Therefore, bending performance of a biocomposite truss and I-beam are analyzed to demonstrate the benefits of utilizing optimally treated bamboos in their design. To accomplish this goal, the first task consisted of treating bamboos by thermal and chemical means to determine the resulting effects on the compressive and tensile mechanical properties through experimental testing. Results indicated a significant improvement in strength, stiffness, and weight reduction. An extensive analysis determined the optimal treatment method that was utilized for flexural loading conditions. The second task entailed studying the flexural behavior of the optimally treated bamboo in two geometric configurations, a hollow cylinder and <b>veneer</b> <b>strip,</b> to determine the resultant properties for the truss and I-beam structure. The effect of node location on flexural performance was also studied to establish design guidelines for the applied structures. Bending tests indicated that node location affects the strength and stiffness of the hollow cylindrical configuration but has minimal effects on the <b>veneer</b> <b>strip.</b> Observations discovered by this study were employed into the designs of the applied structures that yielded excellent mechanical performance through flexural testing. The final task required conducting a finite element analysis in Abaqus/CAE on the performance of each structural application to validate experimental results. A conclusive analysis revealed good agreement between the numerical method and experimental result...|$|E
40|$|The {{remarkable}} {{properties of}} the EWPs (Engineered Wood Products) are high, directional mechanical properties. From {{the orientation of the}} function structural elements (FSE) an unmistakable structure results. This structure can be recognized both in the surface and in the edges. As far as no veneers are applied, the production of the FSE requires special knife ring flakers or disc flakers. With both methods the round timber is cut up directly into the desired wooden parts. Few consideration was given to alternative procedures of the lamination of wood, from which also inferior raw materials (thinning, sawing by-products) FSE can be obtained. On the basis of a description of the former cutting up technology in the wood-based panels industry, two new machine cutting methods for the production of strands as well as the characteristics of the boards are represented. By means of the new methods either usual strands of OSB from large chips (maxi chips) or uniform strands for new high-strength wood based panels can be gained. As VSL (<b>Veneer</b> <b>Strip</b> Lumber) the indicated high-strength wood based panels is an economic alternative to previous materials...|$|E

A plywood double girder ran centrally along the bottom of the mid-fuselage to the engine bulkhead, forming a mounting for the lower wing pylon, the cockpit and controls and parts of the engine mounting and undercarriage. The fuselage and tail surfaces were fabric covered except for a veneered region around the open cockpit, set under the wing trailing edge. The wide chord fin had a curved leading edge; the two-piece tailplane was fixed to the upper longerons. The control surfaces were unbalanced and had non-rigid trailing edges, the fabric taking up a scalloped shape.|$|R

Leaf litter inputs {{have been}} {{excluded}} from 1 of 2 Ist-order streams at Coweeta Hydro-logic Laboratory, North Carolina since August 1993 {{to examine the}} bottom-up effects of resource reduction on stream ecosystems. As {{part of the larger}} project, we studied the effect of litter exclusion on the extracellular enzyme activity and fungal biomass of wood biofilms in the presence and absence of leaf litter. Replicate <b>strips</b> of wood <b>veneer</b> were incubated in both streams for 28, 58, and 86 d. Ergosterol content (to estimate fungal biomass), the activity of 5 lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, acid phosphatase activity, breakdown rates, and % organic matter were determined when the <b>veneer</b> <b>strips</b> were collected. Hydrolytic enzyme activity and wood breakdown rates in the litter-excluded stream were significantly higher than in the reference stream. Enzyme activities of all hydrolytic enzymes were highly correlated with each other. Measurement of relative activities of selected extra-cellular enzymes comparing carbon and nutrient acquisition suggested nutrient limitation of hetero-trophic biofilms in the reference stream. Microbial activity of wood biofilms was significantly altered by the exclusion of leaf litter, and hydrolytic enzyme activity, as an indicator of carbon cycling, was higher on wood in streams without leaf litter.

40|$|As its {{production}} increased tenfold {{in the last}} ten years in Europe, OSB represents today more than a simple alternative to plywood. While it could be now considered as a well-established wood-based panel, oriented strand boards do not yet achieve optimal properties. Proof of this are the technological developments being carried out intensively in RTD for every process step, from flaking until pressing. This paper deals in two first parts with possibilities of assessing crucial parameters such as strand size and orientation using innovative off-line and on-line methods. The latter are based on image processing and were developed at the Fraunhofer insitute, Wilhelm-Klauditz-Institute for Wood Research (WKI) for answering both industrial and laboratory needs in matter of optimization of structure. Particular attention was paid to the statistical characterization of a batch of strands: It was shown that main dimensions of a population of strands are mostly lognormally distributed and then may be described using a small set of suitable indices. Numerous batches were analysed and the influence of climatic and processing parameters on post-disintegration was investigated. For industrial applications, an on-line mat quality assessment system ready for use between the forming station and the press was developed. To illustrate possibilities of structure optimization, results of investigations of strengthening of OSB with strands of optimal geometry will be presented. Thanks to additions of small quantities of <b>veneer</b> <b>strips,</b> the so-called "uniform strands", the bending properties of panels were highly increased. Advantages could be taken of that statement by saving on adhesive amounts so as to reach properties required by norms, or by putting on the market a strengthened OSB. The surface evenness that affects the suitability of OSB regarding painting and coating was also assessed using a measuring technique based on fringe-projection and image processing. The quantitative analysis shows how uniform strands close pores on surface and make the product more appropriate to coating...|$|R

From hand shaped solid wood, to lightweight volumetric forms, I have developed a language that explores the role of line, space, symmetry, structure, and material. I am influenced by {{the natural beauty of}} botanical forms, the line and repetition of boat building practices, the innovation and craftsmanship of furniture, and the spontaneity of sculpture. Each piece explores an amount of my devotion to furniture making and its role in my process of sketching, drawing, designing, and creating work. The study as a whole is directly influenced by my lifestyle and life choices as an artist devoted to woodworking. I’ve decided to spend my life designing and making furniture. I find the field of furniture design intriguing because it’s a way use woodworking and design to show the world my interpretation of furniture. Making my own artistic work based on my life allows me to clarify those life experiences, expand, and find rationale for day to day thinking as it relates to my work. Throughout the study, I was confronted with the meaning of my process, and learning how the ability to manipulate it will really impact what I make. The initial goal of this thesis was to have a thorough personal investigation of form and technique through furniture making. I wanted to understand why I am attracted to organic, recurved, volumes and shapes, and how that relates to my desire to use specific woodworking techniques such as shaping with hand tools, or laminating <b>veneer</b> <b>strips</b> to make volumes. However, throughout physically making the body of work, that intention evolved into a larger and much more intimate study. I certainly investigated form and technique, but more importantly it became clear that I needed to gain an understanding of my own design process to have better control of the outcome of my work. Part of the process that I am trying to understand is deciding what to make, what truly inspires me and why, and what audience my work speaks to...|$|R
