40|$|On August 3 rd and 4 th, 2015, a {{workshop}} {{was held at}} the NASA Ames Research Center, located at the Moffett Federal Airfield in California to explore the aviation communities interest in Transformative Vertical Flight (TVF) Concepts. The Workshop was sponsored by the AHS International (AHS), the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and hosted by the NASA Aeronautics Research Institute (NARI). This second annual workshop built on the success and enthusiasm generated by the first TVF Workshop held in Washington, DC in August of 2014. The previous Workshop identified the existence of a multi-disciplinary community interested in this topic and established a consensus among the participants that opportunities to establish further collaborations in this area are warranted. The desire to conduct a series of annual workshops augmented by online virtual technical seminars to strengthen the TVF community and continue planning for advocacy and collaboration was a direct outcome of the first Workshop. The second Workshop organizers focused on four desired action-oriented outcomes. The first was to establish and document common stakeholder needs and areas of potential collaborations. This includes advocacy strategies to encourage the future success of unconventional <b>vertiport</b> capable flight concept solutions that are enabled by emerging technologies. The second was to assemble a community that can collaborate on new conceptual design and analysis tools to permit novel configuration paths with far greater multi-disciplinary coupling (i. e., aero-propulsive-control) to be investigated. The third was to establish a community to develop and deploy regulatory guidelines. This community would have the potential to initiate formation of an American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F 44 Committee Subgroup for the development of consensus-based certification standards for General Aviation scale <b>vertiport</b> capable flight systems. These standards need to accommodate novel fixed wing concepts that do not fit within the existing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rotorcraft certification framework (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter I, Subchapter C, Part 27). The fourth desired outcome was to launch an information campaign to ensure key U. S. Government agencies understand the potential benefits and industry interest in establishing new <b>vertiport</b> capable flight markets. This record of the Workshop proceedings documents Workshop activities and products including summaries of the video recorded technical presentations, overviews of three breakout sessions (Missions Operational Concepts, Prioritized Technical Challenges, Regulatory Roadmap), and a preliminary draft roadmap framework for TVF...|$|E
40|$|A mid-fidelity {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} tool called RotCFD - specifically developed to aid in rotorcraft conceptual design efforts - {{has been applied to}} the study of rotor wake interactions of civil tiltrotor aircraft in the immediate vicinity of vertiport/airport ground infrastructure. This issue has grown in importance as previous NASA studies have suggested that civil tiltrotor aircraft can potentially {{have a significant impact on}} commercial transport aviation. Current NASA reference designs for such civil tiltrotor aircraft are focused on a size category of 90 - 120 passengers. Notional concepts of operations include simultaneous non-interfering flight into and out of congested airports having <b>vertiports,</b> that is, prepared VTOL takeoff and landing zones, or underutilized short runways for STOL operation. Such large gross-weight vehicles will be generating very high induced velocities. Inevitably, the interaction of the rotor wake with ground infrastructure such as terminals/jetways must be considered both from an operational as well as design perspective...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of a new aircraft {{that is capable of}} solving the increasing demand of inter-city transportation has attracted the attention of the aerospace industry for quite some time. Under the High Speed Rotorcraft Concept (HSRC) program, both NASA and the U. S. helicopter industry have studied a series of candidate rotorcraft configurations capable of cruising at high speeds and capable of taking off and landing vertically at <b>vertiports</b> located at downtown. Among these candidates, the stopped rotor/wing configuration has been the least studied due to lack of appropriate analytical tools to assist in its design and due to a general lack of understanding of the physics behind this unconventional concept. Even though the HSRC program has since been canceled, Georgia Tech's Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory (ASDL) recognized the need for a design methodology capable of handling the synthesis and sizing of such vehicles and has continued its pursuit. Therefore, such a computer simulat [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for {{commercial air transportation}} results in delays due to traffic queues that form bottlenecks along final approach and departure corridors. In urban areas, it is often infeasible to build new runways, and regardless of automa-tion upgrades traffic must remain separated to avoid the wakes of previous aircraft. Vertical or short takeoff and landing aircraft as Runway Independent Aircraft (RIA) can increase passenger throughput at major urban airports via the use of <b>vertiports</b> or stub runways. The concept of simultaneous non-interfering (SNI) operations has been proposed to reduce traffic delays by creating approach and departure corridors that do not intersect existing fixed-wing routes. However, SNI trajectories open new routes that may overfly noise-sensitive areas, and RIA may generate more noise than traditional jet aircraft, particularly on approach. In this dissertation, we develop efficient SNI noise abatement procedures appli-cable to RIA. First, we introduce a methodology based on modified approximated cell-decomposition and Dijkstraâ€™s search algorithm to optimize longitudinal plane (2 -D) RIA trajectories over a cost function that minimizes noise, time, and fue...|$|R
40|$|The {{commercial}} passenger {{market for}} the civil tiltrotor was examined in phase 2. A market responsive commercial tiltrotor {{was found to be}} technically feasible, and a significant worldwide market potential was found to exist for such an aircraft, especially for relieving congestion in urban area-to-urban area service and for providing cost effective hub airport feeder service. Potential technical obstacles of community noise, <b>vertiport</b> area navigation, surveillance, and control, and the pilot/aircraft interface were determined to be surmountable. Nontechnical obstacles relating to national commitment and leadership and development of ground and air infrastructure were determined to be more difficult to resolve; an innovative public/private partnership is suggested to allow coordinated development of an initial commercial tiltrotor network to relieve congestion in the crowded US Northeast corridor by the year 2000...|$|E
40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{recently}} completed a series of contracts and studies that examined the technology needs for a tiltrotor aircraft in commercial service as well as military missions. The commercial needs arise out of market-driven requirements that include <b>vertiport</b> location and design, passenger comfort levels and competitive costs. The military needs are derived from time-sensitive missions and combat effectiveness. In response to these results, NASA has decided to address the commercial needs first, recognizing {{that there will be}} eventual payoff to military missions as well. Research goals were explored in acoustics, flight dynamics, human factors and displays, dynamics and loads, propulsion, safety, and configuration design. The paper describes the development of these goals from the market requirements and the implications for possible research activities. The aircraft issues that were addressed include number of blades, advanced blade planforms, steep approach requirements and pilot-cockpit interface for civil operations...|$|E
40|$|A {{tiltrotor}} transport has considerable {{potential as}} a regional transport, increasing the air transportation system capacity by off-loading conventional runways. Such an aircraft will have a flight deck suited to its air transportation task and adapted to unique urban <b>vertiport</b> operating requirements. Such operations are likely to involve steep, slow instrument approaches for vertical and extremely short rolling take-offs and landings. While much of a tiltrotor transport's operations will be in common with commercial fixed-wing operations, terminal area operations will impose alternative flight deck design solutions. Control systems, displays and guidance, and control inceptors must be tailored to both routine and emergency vertical flight operations. This paper will survey recent experience with flight deck design elements suitable to a tiltrotor transport and will propose a conceptual cockpit design for such an aircraft. A series of piloted simulations using the NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator have investigated cockpit design elements and operating requirements for tiltrotor transports operating into urban vertiports. These experiments have identified {{the need for a}} flight director or equivalent display guidance for steep final approaches. A flight path vector display format has proven successful for guiding tiltrotor transport terminal area operations. Experience with a Head-Up Display points to the need for a bottom-mounted display device to maximize its utility on steep final approach paths. Configuration control (flap setting and nacelle angle) requires appropriate augmentation and tailoring for civil transport operations, flown to an airline transport pilot instrument flight rules (ATP-IFR) standard. The simulation experiments also identified one thrust control lever geometry as inappropriate to the task and found at least acceptable results with the vertical thrust control lever of the XV- 15. In addition to the thrust controller, the attitude control of a tiltrotor transport may be effected through an inceptor other than the current center sticks in the XV- 15 and V- 22. Simulation and flight investigations of side-stick control inceptors for rotorcraft, augmented by a 1985 flight test of a side-stick controller in the XV- 15 suggest the potential of such a device in a transport cockpit...|$|E
40|$|Historically, the {{approach}} to community planning and the preparation of a master plan has involved a two-dimensional visual 'land-use' methodology. Typically, land has been treated as a surface two-dimensional plane. This traditional approach is inadequate for preparing creative solutions for existing urban problems or more importantly for strategically planning and position ing a community for the 21 st century. A more visionary approach involves sensory spatial systems simulation (S 4) which examines a community three-dimensionally from a spatial perspective, incorporating all five senses, and simulating potential planning solutions by using multimedia technology including visualization, geographic information systems, and computer-aided design. This (S 4) approach is being applied {{for the development of}} an intermodal transportation planning vertical flight demonstration for the 1996 Summer Olympics to be held in Atlanta, Georgia, and for upgrading the more conventional approach to military master planning with Fort Lewis, Washington, as a 21 st-century model. One research initiative is underway for the Federal Aviation Administration to develop an S 4 blueprint for the Olympics which could have applicability into the next century, by developing a comprehensive intermodal plan including vertistops and <b>vertiports.</b> A second research project has been initiated with the US Department of the Army to develop a three-dimensional master plan, using S 4 principles, for Fort Lewis, Washington, including joint use, multiple use, and adaptive use of space, three-dimensionally. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{define and}} solve the {{problems}} of transportation in the California Corrider in the year 2010, the 1989 California Polytechnic State University Aeronautical Engineering Senior Design class determined future corridor transportation needs and developed a system to meet the requirements. A market study, which included interpreting travel demand and gauging the future of regional and national air travel {{in and out of the}} corridor, allowed the goals of the project to be accurately refined. Comprehensive trade-off studies of several proposed transporation systems were conducted to determine which components would form the final proposed system. Preliminary design and further analysis were performed for each resulting component. The proposed system consists of three vehicles and a special hub or mode mixer, the Corridor Access Port (CAP). The vehicles are: (1) an electric powered aircraft to serve secondary airports and the CAP; (2) a high speed magnetic levitation train running through the CAP and the high population density areas of the corridor; and (3) a vertical takeoff and landing tilt rotor aircraft to serve both intercity and intrametropolitan travelers from the CAP and city <b>vertiports.</b> The CAP is a combination and an extension of the hub, mode mixer, and Wayport concepts. The CAP is an integrated part of the system which meets the travel demands in the corridor, and interfaces with interstate and international travel...|$|R

Therefore, such a computer simulation code has been developed to size reaction driven stopped rotor/wing vehicles {{which may or may not}} enable Circulation Control. The difficulty in sizing such a concept is primarily due to the unique coupling of rotor and engine which need to be sized concurrently since they are directly linked to each other and cannot be studied in isolation. This coupling, in fact, is not seen in any other concept. The methodology and computer simulation tool presented in this paper show how this coupling is accomplished. Furthermore, the results from this rotor/engine coupling are presented in the form of Response Surface Equations that is derived through the application of Response Surface Methodology. These RSE's also provide the designer with a unique ability to predict what the response will be, based on the settings of the design variables that he/she chooses. The robustness advantages of using these RSE's are also presented in the vehicle sizing portion of the overall design methodology for the stopped rotor/wing configurations...|$|R
40|$|A {{fleet of}} civil tilt rotor {{transports}} offers {{a means of}} reducing airport congestion and point-to-point travel time. The speed, range, and fuel economy of these aircraft, along with their efficient use of <b>vertiport</b> area, make them good candidates for short-to-medium range civil transport. However, to be successfully integrated into the civilian community, the tilt rotor must {{be perceived as a}} quiet, safe, and economical mode of transportation that does not harm the environment. In particular, noise impact has been identified as a possible barrier to the civil tilt rotor. Along with rotor conversion-mode flight, and blade-vortex interaction noise during descent, hover mode is a noise problem for tilt rotor operations. In the present research, tilt rotor hover aeroacoustics have been studied analytically, experimentally, and computationally. Various papers on the subject were published as noted in the list of publications. More recently, experimental measurements were made on a 1 / 12. 5 scale model of the XV- 15 in hover and analyses of this data and extrapolations to full scale were also carried out. A dimensional analysis showed that the model was a good aeroacoustic approximation to the full-scale aircraft, and scale factors were derived to extrapolate the model measurements to the full-scale XV- 15. The experimental measurements included helium bubble flow visualization, silk tuft flow visualization, 2 -component hot wire anemometry, 7 -hole pressure probe measurements, vorticity measurements, and outdoor far field acoustic measurements. The hot wire measurements were used to estimate the turbulence statistics of the flow field into the rotors, such as length scales, velocity scales, dissipation, and turbulence intermittency. Several different configurations of the model were tested: (1) standard configurations (single isolated rotor, two rotors without the aircraft, standard tilt rotor configuration); (2) flow control devices (the 'plate', the 'diagonal fences'); (3) basic configuration changes (increasing the rotor/rotor spacing, reducing the rotor plane/wing clearance. operating the rotors out of phase). Also, an approximation to Sikorsky's Variable Diameter Tilt Rotor (VDTR) configuration was tested, and some flow measurements were made on a semi-span configuration of the model. Acoustic predictions were made using LOWSON. M, a Mathematica code Mean aerodynamic models were developed based on hover performance predictions from HOVER. FOR. This hover prediction code used blade element theory for the aerodynamics, and Prandtl's Vortex theory to model the wake, along with empirical formulas for the effects of Reynolds number, Mach number, and stall. Aerodynamic models were developed from 7 -hole pressure probe measurements of the mean velocity into the model rotors...|$|E

First, we introduce a methodology based on modified approximated cell-decomposition and Dijkstra's search algorithm to optimize longitudinal plane (2 -D) RIA trajectories over a cost function that minimizes noise, time, and fuel use. Then, we extend the trajectory optimization model to 3 -D with a k-ary tree as the discrete search space. We incorporate geography information system (GIS) data, specifically population, into our objective function, and focus on a practical case study: the design of SNI RIA approach procedures to Baltimore-Washington International airport. Because solutions were represented as trim state sequences, we incorporated smooth transition between segments to enable more realistic cost estimates. Due to the significant computational complexity, we investigated alternative more efficient optimization techniques applicable to our nonlinear, non-convex, heavily constrained, and discontinuous objective function. Comparing genetic algorithm (GA) and adaptive simulated annealing (ASA) with our original Dijkstra's algorithm, ASA is identified as the most efficient algorithm for terminal area trajectory optimization. The effects of design parameter discretization are analyzed, with results indicating a SNI procedure with 3 - 4 segments effectively balances simplicity with cost minimization. Finally, pilot control commands were implemented and generated via optimization-base inverse simulation to validate execution of the optimal approach trajectories...|$|R
