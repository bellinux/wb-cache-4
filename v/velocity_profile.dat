5|$|This {{problem was}} first {{addressed}} by C.R. Illingworth in 1950. In incompressible flow, the <b>velocity</b> <b>profile</b> is linear because the fluid temperature is constant. When {{the upper and}} lower walls are maintained at different temperatures, the <b>velocity</b> <b>profile</b> is complicated, but it turns out it has an exact implicit solution.|$|E
5|$|A {{constant}} stress layer {{exists in the}} near wall region. Due to the damping of the vertical velocity fluctuations near the wall, the Reynolds stress term will become negligible and we find that a linear <b>velocity</b> <b>profile</b> exists. This is only true for the very near wall region.|$|E
5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with model aircraft, it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same <b>velocity</b> <b>profile</b> which gives the laminar boundary layer its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in the pressure drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a turbulator. The fuller <b>velocity</b> <b>profile</b> of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation and skin friction from induced turbulence.|$|E

5|$|At high Reynolds numbers, {{typical of}} {{full-sized}} aircraft, {{it is desirable}} to have a laminar boundary layer. This results in a lower skin friction due to the characteristic <b>velocity</b> <b>profile</b> of laminar flow. However, the boundary layer inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as boundary layer transition. One {{way of dealing with}} this problem is to suck the boundary layer away through a porous surface (see Boundary layer suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural laminar flow techniques push the boundary layer transition aft by reshaping the aerofoil or fuselage so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} source of instability in a fluid {{is the presence of}} a velocity gradient or shear layer with an inflection point.

40|$|Francis- 99 is {{a series}} of {{upcoming}} workshops aimed at determining {{the state of the art}} of high head Francis turbine simulations. The scope of this essay is to provide empirical data to serve as validation for the CFD simulations. Axial and tangential <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles</b> were measured for a model of the Tokke runner while operating in part load, best efficiency, and full load, at two different locations in the draft tube cone: 64 mm and 382 mm below the draft tube inlet. The results were phase resolved in order to calculate normal Reynolds stresses at the different operating conditions, and the results have been compared with computer simulations. The resulting <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles</b> have been evaluated with respect to the governing equations, and the correlation between <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles,</b> pressure gradients and normal stresses has been discussed. The effect of head on the <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles</b> has been evaluated, and found to have only a small impact on the reduced <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles,</b> both axially and tangentially.

40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis {{deals with the}} analysis of the flow in the circular and not circular cross-section pipes by methods using the distribution of the vorticity density. This analysis is particularly focused on the derivation of the new <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles</b> formulas using the above mentioned method. In this work is presented a historical overview of the derived <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles.</b> This overview of already derived <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles</b> will be a fundamental benchmark for newly derived <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles.</b> These new <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles</b> are derived for the circular and not circular cross-section pipes and the derivation is based on the analogy of electromagnetic induction by using Biot-Savart law. It is necessary to apply this analogy at first on solitary vortex filament. By taking this step is possible to get the value of the induced velocity from one solitary vortex filament. Subsequently it is possible to obtain the value of the induced velocity from the vorticity wall and afterwards from the vorticity density distribution over the cross section. This work contains also the results of the experimental measurements of the <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles,</b> and of the CFD simulations. Experimentally measured results are used besides other for the selecting of the most suitable CFD computational model.

40|$|We perform {{molecular}} dynamics simulations of model granular systems undergoing boundary-driven planar shear flow in two spatial dimensions {{with the goal}} of developing a more complete understanding of how dense particulate systems respond to applied shear. In particular, we are interested in determining when these systems will possess linear <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles</b> and when they will develop highly localized <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles</b> in response to shear. In previous work on similar systems we showed that nonlinear <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles</b> form when the speed of the shearing boundary exceeds the speed of shear waves in the material. However, we find that nonlinear <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles</b> in these systems are unstable at very long times. The degree of nonlinearity slowly decreases in time; the <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles</b> become linear when the granular temperature and density profiles are uniform across the system at long times. We measure the time $t_l$ required for the <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles</b> to become linear and find that $t_l$ increases as a power-law with the speed of the shearing boundary and increases rapidly as the packing fraction approaches random close packing. We also performed simulations in which differences in the granular temperature across the system were maintained by vertically vibrating one of the boundaries during shear flow. We find that nonlinear <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles</b> form and are stable at long times if the difference in the granular temperature across the system exceeds a threshold value that is comparable to the glass transition temperature in an equilibrium system at the same average density. Finally, the sheared and vibrated systems form stable shear bands, or highly localized <b>velocity</b> <b>profiles,</b> when the applied shear stress is lowered below the yield stress of the static part of the system.
