50|$|A Belt dryer / Belt cooler is {{a device}} {{designed}} for the particularly gentle thermal treatment of product. The wet product is continuously and evenly applied through an infeed chamber onto a perforated belt. The belt, predominantly in horizontal position, carries the product through the drying area which is divided into several sections. In these cells drying gas flows through or over the wet product and dries it. Each cell can be equipped with a <b>ventilating</b> <b>fan</b> and a heat exchanger. This modular design allows the drying and cooling temperatures to be controlled separately in the different sections. Thus, each dryer cell can be individually controlled and the drying / cooling air flow can be varied in each cell. In addition, {{the speed of the}} conveyor belt can be varied what gives an additional parameter for setting of drying time.The cells can be heated or cooled directly or indirectly, and all heating media, such as oil, steam, hot water or hot gas can be used.Belt dryers are ideally suited to drying almost any non-flowing product or more granular products that require a lower throughput capacity.|$|E
5000|$|The Tungsten halogen curing light, {{also known}} as simply “halogen curing light” is the most {{frequent}} polymerization source used in dental offices. [...] In order for the light to be produced, an electric current flows through a thin tungsten filament, which functions as a resistor. [...] This resistor is then “heated to temperatures of about 3,000 Kelvin, it becomes incandescent and emits infrared and electromagnetic radiation {{in the form of}} visible light”. [...] It provides a blue light of about 400 and 500 nm, with an intensity of 400- 600 mW cm^-2. [...] This type of curing light however has certain drawbacks, the first of which is the high temperatures that the filament generates. This requires that the curing light have a <b>ventilating</b> <b>fan</b> installed in order to “force airflow through slots in the casing”. [...] This requires the curing light to be larger, in order to house the fan. The fan generates a sound that may disturb some patients, and the wattage of the bulb is such (e.g. 80W) these curing lights must be plugged into a power source, that is, they are not cordless. Furthermore, this light requires frequent monitoring and replacement of the actual curing light bulb because of the high temperatures that are reached. (For example, one model uses a bulb with an estimated life of 50 hours which would require annual replacement, assuming 12 minutes' use per day, 250 days per year.) Also, the time needed to fully cure the material is much more than the LED curing light.|$|E
40|$|The main {{noise source}} in heating, ventilation, and air {{conditioning}} systems is usually a <b>ventilating</b> <b>fan.</b> Noise, generated by the <b>ventilating</b> <b>fan</b> is transmitted through the duct into the living and working environment. A typical fan noise spectrum consists of a broadband noise, which is superimposed with pure tones. Different methods are available to reduce a transmission of such noise from the <b>ventilating</b> <b>fan</b> into the living and working environment. In this article it is demonstrated how a feedforward active noise control system can be implemented together with a side branch resonator. Effectiveness of the feedforward active noise control system depends {{on the quality of}} a reference signal, which should be in a perfect correlation with the primary noise. An acoustic feedback is the main problem of feedforward active noise control systems in ducts. A combined method uses a single loudspeaker to work as a dipole source and a side branch resonator to reduce the acoustic feedback. A side branch resonator reduces noise transmission in a narrowband frequency range as well. In this article, a theoretical background of a dipole source with a side branch resonator is presented, along with some measurement results and simulations of active noise control...|$|E
