25|$|In {{women with}} SS, <b>vaginal</b> <b>dryness,</b> vulvodynia and {{dyspareunia}} (painful sexual intercourse) are often reported; personal lubricants are recommended to help lessen irritation or pain {{that may result}} from dryness in the vaginal and vulva areas.|$|E
25|$|Dyspareunia may {{be caused}} by {{insufficient}} lubrication (<b>vaginal</b> <b>dryness)</b> in women. Poor lubrication may result from insufficient excitement and stimulation, or from hormonal changes caused by menopause, pregnancy, or breast-feeding.

40|$|Objectives: Women {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parts of the family and society, and community health is dependent on provision of the needs of this group. Menopause is one of the most critical stages of life among women. One of the aims of health services for all of the people in the 21 st century is improvement of the quality-of-life. In menopausal women, the term quality-of-life incorporates its physical symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats and <b>vaginal</b> mucosa <b>dryness.</b> We set out this study in order to evaluate the effect of education on the quality-of-life and the improvement of health standards in menopausal women. Materials and Methods: Sixty-two women aged 44 - 55 referring to and academic outpatient clinic in Shiraz were selected by simple random sampling, and allocated in two groups. Data was collected using a modified Hildich questionnaire on quality-of-life in menopause stage. Quality-of-life of the subjects (vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual aspects) were evaluated prior to and 3 months after educational intervention. Results: Mean quality-of-life score in study and control groups, prior to education, was 81. 7 and 74. 8; changing to 75. 3 and 75. 8, respectively three months after intervention. The study group showed a significant improvement in their quality-of-life (p = 0. 001). A significant difference was seen between groups in terms of changing quality-of-life after intervention (p = 0. 001).

25|$|Sjögren {{syndrome}} (SjS, SS) is {{a long-term}} autoimmune disease in which the moisture-producing glands of the body are affected. This results primarily {{in the development of}} a dry mouth and dry eyes. Other symptoms can include dry skin, a chronic cough, <b>vaginal</b> <b>dryness,</b> numbness in the arms and legs, feeling tired, muscle and joint pains, and thyroid problems. Those affected are at an increased risk (5%) of lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|After menopause, {{the body}} {{produces}} less estrogen, which causes the vaginal walls {{to thin out}} significantly. The effects of menopause can lead to <b>vaginal</b> <b>dryness</b> (due to a decrease in vaginal lubrication), which causes vaginal discomfort on its own or discomfort or pain during sexual intercourse. This can be alleviated with hormone replacement therapy, estrogen-containing vaginal creams, or non-prescription, non-hormonal products, but there are risks and adverse effects associated with hormone replacement therapy.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen {{and other}} hormones {{are given to}} {{postmenopausal}} women {{in order to prevent}} osteoporosis as well as treat the symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, <b>vaginal</b> <b>dryness,</b> urinary stress incontinence, chilly sensations, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, and sweating. Fractures of the spine, wrist, and hips decrease by 50–70% and spinal bone density increases by ~5% in those women treated with estrogen within 3 years of the onset of menopause and for 5–10 years thereafter.|$|E
40|$|Menopause is the {{permanent}} cessation of menstrual periods {{for at least}} 12 months. It generally occurs due to physiological changes in ageing ovaries at around 51 years of age, although it may occur in women as young as 40 years. Iatrogenic causes such as removal of the ovaries, chemotherapy, pelvic irradiation and certain medications may also trigger a &# 039;medical menopause&# 039;. The peri-menopausal period may last from six months to 10 years (average 3. 5 years) and symptoms may vary from nonexistent to severe. Typically periods will become more irregular with changes in frequency, duration or flow. These changes may also be accompanied by vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes, sweating), <b>vaginal</b> atrophy or <b>dryness,</b> loss of libido, mood changes, sleep disturbance, loss of concentration, fatigue and other symptoms that impair quality of life. Interventions that reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms and thus improve quality of life are thus highly sought after...|$|R
30|$|Well-characterised primary {{symptoms}} {{associated with}} the climacterium include hot flushes (HF), sweating, insomnia, nervousness and irritability, palpitations, changes in libido, dyspareunia, depression, musculoskeletal pain, <b>vaginal</b> pruritus and <b>dryness,</b> pain and/or inflammation, and increased bone turnover (Burger et al. 2002; Crandall et al. 2011). These symptoms vary in frequency and severity, and are presumed to be evoked by the physiological decrease in ovarian function as women transition from reproductive to post-reproductive life (Kronenberg 1990; Nakano et al. 2012; Crandall et al. 2011; Hunter et al. 2012). In other patients, the same symptoms {{may be caused by}} chemotherapy or surgery relating to breast cancer or other malignancies. The prevalence of the cardinal vasomotor symptoms, HF and night sweating, varies between 24 and 93 % in peri- and post-menopausal women (Kronenberg 1990; Nakano et al. 2012; Crandall et al. 2011; Hunter et al. 2012), and is observed in more than 65 % of breast cancer patients (Adelson et al. 2005). Patients with chemotherapy-induced ovarian insufficiency experience even more severe symptoms than patients undergoing normal ageing (Adelson et al. 2005; Carpenter et al. 1998), and the effect on the quality of life varies greatly among those affected.|$|R
40|$|Background: Atrophic {{vaginitis}} is a disease, {{which affects}} up to 50 % of postmenopausal women. This study compared the effectiveness and user-friendliness of Vagifem (an estradiol vaginal tablet) and vaginal estrogen cream {{in the treatment}} of atrophic vaginitis. Materials and Methods: One hundred and sixty postmenopausal women with symptoms of atrophic vaginitis were randomly divided into two groups of treatment with Vagifem or with vaginal estrogen cream for 12 weeks. Patients used the medication daily for the first 2 weeks of the study, and twice weekly. Severity of vaginal atrophy and four main symptoms of atrophic vaginitis including dysuria, dyspareunia, <b>vaginal</b> itching, and <b>dryness</b> were evaluated and compared before and after treatment. In addition, patients were asked regarding user-friendliness and hygienic issues of medications. Results: Both vaginal estrogen cream and Vagifem significantly improved symptoms of atrophic vaginitis but in terms of effectiveness for the treatment symptoms of atrophic vaginitis, {{there was no significant difference}} between the two medications. Vagifem compared to estrogen cream resulted in significantly lower rate of hygienic problems (0 % versus 23 %, P < 0. 001), and was reported by the patients as a significantly easier method of treatment (90 % versus 55 %, P < 0. 0001). Conclusion: This investigation showed that Vagifem is an appropriate medication for the treatment of atrophic vaginitis, which is as effective as vaginal estrogen creams and is more user-friendly...|$|R
25|$|Before menopause, a woman's periods {{typically}} become irregular, {{which means}} that periods may be longer or shorter in duration or be lighter or heavier {{in the amount of}} flow. During this time, women often experience hot flashes; these typically last from 30 seconds to ten minutes and may be associated with shivering, sweating, and reddening of the skin. Hot flashes often stop occurring after a year or two. Other symptoms may include <b>vaginal</b> <b>dryness,</b> trouble sleeping, and mood changes.|$|E
25|$|During perimenopause, {{estrogen}} levels {{average about}} 20–30% higher than during premenopause, often with wide fluctuations. These fluctuations cause {{many of the}} physical changes during perimenopause as well as menopause. Some of these changes are hot flashes, night sweats, difficulty sleeping, <b>vaginal</b> <b>dryness</b> or atrophy, incontinence, osteoporosis, and heart disease. During this period, fertility diminishes but is not considered to reach zero until the official date of menopause. The official date is determined retroactively, once 12 months have passed after the last appearance of menstrual blood.|$|E
25|$|Estrogens are {{responsible}} for the maintenance of collagen, elastic fibers, and vasoculature of the urogenital tract, all of which are important in maintaining vaginal structure and functional integrity; they are also important for maintaining vaginal pH and moisture levels, both of which aid in keeping the tissues lubricated and protected. Prolonged estrogen deficiency leads to atrophy, fibrosis, and reduced blood flow to the urogenital tract, which is what causes menopausal symptoms such as <b>vaginal</b> <b>dryness</b> and pain related to sexual activity and/or intercourse. It has been consistently demonstrated that women with lower sexual functioning have lower estradiol levels.|$|E
40|$|Urogenital {{problems}} in the elderly female population are experienced by one third of women from the age 50 years and onward. Symptoms from the lower urinary tract include incontinence, urethritis, and recurrent urinary tract infections. Atrophic changes within the bladder neck and urethra could be corrected by estrogen administration even at doses so low that endometrial proliferation is avoided. Hence such estrogens could be given without progestogen comedication. Control of micturition is a complex process of which estrogen deficiency {{is only one of}} several factors. The aging process with subsequent changes in membrane permeability, neuromuscular function, and collagen synthesis contributes to the local problems of control of micturition. In addition, the central control may also be affected by degenerative changes of the nervous system. <b>Vaginal</b> symptoms comprise <b>dryness</b> of vagina, dyspareunia, and recurrent vaginitis often followed by a foul odor and discharge. The microflora with lactobacilli and low pH as seen in fertile women is gradually replaced by a mixed germ flora including several of the pathogenic organisms common in urinary tract infections. Vaginal pH increases from around 4 to between 6 and 7. It is a puzzling fact that the urogenital tissues seem to be more "sensitive" to estrogens than other tissues. Conformational changes of the estrogen receptor(s) brought about by the local cytokine milieu is one possibility to explain the situation. The systemic absorption of low-dose estrogen preparations is dependent on the status of the vaginal mucosa. Absorption is high when the vaginal mucosa is atrophic and gradually decreases (but not to zero) as the vaginal mucosa matures under estrogen influence...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: Following hot flashes, the second, {{most common}} and bothersome menopausal {{complaint}} is vaginal atrophy. This symptoms causes <b>vaginal</b> or vulvar <b>dryness,</b> dyspareunia, vaginismus or itching that can significantly affect quality of life. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the effectiveness of vaginal perssaried containing sodium hyaloronate or vitamin E for the treatment of atrophic vaginitis. Subjects and Methods: This randomized, double-blind clinical trial study was carried out at 17 Shahrivar health center (an educational center in Ahvaz, Iran) from August to December 2010. Forty postmenopausal women with symptoms of vaginal atrophy were randomized in two groups to administer vaginal perssaries of 5 mg sodium hyaloronate (n= 20) or 1 mg vitamin E (n= 20) for 8 weeks. Vaginal maturation was measured and compared in both groups. The data were analyzed using independent t-test and Paired t test, in SPSS version 16. 0. P-values less than 0. 05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The results showed that the vaginal maturation values were significantly improved at both treatment groups (P< 0. 001). However, the mean maturation value in sodium hyaluronate group was significantly higher when compared with vitamin E group (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Sodium hyaluronate and vitamin E increased maturation of vaginal epithelium, but improvement was greater in sodium hyaluronate group. Therefore, sodium hyaluronate vaginal pessary is suggested as an ulternative in women who do not want to or cannot use estrogen treatment of vaginal atrophy. ►Please cite this paper as: Ziagham S, Abbaspoor Z, Abbaspour MR, Haghighizadeh M h, Rashidi I.

40|$|Objective. There is no {{effective}} treatment {{for patients with}} primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Since tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) could be {{a key element in}} the pathogenesis of primary SS, we conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effect of infliximab in primary SS. Methods. A total of 103 patients with primary SS were randomly assigned to receive infliximab infusions (5 mg/kg) or placebo at weeks 0, 2, and 6 and were followed up for 22 weeks. All patients fulfilled the new American-European Consensus Group criteria for SS and had active disease as assessed by values > 50 mm on 2 of 3 visual analog scales (VAS) (0 - 100 mm) that evaluated joint pain, fatigue, and buccal, ocular, skin, <b>vaginal,</b> or bronchial <b>dryness.</b> A favorable overall response was defined as the patient having ≥ 30 % improvement between weeks 0 and 10 in the values on 2 of the 3 VAS. Secondary end points were values on each VAS separately, the number of tender and swollen joints, the basal salivary flow rate, results of the Schirmer test for lacrimal gland function, the focus score on labial salivary gland biopsy, the level of C-reactive protein, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate evaluated at weeks 0, 10, and 22, as well as quality of life evaluated by use of the generic Short Form 36 questionnaire administered at weeks 0, 10, and 22. Results. At week 10, 26. 5 % of patients receiving placebo and 27. 8 % of patients treated with infliximab had a favorable overall response (P = 0. 89), and at week 22, 20. 4 % of the placebo group and 16. 7 % of the infliximab group had a favorable response (P = 0. 62). In addition, the 2 groups did not differ in any of the secondary end points over the 22 weeks of the trial. Severe adverse events reported in the infliximab group did not differ from those observed in previous studies. Conclusion. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of an anti-TNF agent did not show any evidence of efficacy of infliximab in primary SS. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

25|$|Menopause is the {{permanent}} cessation of menstruation resulting from loss of ovarian follicular activity. Menopause {{can be divided}} into early and late transition periods, also known as perimenopause and postmenopause. Each stage is marked by changes in hormonal patterns, which can induce menopausal symptoms. It is possible to induce menopause prematurely by surgically removing the ovary or ovaries (oophorectomy). This is often done as a consequence of ovarian failure, such as ovarian or uterine cancers. The most common side effects of the menopausal transition are: lack of sexual desire or libido, lack of sexual arousal, and <b>vaginal</b> <b>dryness.</b> The modification of women’s physiology can lead to changes in her sexual response, the development of sexual dysfunctions, and changes in her levels of sexual desire.|$|E

40|$|Extent: 100 p. BACKGROUND Menopause {{can be a}} {{distressing}} {{and disruptive}} time for many women, with many experiencing hot flushes, night sweats, <b>vaginal</b> atrophy and <b>dryness.</b> Postmenopausal women are also at increased risk of osteoporosis. Interventions that decrease the severity and frequency of these menopausal symptoms are likely to improve a woman's well-being and quality of life. Hormone therapy {{has been shown to}} be effective in controlling the symptoms of menopause; however, many potentially serious adverse effects have been associated with this treatment. Evidence from experimental studies suggests that black cohosh may be a biologically plausible alternative treatment for menopause; even so, findings from studies investigating the clinical effectiveness of black cohosh have, to date, been inconsistent. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa or Actaea racemosa) for treating menopausal symptoms in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. SEARCH METHODS Relevant studies were identified through AARP Ageline, AMED, AMI, BioMed Central gateway, CAM on PubMed, CINAHL, CENTRAL, EMBASE, Health Source Nursing/Academic edition, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, MEDLINE, Natural medicines comprehensive database, PsycINFO, TRIP database, clinical trial registers and the reference lists of included trials; up to March 2012. Content experts and manufacturers of black cohosh extracts were also contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA All randomised controlled trials comparing orally administered monopreparations of black cohosh to placebo or active medication in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data and completed the 'Risk of bias' assessment. Study authors were contacted for missing information. MAIN RESULTS Sixteen randomised controlled trials, recruiting a total of 2027 perimenopausal or postmenopausal women, were identified. All studies used oral monopreparations of black cohosh at a median daily dose of 40 mg, for a mean duration of 23 weeks. Comparator interventions included placebo, hormone therapy, red clover and fluoxetine. Reported outcomes included vasomotor symptoms, vulvovaginal symptoms, menopausal symptom scores and adverse effects. There was no significant difference between black cohosh and placebo in the frequency of hot flushes (mean difference (MD) 0. 07 flushes per day; 95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 43 to 0. 56 flushes per day; P= 0. 79; 393 women; three trials; moderate heterogeneity: I 2 = 47 %) or in menopausal symptom scores (standardised mean difference (SMD) - 0. 10; 95 % CI - 0. 32 to 0. 11; P = 0. 34; 357 women; four trials; low heterogeneity: I 2 = 21 %). Compared to black cohosh, hormone therapy significantly reduced daily hot flush frequency (three trials; data not pooled) and menopausal symptom scores (SMD 0. 32; 95 % CI 0. 13 to 0. 51; P= 0. 0009; 468 women; five trials; substantial heterogeneity: I 2 = 69 %). These findings should be interpreted with caution given the heterogeneity between studies. Comparisons of the effectiveness of black cohosh and other interventions were either inconclusive (because of considerable heterogeneity or an insufficient number of studies) or not statistically significant. Similarly, evidence on the safety of black cohosh was inconclusive, owing to poor reporting. There were insufficient data to pool results for health-related quality of life, sexuality, bone health, vulvovaginal atrophic symptoms and night sweats. No trials reported cost-effectiveness data. The quality of included trials was generally unclear, owing to inadequate reporting. AUTHOR'S CONCLUSIONS There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of black cohosh for menopausal symptoms. Ho wever, there is adequate justification for conducting further studies in this area.

25|$|The {{maintenance}} and {{improvement of quality}} of life during the menopausal period {{is at the core}} of estrogen and progestin-based hormone therapy. Both HRT and estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) have been shown to enhance sexual desire in a significant percent of women; however, as with all pharmacological treatments, not all women have been responsive, especially those with preexisting sexual difficulties. ERT restores vaginal cells, pH levels, and blood flow to the vagina, all of which deterioration are associated with the onset of menopause. Dyspareunia (due to <b>vaginal</b> <b>dryness)</b> appears to be the most responsive component of menopausal women’s sexuality to ERT. It also has been shown to have positive effects on the urinary tract and atrophy and may initially improve libido or sexual sensitivity. Other improvements in areas such as sexual desire, arousal, fantasies, and frequency of coitus and orgasm have also been noted. However, the effectiveness of ERT has been shown to decline in some women after long-term use. A number of studies have found that the combined effects of estrogen/androgen replacement therapy can increase a woman’s motivational aspects of sexual behaviour over and above what can be achieved with estrogen therapy alone. Findings on a relatively new form of HRT called tibolone— a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic properties— suggest that it has the ability to improve mood, libido, and somatic symptoms of surgically menopausal women to a greater degree than ERT. In various placebo-controlled studies, improvements in vasomotor symptoms, emotional reactions, sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, and sexual desire have been observed. However, while this is and has been available in Europe for almost two decades, this has not been approved for use in North America at this point.|$|E
