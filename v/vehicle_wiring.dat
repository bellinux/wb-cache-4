These include high-wattage lamps, and those that emit light of a colour outside the white or selective yellow specification ranges. Such lamps are illegal throughout the industrialised world for use in regulated automotive lighting devices, and so <b>vehicle</b> <b>wiring,</b> switches, and lighting components are generally not designed or built to withstand the higher heat and power consumption from off-spec lamps. Lamps with higher-than-specified output can also create unsafe levels of glare. There is considerable variability by jurisdiction in the regulation of off-road applications of lamp types used in on-road vehicles.|$|E
50|$|The {{tampering}} {{became so}} {{widespread in the}} 1990s that the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) required delay box manufacturers to make the delay boxes harder to modify by end users, and shrink enclosures {{so there was no}} room for additional contents. Sealing the delay box enclosure so it would be easy to see if it was tampered with was also part of the process. The NHRA also created rules specifying how a drag racer electrically wired his race car, requiring racers to leave wires unbundled so they could be quickly and easily traced by eye. Rules were also created limiting how many interconnects could attach to the wire between the delay box and the transmission. NHRA track officials were empowered to inspect the wiring to insure it met with the new rules. The NHRA also began requiring delay box manufacturers to pay a fee and submit delay box designs for the NHRA's approval. Then the NHRA instituted rules which allowed only NHRA approved delay boxes at its race tracks. This included revealing trade secrets to the NHRA, while the NHRA refused to enter into Non-Disclosure Agreements with the delay box manufacturers. Once submitted for NHRA approval, and paying the fee, delay box manufactures were not allowed to make any changes in design for any reason without resubmitting to the NHRA for re-approval and paying another fee. To obtain the NHRA's approval, delay box manufacturers had to accommodate the NHRA by making any design changes the NHRA mandated. Essentially the NHRA was now designing delay boxes by proxy. Furthermore, drag racers were prevented from using any delay box they made themselves at home. This is changed the face of drag racing in a huge way. Traditionally, grass roots drag racing was where racers could build their own chassis, engine, transmission, differential, vehicle plumbing & <b>vehicle</b> <b>wiring,</b> etc. Skilled racers could build their own race car with their own hands from parts wherever they acquired them. Racers were not required to buy anything pre-made if they didn't want to. Those days became history almost overnight. Virtually any racer innovation (electronic or mechanical) now came into question and could cause disqualification. An NHRA track could deny the ability to race at their track if they saw something homemade on a race car. The path to racing with the least worry about being disqualified was to buy everything for the car from approved NHRA manufacturers (other sanctioning bodies quickly followed suit, such as the IHRA, NMCA, and others).|$|E

40|$|As {{the cost}} of {{wireless}} devices approaches zero, it becomes more feasible to replace wires with wireless communication. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>wiring</b> harnesses are traditionally wired to communicate both power and information simultaneously, resulting in separate circuits for each vehicle device. X-By-Wireless seeks to supplant this configuration {{in favor of a}} shared power bus and wireless inter-component communication. In doing so, we can recognize a number of benefits such as reduced weight and increased reliability, flexibility, and upgradeability. However, this introduces new problems such as longer transmission delays, interference and encryption issues, fusing difficulties, and public perception regarding safety. The purpose of this thesis is to define the X-By-Wireless concept and to investigate the benefits and drawbacks in implementing X-By-Wireless. Furthermore, we do a theoretical and case study analysis to expand upon the weight reduction benefit so as to quantify the expected improvements. We also address each of the challenges presented by X-By-Wireless and integrate them into a proposed circuit that is capable of performing all the necessary functions of wireless control, wireless sensing, and fusing. We find that the proposed device can be mass-produced as an effective solution that meets the speed and security constraints necessary for most vehicle components...|$|E

Organisations with histories of good industrial relations found that they were forced to layoff staff and, in the midst of these redundancies, found that goodwill and trust with employees and unions disappeared. This paper examines one Australian Company that was forced to reduce its staff from 971 to 588 and examines the way in which this was done so that trust and goodwill with employees and the trade unions was maintained. From this, using the model designed by Kuhn as a tool, the author examines the implications this has for personnel management in general as we head for the turn of the twenty-first century.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Energy {{harvesting}} is an emerging technological field, aiming, among others, to harvest kinetic energy from mechanical oscillations and converting {{the same to}} useful electrical energy. Usually, the reclaimed energy is quite small, acquired by lightweight devices which can be positioned in confined spaces and do not significantly add to the system mass and inertia. This potential use {{is in line with}} the vehicular powertrain development principle of high output power- to-light weight ratio as this concept has progressively led to increasing vibratory energy. These devices would potentially supply a few mW of power, which can typically power automotive sensors, potentially reducing the ever-increasing <b>vehicle</b> <b>wiring</b> network. A multitude of such devices positioned strategically can recover some of the vibratory energy of a plethora of vibration phenomena. The paper outlines some of these phenomena and proposes the use of a magnetic translational harvester. A preliminary study based on an experimental set up and a devised non-linear model show good potential across a range of frequencies, typical of engine order vibration at engine idling condition. However, the potential exists for both the optimisation of the demonstrated observer and increased energy recovery for suitable location(s) in the powertrain system...|$|E
40|$|The {{large number}} of <b>vehicle</b> <b>wiring</b> harness {{variants}} during the design phase generates considerable complexity, which needs to be managed at the production level. The wiring harness design is usually optimized at the product level to minimize product costs. Issues related to the manufacturing processes are not considered. The aim {{of this research is}} to develop a cost model which includes product and manufacturing costs to define an optimum level between product variant complexity and material costs (with the focus on wiring harness complexity). The cost model consists of two parts, (i) the product cost and (ii) the manufacturing cost. Unlike product cost, which is relatively easy to obtain, the methodology for evaluating the manufacturing cost requires an in-depth analysis, which is done in this research. The trade-off cost model is first applied to a case study based on real production data to evaluate the potential benefits. Then, a MATLAB simulation is developed to simulate a new scenario for managing wiring harness complexity. The results showed that cost savings can be achieved by applying a trade-off strategy between the product cost and manufacturing cost dynamically according to the forecast data. The limitation of this research is using fixed manufacturing costs in the case study and the MATLAB simulation. For practical applications, the manufacturing cost should be a function of number of individual part numbers in the plant. The concepts and methodology developed in this research could be used not only on automotive wiring harnesses, but also on parts and materials which are expensive and have many variants that need to be managed during production...|$|E

(Electrical And Electronic Engineering) In-vehicle Power Line Communication (PLC) is an {{emerging}} technology {{that can easily}} bene t the automotive industry by {{reducing the amount of}} wires (and hence cost, weight and complexity) for <b>vehicle</b> <b>wire</b> harnesses. The reduction in weight would also lead to less fuel consumption. This dissertation aims at taking the research of this technology a step towards fully understanding the vehicle's power line as a communication medium. We investigate the bit error characteristics of a readily available transceiver on the vehicle's power bus. To do so, we develop and perform bit error recording over the medium to get experimental results with the battery line under di ferent operating conditions. Using the rst set of these results, we parametrise di erent kinds of Markov models to see which one simulates the channel best. Using the preferred model, we then model the rest of the sets of results so that we can simulate the channel's bit error characteristics under these di erent conditions. Using these models, we demonstrate how these simulations can be used to evaluate the performance of di erent error detection and correction techniques. In particular, we evaluate the error detection mechanisms used in the popular in-vehicle Local Intercon- nect Network (LIN) protocol, in addition to some simple error correction techniques...|$|R

40|$|Much {{functionality}} of today's vehicles runs as {{software on}} embedded computer systems. This includes, for example, automatic climate control and engine control. As the processors necessarily {{are located in}} diffent physical locations inside the <b>vehicle</b> <b>wires</b> must be drawn between processors that need to communicate. Therefore, it is typical to have one or several buses connecting the processors in an embedded computer network, thus creating a distributed system. As {{some parts of the}} system in the car have real-time properties, it is necessary to validate that the real-time properties are upheld in the distributed system. This thesis presents the design and implementation of an adaptive cruise controller (ACC), which is a cruise controller that also keeps a minimum distance to the closest vehicle in front. Further, the performance of the ACC has been evaluated using an existing system-level simulator for distributed real-time systems together with metrics for Quality-of-Control (QoC). The ACC has then been simulated under different scenarios. The scenarios include outside conditions, for example the slope of the road, the behaviour of the vehicle in front, and the desired velocity, as well as internal conditions as adding different amounts of extra load on the processors and the bus. The results show that the functionality of the ACC starts deteriorating when the extra load on the nodes reaches high levels. When the extra load reaches very high levels, the ACC stops functioning completely. The results also show that the extra load on the bus has very little effect on the performance of the ACC...|$|R
