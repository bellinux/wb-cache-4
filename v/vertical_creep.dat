The bridge is a simple span, single-lane, stress-laminated deck superstructure that is approximately 26 -ft long and 16 -ft wide. The bridge is unique {{in that it is}} the first known stress-laminated timber bridge to be constructed of hardwood lumber. The performance of the bridge was monitored con-tinuously for approximately 4 years, beginning at the time of installation.

40|$|An {{incremental}} {{format of}} creep model {{was presented to}} take account of the development of concrete creep due to loading at different ages. The formulation was attained by introducing a horizontal parallel assumption of creep curves and combining it with the <b>vertical</b> parallel <b>creep</b> curve of the rate of creep method to remedy the disadvantage of the rate of creep method that significantly underestimates the amount of creep strain, regardless of its simple format. Two creep curves were combined by introducing an ageing parameter whose value was obtained from two sets of time-dependent laboratory experiments on cylindrical specimens. The presented creep description takes the advantage that a single creep curve due to the initial loading describes the entire development of creep under the persistent change of creep-causing stress. Further, the creep formulation takes advantage of being consistent with the incremental format of age-dependent constitutive formulation. The performance of the presented creep equation was investigated with time-dependent laboratory experiments on cylindrical specimens and compared with the performances of four existing creep models...|$|R
40|$|The Birchlog Run and Tumbling Rock Run bridges were {{constructed}} {{in the summer of}} 1990 on the Monongahela Na-tional Forest in West Virginia. The bridges are simple span, single-lane, stress-laminated deck superstructures, and each bridge is approximately 30 ft long and 13 ft wide. The bridges are located approximately 1 / 2 mile apart and are nearly identical in design. However, the Birchlog Run bridge is constructed of Southern Pine (softwood) lumber, and the Tumbling Rock Run bridge is constructed of Northern Red Oak (hardwood) lumber. The close proximity of the bridges provided an opportunity to compare the performance of stress-laminated decks constructed of softwood and hardwood species under similar environmental conditions. Performance of the bridges was monitored for 3 years, beginning at the time of installation. This monitoring involved gathering and analyzing data relative to the wood moisture content, force level of the stressing bars, <b>vertical</b> bridge <b>creep,</b> and behavior of the bridges under static-load conditions.

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{compressive}} behaviour aspects {{connected to the}} application of the bed joints reinforcement technique performed with CFRP (carbon fibre reinforced polymer) thin strips. The intervention technique can be particularly suitable in counteracting the typical damaging phenomenon of massive brick masonry structures, which is denoted by diffused thin <b>vertical</b> cracks (<b>creep</b> behaviour). The intervention consists in embedding the strips into pre-grooved mortar joints, and repointing them with a suitable hydraulic lime based mortar. Experimental laboratory tests were carried out on selected materials constituting the wall samples (solid clay bricks and lime-based mortars) and the reinforcing materials. In particular, according to the requirements of durability, compatibility, low obtrusiveness, and structural performance optimization, a hydraulic lime-based mortar as embedding product and a flexible CFRP thin strip, having a rectangular cross section 5 × 1. 5 mm, were used. In the paper, the results obtained by monotonic compression tests on brick masonry panels in plain, strengthened and repaired conditions after pre-damage are compared. Moreover, the main results of a series of laboratory pseudo-creep compression tests carried out on brick masonry panels strengthened with CFRP thin strips are presented and compared with those obtained from standard compression tests...|$|R
5000|$|The Shinn Covered Bridge is a {{historic}} wooden covered bridge in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Ohio. Located in the countryside northeast of Bartlett in Washington County, this single-span truss bridge was built in 1886 by local carpenter Charles T. Shinn. [...] Built of weatherboarded walls with stone abutments and a metal roof, the bridge features vertical siding, and its portals have remained <b>vertical</b> and resisted <b>creeping</b> into another shape. The heart of the bridge's structure employs the Burr Truss design, which mixes the king post truss with a wooden arch designed by Andrea Palladio in the sixteenth century. Shinn built his bridge to span the western branch of Wolf Creek in Palmer Township. [...] Measuring 98 ft in length, the bridge was constructed soon after the drowning of one of Shinn's children.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} involved creep {{and moisture}} movement measurements {{for about six}} months on 13 -course clay (Engineering class B) and calcium silicate brickwork, and 5 -course concrete blockwork, consecutively. Four different geometries of masonry were built, namely: single-leaf wall, cavity wall, hollow pier and solid pier, respectively having volume/surface area (V/S) ratios of 44, 51, 78 and 112 mm. Deformations were also measured on one-brick wide 5 or 6 -stack high model brickwalls which were partly sealed to simulate the V/S ratios of the corresponding 13 -course brickwork. At the same time, deformations were also measured on individual mortar prisms and brick or block units in order to verify composite model expressions for predicting masonry movements. Simulation of moisture diffusion of the corresponding mortarjoints and embedded bricks or block were made in terms of V/S ratio by partial sealing of the individual mortar prisms and brick or block units. The tests reveal that the modulus of elasticity to be independent of masonry geometry. However, there is a clear influence of geometry on the <b>vertical</b> ultimate <b>creep</b> and moisture movement of all the masonry types i,. e. creep and shrinkage increase with a decrease of V/S ratio. A similar trend occurs for horizontal shrinkage except for the clay brickwork which undergoes moisture expansion. Deformations of the model walls show reasonable agreement with the 13 -course brickwork. When results of individual mortar and brick/block specimens are inserted in composite models,the predicted strains show good agreement with the measured strains, particularly in the vertical direction. There is no consistent pattern in the distribution of load and moisture strains for the different masonry geometries, and the measurements reveal that actual strains can be up to 100...|$|R
40|$|The Brawley {{fault zone}} (bfz) and the Brawley Seismic Zone {{constitute}} the principal transfer zone accommodating strain between the San Andreas and Imperial faults in southernmost California. The bfz ruptured {{along with the}} Imperial fault in the 1940 M_w 6. 9 and the 1979 M_w 6. 4 earthquakes, although in each case only minor slip apparently occurred on the bfz; several other episodes of slip and creep have been documented on the bfz historically. Until this study, it has been unclear whether {{the past few decades}} reflect average behavior of the fault. Two trenches were opened and a series of auger holes were bored across three strands of the bfz at Harris Road to compare the amount of slip observed historically with the displacements observed in the paleoseismic record. Evidence is presented, across the westernmost strand of the bfz and across the entire bfz at Harris Road, to show that both the average vertical slip rate observed in modern times (since 1970) and the <b>vertical</b> <b>creep</b> rate (excluding coseismic slip) observed during the 1970 s are significantly higher than the long-term average. Across the westernmost strand, the long- term vertical rate is 1. 2 (+ 1. 5 /− 0. 5) mm/yr, and the average rate since about a. d. 1710 is determined to be no greater than 2. 0 mm/yr; in contrast, the average vertical rate between 1970 and 2004 across that strand was at least 4. 3 mm/yr, and the 1970 s vertical aseismic creep rate was 10 mm/yr. Likewise, across the entire bfz, the long- term vertical rate is 2. 8 (+ 4. 1 /− 1. 4) mm/yr, whereas the rate between 1970 and 2004 was at least 7. 2 mm/yr, and the 1970 s aseismic creep rate was 10 mm/yr. The long-term strike-slip rate cannot be determined across any strands of the bfz but may be significant. In contrast to the commonly accepted higher sedimentation rates inferred for the entire Imperial Valley, we find that the average sedimentation rate on the downthrown side of the bfz adjacent to Mesquite Basin, in the millennium preceding the onset of agricultural influences, was at most 3. 5 mm/yr. Finally, a creep event occurred on the bfz during our study in 2002 and is documented herein...|$|E

40|$|While {{it is well}} {{established}} that vibro stone columns reduce primary settlement and improve bearing capacity, their effect on creep compression has largely been overlooked to date. However, with increasing pressure to develop marginal sites underlain by soft organic soils, the effect of ground treatment on creep is an important emerging issue in geotechnical engineering. In this paper, a series of axisymmetric unit cell analyses {{have been carried out}} using the PLAXIS 2 D finite element program in conjunction with the Soft Soil Creep (SSC) model. Examination of the evolution of settlement improvement factor with time has indicated that the presence of creep leads to a lower âtotalâ improvement factor than would be obtained for primary consolidation settlement alone. Separate âprimaryâ and âcreepâ improvement factors have also been derived; the latter are much lower than the former, but are nevertheless greater than unity. Creep results in a stress transfer process; as the soil <b>creeps,</b> <b>vertical</b> stress is transferred from the soil to the stone column. The additional load carried by the column induces additional yielding and shear-plane formation in closely-spaced columns. The additional increment of stress transferred to the already yielded column reduces its efficacy.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present and}} {{demonstrate}} {{the application of}} a systematic methodology for predicting fire spread and growth and for a relative fire hazard classification of materials for any scale and fire environment. This methodol-ogy consists of three steps: (1) select laboratory test methods to perform flam-mability measurements; (2) based on these measurements, obtain key flamma-bility material properties which are precisely defined in this work; and (3) use these properties in a mathematical model of fire spread and growth to predict fire hazards. The complementary test methods we have selected and used are: (a) a general flammability test apparatus (such as NIST or FMRC) [1, 2] modified to also provide pyrolysis measurements in an inert N 2 atmosphere; (b) the Limited Oxygen Index (LOI) apparatus, which is used here as a tool for ob-taining properties needed for creeping flame spread and extinction, including vitiated environments; and (c) a solid material smoke-point height apparatus [8], which is used to characterize the smokiness of the burning material needed to determine the radiation and smoke yield for arbitrary fire situations (wall fires, pool fires or ceiling fires) [8]. The use and proper interpretation of the Limited Oxygen Index apparatus can replace the LIFT [10] apparatus for deter-mining in a more accurate and direct way the material properties required for <b>creeping</b> (<b>vertical</b> downward, lateral, horizontal) flame spread. The present methodology has been compared well with experiments in this work and else-where [9], and it has been used to predict critical conditions for fire spread [11], not empirically as it is usually done, but based on first principles of fire spread, fire growth and burning, together with material flammability properties syste-matically deduced from small-scale test measurements...|$|R
40|$|The use of glued {{laminated}} timber (glulam) in {{building and construction}} provides a designer with an attractive, environmentally friendly alternative to steel and concrete. However, along with other engineering materials, glulam is subject to creep {{and in order to}} use it efficiently without the risk of unacceptable long-term deflections occurring, a reliable method of estimating creep in glulam is desirable. With this mind, the Structural Timber Research Unit (STRU) at the University of Brighton embarked, in 1988, on an extensive glulam research programme. Since then, the deflection of prepared glulam specimens has been measured in the laboratory under controlled conditions and in 1992, the programme was broadened to include measurements to determine the behaviour of glulam in full-scale structures. A number of test sites have been established in a variety of buildings and the method chosen to monitor glulam beams in these is theodolite intersection using a Leica Electronic Coordinate Determination System (ECDS 3). Borrowed from industrial and engineering surveying, the use of the theodolite intersection technique to monitor glulam is unique and it has, despite the practical difficulties and size of structure involved, enabled the movement of beams to be monitored with an accuracy of 0. 1 mm. By processing three-dimensional intersection coordinates, <b>vertical</b> deflections and <b>creep</b> have been determined and results show that the creep response of the glulam beams monitored in full-scale structures can be represented by a seasonally modulated exponential function. This correlates well to results from the laboratory tests and demonstrates that measurements taken in the laboratory can predict the behaviour of glulam in-situ. The creep factors obtained also agree well with the values given for these in Eurocode 5 : Design of Timber Structures...|$|R
40|$|Carbonate {{reservoir}} rocks {{contain more}} than 60 % of the world’s oil reserves and 40 % of its gas reserves. The {{evolution of the}} reservoir quality, i. e. their porosity and permeability, is for a large part controlled by compaction due to pressure solution (chemical compaction). Pressure solution also forms an efficient mechanism of fault sealing in carbonate rocks. Moreover, during hydrocarbons production, and after injection of CO 2 into carbonate reservoirs, pressure solution may lead to <b>vertical</b> compaction <b>creep</b> and surface subsidence. Quantifying pressure solution compaction in carbonate rocks is therefore a subject of substantial practical and economic importance for hydrocarbons exploration and production, and for assessing the safety of geological storage of CO 2 in depleted carbonate reservoirs. This thesis reports {{the results of an}} experimental study of pressure solution compaction of granular calcite aggregates under hydrocarbon reservoir conditions. The aims were to verify the operation of pressure solution by reproducing pressure solution microstructures, {{to determine the effects of}} variables such as stress, temperature, grain size, pore fluid chemistry and fluid flow on the rate of the process, and to reveal and quantify the rate limiting mechanism of pressure solution. An experimental procedure was developed to isolate pressure solution from mechanical compaction, by applying pre-compaction at lab dry samples. No or minor creep could be measured in the pre-compacted samples when reloaded with pore fluid of various hydrocarbons. The pressure solution creep tests were performed on dry pre-compacted samples with pore fluids of CaCO 3 saturated solution. Fine-grained calcite or natural carbonate materials were used and the experimental conditions either at room temperature and 1 - 4 MPa applied stress or at 150 ºC and effective stresses of 20 - 47 MPa. Typical microstructures for intergranular pressure solution were reproduced. These consisted of indented and sutured grain contacts, over growths, and dissolution pits and precipitated layers developed on reference crystal surfaces inserted into the granular samples. Compaction creep rates were found to be always inversely proportional to grain size and increase with increasing of effective stresses. Temperature had only a minor positive effect on compaction rates in the temperature range up to 150 ºC. Pore fluid salinity ranging from 0. 1 - 0. 5 M NaCl increased the pressure solution compaction rate. Addition of common impurity ions of Mg 2 + and phosphate seen in formation water and seawater to the pore fluids drastically slowed down the compaction creep. Purer calcite samples achieved much larger strains than impure limestone samples. Flow-through promoted creep rates at larger strains (> 5 %) while no effects on strain rates occurred at lower strains. Measurements of the Ca 2 + concentration from compacting samples in intermittent flow-through runs revealed a build up to high super-saturations of CaCO 3 during compaction, notably at high strains. Evidence showed that pressure solution is the dominant mechanism for compaction creep and diffusion along grain boundary is the rate limiting step at low strains becoming precipitation controlled at higher strains (> 5 - 7 %). The experimentally derived values of the diffusion product DS (diffusion coefficient times effective thickness of water film) for IPS in calcite at low strain is between 2. 98  10 - 18 to 3. 73  10 - 19 m 3 /s at 150 C. As impurity ions like Mg 2 + and HPO 42 - can drastically slow down IPS due to the effect on the precipitation reaction, it is likely that IPS in calcite in nature is much slower than seen in Lab experiments on pure systems...|$|R
40|$|Vibro-replacement stone columns {{are widely}} used in {{geotechnical}} practice to improve the bearing capacity and settlement characteristics of weak natural soils and man-made fills, accelerate consolidation in fine soils and reduce soil liquefaction potential. The vibro-replacement technique is becoming increasingly popular {{for the treatment of}} soft cohesive (and often organic) soil deposits in which creep settlements can make up a significant proportion of the total settlement. The majority of field trials, numerical studies, and laboratory tests carried out to date have focused on estimating the improvement to bearing capacity or the reduction in settlement (almost exclusively primary settlement), with very little consideration given to the potential of stone columns to arrest long-term creep settlements. This research addresses this gap in knowledge by using two-dimensional finite element analysis techniques to assess the effectiveness of using vibro-replacement stone columns to treat creep-prone soils. The majority of the numerical modelling work described in this thesis is based on axisymmetric unit cell models, implemented using PLAXIS 2 D, using the Soft Soil Creep (SSC) model to represent the host soil. The SSC model is a three-dimensional isotropic elasto-viscoplastic model suitable for normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated clays, silts, and peat. The granular column material has been modelled using the elasto-plastic Hardening Soil (HS) model. The soil profile adopted is that of the Bothkennar geotechnical test bed in Scotland, consisting of an overconsolidated crust overlying two layers of soft lightly overconsolidated Carse clay. Simplified single-layer profiles based on the Bothkennar parameters were used for preliminary numerical modelling purposes, before the full profile was considered. An examination of the evolution of settlement improvement factor (defined as the ratio of the settlement of untreated to treated ground) with time, using PLAXIS 2 D, indicates that the inclusion of creep leads to a lower Â¿totalÂ¿ settlement improvement factor than would be obtained for primary consolidation settlement alone. Parametric studies have indicated, as expected, that this effect is more pronounced in situations where creep settlements account for a greater proportion of the total settlement. The numerical output has also been used to derive separate Â¿primaryÂ¿ and Â¿creepÂ¿ settlement improvement factors. The Â¿primaryÂ¿ settlement improvement factors, which were found to be in relatively good agreement with a selection of pre-existing analytical formulations (which pertain to primary settlement only), tend to be much larger than the Â¿creepÂ¿ settlement improvement factors. Nevertheless, the latter factors are greater than unity, suggesting that columns help reduce creep settlements. Consideration of the variations of radial, vertical, and hoop stresses and strains with time and depth predicted by PLAXIS 2 D has highlighted how creep influences the behaviour of the composite system, in particular the stress transfer process from soil to column. As the soil <b>creeps,</b> <b>vertical</b> stress is transferred from soil to column; the amount of stress transferred increases with depth. It is demonstrated in the thesis that the lower Â¿totalÂ¿ settlement improvement factors (owing to the presence of creep) occur because the columns, which have already yielded, are forced to carry additional vertical stress, inducing additional shear-plane formation. In addition, both the radial and hoop stresses in the soil are lower in treated ground than in untreated ground; these radial and hoop stresses are lower in a soil that creeps. The radial stress reduction means that the lateral support imparted onto the column by the soil is lower; this will also contribute to lower Â¿totalÂ¿ settlement improvement factors but is not as influential as the additional yielding caused by the vertical stress transfer process. The hoop stress reductions for the Â¿with creepÂ¿ case are caused by the additional plastic deformation but do not contribute to the lower Â¿totalÂ¿ settlement improvement factors. The impact of creep on the stress transfer process for floating columns is similar to that for end-bearing columns; the soil is unloaded and the magnitude of this stress transfer (unloading) increases with depth. Given that this geotechnical problem is being investigated numerically for the first time, it is appropriate that the emphasis of the work is on obtaining practical estimates of the likely behaviour of stone columns in creep-prone soils rather than on the subtleties of complex higher-order models. Nevertheless, selected analyses, repeated using the advanced Creep-SCLAY 1 S model (which incorporates anisotropy, bonding, and destructuration and is not yet commercially available with PLAXIS), have yielded very similar findings to those obtained using the SSC model. However, settlement improvement factors (Â¿primaryÂ¿ and Â¿totalÂ¿) are lower when destructuration is considered because column presence triggers bond degradation. The majority of existing analytical settlement design methods pertain to primary settlement only, {{and in the absence of}} further guidance, designers will tend to apply the same improvement factor to creep settlements as they have estimated for primary settlements. To overcome this, a simplified empirical design procedure that accounts for the influence of creep has been developed based on a parametric study carried out using the SSC model with a view to identifying appropriate variables which influence the aforementioned improvement factors. The parameters have been altered in a specific range so that they are representative of those typically encountered for soft (creep-prone) clays in practice. It is suggested that the method is used in conjunction with an existing primary settlement design method that captures all key features of primary settlement behaviour. Finally, a novel procedure which uses Cylindrical Cavity Expansion (CCE) theory in conjunction with the conventional 2 ̆ 7 wished-in-place 2 ̆ 7 installation technique to account for column installation has also been used for a selection of analyses. A two-step process was implemented: (i) CCE theory has been used to work out post-installation lateral earth pressure coefficients caused by the lateral expansion of the vibrating poker when columns are installed in soft clay, and (ii) the new earth pressure coefficients have been incorporated in a standard axisymmetric unit cell model to establish their influence on settlement improvement factors for an infinite column grid. This two-step approach can be used as an improvement upon the conventional Â¿wished-in-placeÂ¿ column installation technique, with larger settlement improvement factors predicted when installation (increased earth pressure coefficients) is taken into account. For stage (i), a comparison of the SSC model output with and without creep has been used to give an indication of the possible effect of column construction on lateral earth pressure coefficients surrounding columns in creep-prone soils. The stage (ii) output has indicated that the conclusions heretofore are unaffected if installation is or is not considered; incorporating creep leads to lower settlement improvement factors...|$|R
