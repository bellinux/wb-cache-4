50|$|Pfünz Roman Fort (Kastell Pfünz), Castra Vetoniana or Vetonianae, was a Roman cohort {{camp near}} Pfünz, {{a village in}} the {{municipality}} of Walting in the county of Eichstätt, Bavaria. It was built in about 90 A. D. on a 42-metre-high Jurassic hillspur between {{the valley of the}} Altmühl and that of the Pfünzer Bach stream. it is a component of the Rhaetian Limes which was elevated in 2005 to the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Of historical importance are the remains of the double <b>V-shaped</b> <b>ditches</b> hewn out of the rock in front of the position, the one on the western rampart being the best preserved. In 1998, as part of the construction of a high pressure water system, the Bavarian State Office for Monument Protection carried out further test excavations. The archaeological record and rich finds from Pfünz, some of which are very rare, are seen as reasons for further studies in the future.|$|R

40|$|Widespread {{contamination}} of California water bodies by the organophosphate insecticides diazinon and chlorpyrifos is well documented. While their usage has decreased {{over the last}} few years, a concomitant increase in pyrethroid usage (e. g., permethrin) (replacement insecticides) has occurred. Vegetated agricultural drainage ditches (VADD) have been proposed as a potential economical and environmentally effi cient management practice to mitigate the eff ects of pesticides in irrigation and storm runoff. Th ree ditches were constructed in Yolo County, California for a fi eld trial. A U-shaped vegetated <b>ditch,</b> a <b>V-shaped</b> vegetated <b>ditch,</b> and a <b>V-shaped</b> unvegetated <b>ditch</b> were each amended for 8 h with a mixture of diazinon, permethrin, and suspended sediment simulating an irrigation runoff event. Water, sediment, and plant samples were collected spatially and temporally and analyzed for diazinon and permethrin concentrations. Pesticide half-lives were similar between ditches and pesticides, ranging from 2. 4 to 6. 4 h. Diff erences in half-distances (distance required to reduce initial pesticide concentration by 50 %) among pesticides and ditches were present, indicating importance of vegetation in mitigation. Cis-permethrin half-distances in V ditches ranged from 22 m (V-vegetated) to 50 m (V-unvegetated). Half-distances for trans-permethrin were similar, ranging from 21 m (V-vegetated) to 55 m (V-unvegetated). Diazinon half-distances demonstrated the greatest diff erences (55 m for V-vegetated and 158 m for V-unvegetated). Such economical and environmentally successful management practices will off er farmers, ranchers, and landowners a viable alternative to more conventional (and sometimes expensive) practices...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{resistivity}} tomography (ERT) {{is gaining}} in {{importance in the}} field of archeological site prospecting. This contrasting study examines the results of mapping archeological structures and the resulting archeological excavation results. The study aims to show the boundaries of interpreting ERT scans and possible sources of error in interpreting ERT scan results. To accomplish this, ERT scans were performed at two selected sites in South West Germany. The results were then compared with later archeological excavation findings at these sites. Studies at the quadrangular Celtic enclosure near Sinsheim-Dühren in the Kraichgau have shown that the perimeter of <b>V-shaped</b> <b>ditches</b> can be distinguished well from the surrounding bed rock and back-fill. The resolution of the perimeter is not without uncertainty but the uncertainty is on such a minor scale that it does not affect the planning of an archeological dig at the site in question. Artifacts in ERT measurement interpretations could be linked to computational difficulties in the inversion routines. The impact of such artifacts depend on the chosen calculation configuration though. As a result of the measurements taken at "Gewann Steinbock" near Sinsheim-Dühren a soil map was created. More importantly though, the unique Celtic tomb was accurately localized within the quadrangular Celtic enclosure with the help of ERT. Research at a celtic ore smelting site in the Grösseltal near Neuenbürg (Enzkreis) in the northern Black Forrest showed that the interpretation of data taken near lightly slag-rich heaps in partially rocky terrain is not possible without error. Also, localizing and determining the extent of the bloomeries could not be determined reliably via the ERT method. The ability to successfully localize the extracting traces of the celtic ore smelting site via the ERT method though were proven. After inspecting the sight for visible terraces with advancing upstream heaps, in depth ERT scans could be performed to localize access shafts, binges or other cavities in the perimeter of the terrace. Artifacts in ERT measurement could in turn be linked to computational difficulties in the inversion routines. A current limit to the ERT method lies in interlocked archeological finds in combination with the inversion routine interpretation. The ability to be able to distinguish between misinterpretations and actual archeological finds therefore is important...|$|R
50|$|The milefortlet was trial-trenched in 1954 and 1974, {{and fully}} {{excavated}} in 1975. The excavations revealed a rectangular fort measuring 40 metres by 50 metres. The original defence was a turf rampart 7 metres wide {{surrounded by a}} <b>v-shaped</b> <b>ditch.</b> There were three distinct phases in the fort's history when each time it was demolished and rebuilt. The dating {{evidence suggests that the}} fort was occupied throughout most of the 2nd century.|$|E
50|$|The fort covers 11 acre, {{measuring}} 450 ft {{from north}} to south and 200 ft from east to west. It is surrounded by a 24 ft wide earth rampart. To the north was a <b>V-shaped</b> <b>ditch</b> that was 15 ft wide and 6 ft deep, to the south one 22 ft wide and 7 ft deep. Faint traces of a second rampart or defensive terrace to the north were observed in 1959, and 19th century observers recorded the existence of a third line of ramparts and ditches, though no traces of these remain.|$|E
5000|$|The hill fort was {{constructed}} {{during the first}} century BC, likely in a rapidly executed project carried out on a massive scale. Around 100 BC, a <b>V-shaped</b> <b>ditch</b> about 1.5 m deep was initially cut to form the outer perimeter of Oldbury Camp and the spoil was heaped up to form a bank. The defences follow a rough diamond shape, measuring 1350 m north-south by 700 m east-west. The eastern side above the cliffs was probably defended only by a wooden pallisade, as the cliffs there made it unnecessary to continue the bank and ditch along the escarpment.|$|E
50|$|In Roman times, the fort's {{northern}} wall lay {{directly on}} the seashore, which served as a harbour. Since then, the shoreline has receded, and the fort now lies inland. The fort was of a rectangular shape with rounded corners, with a 10 ft wide wall with internal turrets at the corners and backed by an earthen rampart, which increased the wall's strength and gave {{easy access to the}} battlements. In front of the wall there was a <b>V-shaped</b> single <b>ditch.</b> The wall thus enclosed an area of 2.56 ha. In typical castrum fashion, the fort had four gates, one on each side. Evidence of the eastern and western gates and of flanking towers survives. Aerial survey has revealed the existence of several buildings in the fort's interior, including the principia. A civilian settlement (vicus) existed on the eastern and northern sides of the fort, which has been dated to the 2nd century AD. Its size would make it one of the largest settlements in the territory of the Iceni tribe. Because the streets of the settlement are not aligned with the layout of the fort, it has been hypothesised that an earlier fort, built of timber, existed at the site, possibly from as early as the revolt of Queen Boudicca in the mid-1st century AD.|$|R
50|$|In the {{excavation}} of November 2007 {{under the guidance}} of Margrit Balmerm, there were found well plates that were used by the Celts for making money. The researchers believe that in the wells, small amounts of metal were melt and the metal blanks produced thereby, and the planchets were later used for coinage. The 1st century BC inhabitants of the Celtic Zürich therefore lived in a settlement Turicum that ware was more significant than assumed before. So also a <b>v-shaped</b> Celtic <b>ditch</b> was diggen out, which was discovered a few years ago {{at the site of the}} former Oetenbach nunnery, that was probably not an extern but an inner moat. This finding is important because the Celts of the late LaäTène period divided their settlements with trenches in different zones. As in other Celtic settlements, hthis moat marks artisans' quarter, a lodging for the nobilitas, cult districts and public spaces. Emil Vogt assumed in the 1960s for traces of an early Roman military system, which he put into context with the Roman Alps campaigns in the year 15 v. Chr., and so the Celtic finds in the beginning have been classified as Roman findst. On occasions of the renovations at Rennweg, archaeologists discovered in 1989 for the first time traces of a Celtic settlement. The significance of the findings was recognized, however, only when in sewer rehabilitation remains of Celtic buildings a few years later have been found. Since then, archaeologists have made further discoveries during excavations at the foot of the Lindenhof hill, whose scientific evaluation proves the Celtic settlement. Recent discoveries set older finds in a new light, and the interpretation of the research is still not succeeded, and therefore old finds will be re-interpreted.|$|R

50|$|The {{remains of}} the {{civilian}} city extended around the fortress (on the top). Housing around the upper (real roman) fort was in fact measuring more than 11 square kilometres, lightly fortified, area densely populated by the Germanic tribes of Marcomanni (or Quadi) - (the part of them traded and collaborated with the Romans and enjoyed luxury roman goods). They had {{the best out of}} comfort of (partly) civilised life. The area was (of natural development) bounded by left (northern) bank of Dyje river in the south, right (western) bank of Jihlava River in the east and in the north by rectangular plan enclosed <b>V-shaped</b> <b>ditch</b> (and light fence ?). History of this area and its development is probably more older than history of real Roman fort on top of the hill.|$|E
50|$|In 1898, an {{excavation}} {{took place}} at the Barland Castle site by Lt. Colonel W.Ll. Morgan, during which the sockets of rows of timber stakes were found {{around the edge of the}} bank which indicated that there was a heavy defensive palisade once located there. Morgan made three cuts into the bank, revealing a 2.5 m deep <b>v-shaped</b> <b>ditch</b> in the rampart and identifying the location of two separate rows of stakes some 1.83 m apart. The forward row of stakes measured between 6.4 - 11.4 cm in diameter, and were placed an average of 30 cm apart from each other. The rear row was less uniform. While no evidence was found of a building on top of the mound, late 12th/early 13th century pottery shards were discovered, along with a belt buckle and the soles of leather shoes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{spite of}} the {{surrounding}} land being cultivated in past centuries the almost perfectly circular rampart, 70 to 85 metres in diameter whose interior covers about 0.2 ha, is well preserved. It still retains its original height of 3 metres. The rampart was made of plaggen, turves cut from peat bogs. In front {{of it to the}} south, facing the direction of attack, is a dry <b>V-shaped</b> <b>ditch</b> (Spitzgraben), 2 m deep and 6 m wide. Between the rampart and the ditch is a 5 m berm. The ditch was crossed by an earth bridge that led to the only entrance on {{the eastern side of the}} rampart. This is still visible today as a break in the embankment. To the north protection was afforded by the River Fuhse which, at that time, was about 50 m from the position.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 400 m {{south of}} the site at Romancamp gate a second site was {{excavated}} in 1967 by Kenneth St Joseph, who traced a <b>V-shaped</b> <b>ditch</b> running for 975 ft on a north-south alignment, measuring 7 ft wide and 3 ft deep where best preserved. St Joseph identified the position and profile of the ditch as strongly suggesting it was Roman, in which case he felt it would probably form part of a camp from the Flavian period measuring up to 900 ft by 1200 ft and occupying around 30 acres. Aerial photography in 1984 recorded another linear cropmark on the site with a well-rounded northern corner, that was excavated in 1986 and revealed the shallow remains of a ditch about 2 m wide. Study of other aerial photographs taken on the 1970s and 1980s by the University of Cambridge suggests cropmarks provisionally showing {{the characteristics of a}} Roman camp lying to the east of Bellie old church and partially covered by an adjacent plantation.|$|E
50|$|The camp came {{to light}} after finds made with metal {{detectors}} led the regional archaeologist Dr. Schade-Lindig from the Hesse state office for memorial maintenance {{to carry out the}} first investigations in the Großer Wald (“Great Forest”) east of Oberbrechen between 1999 and 2001. Lying near a group of Hallstatt-era barrows, the site had long been known to contain something historical, but since it had never been properly investigated, it had always been taken to be a sconce from the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). In particular, the site’s good state of preservation had led to this interpretation, but already by 1915, a denarius from Augustus’s time had been found there. The latest investigations have yielded the knowledge that this site was girded by a typical Roman <b>V-shaped</b> <b>ditch,</b> within which spread an area of roughly two hectares.

5000|$|After the Romans invaded Britain in the 1st century, {{they quickly}} {{established}} {{control over the}} southeast corner of the island, but for {{at least a couple of}} decades they did not advance north and west in an attempt to subdue the rest of the island. Two legionary fortresses were established; one at Isca (Exeter) in the southwest corner of the territory and the other at Lindum (Lincoln) in the northeast. A road, now known as the Fosse Way, was then established between the two to help control the border. The Fosse Way crossed the Soar close to the site of the British settlement. One of the enigmas of Ratae's early development was whether or not there was ever a garrison stationed in the vicinity. The location - at a river crossing on a strategic road near a native settlement - would have been an ideal place for a fort. As yet, however, there is minimal evidence of one: only a single <b>V-shaped</b> <b>ditch</b> with a drainage slot at the bottom, found on the island between the two river channels. This ditch is similar in form to a type of military ditch known as a punic ditch, with one side steeper than the other and a drainage slot at the bottom.

40|$|Here, {{we study}} the {{mechanisms}} underlying a method used {{to limit the}} formation of trench defects in InGaN/GaN quantum well structures by using H 2 in the carrier gas {{for the growth of}} GaN barriers. The method leads to a complete removal of the trench defects by preventing the formation of basal-plane stacking faults from which trench defects originate, as well as preventing the formation of stacking mismatch boundaries. The penalty paid for the absence of trench defects is the formation of InGaN wells with gross well-width fluctuations where the H 2 gas has etched away the indium locally. Where a fully formed trench defect (stacking mismatch boundary opened as <b>V-shaped</b> <b>ditch)</b> already exists in the structure, the GaN barrier growth method using H 2 results in a strongly disturbed structure of the quantum well stack in the enclosed region, with the quantum wells and barriers being in places significantly thinner than their counterparts in the surrounding material.
