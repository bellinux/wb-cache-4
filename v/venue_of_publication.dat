50|$|Preprint Servers come in many varieties, but the {{standard}} traits across them are stable: {{they seek to}} create a quick, free, open access, open source mode of communicating scientific knowledge to the public. Preprint servers act as a venue to quickly disseminate research that has typically been accepted into a formal, pree-reviewed <b>venue</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication.</b> Also typical of preprint servers is their lack of a peer-review process - typically, preprint servers {{have some type of}} quality check in place to ensure a minimum standard of publication, but this mechanism {{is not the same as}} a peer-review mechanism. Some preprint servers have explicitly partnered with the broader open science movement. Preprint servers typically imitate the resources offered by a full journal, as they seek to make available all posted articles on Google Scholar, while also collecting data about citations. Especially unique is the feature to make articles available to the public through social media sharing which does not require potential readers to create new accounts with the preprint servers. The case for preprint servers is often made based on the slow pace of conventional publication formats. The motivation to start Socarxiv, an open-access preprint server for social science research, is the claim that valuable research being published in traditional venues often times takes several months to tears to get published, which slows down the process of science significantly. Another argument made in favor of preprint servers like Socarxiv is the quality and quickness of feedback offered to scientists on their pre-published work. The founders of Socarxiv claim that their platform allows researchers to gain easy feedback from their colleagues on the platform, thereby allowing scientists to develop their work into the highest possible quality before formal publication and circulation. The founders of Socarxiv further claim that their platform affords the authors the greatest level of flexibility in updating and editing their work to ensure that the latest version is available for rapid dissemination. The founders claim that this is not traditionally the case with formal journals, which instate formal procedures to make updates to published articles. Perhaps the strongest advantage of some preprint servers is their seamless compatibility with Open Science software such as the Open Science Framework. The founders of SocArXiv claim that their preprint server connects all aspects of the research life cycle in OSF with the article being published on the preprint server. According to the founders, this allows for greater transparency and minimal work on the authors' part.|$|E

40|$|Following {{previous}} research findings, this paper {{argues that the}} current method of evaluating scholar performance, publication counts in “quality ” journals is flawed by subjectivity in generating the list of approved journals and the definition of quality. Truex, Cuellar and Takeda (2009) sought to improve on this method by substituting the measurement of “influence ” using the Hirsch statistics to measure ideational influence. Since the h-family statistics are a measure of productivity and the uptake of a scholar’s ideas this methodology privileges the uptake of a scholar’s ideas over the <b>venue</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication.</b> But influence is built through other means than by having one’s papers read and cited.

40|$|The {{diversity}} of IS programs and {{research has been}} of interest to various professions. It {{has been argued that}} IS has developed to the extent where it does not have to rely on other reference disciplines, but should rather serve as a reference discipline for other disciplines. While IS may have developed its own discipline, its location in different academic units may influence the venue of faculty publications. The understanding of the relationships between <b>venue</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication</b> and location of IS programs will influence curriculum development especially at the doctoral level and inform faculty placement decisions. In this paper, we examine IS research that falls into the professional categories of business, engineering, education, and library science for faculty from information systems programs. We examined the research publications of the faculty from the twenty-four IS programs accredited by ABET Inc. The data shows that irrespective of the location of the IS program, over 50 % of the faculty publications are in the Engineering venue. Further, the results indicate that the location of the IS program influences the publication venue. We also suggest that the tenure and promotion requirements also influence the venue of the publications of IS faculty. Our research contributes to both professional practice and scholarly research. In academia, we suggest that the interest of the faculty may influence their employment location...|$|E

Many of these researchers were at The Rockefeller Institute of Medicine, the predecessor of The Rockefeller University. As their work progressed to publication, they were disappointed with the limited quality of halftone image reproduction in the printed journals of the time, and frustrated by the narrow editorial policies of existing journals regarding their image-based results.

40|$|A common {{consensus}} in the literature is that the citation profile of published articles in general follows a universal pattern - an initial {{growth in the number}} of citations within the first two to three years after publication followed by a steady peak of one to two years and then a final decline over the rest of the lifetime of the article. This observation has long been the underlying heuristic in determining major bibliometric factors such as the quality of a publication, the growth of scientific communities, impact factor of publication venues etc. In this paper, we gather and analyze a massive dataset of scientific papers from the computer science domain and notice that the citation count of the articles over the years follows a remarkably diverse set of patterns - a profile with an initial peak (PeakInit), with distinct multiple peaks (PeakMul), with a peak late in time (PeakLate), that is monotonically decreasing (MonDec), that is monotonically increasing (MonIncr) and that can not be categorized into any of the above (Oth). We conduct a thorough experiment to investigate several important characteristics of these categories such as how individual categories attract citations, how the categorization is influenced by the year and the <b>venue</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication</b> of papers, how each category is affected by self-citations, the stability of the categories over time, and how much each of these categories contribute to the core of the network. Further, we show that the traditional preferential attachment models fail to explain these citation profiles. Therefore, we propose a novel dynamic growth model that takes both the preferential attachment and the aging factor into account in order to replicate the real-world behavior of various citation profiles. We believe that this paper opens the scope for a serious re-investigation of the existing bibliometric indices for scientific research.

5000|$|Prior to {{the early}} 2000s, the primary <b>venue</b> for <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> gay men's manga was gay men's general-interest magazines, which have {{included}} manga {{since the inception of}} Barazoku in 1971.

40|$|Abstract. Classification {{algorithms}} usually {{assume that}} any {{example in the}} training set should contribute equally to the classification model being generated. However, {{this is not always}} the case. This paper shows that the contribution of an example to the classification model varies according to many factors, which are application dependent, and can be estimated using what we call a credibility function. The credibility of an entity reflects how much value it aggregates to a task being performed, and here we investigate it in Automatic Document Classification, where the credibility of a document relates to its terms, authors, citations, <b>venues,</b> time <b>of</b> <b>publication,</b> among others. After introducing the concept of credibility in classification, we investigate how to estimate a credibility function using information regarding documents content, citations and authorship using mainly metrics previously defined in the literature. As the credibility of the content of a document can be easily mapped to any other classification problem, in a second phase we focus on content-based credibility functions. We propose a genetic programming algorithm to estimate this function based on a large set of metrics generally used to measure the strength of term-class relationship. The proposed and evolved credibility functions are then incorporated to the Näıve Bayes classifier, and applied to four text collections, namely ACM-DL, Reuters, Ohsumed, and 20 Newsgroup. The results obtained showed significant improvements in both micro-F 1 and macro-F 1, with gains up to 21 % in Ohsumed when compared to the traditional Näıve Bayes...|$|R
