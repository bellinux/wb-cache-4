5|$|Jackson's {{skin was}} a medium-brown color {{throughout}} his youth; however, {{starting in the}} mid 1980s, his skin gradually grew paler, which was partly due to <b>vitiligo,</b> but also widely considered {{to be due to}} skin bleaching and changing of his features to appear white. According to Jackson's biographer, J. Randy Taraborrelli, in 1984, Jackson was diagnosed with <b>vitiligo,</b> which Taraborrelli stated was sometimes considered by doctors to be a consequence of damage done by bleaching chemicals over the years. However, <b>vitiligo</b> is a rare non-contagious disease; the causes are not known, but a range of genetic, auto-immune, and environmental factors are suspected {{to play a role in}} this disease. Between 1% and 2% of the world population is considered to be affected. The depigmentation occurs in patches and affects all ethnic/racial groups equally.|$|E
5|$|Taraborrelli {{stated that}} Jackson was {{diagnosed}} with lupus, that the <b>vitiligo</b> partially lightened his skin, and the lupus was in remission, and both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight, which could have caused his lupus condition to recur. Jackson's autopsy did not confirm or refute the claim that he had lupus, but it did confirm that he had <b>vitiligo.</b> His skin {{was found to have}} reduced (though not absent) melanocytes, the cells active in skin pigmentation.|$|E
5|$|During March 2015, Hamm's {{representative}} {{confirmed that}} Hamm had recently completed inpatient treatment for alcoholism. Additionally, Hamm reported developing <b>vitiligo</b> throughout {{the filming of}} Mad Men.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{during the}} Australian {{leg of the}} HIStory World Tour, Jackson married his dermatologist's nurse, Debbie Rowe. The pair first met in the mid-1980s, when Jackson was {{diagnosed}} with <b>vitiligo.</b> She spent many years treating his illness {{as well as providing}} emotional support, and they built a strong friendship before their marriage. The couple divorced in 1999 and remained friends thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Hashimoto's {{thyroiditis}} is an autoimmune {{disorder in}} which the thyroid gland is infltrated by the lymphocytes B-cell and T-cells. These progressively destroy the thyroid gland. In this way, Hasimoto's thyroiditis may have occurred insidiously, and only be noticed when thyroid hormone production decreases, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's {{is more common in}} females than males, much more common after the age of 60, and has known genetic risk factors. Also more common in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are type 1 diabetes, pernicious anaemia, Addison's disease <b>vitiligo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, <b>vitiligo,</b> and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E
5|$|Jackson gave a 90-minute {{interview}} to Oprah Winfrey on February 10, 1993, his second television interview since 1979. He grimaced when speaking {{of his childhood}} abuse {{at the hands of}} his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of the Elephant Man, slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated {{for the first time that}} he had <b>vitiligo.</b> Dangerous re-entered the album chart in the top 10, more than a year after its original release.|$|E
5|$|Michael Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American {{singer who}} spent over four {{decades in the}} public eye, first as a child star with The Jackson 5, and later as a solo artist, during which time he went through various image changes. Starting in the mid-1980s, {{it became clear that}} Jackson's {{appearance}} was changing dramatically. The shape of his face, particularly his nose, triggered widespread speculation of extensive cosmetic surgery. His skin tone became much lighter. Although Jackson, a black man, was diagnosed with the skin disorder <b>vitiligo,</b> which results in white patches on the skin, and said that he had not purposely bleached his skin but had used makeup to even out his skin tone, it was also widely suggested that his lighter skin tone was partly due to skin bleaching.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vitiligo</b> is a {{condition}} that causes depigmentation of sections of skin. It occurs when melanocytes die or are unable to function. The cause of <b>vitiligo</b> is unknown, but research suggests that it may arise from autoimmune, genetic, oxidative stress, neural, or viral causes. The incidence worldwide is less than 1%. Individuals affected by <b>vitiligo</b> sometimes suffer psychological discomfort because of their appearance.|$|E
25|$|Globally about 1% {{of people}} are {{affected}} by <b>vitiligo.</b> Some populations have rates as high as 2–3%. Males and females are equally affected. About half show the disorder before age 20 and most develop it before age 40. <b>Vitiligo</b> has been described since ancient history.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vitiligo</b> surgery – Including {{procedures}} like autologous melanocyte transplant, suction blister grafting {{and punch}} grafting.|$|E
25|$|The only sign of <b>vitiligo</b> is the {{presence}} of pale patchy areas of depigmented skin which tend to occur on the extremities.|$|E
25|$|Laser therapy – {{for both}} the {{management}} of birth marks, skin disorders (like <b>vitiligo),</b> tattoo removal, and cosmetic resurfacing and rejuvenation.|$|E
25|$|UV rays also treat certain skin conditions. Modern {{phototherapy}} {{has been}} used to successfully treat psoriasis, eczema, jaundice, <b>vitiligo,</b> atopic dermatitis, and localized scleroderma.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vitiligo</b> is a {{long term}} skin {{condition}} characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment. The patches of skin affected become white and usually have sharp margins. The hair from the skin may also become white. Inside the mouth and nose may also be involved. Typically {{both sides of the}} body are affected. Often the patches begin on areas of skin that are exposed to the sun. It is more noticeable in people with dark skin. <b>Vitiligo</b> may result in psychological stress and those affected may be stigmatized.|$|E
25|$|Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} seen in dogs characterized by uveitis (inflammation of {{the inside of the}} eye), poliosis (whitening of hair), and <b>vitiligo</b> (loss of pigment in the skin).|$|E
25|$|Having another {{autoimmune}} diseases is a {{risk factor}} to develop Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and the opposite is also true. Autoimmune diseases most commonly associated to Hashimoto’s thyroiditis include celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, <b>vitiligo,</b> and alopecia.|$|E
25|$|The convalescent {{phase is}} {{characterized}} by gradual tissue depigmentation of skin with <b>vitiligo</b> and poliosis, sometimes with nummular depigmented scars, as well as alopecia and diffuse fundus depigmentation resulting in a classic orange-red discoloration ("sunset glow fundus") and retinal pigment epithelium clumping and/or migration.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} is helpful {{in the treatment}} of skin conditions such as psoriasis and <b>vitiligo.</b> Exposure to UVA, while the skin is hyper-photosensitive, by taking psoralens is an effective treatment for psoriasis. Due to the potential of psoralens to cause damage to the liver, PUVA therapy may be used {{only a limited number of}} times over a patient's lifetime.|$|E
25|$|A-T {{can cause}} {{features}} of early aging such as premature graying of the hair. It {{can also cause}} <b>vitiligo</b> (an auto-immune disease causing loss of skin pigment resulting in a blotchy “bleach-splashed” look), and warts which can be extensive and recalcitrant to treatment. A {{small number of people}} develop a chronic inflammatory skin disease (granulomas).|$|E
25|$|People with A-T {{also have}} an {{increased}} risk of developing autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases. This risk is probably a secondary effect of their immunodeficiency and not a direct effect of the lack of ATM protein. The most common examples of such disorders in A-T include immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), several forms of arthritis, and <b>vitiligo.</b>|$|E
25|$|Medical tattoos {{are used}} to ensure {{instruments}} are properly located for repeated application of radiotherapy and for the areola in some forms of breast reconstruction. Tattooing has also been used to convey medical information about the wearer (e.g., blood group, medical condition, etc.). Additionally, tattoos are used in skin tones to cover <b>vitiligo,</b> a skin pigmentation disorder.|$|E
25|$|Various {{types of}} {{albinism}} {{are a result}} of genetic mutations affecting different parts of the melanin production pathway. In a person with albinism, melanocytes can be entirely absent, or fail to produce melanin, or melanosomes can fail to mature and be transferred to keranocytes. The ability to produce melanin in patches around the body is a condition known as <b>vitiligo.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} cure for <b>vitiligo.</b> For those with light skin, {{sunscreen}} and makeup {{are all that}} is typically recommended. Other treatment options may include steroid creams or phototherapy to darken the light patches. Alternatively, efforts to lighten the unaffected skin, such as with hydroquinone, may be tried. A number of surgical options are available {{for those who do}} not improve with other measures. A combination of treatments generally has better outcomes. Counselling to provide emotional support may be useful.|$|E
25|$|The lamps used in {{phototherapy}} {{contain a}} phosphor that emits only UVB ultraviolet light. There are two types: broadband UVB that gives 290–320 nanometer with peak wavelength of 306nm, and narrowband UVB that gives 311–313 nanometer. Due to its longer wavelength the narrowband UVB requires a 10 times higher dose to the skin, {{compared to the}} broadband. The narrowband is good for psoriasis, eczema (atopic dermatitis), <b>vitiligo,</b> lichen planus, and some other skin diseases. The broadband is better for increasing Vitamin D3 in the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause is}} {{typically}} unknown. It {{is believed to}} be due to genetic susceptibility that is triggered by an environmental factor such that an autoimmune disease occurs. This results in the destruction of skin pigment cells. Risk factors include a family history of the condition or other autoimmune diseases, such as hyperthyroidism, alopecia areata, and pernicious anemia. It is not contagious. <b>Vitiligo</b> is classified into two main types: segmental and non-segmental. Most cases are non-segmental, meaning they affect both sides; and in these cases, the affected area of the skin typically expands with time. About 10% of cases are segmental, meaning they mostly involve one side of the body; and in these cases, the affected area of the skin typically does not expand with time. Diagnosis can be confirmed by tissue biopsy.|$|E
25|$|On February 10, 1993, Winfrey {{sat down}} with Michael Jackson for {{what would become the}} most-watched {{interview}} in television history. Jackson, an intensely private entertainer, had not given an interview in 14 years. The event was broadcast live from Jackson's Neverland Ranch and was watched by 90 million people worldwide. Jackson discussed missing out on a normal childhood and his strained relationship with his father, Joe Jackson. During the interview, Jackson attempted to dispel many of the rumors surrounding him and told Winfrey he suffered from the skin-pigment disorder known as <b>vitiligo</b> when asked about the change in the color of his skin. While admitting to getting a nose job, he denied all other plastic surgery rumors. Later in the interview, Jackson was joined by his close friend Elizabeth Taylor, her third appearance on the show.|$|E

500|$|Jackson's {{skin had}} been a medium-brown color during his youth, but from the mid-1980s {{gradually}} grew paler. The change gained widespread media coverage, including rumors {{that he might have}} been bleaching his skin. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography, Jackson was diagnosed with <b>vitiligo</b> in 1984; <b>vitiligo</b> results in white patches on the skin. Although Jackson was diagnosed with <b>vitiligo,</b> Taraborrelli stated that Jackson had been skin bleaching. He said that Jackson was diagnosed with lupus, and that while the <b>vitiligo</b> partially lightened Jackson's skin, the lupus was in remission. Both illnesses made Jackson's skin sensitive to sunlight. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin, and, with the application of pancake makeup to even out blotches he could appear pale. Jackson stated that although he used makeup to control the patchy appearance of his skin, he never purposely bleached his skin. He said of his vitiligo: [...] "It is something I cannot help. When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a problem for me. I can't control it." [...] Jackson was also diagnosed with <b>vitiligo</b> in his autopsy, though not lupus.|$|E
500|$|<b>Vitiligo</b> {{occurs in}} three {{different}} patterns. Segmental depigmentation means only {{one side of the}} body is affected, whereas generalized [...] depigmentation means many parts of the body are affected. Jackson's autopsy report states a [...] "focal depigmentation of the skin" [...] (i.e., the depigmentation occurs on one or a few areas of the body). In Jackson's case, there were 5 affected areas.|$|E
500|$|However, in 1993, Jackson told Oprah Winfrey [...] "there, as I know of, {{there is}} no such thing as skin bleaching. [...] I've never seen it, I don't know what it is." [...] It was in this {{interview}} that Jackson stated he had a skin disorder (<b>vitiligo)</b> and also stated that the disorder was hereditary, rather than something he caused; he also said he used make-up to even out the uneven skin tone. [...] "It is something I cannot help," [...] explained Jackson. [...] "When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a problem for me. I can't control it. But what about all the millions of people who sit in the sun to become darker, to become other than what they are. Nobody says nothing about that." [...] Winfrey's interview of Jackson was watched by 62million Americans. It also started a public discourse on the topic of <b>vitiligo,</b> a relatively unknown condition before then.|$|E
500|$|To {{treat these}} conditions, Jackson used Solaquin, Tretinoin, and Benoquin. On June 29, 2009, {{multiple}} tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone {{were found in}} Jackson's home. Both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo; Dr. David Sawcer said some patients with <b>vitiligo</b> {{get to the point}} where it makes more sense to remove the brown bits because so much of the skin is pale. On the other hand, getting depigmented skin to darken is extremely difficult. Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun. <b>Vitiligo</b> patients are at risk to contract melanoma, and an annual cancer check-up is recommended. Jackson also had hydroxychloroquine injected directly into his scalp regularly. Another common way of treating <b>vitiligo</b> is using makeup to camouflage depigmented skin. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and with the application of pancake makeup to even out his skin tone, he could appear very pale. For example, Stevie Nicks recalled in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I remember before , Michael sent somebody to find out if I had any foundation make-up he could borrow. I was using some light Chanel foundation at that time, and Michael sent back a note to say, thanks, but the foundation wasn't quite light enough for him." [...] Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for [...] "Remember the Time," [...] all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder.|$|E
500|$|New York {{plastic surgeon}} Dr. Pamela Lipkin, {{who has never}} treated Jackson or {{reviewed}} his medical records, said, [...] "when {{you look at the}} other features, the skin bleaching sort of goes along with what I think was his quest for beauty, so I have to wonder what came first? <b>Vitiligo</b> or lighter skin?" [...] Noting that Jackson had even skin tone when he was younger, Lipkin's interpretation was that [...] "probably he's trying to look Caucasian: His skin is whiter. His nose is getting thinner every six months. His lips are getting thinner. His eyebrows are getting higher. His eyes are getting wider every time. His cheekbones are getting bigger." ...|$|E
500|$|Debbie Rowe met Michael Jackson in the mid-1980s, {{while working}} as an {{assistant}} for the pop star's dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. Rowe treated Jackson's <b>vitiligo,</b> {{which he had been}} diagnosed with in 1986 and which would affect his physical appearance for the remainder of his life. Rowe supported Jackson, providing answers to the questions Jackson asked about his medical condition. The pair became good friends; the pop star frequently sent autographed merchandise to the woman, who hung it on the walls of her office. According to Rowe's friend Tanya Boyd, the dermatologist's assistant would obsess over Jackson, gushing over him and his traits. She would say to her friend, [...] "If people knew him like I knew him, they would not think he was strange. He's unique, kinky, actually." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout his {{marriage}} with Presley, Jackson maintained {{a friendship with}} Debbie Rowe. She was the assistant of the pop singer's dermatologist and had been treating his appearance-changing disease <b>vitiligo</b> since the mid-1980s. While separated but still married to Presley, Jackson impregnated Rowe, but she suffered a miscarriage and lost their baby in March 1996. Following the ordeal and the finalization of his first divorce, Jackson wed the pregnant Rowe on November 13, 1996, in Sydney, Australia. From the marriage, two of Jackson's three children were produced: son Michael Joseph [...] "Prince" [...] Jackson, Jr. (born February 13, 1997) and daughter Paris Michael Katherine Jackson (born April 3, 1998). Jackson and Rowe divorced on October 8, 1999, with Rowe giving full custody rights of the children to Jackson. His third and final child, son Prince Michael Jackson II, was born to an unnamed surrogate mother on February 21, 2002.|$|E
500|$|... its album tracks such as [...] "D.S." [...] and {{corresponding}} music videos are {{heavily influenced by}} the 1993 child sexual abuse accusations made against Jackson, {{the reaction to the}} allegations and the effect they had on the singer. The album acts as Jackson's response to the media and the public. In 1993, Evan Chandler and his son Jordan Chandler accused Jackson of child sexual abuse. Jackson agreed to a strip search of his body at Neverland Ranch; the strip search was ordered by Thomas W. Sneddon Jr., the district attorney of Santa Barbara County, California. Sneddon {{was in charge of the}} investigation as a whole. The accuser gave a detailed description of what he alleges were Jackson's genitals, also giving details on patches of <b>vitiligo</b> on the singer's body, but eventually the description was proved wrong. In an emotional state, Jackson stood on a platform in the middle of the room, took off all his clothes and was examined for approximately twenty-five minutes; he was never physically touched.|$|E
