5000|$|Computer {{hardware}} is {{a comprehensive}} term for all physical parts of a computer, as distinguished from the data it contains or operates on, and the software that provides instructions for the hardware to accomplish tasks. The boundary between hardware and software has become blurred, with the existence of firmware that is software [...] "built into" [...] the hardware. For example, a 2010-era LCD display screen contains a small computer inside. Mass-market consumer computers use highly standardized components and so are simple for an end user to assemble into a working system. Most 2010s-era computers only require users to plug in the power supply, monitor, and other cables. A typical desktop computer consists of a computer case (or [...] "tower"), a metal chassis that holds the power supply, motherboard, hard disk drive, and often an optical disc drive. Most towers have empty space where users can add additional components. External devices such as a computer monitor or <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>unit,</b> keyboard, and a pointing device (mouse) are usually found in a personal computer.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>unit,</b> {{computer}} monitor or just display, {{is a piece}} of electrical equipment, usually separate from the computer case, which displays visual images without producing a permanent computer record. A display device was usually either a CRT in the 1980s, but by the 2000s, flat panel displays such as a TFT LCD had largely replaced the bulkier, heavier CRT screens. Multi-monitor setups are quite common in the 2010s, as they enable a user to display multiple programs at the same time (e.g., an email inbox and a word processing program). The display unit houses an electronic circuitry that generates its picture from signals received from the computer. Within the computer, either integral to the motherboard or plugged into it as an expansion card, there is pre-processing circuitry to convert the microprocessor's output data to a format compatible with the display unit's circuitry. The images from {{computer monitor}}s originally contained only text, but as graphical user interfaces emerged and became common, they began to display more images and multimedia content. The term [...] "monitor" [...] is also used, particularly by technicians in broadcasting television, where a picture of the broadcast data is displayed to a highly standardized reference monitor for confidence checking purposes.|$|E
50|$|Early {{computers}} were typically operated using mechanical teleprinters, which provided a continuous printed record of their output. However, during the 1970s, these became obsolete and were replaced with <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>units,</b> and text was lost once it scrolled {{off the top}} of the screen. To compensate, programs typically paused operation after displaying one screen of data, so that the user could observe the results and then press a key to move to the next screen.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{workstations}} with <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> {{has become the}} subject of considerable interest and concern {{during the past few}} years.

A second is the effect on the human visual system of the frequent changes in surface illumination associated with <b>display</b> <b>units</b> used in combination with hard copy documents. As a consequence of these and other concerns, the popular press has published articles that have aroused the interest of various scientific organizations regarding the subject of these effects.

It is revealed that an honorary doctor named Magrew purchased Toulon’s trunk at auction by Megan Gallagher and manages the museum exabit in a small American countryside community to fund his research of duplicating André Toulon’s method of animation (without the assistance of Toulons journal). When Magrews daughter, Jane, returns from college, the two meet a gas station attendant named Robert [...] "Tank" [...] Winsley. Winsleys skill at carving wood is noticed by Magrew, and the boy is invited to stay with he and Jane if he agrees to carve a puppet for Magrews experiment. As Winsley and Jane grow closer, Magrew tries to discourage Jane from seeing Winsley, {{so that in the}} event where the boy leaves, Jane will not be hurt. However, Jane assures her father that Winsley would not leave her. After carving the pieces for Magrews puppet, Winsley becomes ill. Magrew calls for a doctor, and Jane is ordered to leave town to pick up a package for his sideshow. After learning that no package was sent, Jane races home, but, makes a stop to inspect debris she had found burnt in a ditch shortly before. In it, she finds a grotesque fleshy puppet who knows her name, which she identifies as her fathers former assistant; the role which Winsley has replaced. Winsley wakes restrained to a laboratory table, with Magrew nearby, brandishing a mechanical puppet of his own. Magrew transfers Winsleys soul into the machine, but before he can enjoy his success, Toulons puppets become enraged by his disgusting experiments, and they attack him. When Jane returns home, she finds her bloodied father and the mechanical puppet, recognizing it as Winsley because his face appears on a <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> on the robots head. Winsley then proceeds to electrocute Magrew to death.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Secure online {{transactions}} {{with human}} users normally require <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>units</b> for verifying the correctness of {{important elements of}} the transaction before it is being submitted.

This threat makes visual verification of transaction data unreliable, and undermines other security security mechanisms used for online transactions.
