In this paper, we extend the popular Wireless World Initiative for New Radio (WINNER) channel model with new features {{to make it as}} realistic as possible. Our approach enables more realistic evaluation results at an early stage of algorithm development. The new model supports 3 -D propagation, 3 -D antenna patterns, time evolving channel traces of arbitrary length, scenario transitions and <b>variable</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>speeds.</b> We validated the model by measurements in a coherent LTE advanced testbed in downtown Berlin, Germany. We then reproduced the same scenario in the model and compared several channel parameters (delay spread, path gain, K-factor, geometry factor and capacity). The results match very well and we can accurately predict the performance for an urban macro-cell setup with commercial high-gain antennas. At the same time, the computational complexity does not increase significantly and we can use all existing WINNER parameter tables. These artificial channels, having equivalent characteristics as measured data, enable virtual field trials long before prototypes are available...|$|R

40|$|This project {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> control of a synchronous generator. To achieve controlled <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> operation, the generator was loaded with a three phase Rectifier and a boost converter. A system as such can be an interesting option for <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> wind turbine applications. The electrical power quality can be improved while minimizing stresses in the drive chain. The terminal voltage of the generator can be controlled from the duty cycle if the booster output voltage is kept constant.

As the <b>speed</b> and the <b>terminal</b> voltage are directly related, speed of the generator can thus be controlled for a given torque. In the report, speed control technique of a synchronous machine with a step-up converter is presented. An experimental setup of a 7. 5 kV A machine was prepared.

50|$|As already mentioned, <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> wind {{turbines}} cannot be {{directly connected to}} a transmission system. One of the drawbacks {{of this is that}} the inertia of the transmission system is reduced as more <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> {{wind turbines}} are put online. This can result in more significant drops in the transmission system's voltage frequency in the event of the loss of a generating unit. Furthermore, <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> wind turbines require power electronics, which increases the complexity of the turbine and introduces new sources of failures.

40|$|Changes {{in power}} {{generation}} and supply and changes in water distribution systems are creating new opportunities for water utilities to enhance operational efficiency and income {{through the use of}} advanced control and optimisation. First, the increase in renewables penetration into the grid is causing a growth in energy storage schemes. Second, <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> pumps are now fitted to most new systems and many existing water distribution systems are being retrofitted with <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> pumps to improve the efficiency of the operation.

40|$|Diesel powered {{electric}} generators {{supply power}} to isolated grids around the world, often operating at low average load. The addition of renewable power to save fuel reduces engine load even further. This low load operation results in poor fuel efficiency and increased maintenance due to engine fouling, especially in cold ambient conditions. <b>Variable</b> <b>speed</b> operation of these diesel generator sets has been studied, in general, {{and as a}} solution to efficiency and fouling problems. <b>Variable</b> <b>speed</b> operation requires the addition of a supervisory controller and an electronic power converter to provide constant frequency power. ^ Conclusions are based on testing of diesel generators and thermodynamic and dynamic modeling. Tests included steady state tests of two diesel generators (5 kW and 15 kW systems) and tests of a prototype 5 kW <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> system. Heat release, combustion duration, and cylinder gas temperatures were derived from cylinder pressure data. System component design and the effects of component limitations on <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> operation are discussed. Once a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> operating strategy is determined for a sample 15 kW system, test data are used to determine fuel savings and to estimate the potential for improvements in emissions, cold weather fouling, and engine wear. ^ Results show that <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> systems are most applicable where the peak power system capability is large compared to the average load. In existing, isolated power systems fuel savings could be as high as 40 % of annual fuel. A comparison of combustion conditions between constant <b>speed</b> and <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> operation of diesel generator sets shows that unburned hydrocarbon emissions from local overleaning, wall quenching, and bulk quenching of combustion should be reduced with <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> operation. Likewise, particulate emissions and low load, cold weather engine fouling should be reduced. The effects on other sources of unburned hydrocarbon emissions and on NOx emissions are ambiguous. An analysis of corrosive and abrasive wear mechanisms shows that engine wear need not be a concern with <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> operation. The analysis also discusses factors affecting <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> operation of diesel generator sets larger than those tested in this study. ...|$|R

30|$|Such a {{projected}} high penetration of wind generation in power systems {{can affect the}} frequency stability. Nowadays, most of wind turbines (e.g. Doubly Fed Induction Generators) employ <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> constant frequency generation technology to produce electric power from variable wind [6]. Normally, <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> wind turbines do not contribute to system inertia since the rotor of the <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> wind turbines is running at a <b>variable</b> asynchronous <b>speed</b> and thus not sensitive to the change of system frequency [7, 8, 9]. The displacement {{of a large number}} of conventional synchronous generators with <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> wind turbines reduces system inertia. When the system is subjected to an unexpected disturbance that causes a significant system-wide power imbalance, the reduced system inertia can cause a larger and faster ROCOF and frequency nadir, which are two critical variables to set the relays for maintaining frequency stability [10, 11, 12].|$|R

30|$|The control {{algorithm}} used for deciding on the <b>speed</b> limit in <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> limit systems {{is crucial for}} the performance of the systems. The algorithm is designed to fulfil the purpose of the <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> limit system, which can be one or several of the following aspects: increasing safety, increasing efficiency and decreasing environmental impacts. Today, many of the {{control algorithm}}s used in practice are based on fixed thresholds in speed and/or flow. Therefore, they are not necessarily reflecting the current traffic conditions. Control algorithms with a greater level of complexity {{can be found in the}} literature. In this paper, four existing control algorithms are investigated to conclude on important characteristics affecting the performance of the <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> limit system. The purpose of the <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> limit system and, consequently, the design of the control algorithm differ. Requirements of the investigated control algorithms are that they should be easy to interpret and the execution time should be short. The algorithms are evaluated through microscopic traffic simulation. Performance indicators related to traffic safety, traffic efficiency and environmental impacts are presented. The results show that the characteristics of the <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> limit system and the design of the control algorithm will have effect on the resulting traffic performance, given that the drivers comply with the <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> limits. Moreover, the time needed to trigger the system, the duration and the size of speed limit reductions, and the location of the congestion are factors of importance {{for the performance of}} <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> limit systems.|$|R
