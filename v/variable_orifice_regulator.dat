The three basic approaches to structural control may be defined as follows passive control systems,active control systems and semi-active control systems. These systems have received much attention recently because they have versatility and adaptability of active control systems. Although there is a wide variety of these energy absorbing devices, but all have one thing in common. they absorb energy from the structure. Semi-active control systems possess the advantages of both active and passive control systems. <b>Variable</b> <b>orifice</b> dampers are semi-active control devices that utilize the hydraulic fluid flow to generate controllable damping forces. Depending {{on the state of the}} structure, the energy absorbing property of the <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> dampers is changed on the fly. In this study, the proposed semi-active control algorithm and the effect of <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> damper for seismic response reduction is examined. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed semi-active control algorithm and the usefulness of <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> dampers,controlled and uncontrolled behaviour of the three story model structure subjected to earthquake forces are investigated numerically.

The flow channel was identical to an SRE fuel channel and included simulated upper and lower plenums. The fuel element mockup was equipped with a Hallam-type <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> at the channel exit and a fixed orifice in the strainer basket {{at the bottom of}} the element. Tests were performed to determine the optimum size for the fixed orifice and the temperature adjustment capability of the <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> using this optimum fixed orifice. To obtain the predicted 4. 1 lb/sec sodium coolant requirement at a core pressure drop of 1. 85 psi, a 3 / 4 in. fixed orifice was determined to be the optimum. With this fixed <b>orifice</b> size the <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> will be approximately 1 in. withdrawn during full-power operation. Adjusting the orifice over its entire range of 3 in. from fully inserted to fully withdrawn covers a temperature range from 875 to 1040 deg F which is approximately plus or minus 80 'F about the normal outlet temperature of 960 deg F.

40|$|Control of {{the exit}} {{temperature}} of the coolant from each fuel channel of the Hallam Nuclear Power Facility reactor is obtained by adjusting the coolant flow rate by a remotely operated <b>variable</b> <b>orifice.</b> Two <b>variable</b> <b>orifices</b> were designed and the hydraulic characteristics determined. Both orifice designs utilized a tapered plug {{moving in and out}} of a restricted flow passage at the upper end of the fuel channel. Data were obtained on pressure drop as a function of flow rate at different orifice plug positions; all measurements were made using water, and data were converted to equivalent values for sodium. Either type of orifice was capable of adjusting flow rate to match the power output of a fuel element at any location in the reactor core. The temperature sensitivity (change in exit temperature per unit change in orifice plug position) of the first type of orifice was low (lO deg F/in.) when used in combination with a central fuel element, and high (7 OO deg F/in.) when used with a peripheral element. The temperature sensitivity of the second type was more uniform (varying from 90 to 250 deg F/ in.). Consequently, the second type of orifice was selected for the HNPF. (auth...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Portable {{peak flow}} meters {{are used in}} {{clinical}} practice for measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) at many different altitudes throughout the world. Some PEF meters are affected by gas density. This study was undertaken to establish which type of meter is best for use above sea level and to determine changes in spirometric measurements at altitude. METHODS: The <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> mini-Wright peak flow meter was compared with the fixed orifice Micro Medical Microplus turbine microspirometer at sea level and at Everest Base Camp (5300 m). Fifty one members of the 1994 British Mount Everest Medical Expedition were studied (age range, 19 - 55). RESULTS: Mean forced vital capacity (FVC) fell by 5 % and PEF rose by 25. 5 %. However, PEF recorded with the mini-Wright peak flow meter underestimated PEF by 31 %, giving readings 6. 6 % below sea level values. FVC was lowest in the mornings and did not improve significantly with acclimatisation. Lower PEF values were observed on morning readings and were associated with higher acute mountain sickness scores, although the latter may reflect decreased effort in those with acute mountain sickness. There was no change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) at altitude when measured with the turbine microspirometer. CONCLUSIONS: The cause of the fall in FVC at 5300 m is unknown but {{may be attributed to}} changes in lung blood volume, interstitial lung oedema, or early airways closure. <b>Variable</b> <b>orifice</b> peak flow meters grossly underestimate PEF at altitude and fixed orifice devices are therefore preferable where accurate PEF measurements are required above sea level...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a validation methodology {{of the dynamic}} behavior of an active viscous damper. The damper has two flexible metallic bellows connected to a rigid reservoir filled with fluid. When one of the bellows is connected to a vibrating structure a periodic flow passes through a <b>variable</b> internal <b>orifice</b> and the damping effect is produced. The size of the orifice is adjusted by a controlled linear piezoelectric actuator that positions the conical core into a conical cavity. The device finite element structural model consists {{of the valve body}} and its conical core that are assumed rigid and the flexible bellows are represented by two pistons with elastic suspensions. The flow developed inside the damper is modeled considering the fluid-structure interation, using the Lagrangean-Eulerian formulation. To validate the proposed model a prototype was constructed and experimental tests and numerical simulations are accomplished in the time domain, applying harmonic excitations. The results are compared using curves that relate the damping coefficient with the orifice size and with the input velocity applied at the bellows face. However, for the proper control design and system operation, the direct use of the finite element model becomes unviable due to its high computational time. Then, a reduced second order discrete dynamic model for the damper was developed. The model parameters are identified by analysis in the frequency domain, using impulsive excitation force, for constant and <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> sizes. At low excitation frequencies, the damper prototype behaves like a single degree of freedom system which damping factor changes with the orifice size A fuzzy controller was designed and it generates the orifice reference size associated to the desired damping factor.

In recent years, variable rate application (VRA) technologies {{have made it possible}} to apply pesticides in variable rates across the field. In pesticide application, nozzles play a vital role. In general, pesticides are applied using conventional nozzles. Most conventional nozzles vary flow rates only over a 2 : 1 range when operated within the recommended pressure range due to a fixed spray orifice. Conventional nozzles vary droplet sizes tremendously when there are speed and application rate changes which results in inefficient application.

It consists of an air spring, a <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> valve, and an accumulator. In this conguration, the spring characteristics are provided by the air spring and accumulator, while the <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> valve provides the damping characteristics. The valve is computer regulated according to the innovative control laws that were developed for the pneumatic system. The vibration isolator system is designed to work in the vibration environment that is typically observed in the case of Class 7 and 8 vehicles as dened by the U. S Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration. In order to design a vibration isolator system for the intended application, a benchmarking study was conducted to gain additional insight on OEM vibration isolator systems features and limitations. Based on the insights obtained from this study, the design requirements for the system were dened. This paper presents a methodology of producing a plant model that is based on supplier 2 ̆ 7 s engineering specications and experimental characterization. The plant model includes a complete characterization of nonlinear pressure to volume and eective area to ride height relationships. A detailed design process of selecting and implementing components to optimize system performance is also provided. The plant model was then used to design three semiactive controllers that use position and pressure feedback signals that exploit the nonlinear characterizations to measure direct force generation. The semi-active controllers that were designed for this novel pneumatic vibration isolator system include: a LQI (Linear Quadratic Impulse) optimal controller, Modied Skyhook controller, and a Relative Displacement controller. This vibration isolator system was designed, fabricated, and tested using a prototype electronic height control system.

Among {{the large number of}} commercial flowmeters, only few kinds of sensors are used in these fields. Among them, <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> meters (VOMs) show some valuable characteristics, such as linearity, good dynamic response, and low cost. This paper presents the characterization of a commercial VOM intended for application in respiratory monitoring. Firstly, two nominally identical VOMs were calibrated within ± 10 [*]L·min− 1, to assess their metrological properties. Furthermore, experiments were performed by humidifying the air, to evaluate the influence of vapor condensation on sensor’s performances. The condensation influence was investigated during two long lasting trials (i. e., 4 hours) by delivering 4 [*]L·min− 1 and 8 [*]L·min− 1. Data show that the two VOMs’ responses are linear and their response is comparable (sensitivity difference of 1. 4 %, RMSE of 1. 50 [*]Pa); their discrimination threshold is < 0. 5 [*]L·min− 1, and the settling time is about 66 [*]ms. The condensation within the VOM causes a negligible change in sensor sensitivity and a very slight deterioration of precision.

The current project aims to evaluate the various loading architectures in their ability to quickly and accurately create the desired impedance. The robustness of the loading architectures was tested {{on a wide range of}} pump sizes, speeds, pressures, and displacements. The estimated initial conditions of the loading architectures, such as the orifice areas and line volumes and pressures are very efficient means of converging to the correct discharge pressure.

The DOE revealed the models sensitivity to the normally unknown variables which contributed to large variations in accuracy. However, after analyzing the impact of other variables, an alternate approach was taken. By creating a variant of the simulation, which sets port pressures equal to line pressures, orifice areas can be effectively removed from the equation. In order to compare the performance, ideal valve plates specific to each code variant should be used. This is because arbitrary valve plates may favor one over the other, yielding extraneous conclusions.

5000|$|The PCV valve is a <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> that {{controls}} the flow of crankcase fumes, admixed with fresh air admitted to the crankcase by the breather, into the intake tract.

With the engine running, the restrictor is drawn towards the orifice by manifold vacuum, restricting the opening proportionate {{to the level of}} engine vacuum vs. spring tension. At idle, manifold vacuum is high, but a large amount of extra air would amount to a vacuum leak, causing the engine to run too lean and/or too fast. So at high manifold vacuum, the PCV valve allows only a low flow rate. This is in accordance with the low volume of crankcase fumes generated at low engine speeds. At higher engine speeds, with less manifold vacuum, the PCV valve permits a greater flow rate {{to keep up with the}} greater volume of crankcase fumes; because of the higher engine speed, a greater amount of [...] "extra" [...] air via the PCV system can be tolerated without upsetting the engine's running. At full throttle, very little manifold vacuum is present, so there is little flow through the PCV valve. However, this is the condition under which the maximum volume of crankcase gas is present.

40|$|Resistive loads {{are used}} to train {{respiratory}} muscles in athletes and in rehabilitation of people with pulmonary disease or spinal injuries [1 – 3]. Other studies use external resistive load detection {{as a tool to}} study dyspnoea sensitivity [4]. Resistive work is dependent on ventilation, and different exercise modes, for example walking and cycling place different metabolic demands on the body. A measure of the work performed during breathing can be derived from the product of the volume and pressure change generated during the respiratory cycle. The mechanical work of breathing which includes the elastic and resistive components, defined per litre of ventilation in resting healthy subjects is around 0. 3560. 1 JL 21 while the power generated is around 2. 460. 7 W [5]. The power generated is thus influenced by respiratory rate and volume of air moved. Measuring these parameters often involve using invasive techniques and require an estimate of chest wall compliance [6]. At rest the inspiratory work of breathing is consistently larger than expiratory work. However this changes with exercise when expiration also becomes an active process. Measuring work only during the inspiratory phase of the respiratory cycle provides a simple index of the muscle-driven work irrespective of the expiratory phase. This study aims to use a new non-invasive method to measure the resistive work of breathing and the subsequent power generated (WRI and PRI respectively) while breathing against added resistive loads and explore this relationship with ventilation during sub-maximal exercise, sitting, walking or cycling.

To elucidate the relationships between hydrodynamic factors such as Reynolds number, flow velocity and flow volume and the sound characteristics of cardiac murmurs, we developed an in vitro pulsatile flow model with <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> size and shape (circular 0. 11 cm 2, 0. 24 cm 2, 1. 77 cm 2 and 3. 80 cm 2; oval 0. 24 cm 2, with a ratio of major to minor axis= 2; rectangular 0. 24 cm 2, ratio= 4). Heart sounds were recorded with a new digital system (MCG) with real time spectral analysis and display and averaged over 15 “cardiac” cycles. Mean flow rate ranged from 0. 6 l/min to 6 l/min. Actual instantaneous flow rate was measured using an ultrasonic flow meter for peak flow rates 1. 6 l/min to 16. 8 l/min. Reynolds number ranged from 6820 to 40050. For each orifice, there was an excellent relationship between total integrated sound energy (See figure: integration of intensity (I) and frequency (F) over time (T).) obtained by digital processing and Reynolds number, peak flow velocity and peak flow rate (r= 0. 89 – 0. 97, 0. 89 – 0. 97, 0. 93 –D. 99, P< 0. 001, respectively). The best relationship was obtained for the smallest orifice. Higher sound energies were detected for any given flow volume in asymmetrical orifices, probably due to higher turbulence. For all orifices combined, a correlation was found between peak frequency and peak velocity, but only total sound energywas correlated with peak flow rate (r= 0. 84, P< 0. 0 t). Total integrated sound energy determined digitally is related to peak flow rate; peak velocity and Reynolds number parallel peak sound frequency...|$|R

Applied Engineering in Agriculture, 32 (3), 347 - 352. doi: 10. 13031 /aea. 32. 11428 Variable-rate application continues to gain interest among precision agriculture practitioners {{including the use}} of crop sensor technology for application of nitrogen in grain crops. For {{liquid fertilizer}}s, variable-orifice nozzles are being implemented since they provide a much larger nozzle flow range compared to traditional fixed orifice nozzles. However, understanding the performance of variable-orifice nozzles under different field operating conditions has been limited. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performance of <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> nozzles in support of variable-rate application. Two common variable-orifice nozzles offered by different companies were selected for this study. They were tested over three flow ranges (0. 76 to 1. 89 L/min) with all tests replicated three times. A commercially available 18. 6 -m, wet boom sprayer equipped with 37 nozzle bodies was used. Nozzles were numbered but then randomly assigned a position along the boom. To evaluate the performance of an individual nozzle, three random nozzle locations along the spray boom were established for both sets of nozzles. Therefore, 18 tests per replication were required to include the 3 flow rates, 3 different locations, and 2 nozzle types. Once the desired flow rate test was established, tip flow was measured using SpotOn Sprayer Calibrator technology. Tip flows were recorded and statistical analyses performed to evaluate flow uniformity (CV) across the boom but also detect off-rate errors by individual nozzles and locations across the boom. With the exception of a few nozzles, the uniformity across the spray boom, as defined by the CV, was acceptable for both nozzle types over approximately a 2 : 1 flow range. Both nozzle types were less uniform at the low flow rate. There were three nozzles of each type that resulted in unacceptable flow errors in multiple tests. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers...|$|R
40|$|External {{gear pumps}} {{are the most}} widely {{employed}} source of power in hydraulic applications, allowing good performance and low manufacturing costs. The present paper reports the description of a numerical model for the simulation of these kind of machines, developed by the authors. The model has been implemented using the software AMESim®, introducing new in-house C++ models, with the main aim of an accurate prediction of the pressure ripple at the delivery port and the calculation the flow rate time course through the pump. In fact the reduction of flow pulsations {{is one of the}} crucial targets in the development of these machines. The fluid dynamic model of the pump is based on a finite volumes framework: each chamber presents uniform fluid proprieties and is connected with the adjoining ones by <b>variable</b> <b>orifices.</b> The pump is described by the interaction between a fluid dynamic model, that predicts the instantaneous pressures and the flow rates between the chambers, with a geometrical sub-model for the evaluation of the actual values of the variable volumes (defined by teeth, housing, and side wear plates) and the throat areas, as functions of the shaft angular position. This paper reports a deep description of the fluid dynamic model and a comparison between its numerical results and data available from experiments, showing how a correct evaluation of the flow when the chambers expand (and oil is pushed from the supply tank) or decrease (and oil is ejected into the outlet port) allows a good prediction of the pump characteristics. The results reported in the paper show how the model can be a powerful tool for design and development of external gear pumps, e. g. it easily allows the prediction of the maximum and minimum pressure reached inside the teeth space volumes, giving important information to prevent cavitation and damages as well as to reduce the pump noise. Moreover the simulation environment easily allows the evaluation of the pump behaviour when it works in a given hydraulic system...|$|R

A simula-tion model was developed to predict the time distribution of orifice flows, the distribution of infiltrated water across a field, and runoff rates.

40|$|The leakage {{reduction}} {{problem as}} a whole is complex and requires co-ordinated actions in different areas of water network management, such as: direct detection and repair of existing bursts, general pipe rehabilitation programmes and operational pressure control. Water companies undertake a mixture of these complimentary actions. General pipe rehabilitation is the most costly and long term action, but is undertaken to improve a number of different factors including leakage and water quality. Operational pressure control is a cost-effective action for reducing leakage over whole sub-networks, and for reducing the risk of further leaks by smoothing pressure variations and is the subject of ongoing research. Detection and repair actions are targeted at sub-networks where bursts are present. Benefits of quick burst repair include reduced water losses, reduced disruption to traffic, reduced consequent losses (e. g. from flooding), and also reduced disruption to customers' supplies, which is an important water industry performance measure. The existing methods typically use passive identification approach whilst the presented approach is based on the active identification procedure. The proposed burst location algorithm is based on comparing data by means of statistical analysis from a simple field experiment with results of water network simulation. An extended network hydraulic simulator is used to model pressure dependent leakage terms. The presence of a burst changes the flow pattern and also pressure at network nodes, which may be used to estimate the burst size and its location. The influence of such random factors as demand flows and background leakage on the process of burst detection is also considered. The field experiment is an extended fixed and <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> (e-FAVOR) test. During this test inlet pressure is being stepped up and down and the following variables are measured: inlet flow, inlet pressure (head) and pressure at a number of selected sensitive nodes. The method consists of three stages and uses two different models; one is inlet flow model (IFM) to represent the total inlet flow and another is the extended hydraulic model to simulate different burst locations. Initially the presence of a potential burst is investigated. If this is confirmed values of the demand, background leakage flow and burst flow in IFM are subsequently estimated. These are used to identify the burst site at the third stage of the method. The approach has been validated by solving a practical case study with correct diagnosis of the existing problems...|$|R
