25|$|In {{practice}} {{this type of}} frequency synthesizer cannot operate over a very wide range of frequencies, because the comparator will have a limited bandwidth and may suffer from aliasing problems. This would lead to false locking situations, or an inability to lock at all. In addition, {{it is hard to}} make a high frequency VCO that operates over a very wide range. This is due to several factors, but the primary restriction is the limited capacitance range of <b>varactor</b> diodes. However, in most systems where a synthesizer is used, we are not after a huge range, but rather a finite number over some defined range, such as a number of radio channels in a specific band.|$|E
