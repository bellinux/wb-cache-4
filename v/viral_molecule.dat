40|$|Years after {{infection}} with hepatitis B virus, chimpanzees may have {{manifestations of the}} carrier state as described in man. In addition to serologic evidence for persistent viral infection, percutaneous liver biopsy specimens showed hepatitis B virus surface antigen in the cytoplasm and hepatitis B virus core antigen in the nucleus. Four carrier animals had portal inflammatory reaction as seen in human chronic persistent hepatitis. Viral DNA was demonstrated in nucleic acid extracts of liver biopsy specimens by molecular hybridization to cloned plasmic pA 01 containing hepatitis B virus DNA sequences. Although a <b>viral</b> <b>molecule</b> of length greater than the putative virus was identified, it {{did not appear to}} represent integration of viral DNA into the host genome. The chimpanzee model may serve as a means to study the mechanism of hepatitis B viral persistence and progression to chronic liver disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has substantially modified the {{clinical history and}} epidemiology of HIV infection with an important decline in infective causes of death {{and an increase in}} non-infective comorbidities particularly in cardiovascular complications. HIV infection has been related to an increased cardiovascular risk due to the presence of three factors: classic cardiovascular risk factors (shared with the general population), HIV infection itself (indirectly due to the inflammation and directly due to <b>viral</b> <b>molecule)</b> and ART-related chronic metabolic alterations. We describe a peculiar case of metabolic alteration in an HIV infected patient on ART with particular attention to the diagnosis and therapeutic aspects. Giving the higher cardiovascular risk of this specific population it is advisable that the clinician performs a frequent re-assessment of risk factors and cardiovascular organ damage. An early detection of metabolic alteration must lead to an aggressive specific therapy; this must be done by taking care of the HIV-infected subject fragility and the interactions with ART...|$|E
40|$|While as {{yet there}} is no vaccine against HIV/AIDS, the results of the phase III Thai trial (RV 144) have been {{encouraging}} and suggest that further improvements of the prime/boost vaccine combination of a poxvirus and protein are needed. With this aim, in this investigation we have generated derivatives of the candidate vaccinia virus vaccine vector NYVAC with potentially improved functions. This has been achieved by the re-incorporation into the virus genome of two host range genes, K 1 L and C 7 L, in conjunction with the removal of the immunomodulatory <b>viral</b> <b>molecule</b> B 19, an antagonist of type I interferon action. These novel virus vectors, referred to as NYVAC-C-KC and NYVAC-C-KC-DB 19 R, have acquired relevant biological characteristics, giving higher levels of antigen expression in infected cells, replication-competency in human keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts, activation of selective host cell signal transduction pathways, and limited virus spread in tissues. Importantly, these replication-competent viruses have been demonstrated to maintain a highly attenuated phenotype...|$|E

40|$|When NIH/ 3 T 3 mouse {{fibroblasts}} {{were infected}} with the Moloney strain of murine leukemia virus, part of the <b>viral</b> genome RNA <b>molecules</b> were detected in polyribosomes of the infected cells early in the infectious cycle. The binding appears to be specific, since we could demonstrate the release of viral RNA from polyribosomes with EDTA. Moreover, when infection occurred {{in the presence of}} cycloheximide, most <b>viral</b> RNA <b>molecules</b> were detected in the free cytoplasm. Size analysis on polyribosomal <b>viral</b> RNA <b>molecules</b> indicated that two size class molecules, 38 S and 23 S, are present in polyribosomes at 3 h after infection. Analysis of the polyriboadenylate [poly(rA) ] content of viral RNA extracted from infected polyribosomes demonstrated that such molecules bind with greatest abundance at 3 h after infection, as has been detected with total <b>viral</b> RNA. No <b>molecules</b> lacking poly(rA) stretches could be detected in polyribosomes. Furthermore, when a similar analysis was performed on unbound molecules present in the free cytoplasm, identical results were obtained. We conclude that no selection towards poly(rA) -containing <b>viral</b> <b>molecules</b> is evident on binding to polyribosomes. These findings suggest that the incoming viral genome of the Moloney strain of murine leukemia virus may serve as a messenger for the synthesis of one or more virus-specific proteins early after infection of mouse fibroblasts...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} rifampin on the {{replication}} of vaccinia DNA was studied in mouse L cells by a cytochemical techinque and by alkaline sucrose sedimentation analysis of newly synthesized <b>viral</b> DNA <b>molecules.</b> By {{the use of}} a fluorescent DNA-binding compound (Hoechst 33258), the sequential appearance, size, and location of the viral "factories" in rifampin-treated, virus-infected cells were found to be indistinguishable from those observed in untreated, infected cells. Sedimentation analysis in alkaline scurose gradients of the <b>viral</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> labeled in pulse-chase experiments showed that formation of small fragments, elongation into "intermediate"-sized molecules, and maturation into full-length viral DNA and, finally, into cross-linked <b>viral</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> occurred in the absence or presence of rifampin.

40|$|Viral {{infection}} {{leads to}} induction of pattern-recognition receptor signaling, {{which leads to}} interferon regulatory factor (IRF) activation and ultimately interferon (IFN) production. To establish infection, many viruses have strategies to evade the innate immunity. For the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which causes chronic infection in the liver, the evasion strategy remains uncertain. We now show that HBV polymerase (Pol) blocks IRF signaling, indicating that HBV Pol is the <b>viral</b> <b>molecule</b> that effectively counteracts host innate immune response. In particular, HBV Pol inhibits TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK 1) /IkappaB kinase-epsilon (IKKepsilon), the effector kinases of IRF signaling. Intriguingly, HBV Pol inhibits TBK 1 /IKKepsilon activity by disrupting the interaction between IKKepsilon and DDX 3 DEAD box RNA helicase, which was recently shown to augment TBK 1 /IKKepsilon activity. This unexpected role of HBV Pol may explain how HBV evades innate immune response in the early phase of the infection. A therapeutic implication of this work is that a strategy {{to interfere with the}} HBV Pol-DDX 3 interaction might lead to the resolution of life-long persistent infection...|$|E
40|$|Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) {{chitinase}} A (ChiA) is {{a protein}} which promotes the final liquefaction of infected host larvae. The potential of this <b>viral</b> <b>molecule</b> {{as a new}} tool for insect control is explored here. The ChiA gene was isolated from the AcMNPV genome by PCR and expressed in E. coli. The recombinant protein, purified by affinity chromatography, showed both exo- and endo-chitinase activities and produced perforations on the peritrophic membrane (PM) of Bombyx mori larvae which increased in number and in size, in a dose-dependent manner. This structural alteration resulted into a significant increase of PM permeability to methylene blue and to the small neuropeptide proctolin. When the fifth instar larvae of B. mori were fed on a artificial diet supplemented with the recombinant ChiA, 100 % mortality was observed at a dose of 1 microg/g of larval body weight (LW), while at sub-lethal doses of 0. 56 microg/g LW, a reduced larval growth was recorded. These results indicate that AcMNPV-ChiA may offer interesting new opportunities for pest control...|$|E

Methods: Using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and hepG 2 cells system, three experiments were setup: 1) cells treated with amylase or lactoferrin then infected with HCV; 2) HCV treated with amylase or lactoferrin then used to infect the cells; and 3) HCV infected cells were treated with amylase or lactoferrin. RNA was extracted, RT-PCR and nested PCR were run, in addition to immune-staining the cells to localize the <b>viral</b> <b>molecule</b> within the cells foci. Results: Camel milk-amylase and lactoferrin were in vitro tested the ability to inhibit the HCV entry and replication inside the human peripheral blood and hepG 2. Amylase could not able to inhibit nor blocking the viral replication. However, lactoferrin demonstrate a clear ability to inhibit the viral entry into both cells system when pre-interact with the virus, but fault to protect the cells before infection. The virus replication inside the cells was completely blocked only when the infected cells were treated with lactoferrin. Conclusions: Camel lactoferrin was demonstrated a remarked in vitro ability to completely inhibit the HCV entry into PBMC, hepG 2 and replication inside those cells system...|$|E

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) viruses express proteins (HCMV gp 68 and gp 34; HSV- 1 gE-gI) that function as Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) by binding to the Fc regions of human IgG.

40|$|The Nef protein {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type I (HIV- 1) is an important determinant for the onset of AIDS disease. The self-association properties of HIV- 1 Nef are analyzed by chemical cross-linking, dynamic light scattering, equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation, and NMR spectroscopy. The experimental data show that the HIV- 1 Nef core domain forms stable homo-dimers and trimers in solution, but not higher oligomers. These Nef homomers are not covalently linked by disulfide bridges, and the equilibrium between these forms {{is dependent on the}} Nef concentration. We further provide the molecular basis for the Nef core dimers and trimers obtained by analysis of crystallographic models. Oligomerization of biological polypeptides is a common tool used to trigger events in cellular signaling and endocytosis, both of which are targeted by Nef. The quaternary structure of Nef may be of physiological importance and may help to connect its cellular targets or to increase affinity of the <b>viral</b> <b>molecule</b> for its ligands. The herein described models for Nef dimers and trimers will allow further mutational studies to elucidate their role in vivo. These results provide novel insight into the structural and functional relationships of this important viral protein. Moreover, the oligomer interface may represent a novel target for the design of antiviral agents...|$|E
40|$|Some Herpes-, Pox- and Irido-virus genes (and the {{controversial}} Stealth virus gene) share significant nucleotide sequences with vertebrate chemokine receptors (CKR) genes. In some instances the viral reading frame {{is the same}} as in the CKRs, giving rise to similar protein products. In other cases the reading frame is different and the viral protein product is not CKR-like. In yet other instances the segmental alignments between CKR genes and viral genes are more limited. In this article we discuss in detail only the more highly significant alignments. We propose the hypothesis that both CKR and CKR-like viral genes originated from a common ancestral gene. This older ancestor may have differentiated into two sequences, one giving rise to the group of extant CKR genes with relatively low levels of similarity with viruses, and the other to the other extant CKRs and the CKR-like viral products. The two extant proteins of the CKR and viral groups which share the maximum amino acid identities are the human CCR 3 and the E 1 of the Equid herpes virus 2, with a continuous alignment coverage of 73 % of the <b>viral</b> <b>molecule.</b> It is thus proposed that the ancestral sequence giving rise to both CKRs and CKR-like viral products may have been similar to the extant human CCR 3 and E 1 Equid herpes virus 2...|$|E
40|$|Membrane glycoproteins of the {{secretory}} pathway that cannot adopt {{their native}} conformation are targeted for dislocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane for subsequent degradation by the cytosolic proteasome. This thesis investigates factors influencing the catalyzed destruction of MHC class I molecules by the HCMV glycoproteins US 2 and US 11 and {{the degradation of}} the model substrate TCRuc. The ER chaperone calnexin, implicated in glycoprotein folding, and the ER chaperones protein disulfide isomerase and Erolu, implicated in substrate disulfide bond formation, were examined for their roles in protein dislocation. By targeting these ER chaperones with siRNA constructs, the cellular levels of these ER chaperones were significantly reduced. Nevertheless, the rates of degradation of TCRct and the US 2 - and US 11 -catalyzed destruction of MHC class I molecules were similar to wild-type cells. The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) transcriptionally regulates ER chaperones and is essential in S. cerevisiae for efficient degradation of model ER substrates. In mammalian cells, neither the ATF 6 -dependent response nor the IREltc-XBP- 1 -dependent response of the UPR {{was found to be}} essential for efficient degradation of TCRc, US 2 -, or US 11 -catalyzed destruction of MHC class I molecules. Interestingly, the ATF 6 response, but not the IRElct-XBP- 1 response, is essential for cellular viability. To better define the substrate requirements of US 2 and US 11, the 30 residue cytoplasmic tail of MHC class I molecules was mutated. US 2 can degrade MHC class I molecules with a cytoplasmic tail shortened to 10 residues or lengthened, by the fusion of GFP to the C-terminus, to several hundred residues. (cont.) In contrast, US 11 only degrades MHC class I molecules possessing a cytoplasmic tail of 30 amino acids. These data support a model that US 2 and US 11 act through distinct degradative mechanisms. To define modular functional domains of US 2 and US 11, lumenal or cytoplasmic domains were reciprocally exchanged between the viral molecules and between each <b>viral</b> <b>molecule</b> and their degradation substrate, the HLA-A 2 heavy chain. Most chimeric molecules were not targeted for degradation when expressed alone or with their complementary construct. However, the US 11 molecule in which the cytoplasmic tail was exchanged for that of HLA-A 2 was rapidly dislocated from the ER to the cytosol. In addition, lumenal GFP possessing the transmembrane domain of US 11 and the cytoplasmic tail of HLA-A 2 was rapidly dislocated from the ER to the cytosol. Mutation of the critical glutamine residue in the transmembrane domain of US 11 essential for destruction of MHC class I molecules resulted in a marked stabilization of the GFP construct. by Patrick J.

40|$|We {{examine the}} limits on viral {{composition}} that are set by the electrostatic interactions effected by the charge on the viral proteins, the single-stranded <b>viral</b> RNA <b>molecule</b> and monovalent salt ions in the solution. Within the mean-field model of viral energetics we demonstrate the prime importance of the salt concentration for the assembly of a virus. We find that the encapsidation of the <b>viral</b> RNA <b>molecule</b> is thermodynamically suppressed in solutions with high concentrations of monovalent salt. This effect is significantly less important in viruses with proteins whose charge distribution protrudes into {{the interior of the}} capsid, leading to an increase in the stability of such viruses in solutions with high salt concentrations. The delocalization of positive charge on the capsid protein arms thus profoundly increases reliability of viral assembly in high-salt solutions...|$|R
40|$|The {{patterns}} and sites of integration of adenovirus type 12 (Ad 12) DNA were determined in three lines of Ad 12 -transformed hamster cells {{and in two}} lines of Ad 12 -induced hamster tumor cells. The results of a detailed analysis can be summarized as follows. (i) All cell lines investigated contained multiple copies (3 to 22 genome equivalents per cell in different lines) of the entire Ad 12 genome. In addition, fragments of Ad 12 DNA also persisted separately in non-stoichiometric amounts. (ii) All Ad 12 DNA copies were integrated into cellular DNA. Free <b>viral</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> did not occur. The terminal regions of Ad 12 DNA were linked to cellular DNA. The internal parts of the integrated viral genomes, and perhaps the entire viral genome, remained colinear with virion DNA. (iii) Except for line HA 12 / 7, there were fewer sites of integration than Ad 12 DNA molecules persisting. This finding suggested either that viral DNA was integrated at identical sites in repetitive DNA or, more likely, that {{one or a few}} <b>viral</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> were amplified upon integration together with the adjacent cellular DNA sequences, leading to a serial arrangement of <b>viral</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> separated by cellular DNA sequences. Likewise, in the Ad 12 -induced hamster tumor lines (CLAC 1 and CLAC 3), viral DNA was linked to repetitive cellular sequences. Serial arrangement of Ad 12 DNA molecules in these lines was not likely. (iv) In general, true tandem integration with integrated <b>viral</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> directly abutting each other was not found. Instead, the data suggested that the integrated <b>viral</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> were separated by cellular or rearranged viral DNA sequences. (v) The results of hybridization experiments, in which a highly specific probe (143 -base pair DNA fragment) derived from the termini of Ad 12 DNA was used, were not consistent with models of integration involving true tandem integration of Ad 12 DNA or covalent circularization of Ad 12 DNA before insertion into the cellular genome. (vi) Evidence was presented that a small segment at the termini of the integrated Ad 12 DNA in cell lines HA 12 / 7, T 637, and A 2497 - 3 was repeated several times. The exact structures of these repeat units remained to be determined. The occurrence of these units might reflect the mechanism of amplification of viral and cellular sequences in transformed cell lines...|$|R

However, since CD 21 -negative cells {{have been reported to}} be infectible with EBV, additional interactions between <b>viral</b> and cellular <b>molecules</b> seem to be probable. Based on a recombinant genomic EBV plasmid, we deleted the gene that encodes the viral glycoprotein BLLF 1. We tested the ability of the viral mutant to infect different lymphoid and epithelial cell lines. Primary human B cells, lymphoid cell lines, and nearly all of the epithelial cell lines that are susceptible to wild-type EBV infection could also be successfully infected with the viral mutant in vitro, although the efficiency of infection with BLLF 1 -negative virus was clearly lower than the one observed with wild-type EBV. Our studies show that the interaction between BLLF 1 and CD 21 is not absolutely required for the infection of lymphocytes and epithelial cells, indicating that <b>viral</b> <b>molecules</b> other than BLLF 1 can mediate the binding of EBV to its target cells. In this context, our results further suggest the hypothesis that additional cellular molecules, apart from CD 21, allow virus entry into these cells...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBaculoviruses elicit the {{formation}} of a nuclear domain, called the virogenic stroma, in which viral DNA replication and nucleocapsid assembly occur. We had previously reported that nuclear focus formation of a transcriptional activator, IE 1, is triggered by its binding to a viral DNA element, hr, and predicted that this hr-induced IE 1 focus is an initial scaffold for the virogenic stroma. However, LEF 3, a component of the virogenic stroma, did not localize to the IE 1 foci. In exploring a mediator for its localization, we found that a baculovirus DNA helicase (P 143), in combination with IE 1 and hr, induced a subnuclear structure to which LEF 3 localized and also that another component of the virogenic stroma, DBP, is able to localize to this structure.

40|$|Viruses are obligate {{intracellular}} pathogens whose biological success {{depends upon}} replication and packaging of viral genomes, and transmission of progeny viruses to new hosts. The biological success of herpesviruses {{is enhanced by}} their ability to reproduce their genomes without producing progeny viruses or killing the host cells, a process called latency. Latency permits a herpesvirus to remain undetected in its animal host for decades while maintaining the potential to reactivate, or switch, to a productive life cycle when host conditions are conducive to generating viral progeny. Direct interactions between many host and <b>viral</b> <b>molecules</b> are implicated in controlling herpesviral reactivation, suggesting complex biological networks that control the decision.

In all five clones, viral sequences were found that could be assigned to a common integration site, as they were joined to the cellular DNA in the same fashion in every instance. However, the sequences comprised between these points differed markedly from clone to clone, as if cell propagation had been accompanied by amplification or recombination or both within the viral insertion. When the clones were compared, no correlation could be found between the abundance, or the organization, of the integrated viral sequences and the amount, or the nature, of the free <b>viral</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> produced during induction.

Transformed rat cells contained, in addition to integrated viral genomes, 20 to 50 copies of nonintegrated viral DNA equivalents per cell (average). "Free" <b>viral</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> were also found in cells transformed by the ts-a and ts- 8 polyoma mutants and kept at 33 C.

KSHV infection displays two alternative life cycles, {{referred to as the}} latent and lytic or productive cycle. Previously, we have reported that the replication and transcription activator (RTA), a major lytic cycle transactivator, contributes to the development of KSHV latency by inducing latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) expression during early stages of infection by targeting RBP-J, the master regulator of the Notch signaling pathway. Here, we generated a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) KSHV recombinant virus with a deletion of the RBP-J site within the LANA promoter to evaluate the function of the RBP-J cognate site in establishing primary latent infection. The results showed that genetic disruption of the RBP-J binding site within the KSHV LANA promoter led to enhanced expression of the KSHV-encoded immediate early RTA, resulting in an increase in lytic replication during primary infection of human periph-eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

Here, we generated a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) KSHV recombinant virus with a deletion of the RBP-Jκ site within the LANA promoter to evaluate the function of the RBP-Jκ cognate site in establishing primary latent infection. The results showed that genetic disruption of the RBP-Jκ binding site within the KSHV LANA promoter led to enhanced expression of the KSHV-encoded immediate early RTA, resulting in an increase in lytic replication during primary infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This system provides a powerful tool for use in indentifying additional cellular and <b>viral</b> <b>molecules</b> involved in LANA-mediated latency maintenance during the early stages of KSHV infection...|$|R
40|$|Antitumor CTL are {{generated}} by immunization of H- 2 b mice with Friend erythroleukemia virus complex (FV) ~ or with syngeneic FV-induced tumor cells (1 - 3). These effector cells can recognize and lyse only those cells expressing cellsurface antigens of both FV and a class I MHC molecule of the H- 2 b baplotype. Previous studies (2) indicated {{that only the}} H- 2 D b and not the H- 2 K b molecule can participate {{in the formation of}} the target structure(s) recognized by these CTL, but the <b>viral</b> <b>molecule(s)</b> remain to be identified. Viral proteins that appear on the surface of infected cells are encoded by the env and gag genes of each of the two component viruses of FV, helper Friend murine leukemia virus (FMuLV) and replication-defective spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) (4, 5). These molecules are the FMuLV env-gene encoded glycoproteins gp 70 and pl 5 (E), and the glycosylated gag membrane proteins gP 85 and its precursor gP 95 (6); present in lesser amounts on the cell surface are the SFFV env product gp 52 and gagencoded protein p 45 (7). Several investigators have used a variety of indirect approaches to identify the MuLV-encoded molecule(s) recognized by CTL...|$|R
40|$|Cytolytic T {{lymphocytes}} (CTL) specific for the virus-induced and leukemia-associated Friend, Moloney, Rauscher (FMR) antigen {{are easily}} {{detected in the}} spleens of primary and secondary stimulated H- 2 b or H- 2 d mice. They react, respectively, with H- 2 Db + FMR and H- 2 Kd + FMR; Dd and Kb never being involved. On the other hand, recombinant (KbDd) mice are relatively low responders that produce CTL only after secondary stimulation. Competition and blocking experiments with monospecific anti-H- 2 antibodies have demonstrated that on the same H- 2 b tumor cells, C 57 BL/ 6 (H- 2 b) lymphocytes recognize Db + FMR, whereas B 10. A(5 R) lymphocytes recognize Kb + FMR, the restriction cannot, therefore be explained by a specific association of <b>viral</b> <b>molecules</b> with certain H- 2 products. The CTL response of (B 10 X 5 R) F 1 hybrids is (a) easily detected in primary reaction, the high responder anti-FMR phenotype being dominant and (b) directed against Db + FMR, F 1 mice being low responder against Kb + FMR like the B 10 parent. These results suggest that a D region-associated immune response gene controls the cell- mediated anti-FMR reaction, the best available H- 2 + FMR antigenic association being chosen by CTL precursors...|$|R
