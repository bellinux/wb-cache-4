40|$|<b>Venture</b> <b>Capital</b> firms (VCs), {{compared}} with other sources of financing, {{are known to be}} a value-adding source of finance for high-growth entrepreneurial firms. <b>Venture</b> <b>capital</b> has transitioned from a local to an international subject in recent years. In this thesis, I address three important aspects of the international <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> research area. In the first essay, I answer these questions: do <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> firms decide to invest in a cross-border company based solely on their own international experience, or do they also decide based on other <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> firms’ behaviour in investing in that country? I address these questions by investigating vicarious and experiential learning in the <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> context, focusing on US cross-border <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> investment data from 2000 to 2013. The analysis indicates that, on average, <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> firms use both experiential and vicarious learning strategies in making their cross-border investment decisions. Moreover, the effect of experiential learning is greater than that of vicarious learning, and a <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> firm’s size moderates this effect. In the second essay, I answer this question: do government <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> funds crowd-in or crowd-out international private <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> investment? The crowding-in effect arises when international private <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> benefits from government subsidies through the enhancement of an entrepreneurial ecosystem and investment syndication. The crowding-out effect arises when government <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> competes with private <b>venture</b> <b>capital,</b> bidding up deal prices and lowering returns, thereby spurring local private venture capitalists to invest internationally. I examine data from 26 countries from 1998 to 2013. The analysis indicates that, on average, more mixed-structured government <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> investments than pure-structured government investments in a country crowds-in domestic and foreign private venture capitalists internationally. Moreover, the effect of both structures is greater on domestic private venture capitalists than on foreign ones. In the third essay, I investigate whether government <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> practices in Canada promote a robust entrepreneurial ecosystem, by analyzing the effect of these practices on domestic and cross-border <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> investments by private <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> firms separately. I research the following two questions in parallel: a) Does Canadian government <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> investment attract private <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> firms to invest in the domestic market? b) Does Canadian government <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> investment lead to, or prevent, domestic private <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> firms from investing in other countries? I find that Canadian government <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> investment has no measurable impact on private <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> firms’ decisions to invest in the domestic market. I also find that certain of the Canadian government’s <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> programs have displaced private <b>venture</b> <b>capital,</b> although with negligible impact, towards cross-border VC markets, primarily to the United States...|$|R
