Fearon and Bales (1995) state that “the opportunity to increase profits through more effective purchasing probably is greater in the buying of services than in the purchase of goods. ” A logical step in overall cost reduction strategies {{is to focus on}} <b>purchased</b> <b>services.</b> A review of the available literature revealed a number of strategies that organizations can use to reduce the cost of <b>purchased</b> <b>services,</b> with each strategy producing varying results. Some potential strategies include: exploiting volume aggregation; committing to supplier development and relationship management; adopting integrated sourcing and procurement strategies that increase an organization’s control of services purchases; recognizing the differences in complexity between purchasing materials and <b>purchasing</b> <b>services</b> to assign the most appropriate supply professionals to each category; exploring opportunities to participate in group/consortium buying; potentially outsourcing {{some or all of the}} responsibilities of <b>purchasing</b> <b>services</b> to a third party; and using reverse auctions. Each buying organization should carefully select the cost reduction strategies it will use based on its particular needs, strategic goals and competencies...|$|R

We find that both the broad and narrow measure of international outsourcing of material inputs to low income countries are not significantly related to total factor productivity growth. In contrast, there is significant impact of <b>purchased</b> <b>services</b> from abroad on TFP growth. In particular, <b>purchased</b> <b>services</b> from abroad account for 20  percent of total factor productivity growth in the manufacturing sector in the selected OECD countries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects that}} <b>purchased</b> <b>services</b> and imported intermediate materials have on the labour demand for different skills in the manufacturing sector. We derive and estimate a factor demand system based on the generalised Box-Cox cost function nesting both the normalised quadratic and the translog functional form. We find that the impacts of output and capital growth are more important in explaining the demand for heterogeneous labour than substitution effects between labour and non-labour inputs. Similarly, {{the increasing use of}} both imported materials and <b>purchased</b> <b>services</b> is rather a consequence of output growth than input substitution. [...] Outsourcing of services,intermediate imports,heterogeneous labour,Box-Cox cost function...|$|R
