2500|$|The Tweedie {{convergence}} theorem {{provides a}} hypothetical {{explanation for the}} wide manifestation of fluctuation scaling and 1/f noise. It requires, in essence, that any exponential dispersion model that asymptotically manifests a variance to mean power law will be required express a <b>variance</b> <b>function</b> that comes within the domain of attraction of a Tweedie model. [...] Almost all distribution functions with finite cumulant generating functions qualify as exponential dispersion models and most exponential dispersion models manifest variance functions of this form. [...] Hence many probability distributions have variance functions that express this asymptotic behavior, and [...] the Tweedie distributions become foci of convergence {{for a wide range}} of data types.|$|E

There are many forms of non-parametric smoothing methods to help estimate the function [...] An interesting approach is to also look at a non-parametric <b>variance</b> <b>function,</b> [...] A non-parametric <b>variance</b> <b>function</b> allows one to look at the mean function {{as it relates to the}} <b>variance</b> <b>function</b> and notice patterns in the data.|$|E

One is led therefore to replacing finiteness of computations by "finitely generated" in the sense of recurrence relationships. In fact it turns out that there is a natural definition in terms of the exponential model which is that the first and second derivative of the cumulant generating function, K, lie on a polynomial variety. This generalises recent polynomial conditions on <b>variance</b> <b>functions.</b> This is satisfied by many examples and has applications to, for example, exact expressions for <b>variance</b> <b>functions</b> and saddle-point approximations...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} class of semiparametric {{functional}} regression models to describe the influence of vector-valued covariates on a sample of response curves.
