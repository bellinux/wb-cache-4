5|$|The data/messages {{from the}} {{aircraft}} are transmitted by the aircraft's Satellite Data Unit (SDU) and relayed <b>via</b> <b>satellite</b> to a ground station, {{where they are}} routed to other communication networks to reach their destination. Messages may also {{be sent to the}} aircraft, in reverse order. When passing through the satellite, the signals are amplified and translated in frequency—mixed with the signal from an oscillator in the satellite, leaving the satellite at the combined frequency. Transmissions from the aircraft are made on one of several channels (frequencies) near 1.6GHz, combined with frequency of the satellite's oscillator, and transmitted to the GES at the combined frequency (one of several channels near 3.6GHz). The ground station then translates the received signal before it reaches equipment to be processed. The ground station keeps a log of transmissions and some data about them.|$|E
