50|$|The engine {{concept was}} {{a topic of}} much {{interest}} in the period 1930-1960, {{and a number of}} commercially available units were developed. These first generation free-piston engines were without exception opposed piston engines, in which the two pistons were mechanically linked to ensure symmetric motion. The free-piston engines provided some advantages over conventional technology, including compactness and a <b>vibration-free</b> design.|$|E
50|$|Klement Gottwald's {{body was}} {{exhibited}} in {{the centre of the}} Mausoleum in a glazed sarcophagus. The lid had built-in lights with small mirrors.

The car's maximum speed over level ground {{was said to be}} 50-55 mph.|$|E
50|$|Many {{precision}} {{industrial processes}} cannot take place if the machinery is being affected by vibration. For example, {{the production of}} semiconductor wafers requires that the machines used for the photolithography steps be used in an essentially <b>vibration-free</b> environment or the sub-micrometre features will be blurred. Active vibration control is now also commercially available for reducing vibration in helicopters, offering better comfort with less weight than traditional passive technologies.|$|E

50|$|A {{wide variety}} of smaller Stirling cryocoolers are commercially {{available}} for tasks such as the cooling of electronic sensors and sometimes microprocessors. For this application, Stirling cryocoolers are the highest-performance technology available, due {{to their ability to}} lift heat efficiently at very low temperatures.

5000|$|The turbine spins on simple sleeve {{bearings}} for <b>vibration-free</b> running. Its simplicity {{offers the potential}} for long life, and because no combustion contaminants enter engine oil, no oil changes are considered necessary. The 1963 Turbine's engine generated [...] and an instant [...] of torque at stall speed, making it good for 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in 12 seconds at an ambient temperature of 85 F—it can sprint quicker if the ambient air was cooler and denser.|$|E
50|$|In most types, {{the linear}} {{movement}} of the piston is converted to a rotating movement via a connecting rod and a crankshaft or by a swashplate or other suitable mechanism. A flywheel {{is often used to}} ensure smooth rotation or to store energy to carry the engine through an un-powered part of the cycle. The more cylinders a reciprocating engine has, generally, the more <b>vibration-free</b> (smoothly) it can operate. The power of a reciprocating engine is proportional to the volume of the combined pistons' displacement.|$|E

50|$|The {{spin and}} dip coating methods are simple methods for {{nanoparticle}} deposition. They are useful tools especially in creating self-assembled layers and films where {{the packing density}} isn't critical. Accurate and <b>vibration-free</b> sample withdrawal speeds {{can be used to}} have control over the film thickness. Creating high density monolayers is typically very difficult since the methods are lacking the packing density control. Also, the volume of nanoparticle suspension required for both spin coating and dip coating is rather big which may be an issue when using expensive nanoparticle materials.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, Roelf Marx, as {{quoted in}} Cairncross and Pope and Cairncross, former {{curator of the}} Klerksdorp Museum, reports that he was misquoted {{regarding}} these objects. Marx was quoted in popular articles {{as saying that the}} objects rotated by themselves in <b>vibration-free</b> display cases in the Klerksdorp Museum. Instead, Roelf Marx stated that they rotated because of the numerous earth tremors generated by underground blasting in local gold mining. Similarly, inquiries of scientists, who studied these objects, have found that the claims that NASA found these objects to be either perfectly balanced, unnatural, or puzzling are unsubstantiated.|$|E
50|$|The German Type 212 class, also Italian Todaro class, is {{a highly}} {{advanced}} design of non-nuclear submarine developed by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG (HDW) for the German and Italian navies. It features diesel propulsion and an additional air-independent propulsion (AIP) system using Siemens proton exchange membrane (PEM) compressed hydrogen fuel cells. The submarines can operate at high speed on diesel power or switch to the AIP system for silent slow cruising, staying submerged {{for up to three}} weeks without surfacing and with little exhaust heat. The system is also said to be <b>vibration-free,</b> extremely quiet and virtually undetectable.|$|E
50|$|Normal {{operation}} in an SLR camera involves flipping the mirror {{up out of}} the light-path just before the shutter opens, and then returning it when the shutter closes (although very early SLR's required the shutter to be cocked for the mirror to return). This causes vibration of the camera, particularly when the mirror slaps into the top of the mirror box. This vibration quickly dies away so the most motion blur is actually seen with short shutter times that capture multiple 'swings' of the vibration (shutter speeds of 1/2 to 1/60 second are often affected by this). While longer exposures will capture all of the vibrations, the exposure will be dominated by light captured when the camera is <b>vibration-free</b> (assuming a steady mount).|$|E
50|$|In 1908, the {{original}} tower was demolished {{and a new}} reinforced three-story late Gothic Revival concrete tower, 20 feet 6 inches wide and 32 feet 8 inches high was constructed in its place. The concrete construction of the tower was chosen specifically to provide {{the maximum amount of}} stability and durability in the event of high winds. The tower has a crenelated top and a cornice containing dentils. The windows are double-hung sash with a shallow recessed arch over the windows on the first and second floors.The new tower provided the durable weather-resistant, <b>vibration-free</b> environment necessary for accurate instrument readings. The first floor of the tower contains the director's office. The weather bureau is on the second floor and a laboratory and access to the roof are found on the third floor.

5000|$|It is {{a logical}} {{extension}} of the compound engine (described above) to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency. The result is the multiple-expansion engine. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple- and quadruple-expansion engines respectively. These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage. As with the double-expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders {{may be used for}} the low-pressure stage. Multiple-expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing [...] "system" [...] was used on some marine triple-expansion engines. Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one {{at each end of the}} engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the four-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the Olympic class), but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually <b>vibration-free</b> turbine engine.|$|E
50|$|In {{the marine}} environment, the general {{requirement}} was for autonomy and increased operating range, as ships {{had to carry}} their coal supplies. The old salt-water boiler was thus no longer adequate {{and had to be}} replaced by a closed fresh-water circuit with condenser. The result from 1880 onwards was the multiple-expansion engine using three or four expansion stages (triple- and quadruple-expansion engines). These engines used a series of double-acting cylinders of progressively increasing diameter and/or stroke (and hence volume) designed to divide the work into three or four, as appropriate, equal portions for each expansion stage. Where space is at a premium, two smaller cylinders of a large sum volume might be used for the low-pressure stage. Multiple-expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged in-line, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing 'system' was used on some marine triple-expansion engines. Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the Olympic class), but was ultimately replaced by the virtually <b>vibration-free</b> steam turbine.|$|E
50|$|In a large displacement, {{high-power}} engine, a 60° V12 {{fits into}} a longer and narrower space than a V8 {{and most other}} V configurations, which {{is a problem in}} modern cars, but less so in heavy trucks, and seldom a problem in large stationary engines. The V12 is common in locomotive and battle tank engines, where high power is required, but the width of the engine is constrained by tight railway clearances or street widths, while the length of the vehicle is more flexible. It is often used in marine engines where great power is required, and the hull width is limited, but a longer vessel allows faster hull speed. In twin-propeller boats, two V12 engines can be narrow enough to sit side-by-side, while three V12 engines are sometimes used in high-speed three-propeller configurations. Large, fast cruise ships can have six or more V12 engines. In historic piston-engine fighter and bomber aircraft, the long, narrow V12 configuration used in high-performance aircraft made them more streamlined than other engines, particularly the short, wide radial engine. During World War II the power of fighter engines was stepped up to extreme levels using multi-speed superchargers and ultra-high octane gasoline, so the extreme smoothness of the V12 prevented the powerful engines from tearing apart the light airframes of fighters (often made out of wood and canvas rather than aluminum). After World War II, the compact, more powerful, and <b>vibration-free</b> turboprop and turbojet engines replaced the V12 in aircraft applications.|$|E
40|$|An output {{feedback}} sliding mode controller (SMC) {{is proposed}} {{to minimize the}} effects of vibrations of slewing flexible manipulators.

40|$|The {{application}} of input precompensators to flexible manipulators is considered. Frequency domain compensators color the input around the flexible mode locations, {{resulting in a}} bandstop or notch filter in cascade with the system. Time domain compensators apply a sequence of impulses at prespecified times related to the modal frequencies. The resulting control corresponds to a feedforward term that convolves in real-time the desired reference input with a sequence of impulses and produces a <b>vibration-free</b> output. An adaptive precompensator can be implemented by combining a frequency domain identification scheme {{which is used to}} estimate online the modal frequencies and subsequently update the bandstop interval or the spacing between the impulses. The combined adaptive input preshaping scheme provides the most rapid slew that results in a <b>vibration-free</b> output. Experimental results are presented to verify the results...|$|E
40|$|METIS, the Mid-infrared E-ELT Imager and Spectrograph, {{is one of}} {{instruments}} in the European Extremely Large Telescope. Its detectors require cryogenic cooling at three temperature levels below that of liquid nitrogen, 8 K, 25 K, and 40 K. <b>Vibration-free</b> cooling {{is one of the}} technologies that were identified as the most needed {{in the development of the}} METIS instruments. Therefore, a useful cooling technology based on sorption Joule-Thomson (JT) coolers was proposed for the METIS by University of Twente. The scope of this thesis is to provide <b>vibration-free</b> cooling at multiple cryogenic temperatures for the optics and infrared detectors in large ground telescopes. The thesis focuses on developing a <b>vibration-free</b> sorption-based JT cooler for the METIS instrument in the E-ELT. The research is characterized by challenges such as multiple cooling levels, large cooling capacity with considerable efficiency and size, manufacturability and costs, etc [...] The development initialized by gathering basic inputs, such as adsorption isotherms and optimization of the working fluids according to the cooling requirement. A conceptual baseline design of the METIS cooler chain was first defined to present a first impression, particularly in terms of the input power and size. Based on this baseline design, three demonstration setups were built and tested to validate the cooler design: 1. Full-scale 8 K helium JT cold stage; 2. Scaled helium sorption compressor; 3. Scaled 40 K neon sorption JT cooler...|$|E
