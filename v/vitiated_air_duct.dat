An analysis of heated air expended from a high temperature source to test section conditions also indicates that there is sufficient free radical content in the incoming flow to cause early ignition.

40|$|Planar Rayleigh {{scattering}} (PRS) and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) {{were used}} to investigate the <b>vitiated</b> <b>air</b> component of a coaxial hydrogen/vitiated air nonpremixed turbulent jet flame that is ejected at a Mach number of 2. All experiments were performed with a xenon chloride tunable excimer laser. Planar information for both techniques was obtained using laser sheets 6 cm high, 5 cm wide, and 300 micron thick. In this flow field, the effective Rayleigh {{cross section of the}} components in the <b>vitiated</b> <b>air</b> was assumed to be independent of composition. Therefore, the PRS technique produced signals which were proportional to total density. When the flow field was assumed to be at a known and uniform pressure, the PRS signal data for the <b>vitiated</b> <b>air</b> could be converted to temperature information. Also, PLIF images were generated by probing the OH molecule. These images contain striation patterns attributed to small localized instantaneous temperature nonuniformities.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the vitiation effects of test air on the {{scramjet}} performance in the ground combustion heated facilities. The primary goal is to evaluate the effects of H 2 O and CO 2, the two major vitiated species generated by combustion heater, on hydrogen-fueled supersonic combustor performance with experimental and numerical approaches. The comparative experiments in the clean <b>air</b> and <b>vitiated</b> <b>air</b> are conducted by using the resistance heated direct-connected facility, with the typical Mach 4 flight conditions simulated. The H 2 O and CO 2 species with accurately controlled contents {{are added to the}} high enthalpy clean air from resistance heater, to synthesize the <b>vitiated</b> <b>air</b> of a combustion-type heater. Typically, the contents of H 2 O species can be varied within the range of 3. 5 %– 30 % by mole, and 3. 0 %– 10 % for CO 2 species. The total temperature, total pressure, Mach number and O 2 mole fraction at the combustor entrance are well-matched between the clean <b>air</b> and <b>vitiated</b> <b>air.</b> The combustion experiments are completed at the fuel equivalence ratios of 0. 53 and 0. 42 respectively. Furthermore, three-dimensional (3 D) reacting flow simulations of combustor flowpath are performed to provide insight into flow field structures and combustion chemistry details that cannot resolved by experimental instruments available. Finally, the experimental data, combined with computational results, are employed to analyze the effects of H 2 O and CO 2 <b>vitiated</b> <b>air</b> on supersonic combustion characteristics and performance. It is concluded that H 2 O and CO 2 contaminants can significantly inhibit the combustion induced pressure rise measured from combustor wall, and the pressure profile decreases with the increasing H 2 O and CO 2 contents in nonlinear trend; simulation results agree well with experimental data and the overall vitiation effects are captured; direct extrapolation of the results from <b>vitiated</b> <b>air</b> to predict the performance of actual flight conditions could result in over-fueling the combustor, possible inlet un-start and inappropriate combustion mode transition. The detailed analysis and discussion are presented and the research conclusions are summarized...|$|R

40|$|Background: High-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> is the {{government}} program to supply electricity needs. However, in practice, obstacles {{have been identified in}} the form of rejection from the community due to the outstanding issues that high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> have an impact on health. Aim: This research aims to analysis the magnitude of electromagnetic wave radiation of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> construction on health. Methods: The study was conducted by measuring electromagnetic wave radiation prior to high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> (150 kV) construction and predicting the amount of radiation generated after this operation and its impact on health. Result: The field measurement result showed that the highest strength of magnetic field in the absence of construction and operation activity of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> 150 kV was 0. 00085 mT and the highest electric field was 0. 004241251 V/m. The results of the magnetic field strength analysis showed that the highest strength of magnetic field and electric field when the high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> is completed and operated was magnetic field of 0. 00415 mT and electric field of 38. 4 V/m. The value was far lower than the standard limits recommended by IRPA / INIRC, WHO 1990 and SNI 04 - 6950 - 2003. The allowed electric field strength is 5 kV / m and the allowed magnetic field strength is 0. 1 mT. Conclusion: Electromagnetic wave radiation of High-Voltage <b>Air</b> <b>Ducts</b> is not exceeded the allowed limit, so it will not cause a direct risk to health. ...|$|R

40|$|In ground tests, stored {{high-pressure}} air must be heated significantly, before expansion {{through a}} facility nozzle, to simulate hypersonic flight conditions. Resultants “vitiation effects ” (using the term broadly) thus refer to particular chemical kinetic and thermodynamic effects on Scramjet (SCRJ) combustion {{caused by the}} use of artificially-heated (<b>vitiated)</b> <b>air.</b> Such heating may be accomplished in various ways. Two electrical techniques are by arc or by inductive electric (e. g., Plasmatron technology) heating. Both techniques are relatively expensive in terms of initial investment. A less expensive, simpler technology involves combustion preheating of beds of bricks or ceramic pebbles, followed by the input/heating of dry compressed air (as in Japan’s NAL facility at Kakuda RC). Finally, an even lower cost air heating techniques is to burn fuel (e. g., H 2, CH 4, or C 3 H 8) with a predetermined equivalence ratio, and then expands the resultant <b>vitiated</b> <b>air,</b> with or without oxygen makeup, through a facility nozzle. The question faced here is how to characterize and control the resultant effects on SCRJ test performance, since the <b>vitiated</b> <b>air</b> will differ from inlet-processed ambient air fed to a combustor in actual flight. 4. 1. 1 PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL EFFECTS DUE TO VITIATION Several physical-chemical “facility processing effects ” are currently recognized, starting with knowledge that species introduced to a typical test airstreams differ from those emerging from inlet-processe...|$|R

40|$|The {{underground}} <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> along peripheral {{walls of}} a building are a remediation method, which principle is to enable an air flow along the moist building structure’s surface to allow a sufficient evaporation of moisture from the structure. This measure reduces the water transport (rising moisture) into the higher parts of the wall where the high water content in masonry is undesirable. Presently, underground <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> are designed as masonry structures, which durability in contact with ground moisture is limited.
