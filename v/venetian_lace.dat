60|$|Never mind, {{she would}} dye {{it when she}} grew up, or bleach it in the sun, till it was {{bleached}} fair. Meanwhile she wore a fair white coif of pure <b>Venetian</b> <b>lace.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{developed}} {{a streak of}} extravagance in Venice, and purchased <b>Venetian</b> <b>lace</b> and Venetian glassware {{to such an extent}} that the nieces had to assure him they were all supplied with enough to last them and their friends for all time to come. Major Doyle had asked for a meerschaum pipe and a Florentine leather pocket book; so Uncle John made a collection of thirty-seven pipes of all shapes and sizes, and bought so many pocketbooks that Patsy declared her father could use a different one every day in the month.|$|E
60|$|The {{scent of}} {{chocolate}} filled his nostrils, and he vaguely saw a good-looking young man reclining under a coverlet of magnificent <b>Venetian</b> <b>lace,</b> and listening placidly {{to what was}} obviously a very amusing tale related to him by well-rouged lips. From the billowy satins and laces of the couch a delicate hand was waved toward him as he attempted to pay his respects to {{the most powerful man}} in France; the next moment the same stony-faced gorgon clad in scarlet and gold beckoned to him to follow, and he found himself being led through the brilliantly dressed crowd toward a compact group of backs, which formed a sort of living wall, painted in delicate colours of green and mauve and gray, and duly filled up the approach to the main window embrasure.|$|E
50|$|Rosaline lace is a late 17th-century <b>Venetian</b> needle <b>lace,</b> and a late 19th-century bobbin part lace imitation. A Brussels variant with needle lace pearls {{is called}} Rosaline Perl√©e. The variant made in Bruges lacked the pearls.|$|R
50|$|Point de Venise (also Gros Point de Venise) is a <b>Venetian</b> needle <b>lace</b> {{from the}} 17th century {{characterized}} by scrolling floral patterns with additional floral motifs worked in relief (in {{contrast with the}} geometric designs of the earlier reticella).|$|R
5000|$|... "Irish crochet" [...] was {{originally}} developed in mid-nineteenth century Ireland {{as a method}} of imitating expensive <b>Venetian</b> point <b>laces.</b> Within a few years it was being taught in almost every convent in the country and used part of Famine Relief Schemes. Charity groups sought to revive the economy by teaching crochet lace technique at no charge to anyone willing to learn. This type of lace is characterized by separately crocheted motifs, which were later assembled into a mesh background. Other types of Irish crochet include Rosslea and Clones lace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{it makes}} no difference!" [...] {{retorted}} Lydia, wildly. [...] "I am going away. I am going home. I have money enough to get to Trieste, and the ship is there, and Captain Jenness will take me back with him. Oh!" [...] she moaned. [...] "He has been in Europe, too, and I suppose he's {{like the rest of}} you; and he thought because I was alone and helpless he had the right to--Oh, I see it, I see now that he never meant anything, and--Oh, oh, oh!" [...] She fell on her knees beside the bed, as if crushed to them by the cruel doubt that suddenly overwhelmed her, and flung out her arms on Mrs. Erwin's coverlet--it was of <b>Venetian</b> <b>lace</b> sewed upon silk, a choice bit from the palace of one of the ducal families--and buried her face in it.|$|E
60|$|She {{went to the}} old iron coffer, {{and taking}} a small key from her girdle she {{unlocked}} it. The rusty hinges, screaming shrilly as she threw back the lid, proclaimed how seldom {{it was that she}} had penetrated into the sacred recesses of her treasure-chest. At the top were some relics of old finery: a silken cloak spangled with golden stars, a coif of silver filigree, a roll of <b>Venetian</b> <b>lace.</b> Beneath were little packets tied in silk which the old lady handled with tender care: a man's hunting-glove, a child's shoe, a love-knot done in faded green ribbon, some letters in rude rough script, and a vernicle of Saint Thomas. Then from the very bottom of the box she drew three objects, swathed in silken cloth, which she uncovered and laid upon the table. The one was a bracelet of rough gold studded with uncut rubies, the second was a gold salver, and the third was a high goblet of the same metal.|$|E
60|$|Shelton {{made his}} way up to his cousin--a fragile, grey-haired woman in black velvet and <b>Venetian</b> <b>lace,</b> whose starry eyes beamed at him, until her duties, after the custom of these social gatherings, obliged her to break off {{conversation}} just as it began to interest him. He was passed on to another lady who was already talking to two gentlemen, and, their volubility being greater than his own, he fell into the position of observer. Instead of the profound questions he had somehow expected to hear raised, everybody seemed gossiping, or searching the heart of such topics as where to go this summer, or how to get new servants. Trifling with coffee-cups, they dissected their fellow artists {{in the same way as}} his society friends of the other night had dissected the fellow--"smart"; and the varnish on the floor, the pictures, and the piano were reflected on all the faces around. Shelton moved from group to group disconsolate.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1870s {{the second}} French empire collapsed, {{concurrently}} fashion changed. The cheaper guipures were affected but the better Brussels laces stayed {{in demand for}} wedding trousseaux. Designs and technique however remained much the same. [...] Individuality of lace types decreased and interest for making lace as a hobby increased. In the 1880s the lace industry revived with imitations of old laces. Aalst developed a lace with a technique based on Duchesse lace. The frequent little roses gave the lace its name: Rosaline. The same name {{has been used for}} a seventeenth century <b>Venetian</b> needle <b>lace</b> with similar design. The Belgian Rosaline was produced until the 1950s and rediscovered in 1980s. The lace is flexible to changing fashion. Worn and unsold pieces could be reassembled.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{uncle was}} more prosperous than his brothers; {{he lived in}} a much better house than ours, and I used to be quite awe-struck by its magnificence. He went East, as we said, twice a year to buy goods, and he had things sent back for his house such as we never saw elsewhere; those cask-shaped seats of blue china for the verandas, and bamboo chairs. There were cane-bottom chairs in the sitting-room, such as we had in our best room; in the parlor the large pieces were of {{mahogany}} veneer, upholstered in black hair-cloth; they held me in awe. The piano filled half the place; the windows came down to the ground, and had <b>Venetian</b> blinds and <b>lace</b> curtains.|$|R
60|$|But she, {{when she}} appeared, {{was not in}} mourning. He fancied that she wore the lustrous black silk, with the breadths of white <b>Venetian</b> <b>lace</b> about the neck which he had praised, because he praised it. Her cheeks burned with a Jacqueminot crimson; what should be white in her face was chalky white. She carried a plumed ostrich fan, black and soft, and after giving him her hand, sat down and waved it to and fro slowly, as he remembered her doing the night they first met. She had no ideas, except such as related intimately to herself, {{and she had no}} gabble, like Mela; and she let him talk. It was past the day when she promised herself she would forgive him; but as he talked on she felt all her passion for him revive, and the {{conflict}} of desires, the desire to hate, the desire to love, made a dizzying whirl in her brain. She looked at him, half doubting whether he was really there or not. He had never looked so handsome, with his dreamy eyes floating under his heavy overhanging hair, and his pointed brown beard defined against his lustrous shirtfront. His mellowly modulated, mysterious voice lulled her; when Mela made an errand out of the room, and Beaton crossed to her and sat down by her, she shivered.|$|E
