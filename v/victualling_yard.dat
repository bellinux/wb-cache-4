5|$|Diarist John Evelyn {{lived in}} Deptford at Sayes Court from 1652. Evelyn {{inherited}} {{the house when}} he married the daughter of Sir Richard Browne in 1652. On his return to England at the Restoration, Evelyn laid out meticulously planned gardens in the French style, of hedges and parterres. In its grounds was a cottage at one time rented by master woodcarver Grinling Gibbons. After Evelyn had moved to Surrey in 1694, Russian Tsar Peter the Great studied shipbuilding for three months in 1698. He {{and some of his}} fellow Russians stayed at Sayes Court, the manor house of Deptford. Evelyn was angered at the antics of the Tsar, who got drunk with his friends and, using a wheelbarrow with Peter in it, rammed their way through a fine holly hedge. Sayes Court was demolished in 1728-9 and a workhouse built on its site. Part of the estates around Sayes Court were purchased in 1742 for the building of the Navy <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard,</b> which was renamed the Royal Victoria Victualing Yard in 1858 after a visit by Queen Victoria. This massive facility included warehouses, a bakery, a cattleyard/abattoir and sugar stores, and closed in 1961. All that remains is the name of Sayes Court Park, accessed from Sayes Court Street off Evelyn Street, not far from Deptford High Street. The Pepys Estate, opened on 13 July 1966, is on the former grounds of the Victualing Yard.|$|E
5|$|The Docks {{had been}} {{gradually}} declining from the 18th century; the larger ships being built found The Thames difficult to navigate, and Deptford was under {{competition from the}} new docks at Plymouth, Portsmouth and Chatham. When the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815 {{the need for a}} Docks to build and repair warships declined; the Docks shifted from shipbuilding to concentrate on victualling at the Royal Victoria <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard,</b> and the Royal Dock closed in 1869. From 1871 until the First World War the shipyard site was the City of London Corporation's Foreign Cattle Market, in which girls and women butchered sheep and cattle until {{the early part of the}} 20th century. At its peak, around 1907, over 234,000 animals were imported annually through the market, but by 1912 these figures had declined to less than 40,000 a year. The yard was taken over by the War Office in 1914, and was an Army Supply Reserve Depot in the First and Second World Wars. The site lay unused until being purchased by Convoys (newsprint importers) in 1984, and eventually came into the ownership of News International. In the mid-1990s, although significant investment was made on the site, it became uneconomic to continue using it as a freight wharf. In 2008 Hutchison Whampoa bought the 16ha site from News International with plans for a £700m 3,500-home development scheme. The Grade II listed Olympia Warehouse will be refurbished as part of the redevelopment of the site.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only did}} the site allow access to the bay, the {{presence}} of Parson's Lodge Battery afforded protection from gunfire. The <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard</b> complex, including the <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard,</b> Rosia Water Tanks, and Rosia Mole, was constructed {{at the turn of}} the nineteenth century, the tanks begun in 1799 and finished in 1804.|$|E

50|$|Surveyor of Marine Victuals, was {{responsible}} for the administration of <b>victualling</b> <b>yards</b> and supply of food and beverages for the Royal Navy from 1550-1679, his office was abolished and replaced by the Victualling Board in 1683.|$|R
50|$|By 1739 {{the various}} Victualling Office {{facilities}} {{cost the state}} £16,241 to maintain, in addition to expenses {{for the purchase of}} victuals. In 1747, during the War of the Austrian Succession, this had risen to £30,393. In due course facilities were consolidated into <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yards</b> each with several processes and related storehouses accommodated on a single site. The Yards had deep-water wharves and were accessible (wind and weather permitting) from the major anchorages used by the Fleet. Under normal circumstances, ships due to set sail were expected to come to the nearest Yard to be loaded up with provisions. These would include preserved foodstuffs designed to last weeks or even months: ship's biscuit, salted beef, salted pork, pease, oatmeal, butter, cheese and beer. Most of these items were transported and stored in casks, which were themselves manufactured by the Board in large numbers at its on-site cooperages. In addition, the <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yards</b> provided fresh meat, bread and other items to ships stationed in port.|$|R
25|$|Dockyard {{facilities}} {{were also used}} to resupply and victual the navy's warships; Deptford's <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard</b> was founded upstream of the main dockyard: the Victualling Board leased the Red House estate in 1743 and established its main depot at Deptford, embarking {{on the construction of}} stores and mills. In time, the two yards became physically merged as the dockyard expanded in the <b>victualling</b> <b>yard,</b> both being enclosed by a wall. Deptford's proximity to the food markets of London made it especially convenient for victualling, and it served the requirements not only of its own neighbouring Dockyard, but those of Woolwich, Sheerness and Chatham as well. In 1858 it was renamed the Royal Victoria <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard,</b> following similar re-brandings in Plymouth, Portsmouth and Ireland.|$|E
25|$|The Rosia Water Tanks {{consisted}} of six parallel underground chambers built by contractor Giovanni Maria Boschetti {{adjacent to the}} <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard</b> of bricks brought from Britain and sand-lime mortar, then waterproofed. The roofs of the <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard</b> served as a catchment directing rain to a settlement tank, which was then purified by flowing it successively from one tank to the next. The lowest tank was sufficiently high to gravity feed vessels berthed at Rosia Mole. Hoses were used to supply vessels within Rosia Bay, a lighter barge those anchored off it in Gibraltar Harbour.|$|E
25|$|John Jervis, 1st Earl St Vincent (1735-1823), Admiral in Charge of the Mediterranean Fleet, made {{recommendations}} in 1799 concerning {{the location of}} the <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard</b> in Gibraltar. St Vincent advised the <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard</b> be relocated from the Old Mole area to Rosia Bay so that both water and food could be provided to Royal Navy vessels from one site. Governor O'Hara did not approve of St Vincent's plan because he proposed to finance it by selling the naval stores at Waterport and Irish Town. However St Vincent won.|$|E
50|$|Deptford was {{the largest}} and busiest of the <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yards</b> (being {{advantageously}} close to the food wharves and markets of London). The other Naval Dockyards in the Thames area (Chatham, Sheerness and Woolwich) were all dependent on Deptford for victualling. (The Commissioners did maintain a small Yard at Chatham but little or no manufacturing took place here, {{it was more a}} storage depot). Deptford also directly supplied aYard at Gibraltar (established in the eighteenth century).|$|R
50|$|New <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yards</b> {{were still}} being {{established}} in the early 20th century, both at home (e.g. the Royal Elizabeth Yard, Dalmeny: a minor yard built to serve the new Dockyard at Rosyth) and abroad (e.g. the Royal Edward Yard, Darling Island, Sydney Harbour, Australia: built by the Government of New South Wales). Indeed, provisioning methods remained substantially unchanged until more widespread use of tinned foods, and then refrigeration, were adopted later in the century. At Gosport, the cooperage remained operational until 1970, when its work ceased along with the rum ration.|$|R
25|$|The fort was {{constructed}} {{in response to a}} naval arms race between Britain and France. Britain's coastal defences had not been substantially upgraded since the Napoleonic Wars, but a new generation of accurate and powerful guns, mounted on fast-moving, manoueuvrable iron-clad warships, had obsoleted the existing 18th and early 19th century forts along the British coastline. The Thames was seen as particularly vulnerable; as well as being one of the country's most important trade routes, it possessed several naval installations of great importance, including the <b>victualling</b> <b>yards</b> at Deptford, the armaments works of Woolwich Arsenal, the shipbuilding yards at North Woolwich, and the magazines at Purfleet.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard</b> {{continued}} in operation {{for almost a}} century after {{the closure of the}} dockyard, dedicated to the manufacture and storage of food, drink, clothing and furniture for the navy, until its closure in 1961.|$|E
25|$|Appeals {{were made}} to the Governor of Gibraltar, Sir Francis Richards, to list the tanks with the Gibraltar Heritage Trust. Despite the pleas, neither the tanks nor the <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard</b> were listed in 2006. Listing was limited to the {{entrance}} to the yard. The Rosia Water Tanks were demolished in August 2006 despite strong opposition. The government's actions were the subject of local and international criticism.|$|E
25|$|Plymouth grew {{up around}} a natural harbour {{on the eastern side}} of the {{promontory}} now known as Plymouth Hoe, on the south Devon coast. Naval dockyards were established at Plymouth Dock (later known as Devonport), facing across the River Tamar to the north west of Plymouth; Stonehouse was sandwiched between the two and became the home for military barracks, hospitals and a <b>victualling</b> <b>yard.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1588, {{the daily}} {{allowance}} {{on board a}} Royal Navy ship was one pound of biscuits plus one gallon of beer. Later, Samuel Pepys in 1667 first regularized naval victualing with varied and nutritious rations. Royal Navy hardtack during Queen Victoria's reign was made by machine at the Royal Clarence <b>Victualing</b> <b>Yard</b> at Gosport, Hampshire, stamped with the Queen's mark {{and the number of}} the oven in which it was baked. Biscuits remained {{an important part of the}} Royal Navy sailor’s diet until the introduction of canned foods; canned meat was first marketed in 1814, and preserved beef in tins was officially introduced to the Royal Navy rations in 1847.|$|R

5000|$|In 1895, W.W. Greener {{invented the}} world's first Humane Killer, a gun {{designed}} to kill cattle, sheep, pigs and horses, quickly and easily. This instrument {{was adopted by}} the War Office, for use in the Veterinary, Remount and Butchering Departments, and by the Admiralty for its <b>Victualling</b> <b>yards.</b> The instrument was also modified to use [...]310 caliber cartridges. After several years, the models became obsolete in the 1960s and ammunition for the older models was impossible to obtain. Recently though, the company was asked to manufacture another model and hence, the Humane Killer Mk II was introduced. This new gun fires a [...]32 ACP round.|$|R
25|$|The {{dockyard}} {{declined in}} importance after the Napoleonic Wars. Its location upriver on the Thames made access difficult, and the shallow narrow river hampered navigation {{of the large}} new warships. The dockyard was largely inactive after 1830, and though shipbuilding briefly returned in the 1840s the navy closed the yard in 1869. The <b>victualling</b> <b>yard</b> that had been established in the 1740s continued in use until the 1960s, while the land used by the dockyard was sold, the area now being known as Convoys Wharf.|$|E
25|$|Under British {{rule the}} Royal Navy {{made use of}} a {{careening}} wharf at Port Royal and rented a building on the foreshore {{to serve as a}} storehouse. From 1675 a resident Naval Officer was appointed to oversee these facilities; however, development was cut short by the 1692 earthquake. After the earthquake, an attempt was made to establish a naval base at Port Antonio instead, but the climate there proved disagreeable. From 1735, Port Royal once more became the focus of the Admiralty's attention. New wharves and storehouses were built at this time, as well as housing for the officers of the Yard. Over the next thirty years, more facilities were added: cooperages, workshops, sawpits, and accommodation (including a canteen) for the crews of ships being careened there. A Royal Naval Hospital was also established on land a little {{to the west of the}} Naval Yard; and by the end of the 18th century a small <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard</b> had been added to the east (prior to this ships had had to go to Kingston and other settlements to take on supplies).|$|E
500|$|Between 1797 and 1799 {{alongside}} {{the suppression of}} mutiny Jervis set himself the task of improving the dockyards and defences of Gibraltar including building a new <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard</b> and Water Tanks to replenish his ships. After the Battle of the Nile the dockyards, under Jervis' watchful eye, managed to successfully repair most of the fleet. Lady Lavinia Bingham, wife of Earl Spencer wrote to St Vincent to congratulate him for having provided the necessary tools for Nelson to have achieved the victory he did at the Nile. [...] "Never did disinterested zeal and friendship meet with a brighter reward than yours has reaped in this victory of your gallant friend." [...] Nelson commented that he had [...] "never beheld a fleet equal to Sir John Jervis'" [...] Having had great difficulty supplying the fleet with fresh water the Admiral arranged for large tanks {{to be built in}} Gibraltar. On 14 February 1799 St Vincent was created admiral of the white. Constant service and approaching old age meant that the admiral became increasingly unwell. Despite his failing health, St Vincent was reluctant to relinquish command and the Board reluctant to supersede him. By 17 June 1799 {{he had no choice but}} to resign his command and return to England. During his time ashore the Earl lived in Rochetts, Essex with his wife.|$|E
50|$|Gosport {{is a town}} {{situated}} {{on the west side}} of Portsmouth Harbour on England’s south coast. It has, since the 18th century, been the repository of large establishments connected to Portsmouth’s Royal Naval Dockyard, which were not able to be accommodated within the Dockyard or within the crowded City of Portsmouth which surrounds it. These establishments included the R.N. Armaments Depot of Priddy’s Hard, the Clarence <b>victualing</b> <b>yard,</b> Haslar Royal Naval hospital, HMS Dolphin submarine base and the Lee-on-Solent Fleet Air-Arm base. Gosport had almost all its workforce working either in Portsmouth’s Naval establishments or in the Dockyard itself. In the 18th and 19th centuries the town was crowded with public houses and was set in elaborate fortifications protecting it from a landward attack.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the tower's construction, there were {{widespread}} fears that the imperial rivalry between Britain and France could result in a French invasion or naval incursion along the River Thames. The Thames was seen as particularly vulnerable; as well as being one of the UK's most important trade routes, it possessed several naval installations of great importance, including the <b>victualling</b> <b>yards</b> at Deptford, the armaments works of Woolwich Arsenal, the shipbuilding yards at North Woolwich, and the magazines at Purfleet. The Medway also had major installations, notably the Chatham Dockyard, which had been targeted to devastating effect by the Dutch during the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1667. It was thus deemed essential to prevent an enemy entering the Medway and reaching the dockyard.|$|R
50|$|The Yard was {{released}} from the MOD in 1992 and subsequently passed to the Plymouth Development Corporation, upon their demise in 1999 it then passed to The South West Regional Development Agency (SWRDA) who funded and carried out the extensive c£60m restoration of the structural fabric of the majority of principal buildings and infrastructure within the yard between 1999 and 2008. During this period the buildings were re categorised from Scheduled Ancient Monuments to Grade I / 11 listed structures. Private sector development partners Urban Splash were then engaged to carry out the specialist conversion of the site into to an up-market mixed-use development. Described as the grandest of the royal <b>victualling</b> <b>yards,</b> 'in its externally largely unaltered state it remains today one of the most magnificent industrial monuments in the country'.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard</b> complex, {{including}} the tanks, enabled Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson (1758 [...] 1805) {{to maintain his}} fleet in the Mediterranean. Four days before the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar Lord Nelson notified Rear Admiral John Knight of a water shortage aboard his flagship, HMS Victory, requesting he keep the matter to himself. That letter to Knight, written with Nelson's left hand, as {{he had lost his}} right hand, went up for auction at Sotheby's in July 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Coad, also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, is with English Heritage. The {{author of}} The Royal Dockyards 1690-1850, he is {{considered}} to be a preeminent authority on Royal Naval Dockyard architecture. He contacted the Naval Dockyards Society, expressing his dismay over [...] "the destruction of the vaulted underground storage tanks, which were a remarkable construction feat", and continued that [...] "equally serious will be the impact of the multi-storey building upon the enclosure of the <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard</b> which will seriously affect the whole setting of this remarkable enclave and destroy the intimate scale of this area." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{distinguished}} {{himself in}} the service of the Transport Board during the Napoleonic Wars, overseeing the movement of troops to and from continental Europe and earning the thanks of Swedish royalty and the Duke of Wellington. Advanced to post-captain, he continued in this role for some years after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, until being appointed Captain-Superintendent of Deptford <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard.</b> The remainder of his career was spent ashore at the navy's dockyards, moving to Sheerness Dockyard and then back to Deptford. He was knighted for his services in 1831, and while at Sheerness in 1838, oversaw preparations for selling [...] He retired in 1851 with the rank of rear-admiral and died in 1855.|$|E
50|$|Ships' {{ordnance}} (guns, {{weapons and}} ammunition) was provided independently by the Board of Ordnance, which set {{up its own}} Ordnance Yards alongside several of the Royal Dockyards {{both at home and}} abroad. Similarly, the Victualling Board established <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yards</b> in several Dockyard locations, which furnished warships with their provisions of food, beer and rum. In the mid-eighteenth century the Sick and Hurt Board established Naval Hospitals in the vicinity of Plymouth Dock and Portsmouth; by the mid-nineteenth century there were Royal Naval Hospitals close to most of the major and minor Naval Dockyards in Britain, in addition to several of them overseas (the oldest dating from the early 1700s). As the age of steam eclipsed the age of sail, Coaling Yards were established alongside several yards, and at strategic points around the globe.|$|R

Such vessels posed {{a serious threat to}} the important naval installations on the Thames, including the <b>victualling</b> <b>yards</b> at Deptford, the armaments works of Woolwich Arsenal, the shipbuilding yards at North Woolwich, and the magazines at Purfleet. It was not possible for large warships to reach central London, as the river was not yet deep enough to take ships of more than 400 tons above Deptford. However, as the American Civil War was soon to show, it was quite possible for the warships of the day to run past forts and attack up coastal rivers.|$|R

His next assignment was in November 1866, {{when he became}} commander-in-chief in the Pacific, with the broadside ironclad [...] as his flagship. He received another promotion on 10 September 1869 when he was raised to vice-admiral, and returned to Britain in November that year.

They were {{constructed}} based on the recommendation by Admiral John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent that the <b>Victualling</b> <b>Yard</b> complex be relocated to Rosia Bay. The complex allowed Royal Navy vessels to obtain both food and water at one site. The Rosia Water Tanks remained in the possession of the Ministry of Defence until 2004, at which time they were transferred to the Government of Gibraltar. Despite local and international criticism, and a court case brought by the Gibraltar Heritage Trust, the tanks were demolished in 2006 to make way for affordable housing. When developer OEM International's funding proved insufficient to complete the project the government repossessed the site.|$|E
