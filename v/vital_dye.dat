5000|$|Neural crest {{was first}} {{described}} in the chick embryo by Wilhelm His in 1868 as [...] "the cord in between" [...] (Zwischenstrang) because of its origin between the neural plate and non-neural ectoderm.

During {{the first half of}} the 20th century the majority of research on neural crest was done using amphibian embryos which was reviewed by Hörstadius (1950) in a well known monograph.

5000|$|Early embryologists used [...] "vital dyes" [...] (which would stain but {{not harm}} the cells) to follow {{movements}} of individual cells {{or groups of}} cells over time in Xenopus frog embryos. The tissue(s) to which the cells contribute would thus be labeled and visible in the adult organism. The first person to develop and use this technique to study cell fate was embryologist Walter Vogt in 1929. Vogt used small chips of agar impregnated with a <b>vital</b> <b>dye,</b> (such as Nile Blue or Nile Red) which he placed on a particular cell or population of cells in Xenopus embryos until the dye absorbed into the yolk platelets within the desired cell(s). Once the cells were effectively labeled, the agar chip could be removed and the embryo was allowed to develop normally. With this method, Vogt was able to discern movements of particular cell populations and the ultimate organ or tissue into which they integrated. Although innovative for the time, this technique is limiting in {{that the size of}} a chip of agar may not accommodate single-cell resolution studies at later stages of development, since successive cell divisions will yield smaller cells (until the embryo develops into a larval form that can eat, and thereby grow larger). Additionally, the cell or cell population of interest must be superficial, since the agar chip with the dye must be placed {{on the surface of the}} embryo.|$|E

50|$|In 1978, David Weisblat {{and colleagues}} in Gunther Stent's lab at Berkeley {{improved}} {{the technique of}} single-cell resolution fate mapping by injection of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme, and later fluorescent peptides (1980), into individual cells in Helobdella triserialis (leech) embryos during early development. All progeny of the injected cells could later be discerned by staining for HRP using benzidine substrate or visualized by fluorescence microscopy. This technique allowed the experimenter greater control and selectivity over what cell was labeled and traced. However, the opaque character of the HRP stain prevented use of <b>vital</b> <b>dye</b> nuclear counter-stains such as Hoechst 33258 (blue) to observe the mitotic state of the injected cell's progeny. Also, embryos had to be fixed in order to stain for the HRP, thus allowing only a single timepoint view of each individual leech embryo injected. The use of fluorescent peptides such as Rhodamine-D-protein (red, RDP) and Fluorescein-D-protein (yellow/green, FDP) conjugated to large carrier molecules to prevent diffusion through cell gap junctions, alleviated several of the shortcomings of HRP injection. Leech embryos injected with the fluorescent tracers could be visualized, and images collected of the same specimen at multiple timepoints, without fixation. The fluorescent tracers could also be combined with nuclear Hoechst staining to visualize the mitotic status of the progeny of injected cells. Seth Blair, also in Stent's lab, introduced a novel ablation technique {{that could be used}} in tandem with lineage tracing to pursue the questions relating to developmental potential changes in cell fate in experimentally perturbed embryos that were first raised by Roux and Driesch (1980). For this purpose, specific cells were ablated by microinjection with Pronase (an enzyme that digests proteins) to ablate the cell; later modifications of this technique employed DNase or the ricin A chain. The single-cell injection technique is now also in use by researchers studying other model organisms such as Xenopus (frogs), Danio rerio (zebrafish), and Caenorhabditis elegans (worms).|$|E

METHODS: Review, interpretation, and commentary regarding the most relevant experimental as well as clinical studies including the authors' clinical and laboratory research. RESULTS: There is a consensus that the application of <b>vital</b> <b>dyes</b> facilitates the delicate removal of intraocular membranes during vitreoretinal surgery. Controversy still remains around various issues, mainly potential toxicity and safety. There is room for further investigation of novel and specific <b>vital</b> <b>dyes.</b> Dyes such as Evans blue and light green may stain the internal limiting membrane very well, whereas fast green and indigo carmine may be very safe to the retina. However, comparing the staining and toxicity data has revealed that Bromophenol blue and Brilliant blue may be even better novel agents. the dyes currently used for different steps in chromovitrectomy are: triamcinolone acetonide for vitreous identification; indocyanine green, infracyanine green, and Brilliant blue for internal limiting membrane identification; and Trypan blue for epiretinal membrane identification.

Moreover, under conditions of controlled pH and concentration, acridine orange can differentiate, at the microscopic level, between RNA, doublestranded DNA, and single-stranded DNA. In this paper, we have brought together several aspects of our recent work related to the use of <b>vital</b> <b>dyes</b> in virus research. " 2 Included are studies on: the photo-inactivation enhancing effect of dyes incorporated into developing poliovirus; the multiplication of poliovirus using correlated cytochemical and fluorescent antibody techniques; and the use of acridine orange as a differential reagent for nucleic acids in purified viruses...|$|R
40|$|Mitochondrial {{movements}} were first observed over 80 years ago, although {{at the time}} mitochondria were merely curiosities with no known functions (6). The advent of <b>vital</b> <b>dyes</b> in the early 1980 s and green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in the mid 1990 s have made {{it much easier to}} follow The roles of mitochondria in cell death and in aging have generated much excitement in recent years. At the same time, however, a quiet revolution in our thinking about mitochondrial ultrastructure has begun. This revolution started with the use of <b>vital</b> <b>dyes</b> and of green fluorescent protein fusion proteins, showing that mitochondria are very dynamic structures that constantly move, divide and fuse throughout the life of a cell. More recently, some of the first proteins contributing to these various processes have been discovered. Our view of the internal structures of mitochondria has also changed. Three-dimensional reconstructions obtained with high voltage electron microscopy show that cristae are often connected to the mitochondrial inner membrane by thin tubules. These new insights are brought to bear on the wealth of data collected by conventional electron microscopic analysis...|$|R
