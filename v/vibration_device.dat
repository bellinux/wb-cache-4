50|$|Windows {{generally}} face uncontrolled areas (areas {{not under}} the control of the secure facility). They require protection. Most persons are not aware that windows respond well in the speech range of frequencies. The vibration caused by room speech is minute but can be detected remotely by laser microphones or directional microphones. The laser microphone system transmitter sends an infrared signal to the window and a special detector picks up the reflection. The reflection has been modified by the window vibration, so when the base frequency is removed (much the same as in radios) the detected vibration is that of a conversation or other internal sound. The location of the detector must be carefully chosen but the distance can be quite far. The directional microphone detects the very low level sound emitted by the window. The emitted sound spreads out, so the microphone angular position is not critical, but the distance to the window must be reasonably close. For protection, a <b>vibration</b> <b>device</b> is attached to the window that causes the window to vibrate with an appropriate masking signal. It is used to protect against vibration detection and radiated sound detection. The figure on the right shows the relative sound levels. The sound emitted within the secure room is insufficient to cause any interference with normal level conversation.|$|E

50|$|It {{is likely}} that {{primitive}} people did not want acoustical privacy, so they never camped near a rushing stream. They understood that stream noise would mask the approach of enemies or predators. The sound of fountains in Roman villas certainly served to mask the sounds of iron-rimmed chariot wheels on the cobble-stoned streets. Fountain masking has carried over to shopping malls or buildings with large atria. There are stories of a dentist, in the 1940s, applying random sound to patient’s ears through earphones to mask the terrible noise of slow speed drills. An example of a self-contained masker, made in the 1960s, {{is shown in the}} figure on the right.The application of electronics and the advent of the open office resulted in the rapid evolution of sound masking. The Quickborner Team of Germany introduced the concept of the open office to the United States in the late 1960s. Geiger-Hamme Laboratories developed a standard for open office acoustics in the 1970s. It was sponsored by the Public Building Service of the General Services Administration for use in open government offices. It included a requirement for sound masking. Many of the major furniture manufacturers, such as Herman Miller, Steelcase, and Haworth, converted much of their production to products for the open office. Herman Miller was the first to have self-contained maskers mounted pointing up on top of open office furniture panels. It did not survive primarily due to the presence of controls available to employees. Owens Corning, a manufacturer of fiberglass products, entered the open office market and introduced a centralized masking system using a speaker called the Sweeny baffle. This speaker was unusual in that the sound spectrum on axis was the same as the electrical spectrum. Unfortunately, off axis the spectrum was different; it no longer exists.Manufacturers of commercial sound systems entered the market in the 1970s; masking was an add-on to their other audio products. Soundolier (now part of Atlas Sound) sold a self contained masker that has survived until recently. The Dukane Corporation sold a masker that had two speakers contained in a heavy triangular enclosure. Companies that considered sound masking as their primary business came into existence about that time. One product, the Lahti masker, was a speaker mounted on the surface of a plastic sphere. Dynasound, Inc. introduced a masker that had a speaker mounted on the lid of two gallon paint can; the handle was used for plenum mounting. K.R. Moeller Associates sold a self-contained masker called Scamp, while the Lencore Corporation sold an equivalent unit, now called Spectra. A document was published in 1980 by the Defense Intelligence Agency. It concerned protection of secure facilities from deliberate audio surveillance; sound masking was one means of protection. Dynasound, Inc. developed a <b>vibration</b> <b>device</b> that could be attached to various surfaces such as doors, walls, and windows, to provide sound masking.In the 1980s, the Bertagni family developed a speaker that could not be distinguished from a fiberglass ceiling tile. The invisibility aspect was favorable to architects. The attempt was made to use this speaker for sound masking, but the cost and the sound radiating characteristics limited its use for that purpose. Armstrong World Industries, a manufacturer of ceiling materials, developed a similar speaker. This speaker has survived as a product of Sound Advance and is now used for applications other than sound masking. An early attitude among owners, designers, and architects was that masking was an excuse for a bad open office design. In early systems, the installers were not knowledgeable about how to provide privacy. As a result, many systems merely provided more noise and were shut off. This was countered by the rise of firms who specialized in the design, installation, and equalization, of masking systems. The evolution of sound masking since the 1980s is described in other sections.|$|E

40|$|Sensory {{augmentation}} using vibrotactile stimulation {{has been}} shown to compensate for distorted haptic feedback in tissue compliance differentiation tasks in laparoscopic surgery. This study investigated its usefulness for tumor palpation. A controlled experiment was conducted using a wearable vibrotactile device that responded with various levels of vibration signal parameters (i. e., amplitude, frequency and duty-cycle) as a function of applied force during a palpation task. Results showed that subjects were able to perform more accurately and more confidently, applying lower peak forces and smaller force ranges to make a judgment regarding the presence of an embedded structure, with vibrotactile augmentation than without. In addition, as more parameters of the vibration signal were modulated (up to three), the vibrotactile augmentation tended to be more effective, possibly due to the greater information content in the multi-parameter signal. This suggests that palpation can be improved by implementing a <b>vibration</b> <b>device</b> that is capable of multi-dimensional modulation. However, the design of the <b>vibration</b> <b>device</b> should balance the advantage of providing additional information for effective information transmission with that of signal redundancy and complexity...|$|E

Vibrotactile stimulation of the sole of the foot with a frequency of 50 Hz and a displacement of 1 mm was performed during fMRI (echo-planar imaging sequence at 1. 5 T) using an MRI compatible moving magnet actuator that is able to produce vibration frequencies between 0 and 100 Hz and displacement amplitudes between 0 and 4 mm. The fMRI measurement during vibrotactile stimulation of the right foot revealed brain activation contralaterally within the primary sensorimotor cortex, bilaterally within the secondary somatosensory cortex, bilaterally within the superior temporal, inferior parietal, and posterior insular region, bilaterally within the anterior and posterior cingular gyrus, bilaterally within the thalamus and caudate nucleus, contralaterally within the lentiform nucleus, and bilaterally within the anterior and posterior cerebellar lobe.
