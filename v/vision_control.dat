Neuro-ophthalmologists are often active teachers in their academic institution, and the first four winners of the prestigious Straatsma American Academy of Ophthalmology teaching awards were neuro-ophthalmologists. Most neuro-ophthalmologists are passionate about their discipline and report high job satisfaction, stating that they think the field continues to be both fascinating and challenging. Neuro-ophthalmology is mostly non-procedural, however, neuro-ophthalmologists may be trained to perform eye muscle surgery to treat adult strabismus, optic nerve fenestration for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and botulinum injections for blepharospasm or hemifacial spasm.|$|E

Their main role is to create goal-scoring opportunities using superior <b>vision,</b> <b>control,</b> and technical skill.The attacking midfielder is an important position that requires the player to possess superior technical abilities in terms of passing and, perhaps more importantly, the ability to read the opposing defence in order to deliver defence-splitting passes to the strikers; in addition to their technical and creative ability, they are also usually quick, agile, and mobile players, which aids them in beating opponents during dribbling runs.|$|E

Patients with HH often misperceive visual space. Here we investigated how HH affects visual motor control. Methods and Findings: Seven patients with complete HH and no neglect or cognitive decline and seven gender- and age-matched controls viewed displays in which a target moved randomly along the horizontal or the vertical axis. They used a joystick to control the target movement to keep it {{at the center of the}} screen. We found that the mean deviation of the target position from the center of the screen along the horizontal axis was biased toward the blind side for five out of seven HH patients.

5000|$|The {{consensus}} among Ophthalmologists, Orthoptists and Pediatricians is that [...] "visual training" [...] in non-strabismic Behavioural Vision therapy lacks documented scientific evidence of effectiveness.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} <b>vision</b> based <b>control</b> applied to {{autonomous}} mobile robots. The general approach in robot vision separates <b>vision</b> from <b>control</b> (static look and move). An alternative way consists {{to specify the}} problem in terms of control directly into the sensor frame. This approach {{seems to be a}} fruitful way for implementing robotics tasks based on reactivity concept. We introduce a low level task specification by the notion of virtual linkage. This virtual linkage can be expressed by a set of constraints on the motion of a frame linked to the robot with respect to a certain frame associated to the environnment. It seems interesting to apply such a <b>vision</b> based <b>control</b> to a mobile robot. The robot considered here is a two wheels driven nonholonomic cart with a camera mounted on 3 d. o. f manipulator.

50|$|A skilful, quick, and {{creative}} offensive playmaker, Antognoni {{is considered to}} be one of Italy's greatest players ever, one of the most talented players of his generation, {{and one of the best}} attacking midfielders of all time, due to his <b>vision,</b> <b>control,</b> technical ability, accurate distribution, passing range, and eye for goal from midfield. He was also an excellent dribbler, who was known for his pace and elegance on the ball, as well as quick feet, and his ability to keep his head up when advancing in possession. Although he was usually deployed as a traditional number 10 behind the forwards, he was also capable of playing as a central midfielder, where he functioned as a deep-lying playmaker. Antognoni was also highly regarded throughout his career for his accuracy from bending set pieces, and for his powerful shots from outside the area; although naturally right footed, he was capable of passing or striking the ball accurately with both feet. In addition to his footballing skills, he also stood out for his leadership throughout his career. Despite his talent, his career was largely marked by injuries.|$|E
