[...] Compression is also used [...] to decrease release of inflammatory cytokines, lower the amount of fluid leaking from capillaries and therefore prevent swelling, and prevent clotting by decreasing activation of thrombin and increasing that of plasmin. [...] Compression is applied using elastic bandages or boots specifically designed for the purpose.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives: {{to explore}} the {{hydrodynamic}} mechanisms involved in the regulation of ambulatory venous pressure. Design: an experimental model of calf <b>venous</b> <b>pump</b> was constructed with collapsible tubes and valves. Material: the model consisted of a conduit and a pump with an intervening competent valve. Another valve that could allow reflux into the pump was mounted above the pump. Methods: conduit pressure and recovery times were monitored under conditions of different degrees of ejection fraction and reflux into the pump. Model variables included using poorly compliant tubes for the pump, the conduit and for both the pump and conduit. Results: the latex tube exhibited a non-linear volume–pressure relationship and a bi-modal regimen of compliance. This bestowed pressure-buffering properties. Ambulatory venous hypertension resulted when reflux beyond buffering capacity occurred. Substituting less compliant PTFE for latex at the pump had a relatively minor effect on post-ejection pressure and recovery times. Using PTFE at the conduit had a profound but divergent effect on both of these parameters. Conduit capacitance reduction had a similar effect. Conclusion: conduit elastance {{plays a significant role}} in the regulation of ambulatory venous pressure in this experimental model. The hydrodynamic principles illustrated by the model may enhance our understanding of the human calf <b>venous</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. There {{are wide}} {{differences}} in flow between vascular beds at rest, even more during stress. The hydrodynamic energy (Energy grade line or EGL) of venous outflows must also vary considerably between vascular beds. We explored {{the mechanism of}} venous admixture of differing energy flows using a mechanical model. Materials and methods. The model simulated two venous flows coalescing at a venous junction and then flowing through collapsible <b>venous</b> <b>pumps.</b> Flow rates and pressures were monitored when the <b>venous</b> <b>pumps</b> were full (steady state) {{and when they were}} compressed and allowed to refill inducing wall motion (pump flow). Results. With increasing EGL differences between two coalescing venous flows, reduction or cessation (venous flow restriction) of the weaker flow occurred during steady state; higher base EGL of both flows ameliorated venous flow restriction and lower base EGL the opposite. Outflow obstruction favoured <b>venous</b> flow restriction. <b>Pump</b> action {{in the vicinity of the}} venous junction abolished venous flow restriction and maximized both venous flows. Conclusion. The model suggests a pivotal role for vein wall motion in venous admixture and regional perfusion. Observations in the model are explained on the basis of network flow principles and collapsible tube mechanics...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundPrevious {{studies have}} shown that {{so-called}} progressive elastic compression stockings (PECS) with a negative pressure gradient have a more pronounced effect on <b>venous</b> <b>pump</b> function than conventional, graduated stockings. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of higher graduated and non-graduated pressures on the venous calf pump in patients with venous disease. MethodsThe ejection fraction (EF) of the calf pump was measured by plethysmography under a standardized walking test in 20 patients suffering from chronic venous disease (CEAP C 2 –C 5) without compression, (a) with one and (b) two PECS on top of each other, and (c) with one additional conventional stocking covering only the gaiter area to achieve a graduated high pressure profile. Interface pressure was measured in the gaiter area and on the calf. ResultsA significant improvement of EF compared with baseline was found with all three compression modalities. The two superimposed PECS, providing median pressures of 33  mmHg in the gaiter area and 46  mmHg at calf level, increased EF significantly up into the normal range. Increasing the gaiter pressure to 56  mmHg without changing the calf pressure did not result in further improvement. ConclusionsTwo PECS applied on top of each other lead to a maximal improvement of the <b>venous</b> <b>pump</b> function, which cannot be further improved by increasing the pressure in the gaiter area thereby restoring a graduated pressure profile...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the influence of regular health training on the venous blood flow in lower extremities and body composition in women over 50 years old. Twenty-four women of mean age 57. 9 (± 3. 43) years, randomly divided into three groups (Nordic walking, water aerobics, and non-training), participated in the study. The training lasted 8 weeks, with one-hour sessions twice a week. Dietary habits were not changed. Before and after training vein refilling time and the function of the <b>venous</b> <b>pump</b> of the lower extremities were measured by photoplethysmography. Body composition was determined by bioelectrical impedance. Eight weeks of Nordic walking training improved the venous blood flow in lower extremities and normalized body composition in the direction of reducing chronic venous disorder risk factors. The average values of the refilling time variable (p = 0. 04, p = 0. 02, respectively) decreased in both the right and the left leg. After training a statistically significant increase in the <b>venous</b> <b>pump</b> function index was found only in the right leg (p = 0. 04). A significant increase in fat-free mass, body cell mass and total body water was observed (p = 0. 01), whereas body mass, the body mass index, and body fat decreased (p < 0. 03).

40|$|AIM: During {{lower limb}} immobilization, {{patients}} {{are at risk}} to develop deep venous thrombosis. Recently, a water-pad was developed that should counteract venous stasis. The water-pad, located under the plaster, mobilizes water from the foot to the calf during weight bearing and, thereby, imitates muscle pump function. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effect of the water-pad on <b>venous</b> <b>pump</b> function in healthy individuals. METHODS: In 21 healthy subjects (10 men and 11 women) both legs were plastered. <b>Venous</b> <b>pump</b> function was assessed by plethysmography measuring lower leg venous ejection fraction and volume. Subjects were tilted from the supine position to upright standing to determine total venous volume. Hereafter, stepping was performed to measure venous ejection fraction and volume under different filling conditions of the water-pad (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mL). Different sizes of water-pads (small, medium and large) were applied to each plastered leg in order to test the effectiveness and to relate optimum size to anthropometrical data. RESULTS: The venous ejection fraction increased significantly from 30 +/- 17 % to a maximum of 42 +/- 19 % during stepping with increasing filling condition (RM anova; P = 0. 009). Ejection volume also enhanced significantly during stepping with increasing filling condition from 1. 3 +/- 0. 7 to 1. 9 +/- 0. 9 mL (100 mL) (- 1) (RM ANOVA; P = 0. 006). The optimal filling condition of the water-pad depended on the water-pad size, while body height was the best predictive value for the water-pad size (Pearson's R = 0. 72, P < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: The filled water-pad markedly increased the venous ejection fraction and volume of the lower leg during stepping, hereby counteracting stasis of venous blood in the immobilized lower leg. Therefore, the water-pad seems to be a promising tool to prevent deep venous thrombosis during periods of lower leg immobilization...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveMeasuring venous {{refilling}} time by photoplethysmography {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used methods in venous diagnostics. Numerous studies have been done in adults to investigate its suitability to assess the overall <b>venous</b> calf <b>pump</b> function and to discriminate healthy subjects from patients with venous disease. The present study investigated any changes in the behavior of <b>venous</b> calf <b>pump</b> function from childhood to adulthood in subjects with healthy veins. MethodsThe study population consisted of 73 healthy (CEAP clinical classes C 0 and C 1) subjects (52 females, 21 males) who were all of the same age group (10 to 12 years old). It was a representative selection of the participants in a comprehensive longitudinal vein study known as the Bochum study (BO). The data of this study were obtained from (original) pupils of 11 secondary schools in the city of Bochum, Germany at four different periods (BO I 1982 - 1983, 10 to 12 years; BO II 1986 - 1987, 14 to 16 years; BO III 1991, 18 to 20 years; and BO IV 2001 - 2002, 29 to 31 years), 1990 ResultsThe distribution patterns of venous refilling time showed a successive shift to the right from childhood to adulthood. The distribution peak was in the range of 10. 1 to 20 seconds in BO I, broadened to 10. 1 to 30 seconds in BO II, and changed to 40. 1 to 50 seconds in BO III and BO IV. The median values increased from 24 seconds to more than 45 seconds. When we compared the two subgroups classified as C 0 and C 1, there was no significant difference in the behavior of their venous refilling time. ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first time the physiologic changes of <b>venous</b> calf <b>pump</b> function have been documented in a longitudinal study in young volunteers with healthy veins. The median venous refilling time successively lengthened, corresponding to a maturing of the <b>venous</b> calf <b>pump</b> function during adolescence and then stayed on a stable level.

40|$|BackgroundIt {{is widely}} {{believed}} {{that the loss of}} compression pressure of inelastic bandages is associated with a loss of efficacy in contrast to elastic material, which maintains its pressure and performance. This study compared the effect exerted by inelastic bandages vs elastic compression stockings on the <b>venous</b> <b>pumping</b> function in patients with severe superficial venous insufficiency immediately after application and 1 week later. MethodsEjection fraction (EF) of the calf pump was measured in 18 patients presenting with bilateral reflux in the great saphenous vein (CEAP C 3 -C 5) without any compression and immediately after application of an inelastic bandage on one leg and an elastic compression stocking on the other leg. Measurements were repeated 1 week later, before compression removal. EF was measured using a plethysmographic technique. The changes of interface pressure of the applied compression products were recorded simultaneously with EF measurements. ResultsAfter application, bandages and stockings achieved a significant improvement of EF (P <. 001) that was much more pronounced in the bandaged legs. The median resting pressure was 45 mm Hg (interquartile range, 41 - 48. 5 mm Hg) under the stockings and 64. 5 mm Hg (interquartile range, 51 - 80 mm Hg) under the bandages. After 1 week, EF was still significantly improved in the bandaged leg (P <. 001), but not under the stockings. At this time, the pressure under the stockings was only slightly reduced (5. 9 % supine, 3. 6 % standing), but the mean pressure loss under the bandages was much higher (54. 3 % supine, 35. 4 % standing). ConclusionThe findings supporting inelastic compression are important in explaining the benefits of its use in chronic venous insufficiency. Inelastic bandages maintain their superior efficacy on the <b>venous</b> <b>pumping</b> function after a wearing time of 1 week, despite a significant loss of pressure...|$|R

DesignExperimental study. Material 30 patients with severe superficial chronic venous insufficiency were enrolled. Two elastic stocking designs exerting a pressure at ankle between 15 and 25  mm Hg were compared; a conventional GECS and a stocking exerting a higher pressure over the calf than over the ankle producing a “progressive” increase in compression (PECS).

40|$|AbstractObjective: to {{determine}} the role of digital photoplethysmography (D-PPG) in the diagnosis of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), {{in comparison to the}} “gold standard” of either contrast ascending venography (ACV) or colour-flow duplex imaging (CFDI). Method: prospective study of 100 hospital inpatients (103 legs) referred to the X-ray department for ACV or CFDI with clinically suspected lower limb DVT in a district general hospital. Each patient was assessed by either ACV or CFDI, and D-PPG. Results: thirty-seven limbs were found to have DVT as demonstrated by ACV or CFDI. All patients with a venous refilling time (RT) of greater than 20 s and <b>venous</b> <b>pump</b> (VP) of greater than 35 had a normal ACV or CFDI. Using RT of less than 21 s as the optimal cut-off point, D-PPG achieved a sensitivity of 100 %, negative-predictive value of 100 %, specificity of 47 % and positive-predictive value of 51 %. By using VP of less than 36 as the optimal cut-off point, a sensitivity of 100 %, a negative-predictive value of 100 %, a specificity of 35 % and positive-predictive value of 46 % were achieved. Conclusions: these results validate the use of portable D-PPG as a useful screening tool for the diagnosis of clinically suspected lower limb DVT. A positive test requires further confirmation by one of the “gold standard” methods, whereas a negative test effectively excludes DVT...|$|E

MethodsIn 25 patients with mixed-etiology leg ulcers who received inelastic bandages applied with pressures from 20 to 30, 31 to 40, and 41 to 50 mm Hg, the following measurements were performed before and after bandage application to ensure patient safety throughout the investigation: laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF) close to the ulcer under the bandage and at the great toe, transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPo 2) on the dorsum of the foot, and toe pressure. Ejection fraction (EF) of the <b>venous</b> <b>pump</b> was performed to assess efficacy on venous hemodynamics. ResultsLDF values under the bandages increased by 33 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 17 - 48; P 41 mm Hg.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Postthrombotic {{syndrome}} (PTS) {{develops in}} 40 % to 60 % {{of patients with}} deep venous thrombosis. Factors {{that are important in}} the development of PTS include venous reflux, deep vein obstruction, and calf muscle pump dysfunction (CMD). Methods: Reflux and CMD in relationship to the severity of PTS were evaluated in a 2 -year follow-up study of patients with acute deep venous thrombosis. Duplex scanning was used to measure reflux. The supine <b>venous</b> <b>pump</b> function test (SVPT) measures CMD with strain-gauge plethysmography. The base-line examination was performed within 1 to 5 days after diagnosis. The next examinations were scheduled at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Results: The study included 86 legs, and the 2 -year follow-up period was completed for 70 legs. Significantly more reflux was found in previously thrombosed vein segments, with an odds ratio of 1. 8 after 3 months, of 2. 1 after 6 months, of 2. 5 after 12 months, and of 3. 2 after 24 months. Multiple regression results showed that the most important risk factor for early clinical signs of PTS was superficial reflux in months 3, 6, and 12 (P ≤. 02). Deep reflux did not have a synergistic relationship with superficial reflux in correlation with the clinical signs of PTS. The SVPT was not able to predict the development of PTS. Conclusion: More reflux develops in previously thrombosed vein segments. As early as after the third month, patients with superficial reflux have an increased risk of development of the first clinical signs of PTS. Within 2 years, the SVPT shows no relationship with clinical signs of PTS. (J Vasc Surg 2002; 35 : 1184 - 9. ...|$|E

Methods: A total of 60 patients with AD who were admitted in our hospital from October, 2014 to October, 2016 for THR {{were included in the}} study and randomized into the observation group and the control group with 30 cases in each group. Strict preoperative preparation was performed. The patients in the two groups were given intravenous injection of midazolam (0. 04 mg/kg), propofol (0. 5 – 1. 5 mg/kg), cisatracurium (0. 15 mg/kg), and fentanyl (4 μg/kg) for anesthesia induction, continuously <b>venous</b> <b>pumping</b> of propofol [1. 5 – 2. 5 mg/(kg·h) ] and remifentanil [0. 04 – 0. 4 μg/(kg·min) ] in maintaining the anesthesia depth, and cisatracurium for intermittent muscle relaxation. The patients in the observation group were given <b>venous</b> <b>pumping</b> of dexmedetomidine (1 μg/kg) 15 min before anesthesia induction, and dexmedetomidine [0. 2 – 0. 7 μg/(kg·h) ] for maintenance until the end of operation. The peripheral venous blood before operation, the time immediately after operation, 12 and 24 h after operation in the two groups was collected. ELISA was used to detect CRP, IL- 6, and TNF-α. FCM was used to detect T lymphocyte subsets (CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 +). CD 4 +/CD 8 + was calculated. Ramsay sedation grading was performed before operation, the time immediately after operation, 12 and 24 h after operation. Results: Ramsay sedation score the time immediately after operation and 12 h after operation in the observation group was significantly greater than that in the control group (P< 0. 05). The serum CRP, IL- 6, and TNF-α levels the time immediately after operation, 12 and 24 h after operation in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P< 0. 05).

40|$|AbstractObjectives: The {{proliferation}} of minimally invasive cardiac surgery has increased dependence on augmented venous return techniques for cardiopulmonary bypass. Such augmented techniques {{have the potential}} to introduce venous air emboli, which can pass to the patient. We examined the potential for the transmission of air emboli with different augmented venous return techniques. Methods: In vitro bypass systems with augmented venous drainage were created with either kinetically augmented or vacuum-augmented venous return. Roller or centrifugal pumps were used for arterial perfusion in combination with a hollow fiber oxygenator and a 40 -μm arterial filter. Air was introduced into the venous line via an open 25 -gauge needle. Test conditions involved varying the amount of negative venous pressure, the augmented venous return technique, and the arterial pump type. Measurements were recorded at the following sites: pre-arterial pump, post-arterial pump, post-oxygenator, and patient side. Results: Kinetically augmented venous return quickly filled the centrifugal <b>venous</b> <b>pump</b> with macrobubbles requiring continuous manual clearing; a steady state to test for air embolism could not be achieved. Vacuum-augmented venous return handled the air leakage satisfactorily and microbubbles per minute were measured. Higher vacuum pressures resulted in delivery of significantly more microbubbles to the “patient” (P <. 001). The use of an arterial centrifugal pump was associated with fewer microbubbles (P =. 02). Conclusions: Some augmented venous return configurations permit a significant quantity of microbubbles to reach the patient despite filtration. A centrifugal pump has air-handling disadvantages when used for kinetic venous drainage, but when used as an arterial pump in combination with vacuum-assisted venous drainage it aids in clearing air emboli.

40|$|Venous reflux is {{the most}} common cause of venous hemodynamic disorders. In this paper 2 issues are discussed: how and where does reflux arise and what are the hemodynamic conse-quences of {{retrograde}} flow. Pressure gradient and incompetent vein connecting both poles of the gradient are the prerequisite for venous reflux to arise. Ambulatory pressure gradient occurs during the activity of the calf muscle <b>venous</b> <b>pump</b> between deep veins of the thigh and the lower leg. Thus the incompetent reflux-carrying vein must connect the popliteal, femoral, profunda femoris, or iliac vein with 1 of the deep veins of the lower leg. Reflux can be consid-ered as shunting of blood from thigh veins into the lower leg veins. The most frequently found incompetent veins are the long and short saphenous veins and perforators communicating with deep veins of the thigh. On the other hand, calf perforators emptying into the deep veins of the lower leg, where the lower pole of the pressure gradient is located, cannot be the feeding source of reflux. A physiological bidirectional flow takes place in calf perforators connecting superficial and deep veins of the lower leg and making them conjoined vessels. Venous reflux produces ambulatory venous hypertension. The quantity of reflux volume and not the localization of retrograde flow in superficial or deep veins {{is the most}} important hemo-dynamic factor. Reflux in superficial veins, when large enough, can cause the most serious symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency including leg ulcers. Plethysmographic findings have shown that incompetence of the femoral and calf perforating veins is hemodynamically unim-portant. Large incompetent calf perforators are not the cause of venous abnormality but are the consequence of saphenous retrograde flow...|$|E

The subjects consisted of a control group (Co-gr, n = 9) and an exercise countermeasure group (CM-gr, n = 9). Calf volume and vein cross-sectional area (CSA) were assessed by plethysmography and echography during pre- and post-HDT stand-tests. From supine to standing (post-HDT), the tibial and gastrocnemius vein CSA increased significantly in intolerant subjects (tibial vein, + 122 % from pre-HDT; gastrocnemius veins, + 145 %; P < 0. 05) whereas it did not in tolerant subjects. Intolerant subjects tended to have a higher increase in calf filling volume than tolerant subjects, in both sitting and standing positions. The countermeasure did not reduce OI. Absolute calf volume decreased similarly in both groups. Tibial and gastrocnemius vein CSA at rest did not change during HDT in either group. During the post-HDT stand-test, the calf filling volume increased more in the CM-gr than in the Co-gr both in the sitting (+ 1. 3 +/- 5. 1 %, vs. - 7. 3 +/- 4. 3 %; P < 0. 05) and the standing positions (+ 56. 1 +/- 23. 7 % vs. + 1. 6 +/- 9. 6 %; P < 0. 05). The volume ejected by the muscle <b>venous</b> <b>pump</b> increased only in the CM-gr (+ 38. 3 +/- 21. 8 %). This study showed that intolerant subjects had a higher increase in vein CSA in the standing position and a tendency to present a higher calf filling volume in the sitting and standing positions.

30|$|Oedema {{indicates}} a malfunction of the circulatory system. Arterial pressure causes blood to {{flow to the}} arm, and a pumping mechanism is needed for the return flow of venous blood and lymphatic fluid [2]. Simons et al. [10] demonstrated three synergistic independent <b>venous</b> <b>pumping</b> systems in the hand: the superficial palmar, deep palmar and dorsal veins, which are activated by palm compression, isometric intrinsic muscle contraction and dorsal compression. Normal movements of the hand and arm provide the impetus to push the fluid towards the axilla, through numerous valves in the afferent vessels. Postoperatively, these normal movements cease or are inhibited, and the pneumatic compression device mimics the natural physiological process that maintains the blood circulation. Kilgour et al. [11] demonstrated that the forearm vascular resistance measured by electrical impedance plethysmography drops after local hand cooling during the first 30 s of cooling, and then gradually rises to reach peak levels between 5 and 6 min of cooling. This study shows that the A-V impulse system is significantly more effective than cryotherapy {{in the treatment of}} postoperative oedema of the hand. Berlin et al.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{validate}} a new non-invasive photoplethysmography (PPG) method for measuring relative changes in local muscle blood flow (MBF) in the human leg. Experimental conditions expected to impede or increase local MBF were used to test responsiveness of the PPG. 	The PPG method for monitoring blood flow in muscle following arterial occlusion and isometric and concentric contractions was validated (Study I). Invasive single-fibre laser-Doppler flowmetry {{was used as a}} reference method. MBF increased significantly after arterial occlusion and following isometric and concentric contractions, as measured with both methods. Skin blood flow increased significantly after arterial occlusion but did not change significantly after muscle contractions. The effects of limb elevation and increased intramuscular pressure (IMP) on MBF and leg neuromuscular function were investigated (Study II). MBF decreased significantly, by 50 %, and perfusion pressure was reduced from 65 mmHg to 17 mmHg when IMP was elevated to 40 mmHg by venous obstruction (elevated casted leg). Subjects experienced sensory dysfunction and muscular weakness only in the elevated leg. Study III examined whether or not PPG could detect MBF changes in response to exercise during elevated IMP and under conditions of normal IMP. MBF at rest after exercise was significantly lower when IMP was elevated compared to normal IMP. Study IV evaluated the ability of PPG to measure MBF during foot-transmitted vibration exposure. The filtering technique applied produced a marked reduction of the vibration-induced artefacts on the PPG signal, thus making it possible to measure MBF during vibration exposure. In Study V, changes in MBF following concentric muscular activity or leg activation with a <b>venous</b> foot <b>pump</b> were compared. MBF increased significantly following concentric muscular activity, but not following leg activation by the <b>venous</b> foot <b>pump.</b> MBF was significantly greater in the exercised leg compared with the leg exposed to the <b>venous</b> foot <b>pump</b> during <b>venous</b> obstruction. 	In conclusion, photoplethysmography, {{with the aid of a}} custom-designed probe, enables non-invasive, continuous assessment of relative changes in local MBF in response to, for example, arterial occlusion, muscle contractions, and increased intramuscular pressure. The PPG technique is a promising non-invasive diagnostic tool for direct measurement of local MBF under clinical conditions with and without abnormally elevated IMP.

Therefore, a tilt table with integrated stepping device (tilt stepper) was developed, which allows passive stepping movements for performing locomotion training in an early state of rehabilitation. The aim of this pilot {{study was to investigate}} if passive stepping and cycling movements of the legs during tilt table training could stabilize blood circulation and prevent neurally-mediated syncope in healthy young adults. Methods In the first experiment, healthy subjects were tested on a traditional tilt table. Subjects who had a syncope or near-syncope in this condition underwent a second trial on the tilt stepper. In the second experiment, a group of healthy subjects was investigated on a traditional tilt table, the second group on the tilt ergometer, a device that allows cycling movements during tilt table training. We used the chi-square test to compare the occurrence of near-syncope/syncope in both groups (tilt table/tilt stepper and tilt table/tilt ergometer) and ANOVA to compare the blood pressure and heart rate between the groups at the four time intervals (supine, at 2 minutes, at 6 minutes and end of head-up tilt). Results Separate chi-square tests performed for each experiment showed significant differences in the occurrence of near syncope or syncope based on the device used. Comparison of the two groups (tilt stepper/ tilt table) in experiment one (ANOVA) showed that blood pressure was significantly higher at the end of head-up tilt on the tilt stepper and on the tilt table there was a greater increase in heart rate (2 minutes after head-up tilt). Comparison of the two groups (tilt ergometer/tilt table) in experiment 2 (ANOVA) showed that blood pressure was significantly higher on the tilt ergometer at the end of head-up tilt and on the tilt table the increase in heart rate was significantly larger (at 6 min and end of head-up tilt). Conclusions Stabilization of blood circulation and prevention of benign syncope can be achieved by passive leg movement during a tilt table test in healthy adults. </p...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} therefore to evaluate the distribution of temperature and the dynamics of venous blood flow in the lower limbs (LLs) and to assess the interdependence of these parameters in terms of the somatic components in males and females participating in activities at the University of the Third Age. Materials and methods: The study included 60 females (mean age 67. 4  years) and 40 males (mean age 67. 5  years). A body composition assessment was performed using the bioimpedance technique – Tanita BC- 418 MA. The following parameters were examined: fat%, fat mass, fat-free mass, and total body water. The minimal, maximal, and mean temperature values and their distributions were examined using infrared thermographic camera VarioCAM Head. Measurements of the venous refilling time and the work of the LL <b>venous</b> <b>pump</b> were examined using a Rheo Dopplex II PPG. Results: In males, the mean value of the right LL temperature was 30. 58 and the mean value of the left LL was 30. 28; the P-value was 0. 805769. In females, the mean value of the right LL temperature was 29. 58 and the mean value of the left limb was 29. 52; the P-value was 0. 864773. In males, the right limb blood flow was 34. 17 and the left limb blood flow was 34. 67; the P-value was 0. 359137. In females, the right limb blood flow was 26. 89 and the left limb blood flow was 26. 09; the P-value was 0. 796348. Conclusion: Research results showed that the temperature distribution and the dynamics of blood flow are not significantly different between the right and left extremities in both males and females. However, significant temperature {{differences were found between the}} gender groups. Significantly higher temperature values in both the right and left extremities were recorded in males than in females. Keywords: thermovision, lower limb, blood circulatio...|$|E
40|$|Graduated {{compression}} {{devices are}} considered the standard care for management of venous and lymphatic disorders. Recently compression devices exerting a pressure over the calf higher than over the ankle have been {{proved to be more}} effective than traditional graduated devices in increasing the impaired ejection fraction (EF) from the lower leg in patients with venous disease. Aim of this work is presenting an overview of the new concept on progressive compression, its potential benefits and limits. In different series of tests, the EF from the lower leg was assessed in 70 patients with severe reflux in the great saphenous vein (GSV). EF was measured by strain gauge plethysmography, in baseline conditions and after applying graduated compression devices or the new inversely graduated or progressive compression (PC) devices. The interface pressure was recorded, simultaneously with the EF, both in the gaiter area (B 1 point) and at the calf (C point) in order to assess the compression pressure profile. EF, severely impaired in patients with GSV reflux, was increased by compression. So called PC devices (both PC elastic stocking and PC inelastic bandages) were significantly more effective than graduated compression in increasing the ejection fraction. The higher the pressure on the calf the higher the EF improvement. Maintaining the same strong pressure over the calf by means of two progressive stockings and increasing the pressure only over the calf to restore a graduated compression didn’t improve the EF. To improve <b>venous</b> <b>pumping</b> function in the ambulant patient stronger compression of the calf is more effective than graduated compression.

40|$|International audienceMechanical {{devices for}} the {{prevention}} of venous thromboembolism (VTE) act on venous stasis and include static systems: the graduated compression stockings (or elastic stockings or anti-embolism stockings) and dynamical systems: intermittent pneumatic compression and <b>venous</b> foot <b>pump.</b> The main advantage of these devices is that they have no risk of bleeding. If the prevention of VTE is based primarily on drug prophylaxis, mechanical devices are recommended primarily for patients with high risk of bleeding, if there is contraindication to anticoagulants. Alone or in combination with drug prophylaxis, their efficacy on deep vein thrombosis prevention is well documented in surgery, but the evidence is insufficient {{for the prevention}} of pulmonary embolism and in other settings. Their interest in stroke is called into question after the results of the CLOTS 1 and 2 studies. These results, beyond the context of stroke, have raised numerous questions about the real benefit/risk ratio of mechanical devices {{for the prevention of}} VTE.

MethodsIn 20 patients, all affected by greater saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence and candidates for surgery (Clinical, etiologic, anatomic and pathophysiologic data, CEAP C 2 -C 5), the ejection fraction of the <b>venous</b> calf <b>pump</b> was measured using a plethysmographic method during a standardised walking test without compression, with GCB and NGCB, all composed of the same short-stretch material.

40|$|The {{survey of}} how Canadian {{intensive}} care units (ICUs) prevent and diagnose venous thromboembolism (VTE) {{presented in this}} issue of Critical Care illustrates considerable variability. Lack of optimal patient care reflects how VTE is rated in ICUs. The discussion should no longer focus on the incidence of thrombosis, but rather on its prevention. Unfractionated heparin remains the most commonly used agent to prevent VTE, despite the recognized efficacy and safety of low-molecularweight heparins (LMWHs) in the ICU setting. In addition, too few ICU directors consider the use of mechanical prophylactic measures, such as graded elastic stockings and <b>venous</b> foot <b>pump.</b> The present situation calls for large randomized controlled trials in either medical or surgical ICU patients, and for new education programmes in order to modify the care of ICU patients with regard to VTE.

50|$|Pharmacological (warfarin, unfractionated heparin, low {{molecular}} weight heparin) and mechanical measures (graded compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression devices, and <b>venous</b> foot <b>pumps)</b> are used to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in clinical practice. For {{cases in which the}} bleeding risk is high and pharmacologic measures are contraindicated, the use of mechanical prophylaxis is recommended. Graduated compression stockings can effectively prevent VTE in hospitalized patients by applying different pressure to the leg. The meta-analysis of general surgical patients revealed that graduated compression stockings decreased their risk of developing VTE by 68% compared to placebo. Nineteen randomized controlled trials analyzed the effectiveness of graduated compression stockings alone or with other additional prophylaxis in prevention of deep vein thrombosis. These trials included 1681 patients after general surgery, orthopedic surgery, and medical patients. They concluded that graduated compression stockings are effective in deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis in post-surgical patients. Combining graduated compression stockings with other mechanical and pharmacological measures can increase the effectiveness of VTE prophylaxis by 60%. However, another study performed in France involved 407 ICU patients and showed no difference in the effectiveness of the VTE prevention for patients who used compression stockings alone or in combination with intermittent pneumatic devices.|$|R
40|$|IntroductionElastic {{compression}} stockings exerting {{a progressive}} pressure, higher at the calf {{than at the}} ankle (progressive elastic compression stockings, PECS), have already {{proved to be more}} comfortable, easier to put on and more effective in improving <b>venous</b> <b>pumping</b> function compared to graduated compression elastic stockings (GECS). Nevertheless, PECS could {{have a negative effect on}} the prevention and treatment of oedema or even favour oedema formation. The aim of the present study was to investigate if, in normal volunteers, PECS are able to prevent leg swelling during their working shift. MethodsA total of 30 normal volunteers (14 males, 16 females aged 36. 4  ±  6. 6 years) staying standing or sitting during their shift were enrolled into the study. Their leg volume was measured at the beginning and at the end of their working shift on 2 consecutive days. On one day, the volunteers did not put on any stockings; on the other day, they wore GECS on one leg and PECS on the other. The difference between the leg volume measured at the end of the shift and the basal volume in the morning was called ‘occupational oedema’. Interface pressure at points B 1 and C was measured immediately after stockings' application and before removal. The volunteers were asked to report about difficulty of putting on the stockings and comfort during wearing time. The results were submitted to statistical analysis. ResultsThe GECS and PECS groups had similar baseline leg volumes (3143 vs. 3154  ml) and occupational oedema (134 vs. 137. 5  ml); after putting on the stockings, occupational oedema was reduced in both legs but the reduction was significantly greater with PECS (20 vs. 40  ml with GECS) (P <  0. 05). Interface pressure at ankle level is higher with GECS both in supine and in standing position while at calf level it is higher with PECS both in supine and standing position. PECS are easier to put on and slightly more comfortable. ConclusionPECS are easier to put on and more comfortable and produce a significantly higher reduction of occupational oedema compared with GECS in normal volunteers. Nevertheless leg volumetry, providing a global leg-volume evaluation, is not able to localise the oedema reduction and to assess if it occurs more in the calf or the ankle area. Theoretically, despite a global volume reduction, PECS could even promote a slight oedema formation at ankle level over-compensated by a greater oedema reduction at calf level. Further studies need to concentrate on patients with venous disease and on the local distribution of this global effect...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were firstly to review several {{techniques}} {{used to assess}} <b>venous</b> calf muscle <b>pump</b> function and to establish {{the relative importance of}} venous incompetence in different sites. Secondly to investigate venous elasticity in varicose limbs using a new method and thirdly to examine the effect of compression stockings on venous elasticity and venous valvular function.;Ambulatory venous pressure measurement showed strong agreement with the clinical severity of venous disease. The use of narrow tourniquets in combination with this technique was not helpful however in predicting the effect of venous surgery, indeed the technique did not differentiate deep from superficial reflux. Duplex scanning demonstrated that the tourniquets did not obstruct superficial venous flow as previously claimed. Air-plethysmography failed to distinguish between patients with venous disease of varied severity nor did the volume measurements agree with pressure measurement as previously claimed.;Statistical analysis of reflux patterns in 274 limbs found popliteal reflux to have the greatest clinical importance, followed by long saphenous reflux. Venous elasticity measurement showed reduced elasticity in varicose limbs at low distension pressures. Major surgery did not alter venous elasticity, but compression stockings produced an improvement. Duplex scanning showed that compression stockings reduced venous reflux but did not restore competence to incompetent veins.;In conclusion, ambulatory venous pressure remains the reference standard test of <b>venous</b> calf muscle <b>pump</b> function. The addition of tourniquets is unhelpful as is air-plethysmography. The popliteal and the long saphenous veins are the most important when considering a mixed pattern of venous reflux.
