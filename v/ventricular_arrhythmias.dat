40|$|<b>Ventricular</b> <b>{{arrhythmia}}</b> {{is common}} after repair of tetralogy of Fallot. Such arrhythmia could {{be caused by}} damage at surgical repair {{or it could be}} part of the course of the disease. Fifty patients, 32 aged 1 - 7 years and 18 aged 13 - 43 years at surgical repair, underwent 24 hour electrocardiographic monitoring before and 2 - 75 (mean 44) months after repair. Before operation none of the younger group had appreciable <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia,</b> whereas <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> was already present in eight (45 %) of 18 patients in the older group. At follow up <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> was present in four patients from the younger group and seven from the older group. Three of these four younger patients had had insertion of a conduit from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery or reoperation. Six of the seven older patients had had appreciable <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> before operation. New <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> developed in only two (5 %) of the 43 patients who had uncomplicated repair of tetralogy of Fallot. Thus the high frequency of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> after repair of tetralogy of Fallot cannot be attributed to the effect of operation alone because in the majority of patients it was already present before operation.

40|$|Background: Sympathetic tone {{may be an}} {{underlying}} mechanism in the occurrence of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> from right <b>ventricular</b> outflow tract (RVOT). Objectives: To assess the difference in heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> from RVOT compared to control group. Methods: We studied HRV from ambulatory monitoring in patients with <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> from right <b>ventricular</b> outflow tract and control group who were requested for ambulatory monitoring during the same study period. <b>Ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> from right <b>ventricular</b> outflow tract must be more than 1000 PVC in 24 hours to be enrolled in the study. Parameters for autonomic tone acquired from ambulatory monitoring were average heart rate, standard deviation of all normal RR intervals (SDNN), standard deviation of average of normal RR intervals every 5 minute (SDANN). Results: A total of 62 patients with <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> from right <b>ventricular</b> outflow tract and 101 controls were studied. Females are predominant (71 %). Average age was 53 years.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{review the}} {{efficacy}} of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABCP) in medically refractory <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia.</b>  DESIGN—Retrospective analysis {{of the outcome of}} patients with <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> treated with IABCP after transfer between 1992  and 1997.  SETTING—Tertiary cardiac referral centre.  PATIENTS— 21 patients (mean age 58  years) who underwent IABCP for control of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia.</b> All had significant left ventricular impairment (mean ejection fraction 28. 6 %); 18  had coronary artery disease.  RESULTS—Before IABCP, 10  patients had incessant monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and 11  had paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF). IABCP resulted in suppression of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> in 18  patients, of whom 13  were weaned from IABCP. After stabilisation of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia,</b> 10  patients were maintained on medical treatment alone and one underwent endocardial resection. IABCP was maintained until cardiac transplantation in five patients. One patient had a fatal arrest before discharge and one died from progressive heart failure. IABCP failed to control <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> in three patients and was subsequently discontinued. A cardiac assist device was employed in one of these until cardiac transplantation; the other two were eventually stabilised on medical treatment. Nineteen patients were discharged from hospital. Overall survival was 95 % at mean follow up of 25. 7  months.  CONCLUSIONS—IABCP can be an effective means of controlling refractory <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia,</b> allowing time for the institution of more definitive treatment.    Keywords: ventricular arrhythmia; intra-aortic balloon counterpulsatio...|$|R

40|$|A {{hallmark}} {{of cardiovascular disease}} is cardiac autonomic dysregulation. The phenotype of impaired parasympathetic responsiveness and sympathetic hyperactivity in experimental animal models is also well documented in large scale human studies {{in the setting of}} heart failure and myocardial infarction, and is predictive of morbidity and mortality.

25|$|Dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DCM) is {{a disease}} of heart muscle resulting in decreased myocardial contractility. The left ventricle compensates for this disease by growing larger (eccentric or volume overload hypertrophy; AKA dilation). The left atrial is also dilated when the disease is severe. It is seen in large/giant dog breeds such as Boxers, Great Danes, and Doberman Pinschers. It is usually idiopathic, but can also be caused by taurine deficiency in American Cocker Spaniels or doxorubicin use. A mutation in the gene that encodes for pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 is associated with DCM in Doberman Pinschers in the USA. Dilated cardiomyopathy usually ultimately results in congestive heart failure. Atrial fibrillation is common in giant breed dogs with DCM. Doberman Pinschers more commonly have <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> (e.g., premature ventricular complexes; ventricular tachycardia) that predispose them to sudden death (i.e., ventricular fibrillation).|$|E

After inverse probability of treatment weighting using a propensity score, the baseline characteristics of the comparison groups were similar. The primary outcome was a hospital encounter with <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> within 90 days of a new prescription, assessed using hospital diagnostic codes. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality within 90 days. RESULTS: Citalopram was associated with a higher risk of a hospital encounter with <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> compared with referent antidepressants (0. 06 % vs. 0. 04 %, relative risk [RR] 1. 53, 95 % confidence intervals [CI] 1. 03 to 2. 29), and a higher risk of mortality (3. 49 % vs. 3. 12 %, RR 1. 12, 95 % CI 1. 06 to 1. 18). Escitalopram was not associated with a higher risk of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> compared with the referent antidepressants (0. 03 % vs. 0. 04 %, RR 0. 84, 95 % CI 0. 42 to 1. 68), but was associated with a higher risk of mortality (2. 86 % vs. 2. 63 %, RR 1. 09, 95 % CI 1. 01 to 1. 18).
