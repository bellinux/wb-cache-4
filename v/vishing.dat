5000|$|Voice {{phishing}} is {{the criminal}} practice of using social engineering {{over the telephone}} system {{to gain access to}} private personal and financial information from the public for the purpose of financial reward. It is sometimes referred to as <b>vishing,</b> a word that is a combination of [...] "voice" [...] and phishing. Voice phishing exploits the public's trust in landline telephone services, which have traditionally terminated in physical locations known to the telephone company, and associated with a bill-payer.

50|$|Platform switch: Cybercrime is {{switching}} its battle {{ground from}} Windows-system PCs to other platforms, including mobile phones, tablet computers, and VoIP. Because a significant threshold in vulnerabilities has been reached. PC vendors are building better security into their products by providing faster updates, patches and user alert to potential flaws. Besides, global mobile devices’ penetration—from smart phones to tablet PCs—accessing the Internet by 2013 will surpass 1 billion, creating {{more opportunities for}} cybercrime. The massively successful banking Trojan, Zeus is already being adapted for the mobile platform. Smishing, or SMS phishing, is another method cyber criminals are using to exploit mobile devices, which users download after falling prey to a social engineering ploy, is designed to defeat the SMS-based two-factor authentication most banks use to confirm online funds transfers by customers. VoIP systems {{are being used to}} support <b>vishing</b> (telephone-based phishing) schemes, which are now growing in popularity.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{exploratory}} assessment of Phishing, SMiShing and <b>Vishing</b> attacks against mobile devices. It examines {{the implications of}} end-user behavior towards mitigating the risks posed by using mobile devices for online services and facilities. Phishing is that socially engineered attack aimed at enticing unsuspecting users with familiar websites spoofed and purported {{to come from a}} legitimate organization or source. It lures the user to furnish the assailant with the user’s access credentials, for which privileged access would be gained to harm the user. SMiShing attacks also happen whenever text messages are sent for the user to either click on a link provided, which leads to a fraudulent website or for the attacker to get access to the user’s contacts and/or any other confidential information. <b>Vishing</b> is a voice phishing attack, whereby a voice call received from an assailant lures the target into providing personal information with the intention to use that information to cause harm. With the proliferation of smart phones, tablets and hotspots, these social engineering attacks on mobile devices are now prevalent. The study observed and strategically interviewed 20 end-users for their knowledge, perceptions and behavior when confronted with phishing attack situations. The results show that men are more comfortable and trusting on the cyber-space and thus more susceptible to phishing attacks than women. The results also indicate that most users are either slightly aware or not at all aware of Phishing, SMiShing and <b>Vishing</b> threats against their mobile devices. Interestingly, 55 % would occasionally examine the messages received as perceived threats, whilst 35...|$|E

This is a new social engineering problem which makes our day to day life vulnerable and difficult. This investigation particularly focuses on phishing through email as it has more serious consequences directly related to financial transactions {{in comparison to the}} other methods. It is worth mentioning that securing the enormous amount of online transactions is very challenging since several methods are invented daily to breach individual privacy in order to steal their credentials. The cost of these types of attacks exceeds millions of dollars annually. Many tools are proposed to solve this problem; unfortunately, the dilemma still exists. This paper proposes a methodology to develop an intelligent tool and awareness security program to address the risk of this problem...|$|E

This paper tries to investigate the magnitude of online banking frauds in Nigerian commercial banks and proffer lasting solutions that will mitigate this contending and boiling issue in the Nigerian banking industry. The paper employs both primary and secondary data in order to investigate the online banking frauds in Nigerian banks.

The paper concludes that both bank customers and bankers have a joint role to play in stopping the perpetrators of online banking frauds in the banks. The research reveals that phishing attacks appear to be the dominant dimension of online banking frauds in Nigeria followed by fake web site substitution and pharming. While, <b>vishing</b> fraud is not a common phenomenon in Nigeria, it ranked lowest in the ranking of the dimensions...|$|E
40|$|Phishers {{nowadays}} rely on {{a variety}} of channels, ranging from old-fashioned emails to instant messages, social networks, and the phone system (with both calls and text messages), with the goal of reaching more victims. As a consequence, modern phishing became a multi-faceted, even more pervasive threat that is inherently more difficult to study than traditional, email-based phishing. This short paper describes the status of a data collection system we are developing to capture different aspects of phishing campaigns, with a particular focus on the emerging use of the voice channel. The general approach is to record inbound calls received on decoy phone lines, place outbound calls to the same caller identifiers (when available) and also to telephone numbers obtained from different sources. Specifically, our system analyzes instant messages (e. g., automated social engineering attempts) and suspicious emails (e. g., spam, phishing), and extracts telephone numbers, URLs and popular words from the content. In addition, users can voluntarily submit voice phishing (<b>vishing)</b> attempts through a public website. Extracted telephone numbers, URLs and popular words will be correlated to recognize campaigns by means of cross-channel relationships between messages...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{the number of}} mobile phones has {{increased}} dramatically, overtaking the world population in October 2014. In developing countries like India and China, mobile subscribers outnumber traditional landline users and account for over 90 % of the active population. At the same time, convergence of telephony with the Internet with technologies like VoIP {{makes it possible to}} reach a large number of telephone users at a low or no cost via voice calls or SMS (short message service) messages. As a consequence, cybercriminals are abusing the telephony channel to launch attacks, e. g., scams that offer fraudulent services and voice-based phishing or <b>vishing,</b> that have previously relied on the Internet. In this paper, we introduce and deploy the first mobile phone honeypot called MobiPot that allow us to collect fraudulent calls and SMS messages. We implement multiple ways of advertising mobile numbers (honeycards) on MobiPot to investigate how fraudsters collect phone numbers that are targeted by them. During a period of over seven months, MobiPot collected over two thousand voice calls and SMS messages, and we confirmed that over half of them were unsolicited. We found that seeding honeycards enables us to discover attacks on the mobile phone numbers which were not known before...|$|E
