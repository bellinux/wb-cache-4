40|$|AbstractA {{high-performance}} {{building envelope}} is the prerequisite and foundation to a zero energy building. For the non-transparent part of envelope, the thermal conductivity and <b>volumetric</b> heat <b>capacity</b> are two thermophysical properties which can strongly influence the energy {{performance of the}} envelope. Although a lot of case studies have been performed on these two properties, the results could not give a comprehensive picture of the roles of thermal conductivity and <b>volumetric</b> heat <b>capacity</b> on the energy performance in an active building. In this work, a traversal study on the energy performance of a standard room with all potential wall materials was provided. These materials were differentiated by distinct thermal conductivity and <b>volumetric</b> heat <b>capacity.</b> It was revealed that the external wall requires a material with a low thermal conductivity and a high <b>volumetric</b> heat <b>capacity,</b> and the internal wall needs a material with a high <b>volumetric</b> heat <b>capacity.</b> These requirements for wall materials are consistent under various climate conditions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{procedure}} {{was developed to}} calibrate the Calorimetry Sciences Corporation Models 5100 and 6100 Nano-DSCs to measure more precisely <b>volumetric</b> heat <b>capacities</b> of liquids and solutions. These calorimeters are small-volume, twin fixed-cell, power-compensation, differential-output instruments that can scan temperature upward or downward between 263 and 398 K at pressures up to 0. 4 MPa. The calibration procedure leads to <b>volumetric</b> heat <b>capacities</b> that have a relative precision and accuracy of 3 × 10 − 6 to 5 × 10 − 5 for aqueous solutions at concentrations between ca. 0. 001 and 1 mol kg− 1.
