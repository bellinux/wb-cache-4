25|$|As with manufacturing, Rio is an {{important}} financial centre, second only to São Paulo in <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> in financial markets and in banking. Its securities market, although declining in significance relative to São Paulo, is still of major importance. Owing to the proximity of Rio's port facilities, many of Brazil's export-import companies are headquartered in the city. In Greater Rio, which {{has one of the}} highest per capita incomes in Brazil, retail trade is substantial. Many of the most important retail stores are located in the Centre, but others are scattered throughout the commercial areas of the other districts, where shopping centres, supermarkets, and other retail businesses handle a large volume of consumer trade.|$|E
50|$|The 1970s {{also saw}} the first ever PATA Travel Mart in Manila (1978).

30|$|Many {{authors have}} argued that size brings economies of scale and {{accompanying}} cost reductions (Mitchell and Onvural 1996; Karray and Chichti 2013). This view {{is based on the}} belief that unavoidable costs, such as branding, commercial networks, information and communication technology (ICT), and regulatory expenses, are more easily absorbed through large <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> However, as highlighted earlier, the literature has instead documented a U-shaped nexus between bank size and the unit costs of banks. Moreover, large banks appear to work with more advanced technology, which potentially limits their economies of scale.|$|R

With {{the advent of the}} Internet and other information systems technologies, this process has rapidly become technology-centric, as businesses practising lead management techniques have shifted much of the prior manual workload to automation systems, though personal interaction with lead inquiries is still vital to success.|$|R

500|$|Sixty county {{courts in}} Wales have closed since the modern system of county courts in England and Wales was {{established}} by the County Courts Act 1846. The Act created 491 courts on 60 circuits; of these, 53 courts were in Wales and Monmouthshire, a Welsh county that had ambiguous status {{at the time and}} was sometimes treated as being in England. Since then, new courts have been opened in various locations, and 80 towns and cities in Wales have, or have had, county courts. As of 2012, there are 20 county courts in Wales. Reasons for closure have included a decision that it was [...] "inexpedient" [...] to continue to provide a court, the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> no longer justifying a court, or the state of the building housing the court. The first closure was Fishguard in 1856. The most recent closures are the county courts in Aberdare and Pontypool, which closed on 1 August 2011.|$|E
500|$|Whale's career {{went into}} sharp decline {{following}} {{the release of}} his next film, The Road Back (1937). The sequel to Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, which Universal had filmed in 1930, the novel and film follow the lives of several young German men who have returned from the trenches of World War I and their struggles to re-integrate into society. The Los Angeles consul for Nazi Germany, George Gyssling, learned that the film was in production. He protested to PCA enforcer Joseph Breen, arguing that the film gave an [...] "untrue and distorted picture of the German people". Gyssling eventually met Whale, but nothing came of it. Gyssling then sent letters {{to members of the}} cast, threatening that their participation in the film might lead to difficulties in obtaining German filming permits for them and for anyone associated in a film with them. While the low <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> conducted by Universal in Germany made such threats largely hollow, the State Department, under pressure from the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League and the Screen Actors Guild, stepped in and the German government backed down. Whale's original cut of the film was given generally positive reviews, but sometime between preview screenings and the film's general release, Rogers capitulated to the Germans, ordering that cuts be made and additional scenes be shot and inserted. Whale was furious, and the altered film was banned in Germany anyway. The Germans were successful in persuading China, Greece, Italy and Switzerland to ban the film as well.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{commerce}} is global, {{the products}} and services offered on the market are almost identical, {{and there is an}} abundance of suppliers. Due to the size and complexity of the markets, mass marketing is expensive and returns on related investments are frequently questionable.

Firms today are concerned with increasing customer value through analysis of the customer lifecycle. Analytics comprises all programming that analyzes data about an enterprise’s business activities and customer information and presents it so that better and quicker business decisions can be made. Modern e-commerce gathers <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> and transaction history data that contains business knowledge that is often not used to its full potential.

40|$|The World Wide Web has {{experienced}} phenomenal {{growth over the}} last few years. Although, at ifs inception, Web technology was primarily used to retrieve information stored in static documents, important current uses of the Web include retrieval of dynamically changing information and the conducting <b>of</b> <b>business</b> transactions. Such uses of the Web result in access to dynamically changing data on or through Web servers, usually stored in a database. Huge <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> data exist on mainframes and other mature platforms that cannot be moved to client/server or workstation-based platforms, due to cost or performance issues. Providing Web access to these legacy data, therefore, is of great commercial interest to businesses. In this paper, we survey several solutions that have been developed to access existing business data through the Web. We discuss the details of two solutions developed at IBM: DB 2 (R) (DATABASE 2 (TM)) World Wide Web Connection and Net. Data(TM). Each of these is a pure middleware approach as opposed to approaches that are integrated with either the Web server or the database management system, which accounts for their flexibility and power...|$|R

40|$|Many {{statistical}} and MOLAP applications use multidimensional arrays as {{the basic}} data structure to allow the efficient and convenient storage and retrieval <b>of</b> large <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> data for decision making. Allocation of data or data compression is a key performance factor for this purpose because performance strongly depends {{on the amount of}} storage required and availability of memory. This holds especially for data warehousing environments in which huge amounts of data have to be dealt with. The most evident consequence of data compression is that it reduces storage cost by packing more logical data per unit of physical capacity. And improved performance is a net outcome because less physical data need to be retrieved during scan-oriented queries. In this paper, an efficient data compression technique is proposed based on the notion of extendible array. The main idea of the scheme is to compress each of the segments of the extendible array using the position information only. We compare the proposed scheme for different performance issues with prominent compression schemes. </p...|$|R
