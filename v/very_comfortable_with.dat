25|$|Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Douglas {{was a major}} box-office star, playing {{opposite}} some of {{the leading}} actresses of that era. He played a frontier peace officer in his first western Along the Great Divide (1951). He quickly became <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> riding horses and playing gunslingers, and appeared in many westerns. He considers Lonely Are the Brave (1962), in which he plays a cowboy trying to live by his own code, as his personal favorite. The film, written by Dalton Trumbo, was respected by critics, but did not do well {{at the box office}} due to poor marketing and distribution.|$|E

Suddenly {{now we have}} a quite different situation which it seems to me, artists understand much better than recordcompanies do... oung artists are <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> starting their careers on Facebook or MySpace or something like that—and they're way ahead of the recordcompanies in some respects." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{just thought}} it wasn't right for me. As a team, we were playing great and you don't want to disrupt things like that. Individually, I {{was not ready to}} accept that {{responsibility}} quite yet. Going through the playoffs and having that experience has probably given me more confidence. I understand {{there is going to be}} a lot more responsibility on my shoulders with this, but it's something I'm ready for, I feel <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> it and I'm just excited to get things going." ...|$|E

50|$|Speakers {{must also}} present {{themselves}} to be likable since people {{are more inclined to}} trust those they generally like or feel <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> in a room. Being friendly, easy going, warmhearted, nice and kind can carry the speaker into a <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> space <b>with</b> the audience. Once the audience is at ease, the speaker can generally present their information, and it will be perceived positively.|$|R

500|$|In 2011, Moon {{accepted}} {{a deal to}} become Tour Ambassador for Heartland Poker Tour, wearing the patch of the nationally-televised tour and playing in several HPT events. HPT President Todd Anderson of Moon: [...] "Darvin is our kind of guy. He's worked hard his entire life and now lives the dream that attracts so many to the game." [...] Moon became a fan favorite among HPT's tour regulars when he declined an invitation for the November Nine taping in 2010 to play an HPT stop in Iowa. A last minute replacement for an ill Scotty Nguyen, Moon bonded with HPT’s crew and players. Moon said, [...] "I'm <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> the HPT folks. [...] They're like family." ...|$|E
2500|$|US Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jaczko, visiting Japan, {{confirmed}} that the Daiichi reactors were stable. [...] Said Jaczko, [...] "The temperatures have decreased significantly, the amount of heat that's being produced from the reactor fuel itself is very, very low now. [...] So it simply doesn't {{have the kind of}} energy, if you will, that's needed to have any kind of off-site releases of radiation. [...] I feel <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> the (government's cold shutdown) decision." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1868, he held {{discussions with}} the Prussians, {{intending}} to counter a possible Austrian alliance with Napoleon III by Franz Joseph. [...] If German forces were, for any reason, bogged down in the west, then Prussia's eastern and southern flanks would have been highly vulnerable. With his usual skill, Bismarck moved carefully to sidestep the nightmare. The Russian government {{even went so far}} as to promise to send an army of 100,000 men against the Austrians if Austria joined France in a war against Prussia. Whilst at Ems in the crucial summer of 1870 Wilhelm I and Bismarck had meetings with Tsar Alexander, also present in the spa town [...] Alexander, though not naturally pro-German, became <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> Prussian suggestions.|$|E

50|$|Rainbow is a <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> planet <b>with</b> a {{moderate}} climate, a calm atmosphere, little seismic activity and a rather phlegmatic native fauna. There {{is only one}} continent (in the Northern hemisphere) and some small archipelagos (in the South one, which is covered with an ocean). Remarkably, the coastal line between the southern ocean and the northern continent roughly coincides with the equator.|$|R

2500|$|Nimoy {{continued}} to develop Spock alongside individual directors. When work was underway on [...] "Amok Time", he discussed with Joseph Pevney how Vulcans would greet each other. Nimoy suggested {{the use of}} a hand signal from the Priestly Blessing as performed by Jewish Kohen. He had seen this as a child, although Nimoy's father had told him not to look as they performed the blessing. This became the basis for the Vulcan salute. Solow later said that Nimoy was the key contributor to the character's depiction, saying that the [...] "Mr Spock character was 20% created by Gene Roddenberry, 20% created by me and 60% created by Leonard Nimoy". Nimoy recalled, [...] "As a Jew from Catholic Boston, I understood {{what it was like to}} feel alienated, apart from the mainstream... there were a number of values in Star Trek that I felt <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> as a Jew". The character influenced Nimoy as well; years after the show he wrote that [...] "To this day, I sense Vulcan speech patterns, Vulcan social attitudes and even Vulcan patterns of logic and emotional suppression in my behavior." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the time}} came for At the Drive-In’s next recording, Flipside quit {{producing}} records and Offtime was financially unable to, [...] "so the band literally approached almost every indie label they could think of." [...] When hope was almost lost {{and the possibility of}} another record seemed dim, Bob and Michelle Becker of Fearless Records saw At the Drive-In open for Supernova at a bar named Club Mesa. Despite Fearless’s history of producing mainly pop punk bands, the band members [...] "felt <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> Bob and Michelle on a personal level" [...] and a deal was signed. Consequently, At the Drive-In began recording its second full-length album titled In/Casino/Out on June 3, 1998. With producer and mixer Alex Newport, the band spent four days recording at Doug Messenger's, in North Hollywood, Revolver Recordings in Costa Mesa with Engineer Andy Troy for Fearless Records, and an additional two days mixing the album at Paramount, in Hollywood. This album marked a notable maturation in At the Drive-In’s sound and is special in that it was recorded live with just a small number of overdubs. In/Casino/Out was chosen to be recorded live because, according to some sources, At the Drive-In struggled to capture the intensity and emotion of its live shows in the recording studio.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I do, Mrs Pry; so pray let me {{have breakfast}} without delay, and make up my bill {{to the end of}} the week; I shall leave you then. Sorry to part, Mrs Pry. I have been <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> you." ...|$|E
50|$|Paul Weston and Jo Stafford enjoyed {{successful}} {{careers as}} musicians from the 1930s; Weston as an arranger and conductor, and Stafford as a singer. She performed {{both as a}} member of the group The Pied Pipers and as a solo artist, with many of her solo hits backed by Weston's orchestra. Stafford was <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> working <b>with</b> Weston, and the couple became romantically involved in the mid 1940s. They married in 1952, and continued to collaborate together on recordings.|$|R
60|$|So when Chatterer {{had been}} caught in the trap in Farmer Brown's corn-crib, he hadn't doubted in the least that Farmer Brown's boy would give him to Black Pussy or do {{something}} equally cruel; and even when he found that he was only to be kept a prisoner in a <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> prison, <b>with</b> plenty to eat and drink, he wasn't willing to believe any good of Farmer Brown's boy. Indeed, he hated him more than ever, if that were possible.|$|R
50|$|Western astrology {{assumes that}} each {{sign of the}} same {{triplicity}} is 120 degrees apart, forming angles to one another called trines, which are each equivalent to the 360 degrees of the circle divided by three. Trines {{are considered to be}} very powerful and yet <b>very</b> <b>comfortable,</b> free-flowing connections. This suggests that the signs in each element are <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> and compatible <b>with</b> one another and tend to have many of the same qualities in common.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tanglewood would remain," [...] {{replied the}} student, [...] "looking {{just as it}} does now, but {{occupied}} by an entirely different family.

50|$|The {{majority}} of the identified one hundred and sixteen (116) villages under this development area are all located in mountainous areas. Traveling from one village to another is difficult as there are no motorable roads but only foot paths. These people were first visited or discovered by Her Excellency Barr, Anna Dickson Darius, wife of the Executive Governor of Taraba State. Yet, the indigenous Ndola people are <b>very</b> much <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> living in the area, because they have lived here for ages.|$|R
50|$|A {{consultation}} {{exercise was}} undertaken {{with members of}} thepublic in a parallel project by Cardiff University, with specific exploration ofattitudes to the SPICE test.

6000|$|The child nodded brightly. [...] "You said {{it would}} all seem like a dream, Julian," [...] she remarked presently, as they dashed swiftly down the broad street of the Nevsky, crowded with {{vehicles}} of all kinds, from the splendidly-appointed sledges, like their own, to the lumbering vehicles of the peasants piled up with firewood.

60|$|Dick {{was sorry}} to leave his uncle, whose tent he had now shared {{for the last ten}} months. He found himself, however, <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> the Bombay troops, being made a member of the mess, {{consisting}} of the officer in command and the four officers of his staff. Wishing to have some duties with which to occupy himself, he volunteered to act as an aide-de-camp; and although the work was little more than nominal, it gave him some employment. When not otherwise engaged, he generally rode with Surajah, whom his uncle had appointed to command the twenty troopers.|$|E
60|$|But Jim's words did {{not express}} all his thoughts. If he had {{revealed}} them fully {{he would have}} described a bright fireside in a small and humble but <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> room, <b>with</b> a smiling face that rendered sunshine unnecessary, {{and a pair of}} eyes that made gaslight a paltry flame as well as an absolute extravagance. That the name of this cheap, yet dear, luminary began with an N and ended with an a, is a piece of information with which we think it unnecessary to trouble the reader.|$|R
6000|$|He'll die soon, {{and then}} she'll be comfortable! That was one phase of married life. As Crosbie's mind dwelt upon the words, he remembered Lily's promise {{made in the}} fields, that she would do {{everything}} for him. He remembered her kisses; the touch of her fingers; the low silvery laughing voice; the feel of her dress as she would press close to him. After that he reflected whether {{it would not be}} well that he too should die, so that Alexandrina might be comfortable. She and her mother might be <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> together, <b>with</b> plenty of money, at Baden-Baden! ...|$|R
60|$|So the Fairy kissed Rosalba with {{peculiar}} tenderness, {{and at once}} {{changed her}} wand into a <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> coach-and-four, <b>with</b> a steady coachman, and two respectable footmen behind, and the Fairy and Rosalba got into the coach, which Angelica and Bulbo entered after them. As for honest Bulbo, he was blubbering in the most pathetic manner, quite overcome by Rosalba's misfortune. She was touched by the honest fellow's sympathy, promised to restore to him the confiscated estates of Duke Padella his father, and created him, as he {{sat there in the}} coach, Prince, Highness, and First Grandee of the Crim Tartar Empire. The coach moved on, and, being a fairy coach, soon came up with the bridal procession.|$|R

Of course, the native officer in command of my company {{will not be able to}} show me any favour, nor should I wish him to do so. It seems like keeping one friend, while I am cut off from all others; though I dare say I shall make some new ones among the sepoys. I have no doubt you will be <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> the major." ...|$|E
60|$|A jolly Bacchus astride of his cask took Vulcan's place, and {{appeared}} to be <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> a beer-mug in one hand, a champagne bottle in the other, and a garland of grapes on his curly head. He was the text of a short temperance lecture, aimed directly at a row of smart young gentlemen who lined the walls of the auditorium. George Cole was seen to dodge behind a pillar at one point, Dolly nudged his neighbour at another, and there was laughter all along the line as the Professor glared at them through his big glasses, and dragged their bacchanalian orgies to the light and held them up to scorn.|$|E
60|$|Then Davis, {{the skip}} or attendant, led the way, keys in hand, across the quadrangle, the Major and Pen {{following}} him, the latter blushing, and {{pleased with his}} new academical habiliments, across the quadrangle to the rooms which were destined for the freshman; and which were vacated by the retreat of the gentleman-pensioner, Mr. Spicer. The rooms were <b>very</b> <b>comfortable,</b> <b>with</b> large cross beams, high wainscots, and small windows in deep embrasures. Mr. Spicer's furniture was there, and to be sold at a valuation, and Major Pendennis agreed on his nephew's behalf to take the available part of it, laughingly however declining (as, indeed, Pen did for his own part) six sporting prints, and four groups of opera-dancers with gauze draperies, which formed the late occupant's pictorial collection.|$|E
5000|$|In 1954, Frenchman Paul Magès {{developed}} a functioning air/oil hydropneumatic suspension, incorporating {{the advantages of}} earlier air suspension concepts. [...] Citroën replaced the conventional steel springs on the rear axle of their top-of-range model, the Traction Avant 15 Hydraulique. In 1955, the Citroën DS incorporated four wheel hydropneumatic suspension. This combined a <b>very</b> soft, <b>comfortable</b> suspension, <b>with</b> controlled movements, for sharp handling, together with a self-levelling suspension.|$|R
5|$|Weston {{moved from}} Capitol to Columbia Records and, in 1950, Stafford {{followed}} suit. Content and <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> working <b>with</b> him, Stafford {{had had a}} clause inserted in her contract with Capitol stating that if Weston left that label, she would automatically be released from her obligations to them. When that happened, Capitol wanted Stafford to record eight more songs before December 15, 1950, and {{she found herself in}} the unusual situation of simultaneously working for two competing record companies, an instance that was very rare in an industry where musicians were seen as assets. In 1954, Stafford became the second artist after Bing Crosby to sell 25 million records for Columbia. She was presented with a diamond-studded disc to mark the occasion.|$|R
6000|$|... '"No, I do not, fellow," [...] rejoined my uncle. [...] "Only, {{if this is}} {{a private}} room {{specially}} ordered for the occasion, I should think the public room must be a <b>VERY</b> <b>comfortable</b> one;" [...] <b>with</b> this, my uncle sat himself down in a high-backed chair, and took such an accurate measure of the gentleman, with his eyes, that Tiggin and Welps could have supplied him with printed calico for a suit, and not an inch too much or too little, from that estimate alone.|$|R
