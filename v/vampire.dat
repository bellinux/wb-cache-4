5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Interview with the <b>Vampire,</b> while living in California, Rice wrote two historical novels, The Feast of All Saints and Cry to Heaven, along with four erotic novels (The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty's Punishment, Beauty's Release, and Beauty's Kingdom) under the pseudonym A. N. Roquelaure, and two more under the pseudonym Anne Rampling (Exit to Eden and Belinda). Rice {{then returned to the}} <b>vampire</b> genre with The <b>Vampire</b> Lestat and The Queen of the Damned, her bestselling sequels to Interview with the <b>Vampire.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{where much}} of the <b>vampire</b> {{folklore}} originates, the <b>vampire</b> is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, <b>vampire</b> superstition is still rampant and sightings or claims of <b>vampire</b> attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a <b>vampire.</b> They dug up his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.|$|E

50|$|<b>Vampires</b> could summon {{and control}} certain creatures such as bats, wolves, and rats. <b>Vampires</b> could also {{transform}} themselves into bats, {{and in the}} case of some <b>Vampires,</b> wolves, while retaining their Human intelligence in these forms.

5|$|The 2010 Portuguese teen series Lua Vermelha (Red Moon) had {{a similar}} premise of <b>vampire</b> romance but {{differed}} in the story.

5|$|The charismatic and {{sophisticated}} <b>vampire</b> of modern fiction {{was born in}} 1819 {{with the publication of}} The Vampyre by John Polidori; the story was highly successful and arguably the most influential <b>vampire</b> work of the early 19th century. Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula is remembered as the quintessential <b>vampire</b> novel and provided the basis of the modern <b>vampire</b> legend. The success of this book spawned a distinctive <b>vampire</b> genre, still popular in the 21st century, with books, films, and television shows. The <b>vampire</b> has since become a dominant figure in the horror genre.|$|E
5|$|The {{legend of}} the <b>vampire</b> {{continued}} through the film industry when Dracula was reincarnated in the pertinent Hammer Horror series of films, starring Christopher Lee as the Count. The successful 1958 Dracula starring Lee was followed by seven sequels. Lee returned as Dracula in {{all but two of}} these and became well known in the role. By the 1970s, vampires in films had diversified with works such as Count Yorga, <b>Vampire</b> (1970), an African Count in 1972's Blacula, the BBC's Count Dracula featuring French actor Louis Jourdan as Dracula and Frank Finlay as Abraham Van Helsing, and a Nosferatu-like <b>vampire</b> in 1979's Salem's Lot, and a remake of Nosferatu itself, titled Nosferatu the Vampyre with Klaus Kinski the same year. Several films featured the characterisation of a female, often lesbian, <b>vampire</b> such as Hammer Horror's The <b>Vampire</b> Lovers (1970), based on Carmilla, though the plotlines still revolved around a central evil <b>vampire</b> character.|$|E

5|$|The {{three species}} of <b>vampire</b> bats are all endemic to Latin America, {{and there is}} no {{evidence}} to suggest that they had any Old World relatives within human memory. It is therefore impossible that the folkloric <b>vampire</b> represents a distorted presentation or memory of the <b>vampire</b> bat. The bats were named after the folkloric <b>vampire</b> rather than vice versa; the Oxford English Dictionary records their folkloric use in English from 1734 and the zoological not until 1774. The <b>vampire</b> bat's bite is usually not harmful to a person, but the bat has been known to actively feed on humans and large prey such as cattle and often leaves the trademark, two-prong bite mark on its victim's skin.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vampire</b> bat lineage diverged {{from its}} family 26 million years ago. The hairy-legged <b>vampire</b> bat likely diverged {{from the other}} two species of <b>vampire</b> bats 21.7 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vampire</b> is now {{a fixture}} in popular fiction. Such fiction began with 18th-century poetry and {{continued}} with 19th-century short stories, {{the first and most}} influential of which was John Polidori's The Vampyre (1819), featuring the <b>vampire</b> Lord Ruthven. Lord Ruthven's exploits were further explored in a series of <b>vampire</b> plays in which he was the antihero. The <b>vampire</b> theme continued in penny dreadful serial publications such as Varney the <b>Vampire</b> (1847) and culminated in the pre-eminent <b>vampire</b> novel in history: Dracula by Bram Stoker, published in 1897.|$|E

5|$|<b>Vampire</b> bats are bats whose {{food source}} is blood, a dietary trait called hematophagy. Three bat species feed solely on blood: the common <b>vampire</b> bat (Desmodus rotundus), the hairy-legged <b>vampire</b> bat (Diphylla ecaudata), and the white-winged <b>vampire</b> bat (Diaemus youngi). All three species are {{native to the}} Americas, ranging from Mexico to Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Argentina.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vampire</b> bats hunt {{only when}} it is fully dark. Like fruit-eating bats, and unlike insectivorous and {{fish-eating}} bats, they emit only low-energy sound pulses. The common <b>vampire</b> bat feeds mostly on the blood of mammals (occasionally including humans), whereas both the hairy-legged <b>vampire</b> bat and white-winged <b>vampire</b> bat feed on the blood of birds. Once the common <b>vampire</b> bat locates a host, such as a sleeping mammal, it lands and approaches it on the ground. It then likely uses thermoception to identify a warm spot on the skin to bite. They then create a small incision with their teeth and lap up blood from the wound.|$|E
5|$|Vampiric {{entities}} {{have been}} recorded in most cultures; the term <b>vampire,</b> previously an arcane subject, was popularised in the West in the early 19th century, after an influx of <b>vampire</b> superstition into Western Europe from areas where <b>vampire</b> legends were frequent, such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe; local variants were also known by different names, such as shtriga in Albania, vrykolakas in Greece and strigoi in Romania. This increased level of <b>vampire</b> superstition in Europe led to mass hysteria {{and in some cases}} resulted in corpses being staked and people being accused of vampirism.|$|E
5000|$|Some <b>vampires</b> have {{an aversion}} to crucifixes, holy water and the like, but Newman portrays this a superstition; <b>vampires</b> without such [...] "silly ideas" [...] show no ill effects from {{religious}} symbols. Garlic, too, is only effective against <b>vampires</b> who believe their own folklore. However, silver is deadly to all of Newman's <b>vampires.</b>|$|R
5000|$|High-blood <b>vampires</b> are <b>vampires</b> {{who were}} born already {{infected}} by the virus, which has influenced their development in the womb. They have increased strength and speed, more so than low-blood <b>vampires,</b> {{but not as much}} as the undead; they do however have some abilities that the other kinds don't: living high-blood <b>vampires</b> are empathic and can [...] "pull an aura" [...] to influence, intimidate, or control others. They have sharper and slightly longer canine teeth than humans or low-blood <b>vampires.</b> They also have a greater craving for blood than low-blood <b>vampires,</b> but it is not essential to their existence. When high-blood <b>vampires</b> die, no matter the cause, they rise again as undead the next sundown. Their appearance as undead is more like traditional literary <b>vampires</b> such as Bram Stoker's Dracula, so they then have longer fangs and paler skin.|$|R

5|$|A few species, {{specifically}} the common, white-winged, and hairy-legged <b>vampire</b> bats, exclusively consume animal blood (hematophagy). The common <b>vampire</b> bat typically feeds on large mammals such as cattle, while the hairy-legged and white-winged vampires feed on birds instead. <b>Vampire</b> bats target sleeping prey and can detect deep breathing. Heat sensors {{in the nose}} help them to detect blood vessels near {{the surface of the}} skin. They pierce the animal's skin with their teeth, biting away a small flap, and lap up the blood with their tongues, which have lateral grooves adapted to this purpose. The blood is kept from clotting by an anticoagulant in the saliva.|$|E
