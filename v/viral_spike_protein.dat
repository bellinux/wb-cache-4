The upregulation of CCL 2 by SARS-CoV spike protein was mainly mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK 1 / 2) and AP- 1 but not the IκBα-NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, Ras and Raf upstream of the ERK 1 / 2 signaling pathway were involved in the upregulation of CCL 2. Furthermore, ACE 2 receptor was activated by casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation in cells pretreated with the virus-like particles containing spike protein.

Our objective was to study amiodarone uptake, clarify the origin of vacuoles, and investigate the effect of amiodarone on {{the life cycle of}} the coronavirus responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which, to enter cells, relies on the proteolytic cleavage of a <b>viral</b> <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> by the endosomal proteinase cathepsin L. Using alveolar macrophages, we studied uptake of (125) I-amiodarone and (125) I-B 2, an analog lacking the lateral group diethylamino-beta-ethoxy, and analyzed the effects of amiodarone on the distribution of endosomal markers and on the uptake of an acidotropic dye. Furthermore, using Vero cells, we tested the impact of amiodarone on the in vitro spreading of the SARS coronavirus. We found that (1) amiodarone associates with different cell membranes and accumulates in acidic organelles; (2) the diethylamino-beta-ethoxy group is an important determinant of uptake; (3) vacuoles forming upon exposure to amiodarone are enlarged late endosomes; (4) amiodarone inhibits the spreading in vitro of SARS coronavirus; and (5) trypsin cleavage of the <b>viral</b> <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> before infection, which permits virus entry through the plasma membrane, does not impair amiodarone antiviral activity.

Then, newly synthesized vRNAs are nuclear-exported to the cytoplasm as ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs), followed by transport to the beneath plasma membrane where virus particles assemble.

We have developed a quantitative biochemical assay to monitor the budding of Semliki Forest virus (SFV), an enveloped alphavirus that buds from the plasma membrane in a reaction requiring both <b>viral</b> <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> and nucleocapsid. The assay was based on cell surface biotinylation of newly synthesized virus <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> and retrieval of biotinylated virions using streptavidin-conjugated magnetic particles. Budding of biotin-tagged SFV was continuous for at least 2 h, independent of microfilaments and microtubules, strongly temperature dependent, and relatively independent of continued exocytic transport. Studies of cell surface <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> at early times of infection showed that these spikes did not efficiently bud into virus particles and were rapidly degraded. In contrast, at later times of infection, <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> degradation was markedly reduced and efficient budding was then observed.

Advancements in mass-spectrometry (MS) now allow one to quantify the fatty acids linked to single acylation sites. We report that G of Vesicular Stomatitis virus contains palmitate at a cytoplasmic cysteine, whereas F of Newcastle Disease virus and E 1 of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) are stoichiometrically acylated with stearate at a transmembrane cysteine. E 2 of SFV contains three molecules of palmitate and one molecule of stearate, the latter probably attached to a transmembrane cysteine.

However, the evolutionary pathway of MERS-CoV is still unclear. A receptor binding domain (RBD) in the MERS-CoV envelope-embedded spike protein specifically engages human CD 26 (hCD 26) to initiate viral entry. The high sequence identity in the <b>viral</b> <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> prompted us to investigate if HKU 4 and HKU 5 can recognize hCD 26 for cell entry. We found that HKU 4 -RBD, but not HKU 5 -RBD, binds to hCD 26, and pseudotyped viruses embedding HKU 4 spike can infect cells via hCD 26 recognition. The structure of the HKU 4 -RBD/hCD 26 complex revealed a hCD 26 -binding mode similar overall to that observed for MERS-RBD.

This thesis investigates the cellular entry of FIPV {{in order to}} discover targets which may be of therapeutic value in treating this disease. This thesis demonstrates that FIPV utilizes the lectin DC-SIGN to enhance cellular uptake. This is significant because macrophages and dendritic cells, which express DC-SIGN at high levels, are infected by FIPV to initiate the disease process. This thesis also shows that FIPV activates the p 38 MAPK signaling pathway in infected cells, and that this induces the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in cats with FIP.

HAT cleaved SARS-S at R 667, as determined by mutagenesis and mass spectrometry, and activated SARS-S for cell-cell fusion in cis and trans, while the related pulmonary protease TMPRSS 2 cleaved SARS-S at multiple sites and activated SARS-S only in trans. However, TMPRSS 2 but not HAT expression rendered SARS-S-driven virus-cell fusion independent of cathepsin activity, indicating that HAT and TMPRSS 2 activate SARS-S differentially.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that only the viral glycoproteins were associated with all the complexes formed. The level of sodium cholate remaining after dialysis was shown to be reduced to less than 1 molecule per 80 protein molecules. Viral proteins reconstituted into dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes were shown to have retained hemagglutination, low-pH-dependent hemolysis, and neuraminidase activities and were associated with a lipid bilayer in two types of complexes with average lipid to protein mole ratios after sucrose density gradient purification of either 590 : 1 or 970 : 1. The bilayer vesicles formed were of similar sizes and were shown by negative-stain electron microscopy to be 150 - 300 nm in diameter with well-defined spikes on their surface. Reconstituted liposomes of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine {{were found to be}} unstable with respect to their trapped volume and therefore were unsuitable for fusion studies, unlike complexes formed with phosphatidylcholine or a mixture of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine derived from hen eggs.

40|$|The budding and {{the fusion}} {{processes}} of the enveloped animal virus Semliki Forest virus serve the purpose of transporting its nucleocapsid, containing its genome, from the cytoplasm of an infected cell into that of an uninfected one. We show here that, in the infected cell, the <b>viral</b> membrane (<b>spike)</b> <b>proteins</b> p 62 and E 1 are organized as heterodimers which are very resistant to dissociation in acidic conditions. In contrast, the mature form of the heterodimer, E 2 E 1, which {{is found in the}} virus particle and which is generated by proteolytic processing of p 62, is very prone to dissociate upon treatment with mildly acidic buffers. We discuss the possibility that this difference in behavior of the intracellular precursor form and the mature form of the <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> complex represents an important regulatory mechanism for the processes involving membrane binding around the nucleocapsid during budding and membrane release from the nucleocapsid at the stage of virus fusion...|$|R

Mellman, Nature (London) 336 : 36 - 42, 1988) {{recently}} reported {{the production of}} network antibodies that were suggested to have reconstructed a specific interaction between the nucleocapsid of Semliki Forest virus and the cytoplasmic tail of the <b>viral</b> E 2 <b>spike</b> <b>protein.</b> The F 13 anti-idiotype antibody, which was raised against anti-E 2 tail antibodies, was claimed to recognize the virus nucleocapsid. In this report, we have used recombinant SFV viruses {{to demonstrate that the}} F 13 antibody is not nucleocapsid specific but instead most likely recognizes some component of the viral replication machinery...|$|R
