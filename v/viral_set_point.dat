This is a cohort study of patients with laboratory evidence of PHI. Independent predictors of early HAART and the <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. Plasma HIV- 1 RNA (pVL) and CD 4 trajectories were analyzed using linear mixed models. A total of 332 patients were included in the analysis. Sixty-four patients started HAART within 180 days of seroconversion. A higher baseline pVL was independently predictive of the start of early HAART (OR: 2. 69 /log 10 pVL, p = 0. 001). Thirty-two patients who interrupted early HAART were compared with 250 patients who remained untreated for more than 180 days after seroconversion. Temporary early HAART was not significantly associated with a longer AIDS-free survival but did result in an initial, but transient lowering of the <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> The <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> was initially 0. 6 log copies/ml lower after interruption of early HAART (p < 0. 001) and remained lower during 83 weeks of follow-up.

Previous studies have hypothesized that the effective CD 8 (+) T-cell responses are those driving the selection of escape mutations that reduce viral fitness and therefore revert post-transmission. In this study, we adopted a novel approach to define better the role of reverting escape mutations in immune control of HIV infection. This analysis of sequences from 710 study subjects with chronic C-clade HIV type 1 infection demonstrates the importance of mutations that impose a fitness cost in the control of viremia.

Therefore, despite the inevitable evolution of viral escape, viremia can be controlled through the selection of mutations that are detrimental to viral fitness.

We compared CD 4 lymphocyte cell count levels at seroconversion, decline rates and <b>viral</b> load <b>set</b> <b>point</b> in individuals infected with different HIV- 1 subtypes. METHODS We used {{data from the}} Concerted Action on SeroConversion to AIDS and Death in Europe (CASCADE) collaboration, restricted to those infected since 1996, aged ≥ 15 years, and applied mixed effects models for CD 4 cell count decline and median regression for <b>viral</b> load <b>set</b> <b>point</b> (mean level 6 - 24 months from seroconversion). RESULTS The analysis included 3364 seroconverters with known HIV- 1 subtypes. Compared with subtype B, CD 4 at seroconversion was significantly higher for subtype CRF 01 and lower for subtype C. Subsequent CD 4 decline was significantly slower for subtypes A and CRF 02 and marginally slower for subtype C compared with B. Mean CD 4 loss at 2 years of seroconversion for white men exposed through sex between men, aged 30 - 39 years, having seroconverted since 2006, enrolled within 6 months of seroconversion, and without acute infection was 88, 142, 100, 130, 103, and 167 cells/µL for subtypes A, B, C, CRF 01 _AE, CRF 02 _AG, and G, respectively.

In macaques, proinflammatory cytokine production in the genital tract is necessary for target cell recruitment and establishment of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection following vaginal inoculation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess if genital inflammation during early HIV- 1 infection predisposes women to rapid disease progression. Methods. Inflammatory cytokine concentrations were measured in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) from 49 women 6, 17, 30, and 55 weeks after HIV- 1 infection and from 22 of these women before infection. Associations between genital inflammation and <b>viral</b> load <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and blood CD 4 cell counts 12 months after infection were investigated. Results. Elevated genital cytokine concentrations 6 and 17 weeks after HIV- 1 infection were associated with higher <b>viral</b> load <b>set</b> <b>points</b> and, to a lesser extent, with CD 4 depletion. CVL cytokine concentrations during early infection did not differ relative to preinfection but were elevated in women who had vaginal discharge, detectable HIV- 1 RNA in their genital tracts, and lower blood CD 4 counts. Conclusion. Genital inflammation during early HIV- 1 infection was associated with higher <b>viral</b> load <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and CD 4 depletion, which are markers of rapid disease progression.

Gamma interferon (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay responses across the complete proteome were measured in 47 subtype C HIV- 1 -infected participants at a median of 12 weeks postinfection. When corrected for amino acid length and individuals responding to each region, the order of recognition was as follows: Nef > Gag > Pol > Rev > Vpr > Env > Vpu > Vif > Tat. Nef responses were significantly (P < 0. 05) dominant, targeted six epitopic regions, and were unrelated to the course of viremia.

Using transgenic mice in which Tregs can be selectively ablated, we now show that transient depletion of Tregs during a chronic retroviral infection allows exhausted CD 8 (+) T cells to regain antiviral functions, including secretion of cytokines, production of cytotoxic molecules, and virus-specific cytolytic activity. Furthermore, short-term Treg ablation resulted in long-term reductions in chronic virus loads.

In order to study the impact of alcohol on HIV infection, we developed a model of chronic alcohol consumption in rhesus macaques monkeys (Macaca mulatta) infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a lentivirus closely related to HIV that infects and destroys CD 4 + cells and produces a progressive immunodeficiency representative of HIV disease. Using this model, our studies have shown that plasma viral loads are significantly higher in alcohol-consuming macaques at 60 – 120 days after SIV infection (<b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>point)</b> than in control animals. The <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> {{has been shown to be}} predictive of disease progression, and in our studies, alcohol consumption was associated with accelerated disease progression to end-stage disease. The rhesus macaque SIV model should be useful in identifying the mechanisms by which alcohol increases the viral load of HIV, affects HIV-associated comorbidities, and influences the efficacy of anti-retroviral therapy...|$|E
40|$|Exceedingly high viral {{loads and}} rapid loss of CD 4 + T cells in all tissue {{compartments}} are {{a hallmark of}} acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection, which is often accompanied by clinical symptoms such as fever, maculopapular rash, and/or lymphadenopathy. The resolution of the clinical symptoms and the subsequent decrease in plasma viremia {{are associated with the}} emergence of HIV- 1 –specific CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses. The remarkable early inhibition of viremia by CD 8 + T cells appears to be precipitated by {{only a limited number of}} specific CD 8 + T cell responses, and the plasma viremia is reduced to a “set point” level. Over time, the breadth and magnitude of CD 8 + T cell responses increase, but without a change in the control of viral replication or further reduction in the <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> Moreover, the early <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> consequent on the first CD 8 + T cell responses, is highly predictive of the later course of disease progression. Thus, HIV- 1 –specific CD 8 + T cell responses in acute HIV- 1 infection appear uniquely able to efficiently suppress viral replication, whereas CD 8 + T cell responses generated in the chronic phase of infection appear often impaired.

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the benefit of temporary combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) during primary HIV infection (PHI). Methods and Findings: Adult patients with laboratory evidence of PHI were recruited in 13 HIV treatment centers in the Netherlands and randomly assigned to receive no treatment or 24 or 60 wk of cART (allocation in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio); if therapy was clinically indicated, participants were randomized over the two treatment arms (allocation in a 1 : 1 ratio). Primary end points were (1) <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> defined as the plasma viral load 36 wk after randomization in the no treatment arm and 36 wk after treatment interruption in the treatment arms, and (2) the total time that patients were off therapy, defined as the time between randomization and start of cART in the no treatment arm, and the time between treatment interruption and restart of cART in the treatment arms. cART was (re) started in case of confirmed CD 4 cell count < 350 cells/mm 3 or symptomatic HIV disease. In total, 173 participants were randomized. The modified intention-to-treat analysis comprised 168 patients: 115 were randomized over the three study arms, and 53 randomized over the two treatment arms. Of the 115 patients randomized over the three study arms, mean <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> was 4. 8 (standard deviation 0. 6) log 10 copies/ml in the no treatment arm, and 4. 0 (1. 0) and 4. 3 (0. 9) log 10 copies/ml in the 24 - and 60 -wk treatment arms (between groups: p< 0. 001). The median total time off therapy in the no treatment arm was 0. 7 (95 % CI 0. 0 - 1. 8) y compared to 3. 0 (1. 9 - 4. 2) and 1. 8 (0. 5 - 3. 0) y in the 24 - and 60 -wk treatment arms (log rank test, p< 0. 001). In the adjusted Cox analysis, both 24 wk (hazard ratio 0. 42 [95 % CI 0. 25 - 0. 73]) and 60 wk of early treatment (hazard ratio 0. 55 [0. 32 - 0. 95]) were associated with time to (re) start of cART.

40|$|Numerous {{anomalies}} in B-cell phenotypes {{and functions}} {{have been described}} in HIV-infected individuals. However, the actual relationship between B cells and disease progression remains unclear. In this study, we investigated B-cell counts/percentages during a 12 -month infection period in HIV-infected individuals that eventually developed into typical progressors (TPs) or rapid progressors (RPs). We found, after 12 months of infection, the baseline B-cell counts/percentages correlated positively with CD 4 + T-cell counts (P= 0. 0006 and P= 0. 026) and negatively with HIV <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>points</b> (P= 0. 014 and P= 0. 002). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that high baseline B-cell counts/percentages were associated with a slow CD 4 -cell decline. B-cell kinetics indicated the baseline B-cell counts/percentages could be factors distinguishing between TPs and RPs. The combination of the baseline B-cell counts and percentages was associated with rapid disease progression (a 80. 7 % predictive value {{as measured by the}} area under the curve).

40|$|The {{potential}} of immunotherapy with autologous virus-specific T cells {{to affect the}} course of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection was explored {{in a group of}} specific-pathogen-free cats infected with FIV a minimum of 10 months earlier. Popliteal lymph node cells were stimulated by cocultivation with UV-inactivated autologous fibroblasts infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing either FIV gag or env gene products, followed by expansion in interleukin- 2. One or two infusions of both Gag- and Env-stimulated cells resulted in a slow increase in FIV-specific gamma interferon-secreting T cells in the circulation of cats. In the same animals, <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>points</b> fluctuated widely during the first 2 to 3 weeks after adoptive transfer and then returned to pretreatment levels. The preexisting viral quasispecies was also found to be modulated, whereas no novel viral variants were detected. Circulating CD 4 (+) counts underwent a dramatic decline early after treatment. CD 4 /CD 8 ratios remained instead essentially unchanged and eventually improved in some animals.

These animals along with six control macaques were infected intravenously with mixture of simian-human immunodeficiency virus KU- 1 B (SHIVKU- 1 B), SHIV 89. 6 P, and simian immunodeficiency virus 17 E-Fr. Levels of circulating CD 4 + T cells and viral loads in the plasma and the cerebrospinal fluid were monitored in these macaques for a period of 12 weeks. Both morphine and control groups showed precipitous loss of CD 4 + T cells. However this loss was more prominent in the morphine group at week 2 (P = 0. 04). Again both morphine and control groups showed comparable peak plasma viral load at week 2, but the <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>points</b> were higher in the morphine group than that in the control group. Likewise, the extent of virus replication in the cerebral compartment was more pronounced in the morphine group.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} causing AIDS {{and subsequently}} death in {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 infection are not yet fully understood. Nonetheless, correlates of accelerated progression to disease based on immunological and virological markers have been identified. The best correlate identified to date is the baseline virus load or the so-called <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> By focusing on a virus load measurement from a restricted time range, however, we ignore valuable information contained in the long-term profile of the virus load. Here, we investigate the relationship between virus load and survival {{with the aid of}} a statistical model. The model takes into consideration the virus load at every stage of the disease. In particular, we aim to determine the effect of peaks of virus load on disease progression. We fit our model to unique sequential viral load data of 12 simian immunodeficiency virus mac 251 -infected rhesus macaques which contain frequent measurements throughout the entire course of the infection until the development of simian AIDS. Our model enables us to predict the survival times of the animals more accurately than an equivalent model which considers the <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> only. Furthermore, we find that peaks of the virus load contribute less to disease progression than phases of low virus load with the same amount of viral turnover. Our analysis implies that the total viral turnover is not the best correlate of survival. As a consequence, the direct cytopathic effects of virus replication may, by themselves, have less of an impact on disease progression than previously thought...|$|E
40|$|Regulatory T cells {{contain a}} mix of CD 4 and CD 8 T cell subsets that can {{suppress}} immune activation {{and at the same}} time suppress immune responses, thereby contributing to disease progression. Recent studies have shown that an increased prevalence of CD 8 +FoxP 3 + T regulatory cells was associated with immune suppression and diminished viral control in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) -infected rhesus macaques. Preventing an increase in the prevalence of CD 8 T regulatory subsets is likely to lead to a better long-term outcome. Here we show that short-term antiretroviral therapy initiated within 1 week after SIV infection was associated with lower <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and immune activation after withdrawal of therapy as compared to untreated animals. Early short-term treated controller animals were found to have better SIV-specific immune responses and a significantly lower prevalence of immunosuppressive CD 8 +FoxP 3 + T cells. Lower levels of CD 8 +FoxP 3 + T cells coincided with preservation of CD 4 +FoxP 3 + T cells at homeostatic levels, and significantly correlated with lower immune activation, suggesting a role for viral infection-driven immune activation in the expansion of CD 8 +FoxP 3 + T cells. Interestingly, initiation of continuous therapy later in infection did not reduce the increased prevalence of CD 8 +FoxP 3 + T cells to homeostatic levels. Taken together, our results suggest that early antiretroviral therapy preserves the integrity of the immune system leading to a lower <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> in controller animals, and prevents alterations in the homeostatic balance between CD 4 + and CD 8 + T regulatory cells that could aid in better long-term outcome...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether a}} 28 -day course of potent antiretroviral therapy, initiated {{at a time}} point (48 h postinoculation) following simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) inoculation when the acquisition of a viral infection was virtually assured, would sufficiently sensitize {{the immune system and}} result in controlled virus replication when treatment was stopped. The administration of tenofovir 48 h after SIV inoculation to six Mamu-A* 01 -negative rhesus macaques did, in fact, potently suppress virus replication in all of the treated rhesus macaques, but plasma viral RNA rapidly became detectable in all six animals following its cessation. Unexpectedly, the <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>points</b> in the treated monkeys became established at two distinct levels. Three controller macaques had chronic phase virus loads in the range of 1 × 103 RNA copies/ml, whereas three noncontroller animals had <b>set</b> <b>points</b> of 2 × 105 to 8 × 105 RNA copies/ml. All of the noncontroller monkeys died with symptoms of immunodeficiency by week 60 postinfection, whereas two of the three controller animals were alive at week 80.

Virological, immunological, and body composition measurements were taken every 4 weeks for 120 weeks. RESULTS: There {{was no difference between}} groups in weight gain, body mass index (BMI), crown-heel length, waist circumference, total tissue mass, lean mass, bone mineral content, or bone mineral density. The rhesus macaques on the supplemented diet had a higher death rate (hazard ratio, 2. 39; P 3 ̆c. 001) than those on the nonsupplemented diet; death in both groups was associated with a higher <b>viral</b> load <b>set</b> <b>point</b> during the early phase of infection.

40|$|Most HIV- 1 {{infections are}} thought to occur at mucosal {{surfaces}} during sexual contact. It has been hypothesized that vaccines delivered at mucosal surfaces may mediate better protection against HIV- 1 than vaccines that are delivered systemically. To test this, rhesus macaques were vaccinated by intramuscular (i. m.) or intravaginal (ivag.) routes with helper-dependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vectors expressing HIV- 1 envelope. Macaques were first immunized intranasally with species C Ad serotype 5 (Ad 5) prior to serotype-switching with species C HD-Ad 6, Ad 1, Ad 5, and Ad 2 vectors expressing env followed by rectal challenge with CCR 5 -tropic SHIV-SF 162 P 3. Vaccination by the systemic route generated stronger systemic CD 8 T cell responses in PBMC, but weaker mucosal responses. Conversely, mucosal immunization generated stronger CD 4 T cell central memory (Tcm) responses in the colon. Intramuscular immunization generated higher levels of env-binding antibodies, but neither produced neutralizing or cytotoxic antibodies. After mucosal SHIV challenge, both groups controlled SHIV better than control animals. However, more animals in the ivag. group had lower <b>viral</b> <b>set</b> <b>points</b> than in in the i. m. group.
