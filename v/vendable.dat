I The Scituation, and plenty of the Province. II The Laws, Customs, and natural Demeanor of the Inhabitant. III The worst and best Usage of a Mary-Land Servant, opened in view. IV The Traffique and <b>vendable</b> Commodities of the Countrey. Also a small Treatise on the wilde and naked Indians (or Susquehanokes) of Mary-Land, their Customs, Manners, Absurdities, & Religion. Together with a Collection of Historical Letters.(London, 1666).After an obscure two-year apprenticeship he left London in 1658 due to a hatred for its local Puritans, according to his own account. Alsop worked as an indentured servant for two years. His master, Thomas Stockett (1635-1671), was one of four brothers who immigrated from England in 1658 and settled in Baltimore County, Maryland. [...] George Alsop appreciated the new colony, but at the end of his service to Thomas Stockett, he grew ill and returned to England. He then published his book, and may also have written a volume of Sermons, a work presented later by someone of the same name. In the work on Maryland, Alsop asserts that his design is to encourage European and English emigration to America. Alsop's eagerness to praise every aspect of Maryland makes his work a permanent record of the psychology of advertising. It also serves to a lesser extent as a reliable historical source of information for early Baltimore County, Maryland, and the then native Susquehannock.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to outline the {{feasibility}} of potential helmet rental systems that could work in the city of Philadelphia. Recommendations were made through examination of existing literature, bike share programs around the world, and meetings conducted with Thomas Jefferson University and Philadelphia City officials. Three recommendations are concluded from all the research. A traditional helmet rental system like the systems used in Seattle and Boston is one option. Free bicycle helmets for seasonal pass holders is recommended to address the users most at risk. However, the best option and recommendation is to use EcoHelmet and their innovative <b>vendable</b> and recyclable helmet alleviating most of the users concerns while ensuring head safety. In addition, an educational program to emphasize the benefits of helmet use is encouraged in combination with any of the three recommendations. Overall, helmets must become a part of the bike share to increase the safety of the riders and EcoHelmet is an innovative solution. Presentation: 14 : 5...|$|E
