5|$|Despite the big-ticket {{performances}} and media stunts, the inaugural festival cost $2.4million, {{and there was}} poor community interest, with just 8600 visitors. The first Enlighten did however attract 2400 <b>visitors</b> <b>from</b> interstate or overseas who came to Canberra specifically for Enlighten or extended their stay because of it.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the campus, {{numerous}} fountains provide {{white noise}} as a background. The initial design has remained intact; however benches and fences have been installed around the plaza fountains to discourage <b>visitors</b> <b>from</b> wading into the pools.

5|$|A {{pilgrimage to}} the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey was held by a few local churches in 1924. Pilgrimages {{continue}} today to be held; {{in the second half}} of June for the Anglicans and early in July for the Catholics and they attract <b>visitors</b> <b>from</b> all over Western Europe. Services are celebrated in the Anglican, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions. The abbey site is visited by over 100,000 a year.|$|E
5|$|Broader {{tensions}} in American society surfaced in Yosemite {{when a large}} number of youths gathered in the park over the summer of 1970, triggering a riot on July4 after rangers tried to evict <b>visitors</b> <b>from</b> camping illegally in Stoneman Meadow. Rioters attacked the rangers with rocks, and pulled mounted rangers from their horses. The National Guard was brought in to restore order.|$|E

5|$|Henri Christophe first {{appears at}} the {{beginning}} of Part Two. He is described as a black master chef who has just bought the lodgings at the Auberge de la Couronne from Mademoiselle Monjean. His dishes are famous for the perfection of their seasoning and/or for the abundance of ingredients that allow for <b>visitors</b> <b>from</b> across the world to be satisfied. He is said to have a magic touch with turtle vol-au-vent or wood pigeons.|$|E
5|$|In winter, the {{resident}} bird population is increased by <b>visitors</b> <b>from</b> north-east Europe, {{in particular the}} widgeon and Greenland white-fronted goose. Riverside mammals are seen frequently and otters, mink and fox are common. Trout and salmon are less common in the Shannon than they once were, however pike is still plentiful and attracts many anglers.|$|E

5|$|Literature {{academic}} Jayne Ashleigh Glover {{says that}} while Zone Three on the surface {{appears to be a}} feminist utopia, Lessing shows that it is far from idyllic. The story narrators, the Chroniclers of Zone Three, question their zone's behaviour and attitudes, and warn of the dangers of stagnation. Al•Ith, upon returning to Zone Three, is shunned by its inhabitants for failing to attend to their zone's needs, and Zone Three's stasis manifests itself in xenophobia when Al•Ith brings back new perspectives, followed by <b>visitors</b> <b>from</b> Zone Four.|$|E
5|$|Monaco's history predates the Roman {{occupation}} of AD122. Its large natural harbour ensured {{a steady stream}} of <b>visitors</b> <b>from</b> Byblos, Tyre, and Sidon. Later the Phoenicians came to trade silk, oil, and spices with the natives. It was the Phoenicians who introduced to this area of the Mediterranean their god Melkart, later known by the Romans as Hercules Monoikos. It was after this god that the Romans renamed the area Portus Hercules Moneici, which has evolved to the present name of Monaco.|$|E
5|$|Other local sports clubs include cricket, hockey, rugby, {{lacrosse}} and golf. Among Eastbourne's {{golf courses}} are the Royal Eastbourne, Eastbourne Downs, Willingdon and the Eastbourne Golfing Park.

Eastbourne Sovereign Sailing Club, on the seafront towards the eastern end, organises dinghy sailing for its members and <b>visitors</b> <b>from</b> Easter to Boxing Day and usually holds a National Championship Series for a popular UK class in the summer months.|$|E

5|$|Quyllur Rit'i also attracts <b>visitors</b> <b>from</b> {{outside the}} Paucartambo and Quispicanchis moieties. Since the 1970s, an {{increasing}} number of middle-class mainstream Peruvians undertake the pilgrimage, some of them at a different date than more traditional pilgrims. There has also been a rapid {{growth in the number of}} North American and European tourists drawn to the indigenous festival, prompting fears that it is becoming too commercialized. The pilgrimage and associated festival were inscribed in 2011 on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.|$|E
5|$|The towers are semi-circular. Their inner flanks have lobed arches as decorations, a North African motif {{introduced}} to Egypt by the Fatimids. The vestibule {{to the right}} contains a half-domed recess with elegantly carved arches at each corner. The gates were massive, weighing four tons. The gates today have two minarets, open to <b>visitors,</b> <b>from</b> which the area may be viewed. Additions were made during the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Tottenham, {{also of the}} Premier League, {{began by}} facing Nottingham Forest at White Hart Lane. After a goalless first half, Jorge Grant gave the <b>visitors</b> <b>from</b> the Championship {{the lead in the}} 65th minute.

5|$|Atangana {{won over}} other chiefs and headmen through gifts, tax cuts, flattery, and {{intervention}} on their behalf. He lavished attention on <b>visitors</b> <b>from</b> out of town, letting them stay at his palace and use his horses, and treating them to feasts. In addition to flattering them, this {{allowed him to}} monitor their activities and dealings with the colonial authorities. His clerk appointees in Jaunde informed him of the doings of both the Germans and his subjects. Atangana gained {{a substantial amount of}} wealth. He owned workshops and sold produce from five plantations to provision impressed railway construction workers.|$|E
5|$|In 1838, a {{man named}} Mr. Butler {{requested}} permission of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to construct a tunnel or through cut through Nescopeck Mountain for the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Glen Summit Springs Hotel operated on top of Nescopeck Mountain. It was constructed by the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company. During its most active use, it attracted <b>visitors</b> <b>from</b> the Wyoming Valley and from the East Coast of the United States. The Lehigh Valley Railroad historically passed over the ridge. In the late 1800s, the ridge was prospected for coal.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority {{announced}} plans to renovate the train station. This, along the village's plans to revitalize the entire village of Sloatsburg, was thought to give the bland train station a more traditional look. This would include adding a roof to protect commuters and <b>visitors</b> <b>from</b> the elements, such as rain or snow, handicap-accessible ramps for wheelchairs, better lighting, more seats for people to wait, and a heated shelter. (A shelter exists, but is not heated). The village also wants to use a $50,000 grant from the state to construct a large municipal parking lot near the station. This would get more people to use the station, as because {{with the lack of}} facilities, the station is under-used. The preliminary design was made by Jeff Livingston, an architect on the Sloatsburg Revitalization Committee.|$|E
