40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new {{design of a}} hat-fed reflector antenna for satellite communication, where low sidelobe and cross polar levels are required over a wideband. The hat feed has been optimized in the design by using the genetic algorithm (GA) through a commercial FDTD solver QuickWave V 2 D together with own developed Matlab code. The Gaussian <b>vertex</b> <b>plate</b> has been applied at {{the centre of the}} reflector for improving the reflection coefficient of the whole hat-fed reflector antenna. A return loss of 15 dB is obtained over a bandwidth of 47. 5 %. The simulations have been verified by measurements; both of them are presented in the paper...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} a new hat feed {{that is made}} entirely of metal without using dielectric material. Compared to previous hat feeds where a piece of dielectric is used to support the hat on the waveguide, the new feed has lower manufacturing cost and higher reliability. In addition, the new hat feed has low radiation along the feeding waveguide, which makes the <b>vertex</b> <b>plate</b> unnecessary. Therefore the bandwidth over which the reflection coefficient magnitude is below - 15 dB has increased. The feed has been optimised using a genetic algorithm. A prototype has been manufactured, and measured results are presented to verify the numerical simulations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{two aspects of}} {{research}} interest: moment method analysis of antennas on cylindrical structures by using G 2 DMULT, and design of hat fed reflector antennas. Both of them are two-dimensional (2 D) structure problems, one being cylindrical and the other rotationally symmetric. Many antennas consist of three-dimensional (3 D) elements, such as dipoles, slots or patches, {{in the vicinity of}} 2 D structures, such as cylinders of arbitrary cross section or rotationally symmetric bodies. When dealing with these electromagnetic problems, it is very efficient to find the radiation characteristics of the 3 D elements and the mutual couplings between them by using a spectrum of 2 D solutions (S 2 DS). We refer to the 3 D elements as excitation elements, as they determine the spectral variation of the solutions. G 2 DMULT is a general algorithm based on the S 2 DS technique. The associated FORTRAN program G 2 DMULT calculates the spectral Green's functions of 2 D MULTiregion structures by using the method of moment (MoM). In this thesis the implementation and applications of G 2 DMULT for cylindrical multiregion structures are presented. The spectral electric and magnetic field integral equations (EFIE and MFIE) and their moment method solution formulations are derived. In order to speed up the convergence and increase the accuracy, three pulse-approximated triangular basis and test functions are implemented in G 2 DMULT. The boundary conditions at different material interfaces are treated carefully. The self-impedance and the radiation efficiency of a dipole near a lossy dielectric cylinder with arbitrary cross section are calculated and verified against measurements. As applications of G 2 DMULT, base station antennas such as Allgon's Metro-III antenna have been analyzed. Several other application cases, including the scattering from dielectric coated cylinders, are also simulated and compared with simulations and measurements done by others. The other type of 2 D structures - the rotationally symmetric structures, also referred to as bodies of revolution (BOR) - has not yet been implemented in G 2 DMULT. Therefore, a commercial code called V 2 D based on the FDTD method was chosen as an analysis tool. The hat-fed reflector antenna is a BOR structure consisting of a rotationally symmetric and almost-parabolic reflector and a waveguide-fed rear-radiating feed, referred to as the hat feed. This thesis presents the procedure of designing hat-fed reflector antennas. This was applied in two industrial projects, to design millimeter wave radio link antennas for Ericsson Microwave System AB (EMW) and a level gauging antenna for Saab Marine Electronics AB (SME). In such designs it is important to locate the feed correctly relative to the reflector. The location is determined by the phase center of the feed, which for the hat feed is ring shaped. Therefore, we derived a formula to calculate the location of the ring-shaped phase center of feeds which radiate around a support tube such as the hat feed. The aperture efficiency can be improved up to 0. 5 dB by using this formula. Primary-fed reflectors of these types are often provided with a <b>vertex</b> <b>plate</b> to reduce the return loss of the feed. In order to reduce the effect of the <b>vertex</b> <b>plate</b> on the far-out sidelobes, a new type of <b>vertex</b> <b>plate</b> with Gaussian thickness profile is introduced and the formula to determine the dimensions of this <b>vertex</b> <b>plate</b> is derived. A new version of the hat feed, the Chinese hat feed, is also presented in this thesis. The Chinese hat feed provides an opportunity to control the beamwidth of the radiation pattern that makes it suitable for use in a shallow reflector. A hybrid method, which combines the MoM program G 1 DMULT with the V 2 D code, is used to analyze the increased sidelobes due to scattering from screw heads in reflector antennas. Several ways to reduce this scattering are presented...|$|E
50|$|The {{eyes are}} usually very obvious, but reach a {{remarkable}} {{development in the}} Brachycera. In this suborder the eyes are markedly convex and have grown to occupy most {{of the side of}} the head. The space between the two eyes can sometimes be reduced to a narrow strip running {{from the front of the}} occipital region, or disappear altogether because of the direct contact between the eyes or their margins. The morphology of the compound eye is characterized by a significant number of ommatidia, of the order of thousands in Muscoids. The ocelli, when present, are located in the top of the head, arranged at the corners of a triangle in an area called stemmaticum or ocellar triangle. For the purpose of systematics the presence, the arrangement and the conformation of the cephalic bristles is important and they have a specific terminology. Bristles on the head are: frontal bristles sometimes named lower orbital bristles are located on the frontal plates of the frons resembling a small alley extending from the base of the antennae toward the vertex and edging the median frontal stripe laterally. Sometimes they are situated lower, along the frontalia below the antennal attachment and over a greater or lesser distance. Orbital bristles are located on the <b>vertex</b> <b>plates</b> of the frons and usually restricted to its upper half. They may be arranged in longitudinal rows named inner and outerorbital bristles. (The frontal and <b>vertex</b> <b>plates</b> of the frons can be visualised on the basis of the arrangement of the frontal and orbital bristles); ocellar bristles are located on the vertex between the ocelli; outer and inner vertical bristles are located on the border between the vertex and the occiput and near the upper corner of the eyes; postvertical bristles are located behind the ocelli on the occiput near the median line of the head; vibrissae usually arrayed in small numbers along the facial sections of the arcuate suture, near the margin of the oral cavity; sometimes they ascend along the suture over a greater or lesser distance, occasionally almost to the place of antenna1 attachment; false vibrissae-bristles are placed along the margin of the oral cavity.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{design of the}} hat-fed {{reflector}} antenna for satellite communications, where a low reflection coefficient, high gain, low sidelobes and low cross-polar level are required over a wide frequency band. The hat feed has been optimized by using the Genetic Algorithm through a commercial FDTD solver, QuickWave-V 2 D, together with an own developed optimization code. The Gaussian <b>vertex</b> <b>plate</b> has been applied {{at the center of}} the reflector in order to improve the reflection coefficient and reduce the far-out sidelobes. A parabolic reflector with a ring-shaped focus has been designed for obtaining nearly 100 % phase efficiency. The antenna's reflection coefficient is below - 17 dB and the radiation patterns satisfy the M-x standard co- and cross-polar sidelobe envelopes for satellite ground stations over a bandwidth of 30 %. A low-cost monolayer radome has been designed for the antenna with satisfactory performance. The simulations have been verified by measurements; both of them are presented in the paper...|$|E
