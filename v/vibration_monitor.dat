40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of proper {{instrumentations}} and the difficulties in underwater measurements, the studies about water bottom vibration induced by underwater drilling blasting are seldom reported. In order to investigate the propagation and attenuation laws of blasting induced water bottom vibration, a water bottom <b>vibration</b> <b>monitor</b> was developed with consideration of the difficulties in underwater measurements. By means of this equipment, the actual water bottom vibration induced by underwater drilling blasting was measured in a field experiment. It shows that the water bottom <b>vibration</b> <b>monitor</b> could collect vibration signals quite effectively in underwater environments. The followed signal analysis shows that the characteristics of water bottom vibration and land ground vibration induced by the same underwater drilling blasting are quite different due to the different geological environments. The amplitude and frequency band of water bottom vibration both exceed those of land ground vibration. Water bottom vibration is mainly in low-frequency band that induced by blasting impact directly acts on rock. Besides the low-frequency component, land vibration contains another higher frequency band component that induced by followed water hammer wave acts on bank slope...|$|E

40|$|Limited {{research}} has been conducted on inconsistencies relating to whole-body vibration (WBV) field assessments. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate a certain possible contributor to inconsistencies in vibration assessment work, namely averaging intervals. To our knowledge, this was the first study investigating the effect of multiple averaging approaches on WBV results. WBV parameters were measured for a driver operating a vehicle on a preselected test route utilising ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997. This was achieved utilizing a Quest HavPro <b>vibration</b> <b>monitor</b> with a fitted tri-axial Integrated Circuit Piezoelectric (ICP) accelerometer pad mounted on the driver’s seat. Furthermore, in an attempt to decrease differences between observed WBV results, an outlier detection method, part of the STATA software package was utilised to clean the data. Statistical analyses included hypothesis testing in the form of one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks to determine significant differences between integration intervals. Logged data time-series durations showed a W 0 = 0. 04, therefore indicating unequal variance. Omission of 60 s from statistical analyses showed a W 0 = 0. 28. The observed difference occurs when data is averaged over longer intervals, resulting in portions of data not being reflected in the final dataset. In addition, frequency-weighted root mean squared acceleration results reflected significant differences between 1 s, 10 s, 30 s, 60 s and SLOW averaging approaches, while non-significant differences were observed for crest factors and instantaneous peak accelerations. Vibration Dose Value results reflected non-significant differences after omission of 60 second averaging interval data. Cleaned data showed significant differences between various averaging approaches as well as significant differences when compared with raw vibration data. The study therefore outlined certain inconsistencies pertaining to the selection of multiple integration intervals during the assessment of WBV exposure. Data filtering could not provide a conclusion on a suitable averaging period and as such, further research is required to determine the correct averaging interval to be used for WBV assessment.

Peculiarity of the method is use of new monitoring and diagnostics algorithms based on dimensionless ratings (S-discriminants) of amplitudely clipped vibrations. Formulas for its calculation are given. These S-discriminants being adapted to specific machine are noise-immuned, provided a threshold of clipping is chosen in a proper way, and very sensitive to machine degradation process it begins only. Besides, if we turn from wide frequency band to the definite narrow frequency bands, we get valuable diagnostic information about specific units of the machine.
