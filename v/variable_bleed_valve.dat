In order to solve this problem, this paper develops a model-based FHA method for <b>Variable</b> <b>Bleed</b> <b>Valve</b> (VBV) position control function, performs two groups of simulations by using aero-engine dynamic model, and introduces an exemplary FHA for VBV position control function based upon simulation results.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{application}} of the baseline Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm to the control of main fuel flow rate (WF 36), <b>variable</b> <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> (AE 24) and variable stator vane (STP 25) control of a simulated high-bypass turbofan engine. Using reference trajectories for thrust and turbine inlet temperature (T 41) generated by a simulated new engine, we have examined MPC for tracking these two reference outputs while controlling a deteriorated engine. We have examined the results of MPC control for six different transients: two idle-to-takeoff transients at sea level static (SLS) conditions, one takeoff-to-idle transient at SLS, a Bode power command and reverse Bode power command at 20, 000 ft/Mach 0. 5, and a reverse Bode transient at 35, 000 ft/Mach 0. 84. For all cases, our primary focus was on the computational effort required by MPC for varying MPC update rates, control horizons, and prediction horizons. We have also considered the effects of these MPC parameters on the performance of the control, with special emphasis on the thrust tracking error, the peak T 41, and the sizes of violations of the constraints on the problem, primarily the booster stall margin limit, which for most cases is the lone constraint that is violated with any frequency...|$|E
40|$|This Master Thesis was {{accomplished}} {{during the period}} 20 th August 2007 to 18 th of January 2008 at Volvo Aero Corporation. The Master Thesis was the final moment in the MSc programme in Mechanical Engineering at Lule√• University of Technology. During {{the development of a}} new aero engine family a new <b>Variable</b> <b>Bleed</b> <b>Valve</b> system (VBV-system) was designed, the second phase of this design was to reduce the weight of the components by considering alternative materials and methods of manufacture: thus improving Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC). Several concepts were discussed with regards to the VBV- system and one of these was to replace some of the existing metallic (Aluminum & Titanium) components with a composite alternative and the unison ring was considered to be a prime candidate for this study. The challenge in using composites is the complexity of the material. Different mechanical properties and performance can be achieved by different numbers of layers, fiber orientations and choice of fiber and matrix. In order to use composites, a full understanding of the mechanical behavior of the unison ring is required. This resulted in a review study of the existing unison ring. The most important task was to investigate how changes in the unison ring stiffness could affect the opening and closing of the 10 VBV doors, located in the Fan Hub Frame. With the results given in the review study, a concept generation (including basic laminate theory) was made to determine the final concept design. From the concept generation, it was determined that the unison ring should be designed as a sandwich, with composite laminates on top and bottom. Between the two composite laminates foam or honeycomb should be used. The composite material was chosen to be a standard aerospace composite, which are based on long fiber reinforcements (carbon) with epoxy matrix. Most of the fibers are orientated along the unison ring, to keep both tensile stiffness (AE) and bending stiffness along the unison ring as high as possible. To ensure that the composite laminate was fiber dominated, at least 10 % of the fibers and a maximum of 60 % of the fibers were oriented in four different directions. The research performed in this study has been a limited concept study, therefore more studies are needed before a final design can be achieved. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|Active {{control of}} {{rotating}} stall and surge using <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> {{has been demonstrated}} on low and high speed compressors using high bandwidth actuators. In this paper we provide a method to reduce the bandwidth and rate requirements for control of rotating stall by combining an axisymmetric <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> with continuous air injection. The addition of the continuous air injection is modeled as a shift of both the stable and unstable parts of the compressor characteristic and serves to reduce the requirement of a <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> used for rotating stall stabilization purpose. The results are demonstrated using a lowspeed, single stage, axial flow compressor. 1. Introduction Rotating stall and surge {{are two types of}} instabilities that occur in the axial flow compressor part of a gas-turbine engine. Rotating stall is a flow separation that travels around the annulus of the compressor (referred to as a stall cell) while surge is a large axial oscillation of the flow.

50|$|The air {{pressure}} system on a tire changer provides {{the air to}} inflate tires mounted on wheels. The {{air pressure}} system consists of 4 components: air hose, air inflation gauge, inflation pedal and manual pressure <b>bleed</b> <b>valve.</b> The air hose is located {{near the top of}} the tire changer, and it allows compressed air to travel into the tire. A specialized end is used on the air hose to clamp firmly onto valve stems of the wheels. The air inflation gauge displays the air pressure within the tire when the air hose is connected to the valve stem. The air inflation gauge displays the pressure in pounds per square inch (psi). Directly below the air hose on the side of the tire changer is the inflation pedal that enables the inflation of the tire. When the inflation pedal is raised, a burst of air is released from valves next to each rim clamp toward the bottom bead of the tire to help with inflation. The manual <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> is located next to the air hose and air inflation gauge. The manual <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> allows the manual release of air pressure from tire.|$|R

This detection is shown through progressive changes, particularly in the high-frequency content, as a function of exposure to greater cumulative quantities of ash. Additionally, detection of the simulated failure of the 14 th stage stability <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> and, to a lesser extent, the station 2. 5 stability <b>bleed</b> <b>valve,</b> to their fully-open fail-safe positions was achieved by means of spectral comparisons between nominal (normal valve operation) and seeded fault scenarios...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} the actuator rate requirements {{for control of}} rotating stall using a <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> and provide tools for predicting these requirements.
