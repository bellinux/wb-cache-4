25|$|In general relativity, {{something}} somewhat analogous happens, {{but there}} it is the Ricci tensor which vanishes in any <b>vacuum</b> <b>region</b> (but not in a region which is matter-free but contains an electromagnetic field), and it is the Weyl curvature which is generated (via another first order covariant differential equation) by variations in the stress–energy tensor and which then propagates into vacuum regions, rendering gravitation a long-range force capable of propagating through a vacuum.|$|E

2500|$|Be this as it may, {{very few}} {{examples}} of exact solutions modeling isolated and rotating objects in general relativity are presently known. [...] In fact, the list of useful solutions presently consists of the Neugebauer-Meinel dust (which models a rigidly rotating thin (finite radius) disk of dust surrounded by an asymptotically flat <b>vacuum</b> <b>region)</b> and a few variants. [...] In particular, there is no known perfect fluid source which can be matched to a Kerr vacuum exterior, {{as one would expect}} in order to create the simplest possible model of a rotating star. [...] This is surprising because of the plenitude of fluid interiors which match to Schwarzschild vacuum exteriors.|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, if {{some argue}} that an {{interior}} solution which matches to the Kerr vacuum, which has Petrov type D, should also be type D. [...] There {{is in fact a}} known perfect fluid solution, the Wahlquist fluid, which is Petrov type D and which has a definite surface across which one can attempt to match to a vacuum exterior. [...] However, {{it turns out that the}} Wahlquist fluid cannot be matched to any asymptotically flat <b>vacuum</b> <b>region.</b> [...] In particular, contrary to naive expectation, it cannot be matched to a Kerr vacuum exterior. [...] A tiny minority of physicists (actually, a minority of one) appear to believe that general relativity is unacceptable because it does not allow sufficiently general asymptotically flat solutions (evidently this argument implicitly assumes that we have decisively rejected at least some Machian principles!), but a sequence of increasingly sophisticated and general existence results appears to contradict this assumption.|$|E

40|$|In {{a hybrid}} plasma solver (particle ions, fluid mass-less electrons) <b>regions</b> of <b>vacuum,</b> or very low charge density, can cause {{problems}} since {{the evaluation of}} the electric field involves division by charge density. This causes large electric fields in low density regions that can lead to numerical instabilities. Here we propose a self consistent handling of <b>vacuum</b> <b>regions</b> for hybrid solvers. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>regions</b> can be considered having infinite resistivity, and in this limit Faraday's law approaches a magnetic diffusion equation. We describe an algorithm that solves such a diffusion equation in regions with charge density below a threshold value. We also present an implementation of this algorithm in a hybrid plasma solver, and an application to the interaction between the Moon and the solar wind. We also discuss the implementation of hyperresistivity for smoothing the electric field in a PIC solver. Comment: Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of ASTRONUM- 201...|$|R

2500|$|The {{development}} of the APCI interface for LC-MS started with Horning and collaborators in the early 1973. However, its commercial application was introduced {{at the beginning of}} the 1990s after Henion and collaborators improved the LC-APCI-MS interface in 1986. The APCI ion source/ interface can be used to analyze small, neutral, relatively non-polar, and thermally stable molecules (e.g., steroids, lipids, and fat soluble vitamins). These compounds are not well ionized using ESI. In addition, APCI can also handle mobile phase streams containing [...] buffering agents. The liquid from the LC system is pumped through a capillary and there is also nebulization at the tip, where a corona discharge takes place. First, the ionizing gas surrounding the interface and the mobile phase solvent are subject to chemical ionization at the ion source. Later, these ions react with the analyte and transfer their charge. The sample ions then pass through small orifice skimmers by means of or ion-focusing lenses. Once inside the high <b>vacuum</b> <b>region,</b> the ions are subject to mass analysis. This interface can be operated in positive and negative charge modes and singly-charged ions are mainly produced. APCI ion source can also handle flow rates between [...] 500 and 2000 μl/min and it can be directly connected to conventional 4.6nbsp&mm ID columns.|$|E

50|$|The vacuum {{is created}} and {{maintained}} {{by a series}} of pumps. The first stage is usually based on a roughing pump, most commonly a standard rotary vane pump.

40|$|Abstract. The {{values for}} the {{gravitational}} energy-momentum density, given by the famous classical pseudotensors: Einstein, Papapetrou, Landau-Lifshitz, Bergmann-Thompson, Goldberg, Møller, and Weinberg, in the small region limit are found to lowest non-vanishing order in normal coordinates. All except Møller’s have the zeroth order material limit required by the equivalence principle. However for small <b>vacuum</b> <b>regions</b> we find {{that none of these}} classical holonomic pseudotensors satisfies the criterion of being proportional to the Bel-Robinson tensor. Generalizing an earlier work which had identified one case, we found another independent linear combination satisfying this requirement—and hence a one parameter set of linear combinations of the classical pseudotensors with this desirable property...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study global {{existence}} of weak {{solutions for the}} Quantum Hydrodynamics System in 2 -D {{in the space of}} energy.
