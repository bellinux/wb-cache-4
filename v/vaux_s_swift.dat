30|$|To perform further {{analysis}} of the data collected there are several factors that need to be considered. Firstly it is already noted {{that there has been a}} change in the types of materials used in vehicles over the 40 -year span of experiments assessed in this work. These changes in materials have been notably in the plastics and composite content which have increased up to 181.4  kg (400 lbs) per vehicle in 2010 s compared to less than 9.1  kg (20 lbs) per vehicle in the 1960 <b>s</b> (<b>Swift</b> 2012). These changes could result in differences in the fire severity characteristics of a vehicle even if the weight is the same due to changing amount and calorific value of the combustible materials. In addition it is also noted that the procedures, standards and/or protocols varied between each experiment which likely lead to different effects on the fire spread, availability of air etc. Finally it is important to note that the various heat release rate measurement techniques, namely mass loss rate, convective calorimetry and species-based calorimetry, could result in variability in the heat release rate measurements (Biteau et al. 2008) thus affecting the fire severity analyses.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{observations of}} GRB 050422, a Swift-discovered gamma-ray burst. The prompt gamma-ray emission had a T 90 duration of 59 s and was multipeaked, {{with the main}} peak occurring at T+ 53 <b>s.</b> <b>Swift</b> was able to follow the X-ray afterglow within 100 s of the burst trigger. The X-ray light curve, which shows a steep early decline, can be described by a broken power law with an initial decay slope of α 1 ∼ 5. 0, a break time tb∼ 270 s and a post-break decay slope of α 2 ∼ 0. 9, when the zero time of the X-ray emission is taken to be the burst trigger time. However, if the zero time is shifted {{to coincide with the}} onset of main peak in the gamma-ray light curve then the initial decay slope is shallower with α 1 ∼ 3. 2. The initial gamma-ray spectrum can be modelled by a power law with a spectral index of βB= 0. 50 ± 0. 19. However, the early time X-ray spectrum is significantly steeper than this and requires a spectral index of βX= 2. 33 + 0. 58 − 0. 55. In comparison with other Swift bursts, GRB 050422 was unusually X-ray faint, had a soft X-ray spectrum, and had an unusually steep early X-ray decline. Even so, its behaviour can be accommodated by standard models. The combined BAT/XRT light curve indicates that the initial, steeply declining, X-ray emission is related to the tail of the prompt gamma-ray emission. The shallower decay seen after the break is consistent with the standard afterglow model. Peer-reviewedPublisher Version 4335...|$|R

40|$|Boss & Vanhala (2000, 2001) {{prepared}} {{reviews of}} triggered collapse and injection models, using Prudence Foster's finite differences code {{at very high}} spatial resolution (440 x 1440 cells) to demonstrate the convergence of the R-T fingers in triggered injection models. A two dimensional hydrodynamical calculation with unprecedentedly high spatial resolution (960 x 2880 zones, or almost 3 million grid points) demonstrated that it suitable shock front can both trigger the collapse of an otherwise stable presolar cloud, and inject shock front particles into the collapsing cloud through the formation of what become Rayleigh-Taylor fingers of compressed fluid layers falling into the gravitational potential well of the growing protostar. These calculations suggest that heterogeneity derived from these R-T fingers will persist down to the scale of their injection {{onto the surface of}} the solar nebula. Haghighipour developed a numerical code capable of calculating the orbital evolution of dust grains of varied sizes in a gaseous nebula, subject to Epstein and Stokes drag as well as the self-gravity of the disk. In collaboration with the PI and George W. Wetherill, Haghighipour has been involved in development of a new idea on the possibility of rapid formation of ice giant planets via the disk instability mechanism. Haghighipour studied the stability of a five-body system consisting of the Sun and four protoplanets by numerically integrating their equations of motions. Using Levison and Duncan <b>s</b> <b>SWIFT</b> integrator, Haghighipour showed that, depending on the orbital parameters of the bodies, such a system can be stable for 0. 1 - 10 Myr. Time periods of 1 Myr or more are long enough to be consistent with the time scale proposed for the formation of giant planets by the disk instability mechanism and the photoevaporation of the gaseous envelopes of the outermost protoplanets by a nearby OB star, resulting in the formation of ice giant planets. The PI has used his three dimensional models of marginally gravitationally unstable disks to study the preservation of isotopic heterogeneity in evolving protoplanetary disks. Such heterogeneity might arise from the infall onto the disk s surface of solids processed in the X-wind region of the disk, or derived from stellar nucleosynthesis and injected by R-T fingers. The technique used consists of solving a color equation, identical to the gas continuity equation, which follows the time evolution in three space dimensions of an arbitrarily placed initial color field, i. e., a dye inserted the disk. The models show that significant concentrations of color could persist for time periods of about a thousand years or more, even in the most dynamically active region of such a disk. Such a time period might be long enough for solids to coagulate and grow to significant sizes while retaining the isotopic signature of their birth region in the nebula...|$|R

The final version is available from Oxford University Press via [URL] significant portion of Matthew Arnold’s cultural and intellectual thinking derived from a phrase by Jonathan Swift: $sweetness~and~light$.

In his discussion of Liberal politics, Francis Newman and Homeric poetry, and the parochialism of the English middle class, Arnold restaged the battle between urbanity and philology which Swift and the Tory wits fought in response to Richard Bentley. This essay juxtaposes and interweaves these debates to show that articulacy twice attempted to lay total claim to knowledge; on each occasion, the effort to protect literature and ambiguity spurred Swift and Arnold to discrete imaginative acts engendered by the same anxiety over minute scholarship. It is suggested this disquiet was especially acute because the techniques of satire and artistry made those forms appear less disinterested and more pedantic than they professed to be, whilst Bentley’s philological work was truly exemplary of the vital creativity Swift and Arnold espoused. At work was a double irony: Swift and Arnold encouraged a ranging and cursory approach whilst in fact employing the subtlest stylistic manoeuvres to attenuate the rise of a discipline which was in reality concerned with the aesthetic as well as the historical...|$|R

Journal of Glaciology, 57 (204), 710 - 720. Dispersed facies basal ice - massive (i. e. structureless) ice with dispersed debris aggregates - is present {{at the margins of}} many glaciers and, as a product of internal glacial processes, has the potential to provide important information about the mechanisms of glacier flow {{and the nature of the}} subglacial environment. The origin of dispersed facies is poorly understood, with several hypotheses having been advanced for its formation, and there is disagreement as to whether it is largely a sedimentary or a tectonic feature. We test these established hypotheses at the temperate glacier Svinafellsjokull, Iceland, and find that none fully account for dispersed facies characteristics at this location. Instead, dispersed facies physical, sedimentological and stable-isotope (delta(18) O, delta D) characteristics favour a predominantly tectonic origin that we suggest comprises the regelation and strain-induced metamorphism of debris-rich basal ice that has been entrained into an englacial position by tectonic processes operating at the base of an icefall. Further thickening of the resultant dispersed facies may also occur tectonically as a result of ice flow against the reverse bed slope of a terminal overdeepening. Lack of efficient subglacial drainage in the region of the overdeepening may limit basal melting and thus favour basal ice preservation, including the preservation of dispersed facies. Despite the relatively low sediment content of dispersed facies (similar to 1. 6 % by volume), its thickness (up to 25 m) and ubiquity at Svinafellsjokull results in a significant contribution to annual sediment discharge (1635 - 3270 m(3) a(- 1)) that is similar to 6. 5 times that contributed by debris-rich stratified facies basal icePeer reviewe...|$|R

We find that, in our model, a monoenergetic injection of electrons at γ_ 0 = 910 into the model region, which are accelerated by Fermi-I- and Fermi-II-processes while suffering synchrotron and inverse Compton losses, finally leads to the observed SED of PKS 2155 - 30. 4 shown in H. E. S. S. and Fermi-LAT collaborations (2009). In contrast to other SSC models our parameters arise from the jet's microphysics and the spectrum is evolving selfconsistently from diffusion and acceleration. The γ_ 0 -factor {{can be interpreted as}} two counterstreaming plasmas due to the motion of the blob at a bulk factor of Γ = 58 and opposed moving upstream electrons at moderate Lorentz factors with an average of γ_u ≈ 8.

40|$|In 2006 March {{the soft}} gamma-ray {{repeater}} SGR 1900 + 14 resumed its bursting activity after ~ 2 yr of quiescence. The Swift mission observed the source several times. We {{report on the}} intense burst ``forest'' recorded on March 29, which lasted for ~ 30 <b>s,</b> when <b>Swift</b> was pointing at the source with the narrow field of view instruments. More than 40 bursts were detected by BAT and XRT, 7 of which were rare intermediate flares (IFs). The BAT data were used to carry out time-resolved spectroscopy in the 14 - 100 keV range down to 8 ms timescales. BAT and XRT simultaneous data were used to characterize the broadband energy spectra of IFs and verify the results obtained from the BAT-only spectral fits. This unique data set allowed us to test the magnetar model predictions, such as the magnetically trapped fireball and twisted magnetosphere, over an unprecedented range of fluxes and with large statistics. We confirmed that a two-blackbody component adequately fits the time-resolved and integrated spectra of IFs. However, Comptonization models give comparably good reduced χ 2. Moreover, we found a change of behavior, around ~ 1041 erg s- 1, above which the softer blackbody shows a sort of saturation, while the harder one still grows to a few times 1041 erg s- 1, and a rather sharp correlation between temperature and radii of the blackbodies (R 2 ~kT- 3), which holds for the most luminous parts of the flares (~Ltot>= 1041 erg s- 1). Within the magnetar model, {{the majority of these}} findings are accounted for in terms of thermalized emission from the E-mode and O-mode photospheres. Interestingly, the maximum observed luminosity coming from a region of ~ 15 km matches the magnetic Eddington luminosity at the same radius, for a surface dipole field of ~ 8 × 1014 G (virtually equal to that deduced from the spin-down of SGR 1900 + 14) ...|$|R
40|$|Between 1786 and 1835, Philadelphia {{played host to}} {{a revolutionary}} {{transformation}} in the methods and intentions of criminal punishment. Beginning with a shift away from sanguinary and public corporal punishments, and culminating in the opening of Eastern State Penitentiary, this transformation was spearheaded {{by the members of}} the Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons. These wealthy and influential Philadelphians joined together in 1787 to advocate for penitential punishment; to incorporate the goal of reforming offenders into the state's penal code. In the antebellum period, the Society's advocacy coalesced under the leadership of Roberts Vaux, a Quaker philanthropist and archetype of the era's gentlemen reformers. In the 1820 <b>s,</b> <b>Vaux</b> articulated the Separate System of prison discipline, in which inmates would remain in constant solitary confinement while laboring in their cells. Crucially, and in opposition to the contemporary Silent System originating in New York, Vaux insisted upon a complete lack of corporal punishment in the Separate System. This thesis analyzes Vaux's development of the Separate System in conjunction with his contemporary anti-slavery theory to shed greater light on the reasoning behind his aversion to corporal punishment. Although he certainly did find corporal punishment barbaric and inhumane, his opposition to its use in the Separate System stemmed more from its position in the economy of power inherent to Southern slavery. In his observations of slavery, Vaux saw how bodily coercion, especially when used to extract labor from unwilling subjects, failed to access man's most productive motivations and engendered feelings of anger and resentment. By examining the effect of Vaux's anti-slavery on the creation of the Separate System, we can better understand both how he hoped it would function and the kind of reformation he hoped it would achieve...|$|R
