They are constructed from epithelium, but they have a few muscle fibres in them, namely the <b>vocalis</b> <b>muscle</b> which tightens the front part of the ligament near to the thyroid cartilage.

25|$|Human VF are paired {{structures}} {{located in}} the larynx, just above the trachea, which vibrate and are brought in contact during phonation. The human VF are roughly 12 – 24mm in length, and 3–5mm thick. Histologically, the human VF are a laminated structure composed of five different layers. The <b>vocalis</b> <b>muscle,</b> {{main body of the}} VF, is covered by the mucosa, which consists of the epithelium and the lamina propria. The latter is a pliable layer of connective tissue subdivided into three layers: the superficial layer (SLP), the intermediate layer (ILP), and the deep layer (DLP). Layer distinction is either made looking at differential in cell content or extracellular matrix (ECM) content. The most common way being to look at the ECM content. The SLP has fewer elastic and collagenous fibers than the two other layers, and thus is looser and more pliable. The ILP is mostly composed of elastic fibers, while the DLP has fewer elastic fibers, and more collagenous fibers. In those two layers, which form {{what is known as the}} vocalis ligament, the elastic and collagenous fibers are densely packed as bundles that run almost parallel to the edge of the vocal fold.|$|E

By 2 months of age, the vocal fold started differentiating into a bilaminar structure of distinct cellular concentration, with the superficial layer being less densely populated than the deeper layer. By 11 months, a three-layered structure starts to be noted in some specimens, again with different cellular population densities. The superficial layer is still hypocellular, followed by an intermediate more hypercellular layer, and a deeper hypercellular layer, just above the <b>vocalis</b> <b>muscle.</b> Even though the VF seem to start organizing, this is not representative of the trilaminar structure seen in adult tissues, where the layer are defined by their differential elastin and collagen fiber compositions. By 7 years of age, all specimens show a three-layered vocal fold structure, based on cellular population densities. At this point, the superficial layer was still hypocellular, the middle layer was the hypercellualr one, with also a greater content of elastin and collagen fibers, and the deeper layer was less cellularly populated. Again, the distinction seen between the layers at this stage is not comparable to that seen in the adult tissue. The maturation of the VF did not appear before 13 years of age, where the layers could be defined by their differential fiber composition rather than by their differential cellular population. The pattern now show a hypocellular superficial layer, followed by a middle layer composed predominantly of elastin fiber, and a deeper layer composed predominantly of collagen fibers. This pattern can be seen in older specimens up to 17 years of age, and above. While this study offers a nice way to see the evolution from immature to mature VF, it still does not explain what is the mechanism behind it.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to compare differential sensitivity of different muscles to succinylcholine in a swine model, and to realize the influence of NMBAs on neuromonitoring. Six male Duroc-Landrace piglets were anesthetized with thiamylal and underwent tracheal intubation without the use of an NMBA. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve, the spinal accessory nerve, the right phrenic nerve and the brachial plexus were stimulated. Evoked potentials (electromyography signal) of four muscle groups were elicited from needle electrodes before and after intravenous succinylcholine bolus (1. 0 mg/kg). Recorded <b>muscles</b> included the <b>vocalis</b> <b>muscles,</b> trapezius muscle, diaphragm and triceps brachii muscles. The onset time and 80 % recovery of control response were recorded and analyzed. The testing was repeated after 30 minutes.

While the SLP is rather poor in elastic and collagenous fibers, the ILP and DLP are mostly composed of it, with the concentration of elastic fibers decreasing and the concentration of collagenous fibers increasing as the <b>vocalis</b> <b>muscle</b> is approached. Fibrous proteins and interstitial molecules play different roles within the ECM. While collagen (mostly type I) provides strength and structural support to the tissue, which are useful to withstanding stress and resisting deformation when subjected to a force, elastin fibers bring elasticity to the tissue, allowing it to return to its original shape after deformation. Interstitial proteins, such as HA, plays important biological and mechanical roles in the VF tissue. In the VF tissue, HA plays a role of shear-thinner, affecting the tissue viscosity, space-filler, shock absorber, as well as wound healing and cell migration promoter.

Unilateral vocal fold paralysis model was induced by {{destruction of the}} left recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) in anesthetized dogs. With a micro controller-based electronic system, electromyography (EMG) signals from cricothyroid (CT) muscle on the ipsilateral side were recorded and used to trigger pacing of paralyzed <b>vocalis</b> <b>muscles.</b> The dynamic movement of vocal folds was continuously monitored using an endoscope, and the opening and closing of the glottis were quantified with customized imaging processing software. Results. The recorded video images showed that left side vocal fold was obviously paralyzed after destructing the RLN. Using the pacing system with feedback triggering EMG signals from the ipsilateral CT muscle, the paralyzed vocal fold was successfully reactivated, and its movement was shown to be synchronized with the healthy side. Significance. The developed unilateral laryngeal pacing system triggered by EMG from the ipsilateral side CT muscle could be successfully used in unilateral vocal fold paralysis with the advantage of avoiding disturbance to the healthy side muscles...|$|R

This study aimed {{to investigate and}} compare the recovery profiles of succinylcholine and rocuronium on the laryngeal muscle during IONM of the RLN in a porcine model. Nine male Duroc-Landrace piglets were anesthetized with thiamylal and underwent tracheal intubation without neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs). Needle electrodes were inserted into the <b>vocalis</b> <b>muscles</b> through the cricothyroid ligament. The RLN was exposed and stimulated. Electromyographic (EMG) signals were obtained {{before and after the}} intravenous administration of a NMBA. The EMG amplitudes were measured before and after (at 1 -minute intervals) the administration of the study drug until complete recovery. The study NMBA regimen included succinylcholine (1  mg/kg), low-dose rocuronium (0. 3  mg/kg), and standard dose rocuronium (0. 6  mg/kg). The maximal neuromuscular blockade and 80 % recovery (i. e., duration) of the control responses were recorded and analyzed. The 80 % recovery of the control response for succinylcholine (1  mg/kg) was 19. 7  ±  1. 5 minutes; low-dose rocuronium (0. 3  mg/kg), 16. 3  ±  2. 5 minutes; and standard dose rocuronium (0. 6  mg/kg), 29. 3  ±  5. 7 minutes. Succinylcholine (1  mg/kg) and low-dose rocuronium (0. 3  mg/kg) had significantly shorter durations than standard dose rocuronium (0. 6  mg/kg). The EMG signal recovery returned to baseline within 30 minutes in the succinylcholine and low-dose rocuronium groups, but it did not return to baseline until 1 hour after surgery in the rocuronium (0. 6  mg/kg) group. In this study, succinylcholine (1  mg/kg) and low-dose rocuronium (0. 3  mg/kg) had favorable recovery profiles on the laryngeal muscle. It is recommended that low-dose rocuronium may replace succinylcholine for the induction of general anesthesia during IONM of the RLN in thyroid surgery...|$|R
40|$|Symposium: Minimally Invasive Techniques In Thyroid Surgery And Intra Operative Nerve MonitoringThe {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerve (RLN) {{is at risk}} {{of injury}} in multiple operations in the skull base, neck and thoracic regions. Nerve monitoring has been employed for more than 3 decades, aiming to aid the surgeon to identify the RLN and {{reduce the risk of}} RLN injury. Conventional nerve monitoring requires identification and active intermittent stimulation of the RLN. Between intervals of stimulation, nerve injuries can still occur without the surgeon recognizing it. A new system of continuous intraoperative nerve monitoring (CIONM) works through automatic periodic stimulation (APS) of the vagus nerve has been developed. The new system employs an electrode that is attached to the vagus nerve {{at the start of the}} operation. Patient will be intubated with an endotracheal tube with contact electrodes on the vocal cords for monitoring the EMG of the <b>vocalis</b> <b>muscles</b> similar to conventional RLN monitoring. The nerve monitor will provide periodic stimulation of the vagus nerve and the integrity of the RLN can be assessed by the amplitude of the latency of EMG. Reduction in the amplitude and increase in latency signal imminent RLN injury. The system is designed for thyroid operations but we have adopted the system for minimally invasive oesophagectomy. Initial experience with 10 patients, the time required for placement of the vagus nerve electrode averaged 35 min (24 - 80 min). There were two adverse events. In one event, there was more than 50 % reduction of EMG amplitude that persisted but the patient had no vocal cord paralysis after operation. In another patient the EMG reduced by 75 % and persisted. The patient had temporary vocal cord paralysis recovered 6 weeks after operation. CIONM may reduce the incidence of RLN injury by alerting the surgeon imminent nerve injury...|$|R

5000|$|The modal voice, or modal {{register}}, and falsetto register differ {{primarily in}} {{the action of the}} vocal cords. Production of the normal voice involves vibration of the entire vocal cord, with the glottis opening first at the bottom and then at the top. Production of falsetto, on the other hand, vibrates only the ligamentous edges of the vocal folds while leaving each fold's body relatively relaxed. Transition from modal voice to falsetto occurs when each vocal cord's main body, or <b>vocalis</b> <b>muscle,</b> relaxes, enabling the cricothyroid muscles to stretch the vocal ligaments.

The intermediate layer of the lamina propria tends to atrophy only in men. The deep layer of the lamina propria of the male vocal fold thickens because of increased collagen deposits. The <b>vocalis</b> <b>muscle</b> atrophies in both men and women.

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} collect electromyographic signals from the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the larynx, {{as well as from}} the orbicularis oris superior, during the production of three classes of voiceless stop consonants: unaspirated, aspirated, and glottalized. Two phoneticians, both nonnative speakers of ejectives, produced the three classes of stops. The unaspirated stops are characterized by simultaneous voice onset, while the aspirated and glottalized stops both have long voicing lags. ^ The results of an analysis of two of the experiments are reported. The aim of the analysis was to isolate (1) patterns of muscle activity which are common to all three classes of homorganic stops, and (2) patterns which distinguish the three classes from each other. The orbicularis oris muscle shows greater activity for labial ejectives (glottalized stops) than for the other two classes. Acceptable recordings were obtained from three intrinsic laryngeal muscles, the interarytenoid, lateral cricoarytenoid, and <b>vocalis</b> <b>muscles.</b> The interarytenoid is inactive during oral closure for all three classes, but it is markedly suppressed for the aspirated stops. It is more active for the onset of voicing following an aspirated stop. Vocalis activity parallels that of the interarytenoid for unaspirated and aspirated stops. For ejectives, the vocalis and lateralis are both especially active during oral closure, and their activity subsides after oral release. By contrast, the interarytenoid is inactive during oral closure for ejectives, and its activity peaks following release for the onset of voicing. Attempts to record from the posterior cricoarytenoid and cricothyroid were unsuccessful. ^ Bolivian Quechua is one language that makes use of these three particular classes of voiceless stops to effect linguistic distinctions. Although the results of this study do not necessarily indicate the manner in which a Quechua speaker 2 ̆ 7 s larynx operates in producing this three-way stop distinction, it is possible to state that this way of manipulating the larynx is one way of producing the phonetic categories of unaspirated, aspirated, and glottalized stops, such as those found in Bolivian Quechua. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince {{the last}} decades, the {{development}} of fundamental knowledge on mechanics and multi-physics phenomena driving biological systems has enabled the outstanding improvement of biomaterials able to mimic the mechanical behaviour of human soft tissues. Vocal-fold tissues are very challenging to replace as they possess specific abilities to endure large reversible deformations and to vibrate {{up to more than}} thousand cycles per second. Such unique performances result from complex physical and biomechanical features which remain poorly understood so far. This is mainly ascribed to a lack of knowledge of their unique macro-and microstructures, very difficult to investigate experimentally [1, 2]. The 3 D characterization of each constitutive element at the micrometric scale is a current challenge using confocal microscopy (limited depth of field), micro-IRM (limited spatial resolution) or X-ray microtomography in absorption mode (low sensitivity to distinguish fresh biological components owning similar absorptive properties). The present work aims (i) at characterizing the 3 D microscale arrangement of the vocal-fold tissue on excised anatomical samples by means of X-ray synchrotron phase-contrast microtomography; (ii) at studying the relationship between 3 D microstructure and vocal-fold biomechanical behaviour using a multiscale modeling approach. Regarding the experimental part, 7 human larynges have been scanned at mean (12. 3 μm) and high-resolution (0. 65 μm), using X-ray microtomographs of the ESRF's ID 19 beamline. Histological colorations have allowed a comparative analysis of the acquired images using optical microscopy. A morphological and histological database will be presented, quantifying the 3 D geometries, orientations and densities of vocal-fold fibrous structure.

Regarding the theoretical part, a recent 2 D micro-mechanical model of the vocal folds [3] has been improved to account for the 3 D fibrous networks of the tissue.

40|$|Background. The {{influence}} of muscle relaxation on the intra-operative neuromonitoring of the recurrent laryngeal nerve during thyroid surgery is unclear. Methods. In a prospective study involving 200 patients undergoing elective thyroid surgery, the {{influence of}} muscle relaxation on neuromonitoring of the recurrent laryngeal nerve was investigated. The patients received balanced anaesthesia with oxygen–nitrous oxide–isoflurane, and rocuronium bromide {{was used as the}} non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. The degree of relaxation was monitored continuously by accelerometry [twitch (% TW) ]. Summed action potentials (SAcP) obtained from the <b>vocalis</b> <b>muscle</b> were characterized by the area under the electromyographic curve expressed in millivolt seconds. Results. Evoked potentials were obtainable in all patients and at all time points. With decreasing neuromuscular blockade {{a significant increase in the}} potentials evoked at the <b>vocalis</b> <b>muscle</b> was observed. At 0 % TW SAcP was 1. 27 (SD 1. 02) mV s.

Harmonic Focus decrease operative time, hospital stay, postoperative drainage and postoperative hypoparathyroidism. Intraoperative RLN injury causes are section (mistake in surgical technique); ligature (without transection); mistake in haemostasis and dissection manoeuvres; stretch/traction; excessive traction during the medial traction of the thyroid lobe; excessive aspiration near to the nerve (suction); compression/contusion/pressure; thermal/electrical injury; diffusion by haemostatic devices; ischemia; ligation of the inferior pole vessels before identifying RLN; excessive dissection of the nerve with ischemia. Evolution of RLN monitoring was from intra-operative invasive techniques to non-invasive surface electrodes (endotracheal tube). Positive acoustic signal following stimulation of the vague nerve and the RLN always means: <b>vocalis</b> <b>muscle</b> is intact and positive acoustic signal only by RLN stimulation usually means: RLN paresis (nerve lesion distal to the stimulation site).

The massive vocal fold is large and lacks any rostrally directed flexible structures. It is supported by a large cymbal-like fibroelastic pad. Vocal tract length was measured in the course of dissection and in computer tomographic images. Two rep-resentative spectrograms, one of an adult male and one of a juvenile, recorded in the natural habitat of the Mon-golian gazelle are presented. In the spectrograms, the centre frequency of the lowest band is about 500 Hz in the adult male and about 790 Hz in the juvenile. The low pitch of the adult male’s call is ascribed to the evolutionar...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. These days, {{the main}} {{injection}} laryngoplasty technique is cricothyroid (CT) approach. However, {{patients who have}} previously undergone other neck treatments, such as thyroidectomy or neck dissection have distorted anatomical landmark makes this approach more difficult. The {{aim of this study}} is to determined the efficiency of transcartilaginous (TC) approah as compared with CT approach for unilateral vocal fold paralysis patients, especially for previously neck treated patients. Methods. From March 2005 to February 2008, 137 consecutive injection laryngoplasties were performed in patients with unilateral glottic insufficiency. Percutaneous injection was performed under local anesthesia into the <b>vocalis</b> <b>muscle,</b> using disposable 25 G 4 cm long needles through the cricothyroid membrane or directly through the thyroid cartilage. Of the 137 patients, 124 completed acoustic, perceptual, stroboscopic, and subjective evaluations prior to the injection and at 3 months after the injection. Results. In the 124 patients, the CT and TC approaches were used in 94 and 30 patients, respectively. Acoustic and perceptual parameters (GRBAS, MPT, jitter, shimmer), voice handicap index, and grades of mucosal waves and glottic closure were significantly improved after the injection in both the CT and TC groups (P< 0. 05). Only two patients (6. 6 %) had penetration difficulties, because of ossification of the thyroid cartilage. The overall success rates of the CT and TC approaches were 86. 2 %, 93. 3 %, respectively. However, the success rate of the TC approach in patient...|$|E
