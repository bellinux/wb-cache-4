25|$|The ADR 79/01 vehicle {{standard}} (Australian Design Rule 79/01 – Emission Control for Light Vehicles, 2005) is the Australian {{equivalent of}} OBD-II. It {{applies to all}} vehicles of category M1 and N1 with a gross <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Weight</b> rating of 3500kg or less, registered from new within Australia and produced since January 1, 2006 for petrol (gasoline) engined cars and since January 1, 2007 for diesel engined cars. For newly introduced models, the regulation dates applied a year earlier – January 1, 2005 for petrol and January 1, 2006 for diesel. The ADR 79/01 standard was supplemented by the ADR 79/02 standard which imposed tighter emissions restrictions, applicable to all vehicles of class M1 and N1 with a gross <b>vehicle</b> <b>weight</b> rating of 3500kg or less, from July 1, 2008 for new models, July 1, 2010 for all models.

25|$|<b>Vehicle</b> <b>weight</b> {{influences}} {{the size and}} cost of a system's guideways, which are in turn {{a major part of}} the capital cost of the system. Larger vehicles are more expensive to produce, require larger and more expensive guideways, and use more energy to start and stop. If vehicles are too large, point-to-point routing also becomes more expensive. Against this, smaller vehicles have more surface area per passenger (thus have higher total air resistance which dominates the energy cost of keeping vehicles moving at speed), and larger motors are generally more efficient than smaller ones.|$|E
25|$|All current designs (except for the human-powered Shweeb) are {{powered by}} electricity. In {{order to reduce}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>weight,</b> power is {{generally}} transmitted via lineside conductors rather than using on-board batteries. According to the designer of Skyweb/Taxi2000, J. Edward Anderson, the lightest system is a linear induction motor (LIM) on the car, with a stationary conductive rail for both propulsion and braking. LIMs are used in {{a small number of}} rapid transit applications, but most designs use rotary motors. Most such systems retain a small on-board battery to reach the next stop after a power failure.|$|E

25|$|Eight Z06-R were {{constructed}} by Callaway Competition GmbH in Leingarten, Germany, for the 2006 season. The French team Riverside campaigned a three car team. In {{an effort to}} achieve parity among the disparate participants of the GT3 Series, three forms of handicapping were applied by the FIA regulators: additional <b>vehicle</b> <b>weight,</b> ride height, and tire compound selection. The Corvettes were raced with all three handicaps employed. The Z06R won the FIA GT3 European Championship in its second year of entry. By 2011, all Z06-R teams discontinued their racing efforts in GT3, ending the car's FIA career. Z06-Rs are also campaigned in national championships.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} {{considered}} usually {{consists of a}} number of stages including: materials extraction, processing and manufacturing, product use, and product disposal. If the most environmentally harmful of these stages can be determined, then impact on the environment can be efficiently reduced by focusing on making changes for that particular phase. For example, the most energy-intensive life phase of an airplane or car is during use due to fuel consumption. One of the most effective ways to increase fuel efficiency is to decrease <b>vehicle</b> <b>weight,</b> and thus, car and airplane manufacturers can decrease environmental impact in a significant way by replacing heavier materials with lighter ones such as aluminium or carbon fiber-reinforced elements. The reduction during the use phase should be more than enough to balance additional raw material or manufacturing cost.|$|E
25|$|In 1904, many {{national}} motor clubs {{banded together to}} form the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus (AIACR). In 1922 the Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI) was empowered on behalf of AIACR to regulate Grand Prix racing {{and other forms of}} international racing. Since the inception of Grand Prix racing, competitions had been run in accordance with a strict formula based on engine size and <b>vehicle</b> <b>weight.</b> These regulations were virtually abandoned in 1928 with an era known as Formula Libre when race organisers decided to run their events with almost no limitations. From 1927 to 1934, the number of races considered to have Grand Prix status exploded, jumping from five events in 1927, to nine events in 1929, to eighteen in 1934 (the peak year before World War II).|$|E
50|$|The harness saddle {{supports}} {{the weight of}} the shafts or pole, and in a two-wheeled vehicle, also supports part of the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>weight.</b> In addition, it offers a base for fittings such as terrets and a point of attachment for a bearing rein.|$|R
2500|$|To {{create a}} rugged, {{lightweight}} shell, Porsche adopted an aluminium and Aramid (Kevlar) composite for body use {{along with a}} Nomex floor, instead of the steel normally used on their production cars.

5000|$|When {{accelerating}} {{or driving}} uphill, the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>weight</b> shifts rearward, reducing front wheel traction, causing the transmission to automatically send torque {{to the rear}} wheels to compensate. When braking or driving downhill, the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>weight</b> shifts towards the front, reducing rear wheel traction. The transmission again compensates by sending torque to the front wheels for better steering control and braking performance. If the automatic is placed in reverse or first gear, the transmission divides the torque 50-50 to both front and rear wheels. [...] The manual transmission cars are set up with a near 50/50 torque split as a base setting, and it varies from there. Essentially, the manual cars are set up with more bias towards the rear than the automatic cars.|$|R
