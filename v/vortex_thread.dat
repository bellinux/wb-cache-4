40|$|Toroidal modes in {{the form}} of {{so-called}} Hopfions, with two independent winding numbers, a hidden one (twist s), which characterizes a circular <b>vortex</b> <b>thread</b> embedded into a three-dimensional soliton, and the vorticity around the vertical axis (m), appear in many fields, including field theory, ferromagnetics, and semi- and superconductors. Such topological states are normally generated in multicomponent systems, or as trapped quasilinear modes in toroidal potentials. We uncover that stable solitons with this structure can be created, without any linear potential, in the single-component setting with the strength of repulsive nonlinearity growing fast enough from the center to the periphery, for both steep and smooth modulation profiles. Toroidal modes with s= 1 and vorticity m= 0, 1, 2 are produced. They are stable for m= 1, and do not exist for s> 1. An approximate analytical solution is obtained for the twisted ring with s= 1, m= 0. Under the application of an external torque, it rotates like a solid ring. The setting can be implemented in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) by means of the Feshbach resonance controlled by inhomogeneous magnetic fields. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author’s final draft...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} and interaction of coaxial vortex rings in the FitzHugh-Nagumo excitable medium. We find that <b>threading</b> <b>vortex</b> rings with a vortex string results in significant qualitative {{differences in their}} evolution and interaction. In particular, threading prevents the annihilation of rings in a head-on collision, allows generic ring overtaking, and can even reverse the direction of motion of a ring. We identify that an important mechanism for producing this new behaviour is that <b>threaded</b> <b>vortex</b> rings interact indirectly via induced twisting of the <b>threading</b> <b>vortex</b> string.

40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} we {{calculate}} the velocity field {{and distribution of}} stream function for ideal incompressible fluid, induced by a different system of <b>vortex</b> <b>threads</b> in a finite frustum of the cone. An original method was {{used to calculate the}} radial and axial components of the velocity vectors. Such a procedure allows us to calculate the velocity fields inside the cylinder depending on the arrangement, on the intensity and on the radius of circular vortex lines. In this paper we have developed original mathematical model for new type of ecologically clean and energetically effective device for producing electricity by the wind power.

40|$|In type-II superconductors, the flux-free state (Meissner state) may be {{invaded by}} {{vortices}} bearing quantized flux once H {{is above the}} lower critical field Hc 1. However, the actual first flux penetration does not occur at Hc 1 due {{to the presence of}} a surface barrier {{and the fact that the}} Meissner state may also exist as a metastable state up to a larger (superheating) field. In this work we determine the field for the first vortex penetration in superconductors by directly imaging the first <b>vortex</b> <b>threading</b> a superconducting Pb film with antidots. We find that the first vortex penetration occurs when the surface superconducting currents reach the depairing current, locally breaking superconductivity and allowing a vortex to nucleate. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{determine}} {{the conditions under}} which a spin-liquid Mott insulator | 0 > defined by a Gutzwiller projected BCS state at half-filling is Z(2) fractionalized. We construct a trial vison [Z(2) vortex] state |V> by projecting an (hc/ 2 e) <b>vortex</b> <b>threading</b> the hole of a cylinder/torus and examine its overlap with | 0 > using analytical and numerical calculations. We find that generically the overlap vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, so the spin-liquid is Z(2) fractionalized. We point out the relevance of these results to numerical studies of Hubbard-like models and spin models which have been recently reported to possess spin liquid phases. We also consider possible implications for flux-trapping experiments that have tested for Z(2) fractionalization in underdoped high temperature superconductors.

Quantitative analysis gives an estimate of the pinning force and the coupling between the stacks.

Maxwell drew several strips that mostly demonstrated subjects relating to physics, like the vibrations of a harp string or Helmholtz's <b>vortex</b> rings <b>threading</b> through each other.

40|$|When {{investigating}} low-frequency (0. 1 Hz) oscillations of miltiphase high-temperature cuprate superconductors (HTSC) Bi 1, 7 Pb 0, 3 Sr 2 Ca(n- 1) CunOy (n= 2 - 30), a wide attenuation peak with a maximal at T= 200 K detected. This peak {{was particularly}} pronounced in field cooling (FC) experiments, i. e. after abrupt cooling {{of the sample}} in the external magnetic field at the temperature T less Tc with subsequent slow warming up to room temperature with invariance of applied field. The attenuation peak height depended on the preliminary orientation (before cooling) of the samples in the measured permanent magnetic field H. On the one hand, it is well khow that, after the FC procedure and subsequent slow warming up, at the temperatures close to the critical temperature Tc, the attenuation peak associated with "melting" of the Abrikosov frozen vortex structure and its disappearance at T more Tc is detected in monophase samples. At the same time, in most multiphase bismuth HTSC samples, synthesized using solar energy and superfast quenching of the melt, the attenuation peak with the maximum at T= 200 K was observed. Depending on the conditions of synthesis, the attenuation peak could be two-humped and could {{be located in the}} temperature range much wider than Tc of the major superconducting phase. We assume that {{this is due to the}} existence of frozen magnetic fluxes (after FC) in superconducting "dropping" regions, which gradually (with increasing temperature) transfer into the normal state and release pinned <b>vortex</b> <b>threads.</b> This fact could be a sause of observed dissipative processes, so as also the evidence of the existence of superconductivity at T more 240 K...|$|R

Unpaired Majorana bound states may exist in a <b>vortex</b> line that <b>threads</b> the layers if the spin-orbit coupling has certain in-layer components but, interestingly, only if a nonzero supercurrent is maintained along the vortex.

40|$|Differential {{rotation}} {{between a}} neutron star crust and the more rapidly rotating interior superfluid leads to frictional heating that affects the star's long-term thermal evolution and surface emission. The frictional heating rate {{is determined by the}} mobility of the <b>vortex</b> lines that <b>thread</b> the rotating superfluid, and which likely pin to the inner crust lattice. Vortex lines move through the lattice through quantum tunneling or thermal activation, depending on the temperature. Here we present the results of thermal evolution simulations based on two models of the vortex pinning forces. We consider standard and accelerated (URCA process on quarks) processes, the effects of superfluidity, magnetic fields, and temperature gradients. If frictional heating is ignored, the effective temperature deduced observationally for PSR 0656 + 14 lies between the standard and accelerated cooling models, suggesting severe supression of a rapid neutrino emission process; if frictional heating is accounted for, less severe supression is required...|$|R
