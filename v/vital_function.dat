5|$|Archaea {{were split}} {{off as a}} third domain {{because of the large}} {{differences}} in their ribosomal RNA structure. The particular RNA molecule sequenced, known as 16s rRNA, is present in all organisms and always has the same <b>vital</b> <b>function,</b> the production of proteins. Because this function is so central to life, organisms with mutations of their 16s rRNA are unlikely to survive, leading to great stability in the structure of this nucleotide over many generations. 16s rRNA is also large enough to retain organism-specific information, but small enough to be sequenced in a manageable amount of time. In 1977, Carl Woese, a microbiologist studying the genetic sequencing of organisms, developed a new sequencing method that involved splitting the RNA into fragments that could be sorted and compared to other fragments from other organisms. The more similar the patterns between species were, the more closely related the organisms.|$|E

The eye's tissues and structures {{that are in the}} visual axis (and also the tissues adjacent to it) affect the quality of the image.

The posterior part of the retina, called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is responsible for, among many other things, absorbing light that crosses the retina so it cannot bounce {{to other parts of the}} retina. Interestingly, in many vertebrates, such as cats, where high visual acuity is not a priority, there is a reflecting tapetum layer that gives the photoreceptors a [...] "second chance" [...] to absorb the light, thus improving the ability to see in the dark.

60|$|Yet poetry, {{though the}} last and finest result, is a natural fruit. As {{naturally}} as the oak bears an acorn, and the vine a gourd, man bears a poem, either spoken or done. It is the chief and most memorable success, for history is but a prose narrative of poetic deeds. What else have the Hindoos, the Persians, the Babylonians, the Egyptians done, that can be told? It is the simplest relation of phenomena, and describes the commonest sensations with more truth than science does, and the latter at a distance slowly mimics its style and methods. The poet sings how the blood flows in his veins. He performs his functions, and is so well that he needs such stimulus to sing only as plants to put forth leaves and blossoms. He would strive in vain to modulate the remote and transient music which he sometimes hears, since his song is a <b>vital</b> <b>function</b> like breathing, and an integral result like weight. It is not the overflowing of life but its subsidence rather, and is drawn from under {{the feet of the}} poet. It is enough if Homer but say the sun sets. He is as serene as nature, and we can hardly detect the enthusiasm of the bard. It is as if nature spoke. He presents to us the simplest pictures of human life, so the child itself can understand them, and the man must not think twice to appreciate his naturalness. Each reader discovers for himself that, with respect to the simpler features of nature, succeeding poets have done little else than copy his similes. His more memorable passages are as naturally bright as gleams of sunshine in misty weather. Nature furnishes him not only with words, but with stereotyped lines and sentences from her mint.|$|E

6000|$|Thereupon I {{wrote an}} {{immediate}} reply. We met in cabinet to [...] consider the case. Lord Palmerston {{started on the}} line he had [...] marked out. I think he proposed to use some meaningless words in [...] the House of Commons as to the value we set on our privileges, and [...] our determination to defend them if attacked, by way of garniture [...] to the act of their abandonment.

[...] Lord John, Gibson, and I were for decided action. Argyll leaned [...] the same way. Newcastle was for inquiry to end in a declaratory [...] resolution. Villiers thought some step necessary. Grey argued [...] mildly, inclined I think to inaction. Herbert advised resignation, [...] opposed any other course. Somerset was silent, which I conceive [...] meant inaction.
