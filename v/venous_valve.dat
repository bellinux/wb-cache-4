25|$|Lymph {{is formed}} from the fluid that filters {{out of the}} blood {{circulation}} to nourish cells. This fluid returns through venous capillaries to the blood circulation through the force of osmosis in the venous blood; however, {{a portion of the}} fluid that contains proteins, cellular debris, bacteria, etc. must return through the lymphatic collection system to maintain tissue fluid balance. The collection of this prelymph fluid is carried out by the initial lymph collectors that are blind-ended epithelial-lined vessels with fenestrated openings that allow fluids and particles as large as cells to enter. Once inside the lumen of the lymphatic vessels, the fluid is guided along increasingly larger vessels, first with rudimentary valves to prevent backflow, which later develop into complete valves similar to the <b>venous</b> <b>valve.</b> Once the lymph enters the fully valved lymphatic vessels, it is pumped by a rhythmic peristaltic-like action by smooth muscle cells within the lymphatic vessel walls. This peristaltic action is the primary driving force, moving lymph within its vessel walls. The regulation of the frequency and power of contraction is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system. Lymph movement can be influenced by the pressure of nearby muscle contraction, arterial pulse pressure and the vacuum created in the chest cavity during respiration, but these passive forces contribute only a minor percentage of lymph transport. The fluids collected are pumped into continually larger vessels and through lymph nodes, which remove debris and police the fluid for dangerous microbes. The lymph ends its journey in the thoracic duct or right lymphatic duct, which drain into the blood circulation.|$|E

40|$|Background: Chronic venous {{insufficiency}} (CVI) represents a major {{global health problem}} with increasing prevalence and morbidity. CVI is due to an incompetence of the <b>venous</b> <b>valves,</b> which causes <b>venous</b> reflux and distal venous hypertension. Several {{studies have focused on}} the replacement of diseased <b>venous</b> <b>valves</b> using xeno- and allogenic transplants, so far with moderate success due to immunologic and thromboembolic complications. Autologous cell-derived tissue-engineered <b>venous</b> <b>valves</b> (TEVVs) based on fully biodegradable scaffolds could overcome these limitations by providing non-immunogenic, non-thrombogenic constructs with remodeling and growth potential. Methods: Tri- and bicuspid <b>venous</b> <b>valves</b> (n= 27) based on polyglycolic acid-poly- 4 -hydroxybutyrate composite scaffolds, integrated into self-expandable nitinol stents, were engineered from autologous ovine bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and endothelialized. After in vitro conditioning in a (flow) pulse duplicator system, the TEVVs were crimped (n= 18) and experimentally delivered (n= 7). The effects of crimping on the tissue-engineered constructs were investigated using histology, immunohistochemistry, scanning electron microscopy, grating interferometry (GI), and planar fluorescence reflectance imaging. Results: The generated TEVVs showed layered tissue formation with increasing collagen and glycosaminoglycan levels dependent on the duration of in vitro conditioning. After crimping no effects were found on the MSC level in scanning electron microscopy analysis, GI, histology, and extracellular matrix analysis. However, substantial endothelial cell loss was detected after the crimping procedure, which could be reduced by increasing the static conditioning phase. Conclusions: Autologous living small-diameter TEVVs can be successfully fabricated from ovine BM-MSCs using a (flow) pulse duplicator conditioning approach. These constructs hold the potential to overcome the limitations of currently used non-autologous replacement materials and may open new therapeutic concepts for the treatment of CVI in the future...|$|R

Embryos lacking Osr1 expression usually die before birth due to deformed atrioventricular junctions and hypoplastic venous valves; the ones that progress to term also have an incomplete parietal pericardium.

50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the fourth}} week, a crest grows that leaves the cephalic part. This crest is {{the first part of the}} septum primum. The two ends of the septum extend into the {{interior}} of the endocardial cushions in the atrioventricular canal. The opening between the bottom edge of the septum primum and endocardial cushions is the ostium primum (first opening). The extensions of the upper and lower endocardial pads grow along the margin of the septum primum and close the ostium primum. Coalescence of these perforations will form the ostium secundum (second opening), which allows blood to flow freely from the right atrium to the left. When the right of the atrium expands due to the incorporation of the pole of the sinus, a new fold appears, called the septum secundum.

40|$|Superficial {{veins of}} the upper {{extremity}} are the primary location for placement of peripheral IV catheters (PIVC). It is believed that {{a significant portion of}} PIVCs placed may cross or abut valves and branching veins or occlude {{a significant portion of the}} vein, limiting the ability to aspirate blood from the PIVC. Two separate clinical investigations using ultrasound were performed to understand the potential interaction between PIVCs and the vein lumen and the <b>venous</b> <b>valves</b> and branches of the superficial veins {{of the upper}} extremity. One study with 35 adult volunteers interrogated 210 vein segments where a PIV would likely be placed. A second pediatric study evaluated 35 vein segments central to indwelling PIVCs. The combined data from the two studies showed that over 80 % of adult veins and 85 % of pediatric veins can properly accommodate 20 -gauge and 22 -gauge PIVC, respectively. <b>Venous</b> <b>valves</b> are frequent findings, either immediately peripheral to branching veins or at periodic 5 to 7 [*]cm points. Antegrade blood flow can be restricted by a placed PIVC, while retrograde flow is very likely to be restricted by <b>venous</b> <b>valves.</b> Together, these findings may explain the difficulty in reliable aspiration of blood from PIVC...|$|R
40|$|The {{calf muscle}} pump is a {{mechanism}} which increases venous return and thereby compensates for the fluid shift towards the lower body during standing. During a muscle contraction, the embedded deep veins collapse and venous return increases. In the subsequent relaxation phase, muscle perfusion increases {{due to increased}} perfusion pressure, as the proximal <b>venous</b> <b>valves</b> temporarily reduce the distal venous pressure (shielding). The superficial and deep veins are connected via perforators, which contain valves allowing flow in the superficial-to-deep direction. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate and quantify the physiological mechanisms of the calf muscle pump, including the effect of <b>venous</b> <b>valves,</b> hydrostatic pressure, and the superficial venous system. Using a one-dimensional pulse wave propagation model, a muscle contraction is simulated by increasing the extravascular pressure in the deep venous segments. The hemodynamics are studied in three different configurations: a single artery-vein configuration with and without valves and a more detailed configuration including a superficial vein. Proximal <b>venous</b> <b>valves</b> increase effective <b>venous</b> return by 53 % by preventing reflux.

40|$|BackgroundReflux {{of blood}} through incompetent <b>venous</b> <b>valves</b> {{is a major}} cause of the venous {{hypertension}} that underlies clinical manifestations of chronic venous disease, including varicose veins, lipodermatosclerosis, and venous ulcers. ObjectiveTo review published literature relating to animal models in which venous hypertension has been produced and which have yielded information on the mechanisms by which venous hypertension may trigger inflammation and cause changes in the skin and <b>venous</b> <b>valves.</b> MethodsMedline searches, with additional papers identified from reference lists in published papers. ResultsAt least three types of animal model were identified that have contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the trigger mechanisms and role of inflammatory processes in chronic venous disease. These models involve venous hypertension induced either by acute venular occlusion, placement of a chronic arteriovenous fistula, or ligation of several large veins. Model results suggest that elevated venous pressure and altered flow can trigger inflammatory cascades in the vein wall and <b>venous</b> <b>valves</b> which can cause progressive valvular incompetence and eventual valvular destruction, and which are also important in the skin changes associated with venous disease. Treatment with agents that reduce oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals and that inhibit the inflammatory cascade can prevent the progressive deterioration of function in valves exposed to elevated venous pressure and can prevent the development of reflux blood flow. ConclusionsUnderstanding these processes suggests potential therapeutic targets that could be effective in slowing or preventing progression, and could help promote a more positive and proactive attitude towards treatment of the underlying disease process, rather than the later manifestations of chronic venous disease...|$|R
