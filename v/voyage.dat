5|$|In 1995, Mau {{took part}} in the Nā ʻOhana Holo Moana <b>voyage</b> of Hōkūle‘a to Ra‘iātea. Sailing with his son Sesario Sewralur, and Nainoa as sailing master, Mau watched as Nainoa's {{students}} Kaʻau McKenney and Keahi Omai served as navigators. Mau had seen Nainoa succeed in the 1980 and 19851987 voyages; finally, in this 1995 <b>voyage,</b> Mau saw proof that the knowledge was carried forward to the next generation. The canoe landed successfully at Rarotonga, and the <b>voyage</b> resulted in the lifting of a six-centuries-old taboo on voyaging from Ra‘iātea. Hōkūle‘a had sailed from Hawaii with sisterships Hawaiiloa and Makalii; the canoes rendez-voused at Taputapuatea with other voyaging canoes from across Oceania.|$|E
5|$|Sydney, with 7 RAR on board, and the {{destroyer}} escort Yarra departed from Sydney for the sixteenth <b>voyage</b> on 16 February 1970. They arrived in Vietnam on 27 February, with Sydney embarking 5 RAR for the <b>voyage</b> to Fremantle, where they arrived on 5 March. On 16 April, Sydney {{was one of}} 45 vessels from 13 nations assembled in Sydney Harbour to celebrate the Australian Bicentenary, marking James Cook's discovery of {{the east coast of}} Australia. Later that month, a visit to Portland, Victoria coincided with the Bicentenary Royal Tour of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh. Sydney sailed from Fremantle on 21 October on the seventeenth <b>voyage</b> to Vietnam. The troopship met {{the destroyer}} Vendetta off Manila, and reached Vietnam on 31 October, where 2 RAR was offloaded and 8 RAR embarked. The two ships departed a day later, with Sydney reaching Brisbane on 12 November. At the start of February 1971, the troopship visited Hobart to serve as the flagship of the Royal Hobart Regatta, before she sailed to Adelaide, embarked 3 RAR, then departed on her eighteenth Vietnam <b>voyage</b> on 15 February. Sydney met the destroyer escort Yarra en route, with both ships reaching Vũng Tàu on 25 February, where 7 RAR boarded for the return <b>voyage.</b> On 2 March, two days before reaching Fremantle, the ashes of Rear Admiral Harold Farncomb were scattered from Sydney.|$|E

40|$|The English Queen Elizabeth I {{supported}} naval exploration. English <b>voyages</b> overseas {{differed in}} character {{according to their}} destinations. At first, <b>voyages</b> northward had been pure <b>voyages</b> of discovery aimed at finding a northwest passage. Only later on, they also became <b>voyages</b> of colonization. The closer the English colonists approached Florida, which was under Spanish rule, the more danger they faced. <b>Voyages</b> southward had always been <b>voyages</b> of piracy as South America belonged to the Portuguese and Spanish spheres of influence. The character of English naval <b>voyages</b> was also determined by the geographical location of the British Isles. For the English, finding a northwest or a northeast passage {{would have been very}} profitable. In the forty years of the reign of Elizabeth I, England evolved into a naval power that could challenge Spanish and Portuguese domination in the New World...|$|R

5|$|Any {{extended}} ocean <b>voyage</b> without {{fresh water}} or food would prove {{difficult for a}} large, warm-blooded (homeothermic) mammal, but today many small, nocturnal species of lemur exhibit heterothermy, which allows them to lower their metabolism and become dormant while living off fat reserves. Such a trait in a small, nocturnal lemur ancestor would have facilitated the ocean <b>voyage</b> and could have been passed on to its descendants. However, this trait has not been observed in the closely related lorisoids studied to date, and could have evolved on Madagascar {{in response to the}} island's harsh environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|Finney {{disagreed}} with the accidental <b>voyaging</b> portion of Sharp's hypothesis. To investigate the problem, he founded the Polynesian <b>Voyaging</b> Society with Herb Kane and Tommy Holmes in 1973, intent on building a <b>voyaging</b> canoe to sail from Hawaii to Tahiti to test whether intentional two-way <b>voyaging</b> throughout Oceania could be replicated. With the help of Mau's navigational knowledge guiding Hōkūle‘a, the Polynesian <b>Voyaging</b> Society demonstrated that intentional <b>voyaging</b> was not only possible, but also the ancestors of the Polynesians could have settled the Pacific on similar <b>voyages</b> using non-instrument wayfinding techniques such as Mau's. Finally, linguistic and archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} history of the Polynesian people does not originate in the East Pacific but in the West. Recent developments in the field of DNA analysis have unequivocally settled the debate of Polynesian origin. They prove Polynesians share common ancestry with indigenous Taiwanese and East Asians.|$|R
25|$|During {{the course}} of the <b>voyages,</b> Ming China had become the {{pre-eminent}} naval power of the early 15th century.

It is not exactly known why the <b>voyages</b> completely ended in 1433. Duyvendak suggested that the complete cessation of the expeditions was partly due to the considerable expenses. Whatever it may be, the costs for undertaking the <b>voyages</b> had not overburdened the Ming treasury. The trade was still flourishing long after the <b>voyages</b> had ceased. Chinese ships continued to control the Eastern Asian maritime trade. They also continued trading around India and East Africa.|$|R

5|$|Aside {{from the}} probe, The <b>Voyage</b> Home {{required}} no new starship designs. The USS Saratoga, the first Federation starship disabled by the probe, was the USS Reliant model from The Wrath of Khan. The Bird-of-Prey model from The Search for Spock was reused, but ILM built additional sturdy versions for The <b>Voyage</b> Homes action sequences. The {{inside of the}} Bird-of-Prey was represented by a different set than The Search for Spock, but the designers made sure to adhere to a sharp and alien architectural aesthetic. To give the set a smokier, atmospheric look, the designers rigged display and instrumentation lights to be bright enough that they could light the characters, {{rather than relying on}} ambient or rigged lighting. While Paramount had instructed ILM to trash the large Spacedock model created for The Search for Spock, the team had been loath to discard the complicated model and its miles of fiber optic lighting. When The <b>Voyage</b> Home called for the return of Spacedock, ILM had only to reassemble the model from storage.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1969, the RAN's ship {{designation}} and numbering system was altered from the British pennant system to a new system based on the United States' hull classifications: Sydney was assigned the pennant number P214.

Sydney and the destroyer escort Derwent arrived in Vũng Tàu on 15 February and departed the same day with 1 RAR embarked, with the troopship reaching Townsville on 25 February. A training cruise in March saw the ship visit New Zealand and Fiji. Sydneys fourteenth <b>voyage,</b> to deliver 6 RAR to Vietnam and return with 4 RAR, commenced on 8 May when Sydney sailed from Townsville. She met the destroyer Vampire off Singapore on 14 May, reached Vũng Tàu five days later, and arrived back in Brisbane on 30 May. On 17 November, Sydney and the destroyer Duchess departed Brisbane on the troopship's fifteenth <b>voyage</b> to Vietnam, with 8 RAR aboard. The ships reached Vũng Tàu on 28 November; 8 RAR was replaced by 9 RAR, which was delivered to Fremantle on 5 December.|$|E
