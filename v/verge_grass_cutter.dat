40|$|Current energy {{production}} {{is done in}} a way that cannot be sustained ultimately. Biomass is ideal as a sustainable alternative because it can be used in the existing energy infrastructure. For coal power plants <b>verge</b> <b>grass</b> is one of the products being considered for co-firing. The moisture content and its bioactivity currently prevent direct co-firing on a large scale. A very new and promising pre-treatment technique to counter this is wet torrefaction. Wet torrefaction does not evaporate the moisture, it allows a precise temperature and thus process control, high heat transfer and a combined washing out of unwanted salts. To predict the decomposition of <b>verge</b> <b>grass</b> during wet torrefaction a reaction model was set up. Hemicellulose and cellulose kinetic data was used from previous work on corn cob and pure cellulose. The model was tested with data from research on sugar maple wood meal decomposition. Wet torrefaction experiments showed that <b>verge</b> <b>grass</b> decomposes very rapidly in contrary to the model. Experiments done on xylan showed a very slow decomposition. Bagasse decomposition was very hard to monitor because very little decomposition products were detected. A possible explanation could be that grass is very young and thus has a low degree of polymerization. Xylan and bagasse on the other hand are already treated and therefore the toughest parts of the original material are being torrefied. Overall the biomass species had a very high solid mass loss. <b>Verge</b> <b>grass</b> and bagasse retained around 30 % of the original mass and no solid residue was found with xylan. The solid fraction and liquid fraction that could be accounted for is lower than half of the original mass. Although additional tests are needed to accurately predict the decomposition of <b>verge</b> <b>grass</b> a design was made for a pre-treatment plant. This facility was regarded as a stand-alone facility and consists of several parallel CSTR’s and a heat exchanger. The needed calculations are performed to compare wet torrefaction with alternatives.

Objective: This current study develop prediction model of independent and dependent variable that induce to loss of grip strength using non-linear neural network and linear multiple regression prediction approach for both hands. Linear and non-linear approach was used the direct least square and activation sigmoid function, respectively. Method: 204 hand held <b>grass</b> <b>cutter</b> worker have been selected as the subject study due hand arm vibration exposure during operation which is significant to loss hand grip strength. The independent variables consist of age, height, weight, working experience and estimated vibration exposure per day while hand grip strength {{was selected as the}} dependent variables. Result: The performance indexes of regression are better fit for neural network compared to multiple regressions with 0. 017 (right hand grip) and 0. 066 (left hand grip) differences, respectively. The mean square error also stated near to “ 0 ” for non-linear compared to linear techniques. Conclusion: It concludes that the neural network model is superior to the linear model.

40|$|<b>Verge</b> <b>grass</b> {{is being}} {{considered}} to replace expensive wood pellets (thus reducing imports) as potential bio-energy resources {{for use in}} co-firing. However, drying of these <b>verge</b> <b>grass</b> resources is very important because of its high moisture content (almost 60 % wt.) and also results in an increased heating value for the fuel. Drying is the first process which occurs before torrefaction of biomass (which serves as an important pre-treatment step before co-firing with coal). Though fixed bed drying models have been studied in the past, development of drying models for drying <b>verge</b> <b>grass</b> have {{so far not been}} investigated. The drying of <b>verge</b> <b>grass</b> in fixed bed using a system of coupled differential equations in the gas phase and algebraic equations in the solid phase have been used to setup mass and energy balances has been investigated. The system of differential and algebraic equations has been solved by the Runge-Kutta method using ordinary differential equation solvers available in MATLAB® and by using finite difference techniques. The behaviour of the process variables (air humidity, air temperature, solid moisture content and solid temperature) with time and height has been investigated. Further a sensitivity analysis has been performed to study the effect of the influence of varying process parameters such as inlet air flow rate and temperature on the drying process. To validate the model, data from experiments performed with grass on a lab-scale drying and torrefaction setup were used at the Energy Technology research group have been used. With increase in the inlet air flow rate and the air temperature the drying time period was reduced due to an increase in the drying rate.

40|$|The {{selection}} of power generation systems is important when striving {{for a more}} sustainable society. However, the results of environmental, economic and social sustainability assessments are subject to {{new insights into the}} calculation methods and to changing needs, economic conditions and societal preferences. Researchers active in the field of exergy and sustainability claim that exergy losses and sustainability are related. The Total Cumulative Exergy Loss method and the exergy replacement costs of minerals are used to assess and compare power generation systems that make use of fossil and renewable energy carriers. These power generation systems are the following: an ultrasupercritical coal power plant, a power plant that co-fires coal and biomass, a wind farm, and a combined cycle power plant that uses bioethanol originating from the fermentation of <b>verge</b> <b>grass.</b> Furthermore, environmental, economic and social sustainability assessment methods are applied to assess the four power generation systems as well. On the basis {{of the results of the}} assessments, it is concluded that the wind farm system is preferred from the environmental, social and exergetic sustainability points of view, but not from the economic sustainability viewpoint. The advantage of the exergetic sustainability assessment method is that its results are not influenced by choices like whether <b>verge</b> <b>grass</b> should be considered a waste product or not. The influence of the exergy replacement costs on the results of the exergetic assessment is small, because less than 5 per cent of the exergy input of the systems during construction, operation and commission is of mineral origin. When looking at the infrastructural part of the systems only, the influence of the exergy replacement costs is larger because about 25 to 40 per cent of the exergy input is of mineral origin. accepted authors manuscriptEnergy & IndustryPetroleum Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Power {{generation}} from biomass {{is mentioned}} {{as a means to}} make our society more sustainable as it decreases greenhouse gas emissions of fossil origin and reduces the dependency on finite energy carriers, such as coal, oil and natural gas. When assessing the sustainability of power generation from biomass, {{it is important to consider}} the supply chain of the used biofuel by conducting a life cycle assessment of the system. Besides regular sustainability assessments, such as the calculation of the environmental sustainability, attention should be paid to exergy losses, i. e. the loss of 'energy quality', caused by the system as a whole, because every process and activity is accompanied with the loss of exergy and because the amount of exergy on earth can only be replenished by capturing new exergy from solar and tidal energy. This research compares the use of livestock manure and <b>verge</b> <b>grass</b> for power generation by assessing the systems from an environmental as well as an exergetic life cycle point of view. The assessed systems are the following: combustion of bioethanol from the fermentation of <b>verge</b> <b>grass,</b> combustion of substitute natural gas from anaerobic digestion of cow and pig manure and combustion of substitute natural gas from supercritical water gasification of cow and pig manure. The environmental sustainability is assessed by calculating ReCiPe endpoint indicators and the exergetic sustainability is assessed by applying the relatively new Total Cumulative Exergy Loss (TCExL) method. The TCExL method considers all exergy losses caused by a technological system during its life cycle, i. e. the internal exergy loss caused by the conversion of materials and energy, the abatement of emissions and the exergy loss related to land use. In addition to comparing the three systems as well as both assessment methods, the influence of taking into account the system's by-products as 'avoided products' and via 'allocation' on the assessment results is investigated. The bioethanol system appears more sustainable from an environmental sustainability point of view, while the bioethanol and supercritical water gasification systems are preferred from an exergetic sustainability point of view. The indicator of the environmental sustainability assessment is highly influenced by the way of taking into account by-products, while the exergetic sustainability indicator is not. </p...|$|R
