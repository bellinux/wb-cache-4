The school would send students for auditions regularly, which led to an audition for the original London production of Bye Bye Birdie, although she wasn't offered a role.

25|$|After {{the three}} beats of silence that open the score, a tubular bell is struck three times <b>very</b> <b>quietly</b> (pianissimo), with 12 beats between the strikes and gap of 18 beats {{between the groups}} of three. This bell tells {{of the death of}} Britten—it is the funeral bell. It {{continues}} to be struck in groups of three widely spaced intervals for most of the piece, fading out for a time in the last 21 bars, only to reappear at the last. After the bell has struck there is a brief pause for three beats of silence, and then the first violins begin setting the pattern which the rest of the ensemble will follow at slower speeds. Half of the first violins begin playing the descending A minor scale, playing first one note from the very top of their range, then returning to the beginning and playing two notes, and then three and four and so on. The other half of the violins play notes from an A minor chord. These notes start a fourth lower and drop in pitch only when it is overrun by the first. This creates a swirling effect of increasing tension which is relieved by dropping the note. They begin playing <b>very</b> <b>quietly</b> (pianississimo) but gradually over the piece build up until they are playing very loudly (fortississimo).|$|E
25|$|Then, unexpectedly, Tej and Rish are {{reunited with}} nearly their entire family. Their {{relatives}} {{have come to}} Barrayar to acquire the financial resources needed to attempt to take back their House. Tej's grandmother knows of an underground Cetagandan bunker forgotten since the Cetagandan invasion had been defeated a century ago. It is filled with looted treasure, {{but it turns out}} that Imperial Security's headquarters has inadvertently been built just across the street from where the bunker is buried. Ivan is drawn into the scheme to dig their way to it (<b>very</b> <b>quietly</b> using an experimental biological organism). When the smuggler the baron had hired to transport the treasure trove proves to be more interested in the bounty on the family, the entire scheme falls apart, literally explosively, and they end up trapped in the bunker. Fortunately, Imperial Security digs them out and Ivan secures his future happiness with Tej.|$|E

500|$|Kafka {{grew up in}} Prague as a German-speaking Jew. He {{was deeply}} fascinated by the Jews of Eastern Europe, who he thought possessed an {{intensity}} of spiritual life that was absent from Jews in the West. His diary is full of references to Yiddish writers. Yet he was at times alienated from Judaism and Jewish life: [...] "What have I in common with Jews? I have hardly anything in common with myself and should stand <b>very</b> <b>quietly</b> in a corner, content that I can breathe". In his adolescent years, Kafka had declared himself an atheist.|$|E
500|$|During the band's {{performance}} at the Monsters of Rock festival in Castle Donington, England, in August 1988, two fans were crushed to death when many in the crowd of 107,000 began slam-dancing to [...] "It's So Easy". Rose had halted the show several times to calm the audience. From then on, he became known for personally addressing disruptive fans and giving instructions to security personnel from the stage, at times stopping concerts to deal with issues in the crowd. In 1992, Rose stated, [...] "Most performers {{would go to a}} security person in their organization, and it would just be done <b>very</b> <b>quietly.</b> I'll confront the person, stop the song: 'Guess what: You wasted your money, you get to leave.'" [...] As a result of the deaths at Monsters of Rock, the festival was canceled the following year.|$|E
500|$|With Chief {{buried and}} Master crying over a dead dog he trains Copper to ignore all foxes except for Tod. Over {{the span of}} the two animals' lives, man and dog hunt the fox, the Master using over a dozen hunting {{techniques}} in his quest for revenge. With each hunt, both dog and fox learn new tricks and methods to outsmart each other, Tod always escaping in the end. Tod mates with an older, experienced vixen who gives birth to a litter of kits. Before they are grown, the Master finds the den and gasses the kits to death. That winter, the Master sets out leg hold traps, which Tod carefully learns how to spring, but the vixen is caught and killed. In January, Tod takes a new mate, {{with whom he has}} another litter of kits. The Master uses a [...] "still hunting" [...] technique, in which he sits <b>very</b> <b>quietly</b> in the wood while playing a rabbit call to draw out the foxes. With this method, he kills the kits; then by using the sound of a wounded fox kit, he is also able to draw out and kill Tod's mate.|$|E

500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan" [...] {{took place}} in the Upper Boat Studios on 23 March 2012, alongside that for the episode [...] "Asylum of the Daleks". The final episode Gillan and Darvill shot as Amy and Rory was actually the previous episode, [...] "The Power of Three". Nevertheless, Gillan and Smith got very emotional filming the final graveyard scene. Amy and Rory's scene on the rooftop was filmed in a car park in Cardiff, Wales, with a greenscreen standing in for the New York skyline. To create the effect of the two plunging down, Gillan and Darvill were suspended upside-down by wires and raised and lowered. Much of the episode was filmed in Central Park in New York City in April 2012. The filming was attended by thousands of American fans, which surprised the cast and crew. Other scenes were shot at night in the city, {{as well as by the}} East River in front of the Brooklyn Bridge and in the Tudor City apartment complex. Moffat was in New York City when he came up with the story, and thought it was appropriate for the Weeping Angels. He described the city as [...] "a different backdrop" [...] to shoot a Doctor Who story in, and made use of its architecture. Fellow executive producer Caroline Skinner felt that the location [...] "has such scale and romance" [...] which [...] " [...] the episode a real atmosphere and a very different tone for Doctor Who". The week spent filming in the city was done by a [...] "small unit by American standards" [...] according to producer Marcus Wilson. They did not take any props of Angels or the TARDIS, which were instead added in post-production. Filming for the episode also occurred at a cemetery in Llanelli. During post-production, the New York skyline was inserted into the cemetery scenes. Gillan insisted on reading Amy's afterword to Smith when his reaction was filmed. They were not expecting it to be in front of a crowd in Central Park, and Smith said he had to [...] "treat this like a play". Because the content was so secret, Gillan had to read <b>very</b> <b>quietly</b> and Smith could not hold the real page because a spectator might take a picture of it. Gillan found that she only had one page of the script, and had to improvise the rest.|$|E

2500|$|On 25 April, {{upwards of}} 10,000 Falun Gong {{practitioners}} assembled peacefully near the Zhongnanhai government compound in Beijing to request {{the release of}} the Tianjin practitioners and an end to the escalating harassment against them. It was Falun Gong practitioners' attempt to seek redress from the leadership by going to them and, [...] "albeit <b>very</b> <b>quietly</b> and politely, making it clear {{that they would not be}} treated so shabbily." [...] It was the first mass demonstration at the Zhongnanhai compound in PRC history, and the largest protest in Beijing since 1989. Several Falun Gong representatives met with then-premier Zhu Rongji, who assured them that the government was not against Falun Gong, and promised that the Tianjin practitioners would be released. The crowd outside dispersed peacefully, apparently believing that their demonstration had been a success.|$|E
2500|$|The phrase [...] "We're gonna {{ride to the}} Abbey of Thelema" [...] in {{the song}} [...] "Misery Machine" [...] is a {{reference}} to Aleister Crowley's Abbey of Thelema, which {{was used as the}} Headquarters from which the doctrines of Thelema would be spread throughout the world. The song also contains a sample from [...] "Beep Beep" [...] by The Playmates. A few seconds after the track, begins an untitled hidden track: the sample, [...] "Go home to your mother! Doesn't she ever watch you!? Tell her this isn't some Communist daycare center! Tell your mother I hate her! Tell your mother I hate you!" [...] is spoken by Stole from the Waters film Desperate Living. After this, a telephone can be heard ringing <b>very</b> <b>quietly</b> for several minutes, which is then followed by an irate answering machine message, presumably from a mother of a Manson fan.|$|E

2500|$|The American Society for Psychical Research wanted further investigation. In 1926, a {{committee}} of three professors (Knight Dunlap, Henry C. McComas and Robert Williams Wood) was sent to Boston. Crandon had a luminous star attached to her forehead, identifying the location of {{her face in the}} dark. After a few minutes, a narrow dark rod appeared over a luminous checkerboard which had been placed on the table opposite Crandon. It moved from side to side and picked up an object. As it passed in front of Wood he lightly touched it with the tip of his finger and followed it back to a point very near Crandon's mouth. Wood thought it probable she was holding the rod by her teeth. He took hold of the tip and <b>very</b> <b>quietly</b> pinched it. It felt like a knitting needle covered with one or two layers of soft leather. Though the committee had been warned that touching the ectoplasm could result in the illness or death of the medium, neither Crandon nor the [...] "ectoplasm" [...] rod showed any reaction to Wood's actions. At the end of the sitting, Wood dictated his actions to the stenographer. Upon hearing this, Crandon gave a shriek and fainted. She was carried {{out of the room and}} the committee was asked to depart. Wood was never invited again.|$|E
2500|$|At bar 65 {{the first}} violins hit middle C, {{and when they}} do they cease playing the A minor scale and simply play C {{continuously}} {{until the end of the}} piece (i.e., for more than 250 beats). Eleven bars later the second violins hit a low A and play that continuously. Similarly the other voices gradually find the note that they have been seeking and once reached, they play it continuously until the end. The last to lock into place are the contrabasses which alight on a low A in bar 103. At this stage the whole ensemble is playing an A minor chord very very loudly, and this continues for five bars, then on the second beat of the last bar they suddenly stop. At that moment the bell is struck <b>very</b> <b>quietly</b> (pianissimo) so that the striking itself is not heard, but only the reverberations as it dies away. [...] As the final bell toll reverberates, with all other instruments silent, the overtones of the bell become prominently audible – in particular, the fourth overtone (fifth partial), which is the note C-sharp, i.e., the major third of the fundamental pitch (A) of the entire piece. [...] This creates a striking effect, as the entire piece is set in the key of A minor, so that in the dying echoes of the final bell, the last thing the listener hears is actually an A major chord contained within the overtones of the bell. [...] This evokes the common Renaissance and Baroque technique called the [...] "Picardy third", in which a piece set in a minor mode or key nonetheless ends on a major chord, evoking a ray of light piercing through the clouds, and suggesting hope, resurrection, or redemption. [...] Here, however, the effect is subtle, because it arises solely from the overtones of a single strike of the bell, rather than from separate instruments or voices.|$|E
