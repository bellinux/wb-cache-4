40|$|Background: Besides the {{strategy}} based on test-and-slaughter policy for seropositive {{sheep and goats}} after {{an evaluation of the}} situation, vaccination measure of those animals against brucellosis with Rev 1 vaccine in 2008 have been implemented. Aims: To examine the influence of the new measure for control and eradication of brucellosis in sheep and goats on the incidence of human brucellosis before and after vaccination with B. melitensis Rev. 1. Material and methods: This is a retrospective study in which comparison of the incidence of human brucellosis in the three regions has been made depending on the vaccination procedure in sheep and goats one year before the implementation of the vaccination (2007) and 4 years later. Data for the infected sheep and goats were obtained from the Food and <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Agency</b> and data for human brucellosis were obtained from the Institute of Public Health of the Republic of Macedonia. Results: The greatest decrease in the incidence of human brucellosis (from 124. 3 to 19. 7 / 100, 000 inhabitants) was registered in the region 3 where mass vaccination of sheep and goats was conducted. The highest incidence rate of brucellosis in sheep and goats was registered in 2007 (2010 / 100, 000 sheep and goats) and the lowest in 2011 (156 / 100, 000 sheep and goats). Periodic prevalence of brucellosis in sheep and goats prior to vaccination was 6882 / 100, 000 sheep and goats and after vaccination 3698 / 100, 000 sheep and goats (p< 0. 05). There was a moderate positive correlation between the number of infected individuals with brucellosis and the number of infected sheep and goats (r= 0. 26). Conclusion: Decline of the incidence of human brucellosis {{is one of the major}} indicators for successfully implemented new control programs and strategies for prevention and eradication of brucellosis in sheep and goats. Vaccination was good measure to control brucellosis in the 3 regions...|$|E

40|$|Avian {{influenza}} virus (H 5 N 1) is a rapidly disseminating infection that affects poultry and, potentially, humans. Because the avian virus has already adapted to several mammalian species, decreasing {{the rate of}} avian-mammalian contacts is critical to diminish {{the chances of a}} total adaptation of H 5 N 1 to humans. To prevent the pandemic such adaptation could facilitate, a biology-specific disease surveillance model is needed, which should also consider geographical and socio-cultural factors. Here we conceptualized a surveillance model meant to capture H 5 N 1 -related biological and cultural aspects, which included food processing, trade, and cooking-related practices, as well as incentives (or disincentives) for desirable behaviours. This proof-of-concept was tested with data collected from 378 Egyptian and Nigerian sites (local [backyard] producers/ live bird markets /village abattoirs/ commercial abattoirs and <b>veterinary</b> <b>agencies).</b> Findings revealed numerous opportunities for pathogens to disseminate, as well as lack of incentives to adopt preventive measures, and factors that promoted epidemic dissemination. Supporting such observations, the estimated risk for H 5 N 1 -related human mortality was higher than previously reported. The need for multi-dimensional disease surveillance models, which may detect risks at higher levels than models that only measure one factor or outcome, was supported. To develop efficient surveillance systems, interactions should be captured, which include but exceed biological factors. This low-cost and easily implementable model, if conducted over time, may identify focal instances where tailored policies may diminish both endemicity and the total adaptation of H 5 N 1 to the human species.

40|$|Background: Johne's disease (JD) {{caused by}} Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) {{represents}} {{a real threat}} to the agriculture and dairy food industries and {{believed to be a}} potential public health problem. Signs of infection in ruminant include weight loss, diarrhea, decreased milk production, and eventually death. The definition of an infected animal based either on the presence of anti-MAP antibodies, or positive bacterial culture. No treatment for the disease exists and controlling the disease is difficult due to its long latent period. JD is a worldwide problem and multiple studies in many countries have been carried out to determine the prevalence of MAP infections. Although some primary non intensive studies confirm presence of JD in Egypt, the disease is currently neglected by the official Egyptian <b>veterinary</b> <b>agencies.</b> There is no official data, no national control program, and no used vaccine. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate three conventional diagnostic methods for MAP under the Egyptian circumstances with a general aim to determine the appropriate strategy to develop a JD control program. These methods were pooled fecal culture, humoral response and insertion sequence IS 900 targets polymerase chain reaction (IS 900 PCR). Materials and Methods: Fecal and serum samples (500 each) were collected from Holstein-Friesian cattle and buffaloes housed in five Egyptian governorates. Fecal samples were examined for MAP {{on the basis of a}} strategic pooling procedure and performed on Herrold's Egg Yolk Agar Medium (HEYM). Smears were prepared from developed colonies and stained using a Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) technique. The identity of developed colonies was further confirmed by PCR analysis of IS 900 sequence. Sera from both culture-positive and culture-negative animals were evaluated individually for humoral response. Results: Out of 50 pooled specimens, 34 (68...|$|R
