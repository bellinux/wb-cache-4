25|$|On September 29, 2003, Heatley {{was driving}} a Ferrari 360 Modena with Thrashers {{teammate}} Dan Snyder in the passenger seat. Heatley, who was driving between 55–82mph in a 35mph zone, lost control and skidded into a brick pillar and iron fence. Six days later, Snyder died from his injuries. Heatley was charged with <b>vehicular</b> <b>homicide</b> {{as a result of}} the crash. He pleaded guilty to second-degree <b>vehicular</b> <b>homicide,</b> driving too fast for conditions, failure to maintain a lane, and speeding. He was sentenced to three years probation and ordered to give 150 speeches on the dangers of speeding, and pay $25,000 to Fulton County for the cost of investigating the crash.|$|E
25|$|On February 23, 2001, a <b>vehicular</b> <b>homicide</b> {{and assault}} {{occurred}} in the student community of Isla Vista, California, near the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus. Four {{people were killed and}} a fifth, who suffered critical injuries, died in October 2016. The driver, David Attias, was ruled legally insane and sentenced to 60 years at a mental institution. In September 2012 the court approved Attias' conditional release into a monitored program.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, traffic {{laws are}} {{regulated}} by the states and municipalities through their respective traffic codes. Most of these are based {{at least in part}} on the Uniform Vehicle Code, but there are variations from state to state. In states such as Florida, traffic law and criminal law are separate, therefore, unless someone flees a scene of an accident, commits <b>vehicular</b> <b>homicide</b> or manslaughter, they are only guilty of a minor traffic offense. However, states such as South Carolina have completely criminalized their traffic law, so, for example, one is guilty of a misdemeanor simply for travelling 5 miles over the speed limit.|$|E
40|$|Does the {{economic}} model of optimal punishment explain {{the variation in}} the sentencing of murderers? As the model predicts, we find that murderers with a high expected probability of recidivism receive longer sentences. Sentences are longest in murder types where apprehension rates are low, and where deterrence elasticities appear to be high. However, sentences respond to victim characteristics {{in a way that}} is hard to reconcile with optimal punishment. In particular, victim characteristics are important determinants of sentencing among <b>vehicular</b> <b>homicides,</b> where victims are basically random and where the optimal punishment model predicts that victim characteristics should be ignored. Among <b>vehicular</b> <b>homicides,</b> drivers who kill women get 56 percent longer sentences. Drivers who kill blacks get 53 percent shorter sentences. ...|$|R
5000|$|By 2003, crime {{had been}} {{increasing}} along the Strip. From January 2003 to May 2003, 107 robberies, 73 aggravated assaults, 10 shootings, five rapes, several attempted <b>vehicular</b> <b>homicides,</b> and several successful <b>vehicular</b> <b>homicides.</b> In {{almost all of}} the violent crimes reported on the Richmond Strip, automobiles were a key aspect, while guns were not always a key aspect. John Nova Lomax of the Houston Press said [...] "In other words, guns don't kill people, but people who keep guns in their cars kill people." [...] William Martin, a sociologist from Rice University, said that he suspected that many of the perpetrators had consumed alcohol. By June 2003 multiple violent crimes had occurred in the Richmond Strip. Around July 2003, shootings occurred in three weekends in a row. This caused the HPD Westside Division to more strictly enforce laws against illegal U-turns at the intersection of Hillcroft Road and the 6300 and 6400 blocks of Richmond. In the year leading up to July 28, 2003, nine people were injured and five people were killed in violent attacks in the Richmond Strip. In 2011 Richard Connelly of the Houston Press said that the Richmond Strip was [...] "not generally known for outright murder." ...|$|R

2500|$|On September 29, 2003, Heatley {{was seriously}} injured after he {{lost control of}} the Ferrari 360 Modena he was driving. The car struck a wall, {{splitting}} the car in half and ejecting him and his passenger, teammate Dan Snyder. Heatley suffered a broken jaw, a minor concussion, a bruised lung and a bruised kidney, and he tore three ligaments in his right knee; Snyder was critically injured, with a skull fracture, and died six days later, on October 5, of sepsis. Heatley was charged with vehicular homicide; he pleaded guilty to second-degree <b>vehicular</b> <b>homicide,</b> driving too fast for conditions, failure to maintain a lane and speeding. He admitted to drinking prior to the incident, but his blood-alcohol content was below the legal limit. He was sentenced to three years probation, and the judge, Rowland W. Barnes (the same judge later murdered by Brian Nichols in 2005), required the court to approve Heatley's vehicle, which could not have more than six cylinders and would not surpass 70mph (112km/h). [...] Heatley avoided having to go to trial as part of a plea deal that dropped the first-degree charge of <b>vehicular</b> <b>homicide.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Strait and {{his family}} were struck with tragedy when his 13-year-old daughter, Jenifer, was killed in a one-car non-alcohol-related accident. She was riding in a Ford Mustang driven by Gregory Wilson Allen, 18, of Staples, Texas. He was {{subsequently}} charged with a Class A misdemeanor for <b>vehicular</b> <b>homicide.</b> [...] Mike Cox, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety in Austin, said [...] "The responding trooper determined the cause of accident to be excessive speed and that the car did not negotiate the turn properly. Jenifer was riding in the front passengers seat and none of the four occupants were wearing seat belts at the time. When the vehicle flipped over onto its passenger's side, Jenifer was partially ejected, causing her to be dead upon impact. The incident caused Strait to greatly limit his contact with the media. He stopped doing interviews for many years after the accident as he {{and his family}} did not wish to discuss Jenifer's death.|$|E

40|$|Violence {{and violent}} death are {{everyday}} events in present-day South Africa. Although this phenomenon {{may be attributed}} in great part to the sociopolitical environment, {{the single most important}} underlying common factor is the presence of alcohol in both the perpetrators of violence and their victims. We retrospectively studied 948 cases of 2, 980 medicolegal autopsies done over a 5 -year period. We found that 52. 5 % of cases tested positively for alcohol, with blood alcohol concentration varying from 0. 008 to 0. 048 g% (mean = 0. 18). Male patients were more common and more likely to be positive than female patients. Breakdown of the cases into various modes of death showed that <b>homicides,</b> <b>vehicular</b> accidents, and suicides predominated. The results are in agreement with earlier studies done locally and elsewhere. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{statistics}} from Oregon indicate that 701 persons died by suicide in 2012. That was 30 % {{greater than the}} number of deaths from <b>vehicular</b> accidents, <b>homicide,</b> and HIV/AIDS combined. Oregon’s suicide rate in 2011, 16. 9 per 100, 000 persons, was far above the national average of 12. 4. The rate among Oregon males ages 20 - 24 was a shocking 29. 3. By way of comparison, the death rate from breast cancer was 12. 4 per 100, 000. Suicide ranks as the second leading cause of death in Oregon among people ages 15 - 34. But this is not for lack of care. Nationally, 35 percent of those who took their lives were being treated for mental illness {{at the time of their}} deaths and 45 % of all suicide victims had contact with primary care providers within one month of taking their own lives. (Shen & Millet, 2013; Luoma et. al. 2002) Communication between primary care providers and/or mental health practitioners and family members of patients seeking treatment for mental illness improves the quality of care provided to these patients, reduces the risk of suicide and self-harm behaviors, and encourages the use of community resources to improve overall outcomes for these patients. While confidentiality is a fundamental component of a therapeutic relationship, it is not an absolute, and the safety of the patient overrides the duty of confidentiality. Misunderstandings by clinicians about the limitations created by HIPAA, FERPA, and state laws for preserving confidentiality of patients has caused unnecessary concern regarding disclosure of relevant clinical information.
