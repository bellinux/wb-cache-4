40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the jumping {{performance}} of female and male <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> and male wrestlers by static, counter, drop and repetitive jumping methods. 20 female and 20 male <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> which play in 2. league and 3. league and 20 national wrestlers voluntarily participated the study. All subjects were students in Physical Education and Sports Department. The mean ages were 21. 15 years for female <b>volleyball</b> <b>players,</b> 20. 80 years for male <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> and 20. 60 years for wrestlers. All subjects performed static jump, counter jump, drop jump and repetitive jump. Values were measured by New Test Power Timer System 300 Series Instrument. Body Mass Indeks (BMI), flexibility and body fat percentage values was determined. The values between three groups were compared by Kruskall Vallis Test. For the pairwise comparison Mann Whitney-U test was used. Flexibility values compared between athletes it has found that wrestlers were more flexible than male <b>volleyball</b> <b>players.</b> Height, BMI, body fat percentage were found significantly different between subjects, Drop, static, counter movement and repetitive jump height and power values were found significantly higher in male <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> than female <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> and wrestlers. Static and counter movement jump values were found significantly higher in wrestlers than female <b>volleyball</b> <b>players.</b> A higher jumping value of male <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> than wrestlers is related sports branch. While better jumping performance of female <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> than wrestlers is expected, gender factor passed in front of this situation. As a conclusion, sports branch and gender factor have an important factor on jumping performance...|$|R
40|$|Due to high {{training}} {{loads and}} frequently repeated unilateral exercises, {{several types of}} sports training {{can have an impact}} on the process of posture development in young athletes. The objective of the study was to assess and compare the postures of adolescent male <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> and their non-training peers. The study group comprised 104 <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> while the control group consisted of 114 non-training individuals aged 14 - 16 years. Body posture was assessed by the Moiré method. The <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> were significantly taller, and had greater body weight and fat-free mass. The analysis of posture relative to symmetry in the frontal and transverse planes did not show any significant differences between the <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> and non-athletes. Postural asymmetries were observed in both the <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> and the control participants. Lumbar lordosis was significantly less defined in the <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> compared to non-training individuals while no difference was observed in thoracic kyphosis. All athletes demonstrated a loss of lumbar lordosis and an increase in thoracic kyphosis. Significant differences in anteroposterior curvature of the spine between the <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> and the non-athletes might be associated with both training and body height. Considering the asymmetric spine overloads which frequently occur in sports training, meticulous posture assessment in young athletes seems well justified. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the speed and agility between {{handball}} and <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> of Annamalai University. We have selected thirty (30) male students who play either handball or Volleyball from Department of Physical Education and Sports Sciences, Annamalai University. These subjects were equally classified into two groups (handball = 15 & Volleyball = 15). The selected subjects were tested on speed by 50 yard dash and agility by shuttle run which was selected as criterion variable. The collected data was analysed using independent t test to find out the significant difference between handball and <b>volleyball</b> <b>players.</b> The result of our study showed that handball players have greater speed than <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> (t = 5. 82). However, no difference is elicited between handball and <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> (t = 0. 82). It is concluded that speed and agility plays a vital role in both game, however handball players showed greater speed than <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> may be because of intermittent nature and employ sprint during attack and counter attack during the game...|$|R

40|$|Determination of body {{composition}} {{is an essential}} parameter in training athletes because the fat to muscle ratio might improve physical performance in many types of sports. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the morphological characteristics of competitive female college student <b>volleyball</b> <b>players.</b> For this purpose, body weight, height and body fat were assessed in 16 female college student volleyball players（ age： 19. 1 （ SD： 1. 1 ） years old）, and in 30 non continuous sports playing female college students （age： 20. 0 （ 0. 9 ） years old）. Maximal oxygen consumption was evaluated in 6 <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> and in 5 non <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> chosen from two groups randomly. Significant differences in height, body weight, maximal oxygen consumption and percent of body fat between the two groups were demonstrated, with the <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> being significantly taller, heavier, having larger maximal oxygen consumption and a lower percentage of body fat. There was no significant difference in BMI between the two groups.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was: a) to provide {{reference}} values for the standing spike test for female <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> and b) to study whether the standing spike test is valid for assessing the theoretical differences between female <b>volleyball</b> <b>players.</b> The sample included 83 players from the first nine teams of the Spanish women’s first volleyball division (52 Spanish players and 31 from other nationalities). The variables studied were the ball speed of the standing spike test, the age of the players, the player’s role (outside hitter, opposite, middle-blocker, libero, or setter), height, and nationality of the players (Spanish or foreign). The results demonstrate the ranges for the standing spike among female performance <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> (70 - 82 km[*]·[*]h- 1). The differences regarding nationality, player role, height, and age seem to indicate that the test is a valid instrument for monitoring the performance of female <b>volleyball</b> <b>players...</b>|$|R
40|$|With {{the aim of}} validating the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory on a {{population}} of young Croatian <b>volleyball</b> <b>players,</b> 286 examinees, 106 male and 180 female <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> (average age of 16. 09 ± 1. 83), filled out the CSAI- 2, constructed by Martens, Vealey, Burton, Bump and Smith (1990) 1. Given {{the fact that all}} scales of the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory have good homogeneity, reliability and sensitivity, it can be concluded that they represent high-quality measuring instruments for measuring psychological characteristics of young <b>volleyball</b> <b>players.</b> Young male and female <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> generally have a moderate level of self-confidence, and their cognitive anxiety is more prominent that somatic anxiety. In order to determine the age and gender differences in somatic and cognitive anxiety and self-confidence, parametric analysis of differences was performed and coefficients of the independent samples t-test were calculated. By analysis of differences according to age, it has been established that female junior players, in relation to female youth players, express a significantly lower level of somatic and cognitive anxiety and a significantly higher level of self-confidence. As opposed to female players, male youth and junior players do not differ in any of the analysed variables. By analysis of differences according to gender, it has been established that male youth players have a significantly higher level of self-confidence in comparison to female youth players. No significant differences were found in the level of competitive anxiety and self-confidence by analysis of variance between different player roles. No significant differences were found by discriminant analysis in somatic and cognitive anxiety, and self-confidence of female <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> of different situational efficacy. The group of least efficient male <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> is characterized by a very low level of self-confidence, while the most efficient group of <b>volleyball</b> <b>players</b> is characterized by a somewhat lower level of cognitive and somatic anxiety...|$|R
