25|$|During the Risorgimento (Italian unification) of the 19th century, many Piemontese {{winemaker}}s {{and land}} owners played a pivotal role. The famous Italian patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi was a winemaker {{who in the}} 1850s introduced {{the use of the}} Bordeaux mixture to control the spread of oidium that was starting to ravage the area's vineyards. Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour was a wealthy <b>vineyard</b> <b>owner</b> who went abroad to study advance viticulture prior to founding the political newspaper Il Risorgimento. He was highly influential in the adoption of many French viticultural techniques among the Piemontese vineyards.|$|E
25|$|Monks and monasteries of the Roman Catholic Church {{have had}} an {{important}} influence {{on the history of}} Burgundy wine. The first known donation of a vineyard to the church was by king Guntram in 587, but the influence of the church became important in Charlemagne's era. The Benedictines, through their Abbey of Cluny founded in 910, became the first truly big Burgundy <b>vineyard</b> <b>owner</b> over the following centuries. Another order which exerted influence was the Cistercians, founded in 1098 and named after Cîteaux, their first monastery, situated in Burgundy. The Cistercians created Burgundy's largest wall-surrounded vineyard, the Clos de Vougeot, in 1336. More importantly, the Cistercians, extensive vineyard owners as they were, were the first to notice that different vineyard plots gave consistently different wines. They therefore laid the earliest foundation for the naming of Burgundy crus and the region's terroir thinking.|$|E

He played a Victorian butler in Forever and a Day (1943) and an Australian bar-owner in The Man from Down Under (1943). Simon Callow's 1987 biography quotes a number of contemporary reviews of Laughton's performances in these films. James Agate, reviewing Forever and a Day, wrote: [...] "Is there no-one at RKO to tell Charles Laughton when he is being plain bad?" [...] On the other hand, Bosley Crowther of the New York Times declared that Forever and a Day boasted [...] "superb performances".|$|E

2500|$|... 5 892 {{vineyard}} owners owned {{more than}} 5 ha each in 1999, accounting for 57% of Germany's total vineyard surface, {{and it is}} in this category that the full-time vintners and commercial operations are primarily found. However, truly large wineries, in terms of their own vineyard holdings, are rare in Germany. Hardly any German wineries reach the size of New World winemaking companies, and only a few are of the same size as a typical Bordeaux Grand Cru Classé château. Of the ten wineries considered as Germany's best by Gault Millau Weinguide in 2007, nine had 10,2 — 19 ha of vineyards, and one (Weingut Robert Weil, owned by Suntory) had 70 ha. This means that most of the high-ranking German wineries each only produces around 100,000 bottles of wine per year. That production is often distributed over, say, 10-25 different wines from different vineyards, of different Prädikat, sweetness and so on. The largest <b>vineyard</b> <b>owner</b> is the Hessian State Wineries (Hessische Staatsweingüter), owned by the federal state of Hesse, with 200 ha vineyards, the produce of which is vinified in three separate wineries. The largest privately held winery is Dr. Bürklin-Wolf in the Palatinate with 85,5 ha.|$|E

50|$|With Federal {{and local}} {{help from the}} {{government}} many German <b>vineyard</b> <b>owners</b> were able to redesign and replant their vineyards to optimize maintenance and harvesting. Several vineyards also {{took the opportunity to}} upgrade their plantings from the lower-quality Müller-Thurgau grape to the high-quality Riesling vine. Some wine areas also improved the roads and access to their vineyards to increase tourism potential. In some cases, parcels of land that were spread out over different areas were reallocated among <b>vineyard</b> <b>owners</b> to reduce production cost.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{phylloxera}} epidemic, winemaking in the Friuli {{region was}} very muted {{and did not}} begin to garner much attention till the 1970s. The international popularity of Pinot grigio in the 1980s and 1990s help to change the dynamic of Friuli-Venezia Giulia winemaking. Prior to this time <b>vineyard</b> <b>owners</b> sold their grapes in bulk to co-ops and négociant-like wineries that would blend the grapes together. With the success of Mario Schiopetto in bottling and marketing the product of his own <b>vineyard,</b> other <b>vineyard</b> <b>owners</b> followed suit and began opening up small wineries of their own.|$|R

50|$|The Échelle des Crus was {{originally}} {{established as a}} fixed pricing structure.

2500|$|The German wine {{industry}} consists of many small <b>vineyard</b> <b>owners.</b> The 1999 viticultural survey counted 68 598 <b>vineyard</b> <b>owners,</b> down from 76 683 in Western Germany in 1989/90, {{for an average}} size of 1.5 ha. Most of the 40 625 operators of less than 0.5 ha should likely be classified as hobby winemakers. Many smaller <b>vineyard</b> <b>owners</b> do not pursue viticulture as a full-time occupation, {{but rather as a}} supplement to other agriculture or to hospitality. It is not uncommon for a visitor to a German wine region to find that a small family-owned Gasthaus has its own wine. Smaller grape-growers who do not wish to, or are unable to, commercialise their own wine have several options available: sell the grapes (either on the market each harvest year, or on long-term contract with larger wineries looking to supplement their own production), deliver the grapes to a wine-making cooperative (called Winzergenossenschaft in Germany), or sell the wine in bulk to winemaking firms that use them in [...] "bulk brands" [...] or as a base wine for Sekt. Those who own vineyards in truly good locations also have the option of renting them out to larger producers to operate.|$|R

50|$|Following the riots, the French {{government}} {{worked with}} a collaboration of <b>vineyard</b> <b>owners</b> and Champagne houses to delineate an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée for the Champagne region. Only wines produced from grapes grown within the geographical boundaries (that included the Marne, Aube {{and parts of the}} Aisne departments) could be entitled to the name Champagne. Eventually these principles were enshrined by the European Union with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status. To deal with the problem of collusion among Champagne houses and fairness in pricing, a classification system of Champagne's villages set up a price structure for the grapes. Villages were rated on a numerical 80-100 scale based on the potential quality (and value) of their grapes. The price for a kilogram of grapes was set and <b>vineyards</b> <b>owners</b> would receive a fraction of that price depending on the village rating where they were located.
