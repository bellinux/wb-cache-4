5|$|Princess Royal was a well-armed ship, {{carrying}} twenty-six 12-pounder cannon and {{a number}} of smaller calibre guns on the maindeck. The French Navy immediately took her into service as the 34-gun frigate Duguay Trouin and attached her to the Isle de France squadron of the frigates Prudente and Cybèle, and the brig <b>Vulcain</b> under Captain Jean-Marie Renaud. This force skirmished inconclusively with a squadron of East India Company ships in the Sunda Strait in January 1794, before returning to Isle de France with the captured East Indiaman Pigot.|$|E
25|$|On 25 January in the Sunda strait, Mitchell engaged a French naval {{squadron}} {{under the}} overall command of Captain Jean-Marie Renaud. The squadron had sailed from the Île de France {{and consisted of}} the frigates Prudente and Cybèle, the brig <b>Vulcain,</b> and the captured , now renamed Duguay-Trouin. The combat was inconclusive and both sides withdrew, Mitchell to Batavia.|$|E
25|$|Although the S.E.2010 was {{powered by}} Pratt & Whitney R-4360-B13 Wasp Major engines, the most {{powerful}} piston engine ever placed into production for aircraft use, a concern that the final design was underpowered led to a planned redesign. The final (15th) production aircraft {{was intended to be}} re-engined with 5,400hp Allison T40 turboprops, but production was curtailed at eight and the more advanced version was never built. An Armagnac, S.O. 2060, ended its days as an engine test-bed, alternately fitted with turbojet engines fitted in a nacelle below the fuselage. It was tested with two Snecma Atar 101 turbojets each engine having a different system of afterburner. The Snecma <b>Vulcain</b> was also tested in a similar manner.|$|E
500|$|By 13:15, Duguay Trouin was a {{battered}} wreck, with the hull significantly damaged, the bowsprit shot away and heavy casualties among the crew. With his ship unmanageable and Centurion and Resistance now [...] away and approaching rapidly, the French captain struck his colours and surrendered. The brig <b>Vulcain</b> {{had taken the}} opportunity to escape as Duguay Trouin and Orpheus fought and later reached Isle de France. Newcome lost one midshipman killed and one officer and eight men wounded in the exchange from a crew of 194. Losses on Duguay Trouin were far more severe: the French ship recorded 21 men killed and 60 wounded from a nominal complement of 403.|$|E
500|$|The booster was {{designed}} to have four independent propulsion systems, {{the first of which}} – main rocket propulsion – would be based on three gimbaled <b>Vulcain</b> engines fueled by [...] of propellant. Second, Eurojet EJ200 fly-back turbofan engines would be propelled with hydrogen to reduce fuel mass. Further, ten [...] thrusters placed {{on each side of the}} vehicle would be used by the reaction control system. Finally, the fourth propulsion system would be based on solid rocket motors that separate the boosters from the core stage. An up-scaled version of the motors used in existing EAP boosters would be mounted in the attachment ring and inside the wing's main structure.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} spring of 1794, three vessels had come out from Britain - 32-gun frigate [...] under Captain Henry Newcome, the 50-gun fifth rate [...] under Captain Samuel Osbourne, and the 44-gun [...] under Captain Edward Pakenham to replace Cornwallis's squadron. These ships passed the French bases on Isle de France en route to India, and briefly {{blockaded}} the port with some success against French merchant vessels: Orpheus alone sent three officers and twenty men to India in captured merchant ships. [...] The French too had ships at sea during this period, Duguay Trouin and <b>Vulcain</b> cruising together in the Indian Ocean during the spring before returning to Isle de France.|$|E
500|$|In the {{reference}} design, each LFBB {{consists of three}} engines installed in a circular arrangement at the aft of the vehicle. Each engine is a <b>Vulcain</b> engine with reduced expansion ratio. An additional three turbofan air-breathing engines, installed in the nose section, provide power for fly-back. The fuselage is [...] long, with an outer tank diameter of , specifically designed to match the existing Ariane 5 core stage and to reduce manufacturing costs. A low-wing V-tail canard configuration was selected, with a wingspan of approximately [...] and an area of [...] The aerofoil {{was based on a}} transonic profile from the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE 2822). The gross lift-off mass (GLOW) of each booster is , with [...] upon separation and [...] dry mass. In comparison, the GLOW for EAP P241 is [...]|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} spring of 1794, during a major {{campaign}} in the Atlantic, a British force led by Captain Peter Rainier in the 74-gun ship of the line , also including , , [...] and , {{was sent to the}} Indian Ocean. This force diverged en route, with Orpheus, Resistance and Centurion cruising off Île de France in May. On 5 May this force encountered the captured Princess Royal, now armed as a warship and renamed Duguay-Trouin, and the brig <b>Vulcain.</b> Duguay-Trouin sailed poorly and was intercepted and captured by Orpheus after a short battle. The blockade of Île de France was maintained during the year and on 22 October Renaud attempted to eliminate it, attacking Centurion and Diomede off Île Ronde. The ensuing battle was hard-fought, with a particularly ferocious duel between Centurion and Cybèle, but ultimately the British squadron was forced to withdraw to India.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 24 January, most of Mitchell's {{squadron}} lay at anchor off the island of Pulau Panjang in Bantam Bay on the northwestern tip of Java, with Nonsuch and the new prizes remaining in the Zuften Islands about [...] distant. At 06:00, sails were sighted {{in the northern part}} of the Sunda Strait passing the small island of Dwars in de Weg that were rapidly identified as three frigates and a brig. These were in fact the French naval squadron from Île de France, consisting of the frigates Prudente and Cybèle, the brig <b>Vulcain</b> and the captured Princess Royal, now renamed Duguay-Trouin, under the overall command of Captain Jean-Marie Renaud. Canning attempted to communicate with the strange vessels, but by 13:00 it was obvious from their lack of response that these were enemy ships, and the greatly outnumbered Canning made all sail northeast with his prizes to avoid destruction.|$|E
500|$|U-38 {{would spend}} {{two and a}} half months in port, before leaving for {{operations}} off the west coast of Africa on 9 April 1941. This would prove to be her most successful patrol, with the sinking of eight ships. On 4 May, the Swedish steam freighter SS Japan was torpedoed while traveling with Convoy OB-310 from England to the United States. The following day, the British motor freighter MV Queen Maud was hit and sunk. On 23 May, the Dutch motor freighter SS Berhala was sunk while traveling with the Convoy OB 318, from England to America. The British steam freighter SS <b>Vulcain</b> was torpedoed and sunk on 24 May. Six days later, on 29 May, the British steam freighter SS Tabaristan was another victim. The following day the destruction continued, the British steam freighter SS Empire Protector was sent to the bottom, as was the Norwegian steam freighter SS Rinda on the 31st. The eighth and final ship sunk during U-38 eighth patrol was the British cargo steamship [...] on 8 June. The boat then returned to Lorient on 29 June 1941, after spending eleven and a half weeks at sea.|$|E

2500|$|On 24–25 January, the EIC {{squadron}} engaged a French naval squadron from Île de France, {{consisting of}} the frigates Prudente and Cybèle, the brig <b>Vulcain</b> and the captured [...] East Indiaman , now renamed Duguay-Trouin. The two squadrons engaged at long range though Houghton and Nonsuch managed to hit Cybèle. The French broke off the engagement and the British did not pursue. Casualties among the French squadron are not known, but the only loss on the British ships was on Nonsuch, which had a man killed in combat with Cybèle.|$|E

The two squadrons engaged at long range though Houghton and Nonsuch managed to hit Cybèle. The French broke off the engagement and the British did not pursue. The need to man the prizes and to guard the prisoners, who outnumbered their captors, had left him with just enough men to man the guns. Casualties among the French squadron are not known, but the only loss on the British ships was on Nonsuch, which had a man killed in combat with Cybèle.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 January 1794, Duguay Trouin, {{under the}} command of {{under the command}} of Julien Thérouart, was in the Sunda Strait as part of a French naval {{squadron}} from Île de France, that also included the frigates Prudente and Cybèle, and the brig <b>Vulcain,</b> all four vessels under the overall command of Captain Jean-Marie Renaud. There they engaged a squadron of EIC ships consisting of the East Indiamen , , and , the country ship , the Bombay Marine (EIC) 14-gun brig Nautilus, and two recently captured French privateers, all under the overall command of Commodore Charles Mitchell. (The two privateers were the corvettes Vengeur and Résolue. On 17 January they had attacked the EIC factory at Bencoolen, where the East Indiaman Pigot had repelled them. Mitchell's squadron encountered the two on 22 January and captured them.) ...|$|E
2500|$|No {{response}} {{having come}} from the administration, Quéruel claims that Cherubini made the courageous decision to use his discretionary powers and take personal responsibility for authorising a special performance whose takings would be divided equally between the Académie and Lays. Even if {{it is unclear what}} right the director of the École royale de musique et de déclamation had to make such a decision, the performance did in fact take place at the Opéra on 20 November 1826. The programme consisted of Boieldieu's [...] opéra comique Le calife de Bagdad; the second act of Anacréon chez Polycrate, in which Lays played his most famous role for the last time; and the four-act pantomime-ballet Mars et Vénus, ou Les filets de <b>Vulcain</b> with music by Jean Schneitzhöffer. However, the evening's takings of between 6,000 and 7,000 francs were markedly inferior to those Lays's presence on stage would once have guaranteed.|$|E
60|$|In the {{experiments}} on the hybrid Hippeastrums, if Herbert {{had found that}} the pollen {{of two or three}} kinds alone had been more efficient on certain kinds than their own pollen, it might have been argued that these, from their mixed parentage, had a closer mutual affinity than the others; but this explanation is inadmissible, for the trials were made reciprocally backwards and forwards on nine different hybrids; and a cross, whichever way taken, always proved highly beneficial. I can add a striking and analogous case from experiments made by the Rev. A. Rawson, of Bromley Common, with some complex hybrids of Gladiolus. This skilful horticulturist possessed a number of French varieties, differing from each other only in the colour and size of the flowers, all descended from Gandavensis, a well-known old hybrid, said to be descended from G. natalensis by the pollen of G. oppositiflorus. (17/86. Mr. D. Beaton in 'Journal of Hort.' 1861 page 453. Lecoq however ('De la Fecond.' 1862 page 369) states that this hybrid is descended from G. psittacinus and cardinalis; but this is opposed to Herbert's experience, who found that the former species could not be crossed.) Mr. Rawson, after repeated trials, found that none of the varieties would set seed with their own pollen, although taken from distinct plants of the same variety (which had, of course, been propagated by bulbs), but that they all seeded freely with pollen from any other variety. To give two examples: Ophir did not produce a capsule with its own pollen, but when fertilised with that of Janire, Brenchleyensis, <b>Vulcain</b> and Linne, it produced ten fine capsules; but the pollen of Ophir was good, for when Linne was fertilised by it seven capsules were produced. This latter variety, on the other hand, was utterly barren with its own pollen, which we have seen was perfectly efficient on Ophir. Altogether, Mr. Rawson, in the year 1861 fertilised twenty-six flowers borne by four varieties with pollen taken from other varieties, and every single flower produced a fine seed-capsule; whereas fifty-two flowers on the same plants, fertilised at the same time with their own pollen, did not yield a single seed-capsule. Mr. Rawson fertilised, in some cases, the alternate flowers, and in other cases all those down one side of the spike, with pollen of other varieties, and the remaining flowers with their own pollen. I saw these plants when the capsules were nearly mature, and their curious arrangement at once brought full conviction to the mind that an immense advantage had been derived from crossing these hybrids.|$|E
