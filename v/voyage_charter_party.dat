30|$|The term ‘tramp {{shipping}} optimisation’ {{refers to}} the use of OR to maximise the revenue or minimise the cost of a tramp shipping problem, subject to the limited shipping resources. One such tramp shipping problem exists when there are some ships and some cargoes and it is required to find out the cargo mix assigned to each ship voyage which maximises total gross profit per day for all ships, subject to ship capacity and cargo time window (lay can). Name this problem area ‘optimisation of ship voyage’. To give more details on this area, consider the following facts. Unlike ‘optimisation in liner shipping’, both ports of call and port calling sequence are here assumed optional. Charter party, signed by the ship owner and the charterer, usually specifies terms and clauses to be followed by both parties. Non-demise voyage charter parties are assumed here. Terms generally include the following items: calling ports, calling sequence, cargo freight, cargo time window (lay can), allowable cargo handling time (lay days), dispatch count if actual days are less than lay days, and demurrage count if more. Loading and discharging lay days may be considered in reversible or irreversible manner. If reversible, lay days are specified for loading and discharging collectively. If irreversible, lay days are specified for loading and discharging separately. The gross terms of <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> are here assumed unless otherwise specified. Before cargoes are being fixed by the ship owner, ‘optimisation of ship voyage’ helps in proposing a voyage plan suggesting an optimal cargo mix for each ship. This mix maximises the sum of voyage gross profit per day for all ships, subject to ship capacity, cargo lay can, and other <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> terms. In the cargo mix selection, the random nature of sea transport demand has to be considered.|$|E
40|$|The Oil & Gas sector relies {{mainly on}} the {{maritime}} transport to ship large volumes of petroleum and products. In this sense, this paper proposes a mixed integer linear model {{whose objective is to}} determine the coastal navigation fleet size and the type of vessels to transport clean petroleum products of real company. The model’s outcome helped programmers define how many ships are actually required to meet the commitments undertaken within a pre-established planning horizon. Comparing the model’s result with the actual number of vessels available for programming, one can eventually release ships to make other journeys, thus avoiding the hiring of ships in <b>Voyage</b> <b>Charter</b> <b>Party</b> for this last purpose. It is also possible to reduce the demurrage in periods of low movement, when the fleet contracted becomes oversized...|$|E
30|$|If {{compared}} to other businesses, cargo transportation in tramp mode has three distinctive characteristics. The first characteristic is that its production cycle (ship voyage) passes through different economic systems which cause uncertainty and create unstructured decision situation (Fields and Shingles 2016). In an unstructured decision situation, solution steps are usually not known beforehand. The second characteristic is that production time (voyage time) varies considerably from one alternative production cycle to another. The production cycle {{is said to be}} time-sensitive because of this variation in time. The variation is mainly caused by the alternative cargo mixes available for transport in competition with other ships, the alternative shipping routes the ship may follow towards the same cargo mix, and the alternative ship speeds at which the ship may sail. In comparison, the production cycle in liner shipping is not sensitive to time since production time is fixed where the ship sails per a predetermined itinerary (see El Noshokaty  2013). Likewise, crop harvesting in agriculture, car manufacturing and assembly lines in industry, and road paving in construction are all not time-sensitive. Time-sensitivity is known to the ship owner when he hires his ship as a time charter for a better hire per-day, main while he ignores it when he does not hire his ship as a voyage charter for a better gross profit per day (Time Charter Equivalent rate in voyage charter is not the gross profit per day as been defined in this paper). However, the ship owner shows awareness of time sensitivity when he puts in the <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> a clause specifying a minimum cargo loading and discharging rate. His intention is to minimise voyage time. This action influences few cost and revenue items plus cargo handling days, while a gross-profit-per-day objective influences all cost and revenue items plus all voyage days, including sailing and waiting days. The gross-profit-per-day objective is more described hereinafter. The third characteristic is that transportation unit calls at a variable number of stops and follows many calling sequences among these stops. In other words, a transportation unit does not operate on a published schedule but serves different stops in response to tenders of cargo. It runs like a taxi cab in private transport if {{compared to}} a bus in public transport. This mode of operation requires, in model terminology, many variables and constraints which in turn requires the use of mathematical models (Christiansen and Fagerholt 2014).|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} major {{shipping}} companies which operate fleets comprised largely of vessels which are time chartered and subsequently sub-chartered on voyage terms. Legal risks will arise {{for the time}} charterer due the differing natures and terms of time and <b>voyage</b> <b>charters.</b> The essential question examined in this thesis is that of whether, and to what extent, legal risk can be minimized by the negotiation of equivalent contractual terms under time and <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> <b>parties.</b> The key areas addressed in this thesis are delivery under time charters compared to readiness under <b>voyage</b> <b>charters,</b> off hire under time charters versus suspension of laytime under <b>voyage</b> <b>charters,</b> obligations relating to cleanliness of cargo spaces, rights and responsibilities relative to safe berths and ports, the time charterer's position under bills of lading, and issues relating to redelivery of the vessel and consequent <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> liability if the vessel is unable to undertake the final voyage. The methodology applied is {{an examination of the}} case law, with a primary focus on the extensive body of English jurisprudence. This analysis of the case law is accompanied by a consideration of provisions of major <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> forms. The analysis leads to the conclusion that risk, to varying degrees, can be minimized through the application and clarification of contractual language. With respect to readiness of the vessel it is considered that risk will be reduced through agreeing contractual language which requires early notification of the vessel's delay. As regards off hire and laytime wording that clarifies non physical deficiencies is proposed. With regard to vessel cargo spaces intermediate cleanliness is identified as the greatest risk. Safe port and berth warranties are determined to represent an area of easily manageable risk, while letters of indemnity relating to bills of lading continue to represent very significant risk with suggested but no certain solution. Finally, with respect to redelivery a final voyage clause for time charters has been proposed which serves to almost eliminate risk in this area. Therefore, it is broadly concluded that risk can be managed but not eliminated through drafting of appropriate contractual terms...|$|R

50|$|A <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> is {{the hiring}} of a vessel and crew for a voyage between a load port and a {{discharge}} port. The charterer pays the vessel owner on a per-ton or lump-sum basis. The owner pays the port costs (excluding stevedoring), fuel costs and crew costs. The payment {{for the use of}} the vessel is known as freight. A <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> specifies a period, known as laytime, for loading and unloading the cargo. If laytime is exceeded, the charterer must pay demurrage. If laytime is saved, the <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> may require the shipowner to pay despatch to the charterer.|$|R
50|$|In {{commercial}} shipping, laytime is {{the amount}} of time allowed (in hours or days) in a <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> for the loading and unloading of cargo.

In a bareboat charter the charterer acts as the ship's operator and manager, taking on responsibilities such as providing the crew and maintaining the vessel. Finally, in a contract of affreightment or COA, the charterer specifies a total volume of cargo to be carried in a specific time period and in specific sizes, for example a COA could be specified as [...] of JP-5 in a year's time in [...] shipments.

50|$|The tramp ship is a {{contract}} carrier. Unlike a liner, often called a common carrier, {{which has a}} fixed schedule and a published tariff, the ideal tramp can carry anything to anywhere, and freight rates are influenced by supply and demand. To generate business, {{a contract}} to lease the vessel known as a <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> is drawn up between the ship owner and the charterer. There are three types of <b>charters,</b> <b>voyage,</b> time and demise.|$|R
50|$|It {{has also}} {{published}} {{a guide for}} each of the two types of contract between merchant and shipowner: Time <b>Charters</b> and <b>Voyage</b> <b>Charters.</b> In a <b>Voyage</b> <b>Charter,</b> the charterer hires the vessel for a single voyage, while the vessel’s owner provides the master, crew, bunkers and supplies. In a Time Charter, the vessel is hired for a specific amount of time. The vessel’s owner still manages the vessel but the charterer directs the vessel’s operation, and may sub-charter the vessel.|$|R
5000|$|Voyage charter: The <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> is {{the most}} common charter in tramp shipping. [...] The owner of the tramp is obligated to provide a {{seaworthy}} ship while the charterer is obligated to provide a full load of cargo. [...] This type of charter {{is the most}} lucrative, but can be the riskiest due to lack of new charterers. During a <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> a part or all of a vessel is leased to the charterer for a voyage to a port or a set of different ports. There are two types of <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> - net form and gross form. [...] Under the net form, the cargo a tramp ship carries is loaded, discharged, and trimmed at the charterer's expense. Under the gross form the expense of cargo loading, discharging and trimming is on the owner. The charterer is only responsible to provide the cargo at a specified port and to accept it at the destination port. Time becomes an issue in the <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> if the tramp ship is late in her schedule or loading or discharging are delayed. If a tramp ship is delayed the charterer pays demurrage, which is a penalty, to the ship owner. The number of days a tramp ship is chartered for is called lay days.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{outlines the}} problems that are faced by the shipowners in the dry bulk sector of the shipping industry. It indicates that charter planning plays {{a fundamental role in}} maintaining the financial viability of shipping companies. Retrospective data from specific dry bulk shipping markets was analysed in order to identify the most beneficial mix of time and <b>voyage</b> <b>charters,</b> if any. This analysis formed the basis for the development of forecasting models which were designed to improve the strategic decision taking policies in shipping companies trading in the dry bulk markets. The dry bulk shipping markets were investigated to identify the major factors that have created financial difficulties within shipping companies. This showed that the inter-relationship between the shipowner's chartering policy, purchasing policy and world economic climate was the major influence. The analysis of specific charter markets, grain and coal (United States to Europe or Japan) showed that in terms of revenue generation a combination of time and <b>voyage</b> <b>charters</b> was, in general, superior to remaining in one charter mode. A series of forecast models were used to forecast twelve months of <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> rates, these were then compared with known twelve month time charter rates to derive a charter type decision. They were also compared with the known <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> rates. The analysis of the forecasted <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> rates indicated that there was a severe limitation in the current forecasting techniques used. It was shown that in the short term a forecast could be identified, but in the long term the forecasted rates, and to a certain extent, the long term trends were not sufficiently reliable to be used as decision tools. Suggestions are included for further development of other forecast techniques and data manipulation to improve the decision making methods of the shipping company.

40|$|This {{report is}} aimed to {{investigate}} the ISPS-code and <b>voyage</b> <b>chartering,</b> and investigate how the code affects the charterer and owner. The SOLAS convention was amended in 2004 {{as a result of}} the new terror threat, and the ISPS-code was then added to the convention as an annex. The new code affects different <b>parties</b> involved in <b>voyage</b> <b>chartering,</b> and everyone has to adapt to the new routines. Furthermore, some parts of <b>voyage</b> <b>chartering</b> are more vulnerable than others. Laytime is an essential part of a ships voyage, and a vast amount of money is linked to a vessel’s portstay. A violation of the ISPS-code allows the designated authorities in charge of maintaining the protection of ships and port to intervene and investigate the cause of non-compliance during the vessels portstay. Thus, the laytime can be directly affected by the ISPS-code. The question is who is responsible for the delays and in turn the economic risk of an ISPS related delay or cancellation of voyage? As a result of our investigation, we concluded that the ISPS-code is related to the seaworthiness of a vessel. If the obligations of the security requirements are not met, the vessel can be classified as non-seaworthy. In most voyage charterparties, such as GENCON 94, there is a clause that states that the owner shall provide a seaworthy ship. In English jurisdiction, the owner’s responsibilities to provide a seaworthy ship is even a so called implied term. Hence, a breach of the ISPS-code is directly linked to the seaworthiness of the ship, and the owner is responsible for the delays caused by lack of ISPS documents and certificates...|$|R
