40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the capacity limits in a variable duty cycle VANET {{that uses the}} IEEE 802. 11 p standard. We show that the default value of duty cycle that allocates time equally between control and service channels leads to unbalanced performance and that the performance of typical traffic on those channels can be greatly improved by judicious choice of the <b>value</b> <b>for</b> <b>duty</b> cycle. We find the values of spatial density of vehicular traffic that lead to spatial saturation of network traffic. In addition, to model {{the distribution of the}} vehicles on the road segment, we used Poisson distribution, as well as Erlang-k distribution. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} in the 20th century was that the acts of demolition were often acts of desperation and last resort; a demolished house could not be <b>valued</b> <b>for</b> probate <b>duty.</b> A vacant site was attractive to property developers, who would pay a premium for an empty site that could be rebuilt upon and filled with numerous small houses and bungalows, which would return a quick profit. This was especially true {{in the years immediately}} following World War II, when Britain was desperate to replace the thousands of homes destroyed. Thus, in many cases, the demolition of the ancestral seat, strongly entwined with the family's history and identity, followed the earlier loss of the family's London house.|$|R
5000|$|Bank {{also served}} as the boxing coach at Tulane. In 1934, {{he was on a}} list of {{candidates}} for the head coaching position at the University of Texas in Austin. At the time, a San Antonio newspaper gave Bank credit for the success of Tulane's backfield stars:"His results speak for themselves. He has been a vital factor in the development of such backfield stars as Nollie Felts, Francis Payne, Red Dawson, Wop Glover, Johnny McDaniel, Joe Loftin and a dozen others. His boxing teams for five years have either won the Southern championship or been runner-up. They are defending champions again this year.... Bernie Bierman and Ted Cox both declare that Bank could do more to make a varsity player out of a scrub or freshman in a short space of time than anyone they had ever seen. ... His <b>value</b> <b>for</b> scouting <b>duty</b> has been vital, too. He is the chief scout for Coach Cox {{and one of the best}} in the business." ...|$|R
40|$|Photovoltaic {{generators}} (PVG) {{are increasingly}} {{used to provide}} electricity in remote areas. However, in many applications the DC generated electricity by a PVG need to be converted to AC. Traditionally DC to AC inverters {{have been widely used}} for this purpose. In this paper, a different system is proposed in which a self excited induction generator (SEIG) driven by a permanent magnet DC motor (DCM) and powered from a PVG through a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) are used. A step-up chopper is utilized as an MPPT unit. The proposed system is modelled in time domain, and a detailed transient and steady-state analysis are presented. The main reason behind analyzing the system in the time domain is {{because of the fact that}} for unknown speeds, the methods developed for steady-state analysis of SEIGs can not be applied. The presented work shows that the full available power of the PVG can be harnessed by selecting suitable <b>values</b> <b>for</b> the <b>duty</b> cycle and the frequency of the step up chopper and the excitation capacitor of the SEIG. It is also shown that with such a combination power utilization efficiency of more than 83 % can be achieved...|$|R
