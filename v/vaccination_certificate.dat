The immunization rate with three doses of diphtheria, tetanus and poliomyelitis vaccines was 99. 4 %, and that of the pertussis vaccine was 93. 3 %. With the vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella the rates were 80. 3 %, 78. 1 % and 77. 5 % respectively. Vaccination rate against Haemophilus influenzae type B was 74. 7 % with two doses, and 61. 2 % with three doses. The timing and the number of doses of the vaccines used for infants in the Canton of Zurich were satisfactory. However, the vaccination rate for measles, mumps and rubella is inadequate.

50|$|In June 2016, a WHO {{representative}} in Luanda {{said that the}} initial investigation of the outbreak in December was thrown off course because the first cases in December 2015—the sick Eritrean visitors—had what were later identified as fake yellow fever <b>vaccination</b> <b>certificates.</b> All {{had been to the}} same restaurant, so food poisoning was initially suspected as the cause of the mystery illness. It was more than a month before blood samples from the Eritreans reached the Pasteur Institute lab and yellow fever was recognized. Public health experts identified that as one factor that delayed the response to the outbreak, which came close to being a much larger disaster, if vaccine supplies had not been successfully raised in time, or the disease had spread to other countries and continents. The concurrent Zika outbreak drew attention away from a potentially far more serious epidemic of yellow fever.|$|R
5000|$|In France, the High Council of Public Health is {{in charge}} of proposing vaccine {{recommendations}} to the Minister of Health. Each year, immunization recommendations for both the general population and specific groups are published by the Institute of Epidemiology and Surveillance. Since some hospitals are granted additional freedoms, there two key people responsible for vaccine policy within hospitals: the Operational physician (OP), and the Head of the hospital infection and prevention committee (HIPC). Mandatory immunization policies on BCG, diphtheria, tetanus, and poliomyelitis began in the 1950s and policies on Hepatitis B began in 1991. Recommended but not mandatory suggestions on influenza, pertussis, varicella, and measles began in 2000, 2004, 2004, and 2005, respectively. According to the 2013 INPES Peretti-Watel health barometer, between 2005 and 2010, the percentage of French people between 18-75 years old in favor of vaccination dropped from 90% to 60%. Conversely, those who claimed to be anti-vaccination increased from 8.5% in 2005 to 38.2% in 2010. Since 2009, France has recommended meningococcus C vaccination for infants 1-2 years old, with a catch up dosage up to 25 years later. French insurance companies have reimbursed this vaccine since January 2010, at which point coverage levels were 32.3% for children 1-2 years and 21.3% for teenagers 14-16 years old. [...] In 2012, the French government and the Institut de veille sanitaire launched a 5-year national program in order to improve vaccination policy. The program simplified guidelines, facilitated access to vaccination, and invested in vaccine research. In 2014, fueled by rare health-related scandals, mistrust of vaccines became a common topic in the French public debate on health. According to a French radio station, as of 2014, 3 to 5 percent of kids in France were not given the mandatory vaccines. Some families may avoid requirements by finding a doctor willing to forge a <b>vaccination</b> <b>certificate,</b> a solution which numerous French forums confirm. However, the French State considers [...] "vaccine refusal" [...] a form of child abuse. In some instances, parental vaccine refusals may result in criminal trials. France's 2010 creation of the Question Prioritaire Constitutionelle (QPC) allows lower courts to refer constitutional questions to the highest court in the relevant hierarchy. Therefore, criminal trials based on vaccine refusals may be referred to the Cour de Cassation, which will then certify whether the case meets certain criteria. In May 2015, France updated its vaccination policies on diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenzae b infections, and hepatitis B for premature infants. As of 2015, while failure to vaccinate is not necessarily illegal, a parent's right to refuse to vaccinate his or her child is technically a constitutional matter. Additionally, children in France cannot enter schools without proof of vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, and polio. French Health Minister, Marisol Touraine, finds vaccinations [...] "absolutely fundamental to avoid disease," [...] and has pushed to have both trained pharmacists and doctors administer vaccinations. Most recently, the Prime Minister's 2015-2017 roadmap for the [...] "multi-annual social inclusion and anti-poverty plan" [...] includes free vaccinations in certain public facilities. Vaccinations within the immunization schedule are given for free at immunization services within the public sector. When given in private medical practices, vaccinations are 65% reimbursed.|$|E

40|$|Extract] The {{provision}} of written {{health and safety}} information for travellers has {{become an integral part}} of supporting the advice given during pre-travel health consultations. This may take the form of brochures, information sheets, and printouts from the Internet or indeed travel health booklets such as Travel <b>Vaccination</b> <b>Certificate</b> Book and Pre-Travel Guide, formerly Your Passport to Travel Health. ¹ Travel <b>Vaccination</b> <b>Certificate</b> Book and Pre-Travel Guide is based on the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP),² which has recently superseded the International Certificate of Vaccination (ICV), but has strategically inserted health information for the traveller. Travel <b>Vaccination</b> <b>Certificate</b> Book and Pre-Travel Guide includes notes on travel advice, passports and consular advice, as per the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) ³; notes on yellow fever, a travel health checklist, the ICVP, notes on malaria, notes on how to prevent malaria and dengue fever, notes on rabies, including a detailed rabies pre-exposure and post-exposure vaccination record; a chart giving the duration of protection of vaccines; and a section for detailing important medical history. It is curious that the nomenclature on the cover is not consistent with the ICVP. In addition, there is no obvious date of publication on the booklet and the year of publication has been estimated from discussions with the author. The Travel <b>Vaccination</b> <b>Certificate</b> Book and Pre-Travel Guide is obviously directed to travellers and retains the size of the ICV, hence could be easily carried with other travel documents. It no longer appears to come standard with a durable protective yellow plastic cover, as in the previous edition. None-the-less, it is as robust as any ICV or ICVP. In order to keep the booklet compact, it has omitted the A–Z of travel health issues, which would need to be provided by a separate publication. None-the-less, it may be useful to provide other essential advice for the traveller, such as a ready reference chart reminding travellers of lifesaving first aid procedures and an expanded proformas documenting travellers' medications. The inclusion of a key travel advisory website is a significant advance on the previous edition and appears to be the result of a partnership with DFAT. Perhaps other useful websites could be added, such as that of the Australian Travel Health Advisory Group. ⁴ The Travel <b>Vaccination</b> <b>Certificate</b> Book and Pre-Travel Guide gives coverage to issues not covered in an ICV alone. It is not a substitute for up-to-date pre-travel health advice on a range of health and safety topics important to the traveller or those seeking assistance for potentially life-threatening conditions from a qualified source. The Travel <b>Vaccination</b> <b>Certificate</b> Book and Pre-Travel Guide is not without some competition, which may be used as adjunctive resources; however, there are few comparable compact publications. 5 The booklet does provide an exceptionally practical low-cost reference for the traveller as an adjunct to appropriate health advice received before travel...|$|E

The dogs which consisted of 850 males and 628 females were presented at the Small Animal and Preventive Veterinary Medicine Clinics, Veterinary Teaching Hospital, University of Ibadan between January 1993 and December 2002. Among the registered dogs, 155 (10. 5 %) with annual mean of 9. 1 + 9. 1 % were vaccinated. Although more females (83 or 13. 2 %) were vaccinated than male dogs (72 or 8. 5 %), {{the difference was not}} significant (p> 0. 05). Most vaccinated dogs (121 or 78. 1 %), were at the initial vaccination age of 3 months and had the highest vaccination coverage (51 dogs (males and females) or 44. 3 %) while 53 (males and females) dogs (43. 8 %) were adequately vaccinated. Also, 12 (35. 3 %) among 34 dogs with booster vaccination were adequately protected against rabies. The current study showed increase in registration of dogs and the cost of vaccination in the clinics. However declined vaccination and booster coverages were observed compared to the previous 5 – year observations of 36. 5 % vaccination and 59. 5 % booster coverages. These observations were far below the recommendation of WHO (1989, 1990, 2001) to prevent urban rabies epizootics and epidemics in the area.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To assess {{vaccination}} coverage for adults living in Switzerland. METHODS Through a media campaign, {{the general population}} was invited during 1 month to bring their <b>vaccination</b> <b>certificates</b> to the pharmacies to have their immunisation status evaluated with the software viavac©, and to complete a questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 496 pharmacies in Switzerland participated in the campaign, of which 284 (57 %) submitted valid vaccination information. From a total of 3, 634 participants in the campaign, there were 3, 291 valid cases (participants born ≤ 1992) and 1, 011 questionnaires completed. Vaccination coverage for the participants was 45. 9 % and 34. 6 % for five and six doses of diphtheria, 56. 4 % and 44. 0 % for tetanus and 66. 3 % and 48. 0 % for polio, respectively. Coverage estimates for one and two doses of measles vaccine were 76. 5 % and 49. 4 %, respectively, for the birth cohort 1967 - 1992 and 4. 0 % and 0. 8 %, respectively, for the cohort ≤ 1966. There {{was a significant difference}} in coverage for most vaccinations between the two aforementioned birth cohorts. A plot of the measles vaccine coverage over time shows that the increase in coverage correlated with policy changes in the Swiss Immunisation Schedule. CONCLUSIONS Despite selection bias and low participation, this study indicates that {{vaccination coverage}} for the basic recommended immunisations in the adult population in Switzerland is suboptimal. More efforts using various means and methods are needed to increase immunisation coverage in adolescents before they leave school. An established method to determine vaccination coverage for the general population could provide invaluable insights into the effects of changes in vaccination policies and disease outbreaks...|$|R
