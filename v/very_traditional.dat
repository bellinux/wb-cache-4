The Emperor loved his daughter Isabel, but he considered {{the idea of a}} female successor as antithetical to the role required of Brazil's ruler. He viewed the death of his two sons as being a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted. Resistance to accepting a female ruler was also shared by the political establishment. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still <b>very</b> <b>traditional,</b> and only a male successor was thought capable as head of state.|$|E

Some unusual old patterns such as diamonds are now rare everywhere.|$|E

Spaniards brought many new ingredients to the country from other lands, especially spices and domestic animals. And later in the 19th century, the African flavor lent its presence with influence from other Caribbean mixed flavors. This is how Costa Rican cuisine today is very varied, with every new ethnic group who had recently become part of the country's population influencing the country's cuisine.|$|E

25|$|Russia is {{also home}} of a {{particular}} category of minority peoples, i.e. small indigenous peoples of the North and Far East, who maintain <b>very</b> <b>traditional</b> lifestyles, often in a hazardous climatic environment, while adapting to the modern world.

Gil-Robles has noted agreements between indigenous representatives and oil companies, which are to compensate potential damages on peoples habitats due to oil exploration. As Committee of Ministers of Council of Europe noted in 2007, despite some initiatives for development, the social and economic situation of numerically small indigenous peoples was affected by recent legislative amendments at the federal level, removing some positive measures as regards their access to land and other natural resources.|$|E
25|$|However, change loomed on the horizon. From 1881 to 1924, over 2,400,000 {{immigrants}} from Eastern Europe drastically altered American Jewry, increasing it tenfold. The 40,000 members of Reform congregations became {{a small minority}} overnight. The newcomers arrived from backward regions, where modern education was scarce and civil equality nonexistent, retaining {{a strong sense of}} Jewish ethnicity. Even the ideological secularists among them, and more so the many who were or became lax or nonobservant, had a <b>very</b> <b>traditional</b> understanding of worship and religious conduct. The leading intellectuals of Eastern European Jewish nationalism castigated Western Jews in general and Reform in particular not on theological grounds, which they as laicists wholly rejected, but for what they claimed to be assimilationist tendencies and the undermining of peoplehood. This sentiment also fueled the often cool manner in which the denomination is perceived in Israeli society.|$|E
