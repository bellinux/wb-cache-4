2500|$|In {{addition}} to the negative sentiments towards returned soldiers from some sections of the anti-war movement, some Second World War veterans also held negative views and attitudes toward the <b>Vietnam</b> War <b>veterans.</b> As a result, many Australian <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veterans</b> were excluded from joining the Returned Servicemen's League (RSL) during the 1960s and 1970s {{on the grounds that}} the <b>Vietnam</b> War <b>veterans</b> did not fight a [...] "real war". The response of the RSL varied across the country, and while some rejected <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veterans,</b> other branches, particularly those in rural areas, were said to be very supportive. Nevertheless, many <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veterans</b> were excluded from marching in Anzac Day parades during the 1970s because some soldiers of earlier wars saw the <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veterans</b> as unworthy heirs to the ANZAC title and tradition, a view which hurt many <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veterans</b> and resulted in continued resentment towards the RSL. Regardless, in 1972 the RSL decided that <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veterans</b> should lead the march, which attracted large crowds throughout the country.|$|R

5|$|TCDD was {{classified}} in 1997 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a carcinogen for humans (group 1). In the occupational cohort studies {{available for the}} classification, the risk, even at very high exposures, was weak and borderline detectable. Therefore, human data were not deemed sufficient, and the classification was, in essence, based on animal experiments and mechanistic considerations. This has been criticized as a deviation from IARC classification rules. It is much debated whether TCDD is carcinogenic only at high doses which also cause toxic damage of tissues. Moreover, a recent review concludes that, after 1997, further studies do not support an association between TCDD exposure and cancer risk. New studies include the update of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veteran</b> studies from Ranch Hand operation, which concluded that after 30 years the results do not provide evidence of disease.|$|E
