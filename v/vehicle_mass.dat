2500|$|Volkswagen {{partnered with}} Daimler AG and other {{companies}} to market the BlueTec clean diesel technology on cars and trucks from Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, {{and other companies}} and brands. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, four of the ten most fuel-efficient vehicles available {{for sale in the}} U.S. are powered by Volkswagen diesel engines. Volkswagen has offered a number of its vehicles with a TDI (Turbocharged Direct Injection) engine, which lends class-leading fuel economy to several models. They were a three-way tie for 8th (TDI Beetle, TDI Golf, TDI Jetta) and ninth, the TDI Jetta Wagon. In addition, all Volkswagen TDI diesel engines produced from 1996 to 2006 can be driven on 100% biodiesel fuel. [...] For the 2007 model year, however, strict U.S. government emissions regulations have forced VW to drop most diesels from their U.S. engine lineup, but a new lineup of diesel engines compatible to U.S. standards returned to the American market starting with Model Year 2009. These post-2009 Clean Diesel engines are limited to running on 5% (B5) biodiesel only to maintain Volkswagen's warranty. Volkswagen long resisted adding a SUV to its lineup, but relented with the introduction of the Touareg, made in partnership with Porsche, while they worked on the Porsche Cayenne and later the Audi Q7. Though acclaimed as a fine handling vehicle, the Touareg has been a modest seller at best, and it has been criticised by auto reviewers for its absence of a third-row seat, the relatively poor fuel economy, and the high <b>vehicle</b> <b>mass.</b> VW set plans to add a compact SUV with styling influences from the [...] "Concept A" [...] concept vehicle introduced at the 2006 Geneva Auto Show, and on 20 July 2006, VW announced that the new vehicle, called the Tiguan.|$|E

50|$|In {{aerospace}} engineering, the propellant {{mass fraction}} is {{the portion of}} a <b>vehicle's</b> <b>mass</b> which does not reach the destination, usually used {{as a measure of}} the vehicle's performance. In other words, the propellant mass fraction is the ratio between the propellant mass and the initial <b>mass</b> of the <b>vehicle.</b> In a spacecraft, the destination is usually an orbit, while for aircraft it is their landing location. A higher mass fraction represents less weight in a design. Another related measure is the payload fraction, which is the fraction of initial weight that is payload.|$|R
50|$|Roll rate is {{analogous}} to a vehicle's ride rate, but for actions that include lateral accelerations, causing a <b>vehicle's</b> sprung <b>mass</b> to roll about its roll axis. It is expressed as torque per degree of roll of the <b>vehicle</b> sprung <b>mass.</b> It is influenced by factors including {{but not limited to}} <b>vehicle</b> sprung <b>mass,</b> track width, CG height, spring and damper rates, roll center heights of front and rear, anti-roll bar stiffness and tire pressure/construction. The roll rate of a vehicle can, and usually does, differ front to rear, which allows for the tuning ability of a vehicle for transient and steady state handling. The roll rate of a vehicle does not change the total amount of weight transfer on the vehicle, but shifts the speed at which and percentage of weight transferred on a particular axle to another axle through the vehicle chassis. Generally, the higher the roll rate on an axle of a vehicle, the faster and higher percentage the weight transfer on that axle.|$|R
