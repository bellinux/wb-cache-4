5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Korean War, {{a number}} of {{aircraft}} companies in both Europe and America separately decided to investigate the prospective of <b>vertical</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> (VTOL) aircraft, which would eliminate the requirement for vulnerable runways by taking off and landing vertically as opposed to the conventional horizontal approach. In addition to military applications, the prospect of applying such technology to commercial airliners was also viewed with considerable interest by the mid 1950s, thus the value of developing viable vertical take-off systems was judged to be substantial. However, even during this era, few companies had envisioned that a VTOL aircraft would also be realistically compatible with the characteristics of high performance military aircraft.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) was keen {{to develop a}} new {{generation}} of combat aircraft that would be capable of supersonic speeds. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to revive the program, the in-development Hawker P.1121 fighter would ultimately be left unfinished, principally {{due to a lack of}} a political support for development following the release of the 1957 Defence White Paper by Minister of Defence Duncan Sandys. Recognising the need to promptly commence work on another development program, HSA's chief aircraft designer Sir Sydney Camm, who had been in regular discussions with Sir Stanley Hooker of Bristol Aero Engines, decided that the company should investigate the prospects of developing and manufacturing a viable combat-capable <b>vertical</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> (VTOL) fighter aircraft.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to helicopter development, many approaches {{have been tried}} to develop practical aircraft with <b>vertical</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> capabilities including Henry Berliner's 1922–1925 experimental horizontal rotor fixed wing aircraft, and Nikola Tesla's 1928 patent and George Lehberger's 1930 patent for relatively impractical VTOL fixed wing airplanes with a tilting engines. In the late 1930s British aircraft designer Leslie Everett Baynes was issued a patent for the Baynes Heliplane, another tilt rotor aircraft. In 1941 German designer Heinrich Focke's began work on the Focke-Achgelis Fa 269, which had two rotors that tilted downward for vertical takeoff, but wartime bombing halted development.|$|E
25|$|Spinner is a {{nickname}} {{given for the}} type of flying car featured throughout the Blade Runner universe; they are seen in Blade Runner and Blade Runner 2049. They can drive on the ground as a normal car, take off vertically, cruise and hover. Spinners use an unspecified form of jet propulsion, similar to <b>Vertical</b> <b>Take-Off</b> <b>and</b> <b>Landing</b> aircraft. In Blade Runner, they are used extensively by the LAPD to survey the general population, as well as by wealthy entrepreneurs. The Spinner was designed by Syd Mead. The Spinner has been replicated in films such as Back to the Future Part II, The Fifth Element and the Star Wars prequel trilogy.|$|E
25|$|The Mirage F1 {{emerged from}} a series of design studies {{performed}} by French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation. Having originally sought to develop a larger swept wing derivative of the Mirage III, which became the Mirage F2, to serve as a <b>vertical</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> (VTOL) propulsion testbed akin to the Dassault Mirage IIIV, however, it was soon recognised that the emerging design could function as the basis for a competent fighter as well. Both the Mirage F2 and a smaller derivative, referred to the Mirage F3, received substantial attention from both Dassault and the French Air Force, the latter being interested in its adoption as a long-range fighter bomber as a stopgap measure prior to the adoption of the envisioned Anglo-French Variable Geometry (AFVG) strike aircraft.|$|E

500|$|... "Spinner" [...] is {{the generic}} {{term for the}} fictional flying cars used in the film. A spinner can be driven as a {{ground-based}} vehicle, and take off vertically, hover, and cruise using jet propulsion much like <b>vertical</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> (VTOL) aircraft. They are used extensively by the police to patrol and survey the population, {{and it is clear}} that despite restrictions wealthy people can acquire spinner licenses. The vehicle was conceived and designed by Syd Mead who described the spinner as an [...] "aerodyne"—a vehicle which directs air downward to create lift, though press kits for the film stated that the spinner was propelled by three engines: [...] "conventional internal combustion, jet, and anti-gravity" [...] Mead's conceptual drawings were transformed into 25 working vehicles by automobile customizer Gene Winfield. A spinner is on permanent exhibit at the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame in Seattle, Washington.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>vertical</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> (VTOL) {{aircraft}} is {{one that}} can hover, take off, and land vertically. This classification can include a variety of types of aircraft including fixed-wing aircraft [...] as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors, such as cyclogyros/cyclocopters and tiltrotors. Some VTOL aircraft can operate in other modes as well, such as CTOL (conventional take-off and landing), STOL (short take-off and landing), and/or STOVL (short take-off and vertical landing). Others, such as some helicopters, can only operate by VTOL, due to the aircraft lacking landing gear that can handle horizontal motion. VTOL is a subset of V/STOL (vertical and/or short take-off and landing).|$|E
2500|$|Design {{reports from}} early 1952 {{outlined}} key {{features of a}} new gas turbine propelled engine and disc-shaped vehicle: [...] an inner disc with central eye intake with an outer, counter-rotating disc, with rear-directed thrust nozzles, later refined [...] to include controlling the aeroplane by thrust vectoring and stabilizing the vehicle by having the large engine rotor act as a gyroscope. The aircraft was designed for <b>vertical</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> which {{was thought to be}} hazardous and required an electronic flight-stabilization system, then not-yet available. [...] Financed largely by Avro, the Canadian government deemed these problems too expensive to finance beyond an initial funding of $400,000. [...] A USAF-led delegation to Avro in December 1953 gave Avro the opportunity to discuss their projects, but Y-1 was not deemed worthy of financing.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1963, the Hawker P.1127 VTOL (<b>vertical</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing)</b> {{aircraft}} {{had landed}} and taken-off from the carrier [...] {{and the subsequent}} Hawker-Siddeley Kestrel had undergone trials from the [...] "Commando carrier" [...] (an aircraft carrier operating helicopters) [...] It was therefore perfectly possible that the new [...] "cruisers" [...] {{could be used to}} operate VTOL aircraft. The new ships were called [...] "through-deck cruisers" [...] and not [...] "aircraft carrier". This was in part because CVA-01's cancellation was so recent, but also because the ships were intended to serve in traditional cruiser roles of C3I and anti-submarine warfare, and were constructed like cruisers. The [...] "aircraft carrier" [...] name did not officially appear in association with the ships until the 1980 Defence Estimates referred to the Invincibles as such.|$|E
500|$|The Hawker P.1127 and the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel FGA.1 are the {{experimental}} and development aircraft {{that led to}} the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, the first <b>vertical</b> and/or short <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> (V/STOL) jet fighter-bomber. P.1127 development began in 1957, taking advantage of the Bristol Engine Company's choice to invest {{in the creation of the}} Pegasus vectored-thrust engine. Testing began in July 1960 and by the end of the year the aircraft had achieved both <b>vertical</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> horizontal flight.

25|$|During the 1950s {{there were}} many {{attempts}} to design aircraft that could fly conventionally after a <b>vertical</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> then <b>land</b> vertically. As the thrust-to-weight ratio of turbojet engines increased sufficiently for a single engine be able to lift an aircraft, designers began to investigate ways of maintaining stability. Beginning in 1956, the French engine manufacturer SNECMA built a series of wingless test rigs called the Atar Volant, as precursors to a winged aircraft. Only {{the first of these}} was unpiloted and the second flew freely, both stabilized by gas jets on outrigger pipes. The third had a tilting seat to allow the pilot to sit upright when the fuselage was level and had the lateral air intakes planned for the free flying aircraft, though it always operated attached to a movable cradle. The pilot for these experiments was Auguste Morel.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} two robust {{controllers}} for a multivariable <b>vertical</b> short <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> (VSTOL) aircraft system are designed and compared. The aim of these controllers {{is to achieve}} robust stability margins and good performance in step response of the system. LQG/LTR method is a systematic design approach based on shaping and recovering open-loop singular values while mixed-sensitivity H-infinity method is established by defining appropriate weighting functions to achieve good performance and robustness. Comparison of the two controllers show that LQG method requires rate feedback to increase damping of closed-loop system, while H-infinity controller by only proper choose the weighting functions, meets the same performance for step response. Output robustness of both controllers is good but H-infinity controller has poor input stability margin. The net controller order of H-infinity {{is higher than the}} LQG/LTR method and the control effort of them is in the acceptable range. (c) 2006 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: The jump landing is {{the leading}} cause for ankle {{injuries}} in basketball. It has been shown that the use of ankle brace is effective to prevent these injuries by increasing the mechanical stability of the ankle at the initial contact of the foot with the ground. Objective: To investigate the effects of ankle brace on the ground reaction force (GRF) during the simulation of a basketball rebound jump. Method: Eleven young male basketball players randomly carried out a simulated basketball rebound jump under two conditions, with and without ankle brace (lace-up). Dynamic parameters of <b>vertical</b> GRF (<b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> <b>vertical</b> peaks, time to <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> <b>vertical</b> peaks, <b>take-off</b> impulse peak, impulse at 50 milliseconds of <b>landing,</b> <b>and</b> jump height) <b>and</b> medial-lateral (<b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> medial-lateral peaks, <b>and</b> time to reach medial-lateral peaks at <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing)</b> were recorded by force platform during rebound jumps in each tested condition. The comparisons between the tested conditions were performed by paired t test (P 0. 05). Conclusion: The use of ankle brace during basketball rebound jumps attenuates the magnitude of medial-lateral GRF on the landing phase, without changing the vertical GRF. This finding indicates that the use of brace increases the medial-lateral mechanical protection by decreasing the shear force exerted on the athlete’s body without change the application of propulsive forces in the <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> the impact absorption quality in the landing during the basketball rebound jump...|$|R
50|$|If the {{aircraft}} are VTOL-capable or helicopters, {{they do not}} need to decelerate and hence there is no such need. The arrested-recovery system has used an angled deck since the 1950s because, in case {{the aircraft}} does not catch the arresting wire, the short deck allows easier take off by reducing the number of objects between the aircraft {{and the end of the}} runway. It also has the advantage of separating the recovery operation area from the launch area. Helicopters and aircraft capable of <b>vertical</b> or short <b>take-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> (V/STOL) usually recover by coming abreast the carrier on the port side and then using their hover capability to move over the flight deck <b>and</b> <b>land</b> vertically without the need for arresting gear.|$|R
