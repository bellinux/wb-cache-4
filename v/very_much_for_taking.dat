40|$|The {{eruption}} of Merapi Mountain Yogyakarta in 2010 caused the damage of water-installation tool in Belang hamlet, Tlogolele village, Selo district, Boyolali county, Central Java. It caused {{the people in}} Belang hamlet difficult to gain clean water. The people had to walk far away to gain clean water for their sanitation and drinks, so a tool was needed <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> the clean water. Hydrant pump is simple to make and maintain. It can last for a long time. Fuel, lubricant, and electricity are not needed. We conducted this community service program for eight months, from April 2013 to November 2013 in Belang, Tlogolele, Selo, Boyolali. The purposes of making this hydrant pump are to overcome water shortages and to improve the welfare of society. The hydrant pump needed a water-resource reservoir to help the pressure which is needed by hydrant pump. This pressure {{will be used as}} dynamic pressure to lift water up from low place to higher place. In this program, we conducted some stages that is observation, socialization, pump manufacturing, pump installation, pump testing, pump utilization, pump developing, and pump maintenance. This hydrant pump program uses a hydrant pump with dimension of 4 inch which able to raise 80 -meter-high water in 500 -meter distance. The cost which was used for this program is Rp 11. 330. 000, 00. Rp. 10. 500. 000, 00 from DIKTI and Rp. 830. 000, 00 from the people of Belang. The innovation of using hydrant pump without foil becomes solution to handle water shortages in Belang. This program is put to good use by the people for gaining clean water. This program also successfully encourages people to solve water shortages in Belang. Furthermore, the result of this program is that the people start learning about hydrant pump so that the community can utilize this technology for agriculture and animal husbandry.

40|$|Urban {{farming and}} food Cue: Urban {{agriculture}} - the {{growing of crops}} and keeping of livestock in cities ? is increasingly popular {{in many parts of}} Africa, both as a means for generating income, and as a way for urban households to supplement their diets. However, one challenge facing urban farming is how to access water for irrigation. While some families may harvest rainwater from their rooftops, many urban farmers depend on less clean sources of water, including polluted rivers and drainage channels. This creates a danger to health, both for the farmers themselves, who risk catching infections from the water, and for consumers who buy their produce. So how can consumers protect themselves, {{and what can be done}} to ensure that produce grown in urban areas is as safe as possible? To find out, Eric Kadenge went to a restaurant owned by food safety expert Mr Ham Onsando. Apart from his restaurant business, Mr Onsando also works for Global Food Safety, an organisation which helps restaurants and food processors to improve their safety standards. He began by explaining the risk to food safety from the use of contaminated irrigation water. IN:		?There is a very interesting situation ? OUT:		? Thank you very much. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 35 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr Ham Onsando, of the organisation Global Food Safety, talking to Eric Kadenge. Transcript Onsando	There is a very interesting situation that we find ourselves, especially in Nairobi and the urban setting. You have got your domestic shambas (gardens), you have got people who grow food by riversides, by drainage systems. A lot of these obviously have an element of risk. More so when we know that a lot of the effluent that leaves our houses finds its way into these rivers, into the drainage system on the way out. If you go into the industrial area, a lot of organizations there are pumping chemicals into these same scenarios that then end up possibly contaminating the produce that we get from these farmers. Kadenge	It is actually quite scary especially during the days when it?s very rainy because you will find that the sewage water and all the other rain water gets mixed up. Onsando	I have got a classic example of one. On my way home I always drive by him, he?s got a little sukuma wiki (kales) patch, and I know he gets his water from the drainage that runs by the little patch. There are issues in terms of what contaminants he is actually transferring on to the produce. The produce looks good, but you have then got to be aware of ? because of where it is grown - there is a risk and because of that risk there are ways you have got to address it. So you have got to cook it thoroughly, make sure you wash it thoroughly etc. So the steps to actually secure your own safety in terms of the consumer are easy to achieve. It is just washing thoroughly and then cooking thoroughly. That would normally get rid of the kind of contaminants we are dealing with in the urban area. But in that backdrop as well, we have got a mushrooming up of more informal eating areas as well. Nowadays you walk down the street and you can buy fruit salad ready to eat. You don?t know where the fruits have been washed, you don?t know whether the guy washed his hands before peeling the fruit, before chopping; we know so little about the food we are eating. Kadenge	And how do you think then that some of these risks could be minimized or prevented especially from the farmer?s perspective? Onsando	One of the biggest things we need is legislation. Legislation in the sense that farmers who draw water from rivers or from bore-holes have a right to know what kind of pollutants could have gotten into that water. Now legislation on industries, big industry players, we need legislation that will control what they can spew out into rivers. We need legislation that controls what pesticides farmers can use and in what quantities. Kadenge	Let?s talk about the consumer. How should I as a consumer get to know about these risks? Onsando	Education on food risks when you are eating is very key. But from my perspective any time you eat in a restaurant ? even if you have the slightest discomfort, four hours, three hours after eating, complain. Go back to that restaurant and complain. Say they caused you to have a sleepless night, they caused you to have diarrhea ? complain. Consumers have to be aware of their rights and I think the media has a role to play in that and maybe we should be running more consumer awareness programs and inviting people to tell the consumer what is his right as a consumer. Kadenge	And lastly then, what word would you have in regards to the contamination of water that is used for irrigation in urban settings like Nairobi? Onsando	Other than touting a lot for legislation, I would also like to ask the industry players, the guys who are actually spewing out a lot of waste water into our ecosystem. They should actually take it upon themselves and they should ask themselves ?Is what I am doing good for the environment?? Because ultimately, they might think that they will drive home in their big cars and go into their posh neighbourhoods and it will not affect them. But ultimately whatever we do to the environment affects us. Nature has got a nasty way of coming right round back and hitting at us. Kadenge	Okay thank you <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> your time to talk to us. Is this my cup of tea? Onsando	Yes, enjoy your cup of tea, it is very safe - purified water! Kadenge	Thank you very much. End of track.

40|$|Horticultural crops {{for export}} Cue: Kenya {{is well known}} as one of the major African {{suppliers}} of fruit, vegetables and flowers to European markets. In January this year, a group of European buyers, including some of the big supermarkets, introduced a new set of standards for horticultural produce. Called Eurepgap, the standards require all suppliers to grow their produce in accordance with strict rules - and to be able to prove that they have done so. Failure to meet the standards could mean that a buyer will refuse to accept the produce, potentially a big loss of income for the farmer. So growing for export markets remains a challenging business, not least for small-scale farmers. To find out how farmers are coping, and to learn about the support offered by the agricultural extension services in Kenya, Eric Kadenge recently visited two farms close to Nairobi. He also spoke to an extension officer who has been helping both farmers with their production and their marketing. IN:		?My name is Bernard Ngoi? OUT:		? alongside their food crops. ? DUR?N		 7 ? 55 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Sarah Ndegwa concluding that while growing horticultural crops for export is a demanding activity, it can also be financially rewarding. Transcript Ngoi:	My name is Bernard Ngoi. I plant French beans, baby corns and maize for eating. Kadenge:	Do you also plant the French beans for eating? Ngoi:	No I plant French beans for selling. Kadenge:	Right now we are in your farm and I can see that you are busy as well as your colleagues here. What is happening, what are you doing? Ngoi:	Now we are preparing to plant some French beans. Kadenge:	Why did you decide to grow French beans for sale? Ngoi:	It is the crop for which I can get money easily, because we use one and a half months to get money. Kadenge:	What are some of the biggest challenges you face with this crop? Ngoi:	Sometimes when we have no fertilizers or the money where we can get it, it is difficult for us, because if you plant without fertilizer or manure it cannot do well. Also we use some labourers but we give them 120 /- per half day. Sometimes we use a machine for pumping some water. So sometimes we get loss instead of profit. Kadenge:	Why do you have to use labourers? Ngoi:	It is because if we use cows we cannot prepare well, so as to make the French beans grow well. Kadenge:	And you've mentioned that you also have to use a water pump to pump water. Where do you get this water from? Is it from that river ahead of us? Ngoi:	We get water from this river, you can see. Also we built a gabion here - you can see it. And we were helped by local government. We can use it and plant more and we can get money. Kadenge:	Now the level of the water here is very, very low. Is this what usually happens or are there times when you have a lot of water here that it actually flows like a big river? Ngoi:	Yes, in December, January to May it flows very much, and there is plenty of water here. Kadenge:	Other than the problems of pumping water and the cost of production of French beans, what other difficulties do you face in terms of growing French beans? Ngoi:	Sometimes there is some limit in marketing. And if we plant and it is not carried, we lose some kgs (kilograms). Kadenge:	So they are very perishable. They have to get to the market quickly. And how do you carry them from your farm to the market? Ngoi:	We use wheel-barrows to carry these to our nearest market, so it can be carried by the agent to send it to Machakos or Nairobi. SFX	Car stopping, door closing. Kadenge:	We have just arrived at Mr Katumbo's farm. He grows all kinds of fruits but what you can see most as you enter his farm are the mango trees and as you shall discover he has more than five different varieties of mango trees that he grows here. Katumbo:	I am Peter Mutisya Katumbo. I am a horticultural farmer. I grow a variety of mango fruits, oranges, tangerines, tomatoes and also some paw paws. Kadenge:	Of all the crops that you have mentioned, what do you grow most? Katumbo:	Mangoes. I've got about more than 10 mango varieties. Kadenge:	OK. Let?s move closer to this heap of mangoes here. What are they doing here - why are they heaped here? Katumbo:	We are going to ferry these to Nairobi for marketing. Kadenge:	So why don?t we take a walk to the farm and then continue to discuss a little bit more about your mango farming? SFX	Footsteps. Kadenge:	So we are standing just next to one of the mango trees here that seems to be very, very heavy with fruit. Now this is what variety? Katumbo:	This is called Kent. Kadenge:	Now why did you decide to grow mangoes? Katumbo:	I would say I was looking for a crop which can give good returns. This appears to be the only cash crop that can do well here. Kadenge:	Are there any challenges that you face as you bring up these mango trees? Katumbo:	Yeah there are all sorts of challenges. You find various diseases attacking the crop. Spraying of chemicals is very necessary. The required chemicals, for example fungicides. To export mangoes to Europe has become somewhat a big problem, because now we have newly-introduced conditions by EUREPGAP. Kadenge:	Now what word would you have for somebody that is thinking of growing mangoes? Katumbo:	I would like to tell him that growing mangoes should be taken seriously. It seems as though it is the only viable cash crop in this area. Kadenge:	So thank you <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> us around your farm and we've enjoyed talking about the various fruits especially about mangoes. SFX	Car stopping. Ndegwa:	My name is Sarah Ndegwa, I am a specialist in horticulture, and I am doing extension work for the Machakos district. I give guidance on production and after production we link the farmers to the market. Kadenge:	We have just visited two of the farmers you work with. One was a French bean farmer and the other one is this mango farmer. Let?s start with French beans. What are the conditions necessary for the cultivation of French beans? Ndegwa:	Generally what is required in almost all of the crops is record keeping. Because you need to know: time of planting, time of spraying, and what chemicals you sprayed, the dosage, the quantity, source of seed, for example - where you bought the seed from. So the farmers have to record every step of their activity, and this also helps in the traceability and also the expected time of harvesting. Each crop has its own chemicals. We do give a spray programme for each crop. And the chemicals depend on the time, the stage of the product. Because let?s say you are harvesting: you need to use chemicals that have a short post harvest interval, like one day or two days. The same thing with mangoes. If you are harvesting, at harvesting stage we actually discourage spraying at harvesting stage for mangoes. So most of the chemicals for mangoes you start when they are flowering. Kadenge:	One of the things that the two farmers have mentioned has been accessibility to the market and the exploitation by middlemen. Is this something that you are able to address, as a horticultural development agency? Ndegwa:	We are working very hard on this because we have been helping the farmers on production and they have managed to do good quality produce. We have a list of exporters that we have approached, and local markets also. So we are trying to link them with the farmer. Like this mango farmer; we just brought an exporter to him and he bought his mangoes and he bought even from the farmers around here. He is able to collect from the farm and pay them on the farm. And the same case with the French bean farmers. We are linking them with a buyer. That way the middlemen issue is being tackled; but only for those farmers we are working with. Kadenge:	But since these are high value crops, are you seeing a difference? Do they change the lives of the farmers here, who may not have been making much from the usual subsistence farming of maize and beans? Ndegwa:	Over the four years that I have been in extension work I have seen horticultural farming making a difference in farmers? lives. They are able to pay their school fees and meet other small expenses, because they are doing their horticultural farming as a cash crop alongside their food crops. End of track. Eric Kadenge talks to a French bean farmer and a mango farmer, and the extension worker who has been helping them, for example with record-keeping...|$|E
