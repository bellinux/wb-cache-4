500|$|Investigation {{revealed}} {{a history of}} frequent drinking that resulted in [...] "blinding rage", [...] "bad temper", and quarrels with employers, that had led friends to call him [...] "mental". On 11 March, Ram Singh was discovered hanging from a <b>ventilator</b> <b>shaft</b> in his cell at about 5:45 am. Authorities said {{it was unclear whether}} it was a suicide or a murder.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} I was devising {{another way to}} overcome that deadly <b>ventilator</b> <b>shaft.</b> The scheme was so simple that I was shamed in {{that it had not}} occurred to me at the very beginning. The slitted opening was small. Two sacks of flour, in a wooden frame, suspended by ropes {{from the edge of the}} chart-house roof directly above, would effectually cover the opening and block all revolver fire.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, the Grove Prison Museum {{was opened}} in the former deputy governor's house across from the {{original}} gatehouse of the prison. The entrance is located through the gardens. Within the garden lies one of three Victorian <b>ventilator</b> <b>shafts,</b> once used as a ventilator to a sewer system. All three became Grade II Listed monuments in September 1978.|$|R
50|$|The North Midland Railway tunnel sank nine <b>ventilator</b> <b>shafts</b> {{through which}} smoke wafted across the Peaks. Clay Cross is {{situated}} at the highest point on the line 361 feet above sea level, {{when it opened in}} 1840. A narrow gauge line transported coal up the incline to the works. Another mile north along the 'Black Path' was Clay Cross railway station, between the halts at Tupton and Hepthorne Lane.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} Austin {{had gone}} down to the stoke-hold. The place was dimly lighted, and insufferably hot, for, with the Cumbria stationary, no more air came down the <b>ventilator</b> <b>shafts</b> than the fires would draw, and they were burning sulkily. In fact, it was only by strenuous labour that steam could be raised at all. Here and there the pale flicker of an oil lamp emphasised the gloom, though there were three half-moon patches of brightness {{in each of the}} two boilers, until a fierce red glow beat out as Tom, the donkey-man, flung open a furnace door. Then Austin gained some impression of his surroundings.|$|R
60|$|But first, the ventilator. This is a steel shaft {{that leads}} {{up from the}} coal-carrying bowels of the ship beneath the lazarette and that wins to the outside-world via the after-wall of the chart-house. In fact, it {{occupies}} the hollow inside of the double walls of the afterwall of the chart-house. Its opening, {{at the height of}} a man's head, is screened with iron bars so closely set that no mature-bodied rat can squeeze between. Also, this opening commands the wheel, which is a scant fifteen feet away and directly across the booby-hatch. Some mutineer, crawling along the space between the coal and the deck of the lower hold, had climbed the <b>ventilator</b> <b>shaft</b> and was able to take aim through the slits between the bars.|$|E
60|$|His {{reflections}} were disturbed. A fowl, cackling in wild alarm, {{came down}} the <b>ventilator</b> <b>shaft</b> that pierced the ceiling of his small room. It struck the rack above the folding washstand, and Kit's hairbrush {{and a box of}} brass buttons fell. The buttons rolled about the floor and under his berth. Then the fowl swept his desk with fluttering wings and the inkpot overturned. Kit frowned and put his letter in the envelope. His friends on board liked a rude joke, and a fowl had come down the shaft before. Kit had thought he had spoiled the joke by painting the inside of the bowl-head on deck, but the paint did not long keep wet. He tried to catch the fowl, with the object of putting it in Macallister's bed, and finding he could not, opened the door, and drove it out. Soon afterward Macallister came in and indicated the stained desk.|$|E

50|$|Grove Lime Kiln lies {{approximately}} 320 metres north-west of St Peter's Church, and is Grade II Listed. Still {{owned by}} the prison service, the lime kiln remains in a derelict state. At {{the top of the}} nearby incline road is the abandoned Old Engine Shed that once served the cable-operated inclined railway that ran to Castletown. It is also Grade II Listed Within the village are three Victorian <b>ventilator</b> <b>shafts,</b> once used as ventilators to a sewer system. One lies within the Governor's Community Garden, and the other two shafts are found closer to the cliff edge. All three are Grade II Listed monuments. A War Department/Admiralty boundary marker near the gardens is also Grade II Listed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{garden is}} placed atop the large roof, or dalle, {{that covers the}} tracks and {{platforms}} of the Gare Monparnasse, supported by twelve pillars, and seventeen meters above the street level. Large <b>ventilator</b> <b>shafts</b> for the station are placed around the garden, and {{the announcement of the}} trains departing can be heard in the garden. Cubes of stone filled with earth contain five hundred trees. The garden is surrounded by office buildings and by a line of tennis courts on the west side. It is also the site of a small museum honoring Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, commander of the French armored division which entered Paris first during the liberation of the city from the Germans in August 1944.|$|R
5000|$|A public {{footpath}} in Glenfield passes {{close to}} the western entrance to Glenfield tunnel, , which has been bricked up. The eastern entrance to the tunnel has been buried, while the tunnel {{as a whole was}} sold to Leicester city council for a nominal sum, though the council has never decided what use to make of it. The tops of several brick <b>ventilator</b> <b>shafts</b> can be seen among the houses of the estate above the tunnel, for example beside the A563 at some are in the back gardens of the houses. The tunnel itself underwent in 2008 a retrofit to install strengthening rings that are hoped to prevent a collapse of the extant tunnel shaft. The £500,000 reinforcement project was commissioned by the Leicester city council and was recorded by the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust and photographed by the Leicestershire Industrial History Society. Occasional [...] "open days" [...] are held for organised groups.From the centre of Glenfield, , the trackbed has been converted to a public footpath to Ratby, , where there is a commemorative plaque next to a short length of rail.|$|R

50|$|Baritz {{remained}} {{loyal to}} the SPGB, at times as its only member in Manchester, and he became known for heckling at meetings of rival socialist groups. In particular, on one occasion when he was banned from entering {{a meeting of the}} Social Democratic Federation, he climbed on the roof and blew a clarinet down the <b>ventilator</b> <b>shaft,</b> ensuring that the meeting could not continue until he was eventually permitted to take a seat inside.|$|E
5000|$|Ram Singh was {{presented}} before the Metropolitan Magistrate on 18 December 2012. He {{refused to participate}} in an identification process.Investigation revealed a history of frequent drinking that resulted in [...] "blinding rage", [...] "bad temper", and quarrels with employers, that had led friends to call him [...] "mental". On 11 March, Ram Singh was discovered hanging from a <b>ventilator</b> <b>shaft</b> in his cell at about 5:45 am. Authorities said it was unclear whether it was a suicide or a murder.|$|E
50|$|This was {{his first}} public commission, and was a major {{breakthrough}} for Le Corbusier. He gave the building {{the name of his}} pre-war theoretical project, the Cité Radieuse, and followed the principles that he had studied before the war, he proposed a giant reinforced concrete framework, into which modular apartments would be fit like bottles into a bottle rack. Like the Villa Savoye, the structure was poised on concrete pylons though, because of the shortage of steel to reinforce the concrete, the pylons were more massive than usual. The building contained 337 duplex apartment modules to house a total of 1,600 persons. Each module was three stories high, and contained two apartments, combined so each had two levels (see diagram above). The modules ran {{from one side of the}} building to the other, and each apartment had a small terrace at each end. They were ingeniously fitted together like pieces of a Chinese puzzle, with a corridor slotted through the space between the two apartments in each module. Residents had a choice of twenty-three different configurations for the units. Le Corbusier designed furniture, carpets and lamps to go with the building, all purely functional; the only decoration was a choice of interior colors that Le Corbusier gave to residents. The only mildly decorative features of the building were the <b>ventilator</b> <b>shafts</b> on the roof, which Le Corbusier made to look like the smokestacks of an ocean liner, a functional form that he admired.|$|R
5000|$|According to the 1840 review {{another picture}} [...] "the grand <b>ventilator</b> <b>shaft</b> conveys an equally {{good idea of}} the {{appearance}} of this vast passage diminishing in the distance into a mere speck. A very picturesque plate of the viaduct over the river Blythe, near the termination of the railroad, has the singular merit of displaying {{on opposite sides of}} the same view, a comparison between the ancient and modern modes of bridge building. The massive piers, further secured by buttresses and narrow arches of the ancient fort bridge, afford a curious contrast to the great altitude and extensive span with the slender supports of the modern viaduct." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{end of the}} fort's active service came at 5 a.m. on 6 July 1900 {{when the}} No. 3 {{magazine}} which held 3 tons (3 tonnes) of gunpowder exploded. An inquiry found that Gunner Haines had fired a ball cartridge down a <b>ventilator</b> <b>shaft</b> causing the explosion, after being put on a charge for returning late to barracks, however this explanation has been challenged. The wall separating the fort from the moat on the south west corner was demolished and wreckage thrown up to 200 yd. No one knew why the gunner had blown up the fort, {{but it has been}} speculated that {{it was an act of}} suicide. The cannons were hauled away by traction engines.|$|E
5000|$|Religious devotion. The {{number of}} {{individual}} family and [...] "great" [...] kivas, ceremonial objects, and elaborate altars {{are indicative of}} a rich and dedicated spiritual life. Kivas, generally men's domain, were used for religious rituals, social activity and weaving. They were generally constructed {{below the surface of}} the ground with: a fire pit, overhead entry, spirit entrance or Sipapu, banquette seating and a <b>ventilator</b> <b>shaft.</b> Sometimes adjacent kivas were connected by tunnels. [...] "Great" [...] kivas were constructed for larger community activities. Painted images of men, plants, animals and designs were painted in some kivas, such as the Fire Temple at Mesa Verde. The Fire Temple designs are similar to the ceremonial rooms of the modern Hopi people, specifically the [...] "New Fire" [...] rituals.|$|E
50|$|Brean Down Fort {{was one of}} {{a number}} of Palmerston Forts built to defend the British, Irish and Channel Island coastlines. It was {{originally}} built in stages between 1862 and 1870; to protect the Bristol Channel. It had a large, underground, main gunpowder magazine, 15 foot (4.5 m) by 18 foot (5.5 m) by 20 foot (6.1 m) high, built to the recommendations of the 1863 Royal Commission. The magazine still exists. A further two, smaller, underground magazines, No. 2 magazine and No. 3 magazine, were also built. No. 3 magazine exploded on 3 July 1900 destroying most of the barracks. Gunner Hains was killed. It was concluded that he had killed himself by firing a ball cartridge down a <b>ventilator</b> <b>shaft</b> into the magazine which held 3 tons (3 tonnes) of gunpowder, causing the magazine to explode. The fort was reused in both the First and Second World Wars; and additional expense magazines constructed. The fort is now owned by the National Trust.|$|E
50|$|Stan climbs {{a ladder}} {{to help him}} out, but the ladder topples over with them both on it. Down below, two men see the ladder falling towards them. One falls into some {{whitewash}} while the other hides in a shed, which proves {{to be a bad}} idea when the duo crash onto the shed, demolishing it. As Laurel helps Hardy out of the wreckage, there is a knocking from beneath the door. The man they help out proves to be their foreman, who was the one who sought cover in the shed. They beat a hasty retreat. The foreman would have run after them, but he was crowned by a small barrel that got kicked down the <b>ventilator</b> <b>shaft</b> and out the vent port. Attempting to flee, their car gets sawed in two lengthwise by a large band saw whilst they remain seated in it. The two fall out of the collapsing wreckage. Laurel finds the phonograph still intact and plays a record. Hardy is singularly unimpressed by music now, and chases Laurel.|$|E
5000|$|Gallina {{architecture}} {{was also}} influenced by the Rosa style. Villages ranged from three to twenty dwellings and were generally combinations of surface structures and pit houses with north-south orientation. The pit houses were often dug in the high points of mesas and then completely palisaded. Surface houses often had storage bins that extended off {{the east and west}} side of the house. These houses were generally [...] "unit-type" [...] which has thick walls of unworked stones in mud mortar. The interiors of these houses were smooth and neatly plastered. They also contained fire pits with U-shaped deflectors that directed heat and caught ash. There was generally a <b>ventilator</b> <b>shaft</b> through the wall that followed the north-south orientation of the house. The interior roofs were left as beams and bags were hung from them as a storage method. The surface houses were always rectangular, however, the pit houses could be round or rectangular and tunnels connected pit and surface houses. These houses were moderately transitory as {{there is some evidence that}} the Gallina would leave a dwelling to move short distances, probably to follow the rainfall.|$|E
40|$|The fragmentary {{remains of}} a female aged 45 to 50 years were {{recovered}} from floor fill in the <b>ventilator</b> <b>shaft</b> of a Pueblo I pit house at Sacred Ridge (5 LP 245). Taphonomic evidence indicates facial destruction, scalping, decapitation, dismemberment, and perhaps hand or foot removal. Human hemoglobin and myoglobin residue on associated artifacts suggest that processing took place in this structure. This study addresses {{the significance of this}} feature in regard to the remains of 33 other processed individuals in another pit structure at Sacred Ridge, and the implications of these features for interpretations of Pueblo I pit structure burials...|$|E
40|$|High {{frequency}} {{cyclic load}} {{of fresh air}} supply to ventilator blades in thermo energetic facilities can cause the occurrence of fretting in the pressed overlap of <b>ventilator</b> <b>shaft</b> and socket. These loads can be generated by the resonant oscillations of ventilator blades and thermal residual stress due to welding. To prevent running in resonant conditions, the manufacturer of the ventilator defined a procedure of adjusting blades natural frequency {{in the process of}} production, as well as period control during exploitation period. The numerical simulations and the accelerations measured and presented in this paper, enabling analysis of mass changes and rotation rate effects on resonant oscillations occurrence in fresh air ventilator...|$|E
