Methods In this lung cancer screening trial 3, 080 male participants without a prior cardiovascular event were analysed. Fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events were included. Spirometry included forced expiratory <b>volume</b> <b>measured</b> in <b>units</b> of one-second percent predicted (FEV 1 % predicted) and FEV 1 divided by forced vital capacity (FVC; FEV 1 /FVC). CT examinations were quantified for coronary artery calcium volume, pulmonary emphysema (perc 15) and bronchial wall thickness (pi 10). Data were analysed via a Cox proportional hazard analysis, net reclassification improvement (NRI) and C-indices. Results 184 participants experienced a cardiovascular event during a median follow-up of 2. 9 years. Age, pack-years and smoking status adjusted hazard ratios were 0. 992 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 985 - 0. 999) for FEV 1 % predicted, 1. 000 (95 % CI 0. 986 - 1. 015) for FEV 1 /FVC, 1. 014 (95 % CI 1. 005 - 1. 023) for perc 15 per 10 HU, and 1. 269 (95 % CI 1. 024 - 1. 573) for pi 10 per 1 mm.

[...] The text was printed both in essay form and in book form under the same title along with eight other comparably {{supportive}} essays. In this essay, Rowe presented his original view of the direct comparative reading of modern architecture alongside neo-Classical architecture. This approach was not generally done or accepted in the architectural literature {{of the time when}} the essay was first published in 1976. Rowe asserted the basis of a direct comparison of a villa by Le Corbusier and a villa by Andrea Palladio from the 16th century. Rowe's choice was to place Palladio's masterpiece from the 1550s called the Malcontenta (Villa Foscari) into direct comparison with Le Corbusier's villa at Garches for Mr. and Mrs. Michael Stein. Rowe's argument began by asserting that both Garches and the Malcontenta are conceived of as single blocks of roughly identical <b>volumes</b> <b>measuring</b> [...] "6 <b>units</b> in length, by 5 1/2 in breadth, by 5 in height." [...] Rowe then observes that [...] "Each house exhibits an alternative rhythm of double and single intervals; and each house ... displays a comparable tripartite distribution of line of support."

40|$|International audienceDan {{refers to}} a <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for {{capacity}} and a vessel often encountered {{in the management of}} grain during the Qin and the Western Han dynasties. It was only after Wang Mang that it was in general replaced by the hu. As the highest administrative <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for capacity, in Qin and Western Han times it was used in parallel with tong, the highest legal <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for capacity. The unit for capacity dan takes its origin in the regulation stating that 10 dou of “coarsely husked grain” and one weight unit dan of a cereal plant just harvested had equal values. This is why 10 dou of “coarsely husked grain” could be called 1 dan “standard husked grain. ” The small dan and the large dan were <b>measuring</b> <b>units</b> and vessels specific to the measurement of grain {{in the context of the}} rationing system used in the northern border area. During the Qin and the Western Han time periods, there already existed an absolute value unit “dan” which was neither a weight nor a capacity <b>measuring</b> <b>unit.</b> “Dan,” being originally a <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for weight, used to measure “cereal plants” just harvested, was pronounced zjya(k); however, since, from the viewpoint of its value, it was equivalent to the <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for capacity dan （担）used in the measurement of “standard husked grain”, the latter capacity <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> was also called dan“石”and pronounced ta(m). Simultaneously there occurred a “transformation in the pronunciation of “dan” (石) which was pronounced like dan （担). ” As a result, whether it meant a <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for weight or for capacity, “dan” (石) in both cases could at the time be pronounced as ta（m). This relates to the fact that today the <b>measuring</b> <b>units</b> for weight and capacity dan are also read in the same way...|$|R
