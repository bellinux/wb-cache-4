5|$|Heartstrings, {{like the}} first record, was very much {{influenced}} by film, and is recognized for its cinematic quality. Juanita indicated that they deliberately made the album {{to sound like a}} soundtrack to a movie. Howling Bells along with the production team watched Paris, Texas and Blue Velvet, in an effort to replicate the mood, emotion, and atmosphere of these two films in particular. Other films that {{played a significant role in}} the making of Heartstrings include, Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde, Klute, , Nashville, Pleasantville, The Last Picture Show, and <b>Vivre</b> sa vie.|$|E
5|$|Miller's character, joie de <b>vivre</b> {{and love}} of cricket were {{expressed}} on the field during the tour, particularly in the tour games, when he played several carefree innings, hitting many sixes. He also showed his disdain for Bradman's obsession with annihilating the opposition. In one match against Essex, he deliberately {{allowed himself to be}} bowled first ball in protest against Australia's ruthless approach to batting; that day, his side set a world record for the most runs scored in a day of first-class cricket (721).|$|E
5|$|Since its release, Kadhalikka Neramillai has {{developed}} a cult status in Tamil cinema. It has been hailed as a trendsetting comedy, and the film is said to kindle a feeling of joie de <b>vivre.</b> The film's comedy sequences are regarded as evergreen. The success of their on-screen pairing led Nagesh and Sachu to act together in films such as Motor Sundaram Pillai (1966), Galatta Kalyanam (1968), Sivandha Mann (1969) Sumathi En Sundari (1971) and Urimai Kural (1974). According to The News Today, Kadhalikka Neramillai also popularised the romantic comedy genre.|$|E

5|$|A {{month after}} the opening of Peter Grimes, Britten and Yehudi Menuhin went to Germany to give {{recitals}} to concentration camp survivors. What they saw, at Belsen most of all, so shocked Britten that he refused {{to talk about it}} until towards the end of his life, when he told Pears that it had coloured everything he had written since. Colin Matthews comments that the next two works Britten composed after his return, the song-cycle The Holy Sonnets of John Donne and the Second String Quartet, contrast strongly with earlier, lighter-hearted works such as Les Illuminations. Britten recovered his joie de <b>vivre</b> for The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945), written for an educational film, Instruments of the Orchestra, directed by Muir Mathieson and featuring the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent. It became, and remained, his most often played and popular work.|$|E

25|$|At the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 {{the elected}} {{members of the}} hanging {{committee}} included Matisse, Signac and Metzinger. Following the Salon d'Automne of 1905 which {{marked the beginning of}} Fauvism, the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 marked the first time all the Fauves would exhibit together. The centerpiece of the exhibition was Matisse's monumental Le Bonheur de <b>Vivre</b> (The Joy of Life). The triangular composition is closely related to Cézanne's Bathers; a series that would soon become a source of inspiration for Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Critics were horrified by the flatness, bright colors, eclectic style and mixed technique of Le Bonheur de <b>Vivre.</b>|$|E

25|$|Naturism {{was part}} of a {{literary}} movement in the late 1800s (see the writings of André Gide) which also influenced the art movements of the time specifically Henri Matisse and other Fauve painters.

25|$|In 1970, Grothendieck, {{with two}} other mathematicians, Claude Chevalley and Pierre Samuel, created a {{political}} group called Survivre—the name later changed to Survivre et <b>vivre.</b> The group published a bulletin and was dedicated to antimilitary and ecological issues, and also developed strong criticism of the indiscriminate use of science and technology.

25|$|After {{the impact}} of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, however, Matisse was never again mistaken for an avant-garde incendiary. With the bizarre {{painting}} that appalled and electrified the cognoscenti, which understood the Les Demoiselles was at once a response to Matisse's Le bonheur de <b>vivre</b> (1905–1906) and an assault upon the tradition from which it derived, Picasso effectively appropriated the role of avant-garde wild beast—a role that, as far as public opinion was concerned, he was never to relinquish.|$|E
25|$|Together with Cees van Appeldoorn, {{he formed}} the lo-fi band Zoppo playing bass and {{prepared}} guitar in 1997. After 2 albums and several 7” singles, Landman left the band in 2000. Landman then formed the noise band Avec Aisance (aka Avec-A) with drummer/producer Valentijn Höllander and released a CD, <b>Vivre</b> dans l’aisance in 2004. After quitting Avec-A in 2006, he focused mainly on instrument building.

50|$|Brière de l'Isle issued two {{orders of}} the day during the Lang Son campaign.

Vous avez ajouté une belle page à notre histoire nationale. Honneur à vos chefs et à vous! Vous approchez du terme de votre mission. Des combats, des privations et des fatigues vous attendent encore.

500|$|The Ninth Symphony (1945), in contrast, {{was much}} lighter in tone. Gavriil Popov wrote {{that it was}} [...] "splendid in its joie de <b>vivre,</b> gaiety, brilliance, and pungency!! By 1946, however, it {{was the subject of}} criticism. Israel Nestyev asked whether it was the right time for [...] "a light and amusing {{interlude}} between Shostakovich's significant creations, a temporary rejection of great, serious problems for the sake of playful, filigree-trimmed trifles." [...] The New York World-Telegram of 27 July 1946 was similarly dismissive: [...] "The Russian composer should not have expressed his feelings about the defeat of Nazism in such a childish manner". Shostakovich continued to compose chamber music, notably his Second Piano Trio (Op. 67), dedicated to the memory of Sollertinsky, with a bittersweet, Jewish-themed totentanz finale.|$|E
500|$|Other {{friends and}} {{household}} members joined (including Gee Vaucher, Pete Wright, N. A. Palmer and Steve Herman), and Crass played their first live gig at a squatted street festival in Huntley Street, North London. They planned to play five songs, but a neighbour [...] "pulled the plug" [...] after three. Guitarist Steve Herman left the band soon afterwards, {{and was replaced}} by Phil Clancey, aka Phil Free. Joy De <b>Vivre</b> and Eve Libertine also joined around this time. Other early Crass performances included a four-date tour of New York City, a festival gig in Covent Garden and regular appearances with the U.K. Subs at The White Lion, Putney and Action Space in central London. The latter performances were often poorly attended: [...] "The audience consisted mostly of us when the Subs played and the Subs when we played".|$|E
50|$|On 5 January 1885 General Brière de l'Isle {{issued the}} {{following}} {{order of the day}} to commemorate the victory at Nui Bop:Deux brillants succès pour le corps expéditionnaire ouvrent l’année 1885.Le 3 janvier, après une marche habilement dérobée aux yeux de l’ennemi, le général de Négrier tombait, à quatre heures du soir, sur un cantonnement de 6,000 réguliers et, malgré leur vive résistance, les mettait, en moins de deux heures, en pleine déroute sans que l’obscurité de nuit lui permit de poursuivre ce premier succès. Nos troupes couchaient sur les positions enlevées.Le lendemain, avant le jour, les Chinois, au nombre de 12,000, recommençaient la lutte par un vigoureux retour offensif.Repoussés, poursuivis et enfin rejetés sur Nui-Bop, ils étaient en pleine déroute avant midi.Le centre de résistance de Nui-Bop, défendu par huit forts solidement organisés, est entre nos mains, avec deux batteries Krupp, ainsi que tout le matériel de l’ennemi: tentes, <b>vivres,</b> munitions, armes et étendards.

500|$|Of Sicily's own form of Baroque, post 1693, it {{has been}} said, [...] "The {{buildings}} conceived {{in the wake of}} this disaster expressed a light-hearted freedom of decoration whose incongruous gaiety was intended, perhaps, to assuage the horror". While this is an accurate description of a style which is almost a celebration of joie de <b>vivre</b> in stone, it is unlikely to be the reason for the choice. As with all architectural styles, the selection of style would have directly linked to current fashion. Versailles had been completed in 1688 in a far sterner Baroque style; Louis XIV's new palace was immediately emulated across Europe by any aristocrat or sovereign in Europe aspiring to wealth, taste, or power. Thus it was the obvious choice for the [...] "homeless rich" [...] of Sicily, of whom there were hundreds. The excesses of the Baroque-style palazzi and country villas to be constructed in Sicily, however, were soon to make Versailles seem a model of restraint.|$|E
500|$|Sylvie Lesas of Evigshed Magazine gave it {{a rating}} of five out of five stars, called it [...] "upbeat, fun and very fresh", and proclaimed that [...] "radios are going to love it."

Alexandra Capotorto of PopCrush rated it four stars out of five, deeming it memorable and [...] "irresistible" [...] for any demographic. Vena opined that the [...] "bit cheeky" [...] song perfectly embodies a [...] "joie de <b>vivre</b> message." [...] MSN Music's Tina Hart concluded, [...] "It's fun, pure unadulterated pop and I like it." [...] Writing for The Vancouver Sun, Leah Collins quipped {{that even though the}} song lifts its main riff from a The Clash song, [...] "this tune is as yummy and bubble-gummy as anything" [...] on One Direction's debut studio album Up All Night (2011). Newsday Glenn Gamboa acknowledged that the song is even more omnipresent than the band's previous hits combined.|$|E
