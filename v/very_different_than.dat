Brazilians, when concerned with pronunciation, look up to what is considered the national standard variety, and never the European one, specially {{after a lot of}} tension between Portugal and the settlers (immigrants) in Brazil since the country's de-facto settlement, as immigrants were forbidden of speaking freely on their native languages in Brazil by fear of severe punishment by the Portuguese law enforcers. Lately, Brazilians in general have had some exposure to European speech, through TV and music. Often one will see Brazilian actors working in Portugal, and Portuguese actors working in Brazil, despite the differences on spoken language.|$|E
25|$|The dojo has {{a league}} also. Each of the {{students}} competes. The stronger a player is, the fewer games they have to play. Two different time limit rules {{are used in the}} league games. There is a longer time limit where each player has a minute to move, and hayago where the players are given just 10 seconds to make a move. There is no time limit, so any given player can play 1 or 10 games in one day. The league also has a rating system. The ratings are based on the players' winning percentages. There is a handicap, but one that was <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> the orthodox system of allowing the opponent to place the number of stones to the difference in rank. The stronger player gets 10 seconds less in their time for every number difference in rank. There is also a reverse komi rule. 0 komi, —3 komi, —5 komi, and —8 komi.|$|E

Austin is a very rich, down-to-earth country man. He is <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> Naomi's ex-boyfriend Max, who was the complete opposite. Naomi throws a big elaborate beginning of school party for CU students, but this backfires when the party is raided by the police and Naomi disposes of Austin's marijuana plants by tossing them on a bonfire, causing CU's star quarterback to later test positive for drug use. The disastrous party causes Naomi to enter CU as the most unpopular girl in school, a situation she attempts to rectify by pledging a popular sorority. Initially, things appear to be going well as Naomi is taken under the wing of the sorority President, Holly (Megalyn Echikunwoke). But after performing a series of humiliating hazing rituals, Naomi discovers that Holly never intended to let her into the sorority and that this was all done to humiliate Naomi.

Naomi has sex with Austin after he agrees to help her new sorority humiliate Holly. However, she later learns that Austin was using her to break up with Holly, whom he had been dating. When Holly invites Max to a campus event to unsettle Naomi, she rekindles her romance with him, but still finds herself attracted to Austin.

The film {{tells the story}} of two high school {{students}} who go through a series of comic misadventures after they plan to buy alcohol for a party. To play the role of Hill's romantic interest, she dyed her hair red. A reviewer for The Hollywood Reporter found her [...] "appealing", but felt that her role was poorly written. Stone has described the experience of acting in her first film as [...] "amazing... <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> other experiences I've had since then".

Gerety and Seda each previously played their respective characters in guest appearances on the show; Seda's character Paul Falsone {{first appeared in the}} two-part [...] finale. Stuart Gharty, Gerety's character, is described as a transplant from the department's internal affairs department. Executive producer Tom Fontana said he thought the new cast additions would create drama and tension between the characters: [...] "It's stimulating to add new people, because you're not feeling like you're writing or acting the same scene for the thousandth time, and I think all three of them are <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> any other characters we've had on the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Georgia Taylor {{was cast}} as Toyah {{and the role}} marked her acting debut. Taylor was {{studying}} for her A-levels when she originally auditioned for the part of Zoe Tattersall. She was unsuccessful, so she then auditioned for Toyah and won the role. Of her casting, she explained [...] "When I got the call to say that I'd got the part I just sat there open-mouthed, hugging my best friend. I could barely believe it. It is all <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> being on stage – it's not quite so intense because your audience isn't {{right there in front}} of you. But it's a very different type of satisfaction, working much faster with storylines and characters developing all the time." [...] At the time of her casting, Taylor was two years older than the character she portrayed.|$|E
500|$|Carey's {{most recent}} studio effort at the time, Butterfly, also yielded two number one songs.

500|$|The teleplay {{and story}} {{were written by}} series creator Marc Cherry, and the episode was {{directed}} by Paul McGuigan. Most filming occurred in and around Los Angeles. Cherry created the show with a multiple female lead dynamic that was similar to his previous success, Desperate Housewives. His first job in Hollywood was as a personal assistant, allowing him {{to relate to the}} maid characters to some degree. He felt that Devious Maids provided a vehicle to deal with themes that Desperate Housewives did not, while being <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> the similarly themed Downton Abbey, due to Downton's historic nature. The format of the show that was pitched to ABC was as a spinoff of Desperate Housewives. While Roselyn Sanchez's character Carmen appeared as a gardener in the final episode of Desperate Housewives, [...] "Finishing the Hat", the final version that was produced is not strictly a spinoff.|$|E
500|$|... "My All" [...] is a slow-tempo ballad, that blends {{contemporary}} R {{beats and}} Latin guitar and chord melodies, making subtle use of Latin percussion {{in the first}} chorus. The song is described as having a [...] "lush sound" [...] and featured synthetic guitar arpeggios that were produced in the studio. [...] "My All" [...] was compared to Toni Braxton's music style, described as [...] "slink, slow-jam R sounds." [...] The song {{is set in the}} signature common time, and is written in the key of G minor. It features a basic chord progression of A-F-1. Carey's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of B2 to the high note of F5, with the piano and guitar pieces range from G3 to G5. The track was <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> anything Carey had ever recorded, incorporating strong [...] "Latin cultured background." [...] The instrumentation and vocal arrangement used in the song was compared to Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds' productions, due to its [...] "soft R coos and guitar melodies." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{confirmed}} on March 24, 2009 that Shawnee Smith would return as Amanda Young.

On April 19 it was announced that James Van Patten would return as Dr. Heffner, a character featured in the opening scene of the fourth installment performing the autopsy on John Kramer. Peter Outerbridge was cast as a new character, William, and Tobin Bell, Betsy Russell, and Mark Rolston returned as their characters John Kramer, Jill Tuck, and Special Agent Erickson, respectively. Russell commented about her character: [...] "You find out a little more about if Jill is good or evil. Pretty much you'll know." [...] Greutert wanted to bring Cary Elwes's character Dr. Gordon back but Elwes was not available.
