The long-wheelbase version was used in the 503. Both cars used the steering system and a variant of the front suspension system from the 502; the 503 also used the 502's rear suspension.

50|$|The bumpers on the 1933 Series 355C were sectioned, with plain {{ends and}} a three bar center. The grille was made V-shaped and blended into the painted (chrome optional) {{radiator}} shell. The radiator cap disappeared {{under the hood}} {{on the right side}} (same side as the oil level gauge). The fender tie bar, after a year's absence was sectioned and the center section was hidden behind the grille. Six horizontal doors replaced the vertical hood doors. Skirts were added to the front and rear fenders. The most significant change in body detail was the introduction of no-draft Individually Controlled Ventilation (ICV) or pivoting vent windows in the front doors and the rear quarter or rear door windows. In early production the front door window had to be lowered to disengage the channel at its front edge from the vent window to allow the vent window to pivot. In later production the sealing channel was attached to the door frame rather than to the window glass so that the vent window could be operated independently of the window glass. Windshield and rear quarter windows were made stationary. Absence of a windshield operating mechanism on the closed car allowed room to conceal the wiper motor behind the headboard. The cowl ventilator was baffled and drained {{in such a way as}} to be rainproof. Chassis changes were few and minor in nature. Controlled free wheeling was discontinued. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>assist</b> was added to the brake system. Changes in shock absorber valves extended the range of the ride control system.

OBJECTIVES: To study the effectiveness of <b>vacuum</b> <b>assisted</b> dressings in terms of Rate of wound healing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: we carried out a prospective study at Narayana medical college hospital on two groups (group A and group B) of diabetic foot ulcer patients, whom we selected randomly after considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>assisted</b> dressings were done in group A patients and normal moist wound dressings in group B.

40|$|Total {{suspended}} solids (TSS) are all particles in water {{that will not}} pass through a glass fiber filter with a pore size less than 2 Î¼m, including sediments, algae, nutrients, and metals. TSS is an important water quality parameter because of its adverse effects on aquatic species and wildlife. The EPA has proposed a regulation for turbidity, a related water quality parameter, which has been stayed pending further testing. TSS is regulated through the EPA via the NPDES in many states. Since there are no accepted field tests for TSS, projects with TSS regulations must send samples to a laboratory for analysis, which can delay projects for days. The goal {{of this research was}} to develop a rapid, cost-effective, and consistent method for direct measurement of TSS in the field. Theoretical analyses of three initial designs (centrifugation, rapid heating, and rapid filtration using <b>vacuum</b> <b>assist)</b> showed that in order to obtain sufficient suspended material to measure in the field, too much water would be needed for each sample to be feasible for centrifugation and rapid heating. A new prototype rapid filtration system design was developed for evaluation. Subsequent testing showed this system to be inaccurate. A second system was modified the method was modified to for rapid filtration with no vacuum. Testing of this system also showed results were not precise enough to be a feasible field test. It was concluded that none of the described methods were currently feasible, and that the laboratory test could also have inaccuracies in measuring water samples tested to meet regulation standards.
