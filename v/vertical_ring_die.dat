Determine the reasonable number of roller on the theory of fatigue damage after drawing up the related design parameters of <b>ring</b> <b>die</b> and the roller, a three-dimensional model of the link mold pellet machine is established using Pro/E soft-ware, and transferred the model into ADAMS software through Mech/Pro which dedicated interface software, then used ADAMS to make a dynamics simulation.

40|$|<b>Vertical</b> annual <b>rings</b> can be {{obtained}} from radially sawn timber. Compared to other annual ring directions timber with <b>vertical</b> annual <b>rings</b> have a number of advantages, like it is less susceptible to crack during drying and the moisture movements are uniform. In this study a definition of <b>vertical</b> annual <b>rings</b> has been proposed. The definition is based on condition that the moisture movement of the width should not exceed ten percent, as a result of deviation from exactly <b>vertical</b> annual <b>rings.</b> According to the developed definition pine (Pinus silvestris L) and spruce (Picea abies Karst) are considered to have vertical annual ringsifthe angle between the flat side and the tangent to the annual ring at half the thickness is between 60 and 90 degrees. To avoid surface cracks one should take particular attention on the annual ring orientation in the surface of lumber with thicker dimensions...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} types of pellet mills that can be {{generally}} grouped into large-scale and small-scale types. According to the production capacity, pellet mills also {{can be divided into}} flat die pellet mill and <b>ring</b> <b>die</b> pellet mill.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two common}} types of {{large-scale}} pellet mills: flat <b>die</b> mills and <b>ring</b> <b>die</b> mills. Flat die mills use a flat die with slots. The powder is {{introduced to the}} top of the die and as the die rotates a roller presses the powder through the holes in the die. A cutter on the other side of the die cuts the exposed pellet free from the <b>die.</b> In the <b>ring</b> <b>die</b> there are radial slot throughout the die. Powder is fed into the inside of the die and spreaders evenly distribute the powder. Two rollers then compress the powder through the die holes. Two cutters are used to cut the pellets free from the outside of the die.|$|R

40|$|The PrimWood method. Part 1 : Properties and {{production}} of timber with <b>vertical</b> annual <b>rings.</b> Old traditions and modern measurements show that radial sawn wood is subject to smaller moisture movements in {{the plane of the}} surface and has a harder surface and better shape-stability than timber sawn by conventional sawing techniques such as square sawing and through-and-through sawing. The advantages are greater if the juvenile wood is removed. Timber with radial faces and where the juvenile wood has been removed is said to have <b>vertical</b> annual <b>rings,</b> and such timber is particularly valuable for products such as floors, furniture, panels and exterior carpentry. The special properties of the timber are then utilised in the best possible manner. The PrimWood method is a new production concept for the manufacture of high quality wood components and boards of massive wood from both softwood and hardwood. The concept leads to a knot-free material with <b>vertical</b> annual <b>rings.</b> Upprättat; 2007; 20140902 (dicsan...|$|R
40|$|The novel {{concept of}} nadir energy planes {{has been used}} to {{illuminate}} the principles governing the preferred orientation of rings A-C in PPh 3 1, coordinated to achiral octahedral metal complexes of the type [M(PPh 3) L 1 - 5] 2 a-d, and prochiral octahedral metal complexes of the type [M(η 5 -C 5 H 5) (PPh 3) L 2] 3, and [M(η 6 -C 6 H 6) (PPh 3) L 2] 4. An achiral arrangement of complex-bound 1 (reminiscent of the transition state for the one-ring flip stereoisomerisation process) orients all three ring apices proximal to three of the four orthogonal nadir energy planes associated with an octahedral metal centre. From this achiral arrangement, the favoured, degenerate conformations of complex-bound 1 may be subsequently derived by applying the following principles (in descending order of priority), (i) superimpose the <b>vertical</b> <b>ring</b> A of the achiral conformer onto the least encumbered nadir plane, (ii) allow ring B to tilt onto the least encumbered nadir plane orthogonal to the <b>vertical</b> <b>ring</b> A, and (iii) tilt ring B in a manner which orients the flatter ring C beneath the smallest ligand. These principles are wholly consistent with 60 X-ray crystal structures, and detailed conformational analyses. The phenomenon of PPh 3 ligand tilting, consistent with intramolecular steric strain, is characterised...|$|R

50|$|The spheromak {{configuration}} {{is similar}} in arrangement to a smoke ring. The FRC is also toroidal, but extended into a tubular shape or hollow cylinder. The main {{difference between the two}} is that the spheromak contains poloidal (<b>vertical</b> <b>rings)</b> and toroidal (horizontal) magnetic fields, while the FRC has only the poloidal fields and requires an external magnet for confinement. In both cases the combination of electrical currents and their associated magnetic fields result in a series of closed magnetic lines that maintains the ring shape, without the need for magnets {{in the center of the}} plasma (unlike a tokamak).|$|R
50|$|While others suggest these {{sandstone}} spires are {{the result}} of sandstone intrusions which were created {{as a result of the}} tectonic activity in the Plio-Pleistocene time, the time of the uplift of the surrounding plateaus. Indications for this model include the concentric <b>vertical</b> <b>ring</b> structure of the columns themselves where each of the three <b>vertical</b> <b>rings</b> of sandstone, central, inner, and outer, can be traced and matched to a distinct sedimentary formation below. Also the truncation of two of the structures, at Shepherd's Point, by Pleistocene sheet conglomerates, and other intrusions which pierce through Pleistocene river deposited conglomerates place the intrusion event in the Pleistocene. The river conglomerates are truncated by the sheet conglomerates. Sheet conglomerates are usually caused by major seismic activity. There are also quite large well-rounded clasts, ranging in size from 2.5 centimeters and greater, found along the outer layer of the sandstone spires which are from the Pleistocene river conglomerates. Smaller less rounded, more angular clasts, about a centimeter or less in width, are also found and are from the red claystones layers found in the intruded sandstones. These clearly indicate that the pierced formations were well lithified. Additionally, the area has large masses of sandstone dikes. The spires have no evidence of a chaotic, mixing flow regime, rather they indicate a laminar flow not suggestive of hot springs or geysers. The outer surface is highly lithified, but within a few millimeters, the sandstone is quite friable.|$|R

40|$|An {{explanation}} for the vertical structure and thickness of Saturn's rings compatible with observational data is presented. The model of the rings as being many particles thick is shown to be possible, with random particle motions preventing the complete flattening {{of the system and}} a gaussian distribution of particle density with vertical displacement. The model prediction of a maximum ring thickness of tens of meters, however, is in conflict with observations of ring thickness of at least 0. 8 km at ring-plane passage. It is shown that perturbations to ring particle orbits caused by the sun and Saturn's large satellites may produce long- and short-period coherent <b>vertical</b> <b>ring</b> displacements and a nonlinear displacement of the ring plane from the equatorial plane with radial distance, leading to an apparent edge-on thickness of a few hundred meters...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a study on the water absorption capacity and solubility of biodegradable starch foams produced with single-screw extruder TS- 45 with L/D= 12. Two different moulding dies were used: one with a circular hole with the diameter of 3 mm and one with a ring hole with the inner diameter of 5 mm. During the extrusion process, the temperature of the cylinder ranged from 80 to 130 °C and the screw speeds applied were: 100 and 130 rpm. For the application of the <b>ring</b> <b>die,</b> it was observed that regardless of the speed of the screw, the use of the raw material of higher moisture content led to the production of materials with higher solubility. As a result, the obtained materials revealed solubility at a level of 40 %.
