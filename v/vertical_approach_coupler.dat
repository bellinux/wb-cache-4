40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the clinical utility of adding lateral <b>approach</b> to conventional <b>vertical</b> <b>approach</b> for prone stereotactic vacuum-assisted breast biopsies. Materials and Methods: From April 2010 to May 2012, 130 vacuum-assisted stereotactic biopsies were attempted in 127 patients. While a <b>vertical</b> <b>approach</b> was preferred, a lateral approach was used if the <b>vertical</b> <b>approach</b> failed. The success rate of biopsies utilizing only a <b>vertical</b> <b>approach</b> was compared with that using both <b>vertical</b> and lateral <b>approaches</b> and the breast thickness for both procedures was measured and compared with that for <b>vertical</b> <b>approach.</b> In addition, pathology results were evaluated and the causes of the failed biopsies were analyzed. Results: Of the 130 cases, 127 biopsies were performed and 3 biopsies failed. The success rate of the <b>vertical</b> <b>approach</b> was 83. 8 % (109 / 130); however, when the lateral approach was also used, the success rate increased to 97. 7 % (127 / 130) (p = 0. 0004). The mean breast thickness was 2. 7 ± 1 cm for the lateral approach and 4 ± 1. 2 cm for the <b>vertical</b> <b>approach</b> (p < 0. 0001). The histopathologic results in 76 (59. 8 %) of the biopsies were benign, 23 (18. 1 %) were high-risk lesions, and 28 (22. 0 %) were malignant. The causes of biopsy failure were thin breasts (n = 2) and undetected difficult lesion location (n = 1).

40|$|Abstract. In {{the data}} mining field, data {{representation}} {{turns out to}} be one of the major factors affecting mining algorithm scalability. Mining Frequent Itemsets (MFI) is a data mining problem that is heavily affected by this fact. The <b>vertical</b> <b>approach</b> is one of the successful data representations adopted for MFI problem. The main advantage of this approach is support for fast frequency counting via join-ing operations. Recently, an encoding method called prime-encoding is proposed as an enhancement for the <b>vertical</b> <b>approach</b> [10]. The performance study introduced in [10] confirmed the high quality of prime-encoding based vertical mining of fre-quent sequence over other vertical and horizontal ones in terms of space and time. Though sequence mining is more general than itemset mining, this paper presents a prime-encoding based vertical mining of frequent itemsets with new optimizations and a new re-encoding method that further enhance memory and speed. The exper-imental results show that prime encoding based vertical itemset mining is suitable for high-dimensional sparse data...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare two dierent {{approaches}} to analyse the second-order behaviour of a convex function. The rst one is classical, {{we call it}} the horizontal approach; the second one is more recent, it is the <b>vertical</b> <b>approach.</b> We prove equivalences between horizontal and vertical growth conditions. Then we derive well-known directional results. Finally we show that the <b>vertical</b> <b>approach</b> is particularly interesting to get more than a rst-order (and more than directional) analysis of the maximum eigenvalue function. Key words.

50|$|Parasitoid wasps have {{specialized}} {{behavior for}} ovipositing on their hosts. For example, those that attack ants either use a horizontal or <b>vertical</b> alighting <b>approach</b> {{from behind the}} host. In the horizontal method, the wasp maintains its body horizontally until it grabs on to the ant's metasoma (upper abdomen) with its tarsi (lower legs). After that, it places {{the rest of its}} legs on the ant's abdomen, folds its wings, and proceeds to inject its victim with the ovipositor. The <b>vertical</b> <b>approach</b> is more complicated, and requires more steps. The wasp attaches its front legs onto the ant's abdomen, then rotates 180 degrees so that it becomes upside down. After that, it rotates once more so that its head and legs switch places, before inserting its ovipositor.|$|R
