40|$|AbstractMany {{industrial}} engineering problems require fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis and dynamics analysis to improve functionality or operational performance. One such {{problem is the}} popping off of pressure safety valve (PSV) widely used in pressure vessels and pipes. Popping off of a spring-loaded pressure safety valve (PSV) is crucial to prevent the pressure vessel or pipe from overpressure. It's difficult to observe {{the dynamics of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>disc</b> as well as the flow characteristics through the small chamber between the <b>valve</b> <b>disc</b> and valve seat over such a remarkable short period in the past. To address this issue, a transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model with moving grid technique has been presented in this work. Fine structure grid has been generated over the whole flow domain to ensure that the <b>valve</b> <b>disc</b> can move freely and continuously without negative volume problem. Two types of time-dependent overpressure are given to simulate the popping of the PSV under different overpressure conditions. Response parameters such as the displacement of the disc, fluid force on the disc and the blowdown value are monitored to see their influence on the popping of the valve. The results are helpful to improve the popping action of the valve in design stage, and demonstrate the availability and efficiency of using transient CFD simulation in the popping analysis of spring-loaded PSV...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{butterfly}} valve {{is a type}} of flow control device, which is widely used to regulate a fluid flowing through a section of pipe. Currently, analyses and optimization are of special important in the design and usage of {{butterfly valve}}s. For the analysis, finite element method (FEM) is often used to predict the safety of <b>valve</b> <b>disc,</b> and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is commonly used to study the flow characteristics of valve. However, it is difficult to obtain accurate results for the optimization of butterfly valve due to the high non-linearities. For this reason, metamodels or surrogate model methods are extensively employed. This paper integrates metamodel with FEM and CFD analysis to optimize a traditional butterfly valve, where the weight of the <b>valve</b> <b>disc</b> is the design objective, and the strength safety of disc and the pressure loss coefficient of valve are constraints. Kriging model is employed as a surrogate model to formulate the objectives and constrains, and the orthogonal array is used as design of experiment to sample the computer analysis. The optimum results with the corresponding variable combinations for the <b>valve</b> <b>disc</b> are obtained easily by this method. Moreover, the structural and fluid analyses with the obtained optimum variable combinations are conducted again to verify the accuracy of the optimization method. The results demonstrate the capability and potential of this method, which integrates the Kriging model with FEM and CFD analysis, in solving the optimization of a butterfly valve...|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 221 Compared to {{leading edge}} {{technologies}} such as high speed turbomachinery, reciprocating pumps {{may appear to be}} a simple technology: A reciprocating plunger causes liquid to be drawn from a low pressure manifold through the suction check valves, and expelled into a high pressure manifold through the discharge check valves. However, the interaction of flow, valve dynamics, and the acoustics of the pump and piping system can generate high amplitude pressure pulsation, causing severe vibration and reliability problem in some systems. The effects of improperly operating valves, and the successful resolution of such problems with valve design modifications are examined. Since the pump vales are operated by the action of the fluid, valve components (including the spring, valve body, <b>valve</b> <b>disc</b> shape, and sealing surfaces, etc.) must be carefully selected to ensure that the valves open and close at the appropriate times. Problems associated with valve dynamics include over pressure spikes at the opening of discharge valves, under pressure spikes {{at the opening of the}} suction valves, high noise levels, and excessive wear of valve components. Severe over pressure spikes have been known to cause fatigue failures of pump working barrels, connecting rods, bearings, and even drive-train components. Under pressure spikes can cause cavitation that can also lead to plunger and valve failures, due to pitting damage. High level valve noise is usually indicative of sever impacts associated with the opening and closing of the valves. Impacts at the valve closing are sometimes referred to as valve hammer and can result in damage to the sealing surfaces. Impacts at the valve opening, which may be identified by damage to the back side of the <b>valve</b> <b>disc,</b> are due to the over pressure and under pressure spikes which can result in fatigue failures of the components. Excessive valve wear can also be experienced when the <b>valve</b> <b>disc</b> material is not suitable for the pumping conditions. The use of field data coupled with a computer model to analyze the valve dynamics will be presented. Using this tool, the effect of various valve modifications such as changes in sealing surfaces, valve lift, spring preload, and spring stiffness can be observed. Instrumentation and data analysis techniques to evaluate these problems will also be discussed. The effects of modifications to valves (including changes in lift, spring preload, spring construction and stiffness, <b>valve</b> <b>disc</b> geometries, etc.) will be examined using data from actual systems...|$|E

Unfortunately, the use of Delrin as the occluder material was problematic, and in 1971 this led to its replacement with a pyrolitic carbon-coated occluder. The study aim was to report and to determine the mechanism of wear on BSD <b>valve</b> <b>discs.</b> To achieve this, three BSD valves which had {{been in place for}} between 312 and 355 months were explanted and analyzed. Methods: Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate material imperfections or damage to the housing and occluder components of the explanted valves. Results: The <b>valve</b> <b>discs</b> showed more than one type of wear pattern. Notably, the wear pattern observed on the surface and edge of the disc did not affect correct in-vivo function of the valves, as indicated by their long implantation period. No cracks, fractures or perforations of the Delrin discs were observed, but clear imprints caused by the impact of the struts on the inlet and outlet disc surfaces were detected. The depth of the strut imprints was indicative of a hindered disc rotation. A reduction in the diameter of the Delrin disc (ca. 1. 44 mm) was detected in valve # 3. Conclusion: The results obtained for the three BSD valves were in agreement with data reported elsewhere, and showed good performance of this mechanical valve. Although the clinical follow up for these second-generation mechanical valves is extensive and supportive of their good clinical performance, they may in time fail due to wear of the polymer surface...|$|R

Group A: controls without treatment, Group B: decellularization only, Group C: decellularization and glutaraldehyde cross-linking, Group D: decellularization and glutaraldehyde cross-linking followed by surface heparin treatment. After implantation in New Zealand White rabbits for 60 days, the explanted heart <b>valve</b> <b>discs</b> from the different study groups underwent a series of histological examinations as well as determination of calcium content by the methyl thyme phenol blue colorimetric method. Results of the explanted heart <b>valve</b> <b>discs</b> for the Von Kossa staining demonstrated that in Group A the heart valve tissue was the most severely stained with black color, whereas in Group D there was hardly any area that was stained black after implantation indicating the least tissue calcification. Furthermore, the inflammatory cells identified by the Hematoxylineosin staining appeared to be the least in Group D. The average tissue calcium content was highest in Group A (0. 197 +/- 0. 115 mu mol mg(- 1)), modest in Group B (0. 113 +/- 0. 041 gmol mg(- 1)), and Group C (0. 089 +/- 0. 049 gmol mg(- 1)), and the lowest in Group D (0. 019 +/- 0. 019 gmol mg(- 1), p < 0. 05).

At the onset of diastolic phase, the flow goes through the major orifice and then through the minor orifice. The two jets generated induce two counterclockwise vortices within the ventricle, which can lead to a partial closure of the valve during mitral E wave deceleration. During diastasis and mitral A wave, only one vortex persists in the ventricle and pushes the valve disk backward at the end of the diastolic phase.

40|$|AbstractThe {{two phase flow}} of air {{and water}} is studied in a safety relief valve {{commonly}} used in the industrial refrigeration industry. In some blowdown conditions a valve which has been specified for gas only operation may encounter flows which include liquid droplets, these having been entrained from upstream processes. Of particular interest is the operation under two phase flow conditions which will be dominated by the altered flow capacity and forces acting on the valve. To examine these effects {{the characteristics of the}} flow through the valve and the forces acting on the <b>valve</b> <b>disc</b> have been examined for an air water mixtures for a range of pressures, 5 - 14 bar, and a wide range of gas mass fractions for various different opening positions. These characteristics determine the capacity of the valve to control pressure, the sizing of the spring and the dynamics of the valve during operation. The data on such effects for safety valves is very limited and here we show the trends that result from the introduction of two phase flow mixtures and reflect on the limited previous work in the literature that is available. The tested range of conditions the results indicate that the flow and force characteristics are influenced by liquid injection with a significant influence on the flowrate. The disc forces resulting from the two phase impacts show a small but notable effect from liquid mass fractions. This is in contrast to previous limited data found in the literature...|$|E
