5|$|The {{industry}} expanded {{rapidly in}} the 1940s because World WarII created a huge demand for inexpensive, mass-produced products. In 1946, American inventor James Watson Hendry built the first screw injection machine, which allowed much more precise control over the speed of injection {{and the quality of}} articles produced. This machine also allowed material to be mixed before injection, so that coloured or recycled plastic could be added to <b>virgin</b> <b>material</b> and mixed thoroughly before being injected. Today, screw injection machines account {{for the vast majority of}} all injection machines. In the 1970s, Hendry went on to develop the first gas-assisted injection moulding process, which permitted the production of complex, hollow articles that cooled quickly. This greatly improved design flexibility as well as the strength and finish of manufactured parts while reducing production time, cost, weight and waste.|$|E
2500|$|Oxidation of {{antimony}} metal dominates in Europe. Several {{processes for}} the production of crude antimony(III) oxide or metallic antimony from <b>virgin</b> <b>material.</b> The choice of process depends on the composition of the ore and other factors. [...] Typical steps include mining, crushing and grinding of ore, sometimes followed by froth flotation and separation of the metal using pyrometallurgical processes (smelting or roasting) or in a few cases (e.g. when the ore is rich in precious metals) by hydrometallurgical processes. These steps do not take place in the EU but closer to the mining location.|$|E
2500|$|In pre-industrial times, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of scrap bronze and other metals being collected in Europe and melted down for perpetual reuse. Paper recycling was first recorded in 1031 when Japanese shops sold repulped paper. In Britain dust and ash from wood and coal fires was collected by [...] "dustmen" [...] and downcycled as a base material used in brick making. The main driver for these types of recycling was the economic advantage of obtaining recycled feedstock instead of acquiring <b>virgin</b> <b>material,</b> as well as a lack of public waste removal in ever more densely populated areas. In 1813, Benjamin Law developed the process of turning rags into [...] "shoddy" [...] and [...] "mungo" [...] wool in Batley, Yorkshire. This material combined recycled fibers with virgin wool. The West Yorkshire shoddy industry in towns such as Batley and Dewsbury lasted from the early 19th century to at least 1914.|$|E
40|$|Extraction of <b>virgin</b> <b>materials</b> will {{eventually}} {{end up as}} waste {{in the form of}} emissions to land, air and water. Thus, the effect on material use is a more informative indicator of the outcome of waste policies than the impacts on the amounts recycled and sent to end treatment. Among the major causes of inefficiencies related to waste are biased tax policies and regulations, which comprise indirect subsidisation of <b>virgin</b> <b>materials.</b> Heavier taxation of <b>virgin</b> <b>materials</b> and less taxation of labour contribute to changes in relative factor prices which better reflect the social value of the resources, without increasing the overall costs. This analysis based on a general equilibrium modelling approach illustrates the effects of such a reform on environmental and economic measures, and shows that there is a considerable potential of net benefits, not only from less use of <b>virgin</b> <b>materials,</b> but also from a general reduction in air emissions...|$|R

5000|$|The {{extent to}} which {{recycled}} material displaces production of <b>virgin</b> <b>material</b> of a similar or different type {{is the subject of}} current research. In case studies, practitioners typically utilize heuristic, arbitrary rules, such as assigning 100%, 50%, or 0% displacement of <b>virgin</b> <b>material</b> by recycled material. [...] However, accurate information on the displacement rates of various materials is largely unknown. This information is important to LCA practitioners, as it can often tip the balance between two compared alternative products or materials.|$|E
50|$|Melting is {{performed}} in a furnace. <b>Virgin</b> <b>material,</b> external scrap, internal scrap, and alloying elements are used to charge the furnace. <b>Virgin</b> <b>material</b> refers to commercially pure forms of the primary metal used to form a particular alloy. Alloying elements are either pure forms of an alloying element, like electrolytic nickel, or alloys of limited composition, such as ferroalloys or master alloys. External scrap is material from other forming processes such as punching, forging, or machining. Internal scrap consists of gates, risers, defective castings, and other extraneous metal oddments produced within the facility.|$|E

5000|$|Reuse of coal ash {{benefits}} the environment {{by reducing the}} production of greenhouse gas and reducing the need to use <b>virgin</b> <b>materials.</b> In addition, when coal ash is recycled, costs related to coal ash disposal sites are avoided.

5000|$|Recovery & Recycling: Wastes {{are also}} good sources of raw materials.

30|$|A common {{assumption}} is that closing supply chains would drive the reduction in extracting <b>virgin</b> <b>materials</b> {{as a consequence of}} their replacement with secondary circular flows (Ferrer and Ayres 2000).

In addition, LSI installed numerous bat boxes beneath the decks of the new SH 130 bridges to support Mexican free-tailed bat colonies.|$|E
50|$|As metal use has {{increased}} during the 20th and 21st centuries, {{there has been}} a substantial shift from metal resources being subterranean geological stores to becoming ‘above-ground’ stocks in use in society. Metals can be used over and over again, saving energy and minimising the negative environmental impacts associated with mining <b>virgin</b> <b>material,</b> so it makes sense to recycle these above-ground stocks. However, the report found that {{less than a third of}} the crucial 60 metals studied in the report have an end-of-life recycling rate above 50 per cent, and 34 of them have a recycling rate of below 1 per cent.|$|E
50|$|Miniwiz {{claims that}} most of post-consumer, {{agricultural}} and industrial waste can be recycled into materials that, if enhanced, can be reused to substitute any <b>virgin</b> <b>material.</b> Avoiding the usage of toxic and environment polluting chemical agents, Miniwiz reworks the composition of its recycled materials. Miniwiz developed a set of materials 100% made from trash that combines polymers with Nano-Silica extracted from organic elements of agriculture waste {{as well as other}} non-toxic chemical and mechanical reinforcements. Polymers developed by Miniwiz all enter in the category of thermoplastics, ensuring a reduced carbon footprint during the phase of transformation into products and possible re-recycling after usage.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 10 years, the focus in waste {{management}} {{has shifted from}} solving environmental impacts of waste disposal to managing materials’ cycles in a sustainable way. Recycling materials from waste streams {{plays an important role}} in the new paradigm of sustainable materials’ management and resource efﬁciency. In particular, it is argued that recycled materials can substitute for the extraction of exhaustible resources, thereby alleviating problems like materials’ scarcity and dependency. In addition, they can reduce environmental impacts related to mining, processing and production of <b>virgin</b> <b>materials</b> (Damgaard et al., 2009; European Commission, 2011; Acuff and Kafﬁne, 2013). This chapter will focus on economic drivers and impediments to recycling. In particular we will discuss how recycling incentives of consumers and producers are affected by policy instruments like recycled content standards, taxes on <b>virgin</b> <b>materials,</b> waste disposal fees, recycling subsidy mechanisms, extended producer responsibility (EPR or deposit-refund in the sequel) and recycling certiﬁcates schemes. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In the era {{of global}} {{financial}} crisis, every penny counts. Thus, the exclusive use of <b>virgin</b> <b>materials</b> for production no longer makes economic sense. As {{a viable alternative to}} the use of <b>virgin</b> <b>materials,</b> recycling has become a popular business practice. Recycling, however, requires dramatic changes in business paradigms that include the coordination of both forward and reverse logistics flows, the substitution of disposal for salvage, and the tracing of products throughout their entire life cycles. These changes are often preceded by cultural changes across the supply chain. To embark on the successful change in reverse logistics activities, this paper proposes a Theory of Constraints (TOC) that can map necessary changes in the supply chain and guide those changes within various system constraints. The usefulness of TOC is validated by applying it to the recycling processes of automobile tyres in the burgeoning Chinese automobile industry.

50|$|Post-consumer resin (PCR) is a {{blend of}} {{reclaimed}} natural HDPE (primarily from milk and water containers) and virgin resin. The recycled material is cleaned, ground and recompounded into uniform pellets along with prime <b>virgin</b> <b>material</b> especially designed to build up environmental stress crack resistance. PCR has no odor but exhibits a slight yellow tint in its natural state. This tint can be hidden by the addition of color. PCR is easily processed and inexpensive. However, it cannot come into direct contact with food or pharmaceutical products. PCR can be produced in a variety of recycled content percentages up to 100%.|$|E
5000|$|Avoided {{burden is}} an {{approach}} used in life-cycle assessment (LCA), {{especially in the}} context of allocating environmental burden in the presence of recycling or reuse. When determining the overall environmental impact of a product, the product is given [...] "credit" [...] for the potential recycled material included. For instance, PET bottles may be given environmental credit for the PET they contain, as this material will eventually be recycled back into further PET products. This credit is termed [...] "avoided burden" [...] because it refers to the impact of <b>virgin</b> <b>material</b> production that is avoided by the use of recycled material.|$|E
5000|$|Hence, when {{self-healing}} is assessed, different parameters {{need to be}} considered: type {{of stimulus}} (if any), healing time, maximum amount of healing cycles the material can tolerate, and degree of recovery, all whilst considering the material's virgin properties.This typically takes account of relevant physical parameters such as tensile modulus, elongation at break, fatigue-resistance, barrier properties, colour and transparency.The self-healing ability of a given material generally refers to the recovery of a specific property relative to the <b>virgin</b> <b>material,</b> designated as the self-healing efficiency. The self-healing efficiency can be quantified by comparing the respective experimental value obtained for the undamaged virgin sample (fvirgin) with the healed sample (fhealed) (eq. 1) ...|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} energy saved through {{recycling}} depends upon the material being recycled {{and the type of}} energy accounting that is used. Correct accounting for this saved energy can be accomplished with life-cycle analysis using real energy values. In addition, exergy, which is a measure of useful energy can be used. In general, it takes far less energy to produce a unit mass of recycled materials than it does to make the same mass of <b>virgin</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractWarm mix asphalt (WMA) {{has been}} popularly used in {{all over the}} world to reduce both energy {{consumptions}} and carbon emissions in asphalt paving industry. The long-term aging characterization of binders containing WMA additive was evaluated in this research. The penetration grade 60 / 80 and SBS modified binders were selected as <b>virgin</b> <b>materials.</b> The Sasobit, WMA additive, was blended into <b>virgin</b> <b>materials</b> with 2 %, 3 %, 4 % and 5 % by weight of binders. The warm modified binders were aged by means of the rolling thin film oven (RTFO) and pressure aging vessel (PAV). A serial of laboratory studies, such as Penetration, four-constituents, rotational viscometer (RV), dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) and bending beam rheometer (BBR), were conducted on both virgin binders and long-term aging binders. The aged rates of binders were calculated and compared. The results showed that the virgin binders played an important role in the determination of warm modified binder's properties and colloid-structures. However, compared to the aging regulation of virgin and warm modified binders, Sasobit had no or marginally positive influence on the long-term aging characterization (affected by virgin binder type) of warm modified binders...|$|R

5000|$|The term coil (or furnace) {{visbreaking}} {{is applied}} to units where the cracking process occurs in the furnace tubes (or [...] "coils").

The gas oil is recovered and re-used. The extent of the cracking reaction is controlled by regulation of the speed of flow of the oil through the furnace tubes. The quenched oil then passes to a fractionator where the products of the cracking (gas, LPG, gasoline, gas oil and tar) are separated and recovered.|$|E

Most greenhouse gases attributed to waste {{are the result of}} energy consumed in lifecycle stages upstream from the landfill (materials extraction, pre-manufacture, manufacture, and transport), not from the landfill itself. In 2001, San Francisco’s actions to divert materials from Altamont landfill into recycled products reduced greenhouse gas emissions from these upstream lifecycle stages by the equivalent of 768,000 tons of carbon dioxide, vs. manufacturing these same products from <b>virgin</b> <b>materials.</b> This shift away from <b>virgin</b> <b>materials</b> represents a 75-80% savings in net greenhouse gas emissions for paper, glass, copper, and steel, and a 97.5% savings for aluminum. The recycling of paper has an additional carbon sequestration effect through forest conservation. Diversion of organic material into composting also reduces greenhouse emissions, since applying compost as a soil amendment helps to sequester carbon. In this vein, San Francisco’s mandatory recycling and composting ordinance supports the city’s 2002 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Resolution to reduce emissions to 20% less than 1990 levels by no later than 2012.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study into the use of fine aggregate from construction and demolition waste (C&DW) in the South African construction industry, and the impact this has on the important fresh and hardened properties of concrete when used as partial replacement for <b>virgin</b> <b>materials.</b> The C&DW were tested at replacement levels of 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 %. The recycled fine aggregate was pre-soaked to mitigate the expected effect of higher water absorption of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). However, pre-soaking of the fines attributed to the poor performance of the fresh and hardened properties of the concrete. The pre-soaking procedure used was problematic when used with fine aggregates and caused a large amount of excess water {{to be added to the}} concrete mix as a result. This study highlights the importance of planning the demolition process of a structure to ensure that the best possible quality of RCA can be extracted. The study revealed that the use of recycled fine aggregate as a replacement of <b>virgin</b> <b>materials</b> in the manufacture of concrete has a much greater negative impact than the use of coarse recycled aggregates. In addition, the pre-soaking procedure of fine aggregates warrants special attention...|$|R
