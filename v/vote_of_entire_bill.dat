5000|$|The {{proposed}} referendum's {{scheme is}} known as the District Method (a.k.a. the Maine-Nebraska Method), which describes the process by which voters in each of the state's congressional districts select a single elector, with the two remaining electors being selected by the aggregate popular <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> the <b>entire</b> state. [...] Under the District Method, a State's electoral votes can be split among two or more candidates, just as a state's congressional delegation can be split among multiple political parties.|$|R
5000|$|The United States {{criticized the}} {{referendum}} for its [...] "lack of public debate" [...] and instances {{of one person}} casting the <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> his <b>entire</b> family. At the time, Karimov publicly stated that he considered the referendum to be a reelection to a second term, which under the Constitution would have required him to leave office in 2000.

5000|$|Title VII {{was perhaps}} the most {{controversial}} <b>of</b> the <b>entire</b> <b>bill.</b> Many conservatives accused it of advocating a de facto quota system, and claimed unconstitutionality as it attempts to regulate the workplace. Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey corrected this notion: [...] "there is nothing in VII that will give power to the Commission to require hiring, firing, and promotion to meet a racial 'quota.' [...] [...] Title VII is designed to encourage the hiring on basis of ability and qualifications, not race or religion." [...] Title VII prohibits discrimination. Humphrey was the silent hero of the bill's passing through Congress. He pledged that the bill required no quotas, just nondiscrimination. Doing so, he convinced many pro-business Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen (IL) to support Title VII.|$|R

5000|$|Incorporation {{started in}} 1897 with a takings case, {{continued}} with Gitlow v. New York (1925), {{which was a}} First Amendment case, and accelerated in the 1940s and 1950s. Justice Hugo Black famously favored the jot-for-jot incorporation <b>of</b> the <b>entire</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights. Justice Felix Frankfurter, howeverâ€”joined later by Justice John M. Harlanâ€”felt that the federal courts should only apply those sections of the Bill of Rights that were [...] "fundamental to a scheme of ordered liberty". It was the latter course that the Warren Court of the 1960s took, although {{almost all of the}} Bill of Rights has now been incorporated jot-for-jot against the states. The latest Incorporation is the 2nd Amendment which made the individual and fundamental right to [...] "keep and bear arms" [...] fully applicable to the States; see McDonald vs. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. (2010).|$|R

5|$|On April 10, 1826, Rowan {{sponsored}} {{an amendment}} to legislation to reorganize the federal judiciary that would have required seven justices to concur with a decision in order to strike down a law as unconstitutional. The amendment, which ultimately failed, was offered {{in the aftermath of}} a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States declaring an occupying claimant law to be unconstitutional; Rowan personally disagreed with the Court's decision. Rowan offered another amendment providing that ministers of the federal courts would be subject to state laws when carrying out the decisions of the federal courts. After a month <b>of</b> debate, the <b>entire</b> <b>bill</b> was tabled.|$|R
50|$|A poll {{aggregator}} is a {{web site}} that predicts upcoming U.S. federal elections by gathering and averaging pre-election polls published by others. The site predicts the winner of a presidential election and post-election composition of the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as showing who is currently ahead where and by how much. It is useful in U.S. presidential elections because the presidency {{is determined by the}} winner of state by state elections (see Electoral College), and not by simple popular <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> the <b>entire</b> nation. Editorial commentary by the site's owners and others complements the data. Interest and web traffic peak during the last few weeks before the election.|$|R
50|$|However, {{legislation}} was still {{subject to a}} <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> the <b>entire</b> House <b>of</b> Commons and this frequently led to legislation being passed despite the majority <b>of</b> Scottish MPs <b>voting</b> against. (This was especially true {{during the period of}} Conservative rule from 1979 to 1997 when the Conservative Party had an overall majority of MPs but only a handful representing Scotland and Wales.) Now that many Scottish matters are dealt with by the Scottish Parliament, the fact that MPs representing Scotland and Wales can not vote on those issues as they affect Scotland, but can vote on those same issues as they affect England is causing some disquiet.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} become a Dibando or Brother of the first degree, an {{individual}} must first have been found by the Council to be a Mikana. The individual must create a fire by friction thus creating [...] "Sacred Fire". Next he must be sunburnt to the waist in what {{is referred to as}} a [...] "Sundance". The Mikana will then be instructed to keep a fire going in the wilderness from sunset to sunrise thus completing a [...] "Vigil". He will then need to read and understand the [...] "Four Mystic Rolls".

5000|$|In 1996, the United States Congress passed, and President Bill Clinton signed, the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. This act {{allowed the}} President to veto {{individual}} items of budgeted expenditures from appropriations bills instead <b>of</b> vetoing the <b>entire</b> <b>bill</b> and sending {{it back to}} the Congress. However, this line-item veto was immediately challenged by members of Congress who disagreed with it. In 1998, the Supreme Court declared the line-item veto unconstitutional. The Court found the language of the Constitution required each bill presented to the President to be either approved or rejected as a whole. An action by which the President might pick and choose which parts of the bill to approve or not approve amounted to the President acting as a legislator instead of an executive and head of stateâ€”and particularly as a single legislator acting in place <b>of</b> the <b>entire</b> Congressâ€”thereby violating the separation of powers doctrine. (See Clinton v. City of New York, [...]) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{conflict}} {{was one of}} principles; the Culture went to war because the Idirans' fanatical imperial expansion, justified on religious grounds, threatened the Culture's [...] "moral right to exist". As the Culture saw it, the Idirans' extending sphere of influence would prevent them from improving {{the lives of those}} in less-advanced societies, and thus would greatly curtail the Culture's sense of purpose. As is the case with all major decisions, the decision {{on the part of the}} Culture to go to war was through direct <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> the <b>entire</b> population. Academics who have analysed Bank's universe in comparison with real-world political thought have remarked that the decision of the Culture to go to war was a moral choice, rather than one of necessity, as the Culture could have easily avoided war.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the initial}} 1787-88 debate over {{ratification}} of the Constitution there have been sporadic calls for the convening of a second convention to modify and correct perceived short comings in the Federal system it established.

The first method authorizes Congress, [...] "whenever two-thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary" [...] (a two-thirds of those members presentâ€”assuming that a quorum exists {{at the time that}} the vote is castâ€”and not necessarily a two-thirds <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> the <b>entire</b> membership elected and serving in the two houses of Congress), to propose Constitutional amendments.

25|$|Morse was reelected in 1950. Earlier in that year, {{he was one}} of the six Senators who {{supported}} Margaret Chase Smith's Declaration of Conscience, which criticized the tactics of McCarthyism. In protest of Dwight Eisenhower's selection of Richard Nixon as his running mate, Morse left the Republican Party in 1952. The 1952 election produced an almost evenly divided Senate; Morse brought a folding chair when the session convened, intending to position himself in the aisle between the Democrats and Republicans to underscore his lack of party affiliation. Morse expected to retain certain committee memberships but was denied membership on the Labor Committee and others. He used a parliamentary procedure to force a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> the <b>entire</b> Senate, but lost his bid. Senator Herbert Lehman offered Morse his seat on the Labor Committee, which Morse ultimately accepted.|$|R
50|$|Singel's {{loss was}} also {{attributed}} {{to the influence of}} the Reginald McFadden case. McFadden had been {{sentenced to life in prison}} in 1970 for a robbery/homicide. In 1992, the Pennsylvania Board <b>of</b> Pardons <b>voted</b> to release him. At the time, Singel, as Lt. Governor, served on the board and had <b>voted</b> in favor <b>of</b> McFadden's release. The <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> the <b>entire</b> board was 4 - 1 in favor of release. In 1994 (during the gubernatorial race), McFadden was released from prison (after Gov. Casey signed the commutation papers) and subsequently murdered two people and kidnapped and raped a third within 90 days of being released. When news of the murders broke, Singel's opponent, Tom Ridge, turned Singel's vote to release McFadden into a campaign issue. This issue, which was compared to the case of Willie Horton, was cited as another reason why Singel lost the campaign. The story of Reginald McFadden's crime spree was later the focus of an episode of This American Life.|$|R
5000|$|In late 2010 {{members of}} the Century Association [...] - [...] which had only begun admitting female members in 1989, and then by court order [...] - [...] were embroiled in a hotly contested {{internal}} debate, that involved an [...] "unusual <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> the <b>entire</b> membership". At issue was whether it [...] "should sever ties with a prestigious, all-male club in London, called the Garrick Club, that allows women to enter only {{in the company of}} men." [...] As of March 1, 2011 the reciprocity agreement was slated to end. [...] London's Daily Telegraph interviewed a Garrick Club member who said he [...] "would not be mourning the loss of his colonial cousins - or access to their facilities.

On the other side, a male Century Association member told the New York Observer that giving up infrequent visits to the Garrick Club [...] "versus condoning the discrimination of women" [...] seemed like [...] "a pretty easy trade-off".|$|R
2500|$|In the 1870s, the Icarian colony near Corning {{had another}} split. The [...] "vieux icariens" [...] were against {{allowing}} women {{the right to}} vote, but the [...] "jeunes icariens" [...] were in favor. By a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> 31â€“17, the <b>entire</b> community voted against the franchise for women. After that, the jeunes icariens {{moved to a new}} site on the same property about one mile southeast. The move was done by moving eight frame houses from the original colony. The vieux icariens community was no longer viable and was forced to disband due to bankruptcy in 1878. The new community established a new constitution in 1879.|$|R
