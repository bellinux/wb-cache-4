5|$|Physical sexual {{stimulation}} of the clitoris {{is the most common}} way for women to achieve orgasm; general statistics indicate that 70–80 percent of women require direct clitoral stimulation (consistent manual, oral or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris) to reach orgasm, though indirect clitoral stimulation (for example, via <b>vaginal</b> penetration) may also be sufficient for female orgasm. The area near the entrance of the vagina (the lower third) contains nearly 90percent of the <b>vaginal</b> nerve endings, and there are areas in the anterior <b>vaginal</b> wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the urethra that are especially sensitive, but intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, solely from <b>vaginal</b> stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because the vagina has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is {{available}} as a generic drug, for both systemic (oral and intravenous) and topical use (The exception is the <b>vaginal</b> suppository, which is not {{available as a}} generic in the USA).|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin {{preparations}} for oral administration include capsules (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and oral suspensions (containing clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride). Oral suspension is not favored for administration of clindamycin to children, {{due to its}} extremely foul taste and odor. Clindamycin is formulated in a <b>vaginal</b> cream and as <b>vaginal</b> ovules for treatment of bacterial vaginosis. It is also available for topical administration in gel form, as a lotion, and in a foam delivery system (each containing clindamycin phosphate) and a solution in ethanol (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and is used primarily as a prescription acne treatment.|$|E
5|$|Diligence in {{avoiding}} <b>vaginal</b> activity, particularly intercourse, {{after the end}} of a pregnancy (delivery, miscarriage, or abortion) or certain gynecological procedures, to ensure that the cervix closes.|$|E
5|$|Improvements of {{existing}} birth control methods are needed, as around {{half of those}} who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time. A number of alterations {{of existing}} contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a <b>vaginal</b> ring containing long-acting progesterone. This <b>vaginal</b> ring appears to be effective {{for three or four}} months and is currently available in some areas of the world. For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising.|$|E
5|$|In Nigeria, {{at least}} half a million suffer from <b>vaginal</b> fistula, {{largely as a result of}} lack of medical care. Early marriages can result in fistula.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} infections {{are related to}} intercourse, taking {{antibiotics}} afterwards may be useful. In post-menopausal women, topical <b>vaginal</b> estrogen {{has been found to}} reduce recurrence. As opposed to topical creams, the use of <b>vaginal</b> estrogen from pessaries has not been as useful as low dose antibiotics. Antibiotics following short term urinary catheterization decreases the subsequent risk of a bladder infection. A number of vaccines are in development as of 2011.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at the University of L'Aquila, using ultrasonography, {{presented}} {{evidence that}} women who experience <b>vaginal</b> orgasms are statistically {{more likely to have}} thicker tissue in the anterior <b>vaginal</b> wall. The researchers believe these findings make it possible for women to have a rapid test to confirm whether or not they have a G-spot. Professor of genetic epidemiology, Tim Spector, who co-authored research questioning the existence of the G-spot and finalized it in 2009, also hypothesizes thicker tissue in the G-spot area; he states that this tissue may be part of the clitoris and is not a separate erogenous zone.|$|E
5|$|Several {{combination}} acne treatments containing clindamycin {{are also}} marketed, such as single-product formulations of clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide—sold as BenzaClin (Sanofi-Aventis), Duac (a gel form made by Stiefel), and Acanya, among other trade names—and, in the United States, {{a combination of}} clindamycin and tretinoin, sold as Ziana. In India, <b>vaginal</b> suppositories containing clindamycin in combination with clotrimazole are manufactured by Olive Health Care and sold as Clinsup-V. In Egypt, <b>vaginal</b> cream containing clindamycin produced by Biopharmgroup sold as Vagiclind indicated for vaginosis.|$|E
5|$|Women {{are more}} prone to UTIs than men because, in females, the urethra is much shorter and closer to the anus. As a woman's {{estrogen}} levels decrease with menopause, her risk of urinary tract infections increases due to the loss of protective <b>vaginal</b> flora. Additionally, <b>vaginal</b> atrophy that can sometimes occur after menopause is associated with recurrent urinary tract infections.|$|E
5|$|Abstinence-only sex {{education}} does not reduce teenage pregnancy. Teen pregnancy rates are higher in students given abstinence-only education, {{as compared with}} comprehensive {{sex education}}. Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills). Deliberate non-penetrative sex without <b>vaginal</b> sex or deliberate oral sex without <b>vaginal</b> sex are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex {{and other forms of}} penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a <b>vaginal</b> gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause <b>vaginal</b> and rectal irritation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that G-spot and clitoral orgasms are of the same origin. Masters and Johnson {{were the first to}} determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. Upon studying women's sexual response cycle to different stimulation, they observed that both clitoral and <b>vaginal</b> orgasms had the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved <b>vaginal</b> orgasms. On this basis, Masters and Johnson argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood.|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomical}} {{structure of the}} internal organs and tissues of the female reproductive tract provides a pathway for pathogens to ascend from the vagina to the pelvic cavity thorough the infundibulum. The disturbance of the naturally occurring <b>vaginal</b> microbiota associated with bacterial vaginosis {{increases the risk of}} PID.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} site of {{recurrence}} {{is in the}} vagina; <b>vaginal</b> relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis. If relapse occurs from a cancer {{that has not been}} treated with radiation, EBRT is the first-line treatment and is often successful. If a cancer treated with radiation recurs, pelvic exenteration is the only option for curative treatment. Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation are also performed. Radiation therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local <b>vaginal</b> recurrence has a 50% five-year survival rate. Pelvic recurrences are treated with surgery and radiation, and abdominal recurrences are treated with radiation and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common recurrence sites are the pelvic lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, peritoneum (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (<1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the axial skeleton), lymph nodes outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).|$|E
5|$|<b>Vaginal</b> {{bleeding}} or spotting {{in women}} after menopause occurs in 90% of endometrial cancer. Bleeding is especially common with adenocarcinoma, occurring in {{two-thirds of all}} cases. Abnormal menstrual cycles or extremely long, heavy, or frequent episodes of bleeding in women before menopause {{may also be a}} sign of endometrial cancer.|$|E
5|$|A {{result of}} {{dysplasia}} is usually further investigated, such as {{by taking a}} cone biopsy, which may also remove the cancerous lesion. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is a possible result of the biopsy, and represents dysplastic changes that may eventually progress to invasive cancer. Most cases of cervical cancer are detected in this way, without having caused any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include <b>vaginal</b> bleeding, discharge, or discomfort.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} and excreted by acetic acid bacteria, notably the Acetobacter genus and Clostridium acetobutylicum. These bacteria are found universally in foodstuffs, water, and soil, and acetic acid {{is produced}} naturally as fruits and other foods spoil. Acetic acid {{is also a}} component of the <b>vaginal</b> lubrication of humans and other primates, where it appears to serve as a mild antibacterial agent.|$|E
5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within {{a few days}} of the impending birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act out of sync with normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. <b>Vaginal,</b> uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{barriers}} also {{protect against}} infection. The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides {{such as the}} β-defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. <b>Vaginal</b> secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often <b>vaginal</b> bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
5|$|G-spot proponents are {{criticized for}} giving too much {{credence}} to anecdotal evidence, and for questionable investigative methods; for instance, the studies which have yielded positive {{evidence for a}} precisely located G-spot involve small participant samples. While {{the existence of a}} greater concentration of nerve endings at the lower third (near the entrance) of the vagina is commonly cited, some scientific examinations of <b>vaginal</b> wall innervation have shown no single area with a greater density of nerve endings.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} {{the upper part of}} the cervix lies the bladder, {{separated}} from it by cellular connective tissue known as parametrium, which also extends over the sides of the cervix. To the rear, the supravaginal cervix is covered by peritoneum, which runs onto the back of the <b>vaginal</b> wall and then turns upwards and onto the rectum, forming the recto-uterine pouch. The cervix is more tightly connected to surrounding structures than the rest of the uterus.|$|E
5|$|Pelvic and <b>vaginal</b> {{ultrasounds}} {{are helpful}} {{in the diagnosis}} of PID. In {{the early stages of}} infection, the ultrasound may appear normal. As the disease progresses, nonspecific findings can include free pelvic fluid, endometrial thickening, uterine cavity distension by fluid or gas. In some instances the borders of the uterus and ovaries appear indistinct. Enlarged ovaries accompanied by increased numbers of small cysts correlates with PID.|$|E
5|$|Pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is an {{infection of the}} upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, <b>vaginal</b> discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect on}} sexual desire is varied, with {{increase}} or decrease in some but with no effect in most. Combined oral contraceptives {{reduce the risk of}} ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer. They often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps. The lower doses of estrogen released from the <b>vaginal</b> ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness, nausea, and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding <b>vaginal,</b> oral, and anal sex. Condom use decreases the risk somewhat. Daily antiviral medication taken {{by someone who}} has the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected, there is no cure. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject of}} the series, whose name was never released, was an {{intersex}} person with a male build and stature, but who may have self-identified as female and/or been assigned female at birth. The subject had a small, probably hypospadic, penis, rudimentary scrotum, and male pubic hair pattern. The subject also had a retracted or rudimentary clitoral hood and <b>vaginal</b> opening. In most photographs the subject's face and chest are covered.|$|E
5|$|The total medical {{cost for}} a pregnancy, {{delivery}} and {{care of a}} newborn in the United States is on average $21,000 for a <b>vaginal</b> delivery and $31,000 for a Caesarean section as of 2012. In most other countries the cost is less than half. For a child born in 2011, an average US family will spend $235,000 over 17 years to raise them.|$|E
5|$|Though {{some groups}} {{advocate}} total sexual abstinence, {{by which they}} mean the avoidance of all sexual activity, {{in the context of}} birth control the term usually means abstinence from <b>vaginal</b> intercourse. Abstinence is 100% effective in preventing pregnancy; however, not everyone who intends to be abstinent refrains from all sexual activity, and in many populations there is a significant risk of pregnancy from nonconsensual sex.|$|E
25|$|The Bartholin's glands, {{located near}} the <b>vaginal</b> opening, were {{originally}} considered the primary source for <b>vaginal</b> lubrication, but further examination showed that they provide only {{a few drops of}} mucus. The significant majority of <b>vaginal</b> lubrication is now believed to be provided by plasma seepage from the <b>vaginal</b> walls, which is called <b>vaginal</b> transudation. <b>Vaginal</b> transudation, which initially forms as sweat-like droplets, is caused by vascular engorgement of the vagina (vasocongestion), resulting in the pressure inside the capillaries increasing the transudation of plasma through the <b>vaginal</b> epithelium.|$|E
25|$|After menopause, {{the body}} {{produces}} less estrogen, which causes the <b>vaginal</b> walls {{to thin out}} significantly. The effects of menopause can lead to <b>vaginal</b> dryness (due to a decrease in <b>vaginal</b> lubrication), which causes <b>vaginal</b> discomfort on its own or discomfort or pain during sexual intercourse. This can be alleviated with hormone replacement therapy, estrogen-containing <b>vaginal</b> creams, or non-prescription, non-hormonal products, but there are risks and adverse effects associated with hormone replacement therapy.|$|E
25|$|Cervical {{cancer may be}} {{prevented}} by pap smear screening and HPV vaccines. <b>Vaginal</b> cancer is very rare, and is primarily a matter of old age; its symptoms include abnormal <b>vaginal</b> bleeding or <b>vaginal</b> discharge.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vaginal</b> {{changes that}} happen with aging and {{childbirth}} include mucosal redundancy, rounding of the posterior {{aspect of the}} vagina with shortening of {{the distance from the}} distal end of the anal canal to the <b>vaginal</b> opening, diastasis or disruption of the pubococcygeus muscles caused by poor repair of an episiotomy, and blebs that may protrude beyond the area of the <b>vaginal</b> opening. Other <b>vaginal</b> changes related to aging and childbirth are urinary incontinence, rectocele, cystocele, and stress. Similar <b>vaginal</b> and labial changes may be due to significant weight gain and subsequent loss.|$|E
25|$|Low-dose {{prescription}} <b>vaginal</b> estrogen {{products such}} as estrogen creams are generally a safe way to use estrogen topically, to help <b>vaginal</b> thinning and dryness problems (see <b>vaginal</b> atrophy) while only minimally increasing the levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|There {{can be a}} <b>vaginal</b> obstruction, such as one {{caused by}} agenesis, an {{imperforate}} hymen or, less commonly, a transverse <b>vaginal</b> septum; these cases require differentiation because surgery for them significantly varies. When there is a lump obstructing the <b>vaginal</b> opening, it is likely a Bartholin's cyst.|$|E
