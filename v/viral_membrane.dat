25|$|HIV viruses {{have only}} about 10 trimers {{on the surface}} versus some 450 for influenza. However, bNAbs can {{compensate}} by latching on to lipids {{that make up the}} <b>viral</b> <b>membrane</b> or even to sugars. bNAb loops are typically longer than ordinary antibodies, increasing the variety of epitopes they can capture. They also accumulate many mutations in the framework region that increase breadth and potency. These mutations do not compromise the antibody's stability, for unknown reasons.|$|E
25|$|For these transformations {{to lead to}} the {{eukaryotic}} cell cycle, the VE hypothesis specifies a pox-like virus as the lysogenic virus. A pox-like virus is a likely ancestor because of its fundamental similarities with eukaryotic nuclei. These include a double stranded DNA genome, a linear chromosome with short telomeric repeats, a complex membrane bound capsid, the ability to produce capped mRNA, and the ability to export the capped mRNA across the <b>viral</b> <b>membrane</b> into the cytoplasm. The presence of a lysogenic pox-like virus ancestor explains the development of meiotic division, an essential component of sexual reproduction.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we used electro-spray {{ionization}} mass-spectrometry to determine phospholipid class and molecular species compositions in bacteriophages PM 2, PRD 1, Bam 35 and phi 6 {{as well as their}} hosts. To obtain compositional data of the individual leaflets, phospholipid transbilayer distribution in the <b>viral</b> <b>membranes</b> was studied. We found that 1) the membranes of all studied bacteriophage are enriched in PG as compared to the host membranes, 2) molecular species compositions in the phage and host membranes are similar, and 3) phospholipids in the <b>viral</b> <b>membranes</b> are distributed asymmetrically with phosphatidylglycerol enriched in the outer leaflet and phosphatidylethanolamine in the inner one (except Bam 35). Alternative models for selective incorporation of phospholipids to phages and for the origins of the asymmetric phospholipid transbilayer distribution are discussed. Notably, the present data are also useful when constructing high resolution structural models of bacteriophages, since diffraction methods cannot provide a detailed structure of the membrane due to high motility of the lipids and lack of symmetric organization of membrane proteins. Lipid-containing bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) are useful models in which to study membrane assembly and lipid-protein interactions. Interpretation of high-resolution structures of these viruses require knowledge on the detailed compositions of their components. In {{this study we}} determined phospholipid class and molecular species compositions in bacteriophages PM 2, PRD 1, Bam 35 and phi 6 as well as their hosts. Quantitative electro-spray ionization mass-spectrometry was used to obtain this compositional data. In addition, the phospholipid transbilayer distribution in the <b>viral</b> <b>membranes</b> was studied {{in order to determine the}} phospholipid compositions of individual sides of these membranes. We found that 1) there is relatively more of phosphatidylglycerol in bacteriophage membranes as compared to the host membranes, but the molecular species compositions in the <b>viral</b> and host <b>membranes</b> are similar, and 2) phospholipids in the <b>viral</b> <b>membranes</b> are distributed asymmetrically with phosphatidylglycerol enriched in the outer side of the mmebrane and phosphatidylethanolamine in the inner one (except in one virus) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an antiviral small molecule, LJ 001, effective against numerous enveloped viruses including Influenza A, filoviruses, poxviruses, arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, paramyxoviruses, flaviviruses, and HIV- 1. In sharp contrast, the compound {{had no effect}} on the infection of nonenveloped viruses. In vitro and in vivo assays showed no overt toxicity. LJ 001 specifically intercalated into <b>viral</b> <b>membranes,</b> irreversibly inactivated virions while leaving functionally intact envelope proteins, and inhibited viral entry at a step after virus binding but before virus–cell fusion. LJ 001 pretreatment also prevented virus-induced mortality from Ebola and Rift Valley fever viruses. Structure–activity relationship analyses of LJ 001, a rhodanine derivative, implicated both the polar and nonpolar ends of LJ 001 in its antiviral activity. LJ 001 specifically inhibited virus–cell but not cell–cell fusion, and further studies with lipid biosynthesis inhibitors indicated that LJ 001 exploits the therapeutic window that exists between static <b>viral</b> <b>membranes</b> and biogenic cellular membranes with reparative capacity. In sum, our data reveal a class of broad-spectrum antivirals effective against enveloped viruses that target the <b>viral</b> lipid <b>membrane</b> and compromises its ability to mediate virus–cell fusion...|$|R
25|$|Gp120 is coded by the HIV env gene, {{which is}} around 2.5 kb long and codes for around 850 amino acids. The primary env product is the protein gp160, which gets cleaved to gp120 (~480 amino acids) and gp41 (~345 amino acids) in the endoplasmatic {{reticulum}} by the cellular protease furin. The crystal structure of core gp120 shows an organization with an outer domain, an inner domain {{with respect to}} its termini and a bridging sheet. Gp120 is anchored to the <b>viral</b> <b>membrane,</b> or envelope, via non-covalent bonds with the transmembrane glycoprotein, gp41.

Furthermore, IFITM proteins reduced membrane fluidity and affected membrane curvature to restrict <b>viral</b> <b>membrane</b> fusion with the cellular membrane. In addition, IFITM3 interacted with the cellular cholesterol regulatory proteins Vesicle-membrane-protein-associated protein A (VAPA) and oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) to induce intracellular cholesterol accumulation, which in turn blocked <b>viral</b> <b>membrane</b> and vesicles membrane fusion.|$|E
50|$|The {{fusion of}} the viral {{envelope}} with the cellular membrane requires high energy to occur. <b>Viral</b> <b>membrane</b> fusion proteins act as catalysts {{to overcome this}} high energy barrier. Following viral glycoprotein binding to cellular receptors, <b>viral</b> <b>membrane</b> fusion proteins undergo a change in structure conformation. This change in conformation then facilitates the destabilization and fusion of the viral envelope with the cellular membrane by allowing fusion loops (FLs) or hydrophobic fusion peptides (FPs) on the viral envelope {{to interact with the}} cell membrane. Most <b>viral</b> <b>membrane</b> fusion proteins would end up in a hairpin-like conformation after fusion, in which FLs/FPs and the transmembrane domain are all {{on the same side of}} the protein.|$|E

50|$|Since {{moving to}} Cambridge, Minson's {{research}} has focused on animal viruses, particularly those of the herpesvirus family, including herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human cytomegalovirus. These large and complex enveloped DNA viruses commonly infect humans, causing a lifelong latent infection. Conditions associated with HSV include cold sores and genital herpes, and both HSV and cytomegalovirus can be life-threatening in people who are immunodeficient. Much of Minson's research has investigated herpesvirus replication and life cycle, and viral pathogenesis and the immune response. His work has contributed to understanding the processes by which HSV fuses with the cell membrane and acquires its envelope. As of 2013, his research focuses on herpesvirus entry, in particular how the <b>viral</b> <b>membrane</b> proteins cooperate to induce fusion, as well as assembly, in particular of the <b>viral</b> <b>membrane</b> proteins.|$|E

40|$|The first {{morphological}} {{evidence of}} African {{swine fever virus}} (ASFV) assembly is the appearance of precursor <b>viral</b> <b>membranes,</b> thought to derive from the endoplasmic reticulum, within the assembly sites. We have shown previously that protein p 54, a <b>viral</b> structural integral <b>membrane</b> protein, {{is essential for the}} generation of the <b>viral</b> precursor <b>membranes.</b> In this report, we study the role of protein p 17, an abundant transmembrane protein localized at the viral internal envelope, in these processes. Using an inducible virus for this protein, we show that p 17 is essential for virus viability and that its repression blocks the proteolytic processing of polyproteins pp 220 and pp 62. Electron microscopy analyses demonstrate that when the infection occurs under restrictive conditions, viral morphogenesis is blocked at an early stage, immediately posterior to the formation of the <b>viral</b> precursor <b>membranes,</b> indicating that protein p 17 is required to allow their progression toward icosahedral particles. Thus, the absence of this protein leads to an accumulation of these precursors and to the delocalization of the major components of the capsid and core shell domains. The study of ultrathin serial sections from cells infected with BA 71 V or the inducible virus under permissive conditions revealed the presence of large helicoidal structures from which immature particles are produced, suggesting that these helicoidal structures represent a previously undetected viral intermediate.

40|$|Although {{extensively}} studied, the structure, cellular {{origin and}} assembly mechanism of internal <b>membranes</b> during <b>viral</b> infection remain unclear. By combining diverse imaging techniques, including the novel Scanning-Transmission Electron Microscopy tomography, we elucidate the structural stages of membrane biogenesis during {{the assembly of}} the giant DNA virus Mimivirus. We show that this elaborate multistage process occurs at a well-defined zone localized at the periphery of large viral factories that are generated in the host cytoplasm. Membrane biogenesis is initiated by fusion of multiple vesicles, ~ 70 nm in diameter, that apparently derive from the host ER network and enable continuous supply of lipid components to the membrane-assembly zone. The resulting multivesicular bodies subsequently rupture to form large open single-layered membrane sheets from which <b>viral</b> <b>membranes</b> are generated. Membrane generation is accompanied by the assembly of icosahedral viral capsids in a process involving the hypothetical major capsid protein L 425 {{that acts as a}} scaffolding protein. The assembly model proposed here reveals how multiple Mimivirus progeny can be continuously and efficiently generated and underscores the similarity between the infection cycles of Mimivirus and Vaccinia virus. Moreover, the membrane biogenesis process indicated by our findings provides new insights into the pathways that might mediate assembly of internal <b>viral</b> <b>membranes</b> in general...|$|R

40|$|We have {{examined}} several {{procedures for the}} reconstitution of influenza virus envelopes, based on detergent removal from solubilized <b>viral</b> <b>membranes.</b> With octylglucoside, no functionally active virosomes are formed, irrespective of the rate of detergent removal: in the final preparation the viral spike proteins appear predominantly as rosettes. Protein incorporation in reconstituted vesicles is improved when a method based on reverse-phase evaporation of octylglucoside-solubilized <b>viral</b> <b>membranes</b> in an ether/water system is employed. However, the resulting vesicles do not fuse with biological membranes, but exhibit only a non-physiological fusion reaction with negatively charged liposomes. Functional reconstitution of viral envelopes is achieved after solubilization with octaethyleneglycol mono(n-dodecyl) ether (C 12 E 8), and subsequent detergent removal with Bio-Beads SM- 2. The spike protein molecules are quantitatively incorporated in a single population of virosomes of uniform buoyant density and appear {{on both sides of}} the membrane. The virosomes display hemagglutination activity and a strictly pH-dependent hemolytic activity. The virosomes fuse with erythrocyte ghosts, as revealed by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. The rate and the pH dependence of fusion are essentially the same as those of the intact virus. The virosomes also fuse with cultured cells, either at the level of the endosomal membrane or directly with the cellular plasma membrane upon a brief exposure to low pH...|$|R
40|$|Vaccinia virus (VV) {{membrane}} biogenesis is {{a poorly}} understood process. It {{has been proposed}} that cellular membranes derived from the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) are incorporated {{in the early stages}} of virion assembly. We have recently shown that the VV 21 -kDa (A 17 L gene) envelope protein is essential for the formation of <b>viral</b> <b>membranes.</b> In the present work, we identify a 15 -kDa VV membrane protein encoded by the A 14 L gene. This protein is phosphorylated and myristylated during infection and is incorporated into the virion envelope. Both the 21 - and 15 -kDa proteins are found associated with cellular tubulovesicular elements related to the ERGIC, suggesting that these proteins are transported in these membranes to the nascent viral factories. When synthesis of the 21 -kDa protein is repressed, organized membranes are not formed but numerous ERGIC-derived tubulovesicular structures containing the 15 -kDa protein accumulate in the boundaries of the precursors of the viral factories. These data suggest that the 21 -kDa protein is involved in organizing the recruited <b>viral</b> <b>membranes,</b> while the 15 -kDa protein appears to be one of the viral elements participating in the membrane recruitment process from the ERGIC, to initiate virus formation...|$|R

50|$|It is {{probable}} that these viruses evolved before the separation of eukaryotes into the extant crown groups.

Fusion activity of virosomes was not required for MHC class H presentation of antigen.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of a hydrophilic layer covering the membrane on influenza hemagglutinin (HA) mediated fusion was investigated using membranes containing poly(ethylene-glycol) grafted phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG- 2000 -PE).
