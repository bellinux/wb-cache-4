5|$|Despite the {{profound}} advances made over recent decades {{in our understanding}} of life's fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained unresolved. One of the major unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex, and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes of meiosis and homologous recombination. One <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> sex evolved primarily as an adaptation that promoted increased genetic diversity (see references e.g.). An alternative <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> sex is an adaptation for promoting accurate DNA repair in germ-line DNA, and that increased genetic diversity is primarily a byproduct that may be useful in the long run. (See also Evolution of sexual reproduction).|$|E
5|$|In 1935 the Harvard medical {{researcher}} Hans Zinsser {{wrote the}} book Rats, Lice and History, alleging that both body and head lice transmit typhus between humans. Despite this, the modern <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> only the body louse can transmit the disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{degree to}} which Australia is and has been {{independent}} from the United Kingdom is a topic of much debate. The common <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{there has been an}} evolutionary process by which Australia has gained more and more independence.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the coelom(s) in deuterostomes and protostomes form {{by different}} process, called enterocoely and schizocoely respectively. However, research {{since the early}} 1990s has found significant exceptions. Both types of coelom construction appear among brachiopods, and therefore do not imply that brachiopods are deuterostomes.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{it is not}} {{the formal}} structure of the Council – which in theory is capable of exercising judicial, legislative and review functions – but the presence of a practically single-party Parliament that drastically undermines the PCMR's powers, restricting it solely to an advisory capacity. This may not be the case if a strong Opposition exists in Parliament to obstruct the mustering of the required two-thirds voting majority required to push through legislation without the endorsement of the Council.|$|E
5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{represents}} {{the synthesis of}} masculine and feminine energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, is inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God. The union of these principles is exalted as the root and womb of all creation. Another <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Ardhanarishvara {{is a symbol of}} Shiva's all-pervasive nature.|$|E
2500|$|One <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{state schools}} strive to admit {{students}} from [...] "all {{parts of a}} state," [...] which suggests that applicants who live farther away from a given school had {{a better chance of}} admission. But a contrary <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> geographic location of the applicant matters perhaps only slightly, if at all; Hernandez looked at acceptance ratios to Dartmouth for different geographic locations, and found <b>that</b> geographic distance <b>was</b> not a factor influencing admittances.|$|R

5|$|In {{a note on}} torsion, Thompson {{mentions}} Charles Darwin's {{treatment of}} climbing plants which often spiral around a support, noting that Darwin also observed that the spiralling stems were themselves twisted. Thompson disagrees with Darwin's teleological explanation, that the twisting makes the stems stiffer {{in the same way}} as the twisting of a rope; Thompson's <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the mechanical adhesion of the climbing stem to the support sets up a system of forces which act as a 'couple' offset from the centre of the stem, making it twist.|$|E
5|$|Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Kīlauea {{was created}} as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's {{underlying}} mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes {{are the most}} recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the -long Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. The prevailing, though not completely settled, <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, {{if not all of}} the Cenozoic Era. However, while the Hawaiian mantle plume is well understood and extensively studied, the nature of hotspots themselves remains fairly enigmatic.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1519, Zwingli {{gave his}} first sermon in Zurich. Deviating from the {{prevalent}} practice of basing a {{sermon on the}} Gospel lesson of a particular Sunday, Zwingli, using Erasmus' New Testament as a guide, began to read through the Gospel of Matthew, giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of lectio continua. He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays {{until he reached the}} end and then proceeded in the same manner with the Acts of the Apostles, the New Testament epistles, and finally the Old Testament. His motives for doing this are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor Lutheran. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model. One <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology. Another <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement. A third <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.|$|E

50|$|Jeff Riggenbach argues <b>that</b> Spencer's <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{culture and}} {{education}} made {{a sort of}} Lamarckism possible and notes <b>that</b> Herbert Spencer <b>was</b> a proponent of private charity.|$|R

5|$|Other {{molecular}} phylogenetics analyses {{agree the}} redefined Platyhelminthes are most {{closely related to}} Gastrotricha, and both {{are part of a}} grouping known as Platyzoa. Platyzoa are generally agreed to be at least closely related to the Lophotrochozoa, a superphylum that includes molluscs and annelid worms. The majority <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Platyzoa are part of Lophotrochozoa, but a significant minority of researchers regard Platyzoa as a sister group of Lophotrochozoa.|$|E
5|$|Research in 2014 by Iris Schaeffer {{into the}} underdrawings of the Dombild Altarpiece {{established}} two guiding hands, presumably Lochner and an exceptionally talented pupil, whom she concludes was in probability the principal artist behind the Heisterbach Altarpiece. A counter <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Lochner's workshop was producing to a deadline, and he delegated {{as a matter}} of expediency.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{view of a}} {{much larger}} 4th century army has fallen out of favour with some historians in more recent times, as existing evidence has been reappraised and new evidence uncovered. The revisionist <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the 4th-century army was, at its peak, roughly {{the same size as the}} 2nd-century one and considerably smaller in the late 4th century.|$|E

50|$|The {{minority}} {{judgment was}} based on the interpretation of the Act. The minority <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the majority judgment's interpretation <b>was</b> contrived, and <b>that</b> the ordinary meaning of section 7 should be accepted.|$|R
5|$|Today, the eliminativist view is {{most closely}} {{associated}} with the philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland, who deny the existence of propositional attitudes (a subclass of intentional states), and with Daniel Dennett, who is generally considered to be an eliminativist about qualia and phenomenal aspects of consciousness. One way to summarize the difference between the Churchlands's views and Dennett's <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Churchlands are eliminativists when it comes to propositional attitudes, but reductionists concerning qualia, while Dennett is an anti-reductionist with respect to propositional attitudes, and an eliminativist concerning qualia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the ontological}} {{argument}} {{may have been}} implicit {{in the works of}} Greek philosophers such as Plato and the Neoplatonists, the mainstream <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the ontological argument was first clearly stated and developed by Anselm of Canterbury. Some scholars argued that the Islamic philosopher Avicenna (Ibn Sina) developed a special kind of ontological argument before Anselm, but other scholars have doubted this position. Daniel Dombrowski marked three major stages {{in the development of the}} argument: Anselm's initial explicit formulation; the eighteenth century criticisms of Kant and Hume; and the identification of a second ontological argument in Anselm's Proslogion by twentieth century philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Emperors {{could choose}} whether to {{supervise}} the policy bureaucracy or to pursue scholarship, cults, hobbies, or women instead. However, Frederick W. Mote argues that most Song emperors – who spent much of their childhood confined and isolated within a luxurious palace – were aloof conformists detached {{from the world of}} normal affairs and thus relied on officialdom to administer the government. While the mainstream <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Song court exercised the highest degree of restraint and courtesy towards civil officials, the new protocol of enhanced deferential treatment by officials towards the emperor during conferences and meetings further eroded the emperor's close contact with his ministers.|$|E
50|$|Ash'arism is {{a school}} of {{theology}} founded in the 10th century by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari. The Asharite <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> comprehension of the unique nature and characteristics of God were beyond human capability.|$|R
5000|$|A more jaundiced <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Aronson {{had simply}} chanced upon an {{available}} domain, {{and decided to}} use it for Web art that provoked curiosity, entertained, and [...] "messed with the visitors' heads." ...|$|R

5|$|In April, Turner {{wrote in}} a self-congratulatory tone to Himmler's {{personal}} staff officer, SS-Obergruppenführer Karl Wolff, stating that he had already had all the available Jewish men killed and all {{the women and children}} placed in the Sajmište concentration camp. He went on to claim that he had arranged, {{with the help of the}} SD, a gas van to clear the camp in a period of a fortnight to four weeks. Holocaust historian Christopher Browning considers this claim suspect, stating that Turner's reports about Jewish affairs were often inaccurate and self-serving in an attempt to ingratiate himself with Hitler and shore up his position. Browning's <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a van was dispatched after regular requests from Belgrade for the remaining Jews to be deported directly, so that the local authorities could resolve the matter themselves. When the van arrived in Belgrade, Meyszner was kept informed, and Schäfer asked him for directions.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} what {{happened}} to the island's Christians after the Muslim conquest; the traditional <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> most were either converted or expelled. There is evidence from Muslim sources, however, for the continued survival of Christians on Crete, as a subject class, as in other Muslim conquests, although according to the same sources the Muslims, whether descendants of the Andalusians, more recent migrants, or converts (or any combination of these) formed the majority. There is also evidence of rival classes on the island as when Theodosius the Deacon reports that the rural Cretans, not rulers of the land but inhabitants of crags and caves, descended from the mountains under their leader Karamountes during the siege of Chandax by Nikephoros Phokas to assist the besieged. It seems that the Byzantine Christian population of the countryside was left relatively alone, while the Muslim element (including native converts) predominated in the cities.|$|E

60|$|Lloyd George's {{point of}} <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Germans could very {{properly}} pay {{a limited amount}} such as 3,912,486,782,421 marks, {{but it was not}} feasible to put on them a burden of 4,281,390,687,471 marks.|$|R
