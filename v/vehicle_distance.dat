50|$|James William Hunter of Thurston FRSE (1783-1844) was a Scottish landowner, {{inventor}} {{and agricultural}} improver.

This created a very convenient apparatus for land measurement, and is still the basis for modern day mechanical surveying odometers.

50|$|Motor oil {{changes are}} usually {{scheduled}} {{based on the}} time in service or the distance that the vehicle has traveled.These are rough indications of the real factors that control when an oil change is appropriate, which include how long the oil has been run at elevated temperatures, how many heating cycles the engine has been through, and how hard the engine has worked. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>distance</b> is intended to estimate the time at high temperature, while the time in service is supposed to correlate {{with the number of}} vehicle trips and capture the number of heating cycles. Oil does not degrade significantly just sitting in a cold engine. On the other hand, if a car is driven just for very short distances, the oil is not allowed to fully heat-up, and contaminants such as water accumulates in the oil, due to lack of sufficient heat to boil off the water. Oil of this nature, just sitting in an engine, can cause problems.|$|E

This value is capped at a maximum (currently 20) to prevent unrealistic behaviour (i.e., cutting in with zero safety headway), which means the effect is noticeable but quite subtle, when compared to the brute force method in (10). This means that as the vehicle approaches the obstacle the incentive to change lane becomes greater, reducing the appearance of congestion at the obstacle in the same lane.|$|R

50|$|Trucks {{contribute}} to air, noise, {{and water pollution}} similarly to automobiles. Trucks may emit lower air pollution emissions than cars per equivalent vehicle mass, although the absolute level per <b>vehicle</b> <b>distance</b> traveled is higher, and diesel particulate matter is especially problematic for health. EPA measures pollution from trucks. With respect to noise pollution, trucks emit considerably higher sound levels at all speeds compared to typical cars; this contrast is particularly strong with heavy-duty trucks. There are several aspects of truck operations that {{contribute to}} the overall sound that is emitted. Continuous sounds are those from tires rolling on the roadway, and the constant hum of their diesel engines at highway speeds. Less frequent noises, but perhaps more noticeable, are things like the repeated sharp-pitched whistle of a turbocharger on acceleration, or the abrupt blare of an exhaust brake retarder when traversing a downgrade. There has been noise regulation put in place to help control where and when the use of engine braking retarders are allowed.|$|E
50|$|In {{most cases}} {{guardrail}} {{would not be}} able to withstand the impact of a vehicle just by the strength of the individual posts in the area hit by the vehicle. Guardrail functions as a system with the guardrail, posts, connection of rail to the posts and to each other, and the end anchors (or terminals) all playing an integral role in how the guardrail will function upon impact. Soil conditions, height of rail, presence of curb or dike, weight of impacting <b>vehicle,</b> <b>distance</b> from back of post to hinge point and depth of post within soil can all determine how well the system will function upon impact. Guardrail is effectively one strong band that transfers the force of the vehicle to the rail elements, posts, and end terminals or anchors A run of guardrail must be anchored at each terminating end either by transitioning the rail into a fixed anchor such as a bridge rail or with an end terminal or end anchor placed in the ground or within an embankment. Newer concrete barriers, while usually strong enough to withstand direct hits by cars, still work on a similar principle in deflecting heavier vehicles such as trucks.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 In {{container}} terminal quayside operations, vehicles {{play a vital}} role in shuttling containers between the quay and the yard. The problem of determining the vehicle fleet size to employ consists of determining the exact order of moves and the vehicles to perform these moves, but due to the stochastic nature of daily operations, the planned order of moves is unlikely to be followed. The only decision that remains constant for vehicles in quayside operations is the number of vehicles to employ. Container terminal operators would benefit from analytical methods that provide feedback into how quayside operations will perform for different vehicle fleet sizes under stochastic conditions. This thesis discusses the development of an analytical method called <b>vehicle</b> <b>distance</b> threshold for providing feedback for quayside operations of {{container terminal}}s. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>distance</b> threshold provides insight into how different vehicle fleet size affects container terminal performance. In addition simulation studies are conducted to show the applicability and the robustness of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>distance</b> threshold.

This paper presents a practical nighttime <b>vehicle</b> <b>distance</b> measuring method based on a single CCD image. The method combines the image-based distance measuring system (IBDMS) with nighttime <b>vehicle</b> <b>distance</b> alarm system. To solve the nighttime feature extraction problem, the proposed method uses two taillights as the feature. Based on the proportionality of similar triangles, distance between a CCD camera and taillight of the vehicle ahead can be measured. The method focuses on detecting taillight and differentiating the targeted vehicle from others {{on the basis of}} partial image analysis instead of whole image processing. As a result, high-speed processing and simple configuration of the proposed method have been achieved as demonstrated in this paper. 1...|$|E
