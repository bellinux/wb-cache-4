40|$|In {{the past}} decades, the {{increasing}} scale of intensive pig farms led farmers to use automatic tools {{to monitor the}} welfare and health of their animals. Visual observation and manual monitoring, usually practiced in small-scale farms, is unreliable in large-scale husbandry, and is expensive and time consuming. Environmental parameters are crucial information for the efficient management of piggery buildings, as they {{have a significant effect}} on production efficiency, health and welfare of confined animals. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between pig activity and environmental parameters in a pig building by means of image analysis. The barn for 350 fattening pigs was open-space, mechanically ventilated and subdivided into 16 pens with fully slatted floor. The room was equipped to monitor the <b>ventilation</b> rate, internal <b>and</b> external <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> relative humidity every minute. For the experiments, two adjacent pens were selected, each 5. 9 by 2. 6 m, with ~ 16 pigs in each. Pigs were continuously monitored during 30 days using an infrared-sensitive CCD camera that was mounted 5 m above the floor. Recorded data were processed in real time by Eyenamic, an innovative software that continuously and automatically registers the behaviour of a group of animals, intended as the activity and occupation indices of the pigs. A preliminary virtual subdivision of the two pens in four zones (two zones for each pen) was performed to evaluate differences in activity/occupation indices in ‘front’ and ‘back’ zones of the pen. Recorded images were visually observed in the laboratory to estimate pig activity type in relation to the indices calculated by Eyenamic software. The occupation index showed higher values (up to 0. 75 units) in Zones 1 and 4 placed near the corridor. There was a significant relation between pig occupation index measured in the two pens <b>and</b> <b>ventilation</b> rate, <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> humidity. The interaction between <b>ventilation</b> <b>and</b> humidity <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> humidity significantly affected pig movements during the day. Pigs tended to stay in the part of the pen far from the external wall, where air velocity was higher, probably because this is a ‘central zone’ in the barn, characterised by a reasonable air movement (~ 0. 30 m/s). On the contrary, the part of the pen nearest to the external wall, characterised by a humid floor surface and by a limited air speed, was occupied by animals at the trough mainly during feeding times and for defecation and urination. status: publishe...|$|R

A four-span open-roof greenhouse with roof sections hinging at the gutters and opening at the ridge, constructed on the Rutgers University campus, was used for data collection. Measurements of climate conditions in the direct vicinity of the greenhouse were conducted. Using the observed outdoor and greenhouse conditions, the model parameters were calibrated statistically. The accuracy of the model and the modifications to the model are discussed by comparing the predicted <b>and</b> observed greenhouse <b>temperatures.</b> It is shown that the internal temperature rise depends on the roof configuration as well as solar radiation and wind velocity.

For the running wear jacket, non-air permeable material was assumed to eliminate the effect of porosity of the fabrics. Airflow and microclimate temperature were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The {{results showed that the}} air tended to rise and drift towards the slits. Air flown out through the slits was in the order of the lower-back slit[*]>[*]mid-back slit[*]>[*]shoulder slit. Discrepancy in the air flow rate at each slit was caused by the generation of ascending air currents according to slit positions. The direction of the air current depended on the microclimate temperature inside the jacket. These results indicate that the lower-back slit gives better air exchange effect which was in agreement with the clothing microclimate observed by human wear tests.|$|E

The building sector stands for a large part of the total energy used, e. g. for space heating and cooling, heating of domestic hot water and household electricity and there is a recent European directive related to the energy performance of buildings. The influence of occupant behaviour on the use of energy in the residential building sector has furthermore got increased attention in recent years. The overall aim of the work is to contribute to the knowledge about possible energy savings in existing Swedish apartment buildings. The more specific aim is to analyse the influence of demand controlled <b>ventilation</b> <b>and</b> room <b>temperature</b> on the heat requirements in a typical Swedish apartment building. The aim related to demand controlled ventilation is to analyse the performance of a system for Swedish apartment buildings developed as a part of the research work. The aim related to demand controlled room temperature is to analyse a novel system developed as an individual heat (or comfort) metering system. The analysis also includes a more general evaluation of individual metering. The work is strongly related to a comprehensive renovation project recently carried out by the municipal housing company Bostads AB Gårdsten. A demand controlled ventilation system is installed and evaluated in one of the buildings. The analyses related to individual metering, including demand controlled room temperature (comfort metering), are carried out using individual metering results in 255 apartments during a period of four years. The analyses show that the performance of the heating system has a major influence on the possibilities to utilise demand controlled <b>ventilation</b> <b>and</b> room <b>temperature</b> in apartment buildings.

The economic, social and environmental costs of food waste have been well documented elsewhere. This research contributes to the debate by identifying opportunities to reduce or recover food loss and waste through improved packaging. In the fresh produce sector, e. g. waste can be reduced through the use of packaging that improves product protection, <b>ventilation</b> <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> control. Other opportunities include improved design of distribution packaging to reduce damage in transport and handling; design of primary packaging to reduce waste in the home, e. g. through appropriate portion sizes and by reducing confusion over date labels; and the use of retail-ready packaging that minimizes handling and improves stock rotation in stores. An important conclusion of the study is that packaging can {{have a significant impact on}} reducing food waste in the food supply chain; and in some cases, a focus on reducing food waste will require more rather than less packaging.

As a result, the aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the thermal comfort and condensation risk for buildings with <b>ventilation</b> systems <b>and</b> cooling ceilings. The approach is based on CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) technique, introducing special methodologies in order to deal with convection and diffusion phenomena for water vapor, required for comprehensive thermal comfort analyzes and condensation mechanisms. The numerical model is applied in the case of a small office, taking into account a radiant cooling ceiling over the entire ceiling surface and two configurations of ventilation systems: mixing <b>ventilation</b> <b>and</b> displacement <b>ventilation.</b> Several simulations have been completed for different conditions concerning the air flow rates of the <b>ventilation</b> systems <b>and</b> <b>temperatures</b> of the cooling ceiling.

Moreover, noise can have an aggravating effect when combined with other potentially harmful factors in the NICU, such as ototoxic medication or stress due to other external stimuli, such as excessively bright light, lack of a day/night rhythm or pain. Sound pressure levels were measured in the NICU and inside the cribs in various experimental conditions, classified under 3 different types of sound events: constant background noise, variations in background noise and impulsive events.

Background noise and its variations concerned with activities in the department never exceeded the limits considered potentially harmful to adults (DRC), whereas the impulsive noise generated by staff on the cribs or on the plexiglas tops was considerable and potentially harmful.
