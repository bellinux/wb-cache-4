40|$|To {{characterize}} scatterometer {{returns from}} the sea surface near meteorological fronts, we investigated microwave scattering from seas in which long waves are at oblique angles to short waves. We simulate the effects of veering winds on C- and K-u-band scatterometers by using models in which the short waves align with the wind friction velocity u*, but the long waves are at oblique angles to the u* direction. The analysis reveals two main effects due to {{the rotation of the}} long wave slope probability density distribution. Azimuthally averaged normalized radar cross-section a(0) decreases as the oblique angle increases. Additionally, two regimes exist. In the small angle regime, azimuthal scans of normalized radar cross-section sigma degrees exhibit features similar to the classic double-maxima pattern for non-veering wind conditions, but the axis of sigma degrees maxima is rotated toward the long-wave axis. In the large angle regime, more than two maxima are apparent in azimuthal scans. Therefore it may be inappropriate to use standard three term Fourier cosine models for some <b>veering</b> <b>wind</b> conditions...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{capability}} of two numerical models, namely the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Cloud Resolving Storm Simulator (CReSS), to simulate the heavy rainfall that occurred on September 21, 2010 {{in the middle of}} the Korean peninsula. This event was considered part of the typical rainfall caused by intense quasi-stationary convection band, leading to a large accumulated rainfall amount within a narrow area. To investigate the relevant characteristics of this heavy rainfall and the feasibility of the numerical models to simulate them, the experiments using both numerical models were designed with a focus on Korea with a horizontal grid spacing of 2 km. The initial and later boundary conditions were interpolated using the output of the mesoscale model of Japan Meteorological Agency and integration spanned the 24 -h period from 2100 UTC on September 20, 2010 when the rainfall started in the Yellow Sea. Generally, the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the rainfall simulated by CReSS are closer than those of the WRF to the in situ observations (655 stations). The WRF simulation reveals the deficiency in capturing the unusual stagnant behavior of this event. The spatial and vertical patterns of reflectivity are consistent with the rainfall pattern, supporting that strong reflectivity coincides with the convective activity that accompanies excessive rainfall. The thermodynamic structure is the main driver of the different behavior between both simulations. The higher equivalent potential temperature, deep moist absolutely unstable layer and strong <b>veering</b> <b>wind</b> shear seen in the CReSS simulation play a role in the development of a favorable environment for inducing convection.

40|$|The authors {{conducted}} {{experiments in}} the large wind-wave tank at IRPHE to examine the influence of longer waves propagating at oblique angles to the wind direction on microwave backscattering. Measurements were made of wind, wave directional spectra, and cross sections from a 13. 5 -GHz scatterometer at 30 ° from nadir incidence angle. the authors characterize the scatterometric azimuthal scans {{with respect to the}} magnitude and the direction of the maximum backscattered power. Scans of solely wind waves are used to assess the effects of oblique waves, for which the scans yield trends that are related to the oblique-wave direction relative to the wind and the oblique-wave steepness. In particular, cross-section maxima are enhanced by oblique waves and the direction of maxima rotates from the wind axis toward the oblique-wave direction. These scatterometer data, in addition to other oblique-wave studies, led the authors to conclude that wind vectors produced from standard retrieval algorithms for scatterometers should be used with prudence in regions with significant <b>veering</b> <b>winds,</b> such as near meteorological front...|$|R
40|$|The {{first of}} four {{successive}} pulses of the 1974 explosive eruption of Fuego volcano, Guatemala, produced a small volume (∼ 0. 02 km 3 DRE) basaltic sub-plinian tephra fall and flow deposit. Samples collected within 48 h after deposition {{over much of the}} dispersal area (7 – 80 km from the volcano) have been size analyzed down to 8 φ (4 µm). Tephra along the dispersal axis were all well-sorted (σ φ[*]=[*] 0. 25 – 1. 00), and sorting increased whereas thickness and median grain size decreased systematically downwind. Skewness varied from slightly positive near the vent to slightly negative in distal regions and is consistent with decoupling between coarse ejecta falling off the rising eruption column and fine ash falling off the windblown volcanic cloud advecting at the final level of rise. Less dense, vesicular coarse particles form a log normal sub-population when separated from the smaller (Mdφ[*]<[*] 3 φ or < 0. 125 mm), denser shard and crystal sub-population. A unimodal, relatively coarse (Mdφ[*]=[*] 0. 58 φ or 0. 7 mm σ φ[*]=[*] 1. 2) initial grain size population is estimated for the whole (fall and flow) deposit. Only {{a small part of the}} fine-grained, thin 1974 Fuego tephra deposit has survived erosion to the present day. The initial October 14 pulse, with an estimated column height of 15 km above sea level, was a primary cause of a detectable perturbation in the northern hemisphere stratospheric aerosol layer in late 1974 to early 1975. Such small, sulfur-rich, explosive eruptions may substantially contribute to the overall stratospheric sulfur budget, yet leave only transient deposits, which have little chance of survival even in the recent geologic record. The fraction of finest particles (Mdφ[*]=[*] 4 – 8 φ or 4 – 63 µm) in the Fuego tephra makes up a separate but minor size mode in the size distribution of samples around the margin of the deposit. A previously undocumented bimodal–unimodal–bimodal change in grain size distribution across the dispersal axis at 20 km downwind from the vent is best accounted for as the result of fallout dispersal of ash from a higher subplinian column and a lower “co-pf” cloud resulting from pyroclastic flows. In addition, there is a degree of asymmetry in the documented grain-size fallout pattern which is attributed to vertically <b>veering</b> <b>wind</b> direction and changing windspeeds, especially across the tropopause. The distribution of fine particles (< 8 µm diameter) in the tephra deposit is asymmetrical, mainly along the N edge, with a small enrichment along the S edge. This pattern has hazard significance...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of tropical cyclogenesis (TCG), {{defined as the}} processes by which common tropical convection organizes into a coherent, self-sustaining, rapidly-rotating, and potentially destructive tropical cyclone (TC), consistently headlines research efforts but still remains largely mysterious. TCG {{has been described by}} a leading TC scientist as "one of the great remaining mysteries of the tropical atmosphere. " This dissertation was motivated by a specific case of TCG: the near-equatorial formation of a well-organized synoptic cyclonic disturbance during the active West Pacific Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). At very high resolution, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale atmospheric model proves capable of reproducing the multiscale interactions that comprise the TCG of Typhoon Chanchu. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, the synoptic observations of the incipient disturbance (i. e., weak cyclonic vortex) are compared with the results from the WRF simulation. It is found that the disturbance tilts westward with height, and as a consequence of the vertical tilt, large-scale ascent (and thus precipitation) is dynamically favored on the downtilt-right side of the vortex. A major result is that the precipitation to the north of the tilted vortex serves as an attractor to the vortex through its generation of vorticity, thereby serving to dually diminish the vertical tilt of the vortex and deflect the incipient storm northward. Observations and the model simulation both indicate that TCG commences when the storm becomes vertically upright. In the second part of the dissertation, it is shown that the simulated downtilt-right precipitation takes the form of several mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), which spawn midlevel vortices that merge with and intensify the midlevel vortex. The precipitation during the several days prior to TCG generally serves to precondition the near-vortex environment by raising the low- and midlevel humidity. Apparently, the onset of TCG can be characterized as the transition of a tilted cold-core vortex into a vertically-erect warm-core vortex. The final part of the dissertation addresses the storm-scale processes during the day of TCG. The primary point of emphasis is the vertical wind shear, which is often dismissed as detrimental to the prospect of TCG. On the contrary, it is found that the inherent vertical shear of the tilted vortex is actually the critical variable in understanding the TCG of Chanchu through its role in the vorticity tilting term. More specifically, the clockwise turning (i. e., veering) of the shear vector with height suggests a new mechanism for the rapid generation of system-scale vorticity, which current hypotheses posit as simply a stochastic amalgamation of vorticity sufficient to trigger self-intensification. The near-surface spin-up mechanism is analogous to that which occurs in supercell thunderstorms. The missing link in TCG understanding may be the dynamic implications of the <b>veering</b> <b>wind</b> profile in which the convection develops...|$|E

5000|$|The above {{atmospheric}} profile indicates several unusually favorable {{factors for}} development of severe weather, including tornadoes. One is these is significant vertical wind shear. The wind barbs on the right indicate significant speed and directional shear with height in the lower 500 mb of the atmosphere. <b>Winds</b> <b>veer</b> significantly, from SW at the surface to NW at 500 mb, and also increase from 8 kts at the surface to 46 kts at 500 mb, leading to a vertical shear value of 44 s −1. This exceeds the [...] "high potential" [...] severe weather threshold of 40 s −1. <b>Veering</b> <b>winds</b> with height indicate warm air advection; this, coupled with strong surface heating, contribute significantly to destabilization of the atmosphere. The second favorable feature on the plot is the steep vertical temperature gradient in the lower atmosphere up to the Lifted condensation level (LCL) - from 26.4 C at the surface (989 mb) to about −5 C at the LCL, which is about 600 mb. While the 600 mb height is unknown, {{it is likely that}} the atmospheric lapse rate is close to or exceeds the threshold for absolute instability, strongly driving convection. Air is therefore forced to rise rapidly, leading to a significant latent heat release (LHR), providing further energy for severe thunderstorms. Other strongly favorable conditions for severe weather are a highly negative (-6.1) lifted index (which exceeds the threshold of −6 for [...] "high potential" [...] of severe weather) and a CAPE value that peaked at 3.8 kJ, well over the threshold of 2.5 kJ for a high potential of severe weather. Vertical velocity at the surface is 13.6 m s −1, indicating strong rising motion.|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the work done}} by the Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) in developing a database of nights that experienced rapid (< 90 minutes) low cloud formation in a stable atmosphere, resulting in ceilings at the Shuttle Landing Facility (TTS) that violated Space Shuttle Flight Rules (FR). This work is {{the second phase of}} a similar AMU task that examined the same phenomena during the day. In the first phase of this work, the meteorological conditions favoring the rapid formation of low ceilings include the presence of any inversion below 8000 ft, high relative humidity (RH) beneath the inversion and a clockwise turning of the winds from the surface to the middle troposphere (- 15000 ft). The AMU compared and contrasted the atmospheric and thermodynamic conditions between nights with rapid low ceiling formation and nights with low ceilings resulting from other mechanisms. The AMU found that there was little to discern between the rapidly-forming ceiling nights and other low ceiling nights at TTS. When a rapid development occurred, the average RH below the inversions was 87 % while non-events had an average RH of 79 %. One key parameter appeared to be the vertical wind profile in the Cape Canaveral, FL radiosonde (XMR) sounding. Eighty-three percent of the rapid development events had <b>veering</b> <b>winds</b> with height from the surface to the middle troposphere (- 15, 000 ft) while 61 % of the non-events had <b>veering</b> <b>winds</b> with height. <b>Veering</b> <b>winds</b> indicate a warm-advection regime, which supports large-scale rising motion and ultimately cloud formation in a moist environment. However, only six of the nights (out of 86 events examined) with low cloud ceilings had an occurrence of rapidly developing ceilings. Since only 7 % rapid development events were observed in this dataset, it is likely that rapid low cloud development is not a common occurrence during the night, or at least not as common as during the day. In the AMU work on the daytime rapid low cloud development (Case and Wheeler 2005), nearly 30 % of the low cloud ceiling cases investigated were identified as rapidly developing events. Forecasters at the Space Meteorology Group (SMG) issue 30 to 90 minute forecasts for low cloud ceilings at TTS to support Space Shuttle landings. Mission verification statistics have shown ceilings to be the number one forecast challenge. More specifically, forecasters at SMG are concerned with any rapidly developing clouds/ceilings below 8000 R in a stable, capped thermodynamic environment. Therefore, the AMU was tasked to examine archived events of rapid stable cloud formation resulting in ceilings below 8000 ft, and document the atmospheric regimes favoring this type of cloud development. The AMU examined the cool season months of November to March during the years of 1994 - 2005 for nights that had low-level inversions and rapid, stable low cloud formation that resulted in ceilings violating the Space Shuttle FR. The AMU wrote and modified existing code to identify inversions from the evening and morning XMR radiosonde during the cool season and output pertinent sounding information. They parsed all days with cloud ceilings below 8000 ft at TTS, forming a database of possible rapidly-developing low ceiling events. Nights with precipitation or noticeable fog burn-off situations were excluded from the database. Only the nighttime hours were examined for possible ceiling development events since the daytime events were examined in the first phase of this work. The report presents one sample case of rapidly-developing low cloud ceilings. The case depicts the representative meteorological and thermodynamic characteristics of such events. The case also illustrates how quickly the cloud decks can develop, sometimes forming in 30 minutes or less. The report also summarizes the composite meteorological conditions for 6 event nights with rapid low cloud ceiling formation and 80 non-events nights consisting of advection or widespread low cloud ceilings. The teorological conditions were quite similar for both the event and non-event nights, since both types of nights experienced low cloud ceilings. Both types of nights had a relatively moist environment beneath an inversion based below 8000 ft...|$|R
