25|$|Motor car {{licences}} {{issued in}} the United Kingdom distinguish between automatic and manual transmission vehicles, {{depending on whether}} or not a driving test was passed in a vehicle with manual transmission (unless a <b>vehicle</b> <b>test</b> was taken in the UK before such distinction was made). While a manual transmission vehicle licence permits the holder to drive a vehicle of either kind, an automatic transmission vehicle licence is solely for vehicles with automatic transmission. The licence also shows whether a driver requires glasses or contact lenses to meet the legal driving requirements, if known.|$|E
25|$|Two demonstrator/prototype INNOVIA ART 100 {{cars were}} built {{and used for}} testing at the UTDC urban transit {{facility}} Millhaven, Ontario. Unlike the production cars, the demo cars lacked doors {{at either end of}} the <b>vehicle.</b> <b>Test</b> Vehicle 1 had windows in the centre and on the driver cab, while Test Vehicle 2 is a trailer car only had a centre window and no driver's cab. The paint scheme on the lead car was orange and white, while the trailer was grey and orange. The interior of the vehicle was unfinished (no seats, incomplete floor/ceiling and plywood panelling covering wiring). Only Test Vehicle 2 remained at the facility and in 2011 it was donated to the Canada Science and Technology Museum in Ottawa.|$|E

40|$|Real road <b>vehicle</b> <b>tests</b> are time consuming, laborious, and costly, {{and involve}} several safety concerns. Road vehicle motion {{simulators}} (RVMS) could assist with <b>vehicle</b> <b>testing,</b> and eliminate or reduce the difficulties traditionally associated with conducting <b>vehicle</b> <b>tests.</b> However, such simulators must exhibit {{a high level}} of fidelity and accuracy in order to provide realistic and reliable outcomes. In this paper, we review existing RVMS and discuss each of the major RVMS subsystems related to the research and development of vehicle dynamics. The possibility of utilising motion simulators to conduct ride and handling test scenarios is also investigated...|$|R
25|$|United Launch Alliance applies FSW to the Delta II, Delta IV, and Atlas V {{expendable}} launch vehicles, and {{the first}} of these with a friction stir welded Interstage module was launched in 1999. The process is also used for the Space Shuttle external tank, for Ares I and for the Orion Crew <b>Vehicle</b> <b>test</b> article at NASA as well as Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets at SpaceX. The toe nails for ramp of Boeing C-17 Globemaster III cargo aircraft by Advanced Joining Technologies and the cargo barrier beams for the Boeing 747 Large Cargo Freighter were the first commercially produced aircraft parts. FAA approved wings and fuselage panels of the Eclipse 500 aircraft were made at Eclipse Aviation, and this company delivered 259 friction stir welded business jets, before they were forced into Chapter 7 liquidation. Floor panels for Airbus A400M military aircraft are now made by Pfalz Flugzeugwerke and Embraer used FSW for the Legacy 450 and 500 Jets Friction stir welding also is employed for fuselage panels on the Airbus A380. BRÖTJE-Automation uses friction stir welding for gantry production machines developed for the aerospace sector as well as other industrial applications.|$|E
