500|$|Maunsell {{initiated}} trials with Urie N15 No.442 in 1924, {{and proved}} that better performance {{could be obtained}} by altering the steam circuit, <b>valve</b> <b>travel</b> and draughting arrangements. As a result, Clayton reduced the N15 cylinder diameter to [...] and replaced the safety valves with Ross pop valves set to [...] boiler pressure. The Urie boiler was retained, though the Eastleigh superheater {{was replaced by a}} Maunsell type with 10 per cent greater superheating surface area. This was supplemented by a larger steam chest and an increased-diameter chimney casting specially designed for the rebuilds. It incorporated a rim and capuchon to control exhaust flow into the atmosphere. Valve events (the timing of valve movements with the piston) were also revised to promote efficient steam usage and the wheels were re-balanced to reduce hammerblow.|$|E

500|$|Other {{modifications}} {{included the}} lengthening of <b>valve</b> <b>travel,</b> and fitting larger outside steam pipes {{to streamline the}} flow of steam into the cylinders. Fifteen locomotives of this revised design were built in 1927, and some were given [...] six-wheeled tenders for use on the Southern Railway's Central section. This allowed the locomotive to be turned on the shorter turntables found on {{this part of the}} network. From new, {{the rest of the class}} was equipped with the Urie [...] eight-wheel bogie tender, which allowed the class to operate on the extended freight routes of the Southern Railway's Western section. The standardisation measures undertaken by both Urie and Maunsell were soon vindicated by the fact that tenders and other parts were swapped with those of other classes on the Southern Railway when locomotives were under overhaul.|$|E
500|$|When Maunsell {{inherited}} the design as CME of the Southern Railway, he began trials using the weakest N15 (No.442) in 1924. The {{results indicated that}} better performance could be obtained by altering the steam circuit, <b>valve</b> <b>travel</b> and draughting arrangements, although the first two recommendations were deemed too costly for immediate implementation by the Locomotive Committee. Eight extra King Arthur-type boilers were ordered from North British and fitted to N15s Nos.737742 by December 1925 {{in an effort to}} improve steaming. The remaining Urie boilers were fitted with standard Ross pop safety valves to ease maintenance. Maunsell also addressed draughting problems caused by the narrow Urie [...] "stovepipe" [...] chimney. The exhaust arrangements were modified on No.737 using the King Arthur chimney design and reduced-diameter blastpipes. This proved successful, and all [...] "Urie N15s" [...] were modified over the period 19251929. The oil-burning equipment was refitted to Nos.737 and 739 during the 1926 General Strike and removed in December of that year.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} months, the two railway companies ran comparative exchange trials {{between the two}} types from which the Great Western emerged triumphant with 4079 Pendennis Castle. The LNER learned valuable lessons from the trials {{which resulted in a}} series of modifications carried out from 1926 on number 4477 Gay Crusader. Changes to the valve gear included increased lap and longer travel, in accordance with Great Western practice; this allowed fuller exploitation of the expansive properties of steam and reduced back pressure from the exhaust, transforming performance and economy; the economies in coal and water consumption achieved were such that the 180 psi Pacifics could undertake long-distance non-stop runs that had previously been impossible. There followed a complete redesign of the valve gear, which was applied to 2555 Centenary in 1927, {{with the rest of the}} class being modified in due course. Locomotives with modified valve gear had a slightly raised running plate over the cylinders in order to give room for the longer combination lever necessary for the longer <b>valve</b> <b>travel.</b> Another modification was made in 1927 when number 4480 Enterprise was fitted with a [...] boiler. This was closely followed by two other locomotives which also incorporated variations in the cylinder diameter and superheater size for comparative purposes. This led Gresley to make a radical departure from Churchward practice by increasing the number of large tubes containing superheating elements, hence increasing the superheater surface area in contact with the hot gases, thus raising steam temperature. The presence of the larger superheater could be recognised from the square covers on either side of the smokebox, a feature that the locomotives retained throughout the rest of their existence.|$|E

2500|$|Each piston transmits power {{directly}} through a connecting rod (Main rod in the US) and a crankpin (Wristpin in the US) on the driving wheel (Main {{driver in the}} US) or to a crank on a driving axle. The movement of the valves in the steam chest is controlled {{through a set of}} rods and linkages called the valve gear, actuated from the driving axle or from the crankpin; the valve gear includes devices that allow reversing the engine, adjusting <b>valve</b> <b>travel</b> and the timing of the admission and exhaust events. The cut-off point determines the moment when the valve blocks a steam port, [...] "cutting off" [...] admission steam and thus determining the proportion of the stroke during which steam is admitted into the cylinder; for example a 50% cut-off admits steam for half the stroke of the piston. The remainder of the stroke is driven by the expansive force of the steam. Careful use of cut-off provides economical use of steam and in turn reduces fuel and water consumption. The reversing lever (Johnson bar in the US), or screw-reverser (if so equipped), that controls the cut-off therefore performs a similar function to a gearshift in an automobile – maximum cut-off, providing maximum tractive effort at the expense of efficiency, is used to pull away from a standing start, whilst a cut-off as low as 10% is used when cruising, providing reduced tractive effort, and therefore lower fuel/water consumption.|$|E
50|$|An {{official}} {{test was}} conducted in 1938 to compare the steam consumption of the poppet valve Class 19C with the piston valve Class 19D. The Class 19D performed slightly better.

50|$|Diaphragm {{actuators}} {{are made}} out of a round piece of rubber and squeezed around its edges between two side of a cylinder or chamber that allows air pressure to enter either side pushing the piece of rubber one direction or the other. A rod {{is connected to the}} center of the diaphragm so that it moves as the pressure is applied.

50|$|In trailers, {{this remote}} air-supply {{is in the}} form of a tank, which is charged {{whenever}} the emergency brakes are released via the red trailer-supply valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, this tank actually receives its air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs of the tractor; the air from both of these reservoirs is merged via a two-way check valve. The two-way check valve is a pneumatic device that has two inputs and one output; each input is connected to one these reservoirs. Only the air that is at the higher pressure is allowed to pass through to the check valve's output, which then passes through the tractor-protection <b>valve,</b> and then <b>travels</b> onward towards the trailer's air-tank and spring brake valve via the red trailer-supply line (a.k.a., the emergency line); this releases the trailer's emergency brakes (a.k.a. spring brakes). The tractor-protection valve is a device that prevents air from being lost from the tractor's braking system in the event of the air-lines becoming separated or broken. The tractor's air-lines connect to the trailer's air-lines via metal connectors known as gladhands. The merged air from both reservoirs of the tractor prevents air-loss from only one tractor braking circuit from causing the trailer's spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location, such as in the middle of an intersection.|$|R
