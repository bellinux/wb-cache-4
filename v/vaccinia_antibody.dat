40|$|The {{effect of}} {{unheated}} guinea pig and human prevaccination serum on the neutralization of vaccinia virus was studied. Enhancement of neutralization {{was found in}} all sera containing antibody and was more marked (20 - to 150 -fold) in sera obtained in the first weeks after primary vaccination than in sera from immune adults or cord sera (4 - to 25 -fold). The enhancing factor {{was thought to be}} complement because it was destroyed by heating and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid treatment. The fresh serum-enhanced neutralization test represents a highly sensitive and specific test which can be applied to measure low levels of <b>vaccinia</b> <b>antibody</b> not detectable by other means...|$|E
40|$|A 17 {{year old}} girl died after an illness {{characterized}} by progressive mental deterioration and severe myoclonic jerks. Extensive pathological, virological, and immunological studies failed {{to support the}} diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis but were compatible with disseminated demyelinating disease. The spinal fluid was positive for measles virus antibodies when examined by the fluorescent antibody technique, by complement fixation, and by haemagglutination inhibition tests, but the antibody titres were not high. The concentration of <b>vaccinia</b> <b>antibody</b> in the serum was consistent with that found {{in the general population}} and none was detected in the spinal fluid. Animal and tissue culture studies failed to disclose a viral agent, but pathological sections revealed perivascular cellular infiltration, demyelination, rare inclusion bodies, and multinucleated giant cells. Although these studies were not definitive, a record of procedures used and results obtained, both positive and negative, may be helpful to other investigators interested in defining more accurately the clinical features and the pathogenesis of these diseases...|$|E
40|$|Ectromelia virus, an orthopoxvirus {{that can}} cause {{extensive}} morbidity and mortality (mousepox) in colonized mice, has been epizootically responsible for serious disruption of biomedical research since 1930. The lack of a sensitive and specific serological assay for infection with this virus became apparent during outbreaks of mousepox at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., and other biomedical research institutions in 1979 and 1980. To fill this need, we evaluated an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sucrose gradient-purified ectromelia and vaccinia viruses were compared as antigens in tests on approximately 1, 000 mouse sera from experimentally infected mice and conventional colonies of uninfected mice. A statistical analysis based on the frequency distribution of the absorbance values for 152 mouse sera (free of ectromelia antibody) gave 0. 22 as a value to differentiate ectromelia-positive sera from ectromelia-negative sera. When enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results were compared with those obtained by an indirect immunofluorescence assay, the former {{was found to be}} at least 10 -fold more sensitive. With the procedures employed, including the use of purified vaccinia virions as antigen, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay proved to be highly sensitive and specific for detecting antibodies to ectromelia and vaccinia viruses. False-positive results were not encountered. False-negative results were observed in 3 % of 108 separate tests of a known positive serum. Although data indicated that ectromelia antibody can be differentiated from <b>vaccinia</b> <b>antibody</b> with homologous and heterologous antigen, this procedure probably cannot be generally used because of unavailability of ectromelia antigens...|$|E
40|$|A hemagglutination-inhibition {{test for}} the {{determination}} of <b>vaccinia</b> <b>antibodies</b> in serum was first described by Nagler. 5 It has been used extensively by us in a standardized form. 2 Collier 8 has utilized a modification of the method {{in his study of}} adults. The present report deals with the determination of the titre of <b>vaccinia</b> <b>antibodies</b> in the sera of 182 mothers at term and in the cord blood of their newborn offsprings. Of the mothers, 102 had been vaccinated within the past five years, while 80 had been vaccinated more than five years ago. METHODS A standardized procedure of determining <b>vaccinia</b> hemagglutination-inhibition <b>antibodies</b> in serum has been described previously. 2 A suspension of vaccinia-infected allantoic membranes is used as the antigen. Fowl cells susceptible to hemagglutination with the vaccinia-variola group of viruses are utilized in a concentration of 0. 5 per cent in Alsever's solution. A single hemagglutinating unit is defined as that dilution of the antigen which produces definite hemagglutination of 0. 25 cc. of a 0. 5 per cen...|$|R
40|$|A {{radioimmunoassay}} {{procedure was}} developed for determining smallpox and <b>vaccinia</b> <b>antibodies</b> in human sera. The test detected and measured both primary and secondary immune responses in persons infected with variola virus or <b>vaccinia</b> virus. The <b>antibody</b> titers obtained by complement fixation, hemagglutination inhibition, plaque reduction neutralization, and radioimmunoassay methods were compared. In sequential serum specimens, the radioimmunoassay test indicated fourfold or greater increases {{in all of the}} smallpox patients and in six of eight vaccinated persons. Both the complement fixation and the hemagglutination inhibition tests were less effective. In persons who had been vaccinated, radioimmunoassay and plaque reduction neutralization tests appeared to measure the same immune response. However, in smallpox patients the immune response was readily detected by radioimmunoassay, whereas an immune response was not detected by the plaque reduction neutralization test when vaccinia virus was the antigen in the test system. Radioimmunoassay is an operationally simple procedure which provides objective and quantitative end-point titers in serological determinations...|$|R
40|$|Background. Identifying genetic {{factors that}} {{influence}} poxvirus immunity across races may assist {{in the development of}} better vaccines and approaches for vaccine development. Methods. We performed an extensive candidate-gene genetic screen (across 32 cytokine and cytokine receptor genes) in a racially diverse cohort of 1056 healthy adults after a single dose of smallpox vaccine. Associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) /haplotypes and <b>vaccinia</b> virus–specific neutralizing <b>antibodies</b> were assessed using linear regression methodologies. Results. The combined analysis identified 63 associations between candidate SNPs and antibody levels after smallpox vaccination with P,. 05. Thirty-one of these were within the IL 18 R 1 and IL 18 genes. Five IL 18 R 1 SNPs, including a coding synonymous polymorphism rs 1035130 (Phe 251 Phe) and 2 promoter SNPs (rs 6710885, rs 2287037), all in linkage disequilibrium, were associated with significant variations in antibody levels in both Caucasians (P #. 016) and African Americans (P #. 025). Similarly, associations with 2 intronic IL 18 SNPs (rs 2043055 and rs 5744280) were consistent in the Caucasian (P #. 023) and African American samples (P #. 014). Haplotype analysis revealed highly significant associations between IL 18 R 1 haplotypes and <b>vaccinia</b> virus–specific <b>antibody</b> levels (P,. 001, by combined analysis) that were consistent across races. Conclusions. Our study provides evidence for IL 18 and IL 18 R 1 genes as plausible genes regulating the humora...|$|R
40|$|Of all the {{microorganisms}} and toxins, poxviruses (Orthopoxvirus) {{have the}} greatest potential for use by terrorists. These viruses can spread rapidly through the environment following initial infection. In 1980, the World Health Organization Eradication Program discontinued vaccination for smallpox and declared that the disease had been eliminated. With the threat of smallpox virus as a bioterrorism weapon, questions have been asked about the persistence of protection (as offered by antibodies) following vaccination with vaccinia virus vaccine. To address this, sera from 204 adults vaccinated as children were tested by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) {{for the presence of}} vaccinia virus antibody. Of the 204 individuals whose sera were examined for the presence of <b>vaccinia</b> <b>antibody,</b> 165 (80. 9 %) had been vaccinated once and 39 (19. 1 %) had been vaccinated at least twice. Of the 165 sera from individuals vaccinated once, 112 (67. 9 %) were positive. Of the 39 sera from individuals vaccinated more than once, 31 (79. 5 %) were positive. The presence of a vaccination scar at the time of blood collection was not determined. Fifty-six nonvaccinated individuals, under 30 years of age, were tested by EIA; four of these (7. 1 %) were positive for vaccinia virus antibody by EIA. Forty-four EIA-positive and 16 EIA-negative sera were also tested by serum neutralization (SN) as a comparison with the EIA test results; one serum (negative by EIA) was SN positive. No attempt was made to ascertain any demographics other than age (date of birth) and “remembered” times of vaccination...|$|E
40|$|Modified Vaccinia {{virus has}} been shown to be a safe and {{immunogenic}} vector platform for delivery of HIV vaccines. Use of this vector is of particular importance to the military, with the implementation of a large scale smallpox vaccination campaign in 2002 in active duty and key civilian personnel in response to potential bioterrorist activities. Humoral immunity to smallpox vaccination was previously shown to be long lasting (up to 75 years) and protective. However, using vaccinia-vectored vaccine delivery for other diseases on a background of anti-vector antibodies (i. e. pre-existing immunity) may limit their use as a vaccine platform, especially in the military. In this pilot study, we examined the durability of <b>vaccinia</b> <b>antibody</b> responses in adult primary vaccinees in a healthy military population using a standard ELISA assay and a novel dendritic cell neutralization assay. We found binding and neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses to vaccinia waned after 5 - 10 years in a group of 475 active duty military, born after 1972, who were vaccinated as adults with Dryvax®. These responses decreased from a geometric mean titer (GMT) of 250 to baseline (30 years with a GMT of 210 (range 112 - 3234). This data suggests limited durability of antibody responses in adult vaccinees compared to those vaccinated in childhood and further that adult vaccinia recipients may benefit similarly from receipt of a vaccinia based vaccine as those who are vaccinia naïve. Our findings may have implications for the smallpox vaccination schedule and support the ongoing development of this promising viral vector in a military vaccination program...|$|E

The gene has been expressed in recombinant vaccinia virus and the gene product recognized by monoclonal antibodies and human immune sera. Rabbits immunized with the recombinant <b>vaccinia</b> virus produced <b>antibodies</b> that immunoprecipitate gB from HCMV-infected cells and neutralize HCMV infectivity in vitro.

40|$|AbstractInterleukin 17 (IL- 17) is a newly {{identified}} cytokine {{that has}} a homolog in herpesvirus saimiri. We inserted murine IL- 17 into vaccinia virus to study the role of IL- 17 in viral infection. Vaccinia virus expressing IL- 17 (vv-IL 17) and its parental control virus (vv-pRB) grew to similar titers in vitro; however, vv-IL 17 was more virulent in mice with a threefold lower LD 50 than for vv-pRB, and mean time to death of 2. 8 days versus 4. 5 days. Mice infected with vv-IL 17 had higher titers of virus in the ovaries (P < 0. 02) and showed a decrease in NK cell cytotoxicity (P < 0. 02) on day 3 after infection. No {{significant difference was found}} in CTL activity. In addition, a significant decrease in IgG 2 a (P < 0. 01) and increases in IgG 1, IgG 3, and IgA (P < 0. 03) <b>vaccinia</b> virus-specific <b>antibody</b> titers were observed in mice infected with vv-IL 17 versus vv-pRB, suggesting a Th- 2 -like response to infection.

40|$|Vaccinia {{virus is}} being {{investigated}} as a replicating vector for tumor-directed gene therapy. However, the majority of cancer patients have preformed immunologic reactivity against vaccinia virus, {{as a result of}} smallpox vaccination, which may limit its use as a vector. The Yaba-like disease (YLD) virus was investigated here as an alternative, replicating poxvirus for cancer gene therapy. We have demonstrated that the YLD virus does not cross-react with <b>vaccinia</b> virus <b>antibodies,</b> and it replicates efficiently in human tumor cells. YLD virus can be expanded and purified to high titer in CV- 1 cells under conditions utilized for vaccinia virus. The YLD virus RNA polymerase was able to express genes regulated by a synthetic promoter designed for use in orthopoxviruses. We sequenced the YLD virus TK gene and created a shuttle plasmid, which allowed the recombination of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene into the YLD virus. In a murine model of ovarian cancer, up to 38 % of cells in the tumor expressed the GFP transgene 12 days after intraperitoneal virus delivery. YLD virus has favorable characteristics as a vector for cancer gene therapy, and this potential should be explored further...|$|R
40|$|Th e {{incidence}} of poxvirosis, a zoonosis caused by viruses {{of the family}} Poxviridae, has increased {{over the past two}} decades in Brazil. Th e important features of the Orthopoxvirus infection include rapid spread, occurrence restricted to lactating cows, lack of hygiene, person-to-person spread, and occurrence at properties where milking is conducted. We detected the presence of <b>vaccinia</b> virus <b>antibodies,</b> specifi cally for Cantagalo virus, in samples from two distinct populations from the state of Rio de Janeiro: (i) healthy professionals who live in the State of Rio de Janeiro and handle animals and (ii) in patients with cutaneous lesions compatible with poxvirosis. Th e plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) was used. Of the 136 samples from the group of healthy professionals, 12 displayed seroreactivity with titres lower than or equal to 1 / 10. Anti-poxvirus antibodies were detected in 68. 3 % of samples of patients suspected to be infected with poxvirus (28 / 41). Th erefore, the plaque reduction neutralisation test constitutes a sensitive assay that can be more commonly used for diagnosis.

40|$|Complement-dependent {{antibody}} lysis of vaccinia-infected cells {{was examined}} {{to demonstrate the}} antigenic differences between extracellular (ECV) and intra-cellular (ICV) forms of <b>vaccinia</b> virus. Cytolytic <b>antibodies</b> present in the antisera raised against ECV or live virus (LV) were completely removed by absorption with infected cell membranes or purified ECV but not with purified ICV. Absorption with infected cell membranes also abolished the neutralizing activity of ECV and LV antisera against ECV. On the other hand, antiserum against ICV did not contain cytolytic antibodies against vaccinia-infected cells, even though its neutral-izing antibody titre against ICV was high. Moreover, both ECV and |CV anti-sera neutralized {{a small proportion of}} the heterologous form of virus, despite using purified preparations of ECV and ICV, respectively, for raising these anti-sera in rabbits. In contrast, the 51 Cr release test only detected the antibodies against ECV and thus can be used to differentiate between the antibody activity of a serum against ECV and ICV...|$|R
40|$|A cDNA copy of {{the gene}} coding for the major outer {{neutralizing}} protein (VP 7) of simian 11 rotavirus was incorporated into the vaccinia virus genome {{under the control of}} the vaccinia promoter (molecular weight, 7, 500).

40|$|The {{smallpox}} vaccine is the prototypic vaccine, yet the viral targets critical for vaccine-mediated protection remain unclear in humans. We have produced protein microarrays of a near-complete vaccinia proteome {{and used them}} to determine the major antigen specificities of the human humoral immune response to the {{smallpox vaccine}} (Dryvax). H 3 L, an intracellular mature virion envelope protein, was consistently recognized by high-titer antibodies {{in the majority of}} human donors, particularly after secondary immunization. We then focused on examining H 3 L as a valuable human antibody target. Purified human anti-H 3 L <b>antibodies</b> exhibited substantial <b>vaccinia</b> virus-neutralizing activity in vitro (50 % plaque reduction neutralization test [PRNT 50] = 44 μg/ml). Mice also make an immunodominant antibody response to H 3 L after vaccination with vaccinia virus, as determined by vaccinia virus protein microarray. Mice were immunized with recombinant H 3 L protein to examine H 3 L-specific antibody responses in greater detail. H 3 L-immunized mice developed high-titer <b>vaccinia</b> virus-neutralizing <b>antibodies</b> (mean PRNT 50 = 1 : 3, 760). Importantly, H 3 L-immunized mice were subsequently protected against lethal intranasal challenges with 1 or 5 50 % lethal doses (LD 50) of pathogenic vaccinia virus strain WR, demonstrating the in vivo value of an anti-H 3 L response. To formally demonstrate that neutralizing anti-H 3 L antibodies are protective in vivo, we performed anti-H 3 L serum passive-transfer experiments. Mice receiving H 3 L-neutralizing antiserum were protected from a lethal challenge with 3 LD 50 of vaccinia virus strain WR (5 / 10 versus 0 / 10; P < 0. 02). Together, these data show that H 3 L is a major target of the human anti-poxvirus antibody response and {{is likely to be a}} key contributor to protection against poxvirus infection and disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{smallpox}} vaccine Dryvax, {{which consists of}} replication-competent <b>vaccinia</b> virus, elicits <b>antibodies</b> that {{play a major role}} in protection. Several vaccinia proteins generate neutralizing antibodies, but their importance for protection is unknown. We investigated the potency of antibodies to the A 27 protein of the mature virion in neutralization and protection experiments and the contributions of A 27 antibodies to Dryvax-induced immunity. Using a recombinant A 27 protein (rA 27), we confirmed that A 27 contains neutralizing determinants and that vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) derived from Dryvax recipients contains reactivity to A 27. However, VIG neutralization was not significantly reduced when A 27 antibodies were removed, and antibodies elicited by an rA 27 enhanced the protection conferred by VIG in passive transfer experiments. These findings dem-onstrate that A 27 antibodies do not represent the major fraction of neutralizing activity in VIG and suggest that immunity may be augmented by vaccines and immune globulins that include strong antibody responses to A 27. The threat of bioterrorism has stimulated new {{smallpox vaccine}} initiatives. Although the US-licensed smallpox vaccine Dryvax (Wyeth Laboratories) composed of rep-lication-competent vaccinia virus (VACV) is highly ef...|$|R
40|$|Background. Genetic {{association}} studies {{demonstrated a}} role for cytokine proteins and cytokine or cytokine re-ceptor gene polymorphisms in smallpox vaccine–induced adaptive immunity. Methods. We examined the association of genetic polymorphisms with cellular (interferon [IFN] γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay [ELISPOT]) immune response to smallpox vaccine in 1076 immunized individuals. Results. The majority of significant associations were discovered between single-nucleotide polymorphisms/ haplotypes in IL 18 R 1 and IL 18 genes, in which we previously reported an association with <b>vaccinia</b> virus–induced neutralizing <b>antibody</b> titers in this study cohort. A functional coding IL 18 R 1 polymorphism (rs 1035130 /Phe 251 Phe; P =. 01) {{was significantly associated with}} an allele dose-related increase in IFN-γ production and was also asso-ciated with vaccinia-specific neutralizing antibody titers. Significant associations were also found between IL 18 R 1 haplotypes and variations in IFN-γ ELISPOT responses (global P <. 0001). Conclusions. Our data suggest the importance of variants in the IL 18 R 1 and IL 18 genetic loci for broad-based smallpox vaccine–induced adaptive immunity. Keywords.

40|$|Previous studies {{demonstrated}} that <b>antibodies</b> to live <b>vaccinia</b> virus infection {{are needed for}} optimal protection against orthopoxvirus infection. The present report {{is the first to}} compare the protective abilities of individual and combinations of specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies that target proteins of the intracellular (IMV) and extracellular (EV) forms of <b>vaccinia</b> virus. The <b>antibodies</b> were directed to one IMV membrane protein, L 1, and to two outer EV membrane proteins, A 33 and B 5. In vitro studies showed that the antibodies to L 1 neutralized IMV and that the antibodies to A 33 and B 5 prevented the spread of EV in liquid medium. Prophylactic administration of individual antibodies to BALB/c mice partially protected them against disease following intranasal challenge with lethal doses of vaccinia virus. Combinations of antibodies, particularly anti-L 1 and -A 33 or -L 1 and -B 5, provided enhanced protection when administered 1 day before or 2 days after challenge. Furthermore, the protection was superior to that achieved with pooled immune gamma globulin from human volunteers inoculated with live vaccinia virus. In addition, single injections of anti-L 1 plus anti-A 33 antibodies greatly delayed the deaths of severe combined immunodeficiency mice challenged with vaccinia virus. These studies suggest that antibodies to two or three viral membrane proteins optimally derived from the outer membranes of IMV and EV, may be beneficial for prophylaxis or therapy of orthopoxvirus infections...|$|R
