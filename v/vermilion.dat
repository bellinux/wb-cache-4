5|$|Reid's {{political}} career began with {{four years on}} the municipal council of Buffalo Coulee, around present-day <b>Vermilion.</b> He spent two of these as Reeve. He was instrumental in founding the <b>Vermilion</b> municipal hospital district, on whose board he served for many years. Federally, he was active with the United Farmers of Alberta Battle River Political Association, of which he became president.|$|E
5|$|Mercury {{occurs in}} {{deposits}} {{throughout the world}} mostly as cinnabar (mercuric sulfide). The red pigment <b>vermilion</b> is obtained by grinding natural cinnabar or synthetic mercuric sulfide.|$|E
5|$|Michelangelo used {{a limited}} palette of {{pigments}} comprising lead white, azurite, verdigris and few others. He avoided ochres and used very little <b>vermilion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{found at}} <b>Vermilion</b> Lakes indicates {{the first human}} activity in Banff to 10,300 B.P. Prior to European contact, aboriginals, including the Stoneys, Kootenay, Tsuu T'ina, Kainai, Peigans, and Siksika, resided in the region where they hunted bison and other game.|$|E
5|$|Barrons co-authored a book, The Business General, {{published}} by <b>Vermilion,</b> with Deborah Tom in 2006. He has also lectured {{as a guest}} speaker, including at the University of Oxford. As of 2010, Barrons {{was chairman of the}} Royal Artillery Museum.|$|E
5|$|El Greco painted {{many of his}} {{paintings}} on fine canvas and employed a viscous oil medium. He painted with the usual pigments of his period such as azurite, lead-tin-yellow, <b>vermilion,</b> madder lake, ochres and red lead, but he seldom used the expensive natural ultramarine.|$|E
5|$|Larger {{local economies}} in the more populous {{counties}} {{to the east and}} west offer additional employment and commerce, particularly in the cities of Lafayette and West Lafayette in Tippecanoe County and the city of Danville in <b>Vermilion</b> County, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|On January 25, five {{government}} witnesses testified, including Dr. Quidor and the Leetes' {{mother and}} sister. Quidor {{testified that he}} had discovered blood on a ball of twine, although it had been painted over with <b>vermilion.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{thorough}} technical investigation {{including a}} pigment analysis of Las Meninas was conducted around 1981 in Museo Prado. The analysis revealed the usual pigments of the baroque period frequently used by Velázquez {{in his other}} paintings. The main pigments used for this painting were lead white, azurite (for the skirt of the kneeling menina), <b>vermilion</b> and red lake, ochres and carbon blacks.|$|E
5|$|In Chinese astronomy, {{the stars}} of Corvus are located within the <b>Vermilion</b> Bird of the South (南方朱雀, Nán Fāng Zhū Què). The four main stars depict a chariot, Zhen, which is the 28th and final lunar mansion; Alpha and Eta mark the linchpins for the wheels, and Zeta is Changsha, a coffin. In Indian astronomy, the five main stars of Corvus {{represent}} a hand or fist corresponding to the Hastā, the 13th nakshatra or lunar mansion.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} has been positively received by series fans in Japan. In a popularity contest for {{the characters of}} Drakengard 3, Zero came in as the fourth most popular character of the game, with her dragon Mikhail taking first place. In the 2014 Dengeki PlayStation Awards, Zero was placed as the fourth best character of 2013. Beyond the Drakengard universe, both Zero had her dragon Mikhail appeared in the second sequel to the arcade game Lord of <b>Vermilion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{main bar}} {{was large and}} black, with black and white zebra-patterned {{wallpaper}} {{on the walls of}} the room. An indoor waterfall surrounded by imitation exotic vegetation stood in the back. The club's main showroom, the <b>Vermilion</b> Room, often featured the likes of Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and the slapstick comedy duo of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 {{he had studied}} under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore {{it is likely that}} White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of turpentine and <b>vermilion,</b> after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and <b>vermilion.</b> The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} was not recorded, {{but it probably}} involved replacing the blood {{with a mixture of}} turpentine and <b>vermilion.</b> The body was then put in an old clock case and stored in the house of Beswick's family physician, Dr Charles White. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a local celebrity, and visitors were allowed to view her at White's house.|$|E
5|$|The state's iron-mining {{industry}} was established {{with the discovery}} of iron in the <b>Vermilion</b> Range and the Mesabi Range in the 1880s, and in the Cuyuna Range in the early 20th century. The ore was shipped by rail to Duluth and Two Harbors, then loaded onto ships and transported eastward over the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide range}} of {{habitats}} in the park supports a diverse population of birds including some, such as the <b>vermilion</b> flycatcher and the whiskered screech owl, uncommon elsewhere in the United States. Among the park's 107 bird species are great horned owls, cactus wrens, ravens, kestrels, turkey vultures, roadrunners, woodpeckers, hawks, quails, and hummingbirds, and one threatened species, the Mexican spotted owl.|$|E
5|$|As Bob moved {{towards the}} U.S. Gulf Coast, the National Weather Service issued gale {{warnings}} for coastal regions extending from <b>Vermilion</b> Bay, Louisiana to Biloxi, Mississippi at 1600 UTC on July 10. These warnings were upgraded to hurricane warnings upon Bob's strengthening {{to such an}} intensity. During the storm's existence, forecasts and predictions from the National Hurricane Center were of greater accuracy than on average. In addition to tropical cyclone warnings and watches, the agency also advised small craft from Port Arthur, Texas to Pensacola, Florida to remain in port.|$|E
5|$|As the Recovery Program {{achieved}} milestones, a fifth active {{release site}} in Sierra de San Pedro Mártir National Park, Baja California, Mexico, {{was added to}} the three release sites in California (Big Sur, Pinnacles National Park and Bitter Creek National Wildlife Refuge) and the <b>Vermilion</b> Cliffs release site in Arizona. In early 2007, a California condor laid an egg in Mexico {{for the first time since}} at least the 1930s. The population of the condors has risen due to these wild and also captive nestings.|$|E
5|$|As the greenstone belts were forming, volcanoes ejected tephra {{into the}} air which settled as sediments to become {{compacted}} into the greywackes and mudstones of the Knife Lake and Lake <b>Vermilion</b> formations. Greywackes are poorly sorted mixtures of clay, mica and quartz that may be derived from the decomposition of pyroclastic debris; {{the presence of this}} debris suggests that some explosive volcanic activity had occurred in the area earlier. The volcanism took place on the surface and the other deformations took place at various depths. Numerous earthquakes accompanied the volcanism and faulting.|$|E
5|$|Before {{his final}} {{undergraduate}} year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer {{teaching at the}} Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near <b>Vermilion,</b> Alberta. The experience gave him {{a sense of the}} vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one, but that it went the deepest.|$|E
5|$|Born near Glasgow, Reid {{worked a}} number of jobs as a young adult—including wholesaler, army medic (during the Second Boer War), farmhand, lumberjack, and dentist—and immigrated to Canada in 1903. He {{involved}} himself in local politics and joined the recently formed UFA, which nominated him {{to run in the}} 1921 provincial election as its candidate in <b>Vermilion.</b> The UFA won the election, and Reid served in several capacities in the cabinets of Premiers Herbert Greenfield and John Edward Brownlee, where he established a reputation for competence and fiscal conservatism. When a sex scandal forced Brownlee from office in 1934, Reid was the caucus' unanimous choice to succeed him as Premier.|$|E
5|$|Géricault {{painted with}} small brushes and viscous oils, which allowed {{little time for}} {{reworking}} and were dry by the next morning. He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of <b>vermilion,</b> white, naples yellow, two different yellow ochres, two red ochres, raw sienna, light red, burnt sienna, crimson lake, Prussian blue, peach black, ivory black, cassel earth and bitumen. Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but {{over a period of}} time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated. As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the first}} {{description}} of a Dimetrodon fossil came a year earlier, when Cope named the species Clepsydrops limbatus from the Texas Red Beds. (The name Clepsydrops was first coined by Cope in 1875 for sphenacodontid remains from <b>Vermilion</b> County, Illinois, and was later employed for many sphenacontid specimens from Texas; many new species of sphenacodontids from Texas were assigned to either Clepsydrops or Dimetrodon {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries.) C.limbatus was reclassified as a species of Dimetrodon in 1940, meaning that Cope's 1877 paper was the first record of Dimetrodon.|$|E
5|$|Reid was {{nominated}} as the UFA candidate in <b>Vermilion</b> during the 1921 provincial election, {{the first in}} which the UFA ran candidates. The Legislative Assembly of Alberta was dominated by the Liberals, who had governed Alberta since its creation in 1905. To Reid's great surprise, he defeated his Liberal opponent and {{was elected to the}} legislature, along with 37 of his fellow UFA candidates—enough to form a majority government. He chaired the first meeting of the new UFA caucus, at which it selected Herbert Greenfield as Premier. Reid was re-elected in the 1926 and 1930 elections.|$|E
5|$|The Kootenay rises on the {{northeast}} slopes of the Beaverfoot Range of southeastern British Columbia, and flows initially southeast through the valleys of Kootenay National Park. Its first few kilometers (miles) are quiet, threading slowly {{through a series of}} marshes and small lakes. The river becomes significantly enlarged as it reaches the confluence with the <b>Vermilion</b> River, which is actually the larger of the two where they meet near the settlement of Kootenay Crossing. It continues southeast, receiving the Palliser River from the left, and swings southwards into a gorge at the confluence with the White River.|$|E
5|$|The National Weather Service Central Illinois is {{in charge}} of weather forecasts, {{warnings}} and local statements for 35 counties in Central and Southeastern Illinois: Cass, Champaign, Christian, Clark, Clay, Coles, Crawford, Cumberland, De Witt, Douglas, Edgar, Effingham, Fulton, Jasper, Knox, Lawrence, Logan, McLean, Macon, Marshall, Mason, Menard, Morgan, Moultrie, Peoria, Piatt, Richland, Sangamon, Schuyler, Scott, Shelby, Stark, Tazewell, <b>Vermilion,</b> and Woodford. In addition the office {{is in charge}} of aviation forecasts for five regional airports, Peoria, Springfield, Decatur, Champaign and Bloomington/Normal.|$|E
5|$|The {{designs of}} most of these flags have been {{modified}} only {{to adjust to the}} changes in the official rendering of the national coat of arms. Major modifications included a change in the stylization of the eagle from Neoclassicist to Baroque in 1927 and the removal of the crown from the eagle's head during the Communist rule from 1944 to 1990. Legal specification for the shades of the national colors has also changed with time. The shade of red was first legally specified as <b>vermilion</b> by a presidential decree of 13 December 1928.|$|E
5|$|The {{greens are}} mostly verdigris, {{although}} those predominant {{in the landscape}} are mostly blends of blue and yellow pigments, and the green of the cloth worn by Mary Salome is malachite mixed with yellow lake. The browns are blends of reds and blacks. John's red robe is composed from cinnabar and <b>vermilion</b> made from rubia and insect dyes. Some of the reds are mixed with earth colours not susceptible {{to the effects of}} light, and have thus survived close to their original appearance. The black pigments are generally bone blacks but in places from charcoal. The blacks are mixed with chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{increase}} in trade, and new items {{had a significant}} impact on First Nations material cultures, seeing the rise of such traditions as fabric appliqué (Button Blankets), metalwork (Northwest Coast engraved silver jewelry originated around this time as native craftsmen learned to make jewelry from coins), and contributed to a cultural fluorescence with the advent of improved (iron) tools that saw the creative of more and larger carvings (a.k.a. 'totem poles'). New pigments available included <b>vermilion,</b> from China, that rapidly replaced earlier red pigments and can be seen on many artifacts from this era.|$|E
5|$|The {{main bar}} {{was large and}} black with curves in many directions. The room had black and white zebra-patterned wallpaper, {{in the style of}} New York's El Morocco club, and an indoor {{waterfall}} surrounded by imitation exotic vegetation stood in the back. Beyond the main bar was a smaller bar and a small showroom, and after that the club's main showroom, the <b>Vermilion</b> Room, with its burgundy velvet wallpaper. The small front room was used for year-round lounge acts and the main showroom with supper service featured top-billed acts in the summer months and for special bookings.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} fourth batches of {{streamlined}} locomotives, Nos. 6225–6229 and 6235–6244, were painted in crimson lake, with banding in gold lined with <b>vermilion</b> and black. Nameplates had a black background. LMS shop grey was carried briefly in service on No. 6229 Duchess of Hamilton from 7 September 1938 until its return to Crewe Works later that year. It was then painted crimson lake and disguised as No. 6220, {{in preparation for the}} 1939 visit to the New York World's Fair. Lettering and numerals for both Caledonian blue and crimson lake liveries were in a newly created style of unshaded sans-serif.|$|E
5|$|Tracking {{through the}} state as a {{weakening}} tropical storm, Humberto produced light to moderate winds across southwestern Louisiana. Gusts officially peaked at 43mph (69km/h) in the state, although an unofficial reading of 55mph (89km/h) was reported in Vinton. Heavy rainfall occurred across the area, reaching a peak of 8.25inches (210mm) in DeRidder. The rainfall triggered minor river flooding along the <b>Vermilion</b> River in Lafayette. Storm surge was minor in the state, peaking at 2.13feet (0.65m) in Cypremont Point; no beach erosion was reported.|$|E
5|$|Widespread {{freshwater}} flooding {{occurred in}} Beauregard Parish, leaving homes in DeRidder flooded. High water across the southwestern {{portion of the}} state resulted in the closure of several roadways, including U.S. Route 171 and various state highways. Isolated wind damage was reported, particularly near the Texas border, with some trees and power lines blown down. A total of about 13,000power customers lost electricity in southwestern Louisiana. One F1 tornado briefly touched down in <b>Vermilion</b> Parish, blowing the roof off one home and downing trees and power lines. Damage throughout Louisiana was estimated at $525,000.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the {{fly agaric}} has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native <b>vermilion</b> grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and bears no ring.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, <b>vermilion</b> of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E
5|$|Elcor sat atop {{a bed of}} {{taconite}} {{consisting of}} a uniform mixture of about 30% iron, interspersed with pockets of high-grade ore, {{a part of the}} Biwabik iron formation. The Biwabik iron formation is a large sheet of iron-bearing sediment deposited during the Precambrian era {{on the bottom of the}} Animikie Sea. This iron-bearing rock extends under Lake Superior from the Mesabi and <b>Vermilion</b> Iron Ranges, to the Gogebic Iron Range from northern Wisconsin into the Marquette Range of the upper peninsula of Michigan, and west to the manganese-rich ore of the Cuyuna Iron Range. Michigan's steel-blue high grade ores were quite different from the Mesabi ore, which was soft brown hematite. There is iron in other areas of Minnesota, but no longer in quantities that are practical to mine.|$|E
