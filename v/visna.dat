5000|$|Though it {{does not}} produce severe immunodeficiency, <b>visna</b> shares many {{characteristics}} with human immunodeficiency virus, including the establishment of persistent infection with chronic active lymphoproliferation; however, <b>visna</b> virus does not infect T-lymphocytes. The relationship of <b>visna</b> and HIV as lentiviruses {{was first published in}} 1985 by <b>visna</b> researcher Janice E. Clements and colleagues in the HIV field. It has been postulated that the effects of maedi-visna infection in sheep are the [...] "equivalent" [...] of central nervous system disease and wasting syndrome found in human AIDS patients. Despite limited sequence homology with HIV, the genomic organization of <b>visna</b> is very similar, allowing <b>visna</b> infection to be used as an in vivo and in vitro model system for HIV infection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Visna</b> {{virus has}} a positive-strand RNA genome {{approximately}} 9.2 kilobases in length. As a retrovirus in the genus lentivirinae, the genome is reverse transcribed into proviral DNA. The <b>visna</b> virus genome {{resembles that of}} other lentiviruses, {{in terms of the}} gene functions that are present. <b>Visna</b> virus is closely related to the caprine arthritis encephalitis virus but has limited nucleotide sequence similarity with other lentiviruses.|$|E
50|$|Research using <b>visna</b> was {{important}} in the identification and characterization of HIV. Nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrated that the AIDS virus was a retrovirus related to <b>visna</b> and provided early clues as to the mechanism of HIV infection.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Visna</b> virus (also {{known as}} visna-maedi virus, {{maedi-visna}} virus and ovine lentivirus) from the genus Lentivirus and subfamily Orthoretrovirinae, is a [...] "prototype" [...] retrovirus that causes encephalitis and chronic pneumonitis in sheep. It {{is known as}} <b>visna</b> when found in the brain, and maedi when infecting the lungs. Lifelong, persistent infections in sheep occur in the lungs, lymph nodes, spleen, joints, central nervous system, and mammary glands; The condition is sometimes known as [...] "ovine progressive pneumonia" [...] (OPP), particularly in the United States, or [...] "Montana sheep disease". White blood cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage are the main target of <b>visna</b> virus.|$|E
50|$|The {{slow virus}} concept was first {{introduced}} by Björn Sigurðsson {{and he and his}} co-workers made pioneering studies on slow diseases in sheep including mæði, <b>visna</b> and scrapie. Mæði is a slowly progressive interstitial pneumonia of adult sheep while <b>visna</b> is a slow, progressive encephalomyelitis and the same virus, belonging, to the lentivirus subgroup of retroviruses, was found to be responsible for both conditions.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>visna</b> {{viral genome}} encodes three {{structural}} genes characteristic of retroviruses, gag (group specific antigen), pol (polymerase), and env (envelope protein). [...] The genome also encodes two regulatory proteins, tat (trans-activator of transcription) and rev (regulator of virion protein expression). A rev response element (RRE) exists inside the env gene. An auxiliary gene, vif (viral infectivity factor), is also encoded. However, {{the number and}} role of auxiliary genes varies by strain of <b>visna</b> virus. The genome sequence is flanked by 5’ and 3’ long terminal repeats (LTRs).|$|E
50|$|One of Segal's claims {{was that}} Prof. Robert Gallo crossed the <b>Visna</b> sheep virus with the Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV I) in 1978 in the P4 {{laboratory}} of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in Fort Detrick. Proponents of this theory claim that 90% of HIV RNA {{is found in}} <b>Visna</b> and 10% in HTLV I. Genomic analysis, however, shows that such claims are false. Research after Segal's theory shows that HIV is much {{more closely related to}} the simian immunodeficiency virus than to any other virus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Visna</b> {{joined the}} Miss World Sri Lanka pageant in 2014. The pageant was won by Chulakshi Ranathunga who {{represented}} Sri Lanka in Miss World 2014 in London but declared unplaced.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pol gene}} encodes five enzymatic functions: a reverse {{transcriptase}}, RNase H, dUTPase, integrase, and protease. [...] The reverse transcriptase is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that exists as a heterodimer protein with RNase H activity. The dUTPase enzyme {{is not present}} in all lentiviruses. The role of the dUTPase in the <b>visna</b> virus life cycle is unclear. dUTPase-deficient <b>visna</b> virus knockout strains show no decrease in pathogenicity in vivo. [...] The integrase enzyme exists inside the viral capsid, facilitating integration into the host chromosome after entry and virion uncoating. The protease cleaves the gag and pol polyprotein precursor.|$|E

5000|$|The viral {{tat gene}} encodes a 94-amino acid protein. Tat {{is the most}} enigmatic of the {{proteins}} of the <b>visna</b> virus. Most {{studies have indicated that}} Tat is a transcription factor necessary for viral transcription from the LTRs. Tat contains both a suppressor domain and a powerful acidic activator domain on the N-terminus. It has been suggested that Tat interacts with the cellular AP-1 transcription factors Fos and Jun to bind to the TATA-binding protein and activate transcription. [...] However, other studies have suggested that the <b>visna</b> virus [...] "Tat" [...] protein is not a trans-activator for transcription but instead exhibits a function involved in cell cycle arrest, making it more closely related to the HIV-1 Vpr protein than Tat.|$|E
50|$|Examples of shieldmaidens {{mentioned}} by {{name in the}} Norse sagas include Brynhildr in the Vǫlsunga saga, Hervor in Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks, the Brynhildr of the Bósa saga ok Herrauðs, the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar and Princess Hed, <b>Visna</b> and Veborg in Gesta Danorum.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{said that}} the {{different}} sides drew mercenaries from Russia, England, Germany and Ireland, and {{on the side of}} the separatists of king Harald participated three hundred female soldiers, so-called Shieldmaidens, and the most famous one, besides <b>Visna</b> and Harald's own daughter Princess Hed, was Veborg; these three women are described as the generals of the female troops.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Visna</b> virus {{particles}} are spheres approximately 100 nm in diameter. Virions consist of an icosahedral capsid {{surrounded by an}} envelope derived from the host plasma membrane. [...] Inside the capsid are the nucleoprotein-genome complex and the reverse transcriptase and integrase enzymes. A crystal structure of the virion has not been obtained and the triangulation number of the icosahedron is unknown.|$|E
50|$|The term {{viral tropism}} {{refers to the}} cell types a virus infects. <b>Visna</b> virus is {{generally}} known to target cells of the immune system, mainly monocytes and their mature form, macrophages. Studies suggest {{that the amount of}} viral replication appears to have a direct correlation with the maturity of the infected cells, with relatively little virus replication in monocytes when compared to more mature macrophages.|$|E
50|$|<b>Visna</b> {{infection}} may {{progress to}} total paralysis leading to death via inanition; however, if given assistance in eating and drinking, infected animals may survive {{for long periods}} of time, sometimes greater than ten years. Viral replication is almost exclusively associated with macrophages in infected tissues; however, replication is restricted in these cells - that is, the majority of cells containing viral RNA do not produce infectious virus.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Visna</b> - Maedi is {{a chronic}} viral disease {{prevalent}} in adult sheep. The disease is rarely found in certain species of goat. Maedi <b>Visna</b> virus is {{also referred to}} as ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP). This disease corresponds to two clinical entities caused by the same Maedi is a form that results in a chronic progressive pneumonia. <b>Visna</b> refers to the neurological form of the disease and predominantly causes meningoencephalitis in adult sheep. This disease has inflicted many economic losses worldwide due to the long incubation period and the high mortality rate of sheep and goats. MV virus can infect sheep of any age but clinical symptoms rarely occur in sheep less than two years old. The onset of the diseases is gradual resulting in relentless loss of weight in addition to breathing problems. Cough, abortion, rapid breathing, depression, chronic mastitis and arthritis are also additional symptoms observed. These symptoms appear mostly in animals over the age of three and therefore might spread to other flocks before clinical diagnosis can be achieved. Animals showing the above symptoms might die within six months of infection. This causal lentivirus can be found in monocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages of infected sheep in the presence of humoral and cell mediated immune response and can also be detected by conducting several serological tests. Transmission of the disease occurs most commonly via the oral route caused by ingestion of colostrum or milk that contains the virus or inhalation of infected aerosol droplets. Due to variation of the strains of MVV, some of the association clinical symptoms may be more pre-dominant in a flock relative to others along with differences in genetic susceptibility patterns.|$|E
50|$|Clements has {{conducted}} and led research into numerous viruses, {{concentrating on the}} animal lentiviruses. Lentiviruses are a complex type of retroviruses, and include the human immunodeficiency viruses HIV-1 and HIV-2. Clements {{was the first to}} characterize the complex genome of the lentiviruses, describing the genomic structure of <b>visna</b> virus, a lentivirus of sheep. She performed similar work with caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV), a closely related virus of goats.|$|E
5000|$|The viral LTRs are {{essential}} for viral transcription. [...] The LTRs include a TATA box at the -20 position and a recognition site for the AP-4 transcription factor at the -60 position. [...] There are several AP-1 transcription factor binding sites in the viral LTRs. The closest AP-1 binding site is bound by the Jun and Fos proteins to activate transcription. [...] A duplicated motif in the <b>visna</b> virus LTR is associated with cell tropism and neurovirulence.|$|E
50|$|<b>Visna</b> {{once again}} competed in a {{national}} pageant this time through Miss Earth Sri Lanka. The pageant concentrates on the environmental awareness. The pageant was held at Citrus Waskaduwa Hotel in Colombo on 3 June 2015. She was declared as the winner. Sathma Nugera was proclaimed as first runner up while Harshani Ruman as second runner up. Miss Earth Sri Lanka 2014, Imaya Liyanage and Miss Earth 2014 Jamie Herrell of the Philippines crowned Fernando {{at the end of}} the event.|$|E
50|$|Antigenic {{shift is}} {{the process by which}} two or more {{different}} strains of a virus, or strains of two or more different viruses, combine to form a new subtype having a mixture of the surface antigens of the two or more original strains. The term is often applied specifically to influenza, as that is the best-known example, but the process is also known to occur with other viruses, such as <b>visna</b> virus in sheep. Antigenic shift is a specific case of reassortment or viral shift that confers a phenotypic change.|$|E
50|$|This {{reasoning}} ignores {{numerous examples}} of viruses other than HIV {{that can be}} pathogenic after evidence of immunity appears. Measles virus may persist for years in brain cells, eventually causing a chronic neurologic disease {{despite the presence of}} antibodies. Viruses such as Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex virus, and Varicella zoster may be activated after years of latency even in the presence of abundant antibodies. In other animals, viral relatives of HIV with long and variable latency periods, such as <b>visna</b> virus in sheep, cause central nervous system damage even after the production of antibodies.|$|E
50|$|With the {{discovery}} of AIDS and its cause, HIV, Clements' work took on a new dimension of relevance. In 1985, she published an article with HIV co-discoverer Robert Gallo and others describing the relationship of HIV to <b>visna</b> virus. This article helped to establish HIV as a lentivirus, not a leukemia virus as was originally thought. At the time, the origin of HIV was unknown, and Clements' work presented the possibility that HIV could have been transferred to humans from animals. Later, {{it was found that}} simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains from chimpanzee and monkey hosts were the likely progenitors of HIV.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to her work with <b>visna</b> and CAEV, Clements has conducted extensive research into SIV and HIV. Clements and her laboratory have published over 160 scientific articles. Alongside collaborators Chris Zink and Joseph L. Mankowski, Clements has investigated the innate immune response to retrovirus infection in an animal model of HIV encephalitis. Her recent work includes the use of minocycline, a common antibiotic often used against acne, to protect against viral encephalitis and slow viral replication. With Zink, Mankowski and HIV researchers Joel Blankson and Bob Siliciano, Clements has also developed a model of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} to study viral reservoirs: where HIV conceals itself in the body.|$|E
5000|$|Veborg's {{contribution}} {{in the battle}} is described in detail; One of the strongest warriors of King Harald was Ubbe from Friesland, who defeated three Swedish princes and the fighter Agnar before he was finally killed {{by one of the}} greatest fighters of the unionists, the warrior Starke. Veborg then rushed forward to kill Starke; She cut off his jaw, but he managed to escape her and cut off the arm of the Shieldmaiden <b>Visna,</b> who was holding the separatists banner. Veborg, described as very brave, then meets the warrior Thorkell the Stubborn in a long and furious struggle, until Thorkell [...] "after many wounds and much verbal arguing" [...] finally manage to kill her.|$|E
50|$|<b>Visna</b> Maedi {{virus is}} a {{retrovirus}} meaning its genome {{consists of a}} (+)RNA that undergoes reverse transcription and then is integrated into the host's genome after infection. This integration is what leads to VMV's lifelong persistent infection. VMV has a long incubation period. During the initial outbreak among sheep in Iceland, {{there was no sign}} of clinical disease until six years after the importation of the Karakul sheep, which brought the virus from Germany to Iceland. Susceptibility to infection also increases with a higher level. VMV infects cells of the monocyte lineage, but only replicates at high levels when the monocytes are more mature/differentiated. of maturity/differentiation of the monocytes. Infected differentiated monocytes, also known as macrophages, will continuously present VMV antigens inducing T-lymphocytes to produce cytokines that in turn induce the differentiation of monocytes.|$|E
50|$|According to Saxo Grammaticus, both hosts {{prepared}} for seven years, and mustered armies of 200 000 men. Harald {{was joined by}} the legendary heroes Ubbe of Friesland, Uvle Brede, Are the One-eyed, Dag the Fat, Duk the Slav, Hroi Whitebeard and Hothbrodd the Indomitable as well as 300 shieldmaidens led by Hed, <b>Visna</b> of the Slavs and Hedborg. Sigurd recruited the legendary heroes Starkad, Egil the Bald, Grette the Evil (a Norwegian), Blig Bignose, Einar the Fatbellied and Erling Snake. Famous Swedes were Arwakki, Keklu-Karl, Krok the peasant, Gummi and Gudfast from Gislamark. They were joined by scores of Norwegians, Slavs, Finns, Estonians, Curonians, Bjarmians, Livonians, Saxons, Angles, Frisians, Irish, Rus' etc... All picking their sides. Whole forests were chopped down {{in order to build}} 3000 longships to transport the Swedes. Harald's Danes had built so many ships that they could walk across The Sound.|$|E
50|$|<b>Visna</b> Maedi virus (VMV) {{belongs to}} the small {{ruminant}} lentivirus group (SRLV). In general, SRLVs enter the cell through the interaction of their glycosylated envelope protein with a cellular receptor on the cell's plasma membrane facilitating fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. However, the specific cellular receptor that VMV binds is not entirely certain. A few studies have proposed MHC class II, CD4 and CXCR4 proteins as possible receptors however, none of these proteins have been established as the main receptor. Another study suggests that C-type lectins part of the mannose receptor (MR) family play a role as an alternative SRLV receptor. The mannose receptor is a 180-kDa transmembrane protein with eight tandem C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) of which CRD4 and CRD5 are essential in recognizing mannose, fucose and N-acetyl glucosamine residues. Studies suggest that VMV gains entrance to the cell via mannosylated residues on its envelope proteins. MR is involved in recognizing the surface of pathogens and is involved in phago- and endocytosis and mediating antigen processing and presentation {{in a variety of}} cells including monocyte/macrophages and endothelial cells.|$|E
5000|$|Herrell's {{international}} trip started officially {{when she}} traveled to Sri Lanka after her Miss Philippines Earth 2015 duties. She was welcomed {{at the airport}} and was later billeted to the Hilton Hotel in Colombo. Herrell later conducted interviews and pictorials for Derana TV and for various magazines and newspapers including Hi Magazine, Sunday Lankadeepa and Sunday Times. She also participated in a tree planting activity and a toured Colombo. Prior to crowning the next Miss Earth Sri Lanka, Herrell visited jewelry and crown creator Aminra and had a photo shoot on the Sri Lankan beach and was welcomed with a traditional lamp lighting ceremony at Citrus Hotel. Herrell graced the Miss Earth Sri Lanka 2015 pageant {{and at the end of}} the event, Herrell together with Miss Earth Sri Lanka 2014 Imaya Liyanage, crowned <b>Visna</b> Fernando as the winner of Miss Earth Sri Lanka 2015. She also led a lake clean-up activity with Derana TV, the Miss Earth Sri Lanka beauties and volunteers. Thereafter, she visited the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau where she planted the one millionth tree of the bureau's [...] "1 Million Tree Project". She later visited a temple where she received blessings from a high priest.|$|E
5000|$|Jakob Segal (1911-1995), a {{professor}} at Humboldt University in then-East Germany, proposed that HIV was engineered at a U.S. military laboratory at Fort Detrick, by splicing together two other viruses, <b>Visna</b> and HTLV-1. According to his theory, the new virus, created between 1977 and 1978, was tested on prison inmates who had volunteered for the experiment in exchange for early release. He further suggested that it was through these prisoners that the virus was spread to the population at large. At {{the end of the}} Cold War, former KGB agents Vasili Mitrokhin and Oleg Gordievsky independently revealed that the Fort Detrick hypothesis was a propaganda operation devised by the KGB's First Chief Directorate codenamed [...] "Operation INFEKTION". This revelation was later supported by officer Günther Bohnensack of section X of East Germany's Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung. It is known that Segal was in close contact with Russian KGB officers and Mitrokhin mentioned him as a central asset of the operation. It is not entirely clear whether Segal pursued the hypothesis independently on his own accord or whether he was simply following orders. Segal himself always denied the latter and kept pursuing the hypothesis even after the operation had been canceled and the Cold War had ended.|$|E
5000|$|The {{campaign}} {{started in}} earnest in October 1985 {{after the story}} was ignored for two years, with the original article being republished by Soviet newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta. To lend credence, the Soviet Union used a pseudo-scientific paper written in 1986 by a retired Russian-born East German biophysicist named Dr. Jakob Segal, co-authored by his wife, Dr. Lilli Segal; and Dr. Ronald Dehmlow at Humboldt University of East Berlin. The report was quoted heavily by Soviet propagandists, and the Segals (who were educated in France) were often said to be French researchers in order to hide their connections with communism. Dr. Segal postulated that the AIDS virus was synthesized by combining parts of two distantly related retroviruses: <b>VISNA</b> and HTLV-1. An excerpt of the Segal report is as follows: [...] It is very easy using genetic technologies to unite two parts of completely independent viruses… but who {{would be interested in}} doing this? The military, of course… In 1977 a special top security lab… was set up…at the Pentagon’s central biological laboratory. One year after that… the first cases of AIDS occurred in the US, in New York City. How it occurred precisely at this moment and how the virus managed {{to get out of the}} secret, hush-hush laboratory is quite easy to understand. Everyone knows that prisoners are used for military experiments in the U.S. They are promised their freedom if they come out of the experiment alive. [...] Elsewhere in the report, Segal said that his hypothesis was based purely on assumptions, extrapolations, and hearsay and not at all on direct scientific evidence.|$|E
