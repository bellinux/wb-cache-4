40|$|Abstract—Relatively {{little is}} known about the cause of death in the veteran population, {{although}} more is known about the cause of death in Vietnam veterans or veterans receiving mental health services. This article compares characteristics and causes of death in Washington State <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> did and did not use Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare services in the 5 years prior to death. This study included 62, 080 <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> died between 1998 and 2002, of whom 21 % were users of VA healthcare services. The <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> used VA healthcare ser-vices were younger, more often men, less educated, more often divorced, and more often smokers than the <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> did not use VA healthcare services. Both female and male <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> used VA healthcare services were more likely to die from drug-and/or alcohol-related causes. These findings suggest that the VA patient population is socially disadvantaged and more severely affected by substance-use disorders compared with <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> do not use VA healthcare services...|$|R

40|$|Gulf War {{veterans}} {{have reported}} health {{problems that they}} attribute to their military service, but little is understood about the nature or extent of these conditions. To determine whether Kansas Gulf War veterans are affected by excess health problems, a population-based survey of 1, 548 <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> served in the Persian Gulf War (PGW) and 482 <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> served elsewhere (non-PGW) was conducted in 1998. Gulf War illness, defined as having chronic symptoms in three of six domains, occurred in 34 % of PGW veterans, 12 % of non-PGW <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> reported receiving vaccines during the war, and 4 % of non-PGW <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> did not receive vaccines. The prevalence of Gulf War illness was lowest among PGW <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> served on board ship (21 %) and highest among those who were in Iraq and/or Kuwait (42 %). Among PGW <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> served away from battlefield areas, Gulf War illness was least prevalent among those who departed the region prior to the war (9 %) and most prevalent among those who departed in June or July of 1991 (41 %). Observed patterns suggest that excess morbidity among Gulf War veterans is associated with characteristics of their wartime service, and that vaccines used during the war may be a contributing factor.

Recruited from Victoria– although at various times the battalion's composition was boosted by recruits from other states– the 17th also consisted of the 2/5th, 2/7th and 2/8th Battalions.|$|E

Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Verrier– a World War I <b>veteran</b> <b>who</b> had served in the 10th and 50th Battalions– after the battalion's recruits had concentrated at Wayville, the 2/10th carried out initial training in the Adelaide Hills to the city's east at Woodside Camp, before moving to New South Wales on the east coast of Australia where further training was completed at Greta Camp and then Ingleburn. In early May 1940, the battalion was ready to deploy overseas, and embarked on the transport ship Mauretania, which departed Sydney on 5 May 1940, bound for the Middle East.|$|E
