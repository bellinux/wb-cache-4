5|$|Andesite at Slag Hill {{consists}} of 70% dark brown volcanic glass with varied degrees of trachytic texture in the plagioclastic matrix {{and less than}} 5% of the andesite comprises <b>vesicular</b> textures. Plagioclase, hornblende and augite are mostly in form as phenocrysts and comprise 1% to 10% of the andesite. Orthoclase crystals are found occasionally and they likely represent xenocrysts.|$|E
5|$|At Ring Mountain, {{andesite}} comprises 70% brown {{volcanic glass}} and <b>vesicular</b> textures {{as much as}} 15%. The plagioclastic matrix is trachytic. Augite, biotite, plagioclase and hornblende occur as microphenocrysts and comprise 1% to 7% of the andesite. Small qualities of quartz are common and occur as microxenocrysts. Microxenocrysts of orthoclase likely exist in andesite at Ring Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Little Ring Mountain at the {{northern}} end of the field contains at least 70% brown volcanic glass with isolated phenocrysts of plagioclase. <b>Vesicular</b> textures are up to 5%, suggesting that the lava erupted subaerially. Probable xenocrysts of quartz have been identified at the volcano. At least one xenolith fragment has been found in loose rubble at the volcano and included several quartz xenocrysts and polycrystalline quartz xenoliths in a glassy matrix with trachytic plagioclase.|$|E
5|$|Rocks sampled in the {{immediate}} vicinity of the Lunar Module are mostly <b>vesicular</b> coarse-grained subfloor basalt, with some appearance of fine-grained basalt as well. Much of the valley floor, as displayed in observations of {{the immediate}} landing area, is predominately regolith and fragments varying in sizes excavated by several impacts in the Moon's history.|$|E
5|$|Several rock types {{with varying}} {{chemical}} compositions make up Level Mountain. Ankaramites and alkali basalts {{are the primary}} volcanic rocks comprising the basal shield. Alkali basalts form columnar jointed lava flows, <b>vesicular</b> lava flows, dikes and scoria while ankaramites are present as dark-coloured lava flows with several columnar cooling units. Trachybasalts, phonolites, trachytes, peralkaline trachytes, pantellerites, comendites and rhyolites form the overlying stratovolcano and domes. They comprise dikes, welded tuffs, pitchstones, volcanic plugs, laccoliths and flows. Trachybasalts are {{in the form of}} two textural types; phenocryst-rich lava flows and fragmental flow agglomerates. Phonolites are <b>vesicular</b> and pumiceous in nature, although phonolites with trachytic texture are also present. Trachytes and peralkaline trachytes are the primary volcanic rocks in the Level Mountain Range. Comendite lava flows appear to have erupted fluidly, forming lava tubes. Rhyolites are in the form of stubby lava flows and domes.|$|E
5|$|Some {{features}} of the accessory glands in the male genital region vary among oryzomyines. In Transandinomys talamancae, {{a single pair of}} preputial glands is present at the penis. As is usual for sigmodontines, there are two pairs of ventral prostate glands and a single pair of anterior and dorsal prostate glands. Part {{of the end of the}} <b>vesicular</b> gland is irregularly folded, not smooth as in most oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of ash from eruptions of high-viscosity magmas (e.g., rhyolite, dacite, {{and some}} andesites) is mostly {{dependent on the}} shape of vesicles in the rising magma before disintegration. Vesicles are formed by the expansion of magmatic gas before the magma has solidified. Ash particles can have varying degrees of vesicularity and <b>vesicular</b> particles can have extremely high surface area to volume ratios. Concavities, troughs, and tubes observed on grain surfaces {{are the result of}} broken vesicle walls. Vitric ash particles from high-viscosity magma eruptions are typically angular, <b>vesicular</b> pumiceous fragments or thin vesicle-wall fragments while lithic fragments in volcanic ash are typically equant, or angular to subrounded. Lithic morphology in ash is generally controlled by the mechanical properties of the wall rock broken up by spalling or explosive expansion of gases in the magma as it reaches the surface.|$|E
5|$|Exocytosis in prokaryotes: Membrane <b>vesicular</b> exocytosis, {{popularly known}} as {{membrane}} vesicle trafficking, a Nobel prize-winning (year, 2013) process, is traditionally regarded as a prerogative of eukaryotic cells. This myth was however broken with the revelation that nanovesicles, {{popularly known as}} bacterial outer membrane vesicles, released by gram-negative microbes, translocate bacterial signal molecules to host or target cells to carry out multiple processes in favour of the secreting microbe e.g., in host cell invasion and microbe-environment interactions, in general.|$|E
5|$|Such {{trafficking}} capacity {{depends on}} the MAM, which {{has been shown to}} facilitate transfer of lipid intermediates between organelles. In contrast to the standard <b>vesicular</b> mechanism of lipid transfer, evidence indicates that the physical proximity of the ER and mitochondrial membranes at the MAM allows for lipid flipping between opposed bilayers. Despite this unusual and seemingly energetically unfavorable mechanism, such transport does not require ATP. Instead, in yeast, it {{has been shown to be}} dependent on a multiprotein tethering structure termed the ER-mitochondria encounter structure, or ERMES, although it remains unclear whether this structure directly mediates lipid transfer or is required to keep the membranes in sufficiently close proximity to lower the energy barrier for lipid flipping.|$|E
5|$|The dacite volcanics {{composing}} Mount Fee contain brown {{volcanic glass}} {{as much as}} 70% and <b>vesicular</b> textures as much as 15%. About 25% of the volcanics contain crystal content, including plagioclase, hornblende, orthopyroxene, orthoclase and sporadic quartz. The orthoclase crystals are interpreted to represent rock fragments that became enveloped during hardening of the dacitic lavas. A portion of the southwestern flank of Mount Fee comprises no volcanic glass, but rather composed of an abnormal cryptocrystalline matrix. This indicates {{that it might have}} developed as part of a subvolcanic intrusion.|$|E
5|$|In April 2004, Farmer {{announced}} {{the formation of}} a committee to study the effectiveness of state owned and operated farmer's markets. In June 2005, he was elected secretary of the Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture; in 2007, he was elected president of the organization. Farmer also sought to prevent an outbreak of <b>vesicular</b> stomatitis virus in the state's horses and cattle by banning the import of animals from 20 western counties where the virus was known to have infected animals. On Farmer's advice, Governor Ernie Fletcher requested that the United States Department of Agriculture designate Kentucky as an agricultural disaster area after an April 2007 cold snap devastated the state's fruit and wheat crops; the designation made Kentucky farmers eligible for low-interest federal loans to help compensate for their lost crop revenue.|$|E
5|$|In the early, or {{fulminating}} form, hemorrhaging {{appears on}} {{the second or third}} day as sub-conjunctival bleeding turns the whites of the eyes deep red. Hemorrhagic smallpox also produces a dusky erythema, petechiae, and hemorrhages in the spleen, kidney, serosa, muscle, and, rarely, the epicardium, liver, testes, ovaries and bladder. Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present. A later form of the disease occurs in patients who survive for 8–10 days. The hemorrhages appear in the early eruptive period, and the rash is flat and does not progress beyond the <b>vesicular</b> stage. Patients in the early stage of disease show a decrease in coagulation factors (e.g. platelets, prothrombin, and globulin) and an increase in circulating antithrombin. Patients in the late stage have significant thrombocytopenia; however, deficiency of coagulation factors is less severe. Some in the late stage also show increased antithrombin. This form of smallpox occurs in anywhere from 3 to 25 percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain. Hemorrhagic smallpox is usually fatal.|$|E
5|$|Inside the brain, {{dopamine}} {{functions as}} a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, and is controlled {{by a set of}} mechanisms common to all monoamine neurotransmitters. After synthesis, dopamine is transported from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles by a solute carrier—a <b>vesicular</b> monoamine transporter, VMAT2. Dopamine is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the synaptic cleft. In most cases, the release of dopamine occurs through a process called exocytosis which is caused by action potentials, {{but it can also be}} caused by the activity of an intracellular trace amine-associated receptor, TAAR1. TAAR1 is a high-affinity receptor for dopamine, trace amines, and certain substituted amphetamines that is located along membranes in the intracellular milieu of the presynaptic cell; activation of the receptor can regulate dopamine signaling by inducing dopamine reuptake inhibition and efflux as well as by inhibiting neuronal firing through a diverse set of mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} is further complicated when considering fusion in vivo since biological fusion {{is almost always}} regulated {{by the action of}} membrane-associated proteins. The first of these proteins to be studied were the viral fusion proteins, which allow an enveloped virus to insert its genetic material into the host cell (enveloped viruses are those surrounded by a lipid bilayer; some others have only a protein coat). Eukaryotic cells also use fusion proteins, the best-studied of which are the SNAREs. SNARE proteins are used to direct all <b>vesicular</b> intracellular trafficking. Despite years of study, much is still unknown about the function of this protein class. In fact, there is still an active debate regarding whether SNAREs are linked to early docking or participate later in the fusion process by facilitating hemifusion.|$|E
5|$|HTT is {{expressed}} in all mammalian cells. The highest concentrations {{are found in the}} brain and testes, with moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and lungs. The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, cell signaling, and intracellular transporting. In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found. In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an anti-apoptotic agent preventing programmed cell death and controls the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. HTT also facilitates <b>vesicular</b> transport and synaptic transmission and controls neuronal gene transcription. If the expression of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, brain cell survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT. In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease. It is thought that the disease is not caused by inadequate production of HTT, but by a gain of toxic function of mHTT.|$|E
25|$|In vitro {{studies have}} shown that sperm {{expelled}} together with seminal <b>vesicular</b> fluid show poor motility and survival, and the sperm chromatin is less protected. Therefore, the exact physiological importance of seminal <b>vesicular</b> fluid is not clear.|$|E
25|$|Once at the synapse, {{synaptic}} vesicles {{are loaded}} with a neurotransmitter. Loading of transmitter is an active process requiring a neurotransmitter transporter and a proton pump ATPase that provides an electrochemical gradient. These transporters are selective for different classes of transmitters. Characterization of unc-17 and unc-47, which encode the <b>vesicular</b> acetylcholine transporter and <b>vesicular</b> GABA transporter have been described to date.|$|E
25|$|Transport {{proteins}} {{are composed}} of proton pumps that generate electrochemical gradients, which allow for neurotransmitter uptake, and neurotransmitter transporters that regulate the actual uptake of neurotransmitters. The necessary proton gradient is created by V-ATPase, which breaks down ATP for energy. <b>Vesicular</b> transporters move neurotransmitters from the cells' cytoplasm into the synaptic vesicles. <b>Vesicular</b> glutamate transporters, for example, sequester glutamate into vesicles by this process.|$|E
25|$|MDMA acts {{primarily}} as a presynaptic releasing agent of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, which arises from its activity at trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and <b>vesicular</b> monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). MDMA is a monoamine transporter substrate (i.e., a substrate for DAT, NET, and SERT), so it enters monoamine neurons via these neuronal membrane transport proteins; by acting as a monoamine transporter substrate, MDMA produces competitive reuptake inhibition at the neuronal membrane transporters (i.e., it competes with endogenous monoamines for reuptake). MDMA inhibits both <b>vesicular</b> monoamine transporters (VMATs), the second of which (VMAT2) is highly expressed within monoamine neurons at <b>vesicular</b> membranes. Once inside a monoamine neuron, MDMA acts as a VMAT2 inhibitor and a TAAR1 agonist.|$|E
25|$|Thymic {{cortical}} {{epithelial cells}} have abundant cytoplasm, <b>vesicular</b> nucleus with finely divided chromatin and small nucleoli and cytoplasmic filaments contact adjacent cells.|$|E
25|$|Reserpine almost irreversibly {{blocks the}} uptake (and storage) of {{norepinephrine}} (i.e. noradrenaline) and dopamine into synaptic vesicles by inhibiting the <b>vesicular</b> monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2).|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} half of Hainan {{is covered}} with the ancient Hainan Volcanic Field. Beneath the topsoil is volcanic rock while the topsoil itself contains small pieces of this <b>vesicular</b> rock.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} genitalia {{comprise the}} accessory sex glands, {{which include the}} <b>vesicular</b> glands, the prostate gland and the bulbourethral glands. These contribute fluid to the semen at ejaculation, but are not strictly necessary for fertility.|$|E
25|$|A complicating {{factor is}} the endemic spread of swine <b>vesicular</b> disease (SVD) in Taiwan. The {{symptoms}} are indistinguishable from FMD, which {{may have led to}} previous misdiagnosing of FMD as SVD. Laboratory analysis was seldom used for diagnosis, and FMD may thus have gone unnoticed for some time.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of assay types that allow the {{detection}} of ABC transporter interactions with endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. The complexity of assay range from relatively simple membrane assays. like <b>vesicular</b> transport assay, ATPase assay to more complex cell based assays up to intricate in vivo detection methodologies.|$|E
25|$|The ideal {{lava flow}} {{will have a}} {{brecciated}} top, either as pillow lava development, autobreccia and rubble typical of aā and viscous flows, or a <b>vesicular</b> or frothy carapace such as scoria or pumice. The top of the lava will tend to be glassy, having been flash frozen {{in contact with the}} air or water.|$|E
25|$|Researchers at the USAMRIID facility, where {{military}} biologists study infectious diseases, have {{a promising}} vaccine candidate. They {{have developed a}} replication-competent vaccine against Lassa virus based on recombinant <b>vesicular</b> stomatitis virus vectors expressing the Lassa virus glycoprotein. After a single intramuscular injection, test primates have survived lethal challenge, while showing no clinical symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Ring Mountain, {{just north}} of Slag Hill, is a {{parasitic}} tuya composed of plagioclase-hypersthene-phyric andesite. The highest elevation of the volcano comprises bomb-like fragments of <b>vesicular,</b> oxidized lava, suggesting that the higher elevation lava flows were most likely subaerial. However, {{as is the case}} at volcanoes of comparable morphology elsewhere, lower elevations might have erupted subglacially.|$|E
25|$|Neurotransmitter {{release is}} {{dependent}} on an external supply of Ca2+ ions which enter axon terminals via voltage-gated calcium channels. <b>Vesicular</b> fusion with the terminal membrane and release of the neurotransmitter {{is caused by the}} generation of Ca2+ gradients induced by incoming action potentials. The Ca2+ ions cause the mobilization of newly synthesized vesicles from a reserve pool to undergo this membrane fusion. This mechanism of action was discovered in squid giant axons. Lowering intracellular Ca2+ ions provides a direct inhibitory effect on neurotransmitter release. After release of the neurotransmitter occurs, <b>vesicular</b> membranes are recycled to their origins of production. Calcium ion channels can vary depending on the location of incidence. For example, the channels at an axon terminal differ from the typical calcium channels of a cell body (whether neural or not). Even at axon terminals, calcium ion channel types can vary, {{as is the case with}} P-type calcium channels located at the neuromuscular junction.|$|E
25|$|The {{lava flows}} formed the {{conditions}} for creation of Lake Superior agates. As the lava solidified, water vapor and carbon dioxide trapped within the solidified flows formed a <b>vesicular</b> texture (literally millions of small bubbles). Later, groundwater transported ferric iron, silica, and other dissolved minerals passed through the trapped gas vesicles. These quartz-rich groundwater solutions deposited concentric bands of fine-grained quartz called chalcedony, or embedded agates.|$|E
25|$|Because watery nasal {{discharge}} containing live virus usually precedes both exanthem (external rash) and enanthem (oral ulcers) by 1 to 2 days, {{the infected}} person actually becomes contagious {{one to two}} days before recognition of the disease. Contagiousness persists until all <b>vesicular</b> lesions have become dry crusts (scabs), which usually entails four or five days, by which time nasal shedding of live virus ceases.|$|E
25|$|Reserpine irreversibly {{blocks the}} <b>vesicular</b> monoamine {{transporter}} (VMAT). This normally transports free intracellular norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine in the presynaptic nerve terminal into presynaptic vesicles for subsequent release into the synaptic cleft ("exocytosis"). Unprotected neurotransmitters are metabolized by MAO (as {{well as by}} COMT) in the cytoplasm and consequently never excite the post-synaptic cell. Thus, reserpine decreases metabolic rate of monoamine neurotransmitters; but also decreases magnitude of monoamine release.|$|E
25|$|Though {{there are}} {{multiple}} models that attempt to explain <b>vesicular</b> traffic throughout the Golgi, no individual model can independently explain all observations of the Golgi apparatus. Currently, the cisternal progression/maturation model is the most accepted among scientists, accommodating many observations across eukaryotes. The other models are still important in framing questions and guiding future experimentation. Among the fundamental unanswered questions are the directionality of COPI vesicles and role of Rab GTPases in modulating protein cargo traffic.|$|E
25|$|Immunohistochemical studies (detecting antigens by {{exploiting}} {{the principle of}} antibodies binding specifically to antigens in biological tissues) showed that CR cells expressed GABA-A and GABA-B receptors, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, <b>vesicular</b> glutamate transporters, {{and a number of}} different calcium-binding proteins, such as calbindin, calretinin and parvalbumin. CR cells express several genes important in corticogenesis, such as reelin (RELN), LIS1, EMX2, and DS-CAM. CR cells selectively express p73, a member of the p53 family involved in cell death and survival.|$|E
25|$|Rhabdoviruses are {{a diverse}} family of single stranded, {{negative}} sense RNA viruses that infect {{a wide range}} of hosts, from plants and insects, to fish and mammals. The Rhaboviridae family consists of six genera, two of which, cytorhabdoviruses and nucleorhabdoviruses, only infect plants. Novirhabdoviruses infect fish, and vesiculovirus, lyssavirus and ephemerovirus infect mammals, fish and invertebrates. The family includes pathogens such as rabies virus, <b>vesicular</b> stomatitis virus and potato yellow dwarf virus that are of public health, veterinary, and agricultural significance.|$|E
25|$|Translocation: The {{receptor}} is, {{along with}} {{the part of the}} membrane it is embedded in, brought {{to the inside of the}} cell, where it is dephosphorylated within the acidic <b>vesicular</b> environment and then brought back. This mechanism is used to regulate long-term exposure, for example, to a hormone, by allowing resensitisation to follow desensitisation. Alternatively, the receptor may undergo lysozomal degradation, or remain internalised, where it is thought to participate in the initiation of signalling events, the nature of which depending on the internalised vesicle's subcellular localisation.|$|E
