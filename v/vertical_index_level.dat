The evaluation was performed using SENSE (SEmantic N-levels Search Engine), a semantic search engine that tries to overcome the limitations of the ranked keyword approach by introducing semantic levels, which integrate (and not simply replace) the lexical level represented by keywords. We show how SENSE is able to manage documents indexed at two separate levels, keyword and word meaning, in an attempt of improving the retrieval performance. Two types of experiments have been performed by exploiting both only one <b>indexing</b> <b>level</b> and all <b>indexing</b> <b>levels</b> at the same time. The experiments performed combining keywords and word meanings, extracted from the WordNet lexical database, show the promise of the idea and point out the value of our institution.

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective long term, longitudinal, radiographic follow-up {{study of the}} Bryan Cervical Disc Prosthesis (Medtronic, Memphis, TN, USA) was performed in patients treated for single-level degenerative disc disease. OBJECTIVES: This study assesses the change in motion at the <b>index</b> <b>level</b> and the change in motion and disc degeneration at the adjacent levels over time. BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies have shown that}} the prosthesis is able to remain mobile at intermediate follow-up. It is hypothesized that this mobility protects against an abnormal increase in adjacent level motion resulting in an accelerated degeneration of those levels, as seen after interbody fusion. However, data is lacking on how the mobility of the <b>index</b> <b>level</b> and adjacent levels and how degeneration of the adjacent levels evolves over time. METHODS: Patients were included in this follow-up study, if their preoperative range of motion (ROM) at the <b>index</b> <b>level</b> was > 2 °. Intervertebral disc degeneration was assessed using an objective and validated scoring system ranging from 0 (no degeneration) to 9 (severe degeneration). Based on lateral radiographs, ROM was calculated using a custom motion analysis tool (measurement error: 0. 3 °). RESULTS: In total, 71 patients were included. In March 2009, 67 patients had 4 years, 65 had 6 years, and 18 had 8 years radiographic follow-up. On average, preoperative ROM was 9. 7 +/- 5. 2 ° at <b>index</b> <b>level,</b> and 11. 7 +/- 4. 6 ° and 10. 0 +/- 5. 0 ° at the cranial and caudal adjacent levels. As seen in figure 1, at <b>index</b> <b>level</b> ROM stabilized slightly above the preoperative value at 4 year, 6 year and 8 year follow-up (p> 0. 05). At the adjacent levels, a similar trend was observed (p> 0. 05). On average, the preoperative degeneration score was 2. 4 +/- 2. 0 at the <b>index</b> <b>level,</b> 1. 1 +/- 1. 5 at the cranial and 0. 8 +/- 1. 4 at the caudal adjacent level. As seen in figure 2, the degeneration score at the adjacent levels increased not abnormally at 4 year, 6 year and 8 year follow-up. There was a significant correlation between preoperative and postoperative degeneration for both adjacent levels (r> 0. 76). CONCLUSIONS: ROM at the <b>index</b> <b>level</b> is maintained up to 8 years after surgery. Moreover, the insertion of the prosthesis did not lead to an abnormal increase in ROM of the adjacent levels. The Bryan Cervical Disc Prosthesis seems to protect against acceleration of adjacent level degeneration as seen after interbody fusion. status: publishe...|$|R

In this study, we measured serum anti-p 53 antibody levels in 52 patients with lung cancer and 63 normal volunteers to determine the relationship between anti-p 53 antibody level and clinical features of lung cancer patients. Anti-p 53 antibody level was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and expressed as an anti-p 53 antibody index, defined as the ratio of absorption of serum sample to that of p 53 -positive serum. The median anti-p 53 antibody index was 6. 6 for lung cancer patients, and higher than that in normal volunteers (1. 7) (P = 0. 0000). For lung cancer patients, significant differences in <b>index</b> <b>levels</b> were found by histology (4. 3, n = 25, adenocarcinoma vs 8. 7, n = 18, squamous cell carcinoma vs 64. 8, n = 2, large-cell carcinoma vs 9. 8, n = 7, small-cell carcinoma; P = 0. 0109). High anti-p 53 antibody <b>index</b> <b>levels</b> were observed for both large-cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma. When the cut-off level was set at 7. 2, determined using the twice 95 % specificity level for normal volunteers, the sensitivities of anti-p 53 antibodies were 46. 1 % for all lung cancers, 28. 0 % for adenocarcinoma, 55. 6 % for squamous cell carcinoma, 100 % for large-cell carcinoma and 71. 4 % for small-cell carcinoma. However, {{there were no significant differences}} in <b>index</b> <b>level</b> by gender, age, smoking index, presence of previous or concomitant cancer or disease stage.
