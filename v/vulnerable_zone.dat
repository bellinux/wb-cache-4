40|$|Spiral wave {{initiation}} in {{the heart}} muscle is a mechanism for the onset of dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. A standard protocol for spiral wave initiation is {{the application of a}} stimulus in the refractory tail of a propagating excitation wave, a region that we call the "classical <b>vulnerable</b> <b>zone.</b> " Previous studies of vulnerability to spiral wave initiation did not take the influence of deformation into account, which has been shown to have a substantial effect on the excitation process of cardiomyocytes via the mechano-electrical feedback phenomenon. In this work we study the effect of deformation on the vulnerability of excitable media in a discrete reaction-diffusion-mechanics (dRDM) model. The dRDM model combines FitzHugh-Nagumo type equations for cardiac excitation with a discrete mechanical description of a finite-elastic isotropic material (Seth material) to model cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and stretch activated depolarizing current. We show that deformation alters the "classical," and forms a new <b>vulnerable</b> <b>zone</b> at longer coupling intervals. This mechanically caused <b>vulnerable</b> <b>zone</b> results in a new mechanism of spiral wave initiation, where unidirectional conduction block and rotation directions of the consequently initiated spiral waves are opposite compared to the mechanism of spiral wave initiation due to the "classical <b>vulnerable</b> <b>zone.</b> " We show that this new mechanism of spiral wave initiation can naturally occur in situations that involve wave fronts with curvature, and discuss its relation to supernormal excitability of cardiac tissue. The concept of mechanically induced vulnerability may lead to a better understanding about the onset of dangerous heart arrhythmias via mechano-electrical feedback...|$|E

40|$|Groundwater {{pollution}} {{is one of}} the most serious environmental problems in the world. Human activities, e. g. industrial, agricultural and household represent a real threat for groundwater quality. In areas where Groundwater constitutes the main drinking water resources, its vulnerability assessment, to delineate areas that are more susceptible to contamination has become an important element for water resource management and land use planning. Hence, maps of groundwater vulnerability to pollution are becoming more in demand because this essential resource for life represents the main source of drinking water in many parts of the world and particularly in northern China where there is insufficient surface water. This study used the ArcGIS 9. 2 software and geographical information system (GIS) techniques to apply an EPA model for determining intrinsic vulnerability of groundwater to pollution in Linfen Basin, Shanxi Province, China.   The model is called DRASTIC, representing hydrogeological parameters such as Depth to Aquifer, Net Recharge, Aquifer Media, Soil Media, Topography, Impact of vadose Zones, and Hydraulic Conductivity. The DRASTIC model uses environmental parameters to characterize the hydrogeological setting of any area and to evaluate the aquifer vulnerability. The DRASTIC scores obtained from the model vary from 59 to 147, where the higher value implies the relative greater vulnerability. These values were reclassified into three classes: very low, low and moderate <b>vulnerable</b> <b>zones.</b> The moderate vulnerability zones of Linfen Basin are located in the north and southeastern part of the basin. The moderate <b>vulnerable</b> <b>zones</b> cover around 16. 38 % of the study area. Huozhou City in the north, Yicheng County, Qu Wo County in the south east are concerned by moderate vulnerability zones. The   very low <b>vulnerable</b> <b>zones</b> are well distributed and are mainly located in the middle and south parts of the basin. Some very low <b>vulnerable</b> <b>zones</b> can also be seen in the north east and extreme east parts. Very low <b>vulnerable</b> <b>zones</b> cover about 40. 13 % of the study area. The remaining parts of the Linfen basin are under low <b>vulnerable</b> <b>zones</b> (43. 49 %) which are located in the west and Middle West parts of the region. The results of this study can be used to determine where communities should undertake aggressive protection of the groundwater.   Regional development planners will benefit from knowledge of local sensitive aquifers. </p...|$|R

In China, the exploitation of aquifers has been historically undertaken without proper concern for environmental impacts or even the concept of sustainable yield. In order to maintain basin aquifer {{as a source of}} water for the area, it is necessary to find out whether certain locations in this groundwater basin are susceptible to receive and transmit pollution, this is why the main objective of this research is to find out the groundwater vulnerable zones using Geographical Information System (GIS) model in Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou plain. GIS was used to create groundwater vulnerability map by overlaying hydro-geological data. The input of the model was provided by the following seven data layers: Depth to water, net Recharge, Aquifer media, Soil media, Topography, Impact of vadose zone and hydraulic Conductivity.

In the middle catchment of this basin, there are 239 stone mines and 982 stone crushing units. These produce approximately 258120 tons of dust {{every year and}} this dust enters into the river and coats the leaves of plants. On the one hand, this is aggrading in the stream bed, increasing sediment load, decreasing water quality, specifically increasing total dissolved solid, pH, water colour, and it also degrades the vegetation quality. Vegetation quality is also degraded as indicated by decreasing of NDVI values (maximum NDVI in 1990 was 0. 70 and in 2016 it was 0. 48).

The main core of this work is the achievement of a methodological tool able {{to be used for}} vulnerability assessment in ttransboudary watersheds. Groundwaters’ vulnerability mapping was carried out by two different methodological approches: DRASTIC and DRASTIC Pesticide [1]. DRASTIC is a numerical index derived from ratings and weights assigned to seven parameters – Deep to water, net Recharge, Aquifer media, Soil media, Topography, Impact of the vadose zone and hidraulic Conductivity. The obtained values raises between 23 (not vulnerable) to 230 (highly vulnerable). Drastic Pesticide uses the same parameters with the reassignment of attributes’ weights to stress the importance of agricultural activities. DRASTIC’s map for Águeda watershed shows three spatially distributed vulnerability classes: low (102 - 119), moderate (120 - 139) and moderate to high (140 - 154). The low <b>vulnerable</b> <b>zones</b> occupy almost 78 % of the all area while the moderate <b>vulnerable</b> <b>zones</b> correspond to 21 % of the remaining area. The moderate to high <b>vulnerable</b> <b>zones</b> represents less than 1 % of the total area {{and it is}} localized in {{the central part of the}} Águeda watershed overlapping the tertiary sedimentary aquifer and the mostly populated area. DRASTIC Pesticide map shows four spatially distributed vulnerability classes: low (120 - 139), low to moderate (140 - 159), moderate to high (160 - 179) and high (180 - 195). The high proportion increases considerably in the central zone of the Águeda watershed representing more than 20 % of the land parceling. Although similar hydrogeological intrinsic characteristics are observed in the central watershed’s area obvious differences can be stressed when anthropogenic activities are taken into consideration.

A typology based on perceptions towards water quality management was developed using factor and cluster analysis techniques.

The apathists were indifferent towards the aims of the regulation and to water quality management in general.

The lack of engagement from the 'apathists', which represent around a third of the responses to the survey, is particularly problematic for policy makers.
