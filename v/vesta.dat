5|$|The largest {{asteroid}} to {{be a true}} {{member of}} a family (as opposed to an interloper in the case of Ceres with the Gefion family) is 4 <b>Vesta.</b> The <b>Vesta</b> family is believed to have formed {{as the result of a}} crater-forming impact on <b>Vesta.</b> Likewise, the HED meteorites may also have originated from <b>Vesta</b> as a result of this collision.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vesta</b> was at {{opposition}} {{again on}} 9 December 2012. According to Sky and Telescope magazine, this year <b>Vesta</b> came within about 6 degrees of 1 Ceres {{during the winter}} of 2012 and spring 2013. <b>Vesta</b> orbits the Sun in 3.63 years and Ceres in 4.6 years, so every 17 years <b>Vesta</b> overtakes Ceres (the last overtaking was in 1996). On December 1, 2012, <b>Vesta</b> had a magnitude of 6.6, but decreasing to 8.4 by May 1, 2013.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of <b>Vesta,</b> no further objects were discovered for 38 years, and the Solar System was thought to have eleven planets. However, in 1845, new asteroids started being discovered at a rapid pace, and by 1851 there were fifteen, {{each with its own}} symbol, in addition to the eight major planets (Neptune had been discovered in 1846). It soon became clear that it would be impractical to continue inventing new planetary symbols indefinitely, and some of the existing ones proved difficult to draw quickly. That year, the problem was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould, who suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery, and placing this number in a disk (circle) as the generic symbol of an asteroid. Thus, the fourth asteroid, <b>Vesta,</b> acquired the generic symbol ④. This was soon coupled with the name into an official number–name designation, ④ <b>Vesta,</b> as the number of minor planets increased. By 1858, the circle had been simplified to parentheses, (4) <b>Vesta,</b> which were easier to typeset. Other punctuation, such as 4) <b>Vesta</b> and 4, <b>Vesta,</b> was also used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949. Today, either <b>Vesta,</b> or, more commonly, 4 <b>Vesta,</b> is used.|$|E

5|$|Findings {{from the}} Dawn {{spacecraft}} have {{found evidence that}} the troughs that wrap around <b>Vesta</b> could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that <b>Vesta</b> has more complex geology than other asteroids. <b>Vesta</b> could have been classified as a dwarf planet if it had retained a spherical shape, and it has other qualities {{that lead to the}} thought it could be a protoplanet. The only thing that knocked it out of the category of a dwarf planet was the formation of two large impact basins at its southern pole. At the time of these impacts <b>Vesta</b> was not warm and plastic enough to return to a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|It is {{slightly}} larger than Pallas, though significantly more massive. <b>Vesta</b> is the last remaining rocky protoplanet (with a differentiated interior) {{of the kind that}} formed the terrestrial planets. Numerous fragments of <b>Vesta</b> were ejected by collisions one and two billion years ago that left two enormous craters occupying much of Vesta's southern hemisphere. Debris from these events has fallen to Earth as howardite–eucrite–diogenite (HED) meteorites, which have been a rich source of information about <b>Vesta.</b>|$|E

5|$|Its {{size and}} unusually bright surface make <b>Vesta</b> the {{brightest}} asteroid, {{and it is}} occasionally {{visible to the naked}} eye from dark skies (without light pollution). In May and June 2007, <b>Vesta</b> reached a peak magnitude of +5.4, the brightest since 1989. At that time, opposition and perihelion were only a few weeks apart. It will be brighter still at its 22 June 2018 opposition, reaching a magnitude of +5.3.|$|E
5|$|Less {{favorable}} oppositions during late autumn 2008 in the Northern Hemisphere {{still had}} <b>Vesta</b> at a magnitude of from +6.5 to +7.3.

40|$|<b>Vesta’s</b> {{surface is}} {{characterized}} by abundant impact craters, some with preserved ejecta blankets, large troughs extending around the equatorial region, enigmatic dark material, and widespread mass wasting, but as yet an absence of volcanic features. Abundant steep slopes indicate that impact-generated surface regolith is underlain by bedrock. Dawn observations confirm the large impact basin (Rheasilvia) at <b>Vesta’s</b> south pole and reveal evidence for an earlier, underlying large basin (Veneneia). <b>Vesta’s</b> geology displays morphological features characteristic of the Moon and terrestrial planets {{as well as those}} of other asteroids, underscoring <b>Vesta’s</b> unique role as a transitional solar system body...|$|R

40|$|This {{project is}} based upon a {{wondering}} about the Danish windmill producer, <b>Vestas,</b> and its descending marked share and earnings, in an expanding market {{in the period of}} 2008 - 2011. This report highlights a number of central determinants, which each will describe the cause of impact on <b>Vestas</b> descending market share and earnings. Thereby showing whether it is Vestas’s strategy towards competition, the Danish wind cluster or the energy policies that effects the descending development, <b>Vestas</b> has been going through. The financial crisis is another determinant included in this repport. It will be shown, which policies about sustainable energy that has been introduced in the period, and how these have affected <b>Vestas.</b> Hereafter it is shown which affect the Danish wind cluster and its geographical position and how it had an impact on <b>Vestas.</b> Finally we describe how, all the determinants combined have had an effect on <b>Vestas,</b> and whether or not, it is synergy of all these determinants that has proven to be the main reason...|$|R
5|$|Photometric {{observations}} of <b>Vesta</b> {{were made at}} the Harvard College Observatory in 1880–1882 and at the Observatoire de Toulouse in 1909.

50|$|In April 2016, <b>Vestas</b> {{installed}} a 900 kW quadrotor test wind turbine at Risø, made from 4 recycled 225 kW V29 turbines. Three months of testing {{have so far}} confirmed theoretical models. <b>Vestas</b> has no immediate plans of commercializing the prototype.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of the equatorial region of <b>Vesta</b> is sculpted {{by a series of}} concentric troughs. The largest is named Divalia Fossa (10–20km wide, 465km long). Despite the fact that <b>Vesta</b> is a one-seventh the size of the Moon, Divalia Fossa dwarfs the Grand Canyon. A second series, inclined to the equator, is found further north. The largest of the northern troughs is named Saturnalia Fossa (≈ 40km wide, > 370km long). These troughs are thought to be large-scale graben resulting from the impacts that created Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters, respectively. They are some of the longest chasms in the Solar System, nearly as long as Ithaca Chasma on Tethys. The troughs may be graben that formed after another asteroid collided with <b>Vesta,</b> a process that can happen only in a body that, like <b>Vesta,</b> is differentiated. Vesta's differentiation {{is one of the reasons}} why scientists consider it a protoplanet.|$|E
5|$|True orbital {{resonances}} between asteroids {{are considered}} unlikely; {{due to their}} small masses relative to their large separations, such relationships should be very rare. Nevertheless, <b>Vesta</b> is able to capture other asteroids into temporary 1:1 resonant orbital relationships (for periods up to 2 million years or more); about forty such objects have been identified. Decameter-sized objects detected {{in the vicinity of}} <b>Vesta</b> by Dawn may be such quasi-satellites rather than proper satellites.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vesta</b> is {{currently}} {{one of only}} six identified Solar System bodies of which we have physical samples, coming {{from a number of}} meteorites suspected to be Vestan fragments. It is estimated that 1 out of 16 meteorites originated from <b>Vesta.</b> The other identified Solar System samples are from Earth itself, meteorites from Mars, meteorites from the Moon, and samples returned from the Moon, the comet Wild 2, and the asteroid 25143 Itokawa.|$|E

5|$|<b>Vesta</b> is {{the only}} known intact {{asteroid}} that has been resurfaced in this manner. Because of this, some scientists refer to <b>Vesta</b> as a protoplanet. However, the presence of iron meteorites and achondritic meteorite classes without identified parent bodies indicates that there once were other differentiated planetesimals with igneous histories, which have since been shattered by impacts.|$|E
5|$|Compositional {{information}} from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate {{that the majority of}} the surface composition of <b>Vesta</b> is consistent with the composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within <b>Vesta.</b> The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Olbers {{discovered}} Pallas in 1802, {{the year}} after the discovery of Ceres. He proposed that the two objects were the remnants of a destroyed planet. He sent a letter with his proposal to the English astronomer William Herschel, suggesting that a search near the locations where the orbits of Ceres and Pallas intersected might reveal more fragments. These orbital intersections were located in the constellations of Cetus and Virgo. Olbers commenced his search in 1802, and on 29 March 1807 he discovered <b>Vesta</b> in the constellation Virgo—a coincidence, because Ceres, Pallas, and <b>Vesta</b> are not fragments of a larger body. Because the asteroid Juno had been discovered in 1804, this made <b>Vesta</b> the fourth object to be identified in the region that is now known as the asteroid belt. The discovery was announced in a letter addressed to German astronomer Johann H. Schröter dated 31 March. Because Olbers already had credit for discovering a planet (Pallas; at the time, the asteroids were considered to be planets), he gave the honor of naming his new discovery to German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, whose orbital calculations had enabled astronomers to confirm the existence of Ceres, the first asteroid, and who had computed the orbit of the new planet in the remarkably short time of 10 hours. Gauss decided on the Roman virgin goddess of home and hearth, <b>Vesta.</b>|$|E
