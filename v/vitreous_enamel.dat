5|$|In 2013 Mark Wallinger, {{an artist}} {{associated}} with the YBA movement, was invited to produce an artwork to mark the 150th anniversary of the London Underground. He devised a scheme which in which panels with designs of labyrinths in <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> were installed on all 270 Underground stations. The works are numbered according to {{the order in which}} their stations were visited in a particular record-breaking journey of 2009, which took in every station on the network. In all there 32 works in the series in the City of Westminster, one for every station except Paddington, where there are two panels.|$|E
5|$|Movable type: The polymath {{scientist}} and official Shen Kuo (1031–1095) of the Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{was the first}} to describe the process of movable type printing in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088. He attributed the innovation of reusable fired clay characters to a little-known artisan named Bi Sheng (990–1051). Bi had experimented with wooden type characters, but their use was not perfected until 1297 to 1298 with the model of the official Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333) of the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), who also arranged written characters by rhyme scheme on the surface of round table compartments. It was not until 1490 with the printed works of Hua Sui (1439–1513) of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) that the Chinese perfected metal movable type characters, namely bronze. The Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) scholar Xu Zhiding of Tai'an, Shandong developed <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> movable type printing in 1718.|$|E

25|$|The bonding {{between the}} glass or {{ceramics}} {{and the glass}} solder can be either covalent, or, more often, van der Waals. The seal can be leak-tight; glass soldering is frequently used in vacuum technology. Glass solders can be also used as sealants; a <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> coating on iron lowered its permeability to hydrogen 10 times. Glass solders are frequently used for glass-to-metal seals and glass-ceramic-to-metal seals.|$|E
25|$|Her {{remains were}} found in Vilnius Cathedral after a flood in 1931. To {{preserve}} her body during the long summer trip from Kraków to Vilnius, it was covered {{in a mixture of}} ash and burnt lime. While the wooden coffin rotted away, the lime hardened and formed a protective shell that preserved her bones rather well. She was buried with regal symbols (silver gilded crown, silver scepter, golden orb with a cross) and jewelry (long gold necklace, three gold rings; one of them, gifted to her by Sigismund Augustus, was covered with black <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> and had three stones – brilliant, ruby, and emerald). These and other artifacts were kept at Vilnius Cathedral, but they disappeared during World War II.|$|E

25|$|Following {{a review}} of 'national' signage in 1921 {{a limited number of}} warning and hazard {{information}} plates were enhanced by the use of symbols, rather than text only. Such symbols had been developed in continental Europe as early as 1909, but had been dismissed by the UK, which favoured the use of text. The symbols were simple silhouettes, easy to 'read' at a distance. Some were peculiarly British: 'SCHOOL' (and later 'CHILDREN') depicted by the flaming torch of knowledge. The government was to make increasing efforts to standardise road signs in the Road Traffic Act 1930 (RTA) and regulations of 1933, being finally consolidated with the publication of the 1934 Road Traffic Acts and Regulations handbook. These saw the end of the very individual black and yellow <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> AA signs (although the AA was still allowed to erect temporary direction signs, and still does). While the RSAC had ceased erecting signs, the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) had begun to do so to RTA specifications (save for the inclusion of the RAC badge) and was very active in this respect in the late-1930s.|$|E

500|$|David Dunbar Buick was a Scottish-born {{immigrant}} {{who moved to}} Detroit with his parents {{at the age of}} two in 1856–57. He quit school to supplement the family's income after his father's 1860 death. In the 1880s, he was a plumbing supplier in the Detroit area, inventing a process that created a cheaper white bathtub. Buick produced a method for permanently coating cast iron with <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> which allowed the production of [...] "white" [...] baths at lower cost. He later sold his plumbing business and the patents to American Standard. Using the profits from this sale, Buick started working on gasoline engines, and later automobiles. He eventually moved his operations from Detroit to the Flint Wagon Works. William Durant managed the fledgling Buick Manufacturing Company, making it the number one car-building company in the country by 1908. Durant later built on the foundation of Buick's company to create General Motors. In honor of Buick's contributions to Flint's manufacturing base, the Flint City Commission proposed naming I-475 after Buick. The freeway passed by the city's Buick plant and many of the employees would use the new freeway on their commutes to work. The Michigan Legislature passed Concurrent Resolution22 in 1969 to add the name.|$|E

50|$|Very {{little has}} come to us from {{what must have been}} an {{impressive}} body of Mosan murals.

Book illumination, {{like the rest of the}} arts, was at its zenith in the second half of the 12th century. The principal centres were the abbey of Saint Laurent in Liège and the abbeys of Stavelot and Lobbes. Another highly developed art was <b>vitreous</b> <b>enameling.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Enamel {{paint is}} paint that air dries to a hard, usually glossy, finish, used for coating {{surfaces}} that are outdoors or otherwise subject to hard wear or variations in temperature; {{it should not}} be confused with decorated objects in [...] "painted enamel", where <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> is applied with brushes and fired in a kiln. The name is something of a misnomer, as in reality, most commercially available enamel paints are significantly softer than either <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> or stoved synthetic resins, and are totally different in composition; <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> is applied as a powder or paste and then fired at high temperature. There is no generally accepted definition or standard for use of the term enamel paint, and not all enamel-type paints may use it.|$|E

The {{corrosion}} resistant oxide coatings, developed and applied by the conventional <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamelling</b> techniques, showed superior resistance {{to a range}} of mineral acids at various strengths and temperatures, alkaline solutions, boiling water and chrome plating so utions. These coatings possess considerable abrasion and impact resistance as well as high thermal shock resistance. The properties of the coating system have been studied in detail and found to be strongly dependent on composition and processing parameters. These coatings have been characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis and SEM studies. Some of the coating materials {{have been found to be}} biocompatible...|$|R

Tioxide pigments were then used in all kinds of paints (in 14 different grades of Tioxide), industrial finishes, floor coverings, plastics and rubber; in addition in artificial textiles, delicate paper and cosmetics particularly soaps. They were also employed in <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamels</b> on whiteware and baths, printing inks and pale leathers and their polishes.|$|R
25|$|Early {{road signs}} were usually cast iron, {{but this was}} {{increasingly}} displaced by cast aluminium in the 1930s. Cast signs were designed to be maintained by being repainted with the raised lettering and symbol easily picked out by an untrained hand. This sort of sign was sometimes given an element of night use by the inclusion of glass reflectors. An alternative to casting and painting was <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamelled</b> sheet iron or steel. In the 1950s cast signs were quickly displaced by sheet metal (usually aluminium) coated with adhesive plastics; these could be made reflective, famously by Scotchlite. Such signs had become almost universal by the reforms of the early 1960s.|$|R
