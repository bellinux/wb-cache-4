50|$|<b>Volumetric</b> <b>efficiencies</b> above 100% can {{be reached}} by using forced {{induction}} such as supercharging or turbocharging. With proper tuning, <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiencies</b> above 100% can also be reached by naturally aspirated engines. The limit for naturally aspirated engines is about 130%; these engines are typically of a DOHC layout with four valves per cylinder. This process is called inertial supercharging and uses the resonance of the intake manifold and the mass of the air to achieve pressures greater than atmospheric at the intake valve. With proper tuning (and dependent on the need for sound level control), VE's of up to 130% have been reported in various experimental studies.|$|R

These power levels are obtained through extremely high values of <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiencies</b> in tbe range of high engine speed, resulting from highly optimised gas exchange processes. In the present paper, a four cylinder, four valve per cylinder engine with a four-in-one exhaust is optimised for <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiencies</b> by using state-of-the-artcomputational methods. These computational metbods include stati c three dimensional computations {{as well as}} dynamic one and three dimensional computations.

30|$|<b>Volumetric</b> sweep <b>efficiency</b> is the {{fraction}} of the floodable portion of the reservoir swept or contacted by water. It {{is the product of}} the areal (EA) and vertical (EV) sweep (EVW[*]=[*]EA[*]×[*]EV). It is useful to compute the <b>volumetric</b> sweep <b>efficiency</b> of the injected water, as this assists in the management and calculation of future waterflood recovery potential in a mature waterflood. <b>Volumetric</b> sweep <b>efficiency</b> is important because it defines {{the fraction}} of the reservoir swept by the injected water (Cob and Marek 1997).|$|R
25|$|New {{developments}} in ceramic materials {{have been made}} with anti-ferroelectric ceramics. This material has a nonlinear antiferroelectric/ferroelectric phase change that allows increased energy storage with higher <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiency.</b> They are used for energy storage (for example, in detonators).|$|E
25|$|Class 1 ceramic {{capacitors}} {{have the}} lowest <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiency</b> among ceramic capacitors. This {{is the result of}} the relatively low permittivity (6 to 200) of the paraelectric materials. Therefore, class 1 capacitors have capacitance values in the lower range.|$|E
25|$|Polyvinylidene {{fluoride}} (PVDF) has a {{very high}} permittivity of 18 to 20, which allows large amounts of energy to be stored in a small space (<b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiency).</b> However, it has a Curie temperature of only 60nbsp&°C, which limits its usability. Film capacitors with PVDF are described for one very special application, in portable defibrillators.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantages}} of liquid methane as a jet engine fuel {{are that it}} has more specific energy than the standard kerosene mixes do and that its low temperature can help cool the air which the engine compresses for greater <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiency,</b> in effect replacing an intercooler. Alternatively, {{it can be used}} to lower the temperature of the exhaust.|$|E
25|$|When the {{pressure}} of the engine's intake air is increased, its temperature also increases. In addition, heat soak from the hot exhaust gases spinning the turbine will also heat the intake air. The warmer the intake air, the less dense, and the less oxygen available for the combustion event, which reduces <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Not only does excessive intake-air temperature reduce efficiency, it also leads to engine knock, or detonation, which is destructive to engines.|$|E
25|$|Class 3 {{barrier layer}} or semiconductive ceramic {{capacitors}} have very high permittivity, up to 50,000 {{and therefore a}} better <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiency</b> than class 2 capacitors. However, these capacitors have worse electrical characteristics, including lower accuracy and stability. The dielectric is characterized by very high nonlinear change of capacitance over the temperature range. The capacitance value additionally depends on the voltage applied. As well, they have very high losses and age over time.|$|E

30|$|PCP {{is widely}} used along with Electric {{submersible}} pump (ESP) and Gas lift (GS) operation for CHOPS using artificial lift systems (Cavender 2004). The foremost advantage of utilizing PCP is the high capacity of lifting highly viscous mixture of oil and sand, which initially contributed {{to the development of}} CHOPS. The wide usage of PCP in CHOPS is also based on its higher <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> lower lifting cost, lower capital cost, lower maintenance, application flexibility, and environmental benefits (Revard 1995).|$|R

25|$|Class 2 ceramic {{capacitors}} have a dielectric with a {{high permittivity}} and therefore a better <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiency</b> than class 1 capacitors, but lower accuracy and stability. The ceramic dielectric {{is characterized by a}} nonlinear change of capacitance over the temperature range. The capacitance value also depends on the applied voltage. They are suitable for bypass, coupling and decoupling applications or for frequency discriminating circuits where low losses and high stability of capacitance are less important. They typically exhibit microphony.|$|E
25|$|Power ceramic {{capacitors}} {{are mostly}} specified for {{much higher than}} 200 volt-amps. The great plasticity of ceramic raw material and the high dielectric strength of ceramics deliver solutions for many applications and are {{the reasons for the}} enormous diversity of styles within the family of power ceramic capacitors. These power capacitors have been on the market for decades. They are produced according to the requirements as class 1 power ceramic capacitors with high stability and low losses or class 2 power ceramic capacitors with high <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiency.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tantalum {{capacitors}} {{are manufactured}} from a powder of relatively pure elemental tantalum metal. A common {{figure of merit}} for comparing <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiency</b> of powders is expressed in capacitance (C, usually in μF) times volts (V) per gram (g). Since the mid-1980s, manufactured tantalum powders have exhibited around a ten-fold improvement in CV/g values (from approximately 20k to 200k). The typical particle size is between 2 and 10 μm. Figure 1 shows powders of successively finer grain, resulting in greater surface area per unit volume. Note the very great difference in particle size between the powders.|$|E

30|$|The <b>volumetric</b> sweep <b>efficiency</b> of EVW {{represents}} {{the fraction of}} the reservoir contacted by the injected water. If the water injection wells are also used as EOR injectors, the EOR injection is likely to sweep the same volume swept by the water. Conversely, (1 [*]−[*]Evw) defines {{that portion of the}} reservoir not swept by the injected water, and so identifies that portion of the reservoir where recoverable waterflood oil volumes are likely to exist (Cob and Marek 1997). Mathematical development of <b>volumetric</b> sweep <b>efficiency</b> is discussed in “Appendix A”.|$|R
30|$|The {{objective}} of mobility control {{is to improve}} the <b>volumetric</b> sweep <b>efficiency</b> of polymer floods. The oilfield responses are observed through an increase in injection pressure and reduced water cut (Mahani et al. 2011). The polymer solution slug would improve the <b>volumetric</b> sweep <b>efficiency,</b> resulting in a decrease in water cut; on the other hand, the polymer solution slug would lower the water injection capacity and the liquid producing capacity. The reduction of the liquid producing capacity generally took place in the initial stage of the polymer flooding process, and decreased slowly thereafter.|$|R
25|$|The {{double-sided}} metallized film is electrostatically field-free {{because the}} electrodes {{have the same}} voltage potential {{on both sides of}} the film, and therefore does not contribute to the total capacitance of the capacitor. This film can therefore be made of a different and less expensive material. For example, a polypropylene film capacitor with double-sided metallization on a polyester film carrier makes the capacitor not only cheaper but also smaller, because the thinner polyester foil improves the <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the capacitor. Film capacitors with a double-sided metallized film effectively have thicker electrodes for higher surge current handling, but still do retain their self-healing properties, in contrast to the film/foil capacitors.|$|E
25|$|The small {{physical}} dimensions of PET film capacitors {{are the result}} of a high relative permittivity of 3.3, combined with a relatively high dielectric strength leads to a relatively high <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiency.</b> This advantage of compactness comes with some disadvantages. The capacitance temperature dependence of polyester film capacitors is relatively high compared to other film capacitors, ±5% over the entire temperature range. The capacitance frequency dependence of polyester film capacitors compared with the other film capacitors is -3% in the range from 100nbsp&Hz to 100nbsp&kHz at the upper limit. Also, the temperature and frequency dependence of the dissipation factor are higher for polyester film capacitors compared with the other film capacitor types.|$|E
25|$|A {{four-stroke}} cylinder {{produces a}} power stroke only every other {{rotation of the}} crankshaft, with three strokes being pumping losses. This doubles the real surface-to-volume ratio for the four-stroke reciprocating piston engine and the displacement increased. The Wankel, therefore, has higher <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiency</b> and lower pumping losses through the absence of choking valves. Because of the quasi-overlap of the power strokes, that cause the smoothness of the engine and the avoidance of the four-stroke cycle in a reciprocating engine, the Wankel engine is very quick to react to power increases, giving a quick delivery of power when the demand arises, especially at higher rpm's. This difference is more pronounced when compared to four-cylinder reciprocating engines and less pronounced when compared to higher cylinder counts.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the great}} {{advantages}} of plastic films for capacitor fabrication is that plastic films have considerably fewer defects than paper sheets used in paper capacitors. This allows the manufacture of plastic film capacitors with only a single layer of plastic film, whereas paper capacitors need a double layer of paper. Plastic film capacitors were significantly smaller in physical size (better <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiency),</b> with the same capacitance value and the same dielectric strength as comparable paper capacitors. Then-new plastic materials also showed further advantages compared with paper. Plastic is much less hygroscopic than paper, reducing the deleterious effects of imperfect sealing. Additionally, most plastics are subject to fewer chemical changes over long periods, providing long-term stability of their electrical parameters. Since around 1980, paper and metallized paper capacitors (MP capacitors) have almost completely been replaced by PET film capacitors for most low-power DC electronic applications. Paper is now used only in RFI suppression or motor run capacitors, or as a mixed dielectric combined with polypropylene films in large AC and DC capacitors for high-power applications.|$|E

2500|$|In {{naturally}} aspirated piston engines, intake gases are drawn or [...] "pushed" [...] into the engine by atmospheric pressure filling the volumetric void {{caused by the}} downward stroke of the piston (which creates a low-pressure area), similar to drawing liquid using a syringe. The amount of air actually inspired, compared with the theoretical amount if the engine could maintain atmospheric pressure, is called <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The objective of a turbocharger is to improve an engine's <b>volumetric</b> <b>efficiency</b> by increasing density of the intake gas (usually air) allowing more power per engine cycle.|$|E
