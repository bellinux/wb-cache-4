25|$|The {{design of}} the rear {{suspension}} made for poor ride quality and, as the Board discovered, made the <b>vehicles</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> experience rear wheel spin. This resulted in an accident in May 1986 when the driver of Cub no. 611 lost control and the vehicle crashed into a tree, with four of the occupants ending up in hospital.|$|R
5000|$|Video <b>tolling</b> (sometimes {{referred}} <b>to</b> as video billing) {{is a form}} {{of electronic}} toll collection, which uses video or still images of a vehicle's license plate <b>to</b> identify a <b>vehicle</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> pay a road toll. The system dispenses with collection of road tolls using road-side cash or payment card methods, and may be used in conjunction with [...] "all electronic" [...] open road <b>tolling,</b> <b>to</b> allow drivers without an RFID device (often referred to as a [...] "Tag") <b>to</b> use the <b>toll</b> road.|$|R
5000|$|While {{adequate}} for {{transport by road}} in Europe, the flimsies proved to be extremely unsatisfactory during the North African Campaign and severely hampered {{the operation of the}} British Eighth Army. The transport of fuel over rough terrain often resulted in much of the fuel (as much as 25 percent) being lost as the containers were easily punctured. Leakages also made <b>vehicles</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> catch fire. Cargo ships loaded with fuel in flimsies were also dangerous, with leaking fuel accumulating in cargo holds. At least one such ship exploded.|$|R

Serious road accidents can occur as a direct result, especially on those roads where vehicle speeds are greater.|$|R
50|$|On being engaged, Armtrac {{erected a}} number of {{prominent}} notices warning those that parked in the area without authority or permission that it was private property and their <b>vehicles</b> were <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> being wheel clamped and might, also, be removed. The notices made clear that a release fee must be paid before a clamp was removed and that additional fees had to be paid if the vehicle was towed away. The prominence of the notices and {{the simplicity of the}} message they sought to convey was never at issue during the ensuing case.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Through {{this article}} we are {{offering}} a global view of a theory that explains and contributes {{to the understanding of}} the position of ethnic groups in the United States within the social hierarchy. This research is focused toward a comparative analysis of Mexican and Chinese groups starting considering the following Weberian statements: a) one that considers the influence of ideas and religious beliefs in the economic behavior of individuals, b) and, another one that conceives religions as ethical <b>vehicles</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> inhibit or stimulate the process of social stratification. In sum, this deals trying to consider the influence of diverse elements of religious culture in the makeup of certain economic behavior and context which is capable of vitalizing or hindering group dynamism in the social scale. This behavior is remarkably related to: a) money in all its modalities, savings, expenses, investments, loans, etc., b) work and entrepreneur business, and c) family and communitarian solidarity. We also would like to emphasize on problems stemming from the practical applications of theory and method to the above mentioned phenomenon, emphasizing the productivity of concepts and analytical categories which are representative of a Methodological Individualism and Rational General Theory...|$|R
50|$|The Act made {{changes to}} the MOT vehicle test. Previously <b>vehicles</b> had been <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> annual testing ten years after first registration. This was reduced to three years from first registration. The Act also {{introduced}} maximum driving hours for goods drivers, and also allowed {{the introduction of the}} tachograph to record driving periods, despite the resistance of the trade unions, which called them 'the spy in the cab'!.|$|R
25|$|Today, all {{funding for}} state {{highways}} and around 50% {{of funding for}} local roads comes directly from road users through the National Land Transport Fund. Road user revenue directed to the fund includes all fuel excise duty on LPG and CNG, around 55% of revenue from fuel excise duty on petrol, all revenue from road user charges (a prepaid distance/weight licence that all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes, and all non petrol/LPG/CNG <b>vehicles</b> are <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> pay) and most non-ACC revenue from motor vehicle registration and licensing fees. In addition, {{in the last three}} years the government has increasingly allocated additional funds to land transport, to the extent that today the total expenditure by the NZ Transport Agency on land transport projects exceeds road tax revenue collected. The remainder of funding for local city and district roads primarily comes from local authority property rates.|$|R
2500|$|Considerable disquiet was {{expressed}} {{soon after the}} opening of the M6 Toll at signage which directed drivers making local journeys onto the toll road replaced older signs. As well as incurring toll charges, the new routes were longer than the original routes leading to accusations that this was just a ploy to increase traffic on the M6 Toll. Similar accusations have been made about traffic signs on the M6 that announce [...] "M6 TOLL CLEAR", even when the M6 is also clear, that are under the control of Midland Expressway Ltd. These issues are mentioned on the M6 Toll FAQ pages, with explanations which emphasise that all drivers using the road are still <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> pay the <b>toll.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With the {{advantage}} of high energy density, long cycle life and environmental friendliness, Lithium-ion battery has become a promising power source for hybrid and electric <b>vehicles,</b> which are <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> two kinds of failure, overcharge and overdischarge. Because of the capability of detecting multiple faults, Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) method was applied to a model-based fault detection of a lithium-ion battery with a two-order linear electrical model. Parameters that represent normal-mode and faulty-mode of the battery were obtained {{by a series of}} experiments, and three Kalman filters were designed thereafter. Finally, simulation verified the performance of the MMAE algorithm on fault detection of these two kinds of fault and it is shown that this technique is able to discern these faults rapidly and accurately. ...|$|R

2500|$|The old {{bridge was}} narrow, {{suitable}} for pedestrians only and <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> flooding. [...] An Act of Parliament of 1817 enabled its replacement by a superior structure.

Approximately 35 % of Taiwan’s manufacturing sector export products are <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> import duty in TPP member economies, with products <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> import duty of more than 5 % representing approximately 13 % of Taiwan’s total exports.
