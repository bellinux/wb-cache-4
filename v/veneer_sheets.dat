40|$|Genetic {{improvement}} of wood properties affecting {{the quality of}} pulpwood and peeled veneer products is of general interest to tree breeders worldwide. If the wood properties of Eucalyptus nitens (H. Deane & Maiden) Maiden are under genetic control and the correlations between them are favourable, {{it may be possible}} to breed to simultaneously improve the plantation resource for both products. Acoustic wave velocity (AWV) measured in standing trees can predict wood stiffness, basic density, and kraft pulp yield (KPY) and therefore has the potential for use in tree breeding programs. From an E. nitens progeny trial in Tasmania, 540 trees were selected for rotary peeling. Of the wood properties assessed, there were significant differences among races in diameter, stem straightness, standing-tree, log, and billet AWV, and near infrared predicted cellulose content (CC). All traits displayed significant within-race genetic variation, and genetic correlations between AWV and <b>veneer</b> <b>sheet</b> modulus of elasticity (MOE) and between AWV and KPY and CC were strongly positive and highly significant. A similar relationship was found between <b>veneer</b> <b>sheet</b> MOE and KPY and between diameter at breast height and <b>veneer</b> <b>sheet</b> MOE. Basic density was genetically correlated with AWV and <b>veneer</b> <b>sheet</b> MOE. Results indicate that it should be possible for breeders to simultaneously improve properties in pulpwood and peeled veneer products and that AWV measured in the standing tree shows promise as a breeding selection criterion for both pulpwood and peeled veneer products...|$|R

40|$|Eucalyptus nitens {{is widely}} planted for pulpwood, and {{increasingly}} also for solid-wood timber products, in cool-temperate climates. This thesis investigated {{the potential of}} tree breeding to improve the properties of E. nitens grown for sawn boards, pulpwood and veneer products. Two studies were undertaken using a 14 - 15 year old E. nitens provenanceprogeny trial established in Tasmania and comprising 420 open-pollinated families collected from three native races. In the first study, methods were developed to track the identities of 560 pedigreed trees through harvesting, transportation and sawmill processing. A second study tracked 548 trees from the same trial through a rotary peeled veneer production system. Genetic parameters were estimated {{for a total of}} 20 tree, log and wood traits relevant to sawn board, veneer and pulpwood products. Genetic differences among races of E. nitens were significant in wood stiffness, growth, stem form and pulpwood traits, but not significant for log end-splitting and sawn board checking traits. The Southern race had the most favourable mean values. Significant additive genetic variation within races was observed in all traits except log-taper, demonstrating that the quality of plantation-grown E. nitens wood products could be improved through breeding. Strongly positive genetic correlations among diameter at breast height (DBH) at ages 4, 9 and 14 years and between DBH all ages and the traits survival, log volume and stem straightness, demonstrated that early-age selection for DBH would not compromise stem straightness and would improve product volume recovery. Log end-splitting was under moderate genetic control but there was a negative genetic correlation between end-splitting and solidwood product volume. Sawn board and <b>veneer</b> <b>sheet</b> stiffness was highly heritable, and strongly correlated with acoustic wave velocity (AWV), measured in standing trees and logs. Consistent with previous studies in E. nitens, wood basic density, near infra red-(NIR) predicted kraft pulp yield (KPY) and cellulose content (CC) had moderate-to-high heritabilities, although coefficients of additive genetic variation for these traits were small. Estimated genetic correlations between standing tree AWV and each of the traits <b>veneer</b> <b>sheet</b> modulus of elasticity (MOE), sawn-board MOE, KPY, CC and basic density were highly significant and strongly positive, suggesting that standing tree AWV could be adopted as an indirect non-destructive selection criterion for improving solid-wood product stiffness, while simultaneously improving wood chemical traits favoured by the pulpwood industry. Basic density had no significant genetic relationship with KPY and CC, although other studies have reported moderate to strong significant values. Surface and internal checking in sawn boards, which are important defects leading to value downgrade, were shown to be under moderate levels of additive genetic control. Internal checking in wedges cut from log disks and in wafer sections cross-cut from processed boards were strongly and positively genetically correlated. However, the genetic correlation of checking traits with density and AWV were generally not significant. Work presented in this thesis clearly demonstrates the potential for genetic improvement of E. nitens for pulpwood, sawn-boards and veneer production. A new method of tracking trees in processing studies has been established. Methods for assessing checking have been developed, and the utility of nondestructive AWV and NIR techniques has been confirmed for use in E. nitens breeding programs, aiming to simultaneously improve the quality and recovered volume of pulpwood and solid-wood products...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of thisstudywas {{to evaluate the}} use potential of nine species of Eucalyptus for production of <b>veneer</b> <b>sheets</b> and multilaminated plywood panels. Veneers were cut using a pilot laminating lathe to a nominal thickness of 2. 0 mm. Analysis included finding values of overall yield and yield according to three quality classes for the nine relevant species. Plywood panels were manufactured in a laboratory, consisting of five 2. 0 mm <b>veneer</b> <b>sheets</b> which were bonded together with phenol-formaldehyde resin at a weight of 360 g/m 2 (double line). The panels were compressed using a specific pressure of 10 kgf/cm 2, a temperature of 140 ºC and a pressing time of 10 minutes. Results indicated that, with the exception of E. phaeotricha and E. pellita, all other Eucalyptus species had above 50 % average veneer yield after lamination. Results of glue line shear testing and static bending parallel and perpendicular demonstrated that species Eucalyptus grandis, Eucalyptus saligna, Eucalyptus dunnii, Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus viminalis, Eucalyptus robusta and Eucalyptus pellita have great potential within the parameters of this study for use in the production of <b>veneer</b> <b>sheets</b> and plywood panels intended for outdoor use...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Past {{research}} and industrial sources have implied that preheating Douglas-fir Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco prior to peeling veneer was economically feasible. To test this, {{the effect of}} treatment temperature on veneer yield and thickness variation for three diameter classes of low grade Douglas-fir logs was studied and related {{to the cost of}} preheating. Test results showed that pre-heating No. 3 Douglas-fir Sawmill logs to a peel temperature range of 50 °F to 120 °F had no statistical effect on veneer value, total yield, grade yield, or <b>veneer</b> <b>sheet</b> width yield of 12, 18, and 24 inch diameter blocks. Block diameter, however was found to have a highly significant effect on veneer value expressed as the value of the percentage of the block volume recovered as marketable green veneer. Eighteen inch diameter blocks had the greatest total, grade, and full sheet recovery per unit volume of initial block diameter. Twenty-four inch diameter blocks had the least recovery and value while the 12 inch blocks were intermediate. Veneer thickness variation was found to be independent of peel temperature but significantly influenced by block diameter. The reason for the block diameter-veneer yield and thickness variation interaction was not investigated but was probably due to a complex interaction of wood properties at various diameters and the changing in the lathe setting angles due to the differences between diameters. A microprocessor based data acquisition system was built to record the output of a non-contact infrared temperature sensing instrument that measured the block temperature profile during peeling. The variability of temperature found within the blocks suggest the effects of heating would vary greatly for any one block. The microprocessor proved to be a valuable research tool that has many research uses but more importantly, many industrial process control applications. The equation describing unsteady state transfer for an infinitely long cylinder was solved via numerical analysis to theoretically estimate heating times for veneer blocks.

40|$|Executive Summary This project, {{titled the}} {{potential}} to recover higher value veneer products from fibre managed plantation eucalypts and broaden market opportunities for this resource, has two parts: • Part A investigates the genetics and wood quality of obtained from E. nitens and E. globulus grown in Tasmania and the genetic parameters that affect quality of rotarypeeled veneer, plywood and LVL. • Part B investigates marketing rotary-peeled veneer recovered from native pulp woodin Tasmania. It looks at {{the potential to}} develop niche markets for the resultant products. The objectives of this Part A {{of the study were}} to: 1. Provide baseline data on veneer quality and plywood properties of fibre-managed plantation E. nitens grown in Tasmania. 2. Identify the genetic parameters that affect quality of rotary-peeled veneer and plywood to guide selection of families for future breeding programs and to examine the compatibility of breeding for potentially conflicting objectives. 3. Assess the effectiveness of an acoustic sorting strategy and potential gain from segregation of logs for veneer and plywood production The key outcomes, industry benefits and indication to future work included: 1. This project presents Australia’s first large scale peeling trial for plantation E. nitensproviding significant baseline data on plywood properties and veneer quality and the genetic parameters that underpin them. Results will help guide future breeding programs and direct research towards key processing parameters most likely to improve veneer quality and recovery and therefore commercial opportunities for peeled products from this resource. 2. Glue bond tests (for exterior use) were generally promising. Further work is required to improve and understand bond quality issues in younger (16 yr) E. nitens resource. 3. Shear properties were poor for all resources tested at UTAS and EWPAA facilities,limiting F-Grade classification to F 8 and below. Assuming shear strength could be increased beyond the observed limiting levels through process optimisation the resources tested would classify with F-Grades of F 34 (E. glob), F 17 (E. ni 26), F 17 (TasOak / E. ni 16), F 17 (TasOak / P. rad) and F 11 (E. ni 16). 4.

40|$|Hypervelocity {{collisions}} of asteroids onto planetary {{bodies have}} catastrophic {{effects on the}} target rocks {{through the process of}} shock metamorphism. The resulting features, impact craters, are circular depressions with a sharp rim surrounded by an ejecta blanket of variably shocked rocks. With increasing impact energy, the inner crater cavity can preserve complex morphologies including terraced walls, central uplifts, and melted rocks. The lack of erosion due to the absence of water or an atmosphere makes the Moon the perfect target to study impact crater processes, in particular the distribution of highly shocked materials within impact craters of different sizes. This study focuses on the characterization and distribution of highly shocked impact melt deposits using multispectral satellite datasets around three complex craters on the farside of the Moon. The study sites have varying morphologies of central uplifts on the crater floor: 1) the 81 km Olcott crater has a cluster of peak hills; 2) Kovalevskaya crater is a 113 km diameter complex crater with a central peak; and 3) Schrodinger basin has a central peak ring. Models propose that the collapse of crater walls and central uplifts during the final stages of crater formation determine where much of the melt rich rocks are eventually emplaced. The results {{of this study indicate that}} for increasing crater sizes, the volume of melt-rich rocks generated also increases – at rates greater than model estimates. Impact melt deposits are emplaced beyond the crater rims at each of the sites and preserve a range of morphologies, including melt <b>veneers,</b> melt <b>sheet,</b> and ponded deposits. The regional and local topography, together with crater modification processes greatly affect where the impact melts are finally emplaced. The compositional analyses of the farside crust, using multispectral reflectance spectroscopy in the UV-VIS-NIR range, indicates that there is increasing evidence of highly mafic compositions (i. e., rocks rich in high-Ca pyroxene, olivine, spinel) intercalated within the original crustal highlands (rocks rich in plagioclase feldspar, and low-Ca pyroxenes) on the lunar farside, proving that the lunar farside is a far more geologically complicated terrain than originally assumed...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the out-of-plane seismic performance of anchored brick veneer with wood-frame backup wall systems, to evaluate prescriptive design requirements and current construction practices. Prescriptive requirements for the design and construction of anchored brick veneer are currently provided by the Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC) Building Code, the International Residential Code (IRC) for Oneand Two-Family Dwellings, and the Brick Industry Association (BIA) Technical Notes. Laboratory tests were conducted on brick-tie-wood subassemblies, comprising two bricks with a corrugated sheet metal tie either nail- or screw-attached to a wood stud, permitting an evaluation of the stiffness, strength, and failure modes for a local portion of a veneer wall system, rather than just of a single tie by itself. Then, full-scale brick veneer wall specimens (two one-story solid walls, as well as a one-and-a-half story wall with a window opening and a gable region) were tested under static and dynamic out-of-plane loading on a shake table. The shake table tests captured the performance of brick veneer wall systems, including interaction and load-sharing between the brick <b>veneer,</b> corrugated <b>sheet</b> metal ties, and wood-frame backup. Finally, all of these test results were used to develop finite element models of brick veneer wall systems, including nonlinear inelastic properties for the tie connections. The experimental and analytical studies showed that the out-of-plane seismic performance of residential anchored brick veneer walls is generally governed by: tensile stiffness and strength properties of the tie connections, as controlled by tie installation details; overall grid spacing of the tie connections, especially for tie installation along the edges and in the upper regions of walls; and, overall wall geometric variations. Damage limit states for single-story residential brick veneer wall systems were established from the experimental and analytical studies as a function of tensile failure of key tie connections, and the seismic fragility of this form of construction was then evaluated. Based on the overall findings, it is recommended that codes incorporate specific requirements for tie connection installation along all brick veneer wall edges, as well as for tie connection installation at reduced spacings in the upper regions of wall panels and near stiffer regions of the backup. Residential anchored brick veneer construction should as a minimum be built in accordance with the current prescriptive code requirements and recommendations, throughout low to moderate seismicity regions of the central and eastern U. S., whereas non-compliant methods of construction commonly substituted in practice are generally not acceptable. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

Commercially produced particleboard samples were laminated with such compressed <b>veneer</b> <b>sheets.</b> The density, 2 -h and 24 -h water absorption (WA) and thickness swelling (TS), bending strength (MOR), and modulus of elasticity (MOE) in the parallel and perpendicular directions to grain orientation were measured. The results showed that all of the particleboards laminated with compressed veneer had higher MOR and MOE values compared to unlaminated particleboard and particleboard laminated with non-compressed veneer. In the sandwiched panels, particleboards laminated with <b>veneer</b> <b>sheets</b> and compressed at a pressure of 4 MPa and a temperature of 150 oC had the highest MOR and MOE values. The MOR and MOE values decreased with increasing temperatures higher than 150 oC. The TS value for 2 -h and 24 -h immersion times decreased with increasing press temperature. The findings of this work could provide some insight in producing sandwich-type panels with improved properties. It appears that compressed veneer using different press temperatures and pressures could be considered as an alternative way of developing sandwich-type products with satisfactory structural properties...|$|E
30|$|In general, high-stiffness {{trees had}} higher density and smaller diameters with taper less than 1.2  cm m- 1. However, trees with smaller diameters produce less veneer. As {{a general rule}} of thumb, the number of sheets in the butt veneer bolt can be {{estimated}} from 80 % of the diameter, less 6.5 sheets for each unit of taper, {{and the number of}} <b>veneer</b> <b>sheets</b> in the tree derived by multiplying that number by 5. Thus there is a trade-off between forestry practices that target high value (stiffness) production and those that target high volume production.|$|E
30|$|Felled {{trees were}} {{crosscut}} into 10.67  m long logs, from which two 5.33  m mill-length logs were obtained. Each mill-length log was crosscut into two veneer bolts (peeler blocks) which were steamed and peeled into veneer until the core measured approximately 8.9  cm in diameter. The <b>veneer</b> <b>sheets</b> were tracked during the peeling process, allowing each sheet to be uniquely {{traced back to}} the veneer bolt and consequently to the position within the bolt, log, and parent tree, thus enabling the construction of internal stiffness maps for each tree (after Todoroki et al. 2012).|$|E
