Fuzzy statistics method was proposed in this paper to subjectively analyze, statistically modeling and quantitatively calculate the failure probability of internal combustion engine forklift. The fuzzy statistics probability of the internal combustion engine forklift was obtained, which had the well consistency with the probability in actual conditions. The method purposed here can provide a basis for the <b>vehicle</b> <b>equipments</b> support, and also can provide a new method to analyze the failure probability of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>equipments...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{architecture}} of VCC consists of mainly three layers, <b>vehicle</b> <b>equipment,</b> communication, and the cloud [11]. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>equipment</b> includes sensors to monitor driver, on board processors, storage, and OBU (On Board Unit). OBUs, at the communication layer, connect <b>vehicle</b> <b>equipment</b> to deployed infrastructure (3 G, 4 G/long-term evolution (LTE), Direct Short-Range Communication (DSRC)) to exchange information. This communication is named as V 2 I. Similarly, V 2 V makes inter-vehicle communication possible using DSRC. The last layer, the cloud, spans further three layers, including cloud infrastructure, cloud applications, and the cloud platform. The cloud infrastructure has mainly two modules. One for computation {{and the other}} for storage. For instance, some computation can be performed locally on the sensed data before storing it in the cloud. Architecture of VCC is shown in Fig.  1.|$|R

50|$|Rather than a UN-style {{system of}} type approvals, the US and Canadian auto safety {{regulations}} {{operate on the}} principle of self-certification, wherein the manufacturer or importer of a vehicle or item of motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>equipment</b> certifies—i.e., asserts and promises—that the <b>vehicle</b> or <b>equipment</b> complies with all applicable federal or Canada Motor Vehicle Safety, bumper and antitheft standards. No prior verification is required by a governmental agency or authorised testing entity before the <b>vehicle</b> or <b>equipment</b> can be imported, sold, or used. If reason develops to believe the certification wasfalse or improper — i.e., that the <b>vehicle</b> or <b>equipment</b> does not in fact comply — then authorities may conduct tests and, if a noncompliance is found, order a recall and/or other corrective and/or punitive measures. <b>Vehicle</b> and <b>equipment</b> makers are permitted to appeal such penalties, but this is a difficult direction. Non-compliances found that are arguably without effect to highway safety may be petitioned to skip recall (remedy and notification) requirements for vehicles already produced.|$|R
