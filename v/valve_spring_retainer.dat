5000|$|The {{desmodromic}} system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to overcome the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass and all of the <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> <b>retainer</b> mass. However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms per valve, so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use roller tappets in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate hydraulic valve lash adjusters in a desmodromic system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as valve lash is typically set using a shim under a cam follower.|$|E

5000|$|Power: [...] @ 6000 rpm*Torque: 510 Nm @ 4800 rpm A {{modified}} version of the LS1 enhanced by Callaway Cars Incorporated, this engine was used on the VTII, VX and Y series of GTS models as well as the SV300. Differences from the LS1 included ported cylinder heads, larger throttle body, revised camshaft, remapped ECU, titanium <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> <b>retainers,</b> upgraded <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> and <b>valves.</b> The compression ratio was also lowered slightly to 9.95:1 and the engine ran MAFless. In HSV models, this engine was used with a higher than standard 3.91:1 final drive ratio.|$|R
50|$|This {{engine was}} a {{reworked}} {{version of the}} F20C, a new rod stroke ratio the redline was dropped to 8000RPM to produce better low end torque. The camshafts were also revised along with <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> and <b>retainers.</b> All these changes increased the peak torque by 6% however the power output stayed the same.|$|R
5000|$|The final {{model of}} the above initial series was the MAE in 1965, when new rules were {{introduced}} in Formula 3 allowing up to [...] engines with 36mm intake restrictor plate. MAE used one barrel of a two barrel Weber IDA downdraft carburetor with the other barrel blanked off. The domination of this engine was absolute as long as these regulations lasted until 1968. As Cosworth had a serious difficulty meeting the demand, the MAE was mainly sold as a kit. This experience led to the later FVA/DFV contract to be drawn where the responsibility of development rested with Cosworth, and the manufacturing right and responsibility rested with Ford. There also were some specially cast iron heads with similar dimensions to these brazed heads with Titanium alloy <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> <b>retainers</b> called the 'Screamer Head' for MAE in later years.|$|R
50|$|Engines must utilize Volkswagen {{series type}} 1, 1600cc, U.S. model sedan {{components}} and dimensions. Compression ratio and camshaft duration are unlimited. Stock dual-port cylinder heads cannot be ported or otherwise modified other than by flycutting for compression and 3-angle valve job. 1-piece stainless steel valves are allowed. Valve train {{is open for}} <b>valve</b> <b>springs,</b> <b>retainers,</b> locks, pushrods, and lifters; however, stock rocker arms must be utilized and their lift ratio must remain stock 1.1:1. Reciprocating assembly must be stock Volkswagen components but may be balanced. In {{the case of the}} connecting rods: one rod must remain untouched and the other 3 rods may be balanced to match. Pistons may be interchanged to forged, and engine cases may be machined for compression. Full flow oiling, oil galley plugs, case gussets, shuffle pinning, oil squirters, bronze lifter bores are all common case modifications. A top quality type 1, 1600cc engine will produce approximately 85 hp and withstand 5000-6000 rpm operation {{during the course of a}} full-length event, sometimes lasting over 25 hours.|$|R

5000|$|Cage {{and shell}} {{reinforcement}} were done by Matter France. F7R engine was tuned by Sodemo and produced around 250 hp in early evolutions (around 275 hp for last evolutions with destroked engine). Main {{difference to the}} Gr.A car {{was the use of}} individual throttle bodies and even wilder cams. Other differences include modified head for improved gas flow and modified block for better cooling. Extremely wild cams with maximum lift up to 15 mm required the use of solid lifters and titanium <b>valves,</b> <b>springs</b> and <b>retainers.</b> Pistons and rods were made by Pankl. Pistons were a forged [...] "slipper" [...] design and rods were forged H section with custom 150 mm length to compensate for different piston compression height. Compression ratio was 12.5:1 and ran on special racing fuel. Exhaust manifold was a 4-2-1 design and was made from Inconel alloy. Clutch was made by AP Racing.|$|R
50|$|Poppet valves {{typically}} require small coil <b>springs,</b> appropriately named <b>valve</b> <b>springs,</b> to {{keep them}} closed when not actuated by the camshaft. They {{are attached to the}} valve stem ends, seating within <b>spring</b> <b>retainers.</b> Other mechanisms can be used in place of <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> to keep the valves closed: Formula 1 engines employ pneumatic <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> in which pneumatic pressure closes the valves, while motorcycle manufacturer Ducati uses desmodromic valve drive which mechanically close the valves.|$|R
25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the <b>spring</b> <b>retainer</b> (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> by exerting force on the <b>spring</b> <b>retainer</b> which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the <b>retainer,</b> <b>spring</b> and <b>valve</b> can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> compressor above the valve stem should free the <b>retainer</b> allowing the <b>springs</b> to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the <b>spring</b> <b>retainer</b> rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|R

50|$|Shot peening is {{a crucial}} process in spring making. Types of springs include leaf springs, {{extension}} springs, and compression springs. The most widely used application are for engine <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> (compression springs) due to high cyclic fatigue. In an OEM <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> application, the mechanical design combined with some shot peening ensures longevity. Automotive makers are shifting to more high performance higher stressed <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> designs as engines evolve. In aftermarket high performance <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> applications, the need for controlled and multi-step shot peening is a requirement to withstand extreme surface stresses that sometimes exceeds material specifications. The fatigue life of an extreme performance spring (NHRA, IHRA) can be as short as two passes on a 1/4 mile drag racing track before relaxation or failure occurs.|$|R

50|$|The common <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> {{system is}} {{satisfactory}} for traditional mass-produced engines {{that do not}} rev highly and are of a design that requires low maintenance. At the period of initial desmodromic development, <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> were a major limitation on engine performance because they would break from metal fatigue. Vacuum melt processes developed in the 1950s helped remove impurities in the steel used to make <b>valve</b> <b>springs,</b> although after sustained operation above 8000 RPM often springs would still fail. The desmodromic system was devised to remedy this problem. Furthermore, as maximum RPM increases, higher spring force is required to prevent valve float, leading to increased cam drag and higher wear on the parts at all speeds, problems addressed by the desmodromic mechanism.|$|R
