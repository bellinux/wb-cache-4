Leaning on his oar he lent the music of a mellow voice {{to the words of}} a German Volkslied, and launched a fleet of echoes such as any tuneful <b>vintager</b> might have sent floating down the Rhine. Sylvia was no weeper, but as she listened, all the day's happiness which had been pent up in her heart found vent in sudden tears, that streamed down noiseless and refreshing as a warm south rain. Why they came she could not tell, for neither song nor singer possessed the power to win so rare a tribute, and at another time, she would have restrained all visible expression of this indefinable yet sweet emotion. Mark and Moor had joined in the burden of the song, and when that was done took up another; but Sylvia only sat and let her tears flow while they would, singing at heart, though her eyes were full and her cheeks wet faster than the wind could kiss them dry.|$|E

[...] For 'tis the nicest touch of human honour, [...] When some ethereal and high-favouring donor [...] Presents immortal bowers to mortal sense; [...] As now 'tis done to thee, Endymion. Hence [...] 440 [...] Was I in no wise startled. So recline [...] Upon these living flowers. Here is wine, [...] Alive with sparkles--never, I aver, [...] Since Ariadne was a <b>vintager,</b> [...] So cool a purple: taste these juicy pears, [...] Sent me by sad Vertumnus, when his fears [...] Were high about Pomona: here is cream, [...] Deepening to richness from a snowy gleam; [...] Sweeter than that nurse Amalthea skimm'd [...] For the boy Jupiter: and here, undimm'd [...] 450 [...] By any touch, {{a bunch of}} blooming plums [...] Ready to melt between an infant's gums: [...] And here is manna pick'd from Syrian trees, [...] In starlight, by the three Hesperides. [...] Feast on, and meanwhile I will let thee know [...] Of all these things around us." [...] He did so, [...] Still brooding o'er the cadence of his lyre; [...] And thus: [...] "I need not any hearing tire [...] By telling how the sea-born goddess pin'd [...] For a mortal youth, and how she strove to bind [...] 460 [...] Him all in all unto her doting self. [...] Who {{would not be so}} prison'd? but, fond elf, [...] He was content to let her amorous plea [...] Faint through his careless arms; content to see [...] An unseiz'd heaven dying at his feet; [...] Content, O fool! to make a cold retreat, [...] When on the pleasant grass such love, lovelorn, [...] Lay sorrowing; when every tear was born [...] Of diverse passion; when her lips and eyes [...] Were clos'd in sullen moisture, and quick sighs [...] 470 [...] Came vex'd and pettish through her nostrils small. [...] Hush! no exclaim--yet, justly mightst thou call [...] Curses upon his head.--I was half glad, [...] But my poor mistress went distract and mad, [...] When the boar tusk'd him: so away she flew [...] To Jove's high throne, and by her plainings drew [...] Immortal tear-drops down the thunderer's beard; [...] Whereon, it was decreed he should be rear'd [...] Each summer time to life. Lo! this is he, [...] That same Adonis, safe in the privacy [...] 480 [...] Of this still region all his winter-sleep. [...] Aye, sleep; for when our love-sick queen did weep [...] Over his waned corse, the tremulous shower [...] Heal'd up the wound, and, with a balmy power, [...] Medicined death to a lengthened drowsiness: [...] The which she fills with visions, and doth dress [...] In all this quiet luxury; and hath set [...] Us young immortals, without any let, [...] To watch his slumber through. 'Tis well nigh pass'd, [...] Even to a moment's filling up, and fast [...] 490 [...] She scuds with summer breezes, to pant through [...] The first long kiss, warm firstling, to renew [...] Embower'd sports in Cytherea's isle. [...] Look! how those winged listeners all this while [...] Stand anxious: see! behold!"--This clamant word [...] Broke through the careful silence; for they heard [...] A rustling noise of leaves, and out there flutter'd [...] Pigeons and doves: Adonis something mutter'd, [...] The while one hand, that erst upon his thigh [...] Lay dormant, mov'd convuls'd and gradually [...] 500 [...] Up to his forehead. Then there was a hum [...] Of sudden voices, echoing, [...] "Come! come! [...] Arise! awake! Clear summer has forth walk'd [...] Unto the clover-sward, and she has talk'd [...] Full soothingly to every nested finch: [...] Rise, Cupids! or we'll give the blue-bell pinch [...] To your dimpled arms. Once more sweet life begin!" [...] At this, from every side they hurried in, [...] Rubbing their sleepy eyes with lazy wrists, [...] And doubling over head their little fists [...] 510 [...] In backward yawns. But all were soon alive: [...] For as delicious wine doth, sparkling, dive [...] In nectar'd clouds and curls through water fair, [...] So from the arbour roof down swell'd an air [...] Odorous and enlivening; making all [...] To laugh, and play, and sing, and loudly call [...] For their sweet queen: when lo! the wreathed green [...] Disparted, and far upward could be seen [...] Blue heaven, and a silver car, air-borne, [...] Whose silent wheels, fresh wet from clouds of morn, [...] Spun off a drizzling dew,--which falling chill [...] 521 [...] On soft Adonis' shoulders, made him still [...] Nestle and turn uneasily about. [...] Soon were the white doves plain, with necks stretch'd out, [...] And silken traces lighten'd in descent; [...] And soon, returning from love's banishment, [...] Queen Venus leaning downward open arm'd: [...] Her shadow fell upon his breast, and charm'd [...] A tumult to his heart, and a new life [...] Into his eyes. Ah, miserable strife, [...] 530 [...] But for her comforting! unhappy sight, [...] But meeting her blue orbs! Who, who can write [...] Of these first minutes?

60|$|That spindling sparseness, {{worse than}} utter baldness, of the wheat stubble now {{disappeared}} with cinematic suddenness, and our train was running past stretches of vineyard, where, among {{the green and}} purple and yellow ranks, the <b>vintagers,</b> with their donkeys and carts, were gathering the grapes in the paling light of the afternoon. Again the scene lacked the charm of woman's presence which the vintage had in southern France. In Spain we nowhere saw the women sharing the outdoor work of the men; and we fancied their absence {{the effect of the}} Oriental jealousy lingering from centuries of Moorish domination; though we could not entirely reconcile our theory with the publicity of their washing clothes at every stream.

The French revolutionists made stables of the cathedrals of France; you have made race-courses of the cathedrals of the earth. Your ONE {{conception}} of pleasure is to drive in railroad carriages round their aisles, and eat off their altars. {16} You have put a railroad-bridge over the falls of Schaffhausen. You have tunnelled the cliffs of Lucerne by Tell's chapel; you have destroyed the Clarens shore of the Lake of Geneva; {{there is not a}} quiet valley in England that you have not filled with bellowing fire; there is no particle left of English land which you have not trampled coal ashes into {17}--nor any foreign city in which the spread of your presence is not marked among its fair old streets and happy gardens by a consuming white leprosy of new hotels and perfumers' shops: the Alps themselves, which your own poets used to love so reverently, you look upon as soaped poles in a bear- garden, which you set yourselves to climb and slide down again, with [...] "shrieks of delight." [...] When you are past shrieking, having no human articulate voice to say you are glad with, you fill the quietude of their valleys with gunpowder blasts, and rush home, red with cutaneous eruption of conceit, and voluble with convulsive hiccough of self-satisfaction. I think nearly the two sorrowfullest spectacles I have ever seen in humanity, taking the deep inner significance of them, are the English mobs in the valley of Chamouni, amusing themselves with firing rusty howitzers; and the Swiss <b>vintagers</b> of Zurich expressing their Christian thanks for the gift of the vine, by assembling in knots in the [...] "towers of the vineyards," [...] and slowly loading and firing horse-pistols from morning till evening. It is pitiful, to have dim conceptions of duty; more pitiful, it seems to me, to have conceptions like these, of mirth.|$|R

So many of the grapes are harvested and manufactured in common that it is necessary the vintage should begin on a fixed day, and no one was allowed to anticipate or postpone. Some cut the grapes, and dropped them into the flattish wooden barrels, which others, after mashing the berries with a long wooden pestle, bore off and emptied frothing and gurgling into big casks mounted on carts. These were then driven into the village, where the mess was poured into the presses, and the wine crushed out to the last bitter dregs. The vineyards were a scene of activity, but not hilarity, though a little way off they looked rather lively with the <b>vintagers</b> at work in them. We climbed to one of them far up the mountain-side one day, where a family were gathering the grapes on a slope almost as steep as a house roof, father, mother, daughter, son-in-law, big boy, and big girl all silently busy together. There were bees and wasps humming around the tubs of crushed grapes in the pale afternoon sun; the view of the lake and the mountains was inspiring; but there was nothing bacchanalian in the affair, unless the thick calves of the girl, as she bent over to cut the clusters, suggested a Mænad fury. These poor people were quite songless, though I am bound to say that in another vineyard I did hear some of the children singing. It had momentarily stopped raining; but it soon began again, and the vintage went sorrowfully on in the mud. All Villeneuve smelt of the harsh juice and pulp arriving from the fields in the wagons, carts, tubs, and barrels which crowded the streets and sidewalks, and in divers cavernous basements the presses were at work, and there was a slop and drip of new wine everywhere. After dark the people came in from the fields and gossiped about their doors, and the red light of flitting lanterns blotched the steady rainpour. Outside of the village rose the black mountains, white at the top with their snows.|$|R
40|$|The "inhabited scroll" is a {{sinusoidal}} ornament of vegetal nature - {{either of}} vine or acanthus, or even, but rarely an ivy stem, filled with {{human and animal}} figures, e. g. <b>vintagers,</b> hares, partridges, and inanimate objects, e. g. baskets and vases. The motif, whose origins have been traced back to Hellenistic ornamental metalwork of the fourth-third century B. C., was popular in the Roman East. The present study confined to inhabited scrolls in architectural sculpture and on mosaic pavements from the fourth to the seventh century in Constantinople and in the eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire, examines the motif within its immediate architectural, geographical, economic, social and artistic context. It is based on 37 inhabited scrolls in architectural sculpture and 116 on mosaic pavements collected {{in the course of}} field-work in Turkey, Cyprus, the Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Israel, embodied in the catalogue of Vol. II and illustrated in Vols. Ill and IV. Owing {{to the nature of the}} material (destroyed, lost, damaged), and in view of its uneven publication, a systematic processing of it has been necessary. It includes the elaboration of a code of types of inhabited scrolls which condenses information and simplifies description. The geographical distribution of inhabited scrolls is examined and the evolution of the motif is traced from late Imperial times, a development illuminated by newly discovered second and third century inhabited scrolls in the Eastern Mediterranean. An attempt is also made to put forward reasons for changes in the distribution patterns from the Roman period when inhabited scrolls predominate in North Africa to the early Byzantine period, when they cluster in the Levant. The cluster in Syro-Cilicia and Palestine is accounted for principally by the booming economic situation of the area in the fifth-sixth century period. The code, moreover, provides a useful means of analysis from which inferences may be drawn particularly in the study of the predominance of some types of inhabited scroll patterns over others and the question of pattern books. Technical aspects of the study, e. g. the analysis of mosaic beds and tesserae stones, size of tesserae and number of tesserae to the dm 2, provide information which may be combined with code-type, measurements of pavements, diameter of scrolls, composition, stylistic elements and date to determine "regional groupings" of inhabited scrolls. It is argued that workshops proper can only be determined by a computed cluster analysis combining the various attributes of inhabited scroll pavements cited above. Finally the question of the symbolic significance of the motif is discussed. Like most other motifs from the Graeco-Roman artistic repertory, the inhabited scroll passed into Jewish and Christian art alike, taking a different meaning according to the period, the religion, the building and the onlooker...|$|R
6000|$|The {{return of}} the robin is {{commonly}} announced by the newspapers, like that of eminent or notorious people to a watering-place, as the first authentic notification of spring. And such his appearance in the orchard and garden undoubtedly is. But, {{in spite of his}} name of migratory thrush, he stays with us all winter, and I have seen him when the thermometer marked 15 degrees below zero of Fahrenheit, armed impregnably within,(1) like Emerson's Titmouse, and as cheerful as he. The robin has a bad reputation among people who do not value themselves less for being fond of cherries. There is, I admit, a spice of vulgarity in him, and his song is rather of the Bloomfield sort, too largely ballasted with prose. His ethics are of the Poor Richard school, and the main chance which calls forth all his energy is altogether of the belly. He never has these fine intervals of lunacy into which his cousins, the catbird and the mavis, are apt to fall. But for a' that and twice as muckle 's a' that, I would not exchange him for all the cherries that ever came out of Asia Minor. With whatever faults, he has not wholly forfeited that superiority which belongs to the children of nature. He has a finer taste in fruit than could be distilled from many successive committees of the Horticultural Society, and he eats with a relishing gulp not inferior to Dr. Johnson's. He feels and freely exercises his right of eminent domain. His is the earliest mess of green peas; his all the mulberries I had fancied mine. But if he get also the lion's share of the raspberries, he is a great planter, and sows those wild ones in the woods that solace the pedestrian, and give a momentary calm even to the jaded victims of the White Hills. He keeps a strict eye over one's fruit, and knows to a shade of purple when your grapes have cooked long enough in the sun. During the severe drought a few years ago the robins wholly vanished from my garden. I neither saw nor heard one for three weeks, meanwhile a small foreign grape-vine, rather shy of bearing, seemed to find the dusty air congenial, and, dreaming, perhaps of its sweet Argos across the sea, decked itself with a score or so of fair bunches. I watched them from day to day till they should have secreted sugar enough from the sunbeams, and at last made up my mind that I would celebrate my vintage the next morning. But the robins, too, had somehow kept note of them. They must have sent out spies, as did the Jews into the promised land, before I was stirring. When I went with my basket at least a dozen of these winged <b>vintagers</b> bustled out from among the leaves, and alighting on the nearest trees interchanged some shrill remarks about me of a derogatory nature. They had fairly sacked the vine. Not Wellington's veterans made cleaner work of a Spanish town; not Federals or Confederates were ever more impartial in the confiscation of neutral chickens. I was keeping my grapes a secret to surprise the fair Fidele with, but the robins made them a profounder secret to her than I had meant. The tattered remnant of a single bunch was all my harvest-home. How paltry it looked at the bottom of my basket,--as if a humming-bird had laid her egg in an eagle's nest! I could not help laughing; and the robins seemed to join heartily in the merriment. There was a native grape-vine close by, blue with its less refined abundance, but my cunning thieves preferred the foreign flavor. Could I tax them with want of taste? ...|$|R
