5|$|Subglacial mounds (SUGM) of the Mount Edziza {{volcanic}} complex are {{an unusual}} type of subglacial volcano formed when subglacial eruptions began melting overlying glacial ice {{at a time}} when this region was covered by glacial ice during the Pleistocene and early Holocene periods. These subglacial eruptions were not hot enough to melt a <b>vertical</b> <b>pipe</b> right through the overlying glacial ice, instead forming mounds of hydrated volcanic rock made up of volcanic fragments called hyaloclastite and lava that solidified into pillow-shaped masses called pillow lava deep beneath the glacial ice field. Once the glaciers had retreated, the subglacial volcanoes would be revealed, with a unique shape {{as a result of their}} confinement within glacial ice.|$|E

40|$|Feasibility {{study of}} a passive {{aeration}} reactor equipped with <b>vertical</b> <b>pipes</b> for compost stabilization of cow manure Pilot-scale composting was carried out with cow manure to evaluate the performances of two passive aeration systems: a conventional passive aeration system equipped with horizon-tal pipes and an unusual passive aeration method based on air delivery by means of <b>vertical</b> <b>pipes.</b> The effects of both types of passive aeration apparatus were investigated {{in order to determine}} the degree of composting rate by continuously monitoring temperature, moisture content, organic matter, electrical conductivity, pH and C/N ratio in the piles. Tem-peratures in the range of thermophily (55 – 65 °C) were reached in all runs within 1 – 2 days then lasting for about 1 week, a span long enough for pathogen abatement. Results suggest that passive aeration carried out by <b>vertical</b> <b>pipes</b> is more effective for air delivery into compost piles than con-ventional passive aeration of air adduction with horizontal pipes. The variation in the number of <b>vertical</b> <b>pipes</b> was revealed to be an important parameter for the control of com-posting rate and temperature. Composting rates estimated from the heat balance equation were substantially in agree-ment with those computed through the conversion ratio of total organic matter decrement. The conversion ratios and composting rates obtained in this study using passive aeration with <b>vertical</b> <b>pipes</b> were well aligned with those found using forced air delivery systems...|$|R

25|$|The Cassiar Mountains and Tanzilla Plateau in {{northern}} British Columbia {{are dominated by}} tuyas of the broad Tuya Volcanic Field. These flat-topped, steep-sided subglacial volcanoes were formed when magma intruded into and melted a <b>vertical</b> <b>pipe</b> in the overlying Cordilleran Ice Sheet. At least six volcanoes formed beneath glacial ice close to Tuya Lake, including Ash Mountain, South Tuya, Tuya Butte, Mathews Tuya. Ash Mountain {{at the head of}} Parallel Creek consists of pillow lava and hyaloclastite, South Tuya consists of loose volcanic debris with basaltic dikes intruding into the volcano and Tuya Butte and Mathews Tuya consist of pillow lava and hyaloclastite on its lower flanks with subaerially erupted lava flows at their flat-topped summits.|$|E
500|$|Based on {{radiocarbon}} and potassium-argon dating, {{volcanic activity}} in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field {{began in the early}} Pleistocene epoch, creating valley-filling and plateau-capping lava flows that have a total volume of approximately [...] The emplacement of these lava flows spanned at least three periods of glaciation, evidence for which is preserved in the form of tuyas, ice-ponded valley deposits, and subglacial mounds. The few tuyas in the region, such as Gage Hill, Hyalo Ridge, McLeod Hill and Mosquito Mound, were formed when magma intruded into and melted a <b>vertical</b> <b>pipe</b> in the overlying glacial ice. The partially molten mass cooled as a large block, with gravity flattening its upper surface. The glacial erosion of the tuyas suggests they erupted during the early Pleistocene epoch.|$|E
2500|$|As part of Operation Tinderbox, on June 24, 1980, a small {{satellite}} prototype (DSCS III) {{was subjected}} to radioactivity from the [...] "Huron King" [...] shot in a vertical line-of-sight (VLOS) test undertaken in Area 3. This was a program to improve the database on nuclear hardening design techniques for defense satellites. The VLOS test configuration involved placing a nuclear device (less than 20 kilotons) {{at the bottom of}} a shaft. A communications satellite or other experiment was placed in a partially evacuated test chamber simulating a space environment. The test chamber was parked at ground level at the top of the shaft. At zero time, the radiation from the device shot up the <b>vertical</b> <b>pipe</b> to the surface test chamber. Mechanical closures then intercepted and sealed the pipe, preventing the explosive shock wave from damaging the targets. The test chamber was immediately disconnected by remote control from the pipe and quickly winched to safety before the ground could subside to form a crater.
