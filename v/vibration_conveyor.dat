It is common for a transport package to be dropped, kicked, and impacted: These events may produce potentially damaging shocks. Transportation <b>vibration</b> from <b>conveyors,</b> trucks, railroads, or aircraft can also damage some items. Shock and vibration are controlled by cushioning so that the chance of product damage is greatly reduced.|$|R
40|$|Today {{much higher}} speed of {{operation}} and highly accurate weighing of packages during crossing a conveyor belt has been {{getting more and more}} important in the food and distribution industries etc. Continuous weighing means that masses of discrete packages on a conveyor belt are automatically determined in sequence. Making the best use of new weighing scale called a multi-stage conveyor belt scale which can be created so as to adjust the conveyor belt length to the product length, we propose a simplified and effective mass estimation algorithm under practical <b>vibration</b> modes. <b>Conveyor</b> belt scales usually have maximum capacities of less than 80 kg and 140 cm, and achieve measuring rates of 150 packages per minute and more. The output signals from the conveyor belt scales are always contaminated with noises due to <b>vibrations</b> of the <b>conveyor</b> belt and the product in motion. In this paper an employed digital filter is of Finite-duration Impulse Response (FIR) type designed under the consideration on the dynamics of conveyor belt scales. The experimental results on conveyor belt scales suggest that the filtering algorithm proposed here is effective enough to practical applications. 1...|$|R
40|$|Particulate solids flow on plane moving media, by {{translation}} (conveyor belts, chain carriers, slopes), or <b>vibration</b> (<b>conveyors)</b> {{is realized}} by mono or multi-layer feed. When {{it is necessary}} to realize high solid flows, or, on the contrary, {{it is not necessary to}} discriminate the solids at the end of the transporting, the particles are fed in bulk, in order to realize several particulate solids layers on the conveyor belt. The distribution of particles in the different layers, and the shapes assumed by the core is influenced by: i) the feeding condition, ii) the shape of each particle, iii) the surface characteristics of the particle, iv) the feed composition (mono or multi-phase), v) the size class distribution of the feed, vi) the characteristics of the transport carrier, vii) the transport length (time). As a consequence the shape of the heap changes, evolving from the feed to the carrier up to the discharge at the destination site. It has been observed as, maintaining constant the parameters previously described at point 1, 6 and 7 (feeding conditions and carrier characteristics) and for a specific transport time, the characteristics of the heap formed by the transported particles and, more specifically its profile, projected on a plane perpendicular to the transport direction, are influenced by the size class distribution and by physical and chemical attributes of the transported particles. With reference to the heap profile, as previously described, two main characteristics have been identified: a) profile structure, that is the monotonous curve overlaying the heap outline; b) profile texture, that is the structure of the variation of the heap outline depending by the position of the single particles at the border of the heap, this last characteristics has not to be confused with c) profile “distortions”, that is the noise affecting the signal representative of the heap outline...|$|R

These {{problems can be}} used as simple models to describe the vertical <b>vibrations</b> of a <b>conveyor</b> belt, for which the velocity is small with respect to the wave speed. In this paper the belt is assumed to move with a time-varying speed. Formal asymptotic approximations of the solutions are constructed to show the complicated dynamical behavior of the conveyor belt. It also will be shown that the truncation method can not be applied to this problem in order to obtain approximations valid on long time scales. ...|$|R

Screw conveyors have rotating helical shafts inside fixed a through or pipe. The goods are delivered with the rotation of screw. The rotational speed of screw shaft {{is directly related to}} the transmission capacity. It leads to serious balancing and <b>vibration</b> problems in <b>conveyor</b> because of the increasing rotational speed of screw shaft. The transmission capacity of materials depends on three factors. These are dimension and geometry of conveyor, characteristics of transmitted material.

40|$|AbstractQuality {{inspection}} is {{a standard}} process step in manufacturing processes {{and a lot of}} in situ measurement technology is available. Nevertheless, downscaling the dimension of the produced components to the micro domain requires new quality inspection and measurement technologies to acquire and analyze 2 D texture and 3 D shape information. In typical micro (bulk) production scenarios quality inspection is realized via microscopic imaging in an offline procedure where an expert analyzes a few samples of the produced micro components. This process is time consuming and 100 % quality inspection is not feasible. We present an automated demonstration platform to handle, sort and inspect metallic micro components. Bulk handling of micro components is realized by a robotic system in combination with a <b>vibration</b> helical <b>conveyor.</b> For quality inspection of micro components plenoptic cameras are used which are able to acquire 2 D and 3 D information in a single measurement step. Due to the compact design of plenoptic cameras an easy integration in the manufacturing process and an in situ measurement is possible. Based on fast image acquisition and image processing 100 % quality inspection of metallic micro components is possible which will also concern the complete process of quality control. A case study in a micro cold forming scenario will demonstrate the fundamental suitability of the proposed technique...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the weakly nonlinear, {{transversal}} <b>vibrations</b> of a <b>conveyor</b> belt will be considered. The belt {{is assumed to}} move with a low and time-varying speed. Using Kirchhoff's approach a single equation of motion will be derived from a coupled system of partial differential equations describing the longitudinal and transversal vibrations of the belt. A two time-scales perturbation method is then applied to approximate the solutions of the problem. It will turn out that the frequencies of the belt speed fluctuations {{play an important role}} in the dynamic behaviour of the belt. It is well-known in linear systems that instabilities can occur if the frequency of the belt speed uctuations is the sum of two natural frequencies. However, in the weakly nonlinear case as considered in this paper this is no longer true. It turns out that the weak nonlinearity stabilizes the system.

40|$|Abstract − Large {{quantities}} of commodities in different sizes transported on belt conveyors should often be mea-sured automatically {{by two or}} three conveyor belt scales. Continuous measurement can be dynamically performed by multi-stage conveyor belt scales, so that the masses of discrete objects on belt conveyors can be determined in sequence according to the different lengths. Belt conveyor scales usually have maximum capacities of less than 80 kg and 130 cm, and achieve measuring rates of 150 packages per minutes and more. The output signals from the multi-stage conveyor belt scales are always contaminated with noises due to <b>vibrations</b> of the <b>conveyor</b> and the object to be measured in motion. This measuring system consists of the three-stage conveyor belt scales with load-cells, and the photo-electro switches which detect the measuring lengths of the objects and distance between each object in sequence. The experimental results on the multi-stage conveyor belt scales suggest that the algorithms proposed in this paper are effective enough to practical applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:With the {{improvement}} of the load and speed of belt conveyor, the dynamic characteristic problem of belt conveyer appears especially outstanding. This paper analyzed the force situation of the conveyer by the discrete dynamics model, divided n viscoelastic properties mass units in advance, then built system analysis dynamics model by vibration mechanics, built modal neutral file of the flexible belt block by means of finite element analysis software, and built the virtual prototype model of the belt conveyor using ADMAS program. It analyzed the effect of stiffness and damping of belt on the starting process by dynamic characteristics simulation method. The simulation results showed that the speed wave period of belt with the smaller stiffness was longer and the peak was bigger, the belt speed easily occurred stronger surge, the transverse <b>vibration</b> of belt <b>conveyor</b> became more violent. With the increasing of stiffness, the belt speed wave peak value decreased. As the same time, the speed surge also decreased when other operation parameters of the belt conveyer system are fixed, with increasing of the damping, the dynamic tension force peak became smaller gradually, it led to decrease of vibration curve peak. Damping coefficient played the important role in decreasing the vibration intensity, the research result offers a new basis for the analysis and study of the dynamic characteristics of belt conveyor...|$|R
40|$|In axially moving {{structures}} like {{conveyor belt}} systems, magnetic tapes, and so on, vibrations occur {{due to the}} presence of different kinds of imperfections in the systems. For these structures internal resonances can lead to severe <b>vibrations.</b> Resonance free <b>conveyor</b> belt systems can be constructed if the frequencies of the system are known. In this thesis two models for an axially moving continuum have been studied: a string-like model (mathematically modelled by a wave equation) and a beam-string-like model (mathematically modelled by the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation with an additional tension term). The corresponding initial-boundary value problems have been solved approximately or exactly by using the multiple timescales perturbation method or the Laplace transform method. Exact solutions and formal approximations of the solutions for some string-like problems have been found in the form of Fourier series. It has been shown that the truncation method for the string-like problem can not be applied in order to obtain an accurate solution or approximation on a long time-scale. A new model approach describing the transient ``from string to beam'' behaviour, based on the calculations of the natural frequencies of the system has been proposed. The influence of the bending stiffness on the stability properties of the solution of the problem has been studied. An important implication of the results as presented in this thesis is that for these types of axially moving continua problems the use of only string-like models is not appropriate. To describe the dynamics of these types of problems correctly one has to include (small) bending stiffness in the model. It has also been shown that the introduction of a damping term does not solve the truncation problem for the string-like equation, at least if the damping is assumed to be small. A possible energy transfer between transversal and longitudinal vibration-directions has been studied in case of a sudden stoppage of the conveyor belt system. It has been shown that this energy transfer can occur depending on the existing internal resonances in the system which are determined by the belt system parameters.
