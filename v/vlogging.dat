30|$|<b>Vlog</b> shares video {{contents}} through online, and {{is characterized}} by the emphasis on the interaction between the information provider and the recipient. Although the <b>vlog</b> varies slightly different depending on the <b>vlog,</b> the vlogger appears in the video in a tone that sounds like a telling a story to the friends or acquaintance, and each other communicate and interact with comment or direct message (DM). Therefore, it can be presumed that the emotional bond formed through the interaction between vloggers and <b>vlog</b> viewers will have an important influence on the effect of vlogger’s attributes on the content sharing intention and on the attitude towards product on the <b>vlog.</b>|$|R
30|$|Our research, however, has the {{following}} limitations. First, {{the scope of}} our research was confined to the fashion products that are exposed in <b>vlogs.</b> But in reality, various lines of products other than fashion can be dealt in <b>vlogs,</b> and the response of audience can {{vary depending on the}} nature of products. Second, we used non-celebrity vloggers’ videos as stimuli, and the research focused on non-celebrity vloggers. Recently, however, an increased number of celebrities began to utilize <b>vlog</b> to communicate with their fans as YouTube-based <b>vlogs</b> gain popularity. Retailers acknowledged commercial value of <b>vlogs</b> as well, and are carrying out collaboration projects with non-celebrity vloggers or opening their own channels.|$|R

A <b>vlog</b> is a video blog in which the content are mostly posted in video form. According to the Harnish and Brideges’ study (2016), the <b>vlogs,</b> which are “computer mediated,” can be described as informal communications directed at other consumers about the ownership, usage, or characteristics of particular goods and services. As a result, <b>vlog</b> encompasses product-related discussions and content, product evaluation, and direct recommendation (Berger and Iyengar 2013). Another previous study defines that a <b>vlog</b> is a video content in which the vlogger’s daily life is divided into several scenes (Harnish and Bridges 2016).|$|R
30|$|<b>Vlog</b> (video blog) {{is a type}} {{of online}} video documentations of people {{recording}} themselves buying and using fashion and beauty products. Recently, general people posting <b>vlog</b> on newly shopped fashion and cosmetics items are gaining popularity, and it is growing more common to get consumer reviews or opinion through these kinds of <b>vlogs.</b> As a result, the existing social media outlets and information-providing websites began provide various additional services related to video content. In addition, retailers are realizing the popularity of <b>vlog,</b> and many retailers and product manufacturers recognize <b>vlog</b> as part of their marketing mix and are actively using it in marketing such as offering their products to vloggers (Harnish and Bridges 2016).|$|R
30|$|First, {{although}} <b>vlog</b> {{is rapidly}} spreads through online video sharing websites and has different features from existing video content such as movies, CF, and home shopping advertisements, {{there is not}} sufficient research on <b>vlog</b> being carried out.

30|$|<b>Vlog</b> is a {{new type}} of video content and it has {{something}} in common with existing video content, such as movies and TV programs in that various products including fashion items are exposed to viewers through contents. According to a previous research on the traditional form of media-video contents, {{there are two types of}} product exposure type: implicit exposure and explicit exposure (Oh 2014). Implicit product exposure type refers to the form in which the product is exposed to the part of background of a scene in the video, while explicit product exposure type refers to the form that specific product directly exposed in the video by a direction mentions (Oh 2014). These product exposure types are also applicable to the <b>vlog.</b> The implicit exposure type is that products are showed through vlogger’s daily life, while the explicitly exposure type is that the vlogger directly mentions the products in the <b>vlog</b> (Lee and Watkins 2016). Based on the previous studies about <b>vlog,</b> this study classified the types of products exposed in <b>vlog</b> into two categories as follows. First type is a <b>vlog</b> that shows vlogger’s usual daily lives and implicitly expose their products; another type is a <b>vlog</b> that explicitly exposes the product, providing detailed information about it. In this regard, this study categorizes the types of products exposed in <b>vlog</b> as implicit/explicit, and expects that the viewer will perceive the attributes of the information source differently depending on how the vlogger exposes the product on <b>vlogs.</b>|$|R

Also we confirmed that the video selected for the survey was properly manipulated in advance (Appendix 1). Based on theoretical consideration in “The concept of <b>VLOG</b> (Video Blog) and difference in product exposure type on VLOG” section, we selected the two type of <b>vlogs</b> for survey-showing the vlogger’s daily lifestyle video as implicit type, and product-review video as explicit type of <b>vlog.</b> We developed a questionnaire for the survey delivered to of women in age 18 – 39, who have experiences of watched <b>vlogs.</b> The {{participants were asked to}} answer a questionnaire after watching either a <b>vlog</b> with an explicit product exposure or an implicit product exposure.|$|R
