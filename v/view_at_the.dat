5|$|The land {{immediately}} {{south and}} west of the town {{is part of the}} Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is traversed by the South Dorset Ridgeway, part of the South West Coast Path. There are over five hundred ancient monuments along the chalk hills that form the ridgeway, including barrows, stone circles and hillforts; many archaeological finds from the area are on <b>view</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Dorset County Museum in Dorchester.|$|E
5|$|When Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941, {{it came to}} be seen as {{unlikely}} that there would be any attempted landing as long as that conflict was undecided — from the British point of <b>view</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, the matter hung in the balance. In July 1941, construction of field fortifications was greatly reduced and concentration given to the possibility of a raid in force rather than a full-scale invasion.|$|E
5|$|Countershading is {{less often}} used for {{military}} camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that showed its effectiveness. English zoologist Hugh Cott encouraged the use of techniques including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities. Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting {{as a kind of}} invisibility cloak, and they had to be taught to look at camouflage practically, from the enemy observer's point of <b>view.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time in Australia, zoologist William John Dakin advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.|$|E

5|$|This {{machine was}} on exhibit in the 1960s at Bellm's Cars of Yesterday in Sarasota, Florida. An 1894 Roper {{velocipede}} was lent from the R. J. Boudeman family collection to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum's 2001 expansion, Guggenheim Las Vegas, where The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition {{was the only}} show there until the expansion closed in 2003. It was the fourth venue for the motorcycle design show which had first opened at the Guggenheim New York in 1998, where the Michaux-Perreaux velocipede {{had been the first}} machine viewers saw upon entering the rotunda of the museum. Later, the Boudeman Roper velocipede was on <b>view</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2011 Deeley Motorcycle Exhibition in Vancouver. An 1894 Roper was offered for auction in January 2012, with a claimed high bid of $425,000.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe, {{whose parents}} were both half Caucasian, was raised as an American Indian. His accomplishments {{occurred}} {{during a period of}} severe racial inequality in the United States. It has often been suggested that his medals were stripped because of his ethnicity.* Elfers. pg. 18 While it is difficult to prove this, the public comment at the time largely reflected this <b>view.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time Thorpe won his gold medals, not all Native Americans were recognized as U.S.citizens. (The U.S.government had wanted them to make concessions to adopt European-American ways to receive such recognition.) Citizenship was not granted to all American Indians until 1924.|$|E
5|$|Filming the pre-title {{sequence}} {{went through}} some alterations. One {{of the scenes}} saw Johnny being foot whipped, however the shot where the stick struck the soles of the feet was cut out due to its brutality. Also, when discussing how Johnny would be expelled from the mosque afterwards, Nalluri suggested using the idea where he is thrown {{to the top of}} the surveillance van, which would give the audience the impression that the antagonists were on to them. Later on in the episode, Nalluri wanted to include some exposition shots, which shows Khaldun's actions while he narrates them to MI5. In one scene, Tom observes Khaldun inside a prison cell by opening a slide <b>view</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> prison door. However one had to be made because no such doors exist in the United Kingdom. Following the broadcast of the episode, the producers were surprised to hear that the BBC were unhappy with a scene showing Harry holding a Costa Coffee cup, as the corporation believed it was done out of product placement. They were also surprised to learn that they did not take notice in a scene with Malcolm Wynn-Jones delightfully eating a piece of chocolate from a Black Magic chocolate box, which they thought was a more obvious example. Portraying actor Hugh Simon had to spit out the chocolate after the take as he disliked the confectionery.|$|E

5|$|From 1978, Ecclestone was {{president}} of the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA), a body formed by the teams to represent their interests. This left his team open to accusations of having advance warning of rule changes. Ecclestone denies that the team benefited from this and Murray has noted that, contrary to this <b>view,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of 1982 the team had to abandon their new BT51 car, built on the basis that ground effect would be permitted in 1983. Brabham had to design and build a replacement, the BT52, in only three months. At the end of the 1983 season, Renault and Ferrari, both beaten to the Drivers' Championship by Piquet, protested that the Research Octane Number (RON) of the team's fuel was above the legal limit of 102. The FIA declared that a figure of up to 102.9 was permitted under the rules, and that Brabham had not exceeded this limit.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Littleton (June 14, 1922 – December 13, 2013) was an American {{glass artist}} and educator. Born in Corning, New York, {{he grew up}} in the shadow of Corning Glass Works, where his father headed Research and Development during the 1930s. Expected by his father to enter the field of physics, Littleton instead chose a career in art, gaining {{recognition}} first as a ceramist and later as a glassblower and sculptor in glass. In the latter capacity he was very influential, organizing the first glassblowing seminar aimed at the studio artist in 1962, {{on the grounds of the}} Toledo Museum of Art. Imbued with the prevailing <b>view</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time that glassblowing could only be done on the factory floor, separated from the designer at his desk, Littleton aimed to put it within the reach of the individual studio artist.|$|E
5|$|The privateers {{arrived at}} Old Panama City on 27 January 1671; they camped {{overnight}} before attacking the following day. They were opposed by approximately 1,200 Spanish infantry and 400 cavalry; most were inexperienced. Morgan sent a 300-strong party of men down a ravine {{that led to}} the foot of a small hill on the Spanish right flank. As they disappeared from view, the Spanish front line thought the privateers were retreating, and the left wing broke rank and chased, followed by the remainder of the defending infantry. They were met with well-organised firing from Morgan's main force of troops. When the party came into <b>view</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the ravine, they were charged by the Spanish cavalry, but organised fire destroyed the cavalry and the party attacked the flank of the main Spanish force. In an effort to disorganise Morgan's forces, the governor of Panama released two herds of oxen and bulls onto the battlefield; scared by the noise of the gunfire, they turned and stampeded over their keepers and some of the remaining Spanish troops. The battle was a rout: the Spanish lost between 400 and 500 men, against 15 privateers killed.|$|E

25|$|This {{church was}} {{replaced}} with a Romanesque church with a nave and two aisles.

Weyr consecrated to the founding of the church by Charlemagne. In any case, a church of Saint Peter in Vienna is first mentioned in 1137.

25|$|Tokarev's {{view that}} {{religions}} {{are more than}} a theology, and comprise a social force affecting many aspects of people's lives, was controversial among Soviet scholars of religion.

He showed that Islam could be used effectively by politicians with secular goals, and that Islamic socialism could be a positive force in the development of contemporary Muslim states.|$|E
