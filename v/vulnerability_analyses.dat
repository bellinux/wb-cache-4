40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly common for local-government officials (civil servants and political appointees) {{to take part in}} <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses</b> to assess their municipality’s capacity to withstand various crises. The question of how such groups conceive of problems concerning their municipality’s crisis management capabilities is largely unexplored. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the conceptions that groups of civil servants and political appointees engaged in <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses</b> have of weaknesses in their organizations’ crisis management capabilities. The attempt is to identify themes in how problems are described, as well as to compare how often the problems may be associated with different elements that constitute an organization and the different crisis management processes an organization needs to be involved in to manage crises.

40|$|Today risk {{analyses}} {{are commonly used}} by authorities at national, regional and municipal levels in their work to prevent and prepare for crises. The analyses provide information about types of incidents that can occur and the potential consequences of these events. In Sweden and Norway it is mandatory for local authorities to conduct risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses</b> and use them as an input in their crisis management work. Research on public risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses</b> often focuses on methodological issues and only to a limited extent on how findings are used by those who undertook or ordered the analysis. For the analyses to become inputs in work to improve societal safety and respond to crises {{it is important that}} findings are of sufficient quality and that they are applied or implemented. This paper focuses on strategies used by Norwegian and Swedish municipalities to integrate risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses</b> in their current policy and planning processes. Examination of five Norwegian and four Swedish municipalities showed that municipalities vary in their focus on integration of risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses</b> in long term planning processes, in their daily activities as well as in crisis management planning. They chose three main strategies to ensure integration of the analyses; some relied on formalized and highly structured procedures, whereas others emphasized that each leader and planner was responsible for taking risk and vulnerability analysis into consideration where necessary...|$|E

40|$|Risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses</b> are a {{required}} decision support tool in processes to improve societal safety and crisis preparedness at national, {{regional and local}} levels in several European states. Analyses result in risk images, which are the stakeholders’ views of events {{that must be addressed}} in planning processes related to topics such as land use and crisis management. Hence, risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses</b> are used to support decisions regarding which issue areas to prioritize, as well as to choose between alternatives. In Norway and Sweden, municipal risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses</b> are mandated and described in regulations, laws and guidelines. This article examines how the two countries’ regulation regimes address, characterize and facilitate risk-based decision-making. We found that the Swedish regulation regime emphasizes use of risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses</b> in decision-making regarding emergency preparedness. In Norway, this is also an important issue, but decision-making with regard to long-term and strategic planning is also emphasized. In both regulation regimes, decision-makers must determine on their own how they should use the analyses as a foundation for decision-making regarding emergency preparedness and societal safety. While the regulation regimes contain method and content prescriptions, they do not specify how criteria regarding desirable levels of preparedness and societal safety should be determined, nor who should be involved in such processes. These are challenges that should be addressed in regulation guidelines and in audits carried out by regional authorities...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrical}} grid {{needs to be}} changed in the future in order to manage more distributed and renewable generation and also {{to make it possible for}} electricity consumers to be more active and aware of their electricity consumption. This future grid is usually referred to as a smart grid. With the transition to a smart grid, new challenges occur. One method to determine those challenges is to perform risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses.</b> InStockholm, the new urban district Stockholm Royal Seaport is built. The district has a strong environmental profile and the electricity grid in the area is formed into a smart grid. Responsible for constructing the smart grid is Fortum. The purpose of this master thesis has been to develop a method for risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses</b> for smart grids. To achieve the purpose, the following questions have been answered: What are the risks and challenges in a smart grid? What do current methods for risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses</b> for electricity networks look like? How can a method be developed for risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses</b> for smart grids? What are the risks in the smart grid in Stockholm Royal Seaport? Focus in the thesis has been on distribution level and risks that lead to power outages. Some of the smart grid technologies, such as energy storage, will not be included in the early stages in the development of the smart grid in Stockholm Royal Seaport, and are not addressed in this thesis. The risks that have been identified for smart grids are mainly about challenges in communication and how information is handled, maintenance, and the transition of the grid structure. Electricity companies perform risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses</b> for their electrical networks regarding delivery security. This means that the risks examined are such that if they do occur they can lead to power outages that lasts more than 24 hours, or shorter depending on power load. The risks are divided into five different categories and the consequences of the risks are determined after how long time it takes to fix them when they have led to a power outage. To obtain a functioning method for risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses</b> for smart grids an additional category has been added. This category is called information security and includes risks related to information and communication technology. The method has been tested on the intended grid in Stockholm Royal Seaport. The most important risks that have been identified in the smart grid are integration of new components and systems, cooperation between participants, lack of information management and interruption in communication network...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explain the}} {{association}} between children's self-perceived oral health status and dental anxiety, by considering their levels of cognitive vulnerability. METHODS: Participants were 161 children (47. 8 % female; mean age = 11. 93 years) who filled in a questionnaire comprising self-assessed oral health-related status, dental treatment-related cognitive vulnerability and dental anxiety measures. Gender, age and number of decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth were controlled for. Bivariate correlations, hierarchical regression analyses and structural equation modelling were conducted to test the hypotheses. RESULTS: Subjective oral health status, cognitive vulnerability variables and dental anxiety were strongly correlated. Regression and structural models testing the mediating effects of cognitive vulnerability variables {{on the relationship between}} perceived oral health and dental anxiety were supported. CONCLUSIONS: The activation of the cognitive vulnerability schema, as a mediating variable, is a mechanism by means of which children's self-perceptions of a poor oral health might lead to dental anxiety.

METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was sent to elderly care staff in 4 Swedish municipalities. The questions involved experiences of extraordinary events, education and exercises, and risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses,</b> evaluations of main risks and emergency preparedness, and familiarity with preparedness plans. In total, 568 elderly care staff responded. RESULTS: Between 15 % and 25 % of the respondents claimed experiences of extraordinary events, exercises and education, and risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses.</b> The same number claimed familiarity with the organization's preparedness plan, whereas ~ 85 % answered that they need more education and exercises. Emergency preparedness was evaluated as important.

As input to the framework, characteristics of interdependencies and {{the objectives of the}} modelling framework are discussed. The overall approach is to divide the modelling of technical infrastructures into two parts, a topological part and a functional part. The topological part describes the structure and how components are connected. The functional part describes the flow of the infrastructure and how the system reacts when strains affect it. This generic approach of how to model individual infrastructures then enables the inclusion of dependencies in and analyses of a “system-of-system” model. Three perspectives of <b>vulnerability</b> <b>analyses</b> are also presented: global vulnerability, critical components and geographical vulnerability.

This study presents and applies a method to explicitly account for exposure in identifying and evaluating link criticality in public transport networks. The proposed method is compared with conventional measures that lack exposure information.

The methodology was applied for a multi-modal public transport network in the Netherlands where data concerning disruptions was available. The results expose the role of exposure in determining link criticality and overall network vulnerability. The inclusion of exposure in the assessment of societal costs has thus consequences on assessing mitigation measures and investment priorities.
