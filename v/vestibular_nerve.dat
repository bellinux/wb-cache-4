2500|$|The <b>vestibular</b> <b>nerve</b> conducts {{information}} from sensory receptors in three ampulla that sense motion of fluid in three semicircular canals caused by three-dimensional {{rotation of the}} head. [...] The <b>vestibular</b> <b>nerve</b> also conducts {{information from}} the utricle and the saccule, which contain hair-like sensory receptors that bend {{under the weight of}} otoliths (which are small crystals of calcium carbonate) that provide the inertia needed to detect head rotation, linear acceleration, and the direction of gravitational force.|$|E
40|$|Anterior-posterior {{body sway}} was evoked with {{monopolar}} bi-aural galvanic stimulus of the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nerves</b> in normal subjects and recorded {{with a force}} platform, two experiments being conducted. In an experiment of paired design, 9 normal subjects showed an increase in anterior-posterior sway as compared with lateral sway when exposed to the stimulus. In a second experiment another group of 10 normal subjects were exposed to a galvanic stimulus between a neck electrode and two electrodes placed on the arms, {{but there was no}} change in the relationship between anterior-posterior and lateral body sway. It is concluded that monopolar galvanic stimulus of the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nerves</b> can induce anterior-posterior body sway, a phenomenon which can be utilised to investigate the vestibulo-spinal contribution in postural control in the anterior-posterior plane...|$|R

2500|$|Other {{suggested}} {{causes of}} vestibular migraines include the following: unilateral neuronal instability of the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nerve,</b> [...] idiopathic asymmetric {{activation of the}} vestibular nuclei in the brainstem, and vasospasm of the blood vessels supplying the labyrinth or central vestibular pathways resulting in ischemia to these structures.

Additionally, vestibular migraines tend to occur more often in women and rarely affect individuals after the sixth decade of life.|$|E
2500|$|Vertigo that {{is caused}} by {{problems}} with the inner ear or vestibular system, which is composed of the semicircular canals, the vestibule (utricle and saccule), and the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nerve</b> is called [...] "peripheral", [...] "otologic" [...] or [...] "vestibular" [...] vertigo. The most common cause is {{benign paroxysmal positional vertigo}} (BPPV), which accounts for 32% of all peripheral vertigo. Other causes include Ménière's disease (12%), superior canal dehiscence syndrome, labyrinthitis, and visual vertigo. [...] Any cause of inflammation such as common cold, influenza, and bacterial infections may cause transient vertigo if it involves the inner ear, as may chemical insults (e.g., aminoglycosides) or physical trauma (e.g., skull fractures). [...] Motion sickness is sometimes classified as a cause of peripheral vertigo.|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of the fastigial nucleus and the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nerves</b> (eighth cranial nerves) to the orthostatic reflexes in anesthetized, paralyzed cats was studied. Bilateral lesions of the rostral fastigial nucleus resulted in impairment of the reflex changes in blood pressure, femoral arterial flow, and resistance evoked by head-up tilting to 30 ° or 60 °. The deficit consisted {{of an increase in}} the magnitude of the initial fall in blood pressure during tilting. The effects on blood pressure were paralleled by decreased vasoconstriction in the femoral artery. Extracranial lesions of the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nerves</b> pro-duced comparable deficits which were not enhanced by subsequent lesions of the fastigial nucleus. Denervation of the baroreceptors impaired the reflexes, and subsequent lesion of the fastigial nucleus increased this deficit. The pressor response evoked by electrical stimulation of the rostral fastigial nucleus also reversed the deficit in orthostasis produced by hemorrhage. Small doses of sodium pentobarbital which did not alter the resting blood pressure or the pressor response to carotid occlusion impaired the responses to stimula-tion of the fastigial nucleus and tilting. Therefore, the rostral fastigial nucleus, whic...|$|R
30|$|Purely intralabyrintine schwannomas are rare.

The increase in body sway in the lateral plane induced by the galvanic stimulus was enhanced when the feet were anaesthetized, and adaptation of postural control to the galvanic stimulus was delayed.

40|$|Bilateral vestibulopathy is a {{heterogeneous}} chronic condition {{characterized by a}} bilateral reduced or absent function of the vestibular organs, the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nerves</b> {{or a combination of}} both.

When vestibular function is lost, essential tasks such as postural control, gaze stabilization, and balance deteriorate and the quality of life of patients is significantly impaired. Nowadays the widely available treatment of bilateral vestibulopathy is vestibular rehabilitation. The aim of the vestibular rehabiltation is to use adaptive mechanisms of brain and to activate compensation mechanisms. In this review, applications of vestibular rehabilitation, different exercise programs and techniques are presented by reviewing recent literature results...|$|R
