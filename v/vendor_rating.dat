40|$|Rural California WIC {{participants}} tend to show {{a slightly}} lower propensity to redeem WIC-issued food instruments than urban California WIC participants do. In addition to possible food availability problems associated with rural locations, {{the presence or absence}} of cultural factors, especially foreign language backgrounds, may also help to explain this difference. Limited English-speaking WIC participants seem somewhat more likely to redeem their food vouchers than primarily English-speaking WIC participants do. This condition seems to be as prevalent in rural California areas as it is for the urban-dominated California WIC population as a whole. Nevertheless, WIC food instrument redemption rate analysis, together with geographic information systems, might be helpful in pinpointing areas around the country where physical food availability problems might exist. Background Food insecurity has been defined as lack of "assured access at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life " (Andrews, 1999). Food inse-curity may be exacerbated in rural areas vis-a-vis urban areas because of transportation issues and less well-stocked grocery stores with more expen-sive items (Kaufian, 1997). To help study possible regional variation in food accessibility, food instrument (voucher) redemption records are available from the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Supplemental Nutrition Program, whose purpose it is to provide food supplements and nutritional education for low-income women and their small children (Food Research and Action Cen-ter). Qualified individuals can redeem WIC-issued instuments for specified food items from authorized grocers or <b>vendors.</b> <b>Rates</b> of redemption can vary. Previous research has shown a significant difference in California WIC food instrument redemption rates between members of various ethnic and linguistic groups. Notably, limited English-speaking house-holds were generally found to have higher food in-strument redemption rates than primarily English-speaking households (Matthews, 2000). See Figures la and lb.

We find that although subjects are responsive to the item price and <b>vendor</b> <b>rating,</b> and subjects are more likely to trust vendors when given reputation information from institutional sources, they do not differentiate capability from reliability information in evaluating vendors in this context...|$|E
40|$|Since Kraljic's (1983) seminal work, {{purchasing}} {{departments in}} the most successful organisations adopted portfolio approaches to supplier management. However these models fail to consider final market demand and price volatility, thus leading buyers to establish with suppliers long-term relationships also when the investments are not properly rewarded. Moreover, portfolio approaches provides high level guidelines seldom integrated with operative tools such as <b>vendor</b> <b>rating</b> systems. This paper presents a new portfolio model that, taking into account final market features, indicates both the level of right buyer-supplier integration and the evaluation parameters to assess when choosing the supplier for that relationship. Expert interviews and a case study have been performed to test the proposed model. The results indicate that, for high supply market risk, strategic product must be purchased with different strategies depending on {{the difficulty of the}} downstream market.

40|$|Fuzzy {{methodology}} {{appears to}} be one of the most promising tools for managing the ambiguity and indetermination that characterize the evaluation of suppliers' contribution to product development. This kind of evaluation, in fact, is particularly complex, given the difficulty in identifying, circumscribing and quantifying the supplier's co-design performance. Moreover, this evaluation is mainly perceptive and strongly influenced by subjective judgements, being linked to the experience and common sense of decision-makers (purchasers, designers, etc). In this paper we present a fuzzy expert system prototype able to manage the evaluation process and to offer a reliable measurement of the contribution of the suppliers in new product development (NPD). The objectives of this study are the following: (a) to develop a <b>vendor</b> <b>rating</b> tool based on fuzzy logic; (b) to refine it using a neural application; and (c) to compare it with an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, which reproduces the traditional method of evaluation.

A classification of relevant integration techniques (i. e. decisions on how to manage interface processes) and tools (i. e. assets or resources that support the adoption of techniques) is provided: techniques are grouped into the operations, technological and strategic domains, while tools are divided into the information technology, management and organization classes. An in-field research in the Italian industry of components for household appliances provided the ground to measure the diffusion of techniques and tools in the relationships between component manufacturers and appliance OEMs. The study found that the most adopted are the techniques related to operations management, coherently with the industry priorities, while the diffusion of technological and strategic techniques is low. Tools, on the other hand, have generally a low diffusion rate, except for <b>vendor</b> <b>rating</b> systems and e-procurement. Analyzing firms’ efficiency and effectiveness performances, it is possible to notice how the best performing firms are the ones adopting the higher number of techniques and tools in all domains, while efficiency-oriented companies focus their integration practices (that are actually light) in the logistic domain, and growth-oriented companies give great importance to coordination in new product development and strategic planning...|$|E

Design and setting: Global Drug Survey: purposive sample collected in late 2012. Participants: The base sample (n= 9470) reported recent drug purchase and resided in the United Kingdom (n= 4315, median age 24, 76 % male), Australia (n= 2761, median age 32, 76 % male) or the United States (n= 2394, median age 21, 80 % male). Measurements: Online questionnaire. Findings: A total of 65 % of US, 53 % of Australian and 40 % of UK respondents had heard of SR; 18 % of US, 10 % of UK and 7 % of Australian respondents had consumed drugs purchased through SR. Across the three countries, 3, 4 -methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) was the most commonly purchased drug (53 - 60 %), followed by cannabis (34 - 51 %), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (29 - 45 %) and the 2 C family (16 %- 27 %). The most common reasons for purchasing from SR were wider range (75 - 89 %), better quality (72 - 77 %), greater convenience (67 - 69 %) {{and the use of}} <b>vendor</b> <b>rating</b> systems (60 - 65 %). The most common reasons for avoiding SR purchase were adequate drug access (63 - 68 %) and fear of being caught (41 - 53 %).

40|$|Abstract—Smart grid {{solutions}} for the energy distribution industry are receiving significant attention globally {{as a means for}} improving the efficiency and reliability of the electrical power grid. These solutions infuse intelligent monitoring and control devices throughout the distribution network to report on electrical properties such as voltage, current and power, as well as raising network alarms and events. A further aspect of the smart grid embodies the dynamic rating of electrical assets of the network. This fundamentally involves a rating of the load current capacity of electrical assets including cables, transformers and switches. The mainstream approach to rate assets is to apply the <b>vendor</b> plate <b>rating,</b> which often under utilizes assets, or in some cases over utilizes when environmental conditions reduce the effective rated capacity, potentially reducing lifetime. Using active intelligence we have developed a rating system that rates assets in real time based upon several events. This allows for a far more efficient and reliable electrical grid that is able to extend further the life and reliability of the electrical network. In this paper we describe our systems architecture, the observations made during development of the solution, and illustrate how this solution blends with the smart grid by proposing a dynamic rating system for the smart grid.
