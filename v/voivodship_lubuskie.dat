Therefore the issue of policy and the problems connected with a regional development started to be discussed along with the development of the economic integration and the enlargement of Communities with another countries, which were much different economically from the founders. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) was established at the Copenhagen summit in 1975 and the resources were distributed into member states. The subsequent enlargement of the Community in 1986 with Spain and Portugal contributed to signing the Single European Act (SEA), which created the basis for a new structural policy and its reform in 1988, and the binding rules were additionally enlarged in the European Union Treaty from Maastricht.

Nowadays, a challenge for business is to create appropriate instruments of influence directed towards this market segment. The needs of this segment must be identified to adjust offers making sure they contain innovative solutions. The {{aim of this study}} is to discuss challenges a business faces in the development of the {{segment of the}} seniors. Methodology: The research emerged from the deeper studies into the national and foreign literature. Frequency analysis allowed to reinforce theoretical deliberations and assess available research in the field of innovations for the seniors. Identification of the attitudes and expectations of the seniors towards innovation required a survey. It was conducted in a group of 345 respondents over the age of 55, using the questionnaire developed by the authors. <b>Lubuskie</b> <b>Voivodship</b> was chosen for the research. The main goal of field research was to study attitudes and behaviours of the seniors towards innovations. Before the commencement of the research, a pilot research was carried out, which enabled the verification of the measurement tool and eliminated potential irregularities.

The advantage of this method is its ease of implementation for both the homogeneous mean-field order parameter and the heterogeneous one. To be specific, the mean-field version of the Ising model spin system is discussed in detail and the resulting magnetization is the same {{as in the case of}} solving the respective mean-field self-consistency equation. In addition, it is shown that if a high temperature phase of such system is quenched below critical temperature then the mean field experienced by spins develops into a network of domains in analogous way as it happens with the spins in the case of the exact many-body Hamiltonian system and the coarsening processes start to take place.

40|$|Over 50 {{years ago}} Edward Dąbrowski ended few seasons {{excavations}} of the stronghold in Połupin. From {{that time it}} is one of these early medieval sites located in nowadays <b>Lubuskie</b> <b>voivodship,</b> around which quite large literature has grown (see below), {{and at the same time}} much controversy connected especially with stronghold chronology and origin of the famous, bronze, small plate. Verification of Edward Dąbrowski’s conclusions was seriously impeded by the lack of full study and publishing of the sources discovered there. The filling of this gap was therefore the main aim of of this publication. Besides of the old findings analysis, enriched with specialized studies results, in the book we present also the results of studies of the reconstruction of original natural environment of the closest surroundings of the stronghold, as well as the site in Połupin against the broader settlement context. The essential part of this publication were also devoted to the issues connected with the chronology, based on the comparative analysis of the sherds and other artefacts (spurs and beam), and verified by the 14 C dating. The site 2 was discovered in the summer of 1961, during the detailed surface survey conducted by the expedition members, who were excavated the nearby stronghold in Krosno Odrzańskie. This summer from the half of July till the mid of September, Edward Dąbrowski conducted the excavations on the newly discovered site. The research was aimed to answer few questions about function of this feature, its size and chronology. Due to the complete lowering of the rampart constructions, basically it was not assumed that the studied feature might have been the relics of the stronghold. In total, during three seasons, the area of 2, 5 ares in 7 trenches was excavated, recognizing the stratigraphy of cultural layers, mainly in the north-south axis (with circa 10 ° to the east), what was documented on numerous colour outlines. Available documentation from the excavation is complemented by monochrome photographs, especially of the feature outlines. Publishing of this book was possible thanks to the financial support provided by the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage, within the program of the archaeological artefacts protection, priority 5. Part of presented here results, primarily those concerning 14 C dating, was financed within the grant of the National Center of Science. The stronghold in Połupin, site 2, was built in the Middle Odra River Valley, in th zone of upper edge of the left slope of the valley. Połupin surroundings are very characteristic place in the latitudinal Odra River Valley, which functioned in the late of last Glacial as a part of the Berlin-Warsaw ice marginal valley. Located here narrowing of the valley, clearly visible in the morphology, in which its broadness is dropping to circa 2 km. The position of defensive settlement allowed to control the situation in the bottom of the valley, which most likely was used as a main communication artery, joining with the northern Lusatia and Brandenburg on the west and Greater Poland and further Masovia on the east. The place for the stronghold location was chosen very carefully. It was built over 40 m over the valley bottom, what assured undisturbed look into the valley and gave opportunity for its continuous monitoring. The stronghold was located between two, well-formed denudative valleys, on the narrow denudative spur, driving between them, taking form of characteristic “tip”. The topography of the stronghold area and the closest surroundings played with certainty substantial role. There were some natural, defensive obstacles in form of steep, in some places even rugged, slopes of denudative spur and slope of the Odra River valley. The specific location of the stronghold in Połupin was affected on the one hand by encountered natural terrain relief characteristic, which in natural way guaranteed the defensive position and on the other hand the surface of the denudative spur was flat, what made easier carrying out all construction works. The geographical environment in the stronghold surroundings was pretty much diverse. What can be assumed, it offered to the early medieval society sufficient climate for farming and in many places also appropriate water conditions, however the living relief of left slope of the Odra River valley most likely excluded carrying out any economic activity on this area. This was only possible on the nearby bottom of the Odra River valley. There were some good natural conditions for creating meadow lands and grazing, for carrying out breeding, pastoralism and inland fishery. Good communication between the lands of economic activity in the bottom of valley and the place of people’s living on the denudative spur was provided by not strongly inclined numerous denudative valleys. Due to the modest slopes of the bottoms of denudative valleys it was easy to reach between the Odra River valley and adjacent hill (wysoczyzna). Thanks to small slopes of the bottoms of denudative valleys it was possible to access between Odra River valley and adjacent hills. Considering poor sandy-gravel ground and developed from them soils of low class of fertility and in order of lack of permanent, surface water, hill (wysoczyzna) fluvioglacial hill near the Odra River valley was most likely not very attractive area for the early medieval society. In order to reconstruct natural, basic environment a palynological analysis were carried out. A core of mineral and organic sediments was drilled from an oxbow in Odra valley. Samples for pollen analysis were taken every 4 or 2 cm in the upper part of the core. Pollen diagram reveals changes in regional and local plant communities during the last 3000 years BP. Mixed pine-oak forest and deciduous forests with Querus, Carpinus betulus, Ulmus and Corylus avellana were the main types of regional ecosystems. On local habitats expansive areas of Alnus communities were found. There were only some open plants communities. Three phases of human activity were found. The first took place in the Bronze Age, the second one during the Roman Period. The last phase is related to the early middle ages when an embankment existed nearby to the research site. The landscape changed significantly. Clear deforestation is observed and first of all Alnus forest diminished. The area was occupied by anthropogenic ecosystems instead. A lot of open plant communities appeared. Presence of many herbs like Rumex or Plantago lanceolata indicates significance of meadows and pastures. Cultivation of cereals and other crops was not so important. Proportions and quantity of appearance of particular groups of indicators in relation to presence and human activity suggest that economic of society from Połupin was mostly based on breeding and cultivations was rather a supplement ensuring dietary enrichment. Zooarchaeological analysis shown that animal breeding had crucial impact on overall economic of inhabitants of the stronghold in Połupin. The excavations carried out in Połupin had provided crucial information about the development of the area surrounded by the rampart. Due to the incomplete preserved documentation, it was not possible to precisely situate the location of some features, however it did not prevent to distinguish few characteristic elements of development, both residential, economic and defensive. Residential part of the stronghold was most likely located along the inner part of the walls, i. e. in the safest place in the stronghold, in so called blind spot of fire. The courtyard, besides few, most likely, residential features (pits 1 and 2), was occupied by the features of processing function (probably birch-tar pit and smoke pit) and by the close undefined constructions, from which only post holes remained. Basing on the NMT analysis one can propose a hypothesis that the stronghold was surrounded from the west, south and east by horseshoe-like rampart, and from the north, i. e. Odra River valley, another kind of defensive system functioned, in form of stone enforced terraces incised in the strongly steep slope. However to verify this hypothesis further excavations are required. Post deposit processes caused almost complete destruction of the relics of walls. Their remains were traceable only in the south-western and south-eastern part of the stronghold, although we cannot say much about its construction. This remark concerns also construction techniques used in building of the elements of the courtyard development. The choice of location place of the stronghold was based on the defensive characters offered by the nature. The place where it was build was limited from the west and east by deep denudative valleys, which besides defensive feature, could have been also used as a communication routes between stronghold and used for economic activities, the Odra River valley. The northern foreground, besides hypothetical, artificial terraces system, was limited by wet river valley. Significant reason for which one decided to elaborate archive finds from the stronghold in Połupin was the need for verification the chronology of the fortress and discovered there artefacts. The most numerous category of sources are fragment of vessels. Basing on the macroscopic analysis (study of style, form and technology of manufacture) and using specialist investigations we believe that that ceramic discovered in Połupin represents two pottery styles. First, traditional one, corresponds to the older phases of the Middle Ages. These include: small range of coating, lack of decoration, poor profile and appearance of mainly undeveloped rims. Second, progressive stream, are the vessels perfectly, technologically produced, manufactured from especially prepared mass of clay, based on selected, fine-grained temper. This course is represented by vessels of mainly stocky, vase-like forms. Their characteristic feature is decoration in form of plastic rollers (from one to few), placed under the rim. Their origin can be traced primarily in Merovingian pottery workshops, which had produced, mainly in the 7 th century, the so called Knickwandtőpfe. Using the data concerned of vessels style and technique of manufacture, which were gathered during the study of numerous collections of pottery from the Middle Odra River Area, we can try to establish chronological position of discovered assemblage of vessels. The analysis indicates quite high percentage of coated vessels (circa 65...|$|R
