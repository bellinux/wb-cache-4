25|$|Though {{some species}} are quite drab, the most {{conspicuous}} jewel bugs are often brilliantly colored, exhibiting {{a wide range of}} iridescent metallic hues that change with the <b>view</b> <b>angle.</b> The colors are the result of a combination of factors. Some species like Chrsyocoris stockerus and Scutellera nobilis display colors from multiple thin layers of pigmented chitin. The colors often change or become duller when the specimens are dried, due to the topmost chitinous layer becoming opaque and obscuring the colors of the bottom layer. The colors can be restored by moistening the surfaces with water.|$|E
25|$|Earth's surface albedo is {{regularly}} estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASA's MODIS instruments {{on board the}} Terra and Aqua satellites, and the CERES instrument on the Suomi NPP and JPSS. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional-hemispherical reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,). These calculations {{are based on the}} bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> of the observer and the solar angle. Thereby, the BRDF allows to translate observations of reflectance into albedo.|$|E
500|$|Preliminary {{designer}} Dick Scherrer requested possible shapes {{upon which}} he could base his low radar cross-section (RCS) design. He was introduced to Denys Overholser, who recommended an aircraft with flat surfaces. Overholser later recounted his discussion with Sherrer: [...] "When Dick Scherrer asked me ... I said 'Well, it's simple, you just {{make it out of}} flat surfaces, and tilt those flat surfaces over, sweeping the edges away from the radar <b>view</b> <b>angle,</b> and that way you basically cause the energy to reflect away from the radar.'" [...] Scherrer subsequently drew a preliminary low-RCS aircraft with faceted surfaces. At the same time, Overholser hired mathematician Bill Schroeder, with whom he had a prior working relationship – in fact, it was Schroeder who trained Overholser on mathematics relating to stealth aircraft. Kenneth Watson was hired as the senior lead aircraft designer.|$|E

There is {{a desire}} for a display {{technology}} which can change the display <b>viewing</b> <b>angle.</b> Controllable <b>Viewing</b> <b>Angle</b> (CVA) device has been developed by using a Guest-Host liquid crystal cell which allows a high light-shielding effect and the control {{with a wide range}} of available <b>viewing</b> <b>angle.</b> By putting the CVA device on a Thin-Film Transistor (TFT) Liquid-Crystal Panel, or placing a Guest-Host Liquid Crystal (GHLC) device between the LED and the backlight, we have realized a simple controllable viewing-angle LCD which could be switched in the narrow and normal(wide) <b>viewing</b> <b>angle.</b> The <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> can decrease to 40 ° when power is on but it also can shift to normal <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> when power is off...|$|R

40|$|Gait {{is a well}} {{recognized}} {{biometric feature}} {{that is used to}} identify a human at a distance. However, in real environment, appearance changes of individuals due to <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> changes cause many difficulties for gait recognition. This paper re-formulates this problem as a regression problem. A novel solution is proposed to create a View Transformation Model (VTM) from the different point of view using Support Vector Regression (SVR). To facilitate the process of regression, a new method is proposed to seek local Region of Interest (ROI) under one <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> for predicting the corresponding motion information under another <b>viewing</b> <b>angle.</b> Thus, the well constructed VTM is able to transfer gait information under one <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> into another <b>viewing</b> <b>angle.</b> This proposal can achieve viewindependent gait recognition. It normalizes gait features under various <b>viewing</b> <b>angles</b> into a common <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> before similarity measurement is carried out. The extensive experimental results based on widely adopted benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve significantly better performance than the existing methods in literature. 1...|$|R

Consequently, the current method to define the viewing cone, with a fixed contrast ratio, does not represent perceived performance differences between displays. Our previous study, with two LCDs and a plasma display, revealed that changes in image quality with <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> are predicted by combining luminance variations and white-point shifts for an intermediate grey level. In this paper, we show that, for viewers comparing the <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> dependent quality between displays, that same relation holds. If the calculated <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> is larger than the measured acceptability threshold, the remaining quality at the threshold angle serves as a <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> performance indicator. © 2008 Elsevier B.

2500|$|A {{compound}} eye may {{consist of}} thousands of individual photoreceptor units or ommatidia (ommatidium, singular). The image perceived {{is a combination of}} inputs from the numerous ommatidia (individual [...] "eye units"), which are located on a convex surface, thus pointing in slightly different directions. Compared with simple eyes, compound eyes possess a very large <b>view</b> <b>angle,</b> and can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the polarisation of light. Because the individual lenses are so small, the effects of diffraction impose a limit on the possible resolution that can be obtained (assuming that they do not function as phased arrays). This can only be countered by increasing lens size and number. To see with a resolution comparable to our simple eyes, humans would require very large compound eyes, around [...] in radius.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Miguel Román, is a {{research}} physical scientist with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). A major focus of Román's work is the quantiﬁcation of uncertainty in long-term satellite measurements of the Earth's surface at both moderate and high spatial resolutions. Román has developed a [...] combination of global quality assessment and validation techniques that include visible, near-infrared, and multi-angular imagery and measurements acquired from in-situ and airborne platforms. His efforts to improve narrowband reflectance anisotropy models to estimate the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) of land surfaces have led to major advancements in the estimation of terrestrial essential climate variables routinely used to monitor human activity and natural disturbances from satellite platforms. As a lead member of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Land Discipline teams, Román's research has enabled scientists to quantify {{how much of the}} variations in satellite observations are due to sensor performance, terrain, and/or geometry (<b>view</b> <b>angle)</b> effects; a critical factor when the satellite data are used to [...] drive policy related to global climate change. Most recently, Dr. Román’s research has focused on capturing seasonal variations in nighttime lights using measurements from the VIIRS Day/Night Band on Suomi-NPP.|$|E

30|$|It {{can be seen}} in Fig. 6 {{that the}} <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> of the {{integral}} imaging system based on polarizers and light barriers array has been significantly improved. By comparing the different view images horizontally, different parallax information can be obtained. In the range of ± 33 °, you can get the correct reconstructed image of the whole scene. The proposed method is about approximately 4 times the <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> of the conventional integral imaging. The different wide-viewing integral three-dimensional imaging methods proposed by Refs. [9, 10] can improve the field angle to a certain extent, but cannot more than 2 times the original <b>viewing</b> <b>angle.</b> In both modes of our manuscript, the <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> can be enlarged more than 2 times which is the main difference between the proposed system and the previous methods. The increment of <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> can be determined by the number of light barriers, the more the light barrier, the lager the <b>viewing</b> <b>angle.</b> When one light baffles array is used, the field angle will be enlarged 4 times as conventional method. The size of each elemental image can be enlarged as any positive integer multiples as the pitch of the lenslet. Thus, the <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> of the integral imaging system can be improved dramatically by the improvement of the size of each elemental image according to the integral imaging principles.|$|R
