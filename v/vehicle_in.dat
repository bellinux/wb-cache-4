30|$|We {{will first}} {{investigate}} the achievable indirect connectivity based on multi-hop forwarding. Here, we discuss three cases: (1). Indirect connectivity in a platoon {{on a single}} lane when <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> this platoon are connected to each other; (2). Indirect connectivity for vehicles on a single lane with helps from <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> adjacent lanes, when multi-hop forwarding {{could not be obtained}} on this single lane; (3). Indirect connectivity for <b>vehicles</b> on multi-lane. <b>In</b> the first case, all <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> a lane are connected to each other forming a platoon. However, in the second case, there are communication gaps between <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> a single lane. Therefore, we introduce <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> adjacent lanes to fill the gaps and obtain the indirect connectivity. In the third case, by combining the above two cases, we obtained the general probability expression for multi-hop indirect connectivity in multi-lane scenario.|$|R

50|$|The {{adoption}} of plug-in electric <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> the Netherlands is actively {{supported by the}} Dutch government through the exemption of the registration fee and road taxes. These purchase incentives have been adjusted over time. Considering the potential of plug-in electric <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> the country due to its relative small size and geography, the Dutch government set a target of 15,000 to 20,000 electric vehicles with three or more wheels on the roads <b>in</b> 2015; 200,000 <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> 2020; and 1 million <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> 2025. The first government target was achieved in 2013, two years earlier, thanks to the sales peak that occurred {{at the end of}} 2013.

5|$|Alongside {{rush hour}} traffic, {{thousands}} of residents in Oklahoma City attempted to outrun the storm by {{taking to the}} roads {{in an attempt to}} drive out of the tornado's projected path.

5|$|Although Katia passed well {{north of}} the Lesser Antilles, a yellow alert was hoisted for Guadeloupe to notify {{residents}} of dangerous seas. Strong rip currents along the East Coast of the United States led {{to the deaths of}} two swimmers. After losing its tropical characteristics, Katia prompted the issuance of numerous warnings across Europe. Hurricane-force winds impacted numerous locations, downing trees, toppling power poles, and leaving thousands without electricity. The storm was responsible for two deaths in the United Kingdom: one when a tree fell on a <b>vehicle</b> <b>in</b> County Durham, and another during a multi-car accident on the M54 motorway resulting from adverse weather conditions. The post-tropical cyclone caused approximately £100m ($157million, 2011 USD) in damage in the United Kingdom alone.|$|E

Another unusual <b>vehicle</b> <b>in</b> the Kelvin fleet was the only Leyland Lynx bought by Scottish Bus Group, which was delivered new in 1989. Six rare Leyland Lion double-deckers were ordered in 1988, but owing to a large cut in Kelvin's peak vehicle requirement they did not enter service with the company and were instead sent to Clydeside Scottish.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, KKR {{filed with}} the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise $1.25 billion by selling an {{ownership}} interest in its management company.

KKR had previously listed its KPE <b>vehicle</b> <b>in</b> 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened the prospects of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.|$|E
