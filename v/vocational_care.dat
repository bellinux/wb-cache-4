The research was peer led by Client Forum representatives of five 'Special Community Employment' schemes and {{aimed to explore}} participant experiences of Methadone Stabilization; 'Special Community Employment' schemes, and Vocational Outcomes. A Client Forum consultation (n = 11) and Client Forum representative focus groups (n = 2) were used to finalize interview questions. In depth interviews with {{a convenience sample of}} participants from 'Special Community Employment' schemes (n = 25) were conducted. Content and thematic analysis of narratives was undertaken with Client Forum (n = 11) interpretative support. The findings are indicative of 'Special Community Employment' schemes offering methadone maintenance participants' the opportunity to commence recovery, engage in {{vocational training}} and reintegrate into the community. However, participation in these schemes appeared restrictive and operated primarily as therapeutic medium, with little individual <b>vocational</b> <b>care</b> planning, training or supported work placements. Many participants reported leaving these schemes unqualified, unemployed and experiencing little aftercare. The research underscores the need for extensive revision of 'Special Community Employment' schemes within an interagency approach, so as to provide specific therapeutic supports dependent on individual recovery stage, and client specific vocational training needs, certification, work placement and supportive aftercare...|$|E

Effectiveness of {{supported}} employment for veterans with spinal cord injuries: {{results from a}} randomized multisite study. Objective: To examine whether {{supported employment}} (SE) {{is more effective than}} treatment as usual (TAU) in returning veterans to competitive employment after spinal cord injury (SCI). Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled, multisite trial of SE versus TAU for vocational issues with 12 months of follow-up data. Setting: SCI centers in the Veterans Health Administration. Participants: Subjects (N= 201) were enrolled and completed baseline interviews. In interventional sites, subjects were randomly assigned to the SE condition (n= 81) or the TAU condition (treatment as usual–interventional site [TAU-IS], n= 76). In observational sites where the SE program was not available, 44 subjects were enrolled in a nonrandomized TAU condition (treatment as usual– observational site [TAU-OS]). Interventions: The intervention consisted of an SE vocational rehabilitation program called the Spinal Cord Injury Vocational Integration Program, which adhered as closely as possible to principles of SE as developed and described in the individual placement and support model of SE for persons with mental illness. Main Outcome Measures: The primary study outcome measurement was competitive employment in the community. Results: Subjects in the SE group were 2. 5 times more likely than the TAU-IS group and 11. 4 times more likely than the TAU-OS group to obtain competitive employment. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and only controlled study of a specific vocational rehabilitation program to report improved employment outcomes for persons with SCI. SE, a well-prescribed method of integrated <b>vocational</b> <b>care,</b> was superior to usual practices in improving employment outcomes for veterans with SCI...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores how a {{group of}} 83 young, white, working class women became {{involved}} in the state's most recent attempt at restructuring social relations through vocational initiatives. Using ethnographic research conducted in a caring course department of a northern further education college, it examines how the students everyday practical experiences of the <b>vocational</b> <b>caring</b> curriculum involves them in the construction of subjectivity and gender and class reproduction. The central argument is that caring courses are little more than domestic apprenticeships which anticipate both the family household structure and the labour market. The students implicate themselves in this process, through their attempts to gain autonomy and self‐esteem, by constructing ‘ideal’ caring standards, which come to prioritise exclusive, familial forms of care over and above occupational roles. Thus, they socialise themselves out of the labour market and establish familial responsibilities, which can be drawn upon by the state to maintain unpaid welfare provision...|$|R

Less {{is known about the}} impact of these programs on the skills and specific knowledge of trainees. We aimed to evaluate the Cantonal program for <b>vocational</b> primary <b>care</b> training in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland’s largest Canton. Methods: We undertook a pretest–posttest study and surveyed physicians before and after participating in the Cantonal program for <b>vocational</b> primary <b>care</b> training in the Swiss Canton of Zurich. All trainees who participated in the program from 2013 until the end of 2015 were eligible. Primary outcome was the proportion of trainees being confident about their professional, organizational, examination and management skills before and after completing vocational training. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of trainees stating knowledge gain in entrepreneurship and the proportion of trainees being motivated to pursue a career as PCP. Results: Data of 47 trainees participating in the vocational training between 2013 and 2015 were eligible. In total, 35 (74. 5 %) participated in the T 1 survey and 34 (72. 3 %) in the T 2 survey. At T 2, significantly more trainees (T 1 : 11 %− 89 %, T 2 : 79 %− 100 %) stated to be at least “slightly confident” about their skills (p< 0. 05 for each individual skill). Knowledge gain in entrepreneurship was highly expected and experienced by the trainees (55 %− 77 % of respondents) in case of medicine-specific contents, but hardly expected in case of general business contents (≤ 47 % of respondents). Concerning trainees’ motivation to pursue a career as PCP, we observed only a minimal, statistically insignificant change, suggesting that the vocational training did not alter trainees’ preconceived career plans as PCP. Conclusion: Given the measured increase in confidence, evaluation of training programs should focus on operationalizing key skills of PCPs. Given the lack of change in trainees’ motivation; however, statements about the effect of program implementation on national shortage of PCPs cannot be made.

30|$|The {{results showed}} some {{interesting}} patterns. In the three large city areas, {{nearly all of}} the participants represented the <b>vocational</b> areas of <b>Care,</b> Practical-Aesthetical, or Service, which did not reflect the distribution of education and teachers across the different areas. Outside these regions, the areas of Vehicles and, to some extent, Technology were over-represented in the participation pattern. The high-population municipalities are of particular interest; as shown above, the participation rate was higher than expected. Here, CPD participation was particularly high in the area of Technology, which was also the area with the highest volume in terms of teacher positions in these regions. However, there were no large differences between the distribution of teacher positions and CPD participation across the vocational areas in this group of municipalities; Technology, Vehicles, and Service were slightly over-represented, and the other areas were slightly under-represented.|$|R
