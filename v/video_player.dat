The night after the exhibit opens, Mary and other ACT UP members break into the Hall of Contagion and trash the exhibit. Zero returns and Burton explains {{that he tried to}} stop the exhibit. Zero forgives Burton but says he wants to disappear again completely. Zero merges with his disfigured video image and, smoking a cigarette inside the video, sets off the fire alarm. The sprinklers destroy the <b>video</b> <b>player</b> and Zero vanishes.|$|E

25|$|The PlayStation Portable {{became the}} most {{powerful}} portable system when launched, just after the Nintendo DS in 2004. It was the first real competitor to Nintendo's handheld domination, where many challengers, such as SNK's Neo Geo Pocket and Nokia's N-Gage, failed. Its GPU encompassed high-end graphics on a handheld, while its 4.3 inch viewing screen and multi-media capabilities, such as its <b>video</b> <b>player</b> and TV tuner, made the PlayStation Portable a major mobile entertainment device at the time. It also features connectivity with the PlayStation 3, other PSPs and the Internet. It is the only handheld console to use an optical disc format, Universal Media Disc (UMD), as its primary storage medium.|$|E
25|$|There are two cinemas in Antananarivo {{and one in}} Mahajanga, all {{dating from}} the colonial era, but none show {{standard}} international releases or operate on a regular schedule. These venues instead occasionally screen Malagasy films or are used for private events and religious services. Hollywood blockbuster films and some international films, particularly including martial arts, horror and action releases, are typically broadcast on television and purchased as bootleg DVDs or digital media files in major urban areas. Bruce Lee has historically been very popular in Madagascar. In smaller towns, films are often shown at improvised movie houses typically consisting of benches in a room fitted with a television and <b>video</b> <b>player.</b> Most films are dubbed into French.|$|E

40|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} that playing action video games improves performance {{on a number of}} attention-based tasks. However, it remains unclear whether action video game experience primarily affects endogenous or exogenous forms of spatial orienting. To examine this issue, action <b>video</b> game <b>players</b> and non-action <b>video</b> game <b>players</b> performed an attentional capture task. The results show that action <b>video</b> game <b>players</b> responded quicker than non-action <b>video</b> game <b>players,</b> both when a target appeared in isolation and when a salient, task-irrelevant distractor was present in the display. Action <b>video</b> game <b>players</b> additionally showed a smaller capture effect than did non-action <b>video</b> game <b>players.</b> When coupled with the findings of previous studies, the collective evidence indicates that extensive experience with action video games may enhance players' top-down attentional control, which, in turn, can modulate the negative effects of bottom-up attentional capture. © 2010 The Psychonomic Society, Inc...|$|R
