40|$|Within the HHI Broadband Communications System, besides some digital, optical {{subscriber}} lines {{an analog}} optical subscriber {{line has been}} installed, offering as well simultaneously three color-TV-programs, one <b>videophone</b> <b>channel,</b> four stereo-broadcast programmes and additional channels for telephone and data to the subscriber. In {{order to make a}} statement about the quality of that analog optical broadband-transmission- line employed for that, extensive measurements of the signal-to-noise ratios in the TV- and stereo-broadcast channel, the signal-to-cross- modulation ratio in the frequency range of the TV-channels, the cross-talk attenuation and the harmonic ratio in the stereo-broadcast channel have been performed. Results however show, that the quality standards for national CATV-Systems cannot be achieved by this optical analog link with its load of the frequency band and with the employment of the AM-IM-modulation for TV- and videophone signals...|$|E
40|$|The complexity, robustness, {{image and}} speech quality {{as well as}} packet {{multiplexing}} issues of a re-configurable multi-media mobile communicator are addressed. The proposed moderate complexity motion-compensated Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based image communicator provides an image peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 38 dB at an average bit rate of about 25 kbits/s. The speech codec used is a low-complexity 32 kbit/s CCITT G 721 standard scheme. Bandwidth efficient 16 or 64 level quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) combined with embedded low-complexity binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) forward error correction (FEC) coding is deployed. The 20 -slot packet reservation multiple access (PRMA) scheme used supports an extra 2. 4 kbit/s low-rate data channel for each speech user {{in addition to providing}} 5 - 6 <b>videophone</b> <b>channels.</b> The ADPCM/DCT/BCH/ 16 -QAM and ADPCM/DCT/BCH/ 64 -QAM schemes provide nearly unimpaired speech and image quality for channel SNRs in excess of 30 dB and 38 dB, respectively...|$|R
