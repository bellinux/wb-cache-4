Among various treatment methods, co-pyrolysis of PVC with metal oxides, particularly (iron oxide), constitutes an appropriate disposal technique {{from the point}} view of enviromnental safeguard or energy recovery.

This contribution provides a systematic theoretical kinetic study of the initial interplay of hematite nanopatiicles with chlorine-bearing compounds (namely as hydrogen chloride, chloroethene, 1 - chloro- 1 -propene, chloroethane, 2 -chloropropane, chlorobenzene and 2 -chlorophenol) that are released from the degradation of PVC. A detailed kinetic analysis points out that, subsequent addition of HCl to Fe(Cl) -O(H) structures leads to convert Fe 20 3 into oxychlorines and iron chlorides. Then, elimination of HzO molecule proceeds via an intramolecular hydrogen transfer. The analyses of the transition structures indicate that, there are two possible pathways to operate in the reaction of chlorinated alkanes and alkenes with a-Fe 20 3 clusters, i. e., direct elimination and dissociative addition. These two pathways assume competing significance in formation of acetylene from <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride.</b> Results from this study should be instrumental to understand on a precise molecular basis fixation of halogens on transitional metal oxides; a viable recycling options for polymeric materials laden with halogenated constituents...|$|R

They also recommended long-term animal toxicology studies. The study noted that if a chemical did justify the cost of testing, and its ill-effects on workers and the public were known, the chemical should not be made.

Also in 1963, a Romanian researcher published findings of liver disease in <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> workers. In 1968, Mutchler and Kramer, two Dow researchers, reported their finding that exposures as low as 300 ppm caused liver damage in <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> workers thus confirming earlier animal data in humans. In a 1969 presentation given in Japan, P. L. Viola, a European researcher working for the European <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> industry, indicated, [...] "every monomer used in V.C. manufacture is hazardous....various changes were found in bone and liver.

[...] In light of the finding of liver damage in rats from just 4–10 ppm of <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> exposure, Viola added that he [...] "should like some precautions to be taken in the manufacturing plants polymerizing <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride,</b> such as a reduction of the threshold limit value of monomer …" [...] In 1970, Viola, reported that test animals exposed to 30,000 ppm of <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> developed cancerous tumors.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} {{incidence}} of angiosarcoma of the liver in England and Wales 1979 - 86 and Scotland 1975 - 87. To investigate whether any non-occupational neighbourhood cases occurred near a <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> site. METHODS: This is a geographical study of incident cases among {{the general population of}} Great Britain. Diagnosis of angiosarcoma of the liver was based mainly on the national cancer registry, the world register of cases among <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> workers, and the register of cases (including histological review) maintained by the Health and Safety Executive. Proximity (< 10 km) of residence to a <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> site was based on postcode of address at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: 55 cases were ascribed to angiosarcoma of the liver in England and Wales with a further six cases in Scotland (annual incidence in Great Britain from all sources of around 1. 4 cases per 10 million population). There were two cases with documented exposure to Thorotrast, and 10 cases among <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> workers. There were no <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> sites in Scotland. Among the 25 cases in England and Wales with histological diagnosis after review by a panel of pathologists, only 15 were confirmed as angiosarcoma, and one of the two Scottish cases after histological review was also confirmed. Overall, 11 cases ascribed to angiosarcoma were resident within 10 km of a <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> site; nine were <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> workers, one further case on histological review was not considered to have been correctly diagnosed as angiosarcoma, and the remaining case, confirmed as angiosarcoma, was employed at a <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> factory during the late 1950 s, although not as a <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> worker. CONCLUSION: The incidence of angiosarcoma of the liver in Great Britain remains extremely rare. The one confirmed case in a non-vinyl chloride worker within 10 km of a site must nevertheless be presumed to have been exposed to <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> in the workplace. In the period of study, there were no confirmed non-occupationally exposed cases of angiosarcoma among residents living near a <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> site in Great Britain...|$|R
