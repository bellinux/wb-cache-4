40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{research}} has been two fold. The first stage {{was to develop a}} Tri <b>Vane</b> <b>Apparatus.</b> The Tri <b>Vane</b> <b>Apparatus</b> uses a miniature vane incorporated into a triaxial cell in order to study the use of the vane in different soils as well as allowing the effects of different vane parameters, such as rotation rate and vane geometry, to be studied in controlled conditions. Initial research was conducted into the history of this device with special emphasis on any previous designs. The design used in the current research has incorporated many design aspects used in these previous devices but has also made several improvements. This leads into the second stage of this research. Since the development of the vane test in 1948 by Cadling and Odenstad (1948), the test has almost exclusively been used {{for the study of the}} undrained shear strength of clays. This research has investigated the use of the vane test in sands. Through the use of the Tri <b>Vane</b> <b>Apparatus</b> constructed in the first stage of this research, extensive testing has been conducted on sand, in both isotropic and anisotropic stress conditions.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a procedure for hydraulic design {{and analysis of}} the blade geometry of a high specific speed runner of the Saxo-type double-regulated vertical axial turbine. The meridional through-flow in the passage from the conical guide <b>vane</b> <b>apparatus</b> to the draft-tube elbow is designed by a streamline curvature method (SCM). To validate the design method and predictions and to investigate the design duty point and a number of off-design operating regimes, an extensive CFD simulation inside the entire turbine water-passage is performed. The flow patterns downstream the guide <b>vane</b> <b>apparatus</b> and the runner exit flow are analyzed. The focus of the analysis is on distribution of the angular momentum alongside the turbine, as well as on its impact on the flow around the runner blades. The SCM design procedure presented in the paper proves to be a robust and accurate tool for the runner blade row design...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the suitability of a laboratory <b>vane</b> <b>apparatus,</b> a cone penetrometer as well as a shear vane tester and a pocket penetrometer for determination of the parameters of the undrained shear strength of fly ash from the Power Plant “Skawina”. The suitability of the cone penetrometer and the laboratory <b>vane</b> <b>apparatus</b> for the determination of the undrained shear strength of the fly ash has been shown. On the bases of the obtained test results,, drained and undrained shear strengths of the subsoil made of the fly ash under the square pad foundation were calculated according to Eurocode 7. The calculations of the ultimate resistance of the drained subsoil showed that it was several times bigger than its value in undrained conditions. This confirms the need for the proper determination of the angle of internal friction and cohesion as well as the undrained shear strength of fly ashes...|$|E

The liquid limit of the samples is determined by Casagrande Method and Fall Cone Method. All tests are performed by the same person and same equipments to avoid operator and equipment error.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe sophisticated <b>vane</b> shear <b>apparatus</b> {{for determining the}} shear strength of deep ocean sediment cores was modified {{so as to be}} portable and versatile for use In a laboratory and on board a ship. The apparatus utilizes a torque transducer that is insensitive to temperature changes or orientation and capable of measuring torque over the entire range of shear strength encountered in marine sediments. Shear strength measurements can be made with minimum disturbance to the sediment sample by testing directly in the core liner. The apparatus was used to determine shear strength of ten deep ocean cores from the Guide Seamount region, located about 70 miles west of the central California coast. The study also included the determination of other engineering properties of the sediment cores. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} basic {{components}} of a methodology to investigate two key aspects of the mechanical behaviour of some natural clays, namely the dependency of the undrained shear strength on the rate of shearing, and the softening response at large strains. For that, we will use a blend of novel experimental testing procedures and cutting-edge computational techniques, currently under development at the University of Newcastle. Measurements of the shear stress-strain response under undrained conditions will be obtained using a newly developed miniature <b>vane</b> shear <b>apparatus,</b> featuring automatic control of the blade rotation velocity. Laboratory tests will be complemented with large- deformation numerical simulations of the vane test with the coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian method. For that, an appropriate constitutive model is implemented in ABAQUS/Explicit, able to simulate the visco-plastic strain-softening response of soft clays. Testing will be performed on the soft estuarine clay samples retrieved from the national geotechnical soft soil field testing facility, established in Ballina, NSW. With the focus being on Australian soft clays, the long-term goal {{of this study is}} to improve the procedures for performing and interpreting in situ tests included in Australian Standards...|$|R

40|$|Mature fine {{tailings}} (MFT), as {{a mixture}} of residual bitumen, sand, silt, fine clay particles and water, are a byproduct of oil sands extraction. The large volume, and poor consolidation and water release ability of MFT have been causing significant economic and environmental concerns. Therefore, several studies have been implemented on finding innovative dewatering/disposal techniques. As a result, different methods have been introduced and tested at a laboratory or a field scale, yet very few of these are commercially used in the oil sands industries. Despite the extensive research, an optimal solution has not been found {{due to the lack}} of technical or economic feasibility. In the present study, a novel approach that consists of the rapid dewatering of MFT by using a super absorbent polymer (SAP) to produce dense MFT is proposed. A comprehensive laboratory investigation on the geotechnical characteristics and behavior before and after treatment of MFT is conducted. The effects of SAP based dewatering and freeze/thaw cycles on the undrained shear strength of dewatered MFT by using a <b>vane</b> shear <b>apparatus</b> are studied. Furthermore, the ability of recycled SAP to dewater and densify MFT is assessed. Finally, thi...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the undrained shear strength, su, and overconsolidation ratio, OCR, of clay material (kaolin clay) is important in order to estimate the material strength for preparing the ground model for small scale physical modeling test. In this study, the {{relationship between}} these parameters is determined using a modified Rowe cell equipped with a vane shear blade. Kaolin samples were prepared under different consolidation ratios and the unit weight of kaolin is measured using the modified Rowe cell device, while the undrained shear strength, su, was determined using the <b>vane</b> shear <b>apparatus.</b> It was found that the values of the consolidation ratio, CR, were inversely proportionate to su. A correlation between su and OCR was established based on the laboratory results and validated with several previous studies. In addition, a comparison was made between the developed equation and some existing equations from the literature. It was found that the proposed equation provide a close prediction to the previous laboratory results with a Root Mean Square Error less than 1. 2. A difference arose due to the different types of clay used between previous and current studies. A positive relationship is established between the unit weight and OCR values for kaolin clay...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The field {{vane shear}} test {{is one of the}} most common in situ tests to obtain the {{undrained}} shear strength of soft clay. Uncoupling of the torque generated by the soil resistance along the vertical and horizontal planes of the vane has been done by conducting conventional direct shear test and newly developed vertical direct shear test on the soil. From the shear stress-displacement relationship of the direct shear tests, simple analysis is performed to simulate the field vane behavior at various depths. The results of the simulation agree well with those obtained from the field vane tests on soft Bangkok clay. The conventional method of computing the undrained shear strength of the field vane shear based on the maximum torque is close to the equivalent average value from the shear box tests. A special laboratory triaxial <b>vane</b> <b>apparatus</b> was also used to study the shear-ing behavior of the soft clay with the capability of Ko-consolidating the sample before conducting the {{vane shear test}}. The results of the triaxial vane tests were also compared with the predictions. The predicted torque values are lower than the experimental data for the same angle of rotation...|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} of cohesive sediments of a saltmarsh in Southern England {{was measured in}} the field and the laboratory using a Cohesive Strength Meter (CSM) and a shear <b>vane</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Cores and sediment samples were collected from two tidal creek banks, covered by Atriplex portulacoides (Sea Purslane) and Juncus maritimus (Sea Rush), respectively. The objectives of the study were to examine the variation of sediment stability throughout banks with cantilevers present and investigate the influence of roots and downcore consolidation on bank stability. Data on erosion threshold and shear strength were interpreted with reference to bank depth, sediment properties and biological influences. The higher average erosion threshold was from the Sea Purslane bank whilst the Sea Rush bank showed higher average vane shear strength. The vertical variation in core sediment stability was mainly affected by roots and downcore consolidation with depth. The data obtained from the bank faces revealed that vertical variations in both erosion threshold and vane shear strength were affected primarily by roots and algae. A quantitative estimate of the relative contributions of roots and downcore consolidation to bank sediment stability was undertaken using the bank stability data and sediment density data. This showed that roots contributed more to the Sea Purslane bank stability than downcore consolidation, whilst downcore consolidation has more pronounced effects on the Sea Rush bank stability...|$|E

40|$|Because of fuel consumption, {{machinery}} and labor costs, tillage involves high expenses. In {{a project that}} {{was carried out in}} the autumn of 2001 and 2002, energy consumption and draught were studied for three tillage implements on a lighter and a heavier soil under wet, moist and dry conditions. Furthermore, aggregate size distribution and energy requirement for fracturing the soil were measured. The tillage implements used were mouldboard plough, chisel plough and disc cultivator. The effects of driving speed and depth of tillage were also studied. Soil strength was measured with both a penetrometer and a shear <b>vane</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The tractor used was a Valmet 6600 (100 hp) with equipment for measuring fuel consumption. The equipment was calibrated to give the PTO effect for any combination of fuel consumption and engine speed, and this was assumed to be the same as the effect available at the tractor wheels. The “tow bar power” was calculated by subtraction of power losses through wheel slip and rolling resistance. Average actual working depth was calculated by measuring bulk density before tillage and then weighing the cultivated soil. On the basis of the tillage depth and PTO effect measurements, it was possible to calculate energy requirement per kg cultivated soil and specific draught. The latter is defined as force per cross sectional area cultivated soil [kN/m 2]. After sieving samples of the cultivated soil, the approximate surface area of the fragmented soil and the energy requirement for fracturing were computed. Specific draught was lowest for the mouldboard plough, while the highest values were obtained for the chisel plough. Specific draught decreased with increasing soil water content. The lowest values of energy requirement for fracturing were measured under moist conditions for all tillage implements, and the disc cultivator produced the highest fracturing in relation to energy input. Both specific draught and energy requirement for fracturing were lower for the lighter soil. With the disc cultivator, specific draught increased with working depth, while depth had no influence on specific draught when the mouldboard plough was used. Some of these differences can be explained by differences in geometry between the tools. There was a tendency for specific draught to increase with increased driving speed. This was most obvious on the lighter soil and for the mouldboard plough. The increased draught can be explained by a higher acceleration of soil particles and by increased soil strength because of higher deformation rate. Soil strength and thereby draught requirement differed between soils and moisture contents. There was a strong correlation between soil cohesion and draught requirement, and cohesion was easily measured in the field with a shear vane. The penetrometer measurements did not correlate with draught measurements. Specific draught was lowest for the mouldboard plough. When considering the overall results of tillage, no one implement can be identified as being the most effective. Tillage at water content close to the plastic limit seems to be a good compromise as regards draught requirement and tillage result...|$|E
