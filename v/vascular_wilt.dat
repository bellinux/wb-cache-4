40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the {{potential}} reasons for the current prevalence of the fusarium wilt in the oriental melon. Twenty-seven Fusarium isolates obtained from oriental melon greenhouses in 2010 – 2011 were identified morphologically and by analysis of elongation factor- 1 alpha gene (EF- 1 α) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA sequences as 6 Fusarium species (8 isolates of F. oxysporum, 8 F. commune, 5 F. proliferatum, 3 F. equiseti, 2 F. delphinoides, and 1 F. andiyazi), which were classified as same into 6 EF- 1 α sequence-based phylogenetic clades. Pathogenicity of the Fusarium isolates on the oriental melon was highest in F. proliferatum, next in F. oxysporum and F. andiyazi, and lowest in the other Fusarium species tested, suggesting F. proliferatum and F. oxysporum were major pathogens of the oriental melon, inducing stem rots and <b>vascular</b> <b>wilts,</b> respectively. Oriental melon and watermelon were more susceptible to F. oxysporum than shintosa and cucumber; and cucumber was most, oriental melon and watermelon, medially, and shintosa was least susceptible to F. proliferatum, whose virulence varied among and within their phylogenetic subclades. Severe root-knot galls were formed on all the crops infected with Meloidogyne incognita; however, little indication of <b>vascular</b> <b>wilts</b> or stem and/or root rots was shown by the nematode infection. These results suggest the current fungal disease in the oriental melon may be rarely due to virulence changes of the fusarium wilt pathogen and the direct cause of the severe root-knot nematode infection, but may be potentially from other Fusarium pathogen infection that produces seemingly wilting caused by severe stem rotting...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Vascular</b> <b>wilting</b> in {{tomato plants}} is an {{important}} disease caused by soil-inhabiting pathogens, especially Verticillium dahliae, which results in significant production losses. Control measures against this disease are difficult to implement due to intrinsic pathogen characteristics, such as high adaptability to the subterranean environment, {{in association with the}} host, and development of resistance structures that remain viable in the soil for long periods. The introgression of genes that express resistance is the main control measure and requires a continuous characterization program of resistant accessions. This study aimed at identifying tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) accessions resistant to V. dahlia, by using the phenotypic and genotypic methods. The reaction of 33 tomato accessions to different V. dahliae isolates was reinforced by molecular analysis, through markers linked to Ve resistance genes. The combination of bioassays and specific molecular markers showed a high correlation (94. 3 %), with the selection of 25 accessions resistant to V. dahliae...|$|R

Control of Verticillium wilt has relied on a panoply of chemical and nonchemical strategies, but is beset with environmental or site-specific efficacy problems. Host resistance remains the most logical choice, but is unavailable in most crops. The genetic basis of resistance to Verticillium wilt is unknown in most crops, as are the subcellular signaling mechanisms associated with Ve-mediated, race-specific resistance.

40|$|The soil-borne fungus Fusarium oxysporum causes <b>vascular</b> <b>wilts</b> of a {{wide variety}} of plant species by {{directly}} penetrating roots and colonizing the vascular tissue. The pathogenicity mutant B 60 of the melon wilt pathogen F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis was isolated previously by restriction enzyme–mediated DNA integration mutagenesis. Molecular analysis of B 60 identified the affected gene, designated FOW 1, which encodes a protein with strong similarity to mitochondrial carrier proteins of yeast. Although the FOW 1 insertional mutant and gene-targeted mutants showed normal growth and conidiation in culture, they showed markedly reduced virulence as a result of a defect in the ability to colonize the plant tissue. Mitochondrial import of Fow 1 was verified using strains expressing the Fow 1 –green fluorescent protein fusion proteins. The FOW 1 -targeted mutants of the tomato wilt pathogen F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici also showed reduced virulence.

Oak trees, in response to wounding or infection often produce tyloses, balloon-like outgrowths of the vessels' cell walls that can function to wall-off pathogens and prevent infections from spreading. Red oaks appear to lack a host-response mechanism that restricts the pathogen's movement, and infection usually kills the tree by wilting the entire crown. White oaks, which produce tyloses more quickly and in greater numbers, are more resistant to the disease, though the exact mechanism for this resistance is unknown.|$|E

5000|$|In the spring, fruiting {{structures}} (acervuli) {{form from}} corn residue and produce spores (conidia) that are dispersed by wind blown raindrops and splashing. Conidial spores infect young plants through the epidermis or stomata. Anthracnose develops rapidly in cloudy, overcast conditions with high temperatures and humidity. In optimal environmental conditions, conidia can germinate {{in as little}} as 6-8 hours in 100% humidity. [...] Initial necrotic spots or lesions can be seen within 72 hours after infection by conidia. Lower leaves that develop lesions provide conidial spores and cause secondary infections on the upper leaves and stalk. Vascular infections primarily occur from wounds caused by stalk-boring insects, such as the larvae of the European corn borer, allowing for conidia to infect and colonize the xylem. From this, anthracnose top die back (<b>vascular</b> <b>wilt)</b> or stalk rot can occur. In the fall, C. graminicola survives as a saprophyte on corn leaf residue. The pathogen can also overwinter on corn stalks as conidia in an extracellular secretion. The secretion prevents conidia from desiccating and protects them from unfavorable environmental conditions. Overwintering on corn residue serves as a vital source of primary inoculum for the leaf blight phase in the spring. The cycle will start all over again when susceptible corn seedlings emerge from the ground in the spring.|$|E
5000|$|When {{roots of}} a host crop come near the resting {{structure}} (about 2mm), root exudate promotes germination and the fungi grows out of the structure and toward the plant. Being a <b>vascular</b> <b>wilt,</b> it {{will try to get}} to the vascular system {{on the inside of the}} plant, and therefore must enter the plant. Natural root wounds are the easiest way to enter, and these wounds occur naturally, even in healthy plants because of soil abrasion on roots. Verticillium has also been observed entering roots directly, but these infections rarely make it to the vascular system, especially those that enter through root hairs. Once the pathogen enters the host, it makes its way to the vascular system, and specifically the xylem. The fungi can spread as hyphae through the plant, but can also spread as spores. Verticillium produce conidia on conidiophores and once conidia are released in the xylem, they can quickly colonize the plant. Conidia have been observed traveling to the top of cotton plants, 115 cm, 24 hours after initial conidia inoculation, so the spread throughout the plant can occur very quickly. [...] Sometimes the flow of conidia will be stopped by cross sections of the xylem, and here the conidia will spawn, and the fungal hyphae can overcome the barrier, and then produce more conidia on the other side.|$|E

Grapevine (Vitis spp.) vascular diseases such as esca, botryosphaeria dieback, and eutypa dieback, are caused by a set of taxonomically unrelated ascomycete fungi. Fungal colonization of the vascular system leads to a decline of the plant host because of a loss of the xylem function and subsequent decrease in hydraulic conductivity. Fungal vascular pathogens use different colonization strategies to invade and kill their host. Vitis vinifera cultivars display different levels of tolerance towards vascular diseases caused by fungi, but the plant defense mechanisms underlying those observations have not been completely elucidated. In this review, we establish a parallel between two vascular diseases, grapevine esca disease and Dutch elm disease, and argue that the former should be viewed as a <b>vascular</b> <b>wilt</b> disease. Plant genotypes exhibit differences in xylem morphology and resistance to fungal pathogens causing <b>vascular</b> <b>wilt</b> diseases. We provide evidence that the susceptibility of three commercial V. vinifera cultivars to esca disease is correlated to large vessel diameter. Additionally, we explore how xylem morphological traits related to water transport are influenced by abiotic factors, and how these might impact host tolerance of <b>vascular</b> <b>wilt</b> fungi. Finally, we explore the utility of this concept for predicting which V. vinifera cultivars are most vulnerable of fungal <b>vascular</b> <b>wilt</b> diseases and propose new strategies for disease management...|$|E

The merits of role of actinomycetes in biological control of soil-borne fungal-pathogens are known, however actinomycetes micioflora of the Iranian soils has not been very well explored in searching for biofungicide agents.

Surveys of alfalfa production fields in Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Ontario in 2004, 2005, and 2007 indicate that the pathogen is widespread in eastern North America, often occurring at high incidence levels. Patterns of infected alfalfa within fields suggest that the pathogen was not recently introduced. Surveys of alfalfa production fields in Colorado, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania conducted in 2006 and 2007 suggest that central Pennsylvania and high mountain valleys at the latitude of northern New Mexico may delineate the southern extent of the distribution of P. sclerotioides within alfalfa production regions of eastern and western North America, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of multilocus sequence data places North American isolates of P. sclerotioides into multiple strongly supported clades, and morphological differences among isolates correspond to genetic differences.

Furthermore, we show that signaling components utilized by Ve 1 in Arabidopsis to establish Verticillium resistance overlap with those required in tomato and include SERK 3 /BAK 1, EDS 1, and NDR 1, which strongly suggests that critical components for resistance signaling are conserved. We subsequently investigated the requirement of SERK family members for Ve 1 resistance in Arabidopsis, revealing that SERK 1 is required in addition to SERK 3 /BAK 1.

We have previously reported the identification of four activation-tagged Arabidopsis mutants which showed enhanced resistance to Verticillium wilt. Among these, one mutant also showed enhanced resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum, a bacterial <b>vascular</b> <b>wilt</b> pathogen. Cloning of the activation tag revealed an insertion upstream of gene At 3 g 13437, which we designated as EWR 1 (for Enhancer of <b>vascular</b> <b>Wilt</b> Resistance 1) that encodes a putatively secreted protein of unknown function. The search for homologs of Arabidopsis EWR 1 (AtEWR 1) in public databases only identified homologs within the Brassicaceae family. We subsequently cloned the EWR 1 homolog from Brassica oleracea (BoEWR 1) and show that over-expression in Arabidopsis results in V. dahliae resistance. Moreover, over-expression of AtEWR 1 and BoEWR 1 in N. benthamiana, a member of the Solanaceae family, results in V. dahliae resistance, suggesting that EWR 1 homologs can be used to engineer Verticillium wilt resistance in non-Brassicaceae crops as well...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION The fungus Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid. causes {{charcoal}} rot in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). The fungus causes dark lesions on epicotyls and hypocotyls of seedlings and they die due to obstruction of the xylem vessels and <b>vascular</b> <b>wilting.</b> In adult plants, the pathogen causes yellowing of roots, the stems show dark longitudinal lesions {{and the plant}} was defoliated and withered. The {{charcoal rot}} is promoted by high temperatures and drought conditions, which are frequent in beans growing areas in Mexico. M. phaseolina {{is responsible for the}} 65 % on loss of bean yield (Abawi and Pastor-Corrales, 1990; Mayek-Perez et al., 1995;, Mayek-Perez et al., 1997). The study of genes differentially expressed in plants under M. phaseolina infection, will allow {{to gain a better understanding}} about plant defense mechanism. The objective of this study is the identification of P. vulgaris genes related to plant defense after fungal infection by subtractive hybridization (SSH) technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS The HMP 05 strain of M. phaseolina and Pinto UI- 114 P. vulgaris plants (susceptible variety to M. phaseolina) were grown in MS medium and incubated in a climate chamber at 25 º C with 16 -h light and 8 -h darkness period, during 5 and 15 days for the fungus and plantlets, respectively. For interaction assays, the plants were place on the mature mycelium and incubated in a climate chamber at same conditions of growth. After 48 h three replicates of the interaction samples, and the controls (only fungus and only plants without interaction) were collected. For expressed assays, RNA from interactions and control samples was extracted by TRIzol® (Invitrogen®) method. The SSH was performed with the PCR-Select™ cDNA Subtraction Kit as describe the manufacturer (637401, Clontech®). SSH library products were sent to Eurofins MWG Operon for sequencing. The expressed sequences tag (EST) obtained from the SSH were analyzed using Blastn and Blastx algorithms against the complete transcriptome of P. vulgaris (NCBI repository). Thereafter the ESTs corresponding with P. vulgaris genes that coding to hypothetic or unknown protein were analyzed using Blastp algorithm...|$|R

The soilborne {{pathogen}} Verticillium dahliae causes <b>vascular</b> <b>wilts</b> in a {{wide variety}} of crops. Isolates infecting olive can be classified into defoliating (D) or non-defoliating (ND). The spread of the D pathotype have greatly increased the impact of this disease on olive production. Fungal viruses (mycoviruses) from pathogenic species have potential as biocontrol agents as some reduce the virulence of their fungal host. The successful application of micoviruses to the control of fungi is dependent on their efficient transmission among isolates in natural fungal populations. Mycoviruses are thought to be transmitted horizontally mainly between somatically compatible isolates during hyphal anastomosis. In V. dahliae all D isolates belong to the same VCG while ND isolates conform different VCGs. In our aim to explore the potential of mycovirus to control Verticillium wilt, we have tested 200 isolates of V. dahliae from different areas of the Guadalquivir Valley and sampled in different years, revealing that only three exhibited viral infection. All three isolates harbored the same unclassified mycovirus with similarity to plant viruses of the family Tombusviridae which we designated VdUV 1. Intriguingly, the VdUV 1 -infected isolates did not belong to the same VCG; two were ND and one D. An analysis of VdUV 1 transmission by hyphal anastomosis using hygR-tagged D and ND recipient isolates showed that, as expected, it was readily transmitted among isolates of the same VCG while somatic incompatibility generally acted as a barrier for this transmission. However, we also found that the presence of “bridge” isolates can add complexity to this simple scenario. Thus, the two ND isolates transmitted VdUV 1 only to other compatible ND isolates. By contrast the VdUV 1 -infected D isolate transmitted it to both D and ND isolates, although with clearly different efficiencies, 100...|$|R
40|$|Aims] In this study, a loop-mediated {{isothermal}} amplification (LAMP) assay {{has been}} developed and evaluated for the rapid and sensitive detection of Verticillium dahliae Kleb., the causal agent of <b>vascular</b> <b>wilts</b> in many economically important crops. [Methods and Results] LAMP primers were designed based on a previously described RAPD marker, and the LAMP assay was applied for direct detection of V. dahliae grown on medium and from soil samples without DNA purification steps (direct-LAMP). Thirty-two agricultural soil samples from various olive orchards were collected, {{and the presence of}} pathogen was detected by LAMP, direct-LAMP and nested-PCR methods. The LAMP methodology could successfully detect V. dahliae with high specificity, and cross-reaction was not observed with different pathogenic and nonpathogenic fungi and bacteria. The LAMP assay was capable of detecting a minimum of 500 and 50 fg of purified target DNA per reaction of V. dahliae ND and D pathotypes, respectively. In contrast, nested-PCR could only detect 5 pg reaction- 1 for both pathotypes. In artificially infested soil samples, the LAMP method detected 5 microsclerotia per gram of soil. Conversely, nested-PCR assay detected 50 microsclerotia g- 1 soil. The detection ratios of LAMP and direct-LAMP protocols were better (26 and 24 positive samples out of 32 agricultural soils analysed, respectively) than that obtained for nested-PCR method (22 positive results). Moreover, direct-LAMP yielded positive detection of V. dahliae in agricultural soil samples within 60 - 80 min. [Conclusions] The newly developed LAMP method was proved to be an effective, simple and rapid method to detect V. dahliae without the need for either expensive equipment or DNA purification. [Significance and Impact of Study] This technique can be considered as an excellent standard alternative to plating and nested-PCR assays for the early, sensitive and low-cost detection of V. dahliae as well as other soilborne pathogens in the field. © 2013 The Society for Applied Microbiology.
