25|$|Today, the Port Aransas Ferry System {{provides}} free {{transportation service}} 24 hours a day, {{seven days a}} week. The service connects Mustang Island and Port Aransas with the mainland of Aransas Pass. The number of boats in service {{at any one time}} depends on demand. There are six boats that carry 20 regular passenger vehicles, and two new larger ferries that carry 28 passenger vehicles each trip. During peak hours, some travelers may need to wait while the ferry makes the trip across the channel. A 24-hour radio message (AM 530) provides information about ferry regulations and can be used for live broadcasts for emergency situations. A maximum vehicle height of 13 feet 6 inches is allowed. A maximum <b>vehicle</b> <b>width</b> of 96 inches is allowed. The maximum weight limit is 80,000 pounds. Peak months include June, July, and August. The ferry system is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation.|$|E
2500|$|The Mount Keira Ring Track {{provides}} walkers with {{a moderate}} [...] (3–5-hour) round trip. The Ring Track encircles the mountain {{at an average}} height of 250 metres. The walk can be commenced {{from a number of}} locations, including Mount Keira summit, Byarong Park, the Scout Camp and Queen Elizabeth Drive. The Ring Track can also be joined from the Mount Pleasant Track, which starts from Parrish Avenue. From Byarong Park, a picnic area with parking and an information bay, access to the Ring Track is via a short link track that runs from the northern perimeter of the picnic area to the entrance of the Girl Guide Camp road. The link track crosses the Guide Camp road and then ascends a short distance through rainforest, before joining the Ring Track. From the junction, two branches of the Ring Track ascend the mountain. The left branch gently climbs the southern flank of Mount Keira, following Mitchells Road to a saddle located at the junction of Mount Keira Road and Queen Elizabeth Drive. The right branch traverses the mountain's eastern flank, before emerging at Geordies Flat on Mount Keira Road. From Geordies Flat, the northern branch of the Ring Track climbs steadily to the junction of Mount Keira Road and Queen Elizabeth Drive. At this point, walkers can also join the Robertsons Lookout track, a short [...] walk that terminates at a spectacular view that takes in the Scout Camp, Mount Keira and the Illawarra coast.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{takes the}} parking vehicle {{out of the}} off-street parking access in the city as the {{research}} object, analyzes the main influence factors of the vehicle {{in the process of}} entering in the parking lot, and the crossing time is defined as the cross through the waiting time and travel time. By the way of theoretical analysis and field investigation, we present one calculation model through the waiting time while another through the travel time, and verify the analysis. Based on the measured data about parking entering rate, we conducted a sensitivity analysis the combination conditions of different non-motorized <b>vehicle</b> lane <b>width</b> and flow, the main conclusions are as follow: First of all, compared with the non-motorized <b>vehicle</b> lane <b>width,</b> the impact of non-motorized vehicle flow on crossing time is more obvious; Secondly, in the same flow conditions, changes of crossing time and non-motorized <b>vehicle</b> lane <b>width</b> is inversely proportional to the <b>width</b> of non-motorized <b>vehicle</b> lane; Thirdly, when less than 5 meters, crossing time changed significantly affected by it; finally, when the non-motorized <b>vehicle</b> lane <b>width</b> is greater than 6 meters, crossing time had small changes affected by it...|$|R

The total vehicle mass is approximately 332 kg (excluding driver and bodywork); with a 75 kg driver the static weight distribution is 39% front and 61% rear. The rear module does not tilt and accounts for approximately 40% of the laden vehicle mass meaning only 60% can be tilted {{to balance the}} vehicle whilst cornering. CLEVER’s wheelbase is 2.4m, as long as many conventional city cars, {{but there are no}} overhangs so total length is under 3m.

5000|$|Opened on June 1, 1997, the Ringlijn (Ring Line or Circle Line) {{is entirely}} built on {{embankments}} and viaducts, {{and has no}} level crossings. The line was initially for political reasons called [...] "express circle tram", but since {{the opening of the}} Ring Line the transit service on the line is referred to as a Metro Route 50 (Gein - Isolatorweg).

The new [...] "trams" [...] (Series M4 / S3) have retractable running boards to bridge the space between the vehicle and the platform at existing stations. Since Route 50 proved hugely popular, the express tram vehicles were insufficient to handle the number of passengers. Instead of ordering additional vehicles, in 2000 the city of Amsterdam decided to adjust the platforms at the stations between Amstelveenseweg and Isolatorweg, whereby the older rolling stock (M1, M2 and M3) serving on the East Line could also serve on the Ring Line.
