5|$|Kennedy's staff drew up {{detailed}} {{plans for}} a candidacy in the 1984 presidential election that he considered, but with his family opposed and his realization that the Senate was a fully satisfying career, in late 1982 {{he decided not to}} run.

5|$|During the 1892 presidential campaign, {{there was}} talk of Russell being the <b>Vice</b> <b>Presidential</b> <b>nominee</b> if Senator John M. Palmer were to receive the Democratic Presidential nomination. In early February 1892, Palmer and Patrick A. Collins, a former Democratic Massachusetts Congressman, agreed to make Palmer the Democratic Presidential {{candidate}} and Russell, Collins' personal and political friend, the Vice Presidential candidate. Palmer ended up rejecting the bid, and argued against it at the 1892 Democratic National Convention. Russell received one vote for President on the first ballot.|$|E
5|$|At the 1848 Whig National Convention, Taylor {{defeated}} Henry Clay and Winfield Scott {{to receive}} the Whig nomination for President. For his <b>Vice</b> <b>Presidential</b> <b>nominee</b> the convention chose Millard Fillmore, a prominent New York Whig who had chaired the House Ways and Means Committee and had been a contender for Clay's <b>Vice</b> <b>Presidential</b> <b>nominee</b> in the 1844 election. Fillmore's selection was largely an attempt at reconciliation with northern Whigs, who were furious at the nomination of a slaveowning southerner; all factions of the party were dissatisfied with the final ticket. Taylor continued to minimize {{his role in the}} campaign, preferring not to directly meet with voters or correspond regarding his political views. His campaign was skillfully directed by Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky, a friend and early political supporter, and bolstered by a late endorsement from Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts. Taylor defeated Lewis Cass, the Democratic candidate, and Martin Van Buren, the Free Soil candidate, taking 163 of the 290 electoral votes. In the popular vote, he took 47.3%, while Cass won 42.5% and Van Buren won 10.1%. Taylor would be the last Whig to be elected president and the last person elected to the U.S. presidency from neither the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, as well as the last Southerner to win a presidential election until Woodrow Wilson's election in 1912.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, Roosevelt, on Howe's advice, {{had made}} peace with Tammany boss Charles Murphy, and again sought New York state office.

Roosevelt selected Howe as his campaign manager. The CoxRoosevelt ticket lost overwhelmingly to Republicans Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge, but both Roosevelt and Howe saw themselves as having successfully built Roosevelt a national reputation; {{not long after the}} election, Howe boasted to several friends that Roosevelt would soon occupy the White House, taking Howe with him.|$|E

50|$|In 1960, Daniel won renomination over Jack Cox, an oil {{equipment}} executive from Houston. Daniel then {{prevailed in}} the general election by a much larger margin than that obtained by John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B.

Steger of Tyler, who obtained 612,963 ballots (27.2 percent). Yet Kennedy and Johnson barely won the Texas electoral votes over Richard Nixon.|$|R
5|$|William Daniel (January 24, 1826 – October 13, 1897) was an American {{politician}} {{from the}} state of Maryland. A lawyer, he was a noted prohibitionist and abolitionist. He served in both houses of the Maryland state legislature, first as a Whig, and later {{as a member of the}} American Party. Later, as a Republican, he was a member of the convention that wrote Maryland's constitution in 1864. He helped found the Maryland Temperance Alliance in 1872 and served as its president for twelve years. Daniel was the <b>vice</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominee</b> and running mate of John St. John on the Prohibition Party ticket in the presidential election of 1884. Placing third in the election that year, he continued his involvement with the cause of temperance until his death in 1897.|$|E
5|$|William H. West of Ohio {{nominated}} Blaine with {{an enthusiastic}} speech {{and after the}} first ballot, Blaine led the count with 334½ votes. While short of the necessary 417 for nomination, Blaine had far {{more than any other}} candidate with Arthur in second place at 278 votes. Blaine was unacceptable to the Arthur delegates just as Blaine’s own delegates would never vote for the President, so the contest was between the two for the delegates of the remaining candidates. Blaine’s total steadily increased as Logan and Sherman withdrew in his favor and some of the Edmunds delegates defected to him. Unlike in previous conventions, the momentum for Blaine in 1884 would not be halted. On the fourth ballot, Blaine received 541 votes and was, at last, nominated. Logan was named <b>vice</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominee</b> on the first ballot, and the Republicans had their ticket.|$|E
5|$|At the 1920 Republican National Convention, most of {{the delegates}} were {{selected}} by state party conventions, not primaries. As such, the field was divided among many local favorites. Coolidge was one such candidate, and while he placed as high as sixth in the voting, the powerful party bosses running the convention, primarily the party's U.S. Senators, never considered him seriously. After ten ballots, the bosses and then the delegates settled on Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio as their nominee for president. When {{the time came to}} select a <b>vice</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominee,</b> the bosses also made and announced their decision on whom they wanted – Sen. Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin – and then prematurely departed after his name was put forth, relying on the rank and file to confirm their decision. A delegate from Oregon, Wallace McCamant, having read Have Faith in Massachusetts, proposed Coolidge for vice president instead. The suggestion caught on quickly with the masses starving for an act of independence from the absent bosses, and Coolidge was unexpectedly nominated.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2012, Fortuño {{endorsed}} former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney {{for president}} during {{an event in}} Miami, Florida, and on April 5 Romney spoke highly of Fortuño {{when asked if he}} had a list of potential <b>vice</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominees,</b> stating that Puerto Rico's governor is “a solid conservative and a firm leader”... "and he certainly qualifies {{as one of the great}} leaders of our party". He was included in an occasional <b>vice</b> <b>presidential</b> [...] "short list". In August 2012, Politico reported that Fortuño [...] "is liked and trusted in the Romney campaign" [...] and [...] "Commerce or Interior are possibilities" [...] for Fortuño in a potential Romney cabinet.|$|R
50|$|Before Harding was nominated, Johnson, Kansas Governor Henry Justin Allen, Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, Wisconsin Senator Irvine Lenroot, Kentucky Governor Edwin P. Morrow, and Harding himself {{were all}} seen as {{possible}} <b>vice</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominees.</b> Once the <b>presidential</b> nomination was finally settled, Harding {{and the party}} bosses asked Johnson to join the ticket as a progressive balance to Harding. When Johnson turned down the offer, they approached Lenroot, who accepted. However, when Illinois Senator Medill McCormick stood up to nominate Lenroot, several delegates began to shout for Coolidge. A groundswell of support built up for Coolidge, who won the nomination over Lenroot. Coolidge, who {{was not at the}} convention during the <b>vice</b> <b>presidential</b> nomination, agreed to join the ticket.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the vice}} {{president}} {{does not need to}} have any political experience, most major-party <b>vice</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominees</b> are current or former United States Senators or Representatives, with the occasional nominee being a current or former Governor, a high-ranking military officer, or a holder of a major post within the Executive Department. The <b>vice</b> <b>presidential</b> candidates of the major national political parties are formally selected by each party's quadrennial nominating convention, following the selection of the party's presidential candidates. The official process is identical to the one by which the presidential candidates are chosen, with delegates placing the names of candidates into nomination, followed by a ballot in which candidates must receive a majority to secure the party's nomination.|$|R
5|$|Along {{with the}} speaker series, Lindenwood has hosted various {{speakers}} and political candidates throughout its history. Robert A.

John Danforth, in 1970 during his campaign for the US Senate seat representing Missouri. Leonor K. Sullivan, visited Lindenwood in 1973 as the first woman in Congress from Missouri. John Ashcroft made a stop at Lindenwood in 1983 as a campaign stop before he became Missouri's Governor in 1984. Richard Gephardt spoke in 1985 as a U.S. Representative of Missouri.

The delegates {{selected}} the Republican <b>presidential</b> and <b>vice</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominees</b> {{and wrote the}} party platform. A simple majority of 1,237 delegates was needed to win the presidential nomination. Following Trump's decisive win in Indiana and the subsequent suspension of the Cruz and Kasich campaigns, not to mention Trump reaching the threshold following his decisive win in Washington state, {{it became clear that}} there would not be a contested convention in Cleveland. On the first ballot, Trump clinched the nomination with 1,725 delegates, 488 more than required.|$|R
50|$|Clark and Bryan {{were both}} {{proposed}} as <b>vice</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominees,</b> but both declined, with Clark preferring {{to remain as}} Speaker and Bryan fearful of overshadowing Wilson. Bryan instead proposed Oregon Senator George E. Chamberlain and North Dakota Governor John Burke, the latter of whom became the main progressive candidate. Governor Thomas R. Marshall of Indiana, who had swung his state's delegate votes to Wilson in later ballots, became the major candidate of conservatives. After the second ballot, Congressman William Hughes, a leading campaign manager of Wilson's, successfully proposed making the nomination of Marshall unanimous. Wilson and Marshall {{went on to win}} a landslide victory in the 1912 Presidential election against a split Republican Party.|$|R
25|$|Webb was {{frequently}} {{mentioned as a}} possible <b>vice</b> <b>presidential</b> Democratic <b>nominee</b> for Barack Obama in 2008 due to his military experience and moderate policy positions.

25|$|At the 1924 Republican National Convention, President Calvin Coolidge {{was quickly}} {{selected}} almost without opposition {{to be the}} Republican presidential nominee. The <b>vice</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominee</b> was more contested. Illinois Governor Frank Lowden was nominated, but declined. Coolidge's next choice was Idaho Senator William Borah, but he also declined the nomination. The Republican National Chairman, William Butler, pledged to nominate then Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover, {{but he was not}} sufficiently popular. Eventually, the delegates chose Dawes to be the <b>vice</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominee.</b> Coolidge quickly accepted the delegates' choice and felt that Dawes would be loyal to him and make a strong addition to his campaign.|$|E

5|$|On August 29, 2008, McCain {{revealed}} Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as {{his surprise}} choice for running mate. McCain {{was only the}} second U.S. major-party <b>presidential</b> <b>nominee</b> (after Walter Mondale) to select a woman for his running mate and the first Republican to do so; Palin would have become the first female Vice President of the United States if McCain had been elected. On September 3, 2008, McCain and Palin became the Republican Party's <b>presidential</b> and <b>vice</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominees,</b> respectively, at the 2008 Republican National Convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota. McCain surged ahead of Obama in national polls following the convention, as the Palin pick energized core Republican voters who had previously been wary of him. However, by the campaign's own later admission, the rollout of Palin to the national media went poorly, and voter reactions to Palin grew increasingly negative, especially among independents and other voters concerned about her qualifications.|$|R
50|$|In July 2000, Danforth's {{name was}} leaked as {{being on the}} short list of {{potential}} <b>vice</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nominees</b> for Republican candidate George W.

Just one week before the 2000 Republican National Convention was to be held in Philadelphia, campaign sources said that Dick Cheney, the man charged with leading the selection process for the nominee, had recommended Danforth to Bush for the position. However, despite growing speculation that Danforth was Bush's final pick, Bush selected Cheney himself for the position. Bush wrote in his autobiography Decision Points that Danforth would have been his choice if Cheney did not accept.|$|R
