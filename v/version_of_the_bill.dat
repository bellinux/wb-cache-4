5|$|In 2012, Gillibrand {{authored}} {{a portion}} of the STOCK Act, which extended limitations on insider trading by members of Congress. A <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> merged by Senator Joe Lieberman with content from another bill authored by Senator Scott Brown, was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama in April.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs {{was also}} viewed {{as one of}} the crucial swing votes on a measure to repeal the death penalty in Colorado and use the {{resulting}} savings to fund a statewide cold case unit. Although he first voted to remove the death penalty repeal from the legislation, he later voted in support of a <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> containing the repeal, which came within one vote of passing the legislature {{on the final day of}} the session.|$|E
5|$|May 4, 2017, the United States House of Representatives {{voted to}} pass the American Health Care Act (and thereby repeal most of the Affordable Care Act) by a narrow margin of 217 to 213, sending the bill to the Senate for deliberation. The Senate Republican {{leadership}} announced that Senate Republicans would write their own <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> instead of voting on the House version.|$|E
50|$|Earlier <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> were {{introduced}} in 1989 and 1993.|$|R
50|$|Many {{state legislatures}} have {{considered}} their own <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b>|$|R
50|$|Previous <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> were {{introduced}} in the 108th, 109th, 110th, and 111th Congresses. In each case, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> never {{made it out of}} committee.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> {{introduced in}} the House of Representatives on February 16, 1925 by Pennsylvania Congressman George P. Darrow and in the Senate by that state's George W. Pepper, called for a $1.50 gold coin for the 150th anniversary, for commemorative half dollars, and for a $1 bill honoring the Declaration of Independence. A hearing was held before the House Committee on Industrial Arts and Expositions two days later, at which Congressman Darrow predicted that the $1.50 gold pieces would not be opposed by either the Treasury or the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, but he was incorrect; Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon would not support them. The Commission also hoped to have commemoratives depicting the enlargement of the country through acquisitions such as the Louisiana Purchase and the Annexation of Texas, but these {{were not included in}} the final <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> Nevertheless, the Commission continued to pursue congressional approval of the $1.50 piece and the other proposed commemoratives at least through August 1925.|$|E
5|$|After the Committee's {{first and}} second reports were considered, the Lords passed the bill 221 to 81 on 26 October 1999. During the session, Earl of Burford, son of the Duke of St Albans, {{launched}} a protest at the constitutional implications of the bill from the Woolsack, and was ejected from the chamber. Once the Lords settled the differences between their <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> and the Commons version thereof, the Bill received Royal Assent on 11 November 1999 and became an Act of parliament. The Act then came into force the same day.|$|E
5|$|Desha {{gradually}} became more conservative {{after his return}} to the House, consistently resisting expansion of the U.S. Navy. He also opposed Secretary of War James Monroe's request to maintain a standing peacetime army of 20,000 men. Desha argued that a large standing army provided the advocates of a larger federal government with an excuse to increase taxes, and proposed that the standing army should consist of only 6,000 men. A coalition of Federalists and conservative Democratic-Republicans in the House united to adopt Desha's suggestion by a vote of 7565. The <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> passed by the Senate, however, required a standing army of 15,000 men. The legislation was referred to a conference committee, which ultimately adopted a compromise of 10,000 men.|$|E

50|$|Previous <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> were {{introduced}} in the Republican-controlled 106th, 107th, 108th, and 109th Congresses. In each case, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> never {{made it out of}} committee.|$|R
50|$|On June 14, 2016, the Senate {{voted to}} require women to {{register}} for the draft, though language requiring this was dropped from later <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b>|$|R
5|$|Finally in 1909, Stanley {{attached}} {{his proposed}} {{repeal of the}} tobacco tax as a rider to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act. The bill passed the House, but the Senate stripped Stanley's provision. Kentucky Senator Ollie M. James reintroduced the repeal into the Senate <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> and it survived when the bill was passed into law. The repeal resulted in higher tobacco prices, and although Stanley had not been alone in getting the repeal passed, he received much of the credit. In 1911, Stanley's fight against the American Tobacco Company bore fruit, as the Supreme Court ruled the company to be in violation of antitrust laws and broke it into separate companies. Both the tax repeal and the breakup of American Tobacco helped quell the violence perpetrated by the Night Riders.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Marriage Protection Act was reintroduced to the General Assembly on January 23, 2012. The new <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> {{contained}} {{provisions that}} more explicitly protects religious leaders, institutions, and their programs from legal action if {{they refuse to}} officiate or provide facilities for a same-sex marriage or couple {{as a matter of}} their doctrine. During the legislative process, several high-profile political figures attempted to persuade legislators to vote in favor of the bill, including former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Dick Cheney, Terry McAuliffe, and Ken Mehlman. The House of Delegates passed the bill with a 72–67 vote on February 17, 2012 and the Senate passed with a 25–22 vote on February 23, 2012. To secure support from some lawmakers who desired to submit the law to public referendum, the bill was amended to take effect on January 1, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the end of}} the legislative session, Beshear called for a special legislative session to consider a way to meet the state's Medicaid obligations and whether or not to raise the minimum dropout age. In the special session, legislators also approved raising the minimum dropout age to 18 during the special session. Following the session, the National Education Association honored Beshear with its America's Greatest Education Governor Award for 2011, citing his advocacy for raising the minimum dropout age and his consistent refusal to cut education funding. Both houses also approved a plan that allowed Beshear to move the funds from the second year of the budget, but triggered automatic spending cuts if the managed care plans did not generate sufficient savings. The bill also called for the hiring of an independent accounting firm to assess the savings achieved by the managed care plans. Beshear then used his line-item veto to strike the spending cuts and the savings assessment provisions, per a previous arrangement with Democratic lawmakers. By eliminating these provisions, the <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> signed by Beshear was essentially the plan he had proposed during the regular session. The House adjourned the session March 24, but the Senate remained in session until April 6, voting to override Beshear's vetoes, but without concurrence from the House, the override votes were ineffective.|$|E
50|$|June 30, 2010: Deadline for House and Senate to {{reconcile}} <b>the</b> two <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> This deadline passed without reconciliation and <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> failed to become law.|$|R

50|$|In 2011, New York state Gov. Andrew Cuomo vetoed {{a bill to}} {{establish}} a formal War Of 1812 Bicentennial Commission. Previous <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> were vetoed repeatedly by Gov. David Paterson in 2009 and 2010.|$|R
5|$|The {{chambers}} {{appointed a}} conference committee to resolve {{differences between the}} House and Senate versions of the bill. A major contention concerned the poll tax provisions; the Senate version allowed the Attorney General to sue states that used poll taxes to discriminate, while the House version outright banned all poll taxes. Initially, the committee members were stalemated. To help broker a compromise, Attorney General Katzenbach drafted legislative language explicitly asserting that poll taxes were unconstitutional and instructed the Department of Justice to sue the states that maintained poll taxes. To assuage concerns of liberal committee members that this provision was not strong enough, Katzenbach {{enlisted the help of}} Martin Luther King, Jr., who gave his support to the compromise. King's endorsement ended the stalemate, and on July 29, the conference committee reported its version out of committee. The House approved this conference report <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> on August 3 by a 328-74 vote (Democrats 217-54, Republicans 111-20), and the Senate passed it on August 4 by a 79-18 vote (Democrats 49-17, Republicans 30-1). On August 6, President Johnson signed the Act into law with King, Rosa Parks, John Lewis, and other civil rights leaders in attendance at the signing ceremony.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, the National Council on Disability had {{recommended}} enactment of an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and drafted the first <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> which {{was introduced in}} the House and Senate in 1988. The final <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> was signed into law on July 26, 1990, by President George H. W. Bush. It was later amended in 2008 and signed by President George W.

25|$|The Filipino Veterans Fairness Act is {{the name}} of a number of acts that have been {{introduced}} to the United States Congress in both the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate since the 103rd Congress in 1993. Since then, nearly every session of Congress has seen a new <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> introduced. The purpose of these bills is to amend Title 38 of the United States Code to grant citizenship to Filipinos who have completed an enlistment in the American Armed Forces; at least some versions of this bill would grant citizenship to other foreign nationals under the same provisions. Currently, every <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> introduced has died in committee. Despite this, the bill has been re-introduced in nearly every session of Congress since 1993.|$|E
