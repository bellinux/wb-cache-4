The goal of these programmes is to enable the public, especially young people, to become engaged in and understand the field of particle physics through direct dialogue between ATLAS/CMS scientists and remote audiences. ATLAS and CMS collaborations enhanced the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Visits</b> concept in different ways, but still with the same objective, which is to break down geographical barriers and allow more people to enter the world of science, physics and particle physics.

IMPORTANCE Commercial virtual visits are an {{increasingly}} popular model {{of health care}} for the management of common acute illnesses. In commercial virtual visits, patients access a website to be connected synchronously-via videoconference, telephone, or webchat-to a physician with whom they have no prior relationship. To date, whether the care delivered through those websites is similar or quality varies among the sites has not been assessed. OBJECTIVE To assess the variation in the quality of urgent health care among <b>virtual</b> <b>visit</b> companies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This audit study used 67 trained standardized patients who presented to commercial <b>virtual</b> <b>visit</b> companies with the following 6 common acute illnesses: Ankle pain, streptococcal pharyngitis, viral pharyngitis, acute rhinosinusitis, low back pain, and recurrent female urinary tract infection. The 8 commercial <b>virtual</b> <b>visit</b> websites with the highest web traffic were selected for audit, for a total of 599 visits. Data were collected from May 1, 2013, to July 30, 2014, and analyzed from July 1, 2014, to September 1, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Completeness of histories and physical examinations, the correct diagnosis (vs an incorrect or no diagnosis), and adherence to guidelines of key management decisions. RESULTS Sixty-seven standardized patients completed 599 commercial virtual visits during the study period. Histories and physical examinations were complete in 417 visits (69. 6 %; 95 %CI, 67. 7 %- 71. 6 %); diagnoses were correctly named in 458 visits (76. 5 %; 95 %CI, 72. 9 %- 79. 9 %), and key management decisions were adherent to guidelines in 325 visits (54. 3 %; 95 %CI, 50. 2 %- 58. 3 %). Rates of guideline- Adherent care ranged from 206 visits (34. 4 %) to 396 visits (66. 1 %) across the 8 websites. Variation across websites was significantly greater for viral pharyngitis and acute rhinosinusitis (adjusted rates, 12. 8 %to 82. 1 %) than for streptococcal pharyngitis and low back pain (adjusted rates, 74. 6 %to 96. 5 %) or ankle pain and recurrent urinary tract infection (adjusted rates, 3. 4 %to 40. 4 %). No statistically significant variation in guideline adherence by mode of communication (videoconference vs telephone vs webchat) was found. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Significant variation in quality was found among companies providing virtual visits for management of common acute illnesses. More variation was found in performance for some conditions than for others, but no variation by mode of communication...|$|E
40|$|Valid and {{relevant}} statistics {{are required for}} library planning and advocacy. As libraries and their users turn to the web, library statistics must follow.

40|$|The <b>virtual</b> <b>visits</b> {{exist for}} several years and rest on open source or {{professional}} software packages allowing to realize complete animations. The historic buildings are often fragile, sometimes difficultly and only partially accessible. It is the complex case of the building of the municipal baths of Strasbourg, France, object of this study. It is thus interesting to use the technologies of the <b>virtual</b> <b>visits</b> to document a historic building. If we content ourselves only of panoramic images, the visitor cannot take completely advantage of the site, especially if he does not know it in advance. It is a question of proposing to the visitor a guided tour, constrained, allowing him to move on to all the recommended places. Then to supply him further information on the most significant parts and to propose him images of archive to make comparisons. Of course, if he wants to walk alone in and around the building, he will have the leisure of it, but at his own risk. To realize such a visit, the paper shows the various necessary stages of elaboration, in particular by beginning with the writing of a scenario of the visit.

40|$|Advances in {{technology}} {{are likely to}} provide new approaches to address healthcare disparities for high-risk populations. This study explores the feasibility of {{a new approach to}} health disparities research using a multidisciplinary intervention and advanced communication technology to improve patient access to care and chronic disease management. A high-risk cohort of uninsured, poorly-controlled diabetic patients was identified then randomized pre-consent with stratification by geographic region to receive either the intervention or usual care. Prior to enrollment, participants were screened for readiness to make a behavioral change. The primary outcome was the feasibility of protocol implementation, and secondary outcomes included the use of patient-centered medical home (PCMH) services and markers of chronic disease control. The intervention included a standardized needs assessment, individualized care plan, intensive management by a multidisciplinary team, including health coach-facilitated <b>virtual</b> <b>visits,</b> and the use of a cloud-based glucose monitoring system. One-hundred twenty-seven high-risk, potentially eligible participants were randomized. Sixty-one met eligibility criteria after an in-depth review. Due to limited resources and time for the pilot, we only attempted to contact 36 participants. Of these, we successfully reached 20 (32 %) by phone and conducted a readiness to change screen. Ten participants screened in as ready to change and were enrolled, while the remaining 10 were not ready to change. Eight enrolled participants completed the final three-month follow-up. Intervention feasibility was demonstrated through successful implementation of 13 out of 14 health coach-facilitated <b>virtual</b> <b>visits,</b> and 100 % of participants indicated that they would recommend the intervention to a friend. Protocol feasibility was demonstrated as eight of 10 participants completed the entire study protocol. At the end of the three-month intervention, participants had a median of nine total documented contacts with PCMH providers compared to four in the control group. Three intervention and two control participants had controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A 1 C < 9 %). Multidisciplinary care that utilizes health coach-facilitated <b>virtual</b> <b>visits</b> is an intervention that could increase access to intensive primary care services in a vulnerable population. The methods tested are feasible and should be tested in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact on patient-relevant outcomes across multiple chronic diseases...|$|R
