40|$|The <b>virtual</b> <b>fields</b> method (VFM) is an {{approach}} to inversely identify material parameters using full-field deformation data. In this manuscript, {{a new set of}} automatically-defined <b>virtual</b> <b>fields</b> for non- linear constitutive models has been proposed. These new sensitivity-based <b>virtual</b> <b>fields</b> reduce the influence of noise on the parameter identification. The sensitivity-based <b>virtual</b> <b>fields</b> were applied to a numerical example involving small strain plasticity; however, the general formulation derived for these <b>virtual</b> <b>fields</b> is applicable to any non-linear constitutive model. To quantify the improvement offered by these new <b>virtual</b> <b>fields,</b> they were compared with stiffness-based and manually defined <b>virtual</b> <b>fields.</b> The proposed sensitivity-based <b>virtual</b> <b>fields</b> were consistently able to identify plastic model parameters and outperform the stiffness-based and manually defined <b>virtual</b> <b>fields</b> when the data was corrupted by noise. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The <b>virtual</b> <b>fields</b> method (VFM) is a {{powerful}} technique for determining stiffness distributions of a sample, based on measured full-field strain data. The advantage of the VFM over many other methods {{is its ability to}} solve inverse problems of this type without any iteration. A key step in any application of the VFM is the selection of the <b>virtual</b> <b>fields.</b> Several techniques are based on the use of polynomials of spatial variables (either on the whole domain or in a piecewise form), and the material properties are considered as having single values (homogeneous) within the domain. The first attempt to parameterise the material properties as a function of spatial variables was proposed in for reconstruction of the stiffness map of a plate with impact damage. In this paper, we retain the basic concepts underlying the VFM but approach the parameterisation of the material properties in the spatial frequency, rather than spatial, domain by performing a 3 -D Fourier series expansion of the stiffness distribution over the region of interest. Furthermore, the <b>virtual</b> <b>fields</b> are not selected as polynomials of spatial variables as in the previous VFM literature, but from a set of simple cosine or sine functions of different spatial frequencies. The abbreviation F-VFM will be used to denote the VFM in which both a Fourier series is used for the material property parameterization, and cosine/sine functions for the <b>virtual</b> <b>fields.</b> The F-VFM was developed originally for 2 -D geometries; here it is extended to volumetric datasets resulting, for example, from measurements with Digital Volume Correlation or Phase Contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, several {{approaches}} {{available in}} the literature for identifying the constitutive parameters of linear elastic materials from full-field measurements are presented and their sensitivity to a white noise added to the data is compared. The first investigated approach is the <b>virtual</b> <b>fields</b> method (VFM). It is shown that {{the uncertainty of the}} parameters identified with the VFM when a white noise is added to the data depends on the choice of a relevant set of <b>virtual</b> <b>fields.</b> Optimal <b>virtual</b> <b>fields</b> exist, thus minimizing the uncertainty and providing the “maximum likelihood solution”. The other approaches investigated in this paper are based on finite element model updating (FEMU). It is proved that FEMU approaches actually yield equations similar to the ones derived from the VFM, but with nonoptimal sets of <b>virtual</b> <b>fields.</b> Therefore, the FEMU approaches do not provide the “maximum likelihood solution”. However, the uncertainty of FEMU approaches varies dramatically with the cost function to minimize. On one hand, the FEMU approach based on the “displacement gap” minimization yields equations which are very close to the ones of the VFM approach and therefore, its uncertainty is almost the same as the VFM one. On the other hand, it is shown that other approaches based on the “constitutive equation gap” minimization or the “equilibrium gap” minimization provide biased solutions. For all the approaches, very fast algorithms, converging in only two iterations, have been devised. They are finally applied to real experimental data obtained on an orthotropic composite material. Results confirm the success of two methods: the VFM approach which provides the “maximum likelihood solution” and the FEMU approach based on the “displacement gap” minimization...|$|R
