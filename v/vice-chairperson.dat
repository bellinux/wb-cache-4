However, their application for membership was rejected. According to the current chairperson Cyd Ho, some senior members [...] "succeeded in sticking to the Monitor's regulations" [...] and claimed that those tens of people could not join the Monitor because they had not elaborately communicated with the Director Mr Law. Consequently, that member [...] "with different concept" [...] also left the Monitor. [...] Those “regulations” can neither be found in the Monitor’s homepage nor their membership application form. According to the Monitor’s homepage, to join the Monitor, a person needs only to pay $100 and complete the application form. Besides, “the one essential qualification for membership is a genuine commitment to human rights and the rule of law” and “members... are free to take as much or as little part in the Monitor's activities”.
