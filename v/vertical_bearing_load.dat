30|$|Compressive {{strength}} of cross-laminated timber (CLT) {{is one of}} the important mechanical properties which should be considered especially in design of mid-rise CLT building because it works to resist a <b>vertical</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>load</b> from the upper storeys. The CLT panel can be manufactured in various combinations of the grade and dimension of lamina. This leads to the fact that an experimental approach to evaluate the {{strength of}} CLT would be expensive and time-demanding. In this paper, lamina property-based models for predicting the compressive strength of CLT panel was studied. A Monte Carlo simulation was applied for the model prediction. A set of experimental compression tests on CLT panel (short column) was conducted to validate the model and it shows good results. Using this model, the influence of the lamina’s width on the CLT compressive strength was investigated. It reveals that the CLT compressive strength increases with {{the increase in the number}} of lamina. It was thought that repetitive member effect (or dispersion effect) is applicable for the CLT panel, which was explained by the decrease of the variation in strength. This dependency of the number of lamina needs further study in development of reference design values, CLT wall design and CLT manufacturing.|$|E
40|$|The design {{reliability}} of the theory applied when calculating the sensitivity of shafting alignment must be determined especially at the initial design stage of shafting arrangement and calculation for the <b>vertical</b> static <b>bearing</b> <b>loads</b> (reaction forces) and pressures {{in order to obtain}} positive uniform values, which have to comply with the design requirements of the High Speed Craft Code of Classification Society. Any poor design of shafting arrangement for each <b>vertical</b> static <b>bearing</b> location and/or bearing off-set design value may cause a failed shafting alignment calculation and a non-uniform <b>bearing</b> <b>load</b> or over excessive <b>bearing</b> <b>load</b> and pressure on the propulsion shaft stern tube/strut supporting bearing and possible further damage, for example, excessive wastage and/or crack on a damaged aft shaft strut bearing for a high speed craft. The objective {{of this study was to}} find and verify the design {{reliability of}} the applied theoretical method for calculating the suitable design values of each <b>vertical</b> static <b>bearing</b> <b>load</b> and pressure on the propulsion shafting system at the initial design stage of shafting arrangement. The design values for each <b>vertical</b> static <b>bearing</b> <b>load</b> and pressure calculated by theoretical design methodologies of the finite element method (FEM) and the three moment equation method (TMEM) were compared with the shipyard original design values for the same design case of propulsion shafting system. The design deviation of the <b>vertical</b> static <b>bearing</b> from the shipyard original design values was determined in order to decide which design methodology (TMEM or FEM) would be adopted and developed for further numerical algorithm design on shafting alignment optimization. According to the obtained results, both the FEM and the TMEM theoretical design accuracy and reliability were well matched with the shipyard original design values. In addition, the TMEM design results for each static <b>bearing</b> <b>load</b> and pressure proved to be more close to the shipyard original design values...|$|R

The <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> structure is made of reinforced concrete, based on strip and isolated foundation footings, slabs, columns and walls. It is analysed with the programme Tower 7, which utilises the final elements method. Two computational models of the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> structure are built. The first one is used to analyse the typical ceiling construction in the building. Besides the slab, we also include some <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> elements {{above and below the}} slab into the model. To analyse the <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> elements we create a more complex three-dimensional computational model of the whole <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> construction. The ceiling slab analysis takes into account both the dead load as well as the live load. The analysis of the whole <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> structure also includes snow load and the horizontal effects of wind and earthquake. The dynamic effect is determined by the means of a linear modal analysis with a response spectrum. The core of the thesis is represented in the analysis and the dimensioning of typical <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> elements in the building. Firstly, dimensioning of the lower and upper reinforcement is executed. The calculation results are compared to the amount of built-in reinforcement, information about which is gathered from the original project documentation that followed the old PBAB regulation. Next, is the dimensioning of wall AB and column AB. The reinforcement for both is constructed in accordance with ductile behaviour requirements.

40|$|Hemp-lime is a natural, {{sustainable}} {{low carbon}} insulating material. It is formed from three main constituents: hemp shiv; lime based binder; and, water.

40|$|Axial {{shortening}} in <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> {{elements of}} reinforced concrete high-rise buildings {{is caused by}} the time dependent effects of shrinkage, creep and elastic shortening of concrete under loads. Such phenomenon has to be predicted at design stage and then updated during and after construction of the buildings in order to provide mitigation against the adverse effects of differential axial shortening among the elements. Existing measuring methods for updating previous predictions of axial shortening pose problems. With this in mind, a innovative procedure with a vibration based parameter called axial shortening index is proposed to update axial shortening of vertical elements based on variations in vibration characteristics of the buildings. This paper presents the development of the procedure and illustrates it through a numerical example of an unsymmetrical high-rise building with two outrigger and belt systems.

30|$|Most {{structures}} experience inelastic deformations when {{subjected to}} severe earthquake ground motions. Therefore, the nonlinear behavior of structures {{should be taken}} into account to have accurate estimation of deformation demands. The extensive set of nonlinear analyses of the model buildings presented opportunities for the investigation {{of a large number of}} different response characteristics. Different performance criteria were also defined to verify structural or nonstructural elements under various performance levels. Structural performance level life safety (LS) is considered for the Cd assessment carried out in the present study. In the LS performance, the structure, or any part of it, does not collapse, retaining integrity and residual load capacity after the earthquake. The structure is significantly damaged and may have moderate permanent drifts but retains its full <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity and sufficient residual lateral strength and stiffness to protect life even during strong aftershocks. Thus, nonlinear static (pushover) analysis and nonlinear time history analysis were used at life safety structural performance level. To do so, the SNAP- 2 DX (Rai et al. 1996) program was used.|$|R

The girder-end gap of {{a bridge}} should preferably be narrowed from the {{standpoint}} of the durability of the expansion joint and noise reduction but is required to be widened, when seismic isolation supports are used, from the aspect of preventing collision.

These are capable of <b>bearing</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>loads</b> including wheel loads on a normal basis, readily having large deformation in the bridge longitudinal direction during an earthquake to follow the sway and slide of the girders, and being easily exchangeable after an earthquake to make the bridge highly restorable.

The inclusion of fibers was effective in preventing scaling from fractured blocks, and the use of expanded polystyrene enabled the blocks to recover more than 50 % of their ultimate deformation...|$|R
