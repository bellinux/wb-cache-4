It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, and Venezuela where its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical swamps and heavily degraded former forest.|$|E
50|$|The <b>velvet-fronted</b> <b>grackle</b> has two {{separate}} populations; {{one is in}} Venezuela and Guyana; the other is in southern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, northern Peru, western Brazil and northern and central Bolivia. Its typical habitat is v√°rzea forests which periodically become flooded, forest borders and swamps near ponds; rivers and lakes.|$|E
50|$|The adult pale-eyed {{blackbird}} {{is entirely}} black in both sexes. It has white or pale buff coloured irises to its eyes {{which are very}} distinctive and distinguish it from other black birds found in the area such as the <b>velvet-fronted</b> <b>grackle</b> and the shiny cowbird which have dark eyes. Juveniles and immature birds are brownish-black with underparts streaked with yellow or buff.|$|E
5000|$|The male <b>velvet-fronted</b> <b>grackle</b> {{grows to}} about 22 cm {{and the female}} about 19 cm. Both sexes are entirely black, with a slight bluish gloss on the dorsal surfaces. The {{feathers}} {{at the front of}} the crown are very short and dense, giving a velvet-like appearance at close quarters. The beak is short, conical and pointed, the iris is dark and the tail is long and somewhat rounded. The calls produced include a crackling [...] "chack" [...] and a whistling [...] "cheziit", and the song, sometimes sung at dusk from a perch, is a moderately-musical rapid gurgling sound. This species could be confused with the shiny cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis), but their calls and habits are quite different.|$|E
5000|$|The male unicoloured {{blackbird}} is befitting of its name, with entirely glossy black plumage {{and dark}} eyes. However, the species exhibits sexual dimorphism; the female is streaked brown and black {{with a yellow}} belly streaked with brown. The face has a dark mask and the wings are reddish-brown edged with black. Females from the lower Amazon region and southeastern Brazil have a generally duller colouration with less rufous wings and less yellow underparts. The legs and the irids are black and the bill is long and sharply pointed. The male could {{be confused with the}} <b>velvet-fronted</b> <b>grackle</b> or the chopi blackbird. Its call of this bird is a loud [...] "tchew-tchew-tchew" [...] which is sung from an elevated position, and it also produces various trills and rattling sounds which vary in tone and pitch.|$|E
