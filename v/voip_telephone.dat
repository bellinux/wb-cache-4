5|$|The IEEE 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) {{standard}} specifies a {{more elaborate}} power negotiation scheme than powered USB. It operates at 48VDC and can supply more power (up to 12.95W, PoE+ 25.5W) over a cable up to 100meters compared to USB2.0, which provides 2.5W {{with a maximum}} cable length of 5meters. This has made PoE popular for <b>VoIP</b> <b>telephones,</b> security cameras, wireless access points, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the distance is short and power demand is low.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Depending on {{the content}} of speech frames, the quality {{impairment}} after their loss differs widely. In previous publications we described an off-line measurement procedure to determine the loss impairment – the importance – of single speech frames. We showed that knowing the importance of frames can enhance the transmission performance of <b>VoIP</b> <b>telephones</b> significantly if only important frames are transmitted. Here we study to what extend the importance can be calculated at real-time: The loss impairment is due to the imperfect packet loss concealment (PLC) and also due to error propagation (EP). EP originates from the desynchronisation of the decoder’s internal state and cannot be calculated at real-time. We developed a measurement method to determine the effect of the imperfect PLC and the temporal progression of the error propagation. The results show the trade-off between algorithmic delay and the accuracy of real-time importance calculation: A good frame classification needs to look ahead 20 - 40 ms in order to calculate the importance precisely.
