5|$|Quadrophenia was revived for a {{film version}} in 1979, {{directed}} by Franc Roddam. The film attempted to portray an accurate <b>visual</b> <b>interpretation</b> of Townshend's vision of Jimmy and his surroundings, and included Phil Daniels as Jimmy and Sting as the Ace Face. Unlike the Tommy film, the music was largely relegated to the background, and was not performed by the cast as in a rock opera. The film soundtrack included three additional songs written by Townshend, which were Kenney Jones' first recordings as an official member of the Who. The film was a commercial and critical success, as it conveniently coincided with the mod revival movement of the late 1970s.|$|E
25|$|A {{marching band}} {{is a group}} in which {{instrumental}} musicians perform while marching, often for entertainment or competition. Instrumentation typically includes brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments. Most marching bands wear a uniform, often of a military style, that includes an associated school or organization's colors, name or symbol. Most high school marching bands, and some college marching bands, are accompanied by a color guard, a group of performers who add a <b>visual</b> <b>interpretation</b> to the music {{through the use of}} props, most often flags and rifles.|$|E
25|$|This <b>visual</b> <b>interpretation</b> encapsulates the {{personal}} piety of rural peasants, many illiterate, for whom salvation history was expressed in these crucial aspects of God's loving relationship {{with us and}} the Christian duty to love of neighbor. Sanctifying grace flows from the Paschal Victim on the Cross, an image Nicholas described in his vision by the stream, where the Tabernacle sits atop a spring that flows forth covering the earth, echoing the rivers flowing from the Temple in Ezekiel's visions. Such profound insights on the allegorical, anagogical and tropological senses of scripture are often lost in modern biblical exegesis that focuses too narrowly on the literal sense, the historical-critical method.|$|E

She was always {{birthing}} something visual in her head, and Nick Knight is just, well, he's prolific but he's so genius. It was about pushing the bar of what a music video should be and can be. [...] It's a different time; it's a different era; there are no limits. It is a viral message. I think that there's something in there for everyone, and that's what's so amazing about the video and so specific about the message." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1980, {{multi media}} artist / filmmaker Merrill Aldighieri {{was invited to}} screen a film at the nightclub Hurrah. At this time, music video clips {{did not exist in}} large {{quantity}} and the video installation was used to present an occasional film. To bring the role of visuals to an equal level with the DJ's music, Merrill made a large body of ambient visuals that could be combined in real time to interpret the music. Working alongside the DJ, this collection of raw visuals was mixed in real time to create a non-stop <b>visual</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the music. Merrill became the world's first full-time VJ. MTV founders came to this club and Merrill introduced them to the term and the role of [...] "VJ",inspiring them to have VJ hosts on their channel the following year. Merrill collaborated with many musicians at the club, notably with electronic musician Richard Bone to make the first ambient music video album titled [...] "Emerging Video". Thanks to a grant from the Experimental Television Center, her blend of video and 16mm film bore the influential mark of the unique Rutt Etra and Paik synthesizers. This film was offered on VHS through [...] "High Times Magazine" [...] and was featured in the club programming. Her next foray into the home video audience was in collaboration with the newly formed arm of Sony, Sony HOME VIDEO, where she introduced the concept of [...] "breaking music on video" [...] with her series DANSPAK. With a few exceptions like the Jim Carrol Band with Lou Reed and Man Parrish, this series featured unknown bands, many of them unsigned.|$|E
2500|$|The Samkhya-Yoga {{philosophical}} {{concepts of}} Prakriti-Purusha bonds {{are used in}} the film. Prakriti and Purusha, as philosophical concepts, have their genealogy in the Samkhya-Yoga school of Indian philosophy. In Samkhya thought, Purusha is the Transcendental Self or Pure Consciousness. It is absolute, independent, free, imperceptible, unknowable, above any experience, and beyond any words or explanation. It remains pure, nonattributive consciousness. Purusha is neither produced nor does it produce. Unlike Advaita Vedanta and like Purva-Mimamsa, Samkhya philosophy emphasises the plurality of the Purushas. Prakriti is the first cause of the universe – of everything except the Purusha, which is uncaused, and accounts for whatever is physical, both matter and force. Through its threefold gunas or characteristics of the physical universe, Prakriti binds Purusha, the self (in the minimal sense of awareness or sentience), which itself is not distinct from Prakriti. [...] A written commentary that throws light on Aravindan's interpretation of the play precedes his film proper. The opening scroll reads, [...] "This film is an interpretation of the Uttara Kanda of the Ramayana. Our mythologies and the epics are constantly re-created in retellings. The epic is the basis for this <b>visual</b> <b>interpretation</b> as well. This film deviates from established norms in how it visualises the protagonists and portrays the course of events in the epic." [...] The scroll explains that the film will try to reflect what it calls the epic's adi-sankalpam (original conception) of the theme and the protagonists. It states that [...] "the inner essence of the film is that woman is Prakriti. Ultimately Purusha, here conceived of as the masculine self, dissolves into Prakriti. Ezhuthachan's Adhyathma Ramayana, one of the first Malayalam poems, also views Rama as Purusha and Sita as Prakriti. Aravindan stated in an interview that [...] "C. N. [...] had made clear the prakriti-purusha notion in Ramayana". But Aravindan took the extraordinary cinematic step of representing Sita as Prakriti.|$|E

40|$|We {{formulate}} Dempster Shafer Belief {{functions in}} terms of Propositional Logic using the implicit notion of provability underlying Dempster Shafer Theory. Given a set of propositional clauses, assigning weights to certain propositional literals enables the Belief functions to be explicitly computed using Network Reliability techniques. Also, the logical procedure corresponding to updating Belief functions using Dempster's Rule of Combination is shown. This analysis formalizes the implementation of Belief functions within an Assumption-based Truth Maintenance System (ATMS). We describe the extension of an ATMS-based visual recognition system, VICTORS, with this logical formulation of Dempster Shafer theory. Without Dempster Shafer theory, VICTORS computes all possible <b>visual</b> <b>interpretations</b> (i. e. all logical models) without determining the best interpretation(s). Incorporating Dempster Shafer theory enables optimal <b>visual</b> <b>interpretations</b> to be computed and a logical semantics to be maintained.
