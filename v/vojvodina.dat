5|$|Once {{the area}} was secured, {{defensive}} positions were established along the Čelić–Lopare road and company strength units were sent out to conduct reconnaissance. On the night of 17–18 March, elements of the Partisan 16th <b>Vojvodina</b> Division and 36th <b>Vojvodina</b> Division mounted unsuccessful attacks against the 28th Regiment's positions at Koraj and Zabrđe, losing over 200.|$|E
5|$|After Operation Save, the {{division}} remained relatively static {{for more than}} three weeks, mopping up and repelling local Partisan attacks. The Muslims were impatient to push further into Bosnia, but the reconnaissance battalion was heavily engaged on {{the division}}al western flank, attacking positions held by the Partisan 3rd <b>Vojvodina</b> Brigade of the 36th <b>Vojvodina</b> Division at Gornji Rahić on 26 March, killing 124 Partisans and capturing 14. The battalion captured several more Partisan positions in the following week. In early April, 200 Partisans of the 16th Muslim Brigade surrendered to the division. They were mostly former members of various Muslim militias who had been conscripted into the ranks of the Partisans.|$|E
5|$|By May 1947, {{authorities}} in <b>Vojvodina</b> {{noted that there}} was a dispute between them and the {{authorities in}} Croatia regarding the interpretation of the position of the border along the Danube, and that the federal authorities, who were asked to mediate in the dispute, supported the position of Croatia. At the same time, <b>Vojvodina</b> requested that Croatia return the territories on the right bank of the Danube that had previously been ceded to it (Varoš-Viza and Mala Siga). While in the Yugoslav framework, the issue received little further attention as its resolution was discouraged by the federal authorities, and because the area involved had limited economic value, was uninhabited and frequently flooded.|$|E
5|$|Having {{completed}} the anti-bureaucratic revolution in <b>Vojvodina,</b> Kosovo, and Montenegro, Serbia secured {{four out of}} eight federal presidency votes in 1991, which rendered the governing body ineffective as other republics objected and called for reform of the Federation.|$|E
5|$|The Partisans then {{committed}} the 16th <b>Vojvodina</b> Division {{to assist the}} 36th <b>Vojvodina</b> Division that had borne the brunt of Operation Heiderose to this point. On 20 July, both divisions attacked the 27th Regiment, which counterattacked the following day after the Partisans were rebuffed with heavy casualties. On 23 July, the Partisans began to withdraw south out of the area. The division began {{to search for the}} hidden Partisan bases that German intelligence had indicated were located there. After a day of searching, the division uncovered more than ten Partisan bases, which the cooperating Chetniks began to clear despite having shown little interest in actually fighting the Partisans in previous days.|$|E
5|$|The first general {{outline of}} the post-1945 borders of Croatia {{was made by the}} Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia on 24 February 1945. Some issues {{regarding}} the border, such as Baranja, were left unresolved. The newly established Autonomous Province of <b>Vojvodina,</b> a part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia since April 1945, sought to establish its border with the Socialist Republic of Croatia along the Drava River, thus including Baranja, the Danube and along the Vukovar–Županja line. To counter the claims made by <b>Vojvodina,</b> Croatian authorities staked counterclaims in the areas of Vukovar, Vinkovci, Baranja and in the area of Sombor.|$|E
5|$|Today {{estimates}} put {{the population}} of Nonius horses at about 450 mares and 80 stallions. The largest population is found at Mezőhegyes, with other herds in Romania, Bulgaria, and the Serbian province of <b>Vojvodina.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aiming {{to reduce}} {{evidence}} of political failure, Yugoslav authorities sought to disperse the refugees {{in various parts}} of Serbia and prevent their concentration in the capital, Belgrade. The government encouraged the refugees to settle in predominantly Hungarian areas of <b>Vojvodina,</b> and in Kosovo, which was largely populated by Albanians, leading to increased instability in those regions. Even though 20,000 were planned to be settled in Kosovo, only 4,000 moved to the region. After 12 August, the Serbian authorities started to deport some of the refugees who were of military age, declaring them illegal immigrants. They were turned over to the VRS or the ARSK in eastern Croatia for conscription. Some of the conscripts were publicly humiliated and beaten for abandoning the RSK. In some areas, ethnic Croats of <b>Vojvodina</b> were evicted from their homes by the refugees themselves to claim new accommodations. Similarly, the refugees moving through Banja Luka forced Croats and Bosniaks out of their homes.|$|E
5|$|By 1948, Croatia and Serbia {{agreed on}} two {{modifications}} of the border—the village of Bapska {{was transferred to}} Croatia, while Jamena {{was turned over to}} <b>Vojvodina.</b> No further changes to the border were agreed upon. A map of the area issued by the Yugoslav People's Army Military-Geographic Institute in 1967 depicts the border along the cadastre-based boundary, corresponding to the Croatian claim in the dispute.|$|E
5|$|Downstream from {{confluence}} of the Drina, the Sava River changes its eastward course to northeast, until it reaches Sremska Mitrovica, from where it flows to the southeast and then south to Šabac, before finally turning east towards Belgrade. Most of the river's course in Serbia represents a border between province of <b>Vojvodina,</b> on the left bank, and Central Serbia, on the right bank. Exceptions to that are in area around Sremska Mitrovica, where both banks are in <b>Vojvodina,</b> and downstream of Progar suburb of Belgrade where both banks are in Central Serbia. The river meanders and forms wetlands in there as well—the most significant wetland among them centering on Obedska bara oxbow lake. The Sava River forms several large islands in this segment of the course, with the largest among them— Ada Ciganlija in Belgrade—connected to the right bank {{by a pair of}} artificial embankment dams forming Lake Sava since 1967.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} settle the matter, the federal {{authorities}} set up a five-member commission presided over by Milovan Đilas in June 1945. The commission identified three sets of disputed territories. Those were the districts of Subotica, Sombor, Apatin and Odžaci in Bačka, districts of Batina and Darda in Baranja, and districts of Vukovar, Šid and Ilok in Syrmia. The districts in Bačka were awarded to <b>Vojvodina,</b> while those in Baranja were awarded to Croatia, both primarily along ethnic lines. The commission also noted that if Yugoslavia managed to acquire the region of Baja from Hungary, the decision regarding Bačka would be reviewed. The district of Vukovar was also awarded to Croatia, while Ilok and Šid were assigned to <b>Vojvodina.</b> In case of Ilok, the decision was specified to be provisional until authorities are consolidated {{on either side of}} the boundary, when the issue would be reexamined.|$|E
5|$|After these territories {{returned}} to Yugoslav control, {{the military and}} national courts in Bačka prosecuted collaborators who had killed about 10,000–20,000 civilians. The Security Service of <b>Vojvodina</b> captured {{the majority of these}} people. Meanwhile, some of those who were responsible for the 1942 massacres in southern Bačka were captured in, and extradited from, the newly formed People's Republic of Hungary. In his book Mađari u Vojvodini: 1941–1946 ("Hungarians in Vojvodina: 1941–1946"; Novi Sad, 1996), Professor Sándor Kaszás from the University of Novi Sad listed a total of 1,686 executed war criminals by name, of whom around 1,000 were Hungarian.|$|E
5|$|C. m. monedula (Linnaeus, 1758), the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{is found}} in eastern Europe. Its range extends across Scandinavia, from southern Finland south to Esbjerg and Haderslev in Denmark, through eastern Germany and Poland, and south across eastern central Europe to the Carpathian Mountains and north-western Romania, <b>Vojvodina</b> in northern Serbia, and Slovenia. It breeds in south-eastern Norway, southern Sweden, and northern and eastern Denmark, with occasional wintering in England and France. It has been recorded as a rare vagrant to Spain. It has a pale nape and sides of the neck, a dark throat, and a light grey partial collar of variable extent.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Yugoslav {{president}} Josip Broz Tito in 1980, the political situation in Yugoslavia deteriorated, with national tension fanned by the 1986 Serbian SANU Memorandum and the 1989 coups in <b>Vojvodina,</b> Kosovo and Montenegro. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation. In the same year, the first multi-party elections were held in Croatia, with Franjo Tuđman's win raising nationalist tensions further. Some of Serbs in Croatia left Sabor and declared the autonomy of areas that would soon become the unrecognised Republic of Serbian Krajina, intent on achieving independence from Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Occupied by the Habsburgs {{three times}} (1688–1690, 1717–1739, 1789–1791), {{headed by the}} Holy Roman Princes Maximilian of Bavaria and Eugene of Savoy, and field marshal Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon respectively, Belgrade was quickly recaptured by the Ottomans and {{substantially}} razed each time. During this period, the city was affected by the two Great Serbian Migrations, in which {{hundreds of thousands of}} Serbs, led by two Serbian Patriarchs, retreated together with the Austrians into the Habsburg Empire, settling in today's <b>Vojvodina</b> and Slavonia.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{approximately}} 500,000 Volksdeutsche living in Yugoslavia before the war, about half were evacuated, 50,000 died in Yugoslav concentration camps, 15,000 {{were killed by}} the Partisans and about 150,000 were deported to the Soviet Union as forced labourers. They were also stripped of their property. By 1948, only 55,337 Volksdeutsche remained in Yugoslavia. Yugoslav Bačka is now part of <b>Vojvodina,</b> an autonomous province of Serbia, Yugoslav Baranja and Međimurje are part of modern-day Croatia, and Yugoslav Prekmurje is part of modern-day Slovenia.|$|E
5|$|The 28th Regiment drove south through Mačkovac {{and during}} {{fighting}} around Priboj, its 1st Battalion (I/28), {{made up of}} Albanians, incurred heavy casualties. The Partisan 3rd Corps then withdrew the 16th and 36th <b>Vojvodina</b> Divisions south across the Tuzla–Zvornik road. The reconnaissance battalion continued the advance, driving into the western Majevicas and capturing Srebrnik and Gradačac then linking up with the Croatian Home Guard 1st Mountain Brigade. The Germans considered Operation Osterei a major success, achieving all objectives with minimal losses.|$|E
5|$|After the Croatian Democratic Union won 1990 {{parliamentary}} {{elections in the}} Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs within the Republic worsened. The ethnic groups are also divided along religious lines as the Croats are Catholics while the Serbs are Orthodox Christians. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) confiscated the weapons of Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana - TO) forces to minimize resistance. On 17 August, tensions escalated into an open revolt by Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, {{and parts of the}} Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia. This revolt was followed in January 1991, by two unsuccessful attempts by Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of <b>Vojvodina</b> and Kosovo, to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces.|$|E
5|$|Celtic faced Yugoslavia (now Serbian) side <b>Vojvodina</b> Novi Sad in the quarter-finals, {{and lost}} {{the first leg}} 1–0 after a goal from Milan Stanić; this was Celtic's only defeat of the competition. The tie {{looked like it was}} going to end in a draw after Chalmers had given Celtic a 1–0 lead in the second leg. This would have {{resulted}} in the teams from having to go to Rotterdam for a replay. However, in the 90th minute captain Billy McNeill scored to give Celtic the victory. In the semi-finals, Czechoslovakian side Dukla Prague were beaten 3–1 in Glasgow, Johnstone put the hosts in front, before Stanislav Štrunc equalised. A second half brace from Willie Wallace gave Celtic the victory. The teams then drew 0–0 in Prague, which meant Celtic progressed to the final.|$|E
5|$|He {{joined his}} {{hometown}} football club, AIK Bačka Topola, as a youngster, and graduated {{to the senior}} side in 1998–99. He began as a centre back, but soon realised he preferred scoring goals to defending. Žigić's parents did {{not want him to}} take football seriously until he completed his education, and he remained with AIK Bačka Topola until 2001, scoring 68 goals in 76 matches in the Serbian League <b>Vojvodina,</b> the third level of Yugoslav football. When military service took him to Bar, he was able to play for the local club, Mornar, for whom he scored 15 goals from 23 appearances in the 2001–02 Second League of FR Yugoslavia. After trials in France with Saint-Étienne and Créteil came to nothing, Žigić returned home where he played 8 matches for third-tier club Kolubara, scoring 3 goals.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Vojvodina's Ministry of Agriculture {{complained to}} Serbia's Ministry of Forestry that the {{authorities}} in Vukovar refused to hand over four river islands, and then to Croatia's Ministry of Forestry regarding the same matter, asking for assistance. After Croatia refused the request, the Serbian authorities turned to the federal government. The federal authorities advised resolving the matter through mutual agreement and said that Vojvodina's interpretation of the law on its borders—that the border runs along thalweg of the Danube valley, i.e. along the river's midpoint—is erroneous because {{the law does not}} apply such wording. In a letter dated 18 April 1947, Yugoslav authorities said that the disputed river islands were the territory of Vukovar district and that the territory could not be transferred to <b>Vojvodina</b> before the border was defined otherwise.|$|E

5|$|In April 1941, Germany, Italy and Hungary invaded and {{occupied}} Yugoslavia. Montenegro {{was captured by}} the Germans, who soon withdrew, leaving the Italians to occupy it. The Montenegrins quickly developed grievances against the Italians related to the expulsion of Montenegrins from Kosovo and <b>Vojvodina,</b> the influx of refugees {{from other parts of}} Yugoslavia, and those fleeing Ustaše terror in the regions along the borders with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Montenegrins also had grievances against the Italian annexation of important food producing territory in Kosovo and a salt producing facility at Ulcinj to Albania, and the economic damage inflicted on many Montenegrins by the temporary removal of Yugoslav banknotes of 500 dinars and above from circulation. By the time of the invasion, Đurišić had been promoted to the rank of kapetan prve klase (captain first class).|$|E
5|$|More {{and more}} state institutions, private firms, organizations, and clubs joined the {{procession}} each year, and the event {{began to take}} on the character of a public holiday. During the 1930s, the laying of badnjak on the fire became a court ritual. It was performed, {{in the presence of the}} royal family, by representatives of the army in the Royal Palace's room with a fireplace. At the end of the 1930s in some parts of Yugoslavia, especially <b>Vojvodina</b> and Montenegro, the military badnjak ceremony was performed not in the barracks yard but in a square in the garrison town. An open fire was built, on which the badnjak was placed by an Orthodox priest in the presence of soldiers and citizens. This tradition, symbolizing the unity of state, church, and people, was ended by the outbreak of WorldWarII.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October, Galbraith {{informed}} Croatian President Franjo Tuđman of {{the plan}} without providing any details. Similarly, Ahrens and Eide informed RSK president Milan Martić. Although early Z-4 Plan negotiations were planned without actually disclosing the plan to Croatia and the RSK, elements {{of the plan}} were leaked to Belgrade and Zagreb newspapers in mid-October. According to Florence Hartmann, in October representatives of Tuđman and those of Serbian president Slobodan Milošević met in Graz, Austria to discuss the proposed reintegration of the RSK into Croatia and {{their opposition to the}} Z-4 Plan. Tuđman disliked the plan because it envisaged a Serb state in Croatia, while Milošević saw it as a dangerous precedent that could be applied to majority non-Serb or ethnically-mixed regions of rump Yugoslavia, such as Kosovo, <b>Vojvodina</b> and the Sandžak.|$|E
5|$|On 17 July, the {{operation}} began. Fierce resistance was immediately encountered by the 28th Regiment, while the 27th Regiment climbed the heights to Udrč before dusk without serious opposition. Early on 18 July, the Chetniks attacked from Matkovac towards Šekovići. The 27th Regiment reached Bačkovac and seized {{the high ground}} south of Šekovići on 19 July 1944. The 28th Regiment forced the Partisan 36th <b>Vojvodina</b> Division back. The battalion from 7th SS Division encountered serious resistance around Vlasenica but pushed through. On 19 July, the 28th Regiment drove north towards Gornje Petrovice to attack the Partisan 12th Corps at Živinice. The reconnaissance battalion of 7th SS Division pushed in from Vareš as a blocking force to stop the Partisans from withdrawing via Kladanj.|$|E
5|$|On 17–18 May 1944, the division, {{along with}} the local Majevica-Tuzla Chetnik unit {{commanded}} by Radivoj Kerović, commenced Operation Maiglöckchen (May Bell) to destroy several Partisan brigades in the Majevicas. The Partisans were encircled in the Stolice heights. An attempt by the Partisan 16th <b>Vojvodina</b> Division to relieve the surrounded force was defeated by the reconnaissance battalion and elements of the 28th Regiment. The relieving column was driven back across the Spreća. After heavy bombardment by the artillery regiment, the trapped Partisan force escaped south out of the pocket {{under cover of darkness}} on 18 May. The Partisans suffered considerable casualties, for example the 17th Majevica Brigade of the 27th East Bosnia Division lost 16 killed and 60 missing. At the conclusion of Operation Maiglöckchen, the 27th Regiment remained near Zvornik and the 28th Regiment deployed near Srebrenik.|$|E
5|$|Opportunistic {{and highly}} adaptable, the western jackdaw varies its diet {{markedly}} depending on available food sources. They {{have been recorded}} taking eggs and nestlings from the nests of the skylark (Alauda arvensis), Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), razorbill (Alca torda), common murre (Uria aalge), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), rock pigeon (Columba livia), and Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto). A field study of a large city dump {{on the outskirts of}} León in northwestern Spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in the early morning and at dusk, and engage in some degree of kleptoparasitism. The saker falcon (Falco cherrug) has been reported stealing food from western jackdaws on powerlines in <b>Vojvodina</b> in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, the Serbian Parliament {{enacted a}} law {{establishing}} Vojvodina's borders. It {{referred to the}} boundary proposed by the Đilas commission explicitly noting that it was temporary. The law noted that the border follows the Danube from the Hungarian border to Ilok, crosses the Danube leaving Ilok, Šarengrad and Mohovo in Croatia then moves south and leaves the cadastral municipalities of Opatovac, Lovas, Tovarnik, Podgrađe, Apševci, Lipovac, Strošinci and Jamena in Croatia, and everything east of the line in <b>Vojvodina.</b> The awarding of Ilok to Croatia was {{a departure from the}} findings of Đilas commission and it was based on a referendum held in the town on the matter in 1945 or 1946, when its population voted to be added to Croatia.|$|E
5|$|The first {{artillery}} {{attack against}} ZNG units in Erdut occurred on 25 July, when 24 mortar rounds were {{fired by the}} JNA from the Serbian province of <b>Vojvodina</b> on the opposite bank of the Danube. Besides {{the damage to the}} medieval Erdut Castle, the attack caused six deaths and resulted in the injury of 18 soldiers from the 1st Guards Brigade. The unit deployed approximately a hundred troops, stationed in a facility normally operated by Osijek water supply utility, earlier that month. The general area of the villages of Dalj, Erdut and Aljmaš was targeted by an artillery bombardment in the early morning of 1 August. Croatian sources indicate that the artillery fire came from the JNA 51st Mechanised Brigade on the left bank of the Danube and the Croatian Serb TO. The JNA denied taking part in the bombardment.|$|E
5|$|After two {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts by}} Serbia (supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of <b>Vojvodina</b> and Kosovo) {{to obtain the}} Yugoslav Presidency's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991 and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March, the JNA (supported by Serbia and its allies) asked the federal Presidency to give it wartime powers and declare a state of emergency. The request was denied on 15 March, and the JNA was brought {{under the control of}} Serbian President Slobodan Milošević. Milošević, preferring the expansion of Serbia to the preservation of Yugoslavia, threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency. The threat caused the JNA to gradually replace plans to preserve Yugoslavia with Serbian expansion. By the end of March, the conflict escalated after the first fatalities during an incident at Plitvice Lakes. The JNA stepped in, supporting the insurgents and preventing the Croatian police from intervening. In early April, leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to integrate the area under their control with Serbia; this was seen by the Government of Croatia as an intention to secede from Croatia.|$|E

5|$|Downstream of {{confluence}} of the Una River, the Sava is once again tracing an international border—between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its meandering course runs generally eastwards along Gradiška, and Slavonski Brod to Županja, where it turns south to Brčko. There, the river resumes its predominantly eastward course towards Sremska Rača and {{confluence of}} the Drina River. The right bank of the Sava, in this segment of its course, belongs to Bosnia-Herzegovina (with Bosnia's all three administrative entities, Republika Srpska, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Brčko District, having gateway to the river), while the opposite bank belongs to Croatia and its Sisak-Moslavina, Brod-Posavina and Vukovar-Srijem counties, except {{in the area of}} Jamena and further downstream—which belongs to Serbia and the province of <b>Vojvodina.</b> No cities in this segment of the course span the river as it represents an international frontier, but there are adjacent settlements located in two different countries, divided by the Sava.
