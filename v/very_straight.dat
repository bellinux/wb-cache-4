25|$|Plastic {{balls are}} also {{commonly}} thrown when a bowler wants a ball that will {{move in a}} <b>very</b> <b>straight</b> line, particularly while trying to make spares. Urethane balls are less common, but may still be used for strike shots on less oily lanes.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} tool for test analysis was the diagnostic light pipe. A probe inside a test device could transmit information by heating {{a plate of}} metal to incandescence, an event that could be recorded by instruments located {{at the far end}} of a long, <b>very</b> <b>straight</b> pipe.|$|E
25|$|Passing through Bedford, in to Cambridgeshire through St Neots, Godmanchester, Huntingdon, Hemingford Grey and St Ives, {{it reaches}} Earith. Here, the river enters a short tidal section before {{branching}} in two. The artificial, <b>very</b> <b>straight</b> Old Bedford River and New Bedford River, which remain tidal, provide {{a direct link}} north-east towards the lower river at Denver in Norfolk.|$|E
60|$|One morning, when Johnny Chuck had led {{the three}} little Chucks farther from home than usual, Farmer Brown's boy took it into his head to visit the old orchard. Johnny Chuck did not see him coming. You see, the orchard grass had grown so tall that even when he sat up his <b>very</b> <b>straightest,</b> Johnny could not always see {{over the top of}} it. So this morning he failed to see Farmer Brown's boy coming.|$|R

25|$|Until recently, Pliohippus was {{believed}} to be the ancestor of present-day horses because of its many anatomical similarities. However, though Pliohippus was clearly a close relative of Equus, its skull had deep facial fossae, whereas Equus had no fossae at all. Additionally, its teeth were strongly curved, unlike the <b>very</b> <b>straight</b> teeth of modern horses. Consequently, it is unlikely to be the ancestor of the modern horse; instead, it is a likely candidate for the ancestor of Astrohippus.|$|E
25|$|Finally, caves {{that are}} larger {{tend to be}} more complex. By far the {{majority}} of sea caves consist of a single passage or chamber. Those formed on faults tend to have canyon-like or angled passages that are <b>very</b> <b>straight.</b> In Seal Canyon Cave on Santa Cruz Island, entrance light is still visible {{from the back of the}} cave 189 m from the entrance. By contrast, caves formed along horizontal bedding planes tend to be wider with lower ceiling heights. In some areas, sea caves may have dry upper levels, lifted above the active littoral zone by regional uplift.|$|E
25|$|East of Cazenovia, US20 resumes its southward drift as it {{climbs into}} the high ground again and expands to four lanes, passing the small village of Morrisville in the process. It descends from there to its next state highway, NY46, where it reverts to two lanes for a brief concurrency, after which NY46 leaves for {{isolated}} Hamilton. The southern trend reverses itself after this junction, with first NY26 and later NY12B joining US20 to create another three-route overlap. This persists for three <b>very</b> <b>straight</b> miles until both leave to the north {{in the town of}} Madison. After another , the highway crosses into Oneida County.|$|E
50|$|The simplistic track {{consisted}} of a <b>very</b> fast <b>straight</b> down {{either side of a}} dual carriageway, punctuated at one end by a hairpin and at the other by a steep banking.|$|R

25|$|The front limbs {{were rather}} long with 55% {{of the length}} of the hind limbs. A quadrupedal stance would have been possible. The humerus was <b>very</b> <b>straight.</b> The hand was lightly built, short and broad. On each hand Ouranosaurus bore a thumb claw or spike that was much smaller than that of the earlier Iguanodon. The second and third digits were broad and hoof-like, and anatomically were good for walking. To support the walking hypothesis, the wrist was large and its {{component}} bones fused together to prevent its dislocation. The last digit (number 5) was long. In related species the fifth finger is presumed to have been prehensile: used for picking food like leaves and twigs or to help lower the food by lowering branch to a manageable height. Taquet assumed that with Ouranosaurus this function had been lost because the fifth metacarpal, reduced to a spur, could no longer be directed sideways.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} some modern full rollers such as Dave Ewald and Tom Smallwood. A full roller rolls the ball {{in such a way}} that the ball tracks over its full circumference, thus the name full roller. In {{addition}} to a full circumference ball track, the ball track itself crosses between the fingers and thumb through the palm in a diagonal path. A full roller release can be <b>very</b> <b>straight</b> such as Billy Hardwick rolled, or have up to a 90 degree or greater axis of rotation such as Tom Smallwood rolls. Usually a suitcase style grip with the thumb in the 9 o'clock position and the fingers in the 3 o'clock position (for a right hander) at the moment of release will create a full roller track. As the hand comes forward the thumb exits first, and the fingers still at 3 o'clock, lift up through the ball, causing it to rotate off the fingers to the left, creating side rotation and a horizontal track through the palm center of the ball.|$|E
25|$|Along with Bob Simpson, {{he formed}} an opening {{partnership}} that {{was regarded as}} one of the finest in Test history. Lawry was fast between the wickets, and the pair were especially well known for their understanding, as exemplified by their fluency in rotating the strike with quick singles. Lawry was known for his peculiar stance. He had little bend in his knees, and as a result batted with a stoop over his bat. He used his long reach to blunt spin bowling. He played with a <b>very</b> <b>straight</b> bat, combining well-organised defence with a somewhat limited range of strokes, marked by an efficiency of placement and an unusually heavy reliance on the hook shot. His strengths were regarded as his composure and intense concentration which powered a relentless single-mindedness. His defiant style was accentuated by his habit of tugging on his cap after every ball, as though starting afresh. John Snow wrote that 'He always had to be got out and even if you managed to knock all three stumps over he still stayed at the crease a moment looking round for some excuse to continue batting before reluctantly starting his walk back to the dressing room'. Lawry was also a left-hander during his winter baseball recreation, which equipped him with a powerful throwing arm.|$|E
50|$|The wood of Pyrus pashia {{is often}} hard, heavy and strong with light reddish-brown color. Its wood grain {{consists}} of a <b>very</b> fine, <b>straight</b> and even textured wood. Its density has a specific gravity of 0.70.|$|R

50|$|Endoceratidae is {{a family}} of large to <b>very</b> large <b>straight</b> shelled nautiloid {{cephalopods}} belonging to the order Endocerida that lived during the Middle and Late Ordovician.

500|$|Miniature Schnauzers {{are often}} {{described}} as non-moulting dogs, and while this is not entirely true, their shedding is minimal and generally unnoticeable. They are characterized by a rectangular head with bushy beard, mustache and eyebrows; teeth that meet in a [...] "scissor bite"; oval and dark colored eyes; and v-shaped, natural forward-folding ears (when cropped, the ears point straight upward and come to a sharp point). Their tails are naturally thin and short, and may be docked (where permitted). They will also have <b>very</b> <b>straight,</b> rigid front legs, and feet that are short and round (so-called [...] "cat feet") with thick, black pads.|$|E
500|$|Crawford's {{obituary}} in The Times {{described him}} {{as one of the best}} young players to play cricket in England and said: [...] "Although he invariably played in glasses, he was a most attractive player to watch, an aggressive hitter of the ball and a dangerous medium-paced bowler". Wisden {{described him as}} a [...] "hard-hitting batsman", and said he played mainly from the front foot. He had an orthodox batting technique, moved his feet well to get to the ball, and played <b>very</b> <b>straight.</b> Herbie Collins, who played with Crawford in Australia, described one of his innings as [...] "a hurricane innings, full of classical shots charged with dynamite." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{forewings}} {{are dark}} purple, more greyish at the base, {{with a broad}} dark yellow fascia nearly in the middle, <b>very</b> nearly <b>straight,</b> but rather nearer the base on the inner margin than on the costa. The hindwings are coppery-brown, but paler at the base.|$|R
500|$|Jardine {{was seen}} as having a {{classical}} technique. While batting, he stood <b>very</b> <b>straight</b> and side on to the bowler. His off-driving was powerful, his defence was excellent, and he was superb at judging {{the line of the}} ball and letting it pass by {{if it was going to}} miss his wickets. His on-side play was also excellent, being able to place the ball between fielders for easy runs. Christopher Douglas described Jardine as [...] "the epitome of the old-fashioned amateur". However, he also comments that his approach to batting was like that of a professional and that his back-foot batting was of a quality that few amateurs could manage. In 1928, Wisden's correspondent described Jardine as the most secure amateur batsman of the time, and identified his greatest strength as his defence and his [...] "mental gifts." [...] He played <b>very</b> <b>straight</b> and hit the ball hard in defence, but could not play all the strokes, particularly on the off side. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow believed that Jardine had modelled himself on C. B. Fry. He also noted that Jardine displayed good concentration, a strong desire to improve his batting and a fighting spirit that brought out his best in a crisis. He also said that Jardine could play every recognised cricket shot, but would not do so in a match and Robertson-Glasgow believed it was Jardine's one weakness as a batsman. The more important the occasion, the more defensive and restricted Jardine's batting became: [...] "In general, as the task grew greater, the strokes grew fewer." ...|$|E
500|$|In set pieces, Drogba {{has also}} been known for his free kick ability, known to strike the ball with power and pace. Dr. Ken Bray of University of Bath has {{described}} him as a specialist especially from central positions, and says that he [...] "really just passes the ball very hard". He adds, [...] "He hits it [...] <b>very</b> <b>straight</b> and appears {{to hit the ball}} with a very powerful side-foot action, almost like the technique used in a side-foot pass. Drogba's style is about beating the goalkeeper with speed and depth." [...] Drogba's diverse and robust playing style has seen him frequently cited as the toughest striker numerous defenders have had to face, these include Gerard Piqué, Carles Puyol, Chris Smalling, Nemanja Vidić, and Laurent Koscielny.|$|E
500|$|Genesis were {{targets for}} {{criticism}} throughout the 1970s {{from those who}} disliked progressive rock. Influential BBC DJ John Peel championed the band in their early years and they performed three sessions for him between 1970 and 1972, but he [...] "grew disillusioned with their later excesses". Some regarded the group as overtly middle class, paying {{particular attention to the}} founder members' private education, and claimed rock music was being taken away from the working class, whom they regarded as its core audience. Likening his background to that of the punk artist Joe Strummer, who had become a [...] "people's hero" [...] musician, Gabriel stated in 2013, [...] "To this day, we've never outgrown the snotty rich-kid thing ... we were always <b>very</b> <b>straight</b> about where we came from, and we were middle-class, not aristocratic". Gabriel's theatrics were unpalatable to some of the mainstream rock audience, resulting in a cult following rather than that of a mainstream rock band.|$|E

50|$|A {{favourite}} spectator vantage point, the Brünnchen {{section is}} composed of two right-hand corners and a <b>very</b> short <b>straight.</b> The first corner goes sharply downhill and the next, after the <b>very</b> short downhill <b>straight,</b> goes uphill slightly. This is {{a section of the}} track where on public days, accidents happen particularly at the blind uphill right-hand corner. Like almost every corner at the Nürburgring, both right-handers are blind. The short straight used to have a steep and sudden drop-off that caused cars to take off and a bridge that went over a pathway; these were taken out and smoothed over when the circuit was rebuilt in 1970 and 1971.|$|R
2500|$|On 25 January 2009, then Secretary of State for International Development Douglas Alexander {{supported}} the appeal telling Sky News: [...] "My appeal {{is a much}} more straight forward one.

That for me is a <b>very</b> <b>straight</b> forward case and I sincerely hope that the British people respond with characteristic generosity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both as a rower {{and as a}} rowing coach, Courtney {{was known}} for his {{distinctive}} stroke. This style of rowing would become known as the Courtney Stroke. The most evident trait of the stroke is the positioning of the back. The back is always kept in a <b>very</b> <b>straight</b> position. Courtney is quoted as saying, [...] "No kink in the back if I {{have anything to say about}} it." [...] He kept the back straight to allow the lungs to work without difficulty with no strain on the abdominal muscles. His idea was influenced by watching famous professional rower Harry Coulter in 1870 at Buffalo, New York.|$|E
2500|$|I {{will seek}} out a means of getting to Heaven by a little way—very short and <b>very</b> <b>straight,</b> a little way that is wholly new.

Well, I mean to try and find a lift by which I may be raised unto God, for I am too tiny to climb the steep stairway of perfection. [...] Thine Arms, then, O Jesus, are the lift which must raise me up even unto Heaven. To get there I need not grow; on the contrary, I must remain little, I must become still less.|$|E
50|$|A prospekt (проспе́кт) is a broad, multi-lane and <b>very</b> long <b>straight</b> {{street in}} urban areas. The term {{originated}} in the Russian Empire. It is often translated as avenue; however, {{it can also be}} interpreted as parkway since it is common that a prospekt is the main city route (Arterial road).|$|R
50|$|Pugs' {{legs are}} <b>very</b> strong, <b>straight,</b> of {{moderate}} length, and are set well under. Their shoulders are moderately laid back. Their ankles are strong, their feet are small, their toes are well split-up, and their nails are black. The lower teeth normally protrude further than their upper, {{resulting in an}} under-bite.|$|R
5000|$|Prospekt is cognate {{with the}} English term prospect, both derive from Latin {{prospectus}} [...] "view, outlook". In the 18th century Russia, prospekt was used specifically for <b>very</b> long <b>straight</b> streets, especially in St Petersburg, because they afforded a spectacular view {{from one end}} to the other when looking down them.|$|R
