40|$|BackgroundFractional CO 2 laser is an {{effective}} treatment for scars, but most patients complain about sharp burning pain, even after the application of lidocaine ointment. This study analyzed {{the impact of a}} <b>vibrating</b> <b>device</b> to nonpharmacologically reduce the acute pain of laser treatment, in accordance with the gate control theory of pain management. MethodsThis is a prospective study performed from May 2013 through March 2014. Fifty-three patients (mean age, 26. 7 years; range, 16 – 44 years) who had donated livers for liver transplantation were treated with a fractional CO 2 laser (10, 600 nm; model eCO 2, Lutronic Corp) for their abdomen scars. Laser treatment was applied 4 months after surgery. A commercially available, locally applied <b>vibrating</b> <b>device</b> (model UM- 30 M, Unix Electronics Co. Ltd.) was used, in an on-and-off pattern, together with the CO 2 laser. A visual analogue scale (VAS; 0, no pain; 10, most severe pain) of pain sensation was assessed and statistically analyzed using a paired t-test. ResultsThe average VAS score for pain with the <b>vibrating</b> <b>device</b> was 4. 60 and the average VAS score without the <b>vibrating</b> <b>device</b> was 6. 11. The average difference between scores was 1. 51 (P= 0. 001). ConclusionsA locally applied <b>vibrating</b> <b>device</b> was demonstrated to be effective in reducing pain when treating with a fractional CO 2 laser. Vibration treatment could be helpful when treating scars with fractional CO 2 laser in pain-sensitive patients, particularly children...|$|R

50|$|The {{base plate}} of Galileo {{vibration}} training devices is moving like a see-saw. This side alternating motion {{is supposed to}} mimic human gait in order to utilize nearly physiological motion patterns close to the side alternating human gait. The side alternation causes the hip to tilt which requires the contra lateral muscles of the back to be activated - while one leg is lifted the other drops. Compared to vertically <b>vibrating</b> <b>devices</b> the side alternating motion results in very low acceleration acting on the centre of gravity of the upper body and the head.|$|E
30|$|In {{the control}} group (I), after the {{measurements}} of pressure drop and rock permeability to water, gel of 0.2  PV and subsequent water slug of 0.2  PV were injected in the core successively, and 40  h for complete gel cross-linking in thermostat was needed. Then, the pressure drop and permeability to water of the core would be measured again. To analyze the influence of vibration on gelling in induction stage and accelerating stage, the unconsolidated sand pack (II) was fixed on the <b>vibrating</b> <b>device</b> before gel injection. Once the <b>vibrating</b> <b>device</b> was set on, gel was injected. The vibration lasted for 25  min, which was enough for gel and subsequent water injection. To analyze the influence of vibration on gelling in stability stage, time of thirty-nine hours and forty-five minutes was set for gel cross-linking in the thermostat, and then the core (III) was taken out and fixed on the <b>vibrating</b> <b>device</b> for fluctuation treatment which also lasted for 25  min.

40|$|Conflicting {{reports in}} the {{literature}} have raised the question whether radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) <b>devices</b> and <b>vibrating</b> massage <b>devices</b> have similar energy signatures and, hence, cause similar bioeffects in treated tissues. We used laser fiber optic probe hydrophone (FOPH) measurements, high-speed imaging and x-ray film analysis to compare fundamental elements of the energy signatures of two rESWT devices (Swiss DolorClast; Electro Medical Systems, Nyon, Switzerland; D-Actor 200; Storz Medical, Tägerwillen, Switzerland) and a <b>vibrating</b> massage <b>device</b> (Vibracare; G 5 /General Physiotherapy, Inc., Earth City, MO, USA). To assert potential bioeffects of these treatment modalities we investigated the influence of rESWT and <b>vibrating</b> massage <b>devices</b> on locomotion ability of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) worms. FOPH measurements demonstrated that both rESWT devices generated acoustic waves with comparable pressure and energy flux density. Furthermore, both rESWT devices generated cavitation as evidenced by high-speed imaging and caused mechanical damage {{on the surface of}} x-ray film. The <b>vibrating</b> massage <b>device</b> did not show any of these characteristics. Moreover, locomotion ability of C. elegans was statistically significantly impaired after exposure to radial extracorporeal shock waves but was unaffected after exposure of worms to the <b>vibrating</b> massage <b>device.</b> The {{results of the present study}} indicate that both energy signature and bioeffects of rESWT devices are fundamentally different from those of <b>vibrating</b> massage <b>devices.</b> Prior ESWT studies have shown that tissues treated with sufficient quantities of acoustic sound waves undergo cavitation build-up, mechanotransduction, and ultimately, a biological alteration that "kick-starts" the healing response.
