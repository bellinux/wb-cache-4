5|$|M-65 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like all other state highways. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> using the roads under its jurisdiction. They use a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. In 2009, MDOT's surveys calculated that the highest <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> along M-65 was 6,699cars north of the M-55 junction; the highest commercial AADT was 310trucks along the River Road National Scenic Byway segment north to the F-30 junction in Glennie. The lowest traffic counts were the 947cars and 107trucks near the northern terminus in Presque Isle County. The section of M-65 concurrent with M-32 has been listed {{as a part of}} the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorway}} {{carries a}} considerable <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> throughout the year; however, in the summer, its peak volume is {{nearly double the}} average, as traffic intensifies because of tourists travelling to Adriatic Sea resorts and back. Furthermore, the southernmost sections of the motorway serve Zagreb's sizeable suburban traffic.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} state's {{maintenance}} of M-117, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> that uses the roadway. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that between 1,392and 1,986vehicles used the highway per day.|$|E
25|$|Traffic is {{sometimes}} heavy, however, the major thoroughfares handle fairly high <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> {{without too much}} trouble.|$|R
50|$|The A35 {{trunk road}} {{passes through the}} village, which means the main street can have high <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Tauranga Eastern Link, {{completed}} in 2015, moved State Highway 2 away from Te Puke and removed large <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> from its streets.|$|R
5|$|In October 2012 {{the state}} {{government}} announced that the freeway's diamond interchange with Reid Highway will be upgraded with the installation of extra turning lanes and traffic lights. The project is an interim solution to lower congestion and reduce the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> using local roads to avoid the interchange. The longer term plan is to upgrade Reid Highway to a dual carriageway near the freeway interchange, including a second overpass bridge. The dual carriageway works are scheduled for construction in 2014â€“15.|$|E
5|$|The {{variations}} {{between the}} AADT and the ASDT traffic volumes {{are attributed to}} the fact that the motorway carries certain tourist traffic from Hungary to the Croatian motorway network and ultimately to the Adriatic Sea. On average the motorway carries 15% increased <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> during summer months. As the Hungarian M6 motorway is gradually extended towards the Croatian border and the A5 motorway's northern terminus, the number of tourists traveling along this route in summer months is increasing.|$|E
5|$|To {{accommodate}} increased rail traffic, a new railroad terminal {{was constructed}} in 1875, {{but it was not}} large enough to consolidate all train service in one location. A replacement station, called Union Station, opened on September 1, 1894. Although Chicago had a greater <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> at its own Union Station, more railroads met at St. Louis than any other city in the United States. Union Station's rail platform expanded in 1930 and operated as the passenger rail terminal for St. Louis into the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Arterials {{are major}} through roads that are {{expected}} to carry large <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> Arterials are often divided into major and minor arterials, and rural and urban arterials.|$|R
50|$|The {{concrete}} structure has been degraded {{by the use}} of de-icing salt, requiring expensive mitigation. In 2016 construction began on a replacement bridge designed to handle higher <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{will also}} bring with heavy pollution, as the heating system springs into life, regular <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> {{return to the}} roads, and local {{industry}} seeks {{to make up for}} losses.|$|R
5|$|As {{part of its}} {{maintenance}} duties, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{tracks the}} <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> on the highways it maintains. This number is {{expressed in terms of}} annual average daily traffic (AADT), a calculation of the average traffic for a segment of roadway on any average day of the year. In 2009, the department measured a peak of 19,719vehicles daily on the stretch north of Tittabawasee Road. The section south of the US10 interchange had the lowest traffic level at 9,315vehicles AADT. Additionally, entire route of M-47 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being one}} of the few major {{thoroughfares}} in Rome able to cope with a high <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> without congestion, it is the subject of much ire both within the Roman community and among historical scholars due to the circumstances under which it was constructed. The area around the church was rebuilt several times following the various Sacks of Rome, and again after having deteriorated due to the loss of prosperity resulting from the Papacy's relocation to Avignon during the 14th century. Through all of these reconstructions, the area in front of the short courtyard of Saint Peter's Basilica remained a maze of densely packed structures overhanging narrow side-streets and alleyways.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, {{the city walls}} shaped the route of Canterbury's modern ring road system, {{protecting}} the inner core of the ancient city, despite proposals under the Holden Plan of 1945 for a radical reshaping of the city's road network. During the 1950s, a stretch of Canterbury's walls were reconstructed, including two circular towers, {{as part of the}} redevelopment of the St George district. In the early 1980s, the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> around the West Gate was causing damage to the structure of the building. The remaining walls and West Gate are protected under UK law as scheduled monuments and as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
50|$|At {{the bottom}} of the {{hierarchy}} are local streets and roads. These roads have the lowest speed limit, and carry low <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> In some areas, these roads may be unpaved.|$|R
50|$|In 1964 this {{intersection}} was reworked into a four-lane {{divided highway}} to accommodate higher <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> in the intersection and to further smooth the harsh turning required {{to negotiate the}} alignment.|$|R
50|$|Skribble has {{released}} several mix albums, including two <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Traffic</b> Jams, two <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> MDMA, Essential Dance 2000 (on Atlantic Records), Essential Spring Break and Skribble's House (both on London-Sire Records) and Perfecto Presents: DJ Skribble (on ThriveDance/Perfecto Records).|$|R
