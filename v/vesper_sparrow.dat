60|$|Away went Peter Rabbit, lipperty-lipperty-lip, {{heading for}} the dear Old Briar-patch. Out of the grass just ahead of him flew a rather pale, {{streaked}} little brown bird, and as he spread his tail Peter saw two white feathers on the outer edges.

40|$|The {{relative}} abundance of grassland birds was estimated on an 81 -ha (200 -acre) dry to dry-mesic sand prairie in south, west Wisconsin over an 18 -year period (1987 - 2004). Birds were surveyed three {{times during the}} breeding season on seven, 2 -ha (5 -acre) strip transects in six different burn units. We compared results to time since fire and other habitat features. The average rotation of prescribed fires in the burn units ranged from three to six years. Seven species were selected for detailed analysis. These were grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum),- 18 -year average of 1. 33 birds per ha, field sparrows (Spizella pusilla) at 0. 64 birds/ha, eastern meadowlarks (Stumella magna) at 0. 54 birds/ha, lark sparrows (Chondestes grammicus) at 0. 50 birds/ha, mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) at 0. 18 birds/ha, dickcissels (Spiza americana) at 0. 17 birds/ha, and <b>vesper</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Poocetes gramineus) at 0. 07 birds/ha.

40|$|Conservation efforts {{over the}} last 20 years for the Gunnison Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus minimus) have {{involved}} extensive habitat manipulations done predominantly to improve brood rearing habitat for the grouse. However, the effects of Gunnison Sage-Grouse habitat treatments on sympatric avifauna and responses of vegetation to manipulations are rarely measured, and if they are, it is immediately following treatment implementation. This study examined the concept of umbrella species management by retrospectively comparing density and occupancy of eight sagebrush associated songbird species and six measures of vegetation in treated and control sites. Our results suggested that songbird densities and occupancy changed for birds at the extreme ends of their association with sagebrush and varied with fine-scale habitat structure. We found Brewer's Sparrows (Spizella breweri) decreased in density on treated sites and <b>Vesper</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Pooecetes gramineus) increased. Occupancy estimation revealed that Brewer's Sparrows and Green-tailed Towhees (Pipilo chlorurus) occupied significantly fewer treated points whereas <b>Vesper</b> <b>Sparrows</b> occupied significantly more. Vegetation comparisons between treated and control areas found shrub cover to be 26 % lower in treated sites. Lower shrub cover in treated areas may explain the differences in occupancy and densities of the species sampled based on known habitat needs. The fine-scale analysis showed a negative relationship to forb height and cover for the Sage Sparrow (Amphispiza belli) indicating, from vegetation measures showing grass and forb cover during a good precipitation year covered significantly more area in the treatment than the control sites, that Sage Sparrows may also not respond favorably to Gunnison Sage-Grouse habitat treatments. While {{the concept of an}} umbrella species is appealing, evidence from this study suggests that conservation efforts aimed at the Gunnison Sage-Grouse may not be particularly effective for conserving other sagebrush obligate species of concern. This is probably due to Gunnison Sage-Grouse habitat management being focused on the improvement of brood rearing habitat which reduces sagebrush cover and promotes development of understory forbs and grasses...|$|R

40|$|This {{summer was}} a 2 ̆ 2 {{something}} for everyone 2 ̆ 2 season. Ecologists, already excited by the apparent ability of Greater Prairie-Chickens to lek in improbable habitats, such as corn fields and dirt edges of Rainwater Basin playas, will welcome the use by Lark Buntings and <b>Vesper</b> <b>Sparrows</b> of wheat stubble fields with a growing corn crop. The <b>Vesper</b> <b>Sparrows</b> of the east, a different subspecies {{from those in the}} north and west, have been at the mercy of full-tillage cropping systems, but now have a reprieve and may even be increasing because of no-till and minimum tillage methods currently in vogue due to high fuel prices and conservation benefits. White-faced Ibis again nested in several places, and Red-shouldered Hawk is showing signs of expanding from its limited range at Fontenelle Forest. Very exciting was the confirmation of breeding {{for the first time in}} Nebraska of Ash-throated Flycatcher, only the second record of the species 2 ̆ 7 occurrence in the state. Hopefully confirmation is soon to follow for Broad-tailed Hummingbird, which has now twice been reported during the breeding season. A phenomenon that may be applicable to those early migrant passerines that appear well before local breeders seem to have finished breeding and have even contemplated migration, is molt-migration. A recent article in Birding ([URL] discusses this strategy for such species as Dusky Flycatcher, Warbling Vireo, Western Tanager, Lazuli Bunting, and Bullock 2 ̆ 7 s Oriole, which is probably best known for its early departure from breeding areas for an intermediate staging area where it molts, and then continues to its wintering grounds. The possibility was raised by Ted Floyd that Chipping Sparrow might be in this group as well. Unfortunately, other than the existence of many such rather early fall records for various species in areas where breeding does not occur, Nebraska has little data to support or contradict this idea. Observers should continue to report obvious indications of early fall movement (flocking, appearance out of breeding habitat, disappearance of adults) ...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} 50 years {{increasing}} agricultural practices have transformed native habitats into row~crop fields, making the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grass lands important habitat for wildlife populations. Limited information exists on how nongame grassland bird species relate to different stand ages and cover types of Conservation Reserve Program. Conservation Reserve Program grassland study sites (n = 42) were stratified by stand age (old [10 - 13 years] and new [0 - 3 years] grasslands), and cover types (CPI-cool-season grasslands and CPZ-warm-season grasslands) in eastern South Dakota. Field age rather than cover type was more predictive of grassland bird occurrence and density. Sedge wrens (Cistothorus platensis), common yellowthroats (Geothlypis mchas), savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), and bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) reached their highest occurrence and/or densities in old CRP grasslands while upland sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda), western meadowlarks (Stumella neglecta), and <b>vesper</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Pooecetes gramineus) reached their highest densities in new eRP plantings.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} four year field {{study on the}} movement patterns, community dynamics, and management of granivorous wintering grassland sparrows in Arizona. Chapter one focuses on within winter, local scale movement patterns. Recapture statistics and radiotelemetry both showed strong interspecific differences in movement, {{consistent with the idea}} that these species may partition niche space according to the regional coexistence mechanism. Both techniques ranked species from most to least sedentary as follows: Cassin's and Grasshopper <b>sparrows,</b> Baird's, <b>Vesper,</b> and Savannah and Brewer's sparrows. Data also indicated that fixed home range movements, and within-species constancy of movement behavior across years and study sites are generally the rule in this group. Correlations between bird abundance and summer rainfall suggest that movement may constrain large scale habitat selection processes. Chapter two presents larger scale movement data from grassland sparrows, along with a general discussion of facultative migration in birds. High between-year abundance fluctuations and low and variable rates of between-year recapture suggest that facultative migration strategies may be the rule in grassland sparrows. The use of alternative wintering sites by individual Grasshopper Sparrows provides direct evidence of limited facultative migration behavior. These patterns contrast with the largely non-facultative migration strategies that are the rule in birds. The evolution of facultative migration strategies is linked with unpredictable temporal variation in the spatial distribution of habitat conditions in the landscape. Chapter three presents three years of data on the effects of spring/summer burning and cattle grazing on wintering grassland <b>sparrows.</b> <b>Vesper</b> and Savannah <b>sparrows</b> responded positively to fire, while Cassin's Sparrows responded negatively. The ecologically and geographically restricted Baird's and Grasshopper sparrows utilized burned areas during the first post-bum winter and did not significantly respond to fire. Both Ammodramus sparrows also utilized the grazed pasture; they were more abundant there than in the ungrazed study area in one year. While field observations and a prior study suggest that heavy grazing can have a strong detrimental effect on Ammodramus sparrows, {{the results of this study}} suggest that moderate cattle grazing may be compatible with the conservation of these species...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 The {{encroachment}} {{of western}} juniper into mountain big sagebrush plant {{communities and the}} subsequent development of juniper stands results in significant changes in vegetation structure and complexity. This study described and compared vegetative structure and bird community measures among four cover types representing {{a broad range of}} structural stages among semi-arid, upland plant communities in central Oregon. Avian communities and vegetation were sampled in 4 vegetative structural stages (cover types), including: 1) post-burn grassland (< 5 years post-burn); 2) mountain big sagebrush-Idaho fescue shrub-steppe; 3) mid-successional western juniper; and 4) old-growth western juniper. The point count, or variable circular plot (VCP), method was used to survey birds in May and June of 1998 and 1999. Bird density estimates for each transect in each year, mean relative abundance, and species richness, evenness, and diversity were compared among cover types. Sixteen of 22 vegetation measurements were significantly different (P<_ 0. 05) among the four cover types. Mean bird species richness was greatest in the old-growth and mid-successional juniper types, with means of 22. 9 and 23. 6 species transecf 1, respectively. Bird species diversity (H) was similar between the old-growth (H'= 2. 499) and mid-successional (H'= 2. 416) cover types. Mean species richness was lower in the grassland cover type (17. 6 species transect) and lowest in the shrub-steppe cover type (11. 5 species transect 1). Bird species diversity was similar in grassland and shrubsteppe, H= 1. 820 and H= 1. 644. Habitat complexity was evaluated by comparing the diversity of coverage of plant structural types. Indices of habitat complexity were calculated for each transect by using physiognomic cover diversity (PCD). Bird species diversity was positively correlated with PCD (r 2 = 0. 535; P= 0. 0013). Total bird density was significantly greater in 1999 than in 1998 (P<_ 0. 05). Total bird density was greatest in old-growth juniper (6. 551 birds ha) and lowest in post-burn grasslands (3. 569 birds ha 1). Total bird density was similar in shrub-steppe and mid-successional juniper (5. 968 and 5. 542 birds ha- 1, respectively). Old-growth juniper had the highest total densities of both tree and cavity nesters. Total density of ground nesting birds was greatest in the grassland type. Total density of shrub nesting species was highest in the shrub-steppe type. Species consistently detected within all four cover types were Empidonax spp. flycatchers, brown-headed cowbirds, and northern flickers. Species detected in juniper stands but not other types included chipping sparrows, mountain bluebirds, mountain chickadees, Cassin's finches, American robins, ash-throated flycatchers, and dark-eyed juncos. The most common species in the shrub-steppe were also present in mid-successional juniper, but at lower densities. Species composition in mid-successional juniper was a mixture of shrub-associated and tree-associated bird species. Many bird species that regularly occurred in old-growth juniper also occurred in mid-successional juniper, however, density and richness of shrub nesting species was lower in old-growth juniper. Mountain chickadees, Cassin's finches, chipping sparrows, brown-headed cowbirds, mountain bluebirds, and dark-eyed juncos, Empidonax spp. flycatchers, ashthroated flycatchers, and northern flickers were correlated with juniper canopy cover, canopy volume, total tree density, and average tree height. <b>Vesper</b> <b>sparrows,</b> western meadowlarks, green-tailed towhees, and horned larks were correlated with vertical density of herbaceous vegetation, total vertical density of all vegetative functional groups, and perennial grass cover. Brewer's sparrows, sage sparrows, sage thrashers, and horned larks were associated with total cover of all shrub species, cover of green rabbitbrush and sagebrush, vertical density of shrubs, and bare ground. In the absence of fire or direct management actions, the transition of mountain big sagebrush plant communities to juniper woodlands will likely result in decreased densities or loss of shrub nesting and sagebrush obligate birds. However, sites {{in the early stages of}} juniper transition, with an intact shrub component, may provide both shrub and tree-foliage nesting bird species with suitable breeding habitat. Old growth juniper stands provide both tree and cavity nesting species with breeding habitat, but shrub-nesting species will likely be absent or at very low densities because of low shrub cover. On a landscape level, a mixture of various ages of juniper stands, as well as juniper-free mountain big sagebrush and grassland will likely result in the greatest diversity of bird species...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 In grasslands, grazing {{by large}} {{ungulates}} can influence vegetation structure, composition, primary productivity, and ultimately, ecosystem functioning. While grazing represents a complex disturbance, grazing intensity largely determines {{the effects of}} grazing on vegetation. Structural and compositional changes in the plant community caused by grazing could have bottom-up effects on species and interactions at higher trophic levels. Thus, particular management strategies for domestic livestock in rangeland systems could exert a strong affect on grassland wildlife. Grassland-dependent songbirds may be particularly susceptible {{to the effects of}} domestic grazers because they depend on grassland vegetation for foraging and nesting. Domestic livestock may influence grassland-breeding bird populations by affecting settlement decisions, resource availability, or reproductive success. We investigated the effects of grazing intensity on grassland vegetation structure and songbird demography in a northwestern bunchgrass prairie using paddocks with experimentally-manipulated cattle stocking rates. We compared effects of four stocking rates (0, 14. 4, 28. 8, and 43. 2 animal unit months) on songbirds using a randomized complete block design with four replicates of each stocking rate to address hypotheses regarding demography of grassland songbirds. Overall paddock-level vegetation structure decreased and structural heterogeneity of vegetation increased with higher stocking rates, and those effects carried over one-year post-grazing. However, most bird species were able to locate nesting sites with similar vegetation structure regardless of paddock-level effects of stocking rate. The exceptions were western meadowlarks and vesper sparrows; nests of these species in paddocks with higher stocking rates had less vegetative cover. Apparent nest density for grasshopper sparrows was negatively affected by higher stocking rates. Grazing treatment effects on songbird population density were restricted to negative effects of higher stocking rates on savannah sparrows, but this relationship was not observed until the post-treatment year. Songbird community composition differed between control and heavily-grazed paddocks, but diversity was not affected by stocking rate. Nest fates were evaluated to determine whether stocking rate influenced nest survival or cause-specific nest failure. Other variables such as vegetation structure and predator community, date, year, and nest age were included to help clarify which mechanisms might be responsible for differences in nest survival or failure rates among treatments. For our analysis, we introduce the use of a novel software package, McNestimate, to estimate the daily probability of nest survival and failure from specific causes. McNestimate estimates the probability of nest failure from competing causes when the exact dates of failure are unknown using a Markov Chain framework, and incorporates a model selection approach which allows the use of covariates to help identify variables important in explaining variation in the daily probability of nest failure. Nest predation rates increased with the age of the nest and throughout the breeding season, but were not affected by stocking rate. The probability of nest failure from adverse weather declined throughout the season, but the rate of decline depended on year. Nest failure rates due to trampling were higher in paddocks with higher stocking rates, but also depended on the number of days cattle were present during the nesting period. Patterns of overall probability of nest success were driven by predation patterns in the first year, but in the second year were strongly influenced by the chances of weather-related nest failure. Although starvation was not identified as a significant source of nest failure, grazing-induced changes to vegetation structure and composition could influence food availability for breeding songbirds, ultimately affecting the composition of nestling diets and nestling condition. To better understand the relationship between grazing intensity, nestling diet composition, and subsequent effects on nestling condition, we examined the invertebrate composition of nestling fecal samples. All species showed strong preferences for Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) larvae, and partial preferences for Coleoptera (beetles) and Araneae (spiders). The proportion of preferred prey items was not affected by stocking rate. There were effects of bird species on the proportion of Araneae and Coleoptera and the proportion of Acrididae (short-horned grasshoppers) in the diet of western meadowlark nestlings decreased with high stocking rates. Growth rates for western meadowlarks and <b>vesper</b> <b>sparrows</b> were negatively affected by higher stocking rates. These results suggest that stocking rates can have variable effects on grassland songbird population and nest density depending on each species' habitat requirements. However, negative effects of high stocking rates on nest survival and nestling condition could have consequences for juvenile survival and recruitment. Overall, low-to-moderate stocking rates are likely compatible with many grassland bird species in northwest bunchgrass prairie, and although heavier livestock grazing may help create suitable vegetation structure for some songbird species, high stocking rates may influence grassland songbird diet quality, or have negative effects on nestling condition. We hypothesized that grazing intensity could influence the grassland songbird community through "bottom-up" effects on vegetation, but effects of grazing at different intensities did not translate directly through the food web to influence songbird populations as strongly as lower trophic levels. Processes responsible for changes in community composition such as immigration or emigration may not have had time to ensue during our short-term experiment; alternatively, sufficient spatial or temporal heterogeneity remained in the system, even at the highest grazing intensity, such that grazing-induced changes in lower trophic levels were irrelevant for most songbird species. Our results contribute to understanding grassland songbird demographic responses to different grazing intensities and identify specific mechanisms by which conservation measures for declining grassland bird populations can be improved...|$|R
40|$|On 6 August 1989, we {{observed}} a Sage Sparrow approximately one mile east of Coffee Park in Sow Belly Canyon in Sioux Co. The Sparrow flew {{from an area}} of sagebrush along the road and perched {{in the top of}} some brush about three to four meters high. The bird appeared to be an adult. Its bill was bluish-gray, breast was white with brownish streaks and a central dark spot. It had two faint pale wingbars, whitish eye-ring, a white stripe above the eye, whitish whisker stripe, grayish brown face patch, and light brown streaks on its sides. The head and nape were grayish, the back and wings were brownish, tail was slightly notched, and the crown was streaked with brownish marks. The under tail coverts appeared to have streaks. It was {{about the size of a}} <b>Vesper</b> <b>Sparrow.</b> We observed the Sparrow for about 10 minutes, from a distance of about 15 meters. The bird did not call or sing during the observation period. The sky was sunny and viewing conditions were excellent. It was viewed using 7 x 35 binoculars and a 15 - 60 power, 60 mm zoom telescope. A photograph of the bird was not obtained. A description of this encounter has been submitted to the Records Committee...|$|E
40|$|Livestock grazing in the shortgrass steppe of the Intermountain {{region of}} British Columbia is {{predicted}} to have significant effects on grassland habitats and their associated ground-nesting bird communities. We tested whether grazed and ungrazed sites could be discriminated {{on the basis of}} their vegetation communities, whether the abundance of two ground-nesting bird species, <b>Vesper</b> <b>Sparrow</b> (Pooecetes gramineus) and Western Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), differed between grazed and ungrazed sites, and whether vegetation variables found to differ between grazed and ungrazed plots could be used to predict the abundance of the two bird species at a fine scale. Grazed sites were easily distinguishable from a site that had been ungrazed for > 30 years based on the structure and composition of their vegetation communities. However, more detailed grazing categories could not be distinguished on the basis of vegetation characteristics. Despite the existence of grazing effects on vegetation structure and composition, we found no consistent differences in abundance of Vesper Sparrows and Western Meadowlarks between the grazed and ungrazed sites. However, there was weak evidence that the abundance of both species was higher at fine-scale plots (100 m radius point count station) with less bare ground and taller vegetation. Bare ground cover was lower on grazed plots, but vegetation was taller on ungrazed plots. Combined, our results suggest that low intensity grazing leads to grassland habitat change with both negative and positive effects on Vesper Sparrows and Western Meadowlarks, resulting in no net change in their broad-scale abundance...|$|E
