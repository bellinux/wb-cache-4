40|$|Cell-based therapies {{have been}} in use in {{veterinary}} medicine for years. However, the legal requirement of manufacturing, {{placing on the market}} and use of cell-based <b>veterinary</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> are not as well developed as the respective requirements of chemical <b>pharmaceuticals.</b> Cell-based <b>veterinary</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> are medicinal products {{in the sense of the}} pharmaceutical law of the European Union (EU). For that reason, such medicinal products principally require official approval for their manufacture and an official marketing authorisation for their placement on the market before being used by the veterinarian. The manufacture, placing on the market and use of cell-based <b>veterinary</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> without manufacturing approval and marketing authorisation is permitted only in certain exceptional cases determined by EU and individual Member State law. Violations of this requirement may have consequences for the respective veterinarian under criminal law and under the code of professional conduct in the respective Member State. The regular use of cell-based <b>veterinary</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> within the scope of a therapeutic emergency as well as the import of such <b>veterinary</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> from non-European countries for use in the EU are currently out of the question in the EU because of a lack of legal bases. Here, we review the general legal requirement of manufacturing, placing on the market and use of cell-based <b>veterinary</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> within the EU and point out different implementations of EU law within the different Member States...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePharmaceuticals {{residues}} are nowadays {{of growing}} concern, especially in aquatic environments. Numerous and detailed researches {{have been conducted}} on human pharmaceutical residues at national and european scale, while ocurrence of <b>veterinary</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> residues remains still largely unknown. Brittany is a region subjected to high animal husbandry pressures. <b>Veterinary</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> residues can enter the environment directly or indirectly during pastures or spreading of animal manure on soils. Thus, aquatic environments in Brittany are sensitive spots, potentially contaminated {{by a lot of}} veterinary residues, such as antibiotics or antiparasitic drugs. The project aims at realizing an overview of the contamination (types molecules and levels of concentrations) of raw water resources subjected to a strong agricultural pressure, and into drinking water obtained from those resources. In order to realize a monitoring study during one year, the first step was to perform a prioritization of <b>veterinary</b> <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> to select the <b>veterinary</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> which are the most susceptible to reach and to be detected in the aquatic environment...|$|R

The excellence and timeliness of the presentations indicated {{the need for}} an ACS Symposium Series book addressing the environmental chemistry and toxicology of this group of emerging contaminants. The purpose of this symposium was to bring together scientists from academia, government, and industry to discuss and present data relevant to the significance of <b>veterinary</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> in the environment. A broad range of topics was covered, including environmental chemistry studies focusing on transport, mobility, sorption, persistence, and bioavailability of the compounds, as well as development of analytical techniques relevant to detection of the pharmaceuticals in environmental matrices, discussion of ecotoxicological studies of <b>veterinary</b> <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> and information relevant to ecological risk assessments.
