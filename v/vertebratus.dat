5|$|Cirrus {{comes in}} four {{distinct}} species; Cirrus castellanus, fibratus, spissatus, and uncinus; which are each {{divided into four}} varieties: intortus, <b>vertebratus,</b> radiatus, and duplicatus. Cirrus castellanus is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body. Cirrus fibratus looks striated and {{is the most common}} cirrus species. Cirrus uncinus clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called mare's tails. Of the varieties, Cirrus intortus has an extremely contorted shape, and cirrus radiatus has large, radial bands of cirrus clouds that stretch across the sky. Kelvin–Helmholtz waves are a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear.|$|E
500|$|Cirrus <b>Vertebratus</b> clouds, {{resembling}} {{the appearance of}} bones as hinted by the word [...] "vertebratus". They look more like fish bones, with fibrous lines that originate from one which resembles the appearance of fish bones.|$|E
2500|$|A {{second group}} {{describes}} the occasional arrangements of cloud structures into particular patterns that are discernible by a surface-based observer (cloud fields usually being visible {{only from a}} significant altitude above the formations). These varieties are not always present with the genera and species {{with which they are}} otherwise associated, but only appear when atmospheric conditions favor their formation. Intortus and <b>vertebratus</b> varieties occur on occasion with cirrus fibratus. [...] They are respectively filaments twisted into irregular shapes, and those that are arranged in fishbone patterns, usually by uneven wind currents that favor the formation of these varieties. [...] The variety radiatus is associated with cloud rows of a particular type that appear to converge at the horizon. [...] It is sometimes seen with the fibratus and uncinus species of cirrus, the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus, the mediocris and sometimes humilis species of cumulus, and with the genus altostratus.|$|E
5000|$|Cirrus <b>vertebratus</b> {{is a type}} of cirrus cloud. The name cirrus <b>vertebratus</b> {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "jointed, articulated, vertebrated". Like cirrus intortus, the <b>vertebratus</b> species is {{exclusive}} to the cirrus genus. Cirrus <b>vertebratus</b> gives the impression of vertebrae in a spinal column, ribs, or a fish skeleton.|$|E
50|$|The word {{origin of}} {{vertebrate}} {{derives from the}} Latin word <b>vertebratus</b> (Pliny), meaning joint of the spine. The Proto-Indo-European language origins are still unclear.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} current {{knowledge of}} the occurrence of Dacini fruit flies in the Comoro archipelago of the Indian Ocean. Ten species are confirmed as occurring there: Bactrocera invadens Drew, Tsuruta & White, 2005, Dacus bivittatus (Bigot, 1858), D. ciliatus Loew, 1862, D. etiennellus Munro, 1984, D. punctatifrons Karsch, 1887, D. <b>vertebratus</b> Bezzi, 1908 (all Dacina), Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann, 1824), C. malgassa Munro, 1939, Neoceratitis cyanescens (Bezzi, 1923), and Trirhithrum nigerrimum (Bezzi, 1913) (all Ceratitidina). Records of Bactrocera Cucurbitae (Coquillett, 1899) remain unconfirmed. The fauna of the Comoros is briefly {{compared to that of}} other islands in the western Indian Ocean. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|At the time, now a {{good while}} ago, I {{described}} the mentioned Javanese Asilid (Tijdschr. voor Entomol. XV, p. 148), I had at my disposal only some defective specimens from the Leyden Museum, the antennae being incomplete: the third joint {{of them being}} wanting. At that time I overlooked an essential character of the genus Habropogon, viz. the unusual shortness of the first tarsal joint. Latterly having become acquainted with some true species of that genus, I am aware of my error in referring the above species to it. The examination of well preserved specimens {{in the collection of}} Mr. Neervoort van de Poll has taught me, that my Habropogon jucundus belongs to the genus Scylaticus Löw, and that it is identical with Sc. <b>vertebratus</b> Bigot (Ann. de la Soc. Entom. de France, 1878, p. 435), likewise from Java. The third antennal joint is indeed very slender, and longer than the two basal joints together; moreover the basal joint of the tarsi is of the usual shape...|$|E
