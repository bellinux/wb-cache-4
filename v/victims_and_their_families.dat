5|$|Hundreds of {{emergency}} personnel {{responded to the}} crash site and helped save victims. Many of those who survived were severely injured and required months or years to physically recover. NTSB investigators looked at various factors {{that contributed to the}} crash. The failures of the flight crew were cited as the probable cause of the crash, but the weather, air traffic controller performances, and FAA traffic management were also cited as contributing to the events that led to the accident. This conclusion was controversial, with disagreement between investigators, passengers, and Avianca as to who was ultimately responsible. Eventually, the U.S. government joined with Avianca and settled to pay for the damages to the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> The crash was also portrayed in a variety of media.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} came at {{a delicate}} time for relations between Iran and Western nations, which were removing sanctions on Iran after its compliance with an agreement for curtailing development of its nuclear enrichment program. The agreement stipulated that once Iranian compliance with {{the terms of the}} agreement was verified, most sanctions against Iran would be lifted, including all sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council as well as nuclear-related European Union and U.S. sanctions; U.S. sanctions against Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles would not be affected. In mid-January 2016, most sanctions were lifted. In March, the District Court for the Southern District of New York found, by default, that Iran had provided support to certain terrorist groups and individuals responsible for the September 11 attacks and awarded $10.5billion in damages to the plaintiffs, which consisted of $3billion to reimburse insurance companies for paid claims and $7.5billion for <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> ($2million for pain and suffering and $6.88million in punitive damages per victim). The same judge ruled just six months earlier that there was insufficient evidence linking Saudi Arabia—which has sour relations with Iran—to the 9/11 attacks to overcome, under the terrorism exemption, Saudi Arabia's immunity under the FSIA.|$|E
25|$|Four {{days after}} the tragedy, German DJ Markus Schulz sent a public message on Facebook, announcing to his fans that he will no longer hold concerts {{accompanied}} by pyrotechnics, also expressing his sympathy for the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b>|$|E
5000|$|On November 2009, Chin Peng {{issued an}} apology to the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> {{members of the}} atrocities done by the CPM.|$|R
50|$|These include {{certification}} {{of the forms}} persecution took, confirmation for pension and compensation payments, allowing <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members to inspect copies of the original documents and enabling the following generations {{to find out what}} happened to their forebears.|$|R
5000|$|... : Secretary-General António Guterres {{condemned}} the attack, offered his [...] "profound sympathy" [...] and condolences to the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family,</b> <b>and</b> that he [...] "hopes {{that those who}} are responsible for this despicable attack will be swiftly found and bought to justice".|$|R
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, there were multiple and far-ranging events that were observed. Besides the immediate impact on the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families,</b> the attacks caused widespread anger among the Indian public, and condemnations from countries throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards, the US {{suspended}} treaty annuities to the Dakota {{for four}} years and awarded the money to the white <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> The men remanded by order of President Lincoln were sent to a prison in Iowa, where more than half died.|$|E
25|$|On June 24, Tsarnaev faced {{his victims}} in court as his death {{sentence}} was formally imposed. <b>Victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> {{were able to}} present impact statements to the court, and Tsarnaev, who had been silent throughout his month-long trial, apologized to the injured and the bereaved in the bombings.|$|E
2500|$|A {{lawsuit filed}} in November 2011 by <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members alleges that the government's failure {{to take action}} against Hasan before the attack was willful {{negligence}} prompted by [...] "political correctness." [...] The 83 claimants seek $750 million in compensation from the Army.|$|R
2500|$|In November 2009, Chin {{issued an}} apology to the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members for the atrocities {{committed}} by the CPM. [...] However, the then-Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Dato' Haji Muhyidin replied that despite Chin's apology, he would still {{not be allowed to}} return to Malaysia.|$|R
25|$|Carolyn McCarthy—whose husband Dennis McCarthy {{was killed}} by Ferguson, and whose son Kevin McCarthy was {{severely}} injured—was subsequently elected to the United States Congress, {{on a platform of}} gun control. She was motivated to run for Congress after the representative in her district Dan Frisa voted against an assault weapons bill. Some of Ferguson's other <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members have also become involved in gun control efforts.|$|R
25|$|There {{was also}} a $5 billion lawsuit filed by the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> against the owner, landlord, city, and some {{building}} material manufacturers. That suit was settled during July 1995 for $15.8 million or $163,000 per victim. The lesser amount was due mostly to unrelated financial difficulties of the landlord.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{a student}} named Keanu Richal Karami raised {{awareness}} for Typhoon Ondoy by playing his violin while raising 10,000 pesos and donating {{it to the}} <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> At the time, he was a local hero as being interviewed by basketball player Chris Tiu, the show Ako Mismo and Philippine Star.|$|E
25|$|Three {{decades have}} passed since the disaster, yet <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> still suffer the effects of that day. Many {{psychological}} studies were undertaken in the months and years after the fire {{and found that the}} events left many in the affected communities with the effects of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).|$|E
50|$|Representing some 85 <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members, the Shurat HaDin lawsuit {{alleges that}} the Amex and the Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB) unlawfully {{performed}} {{millions of dollars}} in wire transfers for Hizbollah between 2004 and 2006. The plaintiffs assert that Hizbollah used the funds transferred by Amex Bank and LCB to prepare and carry out the rocket attacks which the terrorist organization rained on Israeli cities between July 12 and August 14, 2006.|$|R
5000|$|... : The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs {{issued an}} {{official}} statement condemning the attacks, noting that [...] "we reaffirm that terror act {{is a crime}} {{that could not be}} justified, no matter what the motive, where, when, and by whom it is done". Minister of Foreign Affairs Retno Marsudi has also made a phone call to her Iranian counterpart to express condolences and the deepest sympathy to all the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family.</b>|$|R
5000|$|.....the Buddha {{has stated}} {{very clearly that}} 'no killing' is {{the first rule of}} the five basic moral ethics (the Five Precepts). It is {{absolutely}} impossible for Buddha to speak favorably of 'solving problems through killing'. Killings will only lead to more killings...it is not necessary for the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members to take revenge personally，and no third parties are needed to join into the network of killing. Their own karma will not let them run away.|$|R
25|$|Many Sikh Americans did {{not approve}} of the protests in India against the United States, and {{strongly}} condemned the actions, such as flag-burnings, taken by the protesters. U.S.-based Sikh community groups pledged assistance to the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families,</b> and urged Sikh Americans to organize interfaith vigils. They also organized to send an emergency response team to Wisconsin.|$|E
25|$|Organizers of the 2013 Vancouver Sun Run, {{which was}} held on April 21, 2013, donated $10 from every late entry for the race to help victims of the bombing at the Boston Marathon. Jamie Pitblado, {{vice-president}} of promotions for The Vancouver Sun and The Province, said the money would go to One Fund Boston, an official charity that collected donations for the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> Sun Run organizers raised anywhere from $25,000 to $40,000. There were over 48,000 participants, many dressed in blue and yellow (Boston colors) with others wearing Boston Red Sox caps.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} focus climaxed on April 23, when President Bill Clinton, {{along with}} Governor Keating and the Reverend Billy Graham, spoke in Oklahoma City. In the weeks following the bombing, rescue efforts ceased {{and the building}} was imploded. Through both his own works and the works of his wife Cathy Keating, Governor Keating gained both national and international attention for his efforts to help the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> Governor Keating also created a $6 million fund to assist victims and provide for college scholarships for children who lost a parent, or both parents, in the attack.|$|E
50|$|Fear of {{discussing}} the White Terror and the February 28 Incident gradually decreased with {{the lifting of}} martial law in 1987, culminating {{in the establishment of}} an official public memorial and an apology by President Lee Teng-hui in 1995. In 2008, President Ma Ying-jeou addressed a memorial service for the White Terror in Taipei. Ma apologized to the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members on behalf of the government, and expressed the hope that Taiwan would never again experience a similar tragedy.|$|R
50|$|Harassment directs {{multiple}} repeating obscenities and derogatory comments {{at specific}} individuals focusing, for example, on the targets' race, religion, nationality, or sexual orientation. This often occurs in chat rooms, through newsgroups, and by sending hate e-mail to interested parties. This may also include stealing {{photos of the}} <b>victim</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families,</b> doctoring these photos in offensive ways, and then posting them on social media {{with the aim of}} causing emotional distress (see cyber bullying, cyber stalking, hate crime, online predator, and stalking).|$|R
50|$|In 1998, the NCC {{created the}} Child Victim Assistance Project, managed by an attorney, to provide child <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> {{supporting}} <b>families</b> with information, and with support and advocacy services.|$|R
25|$|The {{conclusion}} contained many factual errors: eating {{fish and}} shellfish from {{other areas of the}} Shiranui Sea, not just Minamata Bay, could cause the disease; eating small amounts, as well as large amounts of contaminated fish over a long time also produced symptoms; the outbreak had not, in fact, ended in 1960 nor had mercury-removing wastewater facilities been installed in January 1960. Nevertheless, the government announcement brought a feeling of relief to a great many <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> Many felt vindicated in their long struggle to force Chisso to accept responsibility for causing the disease and expressed thanks that their plight had been recognised by their social superiors. The struggle now focused on to what extent the victims should be compensated.|$|E
25|$|A {{memorial}} to seven residents of Sutherland Shire who were victims is at Cronulla. Called The Seed, {{the work is}} based on the seed and foliage of the Banksia robur, a native plant indigenous to the Shire. This sculpture of pink sandstone is the centrepiece of the memorial. It is set in a black granite pond located in 'Peryman Place' not far from North Cronulla Beach, frequented by many of the seven <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> Two plaques are set into the granite surrounding the pond. The plaques carry the victims' photos, names, and ages; and also details of the event, the design's symbolism, its dedication, and a poem written by the families of the victims. The work is by sculptor Chris Bennetts and Ishi Buki Sandstone Sculpture.|$|E
500|$|After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, a {{local council}} in Newtown, Connecticut, {{established}} a program {{asking people to}} pray {{a minimum of three}} Hail Marys for the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> [...] Over 100,000 people pledged to say 3.25 million prayers.|$|E

50|$|A serial rapist can use online dating {{sites to}} {{identify}} potential victims. Threatening {{harm to the}} <b>victim</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> is another tactic used. Drugging the victim is sometimes employed. Some serial rapists are specific in identifying <b>their</b> targets <b>and</b> <b>their</b> schedules. A serial rapist may describe their activities on websites, describing the tactics they use to commit the sexual assault. One recent 18-year-old accused of serial rapes used messaging cell phone apps, Facebook, Kik, and Snapchat to establish a relationship with girls. Some serial rapists drive victims to remote locations.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the victim}} {{has joined the}} offender, various {{techniques}} are used to restrict the victim's access to communication with home, such as imposing physical punishment unless the victim complies with the trafficker's demands and making threats of harm and even death to the <b>victim</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family.</b> Sometimes, the <b>victims</b> will succumb to the Stockholm Syndrome because their captors will pretend to [...] "love" [...] and [...] "need" [...] them, even {{going so far as}} promise marriage and future stability. This is particularly effective with younger victims, because they are more inexperienced and therefore easily manipulated.|$|R
500|$|Following {{the events}} of the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks, Vedder and McCready were joined by Neil Young to perform the song [...] "Long Road" [...] from the Merkin Ball EP at the [...] benefit concert.

500|$|On October 28, 2008, Texas A {{settled the}} final lawsuit filed against {{them by the}} <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> The {{university}} agreed to pay $2.1million and promised that if Bonfire returned to campus that [...] "engineering oversight" [...] would be provided. The final lawsuit, filed against two companies that provided crane operators and cranes for the bonfire, was settled in April 2014.|$|E
500|$|The {{church is}} {{associated}} with the 1859 wreck of the Royal Charter off Anglesey; it was used as a temporary mortuary, and 140 of the victims are buried in the churchyard. Charles Dickens, who wrote about the loss of the ship, noted the care taken by the rector, Stephen Roose Hughes, for the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> [...] Hughes died a few years later following the strain of the events and is also buried in the churchyard.|$|E
