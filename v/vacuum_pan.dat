5|$|Elsewhere, salt is {{extracted}} from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. Traditionally, this was done in shallow open pans which were heated to increase the rate of evaporation. More recently, the process is performed in pans under vacuum. The raw salt is refined to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics. This usually involves recrystallization during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities (largely magnesium and calcium salts). Multiple stages of evaporation are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals, which are kiln-dried. Some salt is produced using the Alberger process, which involves <b>vacuum</b> <b>pan</b> evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake. The Ayoreo, an indigenous group from the Paraguayan Chaco, obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree (Maytenus vitis-idaea) and other trees.|$|E
2500|$|Commercially {{produced}} jams {{are usually}} produced {{using one of}} two methods. The first is the open pan method, which is essentially a larger scale version of the method a home jam maker would use. This gives a traditional flavor, with some caramelization of the sugars. The second commercial process {{involves the use of}} a vacuum vessel, where the jam is placed under a vacuum, which has the effect of reducing its boiling temperature to anywhere between 65 and 80°C depending on the recipe and the end result desired. The lower boiling temperature enables the water to be driven off as it would be when using the traditional open pan method, but with the added benefit of retaining more of the volatile flavor compounds from the fruit, preventing caramelization of the sugars, and of course reducing the overall energy required to make the product. However, once the desired amount of water has been driven off, the jam still needs to be heated briefly to [...] to kill off any micro-organisms that may be present; the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pan</b> method does not kill them all.|$|E
60|$|The great sugar-house was a {{wilderness}} of tubs and tanks and vats and filters, pumps, pipes, and machinery. The {{process of making}} sugar is exceedingly interesting. First, you heave your cane into the centrifugals and grind out the juice; then run it through the evaporating pan to extract the fiber; then through the bone-filter to remove the alcohol; then through the clarifying tanks to discharge the molasses; then through the granulating pipe to condense it; then through the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pan</b> to extract the vacuum. It is now ready for market. I have jotted these particulars down from memory. The thing looks simple and easy. Do not deceive yourself. To make sugar is {{really one of the}} most difficult things in the world. And to make it right, is next to impossible. If you will examine your own supply every now and then for a term of years, and tabulate the result, you will find that not two men in twenty can make sugar without getting sand into it.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of circulation and heat transfer in crystallisation <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans</b> that produce raw sugar in the sugar mill. The driving force for circulation and heat transfer occurs in the calandria tubes within <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans.</b> Numerical and CFD modelling is becoming a cost-effective and reliable way of developing vessel designs especially when there are complex physics and geometries involved, {{as is the case}} with <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans.</b> Currently, however, there are no working numerical models of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans</b> that can be confidently used to design pans with improved circulation and boiling. If the operation of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans</b> and specifically calandria tubes can be adequately modelled, the design of industrial <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans</b> can be improved to realise the benefits of obtaining more efficient circulation and heat transfer within the pan. The research aims to provide data on heat transfer and circulation in factory crystallisation <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans</b> and provide data on an experimental rig simulating a single calandria tube for validation of numerical models. Factory trials were conducted to obtain data on heat transfer and circulation in factory pans. A method for measuring circulation speeds in massecuite solutions and <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans</b> was refined as part of this research. The data collected from the factory trials enabled the operating conditions for the single calandria tube boiling rig experimental trials to be determined. The intention of the experimental rig was to simulate factory conditions to allow detailed examinations of the heat transfer process and vapour volume fraction profiles to be obtained. Natural and forced circulation conditions were investigated as both types of circulation are present in factory <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans.</b> The data gathered from these experiments were preliminary in nature as the rig did not adequately represent factory equipment. The research highlights problems associated with the boiling of viscous fluids, such as molasses on a laboratory scale. Strategies and recommendations are provided to enable a more adequate representation of factory conditions in the experimental rig. These improvements will allow more accurate data to be obtained that can be used to develop improved models of calandria tubes and <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans.</b> The experiments conducted on the single calandria tube detailed the physical changes and heat transfer characteristics for boiling in calandria tubes with changing material properties and heat input conditions. The experiments allowed fluid specific correlations to be obtained for heat transfer coefficients and vapour distribution during boiling in the calandria tubes. These correlations were used to develop numerical models of the boiling that occurs in calandria tubes. The numerical models provided a better understanding of the flow characteristics in the vessel and can facilitate the development of improved engineering designs. The project shows the applicability of a pilot scale rig to provide data that can be used to improve the understanding and modelling of flow and heat transfer in the calandria tubes of crystallisation <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans...</b>|$|R

40|$|The heat {{transfer}} and condensation of steam within the steam belt and the steam chest surrounding the calandria tubes of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans</b> and evaporators were investigated using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) modelling techniques. The flow of steam in evaporators and <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans</b> is an aspect that is not usually given much attention but it can influence the productivity of these vessels. The latent heat of the steam provides the heat to the juice or massecuite which induces the formation of vapour bubbles and drives the circulation of the fluid within the vessel. Strong and uniform circulation of the massecuite in <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans</b> increases the production capacity and improves {{the quality of the}} sugar produced. Non-uniform heating by the steam {{on the outside of the}} calandria tubes can contribute to uneven and inconsistent {{heat transfer}} to the juice or massecuite within the vessel. As a consequence under these circumstances the installed heating surface is not effectively utilised. Inconsistent heating can affect the performance of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans</b> since it influences the circulation of massecuite and the crystallisation rate of sugar. The CFD modelling investigation into the steam side operation of the calandria of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans</b> and evaporators was preliminary in nature but has shown promising results. The results of the CFD simulations were compared against measured data to determine the applicability of the CFD model. The condensation physics of the CFD model currently has limitations, yet despite these, the CFD model has identified some deficiencies in the flow of steam within the calandria.

40|$|Numerical and {{especially}} CFD modelling are becoming cost-effective and reliable ways to develop improvements in vessel designs. Simulating boiling in crystallisation <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans</b> {{is a very}} complex process that needs to consider non-isothermal conditions, multi-component, multiphase boiling and condensation. This level of complexity which has been captured in the SRI CFD model was previously too complicated for most CFD software. With improvements to the software, these complex physical processes can now be modelled, albeit a little cumbersomely. This paper details the development of CFD models to predict the circulation patterns and heat transfer occurring in natural circulation crystallisation <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans.</b> Model validation involved checking the circulation velocities predicted by the CFD model with circulation velocity data measured on factory pans. The predictions were in reasonable agreement with factory measurements. The validated CFD model was used to investigate the effect of altering key dimensions on batch pans and on two different continuous pan designs. The batch pan investigations included: •	Increasing the volumetric region above the calandria by flaring the pan body; •	Reducing the clearance underneath the calandria; and •	Changing the dimensions of the tubes (tube diameter and length) while maintaining the same heat transfer area and keeping the evaporation rate constant. The effect of variations in pan geometry, massecuite viscosity and operating level above the calandria were considered for the batch pan simulations. These results provide interesting insight into the complicated processes involved in the operation of natural circulation <b>vacuum</b> <b>pans...</b>|$|R

The measurement technique was based on laser doppler velocimetry (LDV). Factory trials were also conducted on a stirred batch pan and velocity measurements obtained using hot film anemometers. CFD models were developed for the different impeller designs and conditions for both the laboratory and factory pans. The data from the CFD modelling were matched against the laboratory data from the CSIRO velocity profiles and the factory data to validate the CFD models. The CFD models showed very good agreement to the CSIRO velocity profiles and also predicted the torque (power) applied to the impeller reasonably well. The CFD models also showed reasonable agreement to the factory data.
