40|$|This paper {{presents}} various experimental verifications for {{the theoretical}} analysis results of vibration suppression to a smart flexible beam bonded with a piezoelectric actuator by a velocity feedback controller and an extended state observer (ESO). During the {{state feedback control}} (SFC) design process for the smart flexible beam with the pole placement theory, in the state feedback gain matrix, the <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>gain</b> {{is much more than}} the displacement feedback gain. For the difference between the <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>gain</b> and the displacement feedback gain, a modified velocity feedback controller is applied based on a dynamical model with the Hamilton principle to the smart beam. In addition, the feedback velocity is attained with the extended state observer and the displacement is acquired by the foil gauge on the root of the smart flexible beam. The control voltage is calculated by the designed <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>gain</b> multiplied by the feedback velocity. Through some experiment verifications for simulation results, it is indicated that the suppressed amplitude of free vibration is up to 62. 13 % while the attenuated magnitude of its velocity is up to 61. 31 %. Therefore, it is demonstrated that the modified velocity feedback control with the extended state observer is feasible to reduce free vibration...|$|E

40|$|Collocated direct <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> with ideal {{point force}} {{actuators}} mounted on structures is unconditionally stable and generates active damping. When inertial actuators {{are used to}} generate the control force, the system can become unstable even for moderate <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>gains</b> due to an additional - 180 ° phase lag introduced by the fundamental axial resonant mode of the inertial actuator. In this study a relative velocity sensor is used to implement an inner <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> loop that generates internal damping in a lightweight, electrodynamic, inertial actuator. Simulation results for a model problem with the actuator mounted on a clamped plate show that, when internal relative <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> is used {{in addition to a}} conventional external <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> loop, there is an optimum combination of internal and external <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>gains,</b> which, for a given gain margin, maximizes vibration reduction.

40|$|We {{consider}} the distributed {{control of a}} network of heterogeneous agents with double integrator dynamics to maintain a rigid formation in 1 D Euclidean space. The control signal at a vehicle is allowed to use relative position and velocity with its two nearest neighbors. Most of the work on this problem, though extensive, has been limited to homogeneous networks, in which agents have identical masses and control gains, and symmetric control, in which information from front and back neighbors are weighted equally. We examine the effect of heterogeneity and asymmetry on the closed loop stability margin, which is measured by the real part of the least stable pole of the closed-loop system. By using a PDE (partial differential equation) approximation in the limit of large number of vehicles, we show that heterogeneity has little effect while asymmetry has a significant effect on the stability margin. When control is symmetric, the stability margin decays to 0 as $O(1 /N^ 2) $, where $N$ is the number of agents, even when the agents are heterogeneous in their masses and control gains. In contrast, we show that arbitrarily small amount of asymmetry in the <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>gains</b> can improve the decay of the stability margin to $O(1 /N) $. Poor design of such asymmetry makes the closed loop unstable for sufficiently large $N$. With equal amount of asymmetry in both position and <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>gains,</b> the closed loop is stable for arbitrary $N$ and the stability margin scaling trend can also be improved to $O(1 /N) $, but the sensitivity to disturbance becomes worse. Effect of asymmetry in position <b>feedback</b> <b>gains</b> alone and unequal amount of asymmetry in position and <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> are open problems. Numerical computations are provided to corroborate the analysis. Comment: The conference version of this paper will appear in CDC 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{vibration}} {{characteristics of}} inertial vibration feeders were analyzed. Combining active with passive vibration isolation, the hybrid vibration isolation of inertial vibration feeders was researched. Adopting the passive vibration isolation, the vibration transmissibility {{can be reduced}} effectively, but the work efficiency of the inertial vibration feeder is reduced too. By choosing right feedback variables and appropriate feedback gain, the vibration transmissibility and the work efficiency of the inertial vibration feeder can be improved markedly by the hybrid vibration isolation. When the <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>gain</b> {{is equal to the}} upper damping coefficient and the displacement feedback gain is equal to the upper spring stiffness, the inertial vibration feeder has the best work efficiency and the vibration transmissibility approximates zero.

40|$|The {{conventional}} design strategy of robot manipulator fixed gain joint controllers is to critically damp {{the system for}} the most extreme configuration condition to prevent overshoot.

The link <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>gain</b> is then modified by multiplier values associated with each zone. The values of the multipliers are determined by a learning process based on the performance criteria of fastest possible response without overshoot.

The proportion of the one third harmonic in the amplitude increases rapidly with the increase of the exciting frequency. The variation of the amplitude ratio of the one third harmonic and the first harmonic is wavy type.

40|$|AbstractPosition and <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>gains</b> {{should be}} tuned {{suitably}} to realize a stable position controller. We already proposed genetic algorithms with variable search spaces, which successfully address this problem. The effectiveness was proved through fine-gain tuning of a resolved acceleration controller, {{which is one}} of the model-based robotic servo controllers. Additionally, the viscous and Coulomb frictions of the joints were considered in the dynamic model of the manipulator, to realize a more realistic robotic simulation. As a result, undesirable oscillations caused by the friction were observed because of the nonlinearity of the friction model. In this paper, we add a low-pass filter to the velocity term in the resolved acceleration controller to reduce the influence of the friction. The improved controller is evaluated through fine-gain tuning for a trajectory-following control problem. Simulations are conducted by using the dynamic model of a PUMA 560 manipulator.

40|$|The {{neuromusculoskeletal}} {{model of}} this study was built to better understand the mechanisms behind negative position and <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>gains</b> as identified in human postural control (Van der Helm et al., 2002). Specifically, causes were sought which could explain: a) why Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) patients with tonic dystonia are unable to set negative gains (Schouten et al., 2003) when optimal posture control dictates these gains as desirable (Schouten et al., 2001; De Vlugt et al., 2001), and b) how these patients are still able to modulate the gains, although restricted to positive values (Schouten et al., 2003). The model is an integration of a biological realistic neural network based on Bashor (1998) with a 1 -degree of freedom musculoskeletal model derived from human shoulder studies (Stroeve, 1999; Van der Helm et al., 2002; Schouten et al., 2003). Muscle proprioceptors obtained from comparative studies (Prochazka and Gorassini, 1998 a,b) provide the neural network with feedback information from the musculoskeletal model. It has been suggested that the inability to set negative gains is due to neurotransmitter deficiencies in inhibiting synapses in the spinal neural network (Van Hilten et al., 2000; Jankowska and Hammar, 2002). Two synaptic connections were selected for possible disfunctioning: 1) the synapse which presynaptically inhibits the monosynaptic stretch reflex synapse, and 2) the synapse connecting the inhibitory interneuron to the motoneuron. A lack of presynaptic inhibition of the first resulted in an overly dominant monosynaptic stretch reflex with high, positive <b>feedback</b> <b>gains.</b> Disabling the second prevented several major proprioceptive feedback paths from providing the motoneurons with with negative stimulation, making the setting of negative <b>feedback</b> <b>gains</b> next to impossible. It was concluded that: a) both synapses {{play an important role in}} obtaining negative <b>feedback</b> <b>gains</b> and that disfunctioning of these synapses could account for the previously unexplainable <b>feedback</b> <b>gain</b> quantification results for healthy subjects and RSD patients, and b) a disabled synapse, other than the one presynaptically inhibiting the monosynaptic stretch reflex synapse, still allows for limited <b>feedback</b> <b>gain</b> modulation.

For this purpose, we first measured the vibrational {{velocity of the}} mirror using a Laser Doppler Vibrometer and then multiplied it with a gain and fed the signal back to the mirror to change its effective damping. We also investigate the influence of velocity and position feedback on the dynamic response of the same mirror through numerical simulations. For this purpose, first, a transfer function of the mirror was obtained based on the experimental frequency sweep data {{of the first two}} vibration modes. Then, the dynamic response of the mirror was investigated for different feedback gains via simulations.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyse the dynamic {{properties}} of the muscle spindle feedback system of shoulder muscles during a posture task. External continuous force disturbances were applied at the hand while subjects had to minimize their hand displacements. The results were analysed using two frequency response functions (FRFs) from which the model parameters were derived, being 1) the mechanical admittance and 2) the reflexive impedance. These FRFs were analysed by a neuromusculoskeletal model that implicitly separates the reflexive feedback properties (position, velocity and acceleration feedback gains) from intrinsic muscle visco-elasticity. The results show substantial changes in estimated reflex gains under conditions of variable bandwidth of the applied force disturbance or variable degrees of external damping. Position and velocity feedback gains were relatively larger when the force disturbance contained only low frequencies. With increasing damping of the environment, acceleration feedback gain decreased, <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>gain</b> remained almost constant and position feedback gain increased. It is concluded that under the aforementioned circumstances, the reflex system increases its gains to maximize the mechanical resistance to external force disturbances while preserving sufficient stability.

We first discuss the relationship between FEL and nonlinear adaptive control with adaptive feedback linearization, and show that FEL can be interpreted as a form of nonlinear adaptive control. Second, we present a Lyapunov analysis suggesting that the condition of strictly positive realness (SPR) associated with the tracking error dynamics is a sufficient condition for asymptotic stability of the closed-loop dynamics. Specifically, for a class of second order SISO systems, we show that this condition reduces to K 2 D. KP; where KP and KD are positive position and <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>gains,</b> respectively. Moreover, we provide a ‘passivity’-based stability analysis which suggests that SPR of the tracking error dynamics is a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic hyperstability. Thus, the condition K 2 D. KP mentioned above is not only a sufficient but also necessary condition to guarantee asymptotic hyperstability of FEL, i. e. the tracking error is bounded and asymptotically converges to zero. As a further point, we explore the adaptive control and FEL framework for feedforward control formulations, and derive an additional sufficient condition for asymptotic stability in the sense of Lyapunov. Finally, we present numerical simulations to illustrate the stability properties of FEL obtained from our mathematical analysis...|$|R

40|$|Simulations have {{previously}} shown that, for broadband excitation, adjusting the gain {{of a local}} <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> loop to maximise their absorbed power also tends to minimise the kinetic energy of the structure under control. This paper describes an experimental implementation of multiple <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> loops on a flat panel, whose gains can be controlled automatically by an algorithm that maximises their local absorbed power. Taking care to remove excessive phase shift in the control loop allows a stable <b>feedback</b> <b>gain</b> that is high enough to experimentally demonstrate the transition in control action between optimum damping and pinning of the structure. A simple search algorithm is then used to adapt the <b>feedback</b> <b>gains</b> of two control loops to maximise their local absorbed powers, thus demonstrating self-tuning. By measuring the power absorbed by each of these loops and also estimation of the kinetic energy of the plate from velocity measurements {{for a wide range}} of the two <b>feedback</b> <b>gains,</b> it is shown that not only does the adaptive algorithm converge to a set of <b>feedback</b> <b>gains</b> that maximise total power absorbed by the two feedback loops, but also that this set of <b>feedback</b> <b>gains</b> is very close to those that minimise the measured kinetic energy of the panel. <br/...|$|R

If the beam is excited at a single location, the optimum <b>feedback</b> <b>gain</b> varies with {{the position of the}} control system. It is shown that this variation depends partly on the location of the control force relative to the exciting force.

Although reflexes are involuntary, humans can adapt their reflexive settings to {{the characteristics of}} the disturbances. Reflex modulation is commonly studied by determining reflex gains: a set of parameters that quantify the contributions of Ia, Ib and II afferents to mechanical joint behavior. Many mechanisms, like presynaptic inhibition and fusimotor drive, can account for reflex gain modulations. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of underlying neural and sensory mechanisms on mechanical joint behavior. A neuromusculoskeletal model was built, in which a pair of muscles actuated a limb, while being controlled by a model of 2, 298 spiking neurons in six pairs of spinal populations. Identical to experiments, the endpoint of the limb was disturbed with force perturbations. System identification was used to quantify the control behavior with reflex gains. A sensitivity analysis was then performed on the neuromusculoskeletal model, determining the influence of the neural, sensory and synaptic parameters on the joint dynamics. The results showed that the lumped reflex gains positively correlate to their most direct neural substrates: the velocity gain with Ia afferent <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback,</b> the positional <b>gain</b> with muscle stretch over II afferents and the force <b>feedback</b> <b>gain</b> with Ib afferent feedback.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with decentralised <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> for the control of vibration on a flexible structure. Previous {{studies have shown that}} a direct <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> loop with a collocated force actuator produces a damping action. Multiple <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> control loops thus reduce the vibration and sound radiation of structures at low frequency resonances, where the response is controlled by damping. However, if the control gains are too high, so that the response of the structure at the control point is close to zero, the feedback control loops will pin the panel at the control positions and thus no damping action is generated. Therefore, in order to maximise the active damping effect, the <b>feedback</b> <b>gains</b> have optimum values and the loops need to be properly tuned. In this paper, a numerical investigation is performed to investigate the possibility of self-tuning the <b>feedback</b> control <b>gains</b> to maximise the power absorbed by the control loops and hence maximise the active damping. The tuning principle is first examined for a single feedback loop for different excitation signals. The tuning of multiple control loops is then considered and the implementation of a practical tuning algorithm is discussed. <br/...|$|R

Advances in design, materials and construction technologies, coupled with client and architectural requirements, are some of the drivers for light-weight and slender pedestrian structures, which are becoming increasingly susceptible to human induced vibrations.

40|$|Skyhook damping is {{an active}} {{vibration}} isolation method, which {{can also be used}} to reduce vibration transmission between masses in lumped parameter 2 degree of freedom (dof) systems. The method is based on measuring the absolute velocity of the clean body, multiplying it by a negative gain, and feeding the result back to a force actuator reacting between the clean and the dirty body. In such a way disturbances coming onto the clean body from the dirty body can be successfully rejected in a broad frequency band. However, the method is only suitable if the feedback loop is unconditionally stable such that appropriately high <b>feedback</b> <b>gains</b> can be applied. It has been previously shown that passive 2 dof systems can be classified as so called sub- or supercritical based on whether the skyhook damping loop is conditionally or unconditionally stable. For subcritical systems the absolute <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> loop is conditionally stable and a skyhook damping approach is consequently not appropriate due to a control spillover effect at the first resonance frequency. In such a case the feedback loop can be stabilized by including an appropriate amount of relative damping between the clean and the dirty body in addition to the skyhook damping. This approach has been referred to as blended <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback.</b> In this paper the application of the blended <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> on subcritical 2 dof systems is investigated using an auto-tuning controller. An algorithm to gradually change the relative and absolute <b>feedback</b> <b>gains</b> until the active isolation performance reaches its best by applying an optimal combination of the two gains is applied. It is shown that there is only one such optimal combination, that is, the performance surface has a global minimum. Furthermore there are no local minima so a trial and error algorithm can be applied. Although in the frequency domain finding the minimum of the performance surface is straightforward, in the time domain the determining the clean body mean squared velocity can take a considerable time per step of the algorithm, such that the convergence of the trial and error algorithm can be relatively slow. It is hypothesized that a model based approach in determining the step size may speed-up the convergence. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|High-amplitude {{response}} {{suppression of}} the primary resonance of a nonlinear plant under cubic <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> control is investigated. By means of the multiple scales method, two equations on the amplitude and phase of {{the response of the}} nonlinear system are obtained and the force-response and frequency-response curves are shown. The stability analyses for the open- and closed-loop responses of the system are carried out and the performance of the control strategy is investigated. The instantaneous power requirement of the control law is also examined. It can be demonstrated that appropriate choice for the <b>feedback</b> <b>gain</b> can greatly reduce the response amplitude of the primary resonance and completely eliminate the multiple responses. Finally the perturbation solutions are verified with numerical simulations...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In active {{constrained}} layer damping treatments {{there are}} two distinct physical mechanisms that contribute to vibration damping – increased passive damping due to increased shear in the viscoelastic material (VEM) layer, and damping due to transmission of active forces to the host structure. The present study demonstrates that the first mechanism is dominant when proportional feedback is used while the second mechanism is dominant when derivative feedback is used. In the case of proportional feedback, the shear in the VEM increases considerably so that the passive damping is significantly larger than that obtained for the zero-voltage case, but the active action is actually detrimental. In the case of <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback,</b> the shear strain levels in the VEM are virtually unchanged, {{and all of the}} damping augmentation is due to the active action. It is also seen that if position feedback is used, moderate values of VEM shear modulus that provide optimal passive damping, are best. On the other hand, if <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> is used, high values of VEM shear modulus that allow best transmission of active forces from the active piezoelectric layer to the host structure, provide maximum augmentation in damping, with the maximum total damping depending on the <b>feedback</b> <b>gain</b> used...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} civil {{engineering}} floors is increasingly being governed by their vibration serviceability performance. This trend {{is the result}} of advancements in design technologies offering designers greater flexibilities in realising more lightweight, longer span and more open-plan layouts. These floors are prone to excitation from human activities. The present research work looks at analytical studies of active vibration control on a case study floor prototype that has been specifically designed to be representative of a real office floor structure. Specifically, it looks at tuning fuzzy control gains with the aim of adapting them to measured structural responses under human excitation. Vibration mitigation performances are compared with those of a general <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> controller, and these are found to be identical in these sets of studies. It is also found that slightly less control force is required for the fuzzy controller scheme at moderate to low response levels {{and as a result of}} the adaptive gain, at very low responses the control force is close to zero, which is a desirable control feature. There is also saturation in the peak gain with the fuzzy controller scheme, with this gain tending towards the optimal <b>feedback</b> <b>gain</b> of the direct <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> (DVF) at high response levels for this fuzzy design...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes the time-delayed cubic <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> control {{strategy}} {{to improve the}} isolation performance of High-Static-Low-Dynamic-Stiffness (HSLDS) vibration isolator. Firstly, the primary resonance of the controlled HSLDS vibration isolator is obtained by using multiple scales method. The equivalent damping ratio and equivalent resonance frequency are defined to {{study the effects of}} <b>feedback</b> <b>gain</b> and time delay on the primary resonance. The jump phenomenon analysis of the controlled system without and with time delay is investigated by using Sylvester resultant method and optimization method, respectively. The stability analysis of the controlled system is also considered. Then, the 1 / 3 subharmonic resonance of the controlled system is studied by using multiple scales method. The effects of <b>feedback</b> <b>gain</b> and time delay on the 1 / 3 subharmonic resonance are also presented. Finally, force transmissibility is proposed to evaluate the performance of the controlled system and compared with an equivalent linear passive vibration isolator. The results show that the vibration amplitude of the controlled system around the resonance frequency region decreases and the isolation frequency band is larger compared to the equivalent one. A better isolation performance in the high frequency band can be achieved compared to the passive HSLDS vibration isolator...|$|R
40|$|Transient {{response}} such as {{ringing in}} a control {{system can be}} reduced or removed by <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback.</b> It is a useful control technique that should be covered in the relevant engineering laboratory courses. We developed <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> experiments using two different low cost technologies, viz., operational amplifiers and microcontrollers.

In this paper, we propose a nonlinear control strategy to prevent the destabilisation of the <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> loop due to stroke saturation. A time domain model of the stroke limited inertial actuator mounted on a single degree of freedom structure is derived. The stability of the nonlinear system under a <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> control with fixed gain is investigated using the describing function method for the detection of limit cycles.
