It remains quiet at pressures above 160 psia. Under noisy conditions, nozzle-wall boundary-layer separation {{and the associated}} tunnel shutdown appear to propagate slowly upstream, whereas under quiet conditions, the propagation is very rapid. A new diffuser insert has been designed, fabricated, and installed in the tunnel in order to start larger blunt models and increase run time. A flared cone with a circular-arc geometry was designed to generate large second-mode N factors under quiet flow conditions. When the computed N factor was 13, large instability waves were measured under quiet flow conditions using fast pressure sensors, but the flow remained laminar. Transition was observed only under noisy conditions. A laminar instability was detected {{in the wake of}} an isolated roughness element in the boundary layer on the nozzle wall; this appears to be the first such measurement at hypersonic speeds.

40|$|Transient or {{hysteresis}} {{effects in}} polycrystalline thin film CdS/CdTe cells are {{a function of}} pre-measurement voltage bias and whether Cu is introduced as an intentional dopant during back contact fabrication. When Cu is added, the current-density (J) <b>vs.</b> <b>voltage</b> (<b>V)</b> measurements performed in a reverse-to-forward voltage direction will yield higher open-circuit voltage (Voc), up to 10 mV, and smaller short-circuit current density (Jsc), by up to 2 mA/cm 2, relative to scanning voltage in a forward-to-reverse direction. The variation at the maximum power point, Pmax, is however small. The resulting variation in FF can be as large as 3 %. When Cu is not added, hysteresis in both Voc and Jsc is negligible however Pmax hysteresis is considerably greater. This behavior corroborates observed changes in depletion width, Wd, derived from capacitance (C) <b>vs</b> <b>voltage</b> (<b>V)</b> scans. Measured values of Wd are always smaller in reverse-to-forward voltage scans, and conversely, larger in the forward-to-reverse voltage direction. Transient ion drift (TID) measurements performed on Cu-containing cells do not show ionic behavior suggesting that capacitance transients are more likely due to electronic capture-emission processes.

40|$|The present {{invention}} concerns {{an electric}} welding machine having a power circuit for supplying {{power to the}} welding machine from the mains. The power circuit comprises: an AC/DC converter stage (2), designed to receive an AC <b>voltage</b> (<b>V</b> AC) from said mains at its input and to generate a first DC <b>voltage</b> (<b>V</b> rect) at its output; an up converter stage (3), designed to receive said first DC <b>voltage</b> (<b>V</b> rec t) at its input and to generate a second DC <b>voltage</b> (<b>V</b> DC) at its output; an output stage (10) in electric communication with said up converter stage (3), and designed to generate an output <b>voltage</b> (<b>V</b> sal) suitable for the welding process at its output, {{and a pair of}} output terminals (4 A, 4 B) designed to have a load connected thereto, said output <b>voltage</b> (<b>V</b> sal) being available at said output terminals.; The invention is characterized in that it comprises control means (6) for controlling said up converter stage (3) {{as a function of the}} value of a reference signal (Iref), check means (20) being provided for generating said reference signal (Iref), which are configured to receive at their input at least the value of said second <b>voltage</b> (<b>V</b> DC) on said energy accumulation means (5), so that said energy accumulation means (5) are able to absorb power changes of said mains as said output <b>voltage</b> (<b>V</b> sal) changes, due to the power absorbed by the load, to limit a voltage fluctuation induced in said mains...|$|R
