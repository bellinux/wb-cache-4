40|$|Abstract: A novel, non-touch, screen {{pointing}} “magic wand ” interface {{is proposed}} for surgeon’s use {{in an environment}} requiring simultaneous display of several patients ’ data over a continuous period of time. The magic wand or passive pointing device {{does not have any}} active energy source within it (as opposed to a laser pointer) and thus cannot easily be detected or identified. Thus, modeling and simulation task is carried out by generating high resolution color images of a pointer viewing via two digital cameras with a popular three-dimensional (3 D) computer graphics and animation program, Studio 3 D Max by Discreet is used for detection. These images are then retrieved for analysis into a Microsoft’s Visual C ++ program developed based on the theory of image triangulation. The program outputs the precise coordinates of the surgeon’s wand in the 3 D space along with its projection on a large view screen. The computational results of the pointer projection are compared to the known locations specified by the Studio 3 D Max for different simulated configurations. High pointing accuracy is achieved: a pointer kept 30 feet away correctly hits the target location within a few inches. This preliminary work will lead to a complex development for interactive hand pointing gesture recognition system and its applicability to a large <b>viewing</b> <b>display</b> environment. Keywords: Surgeon’s wand, screen pointing interface, passive pointer, image processing, hand pointing gesture Advances in medical research and technology drive the future of medicine, holding the promise of earlier and more accurate diagnosis of disease as well as safer and more effective treatments.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This article {{presents}} inter- and intraobserver agreement for estimates of polyp diameter using CT colonography, including {{the effects of}} different visualization displays and prior experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four observers, three of whom had prior experience with CT colonography, estimated the maximum diameter of 48 polyps using three different visualization displays: 2 D colonography window, 2 D abdominal window, and 3 D surface rendering. Each re-measured a subset of 10 polyps. Polyps measured 2 to 12 mm according to a colonoscopic reference. Inter- and intraobserver agreement and agreement with the reference measurement were determined using the Bland-Altman method, paired Student's t testing, analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and by calculating the components of variance. RESULTS: CT measurements overestimated polyp diameter, a phenomenon found least using the 2 D abdominal display. Generally, 95 % limits of agreement encompassed different size categories for individual polyps: the widest spanned 14. 6 mm (- 4. 6 mm to 10. 0 mm) for an experienced observer using the 3 D display. When using the 2 D abdominal display, no {{significant difference was found}} between estimates and the reference value for the other two experienced observers (p = 0. 83 and 0. 23). All the observers' measurements were significantly different from the reference when using the 3 D display (p < 0. 001). The novice was significantly different from the experienced observers in some analyses. Inter- and intraobserver agreement were poorest for the 3 D display. CONCLUSION: Measurement of polyp diameter from CT colonography is subject to variation contingent on the observer's experience and the <b>viewing</b> <b>display</b> used. Although 3 D visualization display is commonly used for polyp detection, it should not be used for measurement...|$|E

40|$|Perspective {{projections}} of cockpit displays of traffic information (CDTI) on CRTs to present vertical separation information to airline pilots were examined. The perspective projection was compared with plan view {{projections of}} the same air traffic situations. Comparison of the pilots' avoidance maneuvers made when using the perspective display with those made while using more the conventional plan <b>view</b> <b>display</b> showed that pilots maneuvered somewhat earlier with perspective displays. With the perspective display, they maneuvered more frequently in the vertical dimension. The bias to maneuver horizontally probably reflected the poorer presentation of vertical separation on previously used plan <b>view</b> traffic <b>displays.</b> The avoidance decisions made by pilots using both perspective and plan <b>view</b> <b>displays</b> shows fewer unsuccessful maneuvers and fewer maneuvers producing spacing violations with the perspective format...|$|R

IVCon enables users to create, examine, and modify their code in two different views: the woven view and the unwoven view. The woven <b>view</b> <b>displays</b> program code in colors that indicate which CCCs various code segments implement. The unwoven <b>view</b> <b>displays</b> code in two panels, one showing {{the core of the}} program and the other showing all the code implementing each concern in an isolated module.

40|$|AbstractNel-like protein 1 (NELL- 1) is an osteoinductive {{molecule}} {{associated with}} premature calvarial suture closure. Here we identified apoptosis related protein 3 (APR 3), a membrane protein {{known as a}} proliferation suppressor, as a binding protein of NELL- 1 by biopanning. NELL- 1 and APR 3 colocalized on the nuclear envelope of human osteoblasts. NELL- 1 significantly inhibited proliferation of osteoblasts co-transfected with APR 3 through further down-regulation of Cyclin D 1. The co-expression of NELL- 1 and APR 3 enhanced Ocn and Bsp expression and mineralization. RNAi of APR 3 significantly reduced the differentiation effect of NELL- 1. These {{findings suggest that the}} effects of NELL- 1 on osteoblastic differentiation and proliferation are partly through binding to APR 3.
