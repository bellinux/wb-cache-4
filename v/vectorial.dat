500|$|The {{development}} of vector calculus was Gibbs's other great contribution to mathematics. [...] The publication in 1901 of E. B. Wilson's textbook Vector Analysis, based on Gibbs's lectures at Yale, {{did much to}} propagate the use of <b>vectorial</b> methods and notation in both mathematics and theoretical physics, definitively displacing the quaternions that had until then been dominant in the scientific literature.|$|E
500|$|As Gibbs had {{advocated}} in the 1880s and 1890s, quaternions {{were eventually}} all but abandoned by physicists {{in favor of}} the <b>vectorial</b> approach developed by him and, independently, by Oliver Heaviside. [...] Gibbs applied his vector methods to the determination of planetary and comet orbits. [...] He also developed the concept of mutually reciprocal triads of vectors that later proved to be of importance in crystallography.|$|E
500|$|From 1880 to 1884, Gibbs {{worked on}} {{developing}} the exterior algebra of Hermann Grassmann into a vector calculus well-suited {{to the needs}} of physicists. [...] With this object in mind, Gibbs distinguished between the dot and cross products of two vectors and introduced the concept of dyadics. [...] Similar work was carried out independently, and at around the same time, by the British mathematical physicist and engineer Oliver Heaviside. [...] Gibbs sought to convince other physicists of the convenience of the <b>vectorial</b> approach over the quaternionic calculus of William Rowan Hamilton, which was then widely used by British scientists. [...] This led him, in the early 1890s, to a controversy with Peter Guthrie Tait and others in the pages of Nature.|$|E
500|$|Gibbs {{also had}} an {{indirect}} influence on mathematical economics. [...] He supervised the thesis of Irving Fisher, who received the first Ph.D. in economics from Yale in 1891. [...] In that work, published in 1892 as Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices, Fisher drew a direct analogy between Gibbsian equilibrium in physical and chemical systems, and the general equilibrium of markets, and he used Gibbs's <b>vectorial</b> notation. [...] Gibbs's protegé Edwin Bidwell Wilson became, in turn, a mentor to leading American economist and Nobel Laureate Paul Samuelson. [...] In 1947, Samuelson published Foundations of Economic Analysis, based on his doctoral dissertation, in which he used as epigraph a remark attributed to Gibbs: [...] "Mathematics is a language." [...] Samuelson later explained that in his understanding of prices his [...] "debts were not primarily to Pareto or Slutsky, but to the great thermodynamicist, Willard Gibbs of Yale." ...|$|E

2500|$|Professor Gibbs {{produced}} an 85-page outline of {{his treatment of}} vectors for use by his students and had sent a copy to Oliver Heaviside in 1888. [...] In 1892 Heaviside, who was formulating his own <b>vectorial</b> system in the Transactions of the Royal Society, praised Gibbs' [...] "little book", saying it [...] "deserves to be well known". However, {{he also noted that}} it was [...] "much too condensed for a first introduction to the subject".|$|E
2500|$|What {{are called}} Maxwell's equation's today {{are in fact}} a {{simplified}} version of the original equations reformulated by Heaviside, FitzGerald, Lodge and Hertz. The original equations used Hamilton's more expressive quaternion notation, a kind of Clifford algebra, which fully subsumes the standard Maxwell <b>vectorial</b> equations largely used today. In the late 1880s there was a debate over {{the relative merits of}} vector analysis and quaternions. According to Heaviside the electromagnetic potential field was purely metaphysical, an arbitrary mathematical fiction, that needed to be [...] "murdered". It was concluded that {{there was no need for}} the greater physical insights provided by the quaternions if the theory was purely local in nature. Local vector analysis has become the dominant way of using Maxwell's equations ever since. However, this strictly <b>vectorial</b> approach has led to a restrictive topological understanding in some areas of electromagnetism, for example, a full understanding of the energy transfer dynamics in Tesla's oscillator-shuttle-circuit can only be achieved in quaternionic algebra or higher SU(2) symmetries. It has often been argued that quaternions are not compatible with special relativity, but multiple papers have shown ways of incorporating relativity ...|$|E

The newly produced polypeptide chains are inserted directly into the ER by the ribosome undertaking <b>vectorial</b> synthesis and are then transported to their destinations, through the secretory pathway. Bound ribosomes usually produce proteins that are used within the plasma membrane or are expelled from the cell via exocytosis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{center of}} {{pressure}} [...] is {{the point where the}} total sum of a pressure field acts on a body, causing a force to act through that point. The total force vector acting at the {{center of pressure}} is the value of the integrated <b>vectorial</b> pressure field. [...] The resultant force and center of pressure location produce equivalent force and moment on the body as the original pressure field. Pressure fields occur in both static and dynamic fluid mechanics. [...] Specification of the center of pressure, the reference point from which the center of pressure is referenced, and the associated force vector allows the moment generated about any point to be computed by a translation from the reference point to the desired new point. It is common for the center of pressure to be located on the body, but in fluid flows it is possible for the pressure field to exert a moment on the body of such magnitude that the center of pressure is located outside the body.|$|E
2500|$|Proca came to {{be known}} as one of the most {{influential}} Romanian theoretical physicists of the last century, having developed the vector meson theory of nuclear forces in 1936, ahead of the first reports of Hideki Yukawa, who employed Proca's equations for the <b>vectorial</b> mesonic field [...] as a starting point. Yukawa subsequently received the Nobel Prize for an explanation of the nuclear forces by using a pi-mesonic field and predicting correctly the existence of the pion, initially called a 'mesotron' by Yukawa. Pions being the lightest mesons play a key role in explaining the properties of the strong nuclear forces in their lower energy range. Unlike the massive spin-1 bosons in Proca's equations, the pions predicted by Yukawa are spin-0 bosons that have associated only scalar fields. However, there exist also spin-1 mesons, such as those considered in Proca's equations. The spin-1 vector mesons considered by Proca in 1936—1941 have an odd parity, are involved in electroweak interactions, and have been observed in high-energy experiments only after 1960, whereas the pions predicted by Yukawa's theory were experimentally observed by Carl Anderson in 1937 with masses quite close in value to the 100 MeV predicted by Yukawa's theory of pi-mesons published in 1935; the latter theory considered only the massive scalar field as the cause of the nuclear forces, such as those that would be expected to be found in the field of a pi-meson.|$|E
