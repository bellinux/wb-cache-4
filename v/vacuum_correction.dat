40|$|In {{a recent}} {{publication}} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 143602] {{we have shown}} using a QED approach that, {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field, the quantum vacuum coupled to a chiral molecule provides a kinetic momentum directed along the magnetic field. Here we explain the physical mechanisms which operate in the transfer of momentum from the vacuum to the molecule. We show that the variation of the molecular kinetic energy originates from the magnetic energy associated with the <b>vacuum</b> <b>correction</b> to the magnetization of the molecule. We carry out a semiclassical calculation of the vacuum momentum and compare the result with the QED calculation. Comment: minor corrections made to agree with the published versio...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} the "two-point approximation" for highly non-local {{effective}} actions, {{in the particular}} case of the Chiral Soliton Model of the nucleon. The nucleon in this model is regarded as being made of three valence quarks bound together by a meson field in a soliton form. Mesons are treated in mean field theory and the vacuum energy due to one-quark loops is included. The theory is defined with a finite cut-off in momentum space, consistent with an effective theory for the low-energy description of the strong interactions. We use the two-point approximation to calculate the <b>vacuum</b> <b>correction</b> to the chiral soliton energy {{for a variety of}} soliton profile functions, investigating the effect of different regularisation schemes. Results are little influenced by the choice of the cut-off, and are within 20 % of exact calculations, done with the full inclusion of the Dirac sea. We then perform a dynamical calculation of the chiral soliton by including sea-quark effects self-consistently in the two-point approximation. We find a typical 20 % (or less) deviation in the soliton energy from exact calculations. We apply a further "pole" approximation which leads to a significant algebraic simplification in the self-consistent equations. We show, in particular, that a simple numerical fit of the pole form to the two-point cut-off function yields essentially indistinguishable results from the latter. We finally calculate some static nucleon observables in the two-point approximation and find general agreement with exact calculations. In view of the results obtained, we may hope that the pole form of the twopoint approximation may prove to be a generally useful approach to similar problems involving highly non-local actions. </p...|$|E
40|$|We are {{computing}} the modifications for the scalar and pseudoscalar meson {{masses and}} mixing angles {{due to the}} proper accounting of fermionic vacuum fluctuation {{in the framework of}} the generalized 2 + 1 flavor quark meson model and the Polyakov loop augmented quark meson model(PQM). The renormalized contribution of the divergent fermionic vacuum fluctuation at one loop level makes these models effective QCD-like models. It has been explicitly shown that analytical expressions for the model parameters, meson masses, and mixing angles do not depend on any arbitrary renormalization scale. We have investigated how the incorporation of fermionic vacuum fluctuation in quark meson and PQM models qualitatively and quantitatively affects the convergence in the masses of the chiral partners in pseudoscalar (π, η, η', K) and scalar (σ, a_ 0, f_ 0, κ) meson nonets as the temperature is varied on the reduced temperature scale. Comparison of present results in the quark meson model with vacuum term and PQM model with vacuum term with the already existing calculations in the bare 2 + 1 quark meson and PQM models, shows that the restoration of chiral symmetry becomes smoother due to the influence of the fermionic vacuum term. We find that the melting of the strange condensate registers {{a significant increase in the}} presence of the fermionic vacuum term and its highest melting is found in the PQM model with vacuum term. The role of the U_A(1) anomaly in determining the isoscalar masses and mixing angles for the pseudoscalar (η and η') and scalar (σ and f_ 0) meson complex has also been significantly modified due to the fermionic <b>vacuum</b> <b>correction.</b> In its influence, the interplay of chiral symmetry restoration and the setting up of the U_A(1) restoration trends have also been shown to be significantly modified.

40|$|The linear sigma {{model with}} quarks {{at very low}} {{temperatures}} provides an effective description for the thermodynamics of the strong interaction in cold and dense matter, being especially useful at densities found in compact stars and protoneutron star matter. Using the MSbar one-loop effective potential, we compute quantities that are relevant {{in the process of}} nucleation of droplets of quark matter in this scenario. In particular, we show that the model predicts a surface tension of Σ 5 - 15 MeV/fm^ 2, rendering nucleation of quark matter possible during the early post-bounce stage of core collapse supernovae.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{electromagnetic}} (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) signatures of stellar-mass compact objects (COs) spiraling into a supermassive black hole (extreme mass-ratio inspirals or EMRIs), {{embedded in a}} thin, radiation-pressure dominated, accretion disk. At large separations, the tidal effect of the secondary CO clears a gap. We show that the gap refills during the late GW-driven phase of the inspiral, leading to a sudden EM brightening of the source. The accretion disk leaves an imprint on the GW through its angular momentum exchange with the binary, the mass increase of the binary members due to accretion, and its gravity. We compute the disk-modified GWs both in an analytical Newtonian approximation and in a numerical effective-one-body approach. We find that disk-induced migration provides the dominant perturbation to the inspiral, with weaker effects from the mass accretion onto the CO and hydrodynamic drag. Depending on whether a gap is present, the perturbation of the GW phase is between 10 and 1000 radians per year, detectable with the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) at high significance. The Fourier transform of the disk-modified GW in the stationary phase approximation is sensitive to disk parameters with a frequency trend different from post-Newtonian <b>vacuum</b> <b>corrections.</b> Our results suggest that observations of EMRIs may place new sensitive constraints on the physics of accretion disks.
