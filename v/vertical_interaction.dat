40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the induction of the cell behaviors underlying neurulation in the frog,Xenopus laevis. Although planar signals from the organizer can induce convergent extension movements of the posterior neural tissue in explants, the remaining morphogenic processes of neurulation {{do not appear to}} occur in absence of <b>vertical</b> <b>interactions</b> with the organizer (R. Kelleret al., 1992,Dev. Dyn. 193, 218 – 234). These processes include: (1) cell elongation perpendicular to the plane of the epithelium, forming the neural plate; (2) cell wedging, which rolls the neural plate into a trough; (3) intercalation of two layers of neural plate cells to form one layer; and (4) fusion of the neural folds. To allow planar signaling between all the inducing tissues of the involuting marginal zone and the responding prospective ectoderm, we have designed a “giant sandwich” explant. In these explants, cell elongation and wedging are induced in the superficial neural layer by planar signals without persistent <b>vertical</b> <b>interactions</b> with underlying, involuted mesoderm. A neural trough forms, and neural folds form and approach one another. However, the neural folds do not fuse with one another, and the deep cells of these explants do not undergo their normal behaviors of elongation, wedging, and intercalation between the superficial neural cells, even when planar signals are supplemented with vertical signaling until the late midgastrula (stage 11. 5). <b>Vertical</b> <b>interactions</b> with mesoderm during and beyond the late gastrula stage were required for expression of these deep cell behaviors and for neural fold fusion. These explants offer a way to regulate deep and superficial cell behaviors and thus make possible the analysis of the relative roles of these behaviors in closing the neural tube...|$|R
40|$|Decentralization of {{expenditure}} responsibilities {{from central}} to local governments is generally thought to increase overall government accountability by bringing the policymaking process closer to citizens. In practice, decentralization reforms {{tend to be}} partial in nature, leading to the coexistence of multiple tiers of government in public good provision. Electoral accountability in such a context presents voters with the complex task of assessing the respective role of each level of government in the policy outcomes that they observe. This paper analyses the effects of such partial decentralization on accountability using a two-period political agency model, in which two levels of government are involved in public good provision and voters are imperfectly informed about each government’s contribution to the public good. The model predicts that a departure from complete centralization (or decentralization) will, in general, have ambiguous consequences for voter welfare, the benefits associated with the vertical complementarity among governments being weighed against the loss of accountability following from imperfect information and detrimental <b>vertical</b> <b>interactions</b> among levels of government. decentralization, accountability, shared responsibility, federalism, <b>vertical</b> <b>interactions...</b>|$|R

This paper explores whether such features of cooperative federations lead to subnational soft budget constraints using panel data from the German States covering the 1975 - 2005 period. The methodology {{is based on the}} premise that subnational governments' borrowing will exhibit vertical and horizontal strategic interactions if they operate under soft budget constraints. Therefore, a test for strategic interactions in subnational borrowing can be used to infer whether a cooperative federation like Germany is susceptible to soft budget constraints. The results suggest that state borrowing in Germany exhibited horizontal but not <b>vertical</b> <b>interactions</b> during the time-frame of the analysis. This indicates (i) that German States faced soft budget constraints and (ii) that they were more concerned about the likelihood of a bailout than about its volume. ...|$|R

This article proposes a cross-layer scheduling for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) based wireless networks. The scheduler combines opportunistic communications and link adaptation to serve users with multiple concurrent flows (applications) of different quality of service (QoS) requirements. For each time slot and on each OFDM subcarrier, the scheduler computes a cost function for each flow that depends on a flow's instantaneous link quality and service history. The flow with the least cost on an OFDM subcarrier is assigned the subcarrier, provided no other flow's delay constraint is in violation. The scheme is scalable, optimizes wireless throughput, traffic delay-aware, guarantees minimum service to all active flows, and has low implementation complexity...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} application of non-linear soil models in pipeline and riser design. A non-linear soil model is typically employed when investigating a complex pipe-soil interaction problem. Two main pipe-soil interactions are frequently studied: the <b>vertical</b> pipe-soil <b>interaction</b> at the touchdown point of the steel catenary riser (SCR) during cyclic heave motion, and the lateral pipe-soil interaction during the pipeline s lateral buckling. Mathematical models for non-linear pipe-soil interaction are presented. The interaction typically is represented using a force-displacement curve found by fitting {{a high number of}} test data points. In the lateral direction, the soil model developed by Verley and Sotberg is widely used in industry for assessing pipeline walking. In the vertical direction, Aubeny proposed a fairly good soil model which can capture important soil behaviour such as suction force and pipe-soil separation. The formulation and implementation of these models are the primarily focus of this thesis. New FORTRAN subroutines are created based on presented models. In lateral pipe-soil interaction, the soil subroutine, which is known as DNVMODEL-Y, includes mathematical models from DNV, PONDUS, and SAFEBUCK JIP. In <b>vertical</b> pipe-soil <b>interaction,</b> the soil subroutine, AUBENY-Z, includes the non-degradation vertical soil model developed by Aubeny. The soil subroutines are implemented inside the SIMLA software package to allow complete pipe-soil interaction analysis. Validation of the soil subroutines is conducted and presented in detail. Two validation methods are employed: comparing the results with related works/software and ascertaining the soil behaviour by various test cases using forced displacement load. Some applications of the developed soil subroutines in practical pipeline and riser analysis are presented in this thesis. Pipeline walking analysis using a non-linear soil model and Coulomb model is presented and discussed in detail. In regard to <b>vertical</b> pipe-soil <b>interaction,</b> deepwater SCR s response under forced heave motion is discussed.

We used expression profiling and mouse transgenic lines to identify and characterize two closely-related narrow-field AC subtypes.

Two transcription factors selectively expressed by these subtypes, Neurod 6 and Satb 2, regulate a postmitotic cell fate choice between them. Satb 2 induces Neurod 6, which persists in nGnG ACs and promotes their fate, but is down-regulated in the related glycinergic AC subtype.
