40|$|The <b>vitreous</b> <b>transition</b> is {{characterized}} by a freezing of atomic degrees of freedom at a temperature Tg depending on the heating and cooling rates. A kinetic origin is generally attributed to this phenomenon instead of a thermodynamic one which we develop here. Completed homogeneous nucleation laws reflecting the energy saving due to Fermi energy equalization of nascent crystals and their melt are used. They are applied to bulk metallic glasses and extended to inorganic glasses and polymers. A transition T*g among various Tg corresponds to a crystal homogeneous nucleation temperature, leading to a preliminary formation of a cluster distribution during the relaxation time preceding the long steady-state nucleation time of crystals in small samples. The thermally-activated energy barrier ΔG* 2 ls/kBT at T*g for homogeneous nucleation is nearly the same in all glass-forming melts and determined by similar values of viscosity and a thermally-activated diffusion barrier from melt to cluster. The glass transition T*g is a material constant and a linear function of the energy saving associated with charge transfers from nascent clusters to the melt. The <b>vitreous</b> <b>transition</b> and the melting temperatures alone are used to predict the free-volume disappearance temperature equal to the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann temperature of fragile glass-forming melts, in agreement with many viscosity measurements. The reversible thermodynamic <b>vitreous</b> <b>transition</b> is determined by the disappearance temperature T*g of the fully-relaxed enthalpy Hr that is not time dependent; the observed specific heat jump at T*g is equal to the proportionality coefficient of Hr with (T*g − Ta) for T ≤ T*g as expected from the enthalpy excess stored by a quenched undercooled melt at the annealing temperature Ta and relaxed towards an equilibrium vitreous state. However, the heat flux measurements found in literature over the last 50 years only gave an out-of-equilibrium Tg since the enthalpy is continuous at T*g without visible heat jump...|$|E

40|$|International audienceNano/micro ceramic-filled epoxy {{composite}} materials have been processed with various percentage additions of SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 ceramic fillers as reinforcements {{selected from the}} nano and micro origin sources. Different types of filler combinations, viz. only nano, only micro, nano/micro, and micro/micro particles, were designed to investigate their influence on the thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, and dielectric properties of epoxy polymers. Thermal expansion studies were conducted using thermomechanical analysis that revealed a two-step expansion pattern consecutively before and after <b>vitreous</b> <b>transition</b> temperatures. The presence of micro fillers have shown <b>vitreous</b> <b>transition</b> temperature in the range 70 - 80 °C {{compared with that of}} nano structured composites in which the same was observed as ~ 90 °C. Similarly, the bulk thermal conductivity is found to increase with increasing percentage of micron-size Al 2 O 3. It was established that the addition of micro fillers lead to epoxy {{composite materials}} that exhibited lower thermal expansion and higher thermal conductivity compared with nano fillers. Moreover, nano fillers have a significantly decisive role in having low bulk dielectric permittivity. In this study, epoxy composites with a thermal expansion coefficient of 2. 5 × 10 5 /K, thermal conductivity of 1. 18 W/m* K and dielectric permittivity in the range 4 - 5 at 1 kHz have been obtained. The study confirms that although the micro fillers seem to exhibit good thermal conductivity and low expansion coefficient, the nano-size ceramic fillers are candidate as cofillers for low dielectric permittivity. However, a suitable proportion of nano/micro-mixed fillers is necessary for achieving epoxy composites with promising thermal conductivity, controlled coefficient of thermal expansion and dielectric permittivity.

40|$|Epoxy resin is a {{material}} that offers excellent impermeability to humidity, electric insulation, resistance to solvents and chemical reagents along with very good adhesive abilities. In {{order to obtain}} those specific abilities, it reacts chemically with a hardening mean, resulting {{in the development of}} a cross linking network. The materials that arise from the preceding procedure exhibit high <b>vitreous</b> <b>transition</b> temperature, thermosetting, and therefore are remarkably fragile. To counteract this specific disadvantage the addition of modifiers within the polymeric network of the resin was proposed, such as elastomers and thermoplastic materials with lower <b>vitreous</b> <b>transition</b> temperature, in our case study polyethylene oxide (PEO), without though altering its particular characteristics. Mixing occurs with the formation of hydrogen bonds between PEO and Epoxy resin. Initially, the thermal behavior of the materials was studied using the method of Differential Calorimetric Scan. Specifically, the temperature of glass transition was detected, along to its dependency on the change of the concentration of the polymeric mixture components. To study the dielectric properties of materials, such as local motions, interactions at the molecular level, insulating behavior and conductivity phenomena, the dielectric spectroscopy methods DRS and TSDC have been used. The interaction of the material with water, the change of its dielectric properties along with the water influx and efflux were also studied. In summary, mixtures of DGEBA / MDA / PEO studied fully miscible, which was confirmed by all methods of study. The properties of materials change with increasing the addition of PEO, while significant differences in morphology observed for materials with> 40 % PEO. So the percentage of PEO ~ 30 % of the specimens retain the properties of the resin, while the temperature of glass transition is reduced thus increasing the flexibility and the ability to edit. Increasing the PEO at higher rates has led to the crystalline phase and from this point onwards there are variations in the cross linking network which reduces. It shall therefore, question the good resistance, while since the critical point and then increases the hydration ability limited the adhesive properties. ...|$|E
40|$|Wetting and {{sticking}} of soda-lime glass on {{two types of}} stainless steel {{as well as on}} platinum and vitreous carbon substrates are studied in a neutral gas atmosphere between 860 and 1200 ◦C.

Sticking is investigated by measuring the temperature of glass drop detachment from the substrate during cooling below the <b>vitreous</b> <b>transition</b> temperature. Characterization of substrate and glass surfaces after separation is carried out using surface profilometry, atomic-force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy.

The arsenic atoms are three coordinated for all glassy compositions. However, for L 2 and L 3 line glasses we observed an evolution of the Debye-Waller factor around these atoms, whereas this parameter is constant for L 1 line glasses. This is explained by the existence of As-As homopolar bonds in L 1 line glasses that block the structure. The same behaviour is observed for the surroundings of the silver atoms. The <b>vitreous</b> <b>transition</b> temperature and the electrical characteristics are reported and analyzed relatively to the structural results. The ternary chalcogenide glasses based on the Ag-As-Se and Ag-As-S systems are good ionic conductors, with silver as mobile cation [I].

The flours produced contain proteins, starches, lipids, organic substances containing phenol groups, and high percentages of unsaturated fatty acids. Films produced from the illpa variety presented lower water vapor permeability and larger Young&# 8217;s modulus values than the films formed from the cupi variety. Both films were yellowish and displayed a high light blocking ability (as compared with polyethylene films), which {{can be attributed to}} the presence of phenolic compounds.
