5|$|As the {{cochlear}} duct’s mesenchyme begins to differentiate, three cavities are formed: the scala vestibuli, the scala tympani and the scala media. Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani contain an extracellular fluid called perilymph. The scala media contains endolymph. A set of membranes called the <b>vestibular</b> membrane and the basilar membrane develop to separate {{the cochlear}} duct from the <b>vestibular</b> duct and the tympanic duct, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble {{assumption is}} {{also consistent with}} the accidental production of arterial bubbles. One scenario considers a shunt at the heart or lung level that passes bubbles from the venous to the arterial side. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is thought to only open in certain conditions. A PFO conveniently explains neurological accidents after recreational air diving without any procedure violation, but it does not explain <b>vestibular</b> hits in deep diving. <b>Vestibular</b> symptoms can appear very early in the decompression, long before the massive bubble production required to overload the system.|$|E
5|$|The vestibulo{{cochlear}} nerve (VIII) splits into the <b>vestibular</b> and cochlear nerve. The <b>vestibular</b> part {{is responsible for}} innervating the vestibules and semicircular canal of the inner ear; this structure transmits information about balance, and {{is an important component}} of the vestibuloocular reflex, which keeps the head stable and allows the eyes to track moving objects. The cochlear nerve transmits information from the cochlea, allowing sound to be heard.|$|E
5|$|Similarly {{to other}} Brazilian public universities, admissions to {{undergraduate}} programs are through a comprehensive general examination, called <b>vestibular.</b> While other Brazilian public universities, specially federally managed ones, which use the National High School Exam (ENEM, in Portuguese Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio) as an entrance exam, Unicamp {{has its own}} national entrance exam applied yearly by its <b>Vestibular</b> Commission (COMVEST, in Portuguese Comissão Permanente para os Vestibulares) in two rounds. Generally, the first round happens in November and is a test composed of 90 multiple-choice general knowledge questions. Students applying to programs that require specific skills (such as music, architecture, dance, and others) must take a specific knowledge test even before the first phase.|$|E
5|$|The {{smallest}} region, the flocculonodular lobe, {{is often}} called the vestibulocerebellum. It is the oldest part in evolutionary terms (archicerebellum) and participates mainly in balance and spatial orientation; its primary connections are with the <b>vestibular</b> nuclei, although it also receives visual and other sensory input. Damage to this region causes disturbances of balance and gait.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle receives input from afferent fibers from the <b>vestibular</b> nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from the inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the <b>vestibular</b> nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory input from the inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.|$|E
5|$|Jackson had to {{reschedule}} nine dates on {{the first}} leg of the tour due to <b>vestibular</b> migraines. However, on November 4, 2008, Jackson canceled 7 of the 9 shows which had been rescheduled, citing schedule conflicts as the main reason. On November 19, it was announced on Japanese newspapers and websites that Jackson will bring the tour to Japan for a series of five shows in Saitama, Nagoya, Osaka, and Fukuoka in February 2009. However, all five dates were canceled.|$|E
5|$|The deep nuclei of the {{cerebellum}} are {{clusters of}} gray matter lying {{within the white}} matter {{at the core of}} the cerebellum. They are, with the minor exception of the nearby <b>vestibular</b> nuclei, the sole sources of output from the cerebellum. These nuclei receive collateral projections from mossy fibers and climbing fibers as well as inhibitory input from the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. The four nuclei (dentate, globose, emboliform, and fastigial) each communicate with different parts of the brain and cerebellar cortex. (The globose and the emboliform nuclei are also referred to as combined in the interposed nucleus). The fastigial and interposed nuclei belong to the spinocerebellum. The dentate nucleus, which in mammals is much larger than the others, is formed as a thin, convoluted layer of gray matter, and communicates exclusively with the lateral parts of the cerebellar cortex. The flocculonodular lobe is the only part of the cerebellar cortex that does not project to the deep nuclei—its output goes to the <b>vestibular</b> nuclei instead.|$|E
5|$|The new {{university}} {{was created by}} law on December 28, 1962, but effective functioning begun in 1966. Before that, only the School of Medicine functioned. In April 1963 the first <b>vestibular,</b> the general admissions exam, happened, with 1,592 candidates competing for 50 spots in the medicine program. The first lecture in the newly created University of Campinas took place on May 20 of the same year. By 1965, the organizing commission for the new university started looking for a location for a new campus.|$|E
5|$|These direct pain inputs, {{as well as}} {{indirect}} inputs, {{are thought}} to induce long-term pain avoidance behavior that results in chronic posture changes and consequently, in functional and anatomical remodeling of <b>vestibular</b> and proprioceptive nuclei. As a result, chronic neuropathic pain can induce macroscopic anatomical remodeling of the hindbrain, including the cerebellum. The magnitude of this remodeling and the induction of neuron progenitor markers suggest the contribution of adult neurogenesis to these changes.|$|E
5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the <b>vestibular</b> system. One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced otolith rests on the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result {{in the perception of}} vertigo.|$|E
5|$|Path {{integration}} in mammals {{makes use of}} the <b>vestibular</b> organs, which detect accelerations in the three dimensions, together with motor efference, where the motor system tells {{the rest of the}} brain which movements were commanded, and optic flow, where the visual system signals how fast the visual world moves past the eyes. Information from other senses such as echolocation and magnetoreception may also be integrated in certain animals. The hippocampus is {{the part of the brain}} that integrates linear and angular motion to encode a mammal's relative position in space.|$|E
5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the <b>vestibular</b> duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain of}} Allosaurus, as {{interpreted}} from spiral CT scanning of an endocast, was {{more consistent with}} crocodilian brains {{than those of the}} other living archosaurs, birds. The structure of the <b>vestibular</b> apparatus indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the inner ear was like that of a crocodilian, and so Allosaurus probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The olfactory bulbs were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors, although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small.|$|E
5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity {{of the middle ear}} by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the <b>vestibular</b> system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|Mossy fibers {{enter the}} {{granular}} layer from their points of origin, many {{arising from the}} pontine nuclei, others from the spinal cord, <b>vestibular</b> nuclei etc. In the human cerebellum, {{the total number of}} mossy fibers has been estimated at about 200 million. These fibers form excitatory synapses with the granule cells and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Within the granular layer, a mossy fiber generates a series of enlargements called rosettes. The contacts between mossy fibers and granule cell dendrites take place within structures called glomeruli. Each glomerulus has a mossy fiber rosette at its center, and up to 20 granule cell dendritic claws contacting it. Terminals from Golgi cells infiltrate the structure and make inhibitory synapses onto the granule cell dendrites. The entire assemblage is surrounded by a sheath of glial cells. Each mossy fiber sends collateral branches to several cerebellar folia, generating a total of 20–30 rosettes; thus a single mossy fiber makes contact with an estimated 400–600 granule cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed <b>vestibular</b> component as well, which implies a good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement. Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{a complex}} structure, containing external and internal components. It consists of the glans (including the frenulum of clitoris, which is a frenulum on the under-surface of the glans and is created by the two medial parts of the labia minora), the clitoral body (which is composed of two erectile bodies known as the corpora cavernosa), two clitoral crura, the clitoral hood (formed by the labia minora) and the <b>vestibular</b> or clitoral bulbs. The clitoral body is {{commonly referred to as}} the shaft (or internal shaft), while the length of the clitoris between the glans and the body may also be referred to as the shaft (or external shaft) because, like the shaft as a whole, it supports the glans, and its shape can be seen and felt through the clitoral hood.|$|E
5|$|While the {{selection}} process is need-blind and race-blind, most of the best high schools and preparatory schools in Brazil are private and very expensive, and represent a majority of admissions in Brazilian public universities, leading to increased inequality in the country. To remedy this, Unicamp introduced in 2004 the Social Inclusion and Affirmative Action Program (PAAIS, in Portuguese Programa de Ação Afirmativa e Inclusão Social) that allows high schoolers coming from public schools to receive a bonus score in their overall <b>vestibular</b> score. While not focused on racial and ethnical factors, over the years, the PAAIS initiative has {{increased the number of}} admission of minorities from public high school, especially black and native-Brazilians, historically the most economical and social fragile groups in Brazil. With this program, around 30% of admissions come from public schools, and the participation of minorities increased from 10% to around 30%.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>vestibular</b> {{conditions}} {{that should be}} excluded include <b>vestibular</b> paroxysmia, recurrent unilateral vestibulopathy, <b>vestibular</b> schwannoma, or a tumor of the endolymphatic sac.|$|E
25|$|Nonsynaptic plasticity, can {{function}} {{to alleviate the}} effects of brain damage. When one of the <b>vestibular</b> nerves is damaged, disparity in the firing rates of neurons in the <b>vestibular</b> nuclei causes unnecessary <b>vestibular</b> reflexes. The symptoms of this damage fade over time. This is likely due to modifications of intrinsic excitability in the neurons of the <b>vestibular</b> nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Varying <b>vestibular</b> system {{stimulation}} has {{an effect}} on place cells. The <b>vestibular</b> system, part of the labyrinth of the inner ear, {{plays an important role in}} spatial memory by tuning into self-motion such as acceleration. Bilateral lesions of the <b>vestibular</b> system in patients cause abnormal firing of hippocampal place cells as evidenced, in part, by difficulties with aforementioned spatial tasks such as the radial arm maze and the Morris water navigation task. The dysfunction in spatial memory seen with damage to the <b>vestibular</b> system is lasting and possibly permanent, particularly if there is bilateral damage. For example, spatial memory deficits of patients with chronic <b>vestibular</b> loss is seen 5–10 years after a complete loss of the bilateral <b>vestibular</b> labyrinths.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{includes}} balance retraining exercises (<b>vestibular</b> rehabilitation). The exercises include {{movements of}} the head and body specifically developed for the patient. This form of therapy is thought to promote habituation, adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, and/or sensory substitution. <b>Vestibular</b> retraining programs are administered by professionals with knowledge and understanding of the <b>vestibular</b> system and its relationship with other systems in the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} {{of making the}} right <b>vestibular</b> diagnosis {{is reflected in the}} fact that in some populations, more than one third of the patients with a <b>vestibular</b> disease consult more than one physician – in some cases up to more than fifteen.|$|E
25|$|Dysequilibrium {{arising from}} {{bilateral}} loss of <b>vestibular</b> function – such as can occur from ototoxic {{drugs such as}} gentamicin – can also be treated with balance retraining exercises (<b>vestibular</b> rehabilitation) although the improvement {{is not likely to}} be full recovery.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{stimulation}} of the <b>vestibular</b> cortex.|$|E
25|$|Bilateral <b>vestibular</b> schwannomas are {{diagnostic}} of NF2.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vestibular</b> {{migraine}} is {{the association}} of vertigo and migraines {{and is one of}} the most common causes of recurrent, spontaneous episodes of vertigo. The cause of <b>vestibular</b> migraines is currently unclear; however, one hypothesized cause is that the stimulation of the trigeminal nerve leads to nystagmus in individuals suffering from migraines.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to close}} {{proximity}} of the structures, <b>vestibular</b> lesioning often results in cochlear damage, which in turn results in hearing impairments. Hearing {{has been shown to}} affect place cell functioning, therefore, spatial deficits could be in part due to damage to the cochlea. However, animals with a removed eardrum (usually causing the inability to hear) and normal <b>vestibular</b> labyrinths perform significantly better than animals with eardrums and lesioning in the <b>vestibular</b> labyrinths. These findings suggest that disruption to hearing is not the primary cause of the observed spatial memory deficits.|$|E
25|$|The {{neurochemistry}} {{of vertigo}} includes six primary neurotransmitters {{that have been}} identified between the three-neuron arc that drives the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Glutamate maintains the resting discharge of the central <b>vestibular</b> neurons, and may modulate synaptic transmission in all three neurons of the VOR arc. Acetylcholine appears to function as an excitatory neurotransmitter in both the peripheral and central synapses. Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) {{is thought to be}} inhibitory for the commissures of the medial <b>vestibular</b> nucleus, the connections between the cerebellar Purkinje cells, and the lateral <b>vestibular</b> nucleus, and the vertical VOR.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that the <b>vestibular</b> system of mammals has retained some of its ancestral acoustic sensitivity and that this sensitivity is mediated by the otolithic organs (most likely the sacculus, due to its anatomical location). In mice lacking the otoconia of the utricle and saccule, this retained acoustic sensitivity is lost. In humans <b>vestibular</b> evoked myogenic potentials occur in response to loud, low frequency acoustic stimulation in patients with sensorineural hearing loss. <b>Vestibular</b> sensitivity to ultrasonic sounds has also been hypothesised {{to be involved in the}} perception of speech presented at artificially high frequencies, above the range of the human cochlea (~18kHz). In mice sensation of acoustic information via the <b>vestibular</b> system has been demonstrated to have a behaviourally relevant effect; response to an elicited acoustic startle reflex is larger in the presence of loud, low frequency sounds that are below the threshold for the mouse cochlea (~4Hz), raising the possibility that the acoustic sensitivity of the <b>vestibular</b> system may extend the hearing range of small mammals.|$|E
25|$|C. Greater <b>vestibular</b> gland, and {{immediately}} above it the urethra.|$|E
25|$|Three other neurotransmitters work centrally. Dopamine may {{accelerate}} <b>vestibular</b> compensation. Norepinephrine modulates {{the intensity}} of central reactions to <b>vestibular</b> stimulation and facilitates compensation. Histamine is present only centrally, but its role is unclear. Dopamine, histamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine are neurotransmitters thought to produce vomiting. It is known that centrally acting antihistamines modulate the symptoms of acute symptomatic vertigo.|$|E
25|$|Vertigo*, {{better known}} as <b>vestibular</b> disease* in dogs, is an {{uncommon}} condition in older dogs. Most cases are idiopathic, {{but it can also}} be caused by otitis interna, or inner ear infection, tumors, and encephalitis. Signs include nystagmus, head tilt, circling, vomiting, and falling to one side. Idiopathic <b>vestibular</b> disease will usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.|$|E
25|$|The NIDCD {{supports}} {{research to}} develop new tests and refine current tests of balance and <b>vestibular</b> function. For example, NIDCD scientists have developed computer-controlled systems to measure eye movement and body position by stimulating specific parts of the <b>vestibular</b> and nervous systems. Other tests to determine disability, {{as well as new}} physical rehabilitation strategies, are under investigation in clinical and research settings.|$|E
25|$|The <b>vestibular</b> {{system is}} {{the region of the}} inner ear where the semicircular canals converge, close to the cochlea. The <b>vestibular</b> system works with the visual system to keep objects in view when the head is moved. Joint and muscle receptors are also {{important}} in maintaining balance. The brain receives, interprets, and processes the information from all these systems to create the sensation of balance.|$|E
