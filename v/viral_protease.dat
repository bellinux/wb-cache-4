5|$|Apart from {{attempts}} to control {{the spread of the}} Aedes mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop antiviral drugs that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications. Discovery {{of the structure of the}} viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, it may be possible to develop specific inhibitors of the <b>viral</b> <b>protease</b> (coded by NS3), which splices viral proteins. Finally, it may be possible to develop entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ capping process, which is required for viral replication.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} {{is focused on}} small-molecule inhibitors of the <b>viral</b> <b>protease,</b> RNA polymerase and other nonstructural genes. Two agents — Boceprevir by Merck and Telaprevir by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc—both inhibitors of NS3 protease were approved for use on May 13, 2011 and May 23, 2011 respectively.|$|E
25|$|When rhesus macaques {{were given}} interferon-α2b and {{ribavirin}} and exposed to MERS, they developed less pneumonia than control animals. Five critically ill people with MERS in Saudi Arabia with ARDS and on ventilators were given interferon-α2b and ribavirin but all ended up dying of the disease. The treatment was started late in their disease (a mean of 19 days after hospital admission) {{and they had}} already failed trials of steroids so {{it remains to be}} seen whether it may have benefit earlier in the course of disease. Another proposed therapy is inhibition of <b>viral</b> <b>protease</b> or kinase enzymes. Researchers are investigating a number of ways to combat the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, including using interferon, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir, as well as other agents such as mycophenolic acid and camostat.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>viral</b> <b>proteases</b> cleave off part of eIF4G, that {{contains}} the eIF4E binding region. This {{has the effect of}} preventing most cellular mRNAs from binding eIF4G; however, a few cellular mRNAs with IRESs still translate under these conditions.|$|R
25|$|The single-strand RNA is {{tightly bound}} to p7 nucleocapsid proteins, late {{assembly}} protein p6, and enzymes {{essential to the}} development of the virion, such as reverse transcriptase and integrase. Lysine tRNA is the primer of the magnesium-dependent reverse transcriptase. The nucleocapsid associates with the genomic RNA (one molecule per hexamer) and protects the RNA from digestion by nucleases. Also enclosed within the virion particle are Vif, Vpr, Nef, and <b>viral</b> <b>protease.</b> A matrix composed of an association of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid, ensuring the integrity of the virion particle. This is in turn surrounded by an envelope of host-cell origin. The envelope is formed when the capsid buds from the host cell, taking some of the host-cell membrane with it. The envelope includes the glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, which are responsible for binding to and entering the host cell.|$|E
25|$|Like {{protease}} inhibitors, bevirimat {{and other}} maturation inhibitors interfere with protease processing of newly translated HIV polyprotein precursor, called gag. Gag {{is an essential}} structural protein of the HIV virus. Gag undergoes a chain of interactions both with itself and with other cellular and viral factors to accomplish the assembly of infectious virus particles. HIV assembly is a two-stage process involving an intermediate immature capsid that undergoes a structurally dramatic maturation to yield the infectious particle. This alteration is mediated by the <b>viral</b> <b>protease,</b> which cleaves the Gag polyprotein precursor, allowing the freed parts to reassemble to form {{the core of the}} mature virus particle. Bevirimat prevents this viral replication by specifically inhibiting cleavage of the capsid protein (CA) from the SP1 spacer protein. First, bevirimat enters a growing virus particle as it buds from an infected cell and binds to the Gag polypeptide at the CA/SP1 cleavage site. This prevents the protease enzyme from cleaving CA-SP1. As the capsid protein remains bound to SP1, the virus particle core is prevented from compressing into its normal mature shape, which is crucial for infectivity, resulting in the release of an immature, non-infectious particle.|$|E
500|$|The {{final step}} of the viral cycle, {{assembly}} of new HIV-1 virions, begins at the plasma membrane of the host cell. The Env polyprotein (gp160) goes through the endoplasmic reticulum and is transported to the Golgi complex where it is cleaved by furin resulting in the two HIV envelope glycoproteins, gp41 and gp120. [...] These are transported to the plasma membrane of the host cell where gp41 anchors gp120 to the membrane of the infected cell. The Gag (p55) and Gag-Pol (p160) polyproteins also associate with the inner surface of the plasma membrane along with the HIV genomic RNA as the forming virion begins to bud from the host cell. The budded virion is still immature as the gag polyproteins {{still need to be}} cleaved into the actual matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid proteins. This cleavage is mediated by the packaged <b>viral</b> <b>protease</b> and can be inhibited by antiretroviral drugs of the protease inhibitor class. The various structural components then assemble to produce a mature HIV virion. Only mature virions are then able to infect another cell.|$|E
5000|$|... eIF4F is {{important}} for recruiting the small ribosomal subunit (40S) to the 5' cap of mRNAs during cap-dependent translation initiation. Components of the complex are also involved in cap-independent translation initiation; for instance, certain <b>viral</b> <b>proteases</b> cleave eIF4G to remove the eIF4E-binding region, thus inhibiting cap-dependent translation.|$|R
50|$|Protease inhibitors (PIs) are a {{class of}} {{antiviral}} drugs that are widely used to treat HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C. <b>Protease</b> inhibitors prevent <b>viral</b> replication by selectively binding to <b>viral</b> <b>proteases</b> (e.g. HIV-1 protease) and blocking proteolytic cleavage of protein precursors that are necessary {{for the production of}} infectious viral particles.|$|R
50|$|HCV is a positive-sense {{single-stranded}} RNA {{virus that}} has been demonstrated to replicate in the hepatocytes of both humans and chimpanzees. A single HCV polyprotein is translated, and then cleaved by cellular and <b>viral</b> <b>proteases</b> into three structural proteins (core, E1, and E2) and seven nonstructural proteins (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B).|$|R

Examples of HIV protease inhibitors are lopinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir and ritonavir. Darunavir and atazanavir are currently recommended as first line therapy choices. Maturation inhibitors have a similar effect by binding to gag, but development of two experimental drugs in this class, bevirimat and vivecon, was halted in 2010.

40|$|Infected {{cells can}} undergo {{apoptosis}} as a protective response to viral infection, thereby limiting viral infection. As viruses require a viable cell for replication, {{the death of}} the cell limits cellular functions that are required for virus replication and propagation. Picornaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that modify the host cell apoptotic response, probably in order to promote viral replication, largely {{as a function of the}} <b>viral</b> <b>proteases</b> 2 A, 3 C, and 3 CD. These proteases are essential for viral polyprotein processing and also cleave cellular proteins. Picornavirus proteases cleave proapoptotic adaptor proteins, resulting in downregulation of apoptosis. Picornavirus proteases also cleave nucleoporins, disrupting the orchestrated manner in which signaling pathways use active nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, including those involved in apoptosis. In addition to <b>viral</b> <b>proteases,</b> the transmembrane 2 B protein alters intracellular ion signaling, which may also modulate apoptosis. Overall, picornaviruses, via the action of virally encoded proteins, exercise intricate control over and subvert cell death pathways, specifically apoptosis, thereby allowing viral replication to continue...|$|R

50|$|The large ORF of segment A {{consists}} of 3069 nucleotides. The UTRs are characterized as 107-bp on 5’ side and 157-bp on 3’ end. The start codons {{can be at}} either position 102, or two codons downstream at position 108. However, the initiation codon starts at the 108-bp. The translation of the large ORF transcript produces a 114-kDa polyprotein. The mature VP4 protein, <b>viral</b> <b>protease,</b> assists this process to increase the processing of the polyprotein to generate preVP2 capsid protein, VP3 viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP), and additional VP4 proteins. In addition VP3 proteins can associate with pre-VP2 as a structural protein and with VP1 {{to function as a}} transcriptional activator.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the double β-barrel core, some <b>viral</b> <b>proteases</b> (such as TEV protease) have a long, [...] C-terminal loop that forms a lid that completely covers the substrate and create a binding tunnel. This tunnel contains a set of tight binding pockets such that each side chain of the substrate peptide (P6 to P1’) is bound in a complementary site (S6 to S1’) and specificity is endowed by the large contact area between enzyme and substrate. Conversely, cellular proteases that lack this loop, such as trypsin have broader specificity.|$|R
25|$|Specificity is endowed by {{the large}} contact area between enzyme and substrate.

40|$|Drug {{resistance}} {{is a major}} problem in quickly evolving diseases, including the human immunodeficiency (HIV) and hepatitis C viral (HCV) infections. The <b>viral</b> <b>proteases</b> (HIV protease and HCV NS 3 / 4 A protease) are primary drug targets. At the molecular level, drug resistance reflects a subtle change in the balance of molecular recognition; the drug resistant protease variants are no longer effectively inhibited by the competitive drug molecules but can process the natural substrates with enough efficiency for viral survival. Therefore, the inhibitors that better mimic the natural substrate binding features should result in more robust inhibitors with flat drug resistance profiles. The native substrates adopt a consensus volume when bound to the enzyme, the substrate envelope. The most severe resistance mutations occur at protease residues that are contacted by the inhibitors outside the substrate envelope. To guide the design of robust inhibitors, we investigate the shared and varied properties of substrates with the protein dynamics taken into account to define the dynamic substrate envelope of both <b>viral</b> <b>proteases.</b> The NS 3 / 4 A dynamic substrate envelope is compared with inhibitors to detect the structural and dynamic basis of resistance mutation patterns. Comparative analyses of substrates and inhibitors result in a solid list of structural and dynamic features of substrates that are not shared by inhibitors.
