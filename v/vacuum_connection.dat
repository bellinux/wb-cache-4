40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to: (1) Explain the ALS vacuum policy and specifications for beamlines and experiment endstations. (2) Provide guidelines related to ALS vacuum policy to assist in designing beamlines which are in accordance with ALS vacuum policy. This document supersedes LSBL- 116. The Advanced Light Source is a third generation synchrotron radiation source whose beam lifetime depends {{on the quality of}} the vacuum in the storage ring and the connecting beamlines. The storage ring and most of the beamlines share a common vacuum and are operated under ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) conditions. All endstations and beamline equipment must be operated so as to avoid contamination of beamline components, and must include proper safeguards to protect the storage ring vacuum from an accidental break in the beamline or endstation vacuum systems. The primary gas load during operation is due to thermal desorption and electron/photon induced desorption of contaminants from the interior of the vacuum vessel and its components. The desorption rates are considerably higher for hydrocarbon contamination, thus considerable emphasis is placed on eliminating these sources of contaminants. All vacuum components in a beamline and endstation must meet the ALS vacuum specifications. The vacuum design of both beamlines and endstations must be approved by the ALS Beamline Review Committee (BRC) before <b>vacuum</b> <b>connections</b> to the storage ring are made. The vacuum design is first checked during the Beamline Design Review (BDR) held before construction of the beamline equipment begins. Any deviation from the ALS vacuum specifications must be approved by the BRC prior to installation of the equipment on the ALS floor.

The analysis indicates that the resulting design is significantly heavier than previous design due to the increased diameter of the system, resulting in greater tank and vacuum enclosure weights. Additional weight is also required {{in the area where}} the payload is attached to the pointing system in order to provide additional stiffness to the payload. The vacuum shell required to enclose the instrument is shorter and therefore an attendant reduction in instrument package weight would be expected. The primary resonance of the cooler instrument package occurs at 21 Hz, a mode in which the flexibility of the vacuum shell allows motion of the cryogen tank and instrument, and which can be increased by additional stiffening in the region of the pointing system <b>vacuum</b> shell <b>connection</b> at the cost of additional weight.

50|$|The {{train was}} screw-coupled; each {{carriage}} was first coupled by a loose chain and hook coupling to the next; the slack on this was then {{taken up by}} a turnbuckle screw arrangement, until the buffers of the two carriages were touching. To uncouple, there needed to be some slack in the coupling; as the train had stopped all the couplings were under tension. Once the <b>vacuum</b> brake <b>connection</b> to the rear portion was broken, any attempt to introduce slack into the coupling between the two portions would be defeated by the rear portion settling back to rest its weight upon the rear van brakes. To assist uncoupling the front van guard therefore scotched one of {{the wheels of the}} sixth vehicle, that is, the front vehicle of the rear portion being detached. Loosening the turnbuckle thus transferred the weight of the rear portion to the scotch on the sixth vehicle, rather than to the rear van brakes.

This wavefunction is given as a product of the delta functions of the SU(2) field strength and therefore it can be naturally associated to a flat connection spacetime.

In contrast to the usual scattering, the incident wave {{is not a single}} plane wave but the certain superposition of plane waves of the same energy and various directions, for example, a convergent conical wave. The wave function close to the Coulomb center is determined by a cusp caustic which is probed by de Broglie waves.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) vacuum is studied using the formalism of Lattice QCD. To this end, a new smearing algorithm is designed to reveal the long-distance non-perturbative {{structure of}} the vacuum, over-improved stout-link smearing. After showing how to quantitatively select {{the value of the}} over-improvement parameter є, we demonstrate the topological stability provided by the new algorithm. A comparison is made between the topological charge density from over-improved stout-link smearing and the topological density from the massless overlap Dirac operator. A good correspondence is observed. We also demonstrate an excellent correlation between the location of Dirac zeromodes and the gluonic topological charge density from smearing. The dependence of the overlap operator on the input negative Wilsonmass regulator parameter is also analysed through calculations of the topological charge density. Following this, we examine the {{structure of the}} QCD vacuum at different energy scales. At short distances an oscillating sheet-like structure is seen, whilst at longer scales the more established instanton dominated <b>vacuum</b> appears. The <b>connection</b> between these two pictures is discussed. Of particular interest is how dynamical sea quarks affect the vacuum structure. We show how these extra degrees of freedom lead to “rougher” gauge fields containing a greater number of non-trivial topological structures, and explain the physics behind this observation. The use of smearing as a preconditioner for Maximal Centre Gauge fixing is also examined through an analysis of the centre vortex content of the vacuum. We conclude our analysis of QCD vacuum structure by considering the effects of smearing on the overlap quark propagator. At heavy quark masses, the mass and wave renormalisation functions of the quark propagator are greatly altered, whilst for lighter quark masses the effects are not as strong. Of particular note is the suppression of localised topological structures, giving rise to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. Lastly, the non-perturbative effects of dynamical sea-quarks are examined through calculations of the proton and Δ⁺ charge radii and magnetic moments using a nonperturbative clover-improved fermion action. The results are compared with earlier quenched calculations. The chiral curvature of the μΔ⁺/μp ratio at light quark masses, observed in the previous calculations, is suppressed in our dynamical calculation. Thesis (Ph. D.)
