40|$|Abstract. Applying electroosmosis to sludge {{dewatering}} practically, methods for improving electroosmotic dewatering must be explored. The influence of initial pH, adding Al 2 (SO 4) 3 dose and ash content in sludge on electroosmotic dewatering behavior was investigated. The {{results show that}} acid or alkaline environment is unfavorable for electroosmotic dewatering, especially initial pH of sludge closing to the isoelectric point, electroosmotic dewatering behaves worst. With increasing Al 2 (SO 4) 3 coagulant-aid dose, the decreasing rate of water content becomes slower gradually during electroosmotic dewatering. Besides, higher ash content in sludge has a better effect on <b>vaccum</b> filtration, but slightly impact on electroosmotic dewatering. When ash content increases to 69. 9 % from 52. 4 %, final water content reduces to 64. 3 % from 78. 3 % using <b>vaccum</b> filtration, and the decreasing amount of water content by electroosmotic dewatering ranges from 16. 5 % to 12. 3 %...|$|E

The size of zeolite was 10 - 20 mesh {{and used as}} solid phase in column chromatography with length of 30 cm. The first step of the research was coal pyrolisis and the product (tar) was distillated by fractional column and <b>vaccum</b> system at reduced pressure 44 cmHg and maximum temperature at 200 oC.

Each fraction was then analyzed by gas chromatography. The results showed, zeolite have a capability to separate the compounds of tar and it tends to absorb medium hydrocarbon. The nonpolar eluent [CCl 4] gives the better result in eluting tar compound than polar (ethanol) or medium polar eluents (acetone).   Keywords: zeolite, coal tar, column chromatograph...|$|E
