25|$|The first common {{application}} of wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors was in large telephone exchanges, to reduce relay hash (noise) on the 48 volt DC power supply. The development of AC-operated domestic radio receivers {{in the late}} 1920s created a demand for large-capacitance (for the time) and high-voltage capacitors for the <b>valve</b> <b>amplifier</b> technique, typically at least 4 microfarads and rated at around 500 volts DC. Waxed paper and oiled silk film capacitors were available, but devices with that order of capacitance and voltage rating were bulky and prohibitively expensive.|$|E
500|$|Butterworth {{filters are}} an {{important}} class of filters due to Stephen Butterworth (1930) which are now recognised as being a special case of Cauer's elliptic filters. Butterworth discovered this filter independently of Cauer's work and implemented it in his version with each section isolated from the next with a <b>valve</b> <b>amplifier</b> which made calculation of component values easy since the filter sections could not {{interact with each other}} and each section represented one term in the Butterworth polynomials. This gives Butterworth the credit for being both the first to deviate from image parameter theory and the first to design active filters. It was later shown that Butterworth filters could be implemented in ladder topology without the need for amplifiers. [...] Possibly the first to do so was William Bennett (1932) in a patent which presents formulae for component values identical to the modern ones. Bennett, at this stage though, is still discussing the design as an artificial transmission line and so is adopting an image parameter approach despite having produced what would now be considered a network synthesis design. He also {{does not appear to be}} aware of the work of Butterworth or the connection between them.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1950s {{the vast}} {{majority}} of high-quality <b>valve</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> and almost all higher-power <b>valve</b> <b>amplifiers</b> have been of the push-pull type.|$|R
2500|$|Vacuum-tube {{amplifiers}} (also {{known as}} tube <b>amplifiers</b> or <b>valve</b> <b>amplifiers)</b> use a vacuum tube as the active device. While semiconductor amplifiers have largely displaced <b>valve</b> <b>amplifiers</b> for low-power applications, <b>valve</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{can be much}} more cost effective in high power applications such as radar, countermeasures equipment, and communications equipment. Many microwave amplifiers are specially designed <b>valve</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> such as the klystron, gyrotron, traveling wave tube, and crossed-field amplifier, and these microwave valves provide much greater single-device power output at microwave frequencies than solid-state devices. Vacuum tubes remain in use in some high end audio equipment, {{as well as in}} musical instrument amplifiers, due to a preference for [...] "tube sound".|$|R
50|$|Broadband <b>valve</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{typically}} use class A1 or AB1.|$|R
2500|$|Other early {{customers}} included Pete Townshend and John Entwistle of The Who, whose {{search for}} extra volume led Marshall {{to design the}} classic 100-watt <b>valve</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Ken Bran and Dudley Craven, Marshall's developers, doubled the number of output valves, added a larger power transformer and an extra output transformer. Four of these amplifiers were built and delivered to Pete Townshend, and the Marshall Super Lead Model 1959, the original Plexi, was born in 1965. At the request of Pete Townshend, Marshall produced an 8×12-inch cabinet (soon replaced {{by a pair of}} 4×12-inch cabinets) on top of which the 1959 amplifier head was placed, giving rise to the Marshall stack, an iconic image for rock and roll. The size of the wall of Marshall stacks [...] "soon became an indicator of the band's status", even when rendered obsolete by improved PA systems; indeed, many of the [...] "ridiculously huge arrays of heads and cabs" [...] included dummies. Still, most modern 100-watt heads have roots in Marshall's design, even though they often contain many more features (or different tubes, such as the more American-sounding 6L6 tubes).|$|E

5000|$|Historically, <b>valve</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{were often}} used a class-A power <b>amplifier</b> simply because <b>valves</b> {{are large and}} expensive; many class-A designs use only a single device.|$|R

50|$|Vacuum tube or {{electronic}} <b>valve</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{were first}} used to resolve microphone impedance and output problems. Bell Labs invented the condenser microphones in 1917 and {{this type of}} microphone went through many stages of improvement. Because of the invention of <b>valve</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> the production of simple moving coil mics like the Western designed 630A “8 Ball” became possible. This dynamic microphone {{went on to become}} one of the mainstays of American microphone production. In this period valves were also then incorporated internally into microphones and valve microphones were hence commercially available.|$|R
50|$|When <b>valve</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{were the}} norm, SETs more-or-less {{disappeared}} from western products except for low-power designs (up to 5 watts), with push-pull indirectly heated triodes or triode-connected valves such as EL84 becoming the norm.|$|R
50|$|Valve preamplifiers use triodes or low-noise pentodes (EF86). Mains hum {{from the}} heater {{filaments}} {{is a potential}} problem in low-level <b>valve</b> stages. Modern <b>amplifiers</b> invariably run from the mains; as there is little need to minimise costs in expensive <b>valve</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> the heater supply is often rectified and even regulated to reduce hum to an absolute minimum.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} year, Jensen and Pridham {{applied for}} a patent for what they called their [...] "Sound Magnifying Phonograph". Over {{the next two years}} they developed their first <b>valve</b> <b>amplifier.</b> In 1919 this was standardized as a 3-stage 25 watt amplifier.|$|E
50|$|The Mullard 5-10 was {{a circuit}} for a <b>valve</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{designed}} by the British valve company, Mullard in 1954 at the Mullard Applications Research Laboratory (ARL) in Mitcham Surrey UK, part of the New Road factory complex, {{to take advantage of}} their particular products. The circuit was first published in Practical Wireless magazine.|$|E
50|$|A Williamson {{amplifier}} {{refers to}} a type of vacuum tube (<b>valve)</b> <b>amplifier</b> whose circuit design uses the same principles as a design published by D.T.N. Williamson. Williamson proposed the standard which became generally accepted as the target figure for high-quality audio power amplifiers, for less than 0.1% total harmonic distortion at full rated power output.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>valve</b> <b>amplifiers</b> use the {{single-ended}} triode (SET) topology {{that uses}} the gain device in class A. SETs are extremely simple and have low parts count. Such amplifiers are expensive because of the output transformers required.|$|R
50|$|Only class A {{can be used}} in {{single-ended}} mode, as part of {{the signal}} would otherwise be cut off. The driver stage for class AB2 and B <b>valve</b> <b>amplifiers</b> must be capable of supplying some signal current to the power valve grids ("driving power").|$|R
50|$|Mainstream modern {{loudspeakers}} give good {{sound quality}} in a compact size, but {{are much less}} power-efficient than older designs and require powerful amplifiers to drive them. This makes them unsuitable for use with <b>valve</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> particularly lower-power single-ended designs. <b>Valve</b> hi-fi power <b>amplifier</b> designs since the 1970s have had to move mainly to class AB1 push-pull (PP) circuits. Tetrodes and pentodes, sometimes in ultra-linear configuration, with significant negative feedback, are the usual configuration.|$|R
