A top-down rapid prototyping approach with commercial computer-aided design tools and field-programmable logic devices (FPLDs) is used for laboratory projects. Students begin with traditional transistor–transistor logic-based projects containing a few gates and progress to designing a simple 16 -bit computer, using <b>very</b> <b>high-speed</b> integrated circuits hardware description language (VHDL) synthesis tools and an FPLD. To help motivate students, the simple computer design is programmed to control a small autonomous robot with two servo drive motors and several sensors. The laboratory concludes with a team-based design project using the robot.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{present the}} method to {{efficiently}} detect TCP port scans in <b>very</b> <b>high-speed</b> links. The main {{idea of this}} method is to discard most of the handshake packets without loss in accuracy. With two Bloom filters that track active destinations and TCP handshakes, the algorithm can easily discard about 80 % of all handshake packets with negligible loss in accuracy. This significantly reduces both the memory requirements and CPU cost. Next, I present my own extension of this algorithm, which significantly reduces the number of false positives caused {{by the lack of}} communication from the server to the client. Finally, I evaluated this algorithm using packet traces and live traffic from CESNET. The result showed that this method requires less than 2 MB to accurately monitor <b>very</b> <b>high-speed</b> links, which perfectly fits in the cache memory of today's processors...|$|R
