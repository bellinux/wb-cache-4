50|$|Cultured marble countertops are {{man made}} <b>vanity</b> <b>tops</b> {{that have the}} {{appearance}} of and resemble real stone marble. Cultured marble countertops are made by mixing high strength polyester resin and real marble stone dust. The combination is then formulated with additional chemicals and poured into a cast mold. These molds can ultimately produce bathtubs, whirlpool decks, shower pans, window sills, and even <b>vanity</b> <b>tops.</b> The finished material is significantly less expensive than natural marble and four times stronger than natural stones such as granite or marble. The process of using a mold also allows the fabricated countertops to have features such as different surface textures and {{a vast array of}} colors which natural stone can not. Cultured marble countertops are aesthetically pleasing and a more economical and durable alternative to real stone marble.|$|R
50|$|In a {{residential}} setting, solid surface {{can be used}} as kitchen countertops, bathroom <b>vanity</b> <b>tops,</b> and shower and tub surrounds. Countertop fabricators typically join solid surface sheets into desired shapes using a two-part adhesive, after which the cured joint is machined flat. The same method is used to build up edge thickness, which can be profiled using tools and techniques similar to those used to work hardwoods.|$|R

50|$|Blocking, {{often called}} backing or {{sometimes}} grounds, also refers to {{pieces of wood}} or other material that run between wall studs {{in order to provide}} support and attachment sites for mounted hardware or trim such as cabinets, shelving, handrails, <b>vanity</b> <b>tops</b> without a cabinet underneath, bathroom towel bars, mouldings etc. Properly installed blocking is easier to find and use for attaching wall hardware than studs alone. Once drywall, or any other material, covers the wall {{it can be difficult to}} find 2x4 studs for attachment, and the position of nails and screws must be adjusted to stud location. Thus, if blocking is installed at a uniform and predetermined height, attachment sites can be found without using a stud finder, and the blocking can be utilized anywhere along a wall at that height. This is particularly useful for installing upper cabinets in kitchens or bathrooms as they tend to be fairly heavy and finding appropriate studs for installation can be difficult.|$|R

2500|$|Stone (usually granite) countertops and {{bathroom}} vanities both involve a finished slab of stone, usually polished but sometimes with another finish (such as honed or sandblasted). Industry standard thicknesses in the United States are 3/4" [...] (2cm) and 1.25" [...] (3cm). Often 2cm slabs will be laminated {{at the edge}} to create {{the appearance of a}} thicker edge profile. The slabs are cut to fit the top of the kitchen or bathroom cabinet, by measuring, templating or digital templating. Countertop slabs are commonly sawn from rough blocks of stone by reciprocating gangsaws using steel shot as abrasive. More modern technology utilizes diamond wire saws which use less water and energy. Multi-wire saws with as many as 60 wires can slab a block in less than two hours. The slabs are finished (i.e., polished, honed), then sealed with resin to fill micro-fissures and surface imperfections typically due to the loss of poorly bonded elements such as biotite. The fabricators shop cuts these slabs down to final size and finishes the edges with equipment such as hand-held routers, grinders, CNC equipment, or polishers. In 2008, concerns were raised regarding radon emissions from granite countertops; the National Safety Council states that the contributions of radon to inside air come from the soil and rock around the residence (69%), the outdoor air and the water supply (28%), and only 2.5% from all building materials-including granite countertops. [...] A concerned homeowner can employ ASTM radon mitigation and removal techniques. [...] The stone for countertops or vanities is usually granite, but often is marble (especially for <b>vanity</b> <b>tops),</b> and is sometimes limestone or slate. The majority of the stone for this application is produced in Brazil, Italy, and China.|$|R
