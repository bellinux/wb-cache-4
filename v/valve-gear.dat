Overhead the dark and bulky cylinders cut against the reflected glimmer on the skylights; below, <b>valve-gear</b> and connecting-rod flashed across the gloom, and the twinkling cranks spun in their shallow pit. One saw the big columns shake and strain as the crosshead shot up and down; the thrust-blocks groaned with the back push of the propeller.|$|E

50|$|Absolute {{synchronism}} {{has been}} enabled for the combustion cycle. The <b>valve-gear</b> and the ignition gear {{for the low}} tension igniters are adjustable and the lift of the valves and the firing moment of each igniter may be adjusted while the engine is running.|$|E
5000|$|John Gray was the {{locomotive}} superintendent from 1840-1845. His designs {{such as the}} [...] "Star" [...] and [...] "Vesta" [...] were fitted with variable expansion <b>valve-gear,</b> and his engines on the railway represent {{some of the earliest}} examples of counterweighting of wheel rims on locomotives.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, renewed {{interest}} in airships, which spawned the Empire Airship programme, also encouraged development of engines to power the airships with. The Sikh III was one of these; closely following the Sikh in construction, major differences included two inlet valves instead of three and enclosed <b>valve-gear.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first {{locomotive}} of the class, No.2001 Cock o' the North, {{was introduced}} in 1934. It was built at Doncaster Works, with Lentz-type rotary-cam actuated poppet <b>valve-gear</b> supplied by the Associated Locomotive Equipment Company, and a double-chimney Kylchap exhaust, each chimney using four nozzle blastpipes. The chimney system was designed to take different fittings to allow experimentation with exhaust arrangements.|$|E
50|$|A {{successor}} to the C11, the C15 had a completely redesigned frame and 250 cc engine. The bike proved to need careful maintenance, being prone to oil leaks, electrical faults, gearbox problems, <b>valve-gear</b> failures, a weak big-end, and clutch adjustment problems.Initially, the contact breaker housing protruded {{at the rear of}} the cylinder above the gearbox, but was later relocated to the right-side crankcase, accessed via a circular plate.|$|E
50|$|A Heron {{cylinder}} head, {{or simply}} Heron head, is a {{design for the}} combustion chambers of the cylinder head on an internal combustion piston engine. The head is machined flat, with recesses only for inlet and exhaust valves, spark plugs, injectors and so on. The combustion chamber itself is contained within a dished depression {{in the top of}} the piston. The Heron head is suitable for petrol and diesel engines, for ohv and ohc <b>valve-gear,</b> and for small and large engine displacement capacities.|$|E
5000|$|In 1938, Bulleid gained {{approval}} {{to build the}} Merchant Navy class of modern 4-6-2 [...] "Pacifics", undoubtedly inspired by Gresley but also drawing on his experiences from across Europe {{and with all the}} most modern equipment: a partially welded boiler and firebox rather than traditional rivetted designs, thermic syphons and a high-pressure boiler. It also included chain-driven <b>valve-gear</b> immersed in an oil bath, a feature that was controversial and later caused problems if not maintained properly, which was difficult, due to conditions, after WW2.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1920s large {{airships}} were in favour again, so Coatalen revised the Sikh and developed the Sunbeam Sikh III for the R100 and R101 airship families. Retaining the bore, stroke and {{displacement of the}} earlier engine, detail refinements included five valves per cylinder and enclosed <b>valve-gear.</b> The Sikh III was displayed at the 1929 Olympia Aero Show, generating interest due to its large size, weight and power. After the R101 disaster the large Empire airships were abandoned, and the airship market for Sunbeam engines disappeared for a second time, leaving the Sikh III with no orders.|$|E
5000|$|Joy's <b>valve-gear</b> {{was used}} {{extensively}} on Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and London and North Western Railway locomotives, {{and also on}} the Manning Wardle-built narrow gauge 2-6-2 locomotives of the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway. Joy gear was also used by John Fowler & Co. and several other steam traction engine manufacturers. The most numerous locomotive class using Joy valve gear was Russian O class, in Od and OD variants (over 4500 built) - a letter [...] "d" [...] / [...] "D" [...] in their designations stood for Joy (in Russian phonetically: Джой - Dzhoy). Joy's valve gear {{was used in the}} Doble steam car until replaced by Stephenson's valve gear.|$|E
50|$|The VFR800 was {{the first}} non-JDM {{motorcycle}} to use VTEC <b>valve-gear.</b> Honda used VTEC to meet tightening noise and emissions standards and to increase the peak engine horsepower.Based on the VTEC-E system, the simplified motorcycle version of VTEC employs {{only two of the}} four valves per cylinder when operating at lower engine speeds. All four valves per cylinder are engaged above approximately 6,800 rpm. This is initiated by an electronically actuated oil spool valve, which send oil pressure to the lifter actuators, which then move the engagement pins into place above the valve stem, allowing the remaining two valves to open. This design allows for variable valve timing as well, since the cam lobe profiles can be made different. After much criticism of the abruptness of power transition, Honda lowered the VTEC activation rpm threshold to 6,400 rpm in 2006. The VTEC disengages two cylinder valves when the engine speed drops again below 6,100 rpm.|$|E
50|$|The 2.5 diesel, 2.5 petrol and Diesel Turbo engines all {{shared the}} same block {{castings}} and other components such as <b>valve-gear</b> and cooling system parts, allowing them to be built on the same production line. The Diesel Turbo produced , a 13% increase over the naturally aspirated unit, and a 31.5% increase in torque to 150 lbft Nm at 1800 rpm. Externally, turbo-diesel vehicles differed from other models only by having an air intake grille in the left-hand wing to supply cool air to the turbo. The engine was adopted as the standard engine for UK and European markets. Early turbo-diesel engines gained a reputation for poor reliability, with major failures to the bottom-end and cracked pistons. A revised block and improved big end bearings were introduced in 1988, and a re-designed breather system in 1989. These largely solved the engine's problems, but it remained (like many early turbo-diesels) prone to failure if maintenance was neglected.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents an}} improved lumped-parameter model that combines favorably its simplicity and precision to represent appropriately an automotive <b>valve-gear</b> system, {{by means of}} the inclusion of a fluidic pressure element within the modeling of the hydraulic lifter, and by considering the hysteretic behavior of the pushrod under cyclic loading. Realistic values have been chosen for the parameters of this cam-follower mechanical system, and the checking of this modified mathematical model has been accomplished by means of a qualitative comparison with other models previously conceived, and with previous experimental results obtained from an automobile engine. The digital computer simulation allows the determination of the cam speed for which the valve toss occurs, whose value is of fundamental importance in evaluating the design of automotive cam mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Present engines for {{passenger}} cars and motorcycles {{are the result}} of a centenarian technological evolution, however experience proves that a long time often elapses before an available new solution is adopted, even if it leads to significant improvements of engine characteristics. Conversely, due to the need of excellent performance and to less severe cost limitations, racing engines and former aeroplane reciprocating engines of {{the first decades of the}} century are characterised by early adoption of advanced solutions. Many solutions for mass-production engines (four-valve cylinder head, overhead camshaft, fuel injection, supercharging), before becoming of large use, were first employed in engines for aeroplanes or for racing road-vehicles. The decline of reciprocating engines in the aeronautic field after the Second World War has excluded them from the primogeniture of the most modern solutions, leaving this role to racing engines. At present, the increasing divergence between racing and normal engines, due to the endless growth of specific power of the former ones and to more and more severe limits of exhaust emissions and fuel consumption for the latter ones, might lead to the conclusion that transfers of technology have become impossible. Fortunately, this is not the case. Many solutions of present racing engines will beneficial for mass production engines of the near future. For example, the special <b>valve-gear</b> design and the very large bore-to-stroke ratio, conceived to allow the very high rotation speeds of present Formula 1 engines, are key solutions for a possible valved two-stroke GDI engine, directed to mass production. Moreover, advantageous exchanges of technology, rather than one-way transfers, occur in some cases, mainly regarding injection and ignition systems...|$|E
