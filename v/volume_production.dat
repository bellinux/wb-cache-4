5|$|Electrolysis of {{a mixture}} of {{beryllium}} fluoride and sodium fluoride was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the alkali metals. Early in the 20th century, the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of beryllium iodide was investigated following {{the success of a}} similar process for the production of zirconium, but this process proved to be uneconomical for <b>volume</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{consists of}} the high pressure injection of the raw material into a mould which shapes the polymer into the desired shape. Moulds can be of a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity moulds, each cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle. Moulds are generally made from tool steels, but stainless steels and aluminium moulds are suitable for certain applications. Aluminium moulds are typically ill-suited for high <b>volume</b> <b>production</b> or parts with narrow dimensional tolerances, as they have inferior mechanical properties and {{are more prone to}} wear, damage, and deformation during the injection and clamping cycles; however, aluminium moulds are cost-effective in low-volume applications, as mould fabrication costs and time are considerably reduced. Many steel moulds are designed to process well over a million parts during their lifetime and can cost {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to fabricate.|$|E

25|$|In engines {{having more}} than two rotors, or two rotor race engines {{intended}} for high-rpm use, a multi-piece eccentric shaft may be used, allowing additional bearings between rotors.

25|$|Billet Steel: When a {{high quality}} {{camshaft}} or low <b>volume</b> <b>production</b> is required, engine builders and camshaft manufacturers choose steel billet. This {{is a much more}} time consuming process, and is generally more expensive than other methods. However, the finished product is far superior. CNC lathes, CNC milling machines, and CNC camshaft grinders will be used during production. Different types of steel bar can be used, one example being EN40b. When manufacturing a camshaft from EN40b, the camshaft will also be heat treated via gas nitriding, which changes the micro-structure of the material. It gives a surface hardness of 55-60 HRC. These types of camshafts can be used in high-performance engines.|$|E

This Cell configuration has one PPE on the core, with eight physical SPEs in silicon. In the PlayStation 3, one SPE is locked-out during the test process, a practice which helps to improve manufacturing yields, and another one is reserved for the OS, leaving 6 free SPEs {{to be used by}} games' code.

25|$|Iron is also {{corroded}} {{much more}} easily in seawater than lead, and would need some form of protection to prevent rusting. Alloys of stainless steel are more resistant to corrosion, but, for the cheaper grades, need to be rinsed with freshwater after use to prevent corrosion in storage. The cost of shaping alternative materials may be considerably greater, particularly for small quantities. Stainless steel and tungsten dive weights for example are currently only obtainable by milling down a solid metal stock material in block or cylinder form, into the required shape. Direct casting of these materials in a foundry is possible, but would require high <b>volume</b> <b>production</b> for the casting processes to be cost effective.|$|E
30|$|For {{regulatory}} testing, {{the decision}} on waiving of testing can be proposed by the registrant {{and has to be}} justified. The final decision on acceptance of the waiving is decided by the regulatory body. For chemical substances under REACH information requirement is triggered by their <b>production</b> <b>volume.</b> Four different ranges of <b>production</b> <b>volumes</b> per year are agreed on for which ecotoxicity data are required: 1 to < 10 t/a; 10 to < 100 t/a; 100 to < 1000 t/a; 1000 t/a and more). Chemicals with a high <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> have to be tested more comprehensively than chemicals with a lower <b>production</b> <b>volume.</b> For chemicals with low <b>production</b> <b>volumes,</b> only aquatic tests are requested whereas for chemicals with high <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> additionally terrestrial and sediment tests are required. In the presented test strategy for ENMs, only one threshold value based on one, rather low <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> is intended. This value still has to be defined. ENMs with <b>production</b> <b>volumes</b> exceeding this threshold value have to be comprehensively tested addressing endpoints in the three compartments: water, sediment and soil. Also ENMs with a lower <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> than the threshold can be toxic to the environment. Therefore, two scenarios have to be considered. For low volume ENMs with bulk material of known ecotoxicity, comprehensive investigation has to be performed. For low volume ENMs where no bulk material is available, the bulk material shows no ecotoxicity, or ecotoxicity of the ENMs is expected due to their physico-chemical properties, a screening test has to be performed. If toxic effects are detected in the screening test, comprehensive testing has to be performed.|$|R

25|$|Mauritius’s local sugar plantations, {{devastated by}} the {{emancipation}} of the slaves, were given a new lifeline {{with the establishment of}} the Immigration Depot. The high number of indentured laborers passing through the facility, to be transported to the various territories of the British Empire, proved to be an endless supply stream of cheap labor. In the period of 183460, 290,000 Indian laborers arrived. The pool of labor proved to be so large that, for the next 67 years, indentured contracts were limited to only one year. This sugar revolution led to an increase in <b>volume</b> <b>production,</b> making Mauritius the most important sugar-producing British colony, its sugar export accounting for 7.4 percent of the world's total production by the 1850s.|$|E
500|$|The first <b>volume</b> <b>production</b> of {{mechanical}} filters was undertaken by Collins Radio Company {{starting in the}} 1950s. These were originally designed for telephone frequency-division multiplex applications where there is commercial advantage in using high quality filters. Precision and steepness of the transition band leads to a reduced width of guard band, which in turn leads {{to the ability to}} squeeze more telephone channels into the same cable. [...] This same feature is useful in radio transmitters for much the same reason. [...] Mechanical filters quickly also found popularity in VHF/UHF radio intermediate frequency (IF) stages of the high end radio sets (military, marine, amateur radio and the like) manufactured by Collins. [...] They were favoured in the radio application because they could achieve much higher Q-factors than the equivalent LC filter. [...] High Q allows filters to be designed which have high selectivity, important for distinguishing adjacent radio channels in receivers. [...] They also had an advantage in stability over both LC filters and monolithic crystal filters. The most popular design for radio applications was torsional resonators because radio IF typically lies in the 100 to 500kHz band.|$|E

Monash University, Melbourne uses PEDOT as a cathode. A 2011 published study doi: 10.1021/ja1112904 documented the first metal-free electrocatalyst using relatively inexpensive doped carbon nanotubes, which are less than 1% the cost of platinum and are of equal or superior performance. A recently published article demonstrated how the environmental burdens change when using carbon nanotubes as carbon substrate for platinum.|$|E
