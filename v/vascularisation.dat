25|$|Internally, {{the lateral}} nasal wall is {{supplied}} with blood by the sphenopalatine artery (from behind and below) {{and by the}} anterior ethmoid artery and the posterior ethmoid artery (from above and behind).

These three (3) vascular supplies to the internal nose converge in the Kiesselbach plexus (the Little area), which is a region in the anteroinferior-third of the nasal septum, (in front and below). Furthermore, the nasal vein <b>vascularisation</b> of the nose generally follows the arterial pattern of nasal <b>vascularisation.</b> The nasal veins are biologically significant, {{because they have no}} vessel-valves, and because of their direct, circulatory communication to the sinus caverns, which makes possible the potential intracranial spreading of a bacterial infection of the nose.

25|$|It is {{possible}} that the increased expression of Eph in cancer plays several roles, first, by acting as survival factors or as a promoter of abnormal growth. The angiogenic properties of the Eph system may increase <b>vascularisation</b> of and thus growth capacity of tumors. Second, elevated Eph levels may disrupt cell-cell adhesion via cadherin, known to alter expression and localisation of Eph receptors and ephrins, which is known to further disrupt cellular adhesion, a key feature of metastatic cancers. Third, Eph activity may alter cell matrix interactions via integrins by the sequestering of signaling molecules following Eph receptor activation, as well as providing potential adherence via ephrin ligand binding following metastasis.|$|E
25|$|The surgeon replaces missing {{parts with}} tissue of like quality and quantity; nasal lining with mucosa, {{cartilage}} with cartilage, bone with bone, and skin with skin that best match the native skin color and skin {{texture of the}} damaged nasal subunit. For such surgical repairs, skin flaps are preferable to skin grafts, because skin flaps generally are the superior remedy for matching the color and the texture of nasal skin, better resist tissue contracture, and provide better <b>vascularisation</b> of the nasal skeleton; thus, when there is sufficient skin to allow tissue harvesting, nasal skin is the best source of nasal skin. Furthermore, despite its notable scarring propensity, the nasal skin flap is the prime consideration for nasal reconstruction, because of its greater verisimilitude.|$|E
25|$|Angiogenesis may be {{a target}} for combating {{diseases}} characterized by either poor <b>vascularisation</b> or abnormal vasculature.

The presence of blood vessels where there should be none may affect the mechanical properties of a tissue, increasing the likelihood of failure. The absence of blood vessels in a repairing or otherwise metabolically active tissue may inhibit repair or other essential functions. Several diseases, such as ischemic chronic wounds, are the result of failure or insufficient blood vessel formation and may be treated by a local expansion of blood vessels, thus bringing new nutrients to the site, facilitating repair. Other diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, may be created by a local expansion of blood vessels, interfering with normal physiological processes.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} {{currently}} little evidence to support this (and mounting evidence to refute it), some early studies implicated the Ephs to {{play a part in}} the signaling of limb development.

This expression is seen in the distal end of the limb buds, where cells are still undifferentiated and dividing, and appears to be under the regulation of retinoic acid, FGF2, FGF4, and BMP-2 – known to regulate limb patterning. EphA4 defective mice do not present abnormalities in limb morphogenesis (personal communication between Andrew Boyd and Nigel Holder), so it is possible that these expression patterns are related to neuronal guidance or <b>vascularisation</b> of the limb with further studies being required to confirm or deny a potential role of Eph in limb development.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{to modern}} cetaceans, such as whales and {{dolphins}}, ichthyosaurs were air-breathing. Whales and dolphins are mammals and warm-blooded. Of ichthyosaurs it was traditionally assumed {{that they were}} cold-blooded, being reptiles. However, since the 1970s many dominant reptile groups of the Mesozoic, such as theropod dinosaurs, pterosaurs and plesiosaurs, have been considered warm-blooded, as this offers an elegant explanation of their dominance. Some direct evidence is available that ichthyosaurs too might have been endothermic. In 1990, Vivian de Buffrénil published a histological study, indicating that ichthyosaurs possessed a fibrolamellar bone structure, as with warm-blooded animals in general, typified by fast growth and a strong <b>vascularisation.</b> Early Triassic species already show these traits. In 2012, {{it was reported that}} even the very basal form Utatsusaurus had this bone type, indicating that the ancestors of ichthyosaurs were already warm-blooded. Additional direct proof for a high metabolism is the isotopes of oxygen ratio in the teeth, which indicates a body temperature of between 35 – 39°C, about 20° higher than the surrounding seawater.|$|E

50|$|<b>Vascularisation</b> of {{the scalp}} and {{forehead}} is {{supplied by the}} supraorbital, supratrochlear, superficial temporal, postauricular and occiptal vessels. All these vessels are lined vertically and permit safe and effective transfer of the forehead flap on multiple individual vascular pedicles. The pedicle is the anatomic part that resembles the stem of the flap. The perfusion of the paramedian forehead flap comes from three sources: randomly, through the frontalis muscle and through the supratrochlear artery. Because the forehead flap is an axial flap with a pedicle containing its dominant vessel, the pedicle can safely be narrowed to 1 to 1.2 cm.|$|E

50|$|Activating TRAbs are {{characteristic}} of Graves' disease (autoimmune hyperthyroidism). TPO antibody is measured more easily than the TSH receptor antibody, and so is often used as a surrogate in the diagnosis of Graves' disease. These antibodies activate adenylate cyclase by binding to the TSH receptor. This causes the production of thyroid hormones and subsequent growth and <b>vascularisation</b> of the thyroid. TRAbs are also useful in the diagnosis of Graves' Ophthalmopathy. Although the exact mechanism of how TRAbs induce Graves' Ophthalmopathy is unknown, {{it is likely that}} the antibodies bind to TSH receptors in retro-orbital tissues, causing infiltration of lymphocytes. This inflammatory response leads to cytokine production that causes fibroblasts to produce glycosaminoglycans, leading to ophthalmopathy.|$|E
50|$|The IGF-1R is {{implicated in}} several cancers, {{including}} breast, prostate, and lung cancers. In some instances its anti-apoptotic properties allow cancerous cells {{to resist the}} cytotoxic properties of chemotherapeutic drugs or radiotherapy. In breast cancer, where EGFR inhibitors such as erlotinib {{are being used to}} inhibit the EGFR signaling pathway, IGF-1R confers resistance by forming one half of a heterodimer (see the description of EGFR signal transduction in the erlotinib page), allowing EGFR signaling to resume {{in the presence of a}} suitable inhibitor. This process is referred to as crosstalk between EGFR and IGF-1R. It is further implicated in breast cancer by increasing the metastatic potential of the original tumour by conferring the ability to promote <b>vascularisation.</b>|$|E

50|$|Increasingly, vaginally {{administered}} estrogens {{based on}} low dose of estriol {{are used to}} stimulate the vaginal epithelium proliferation. There is growing {{evidence to support the}} use of both Fractional Erbium and Fractional CO2 laser therapy, both have proven to be an effective treatment strategy, especially for patients such as cancer survivors for whom vaginal estrogen is not always an option. The characteristic of both Erbium and CO2 laser wavelengths is that they are highly absorbed within water. It is the water within the sub mucosa that is targeted by the laser. The hypothesised mode of action for Erbium laser is that through selectively heating the submucosa a process of neocollagenesis and neo <b>vascularisation</b> occurs. This can lead to an improvement of the blood flow and overall health of the treated area. Treatments take approximately 20 minutes and can be performed within an outpatient setting.|$|E

50|$|In stage II, {{treatment}} {{should be}} aimed at preventing the development of corneal ulcers and promoting the healing of epithelial lesions. In addition to artificial tears, topical antibiotics may also be prescribed to prevent possible infections. Patients should be monitored very carefully since, being the disease poorly symptomatic, the corneal damage may progress without the patient noticing any worsening of the symptoms. Corneal contact lenses {{can also be used}} in this stage of the disease, for their protective action to improve corneal healing21.In the most severe forms (stage III), it is necessary to stop the progression towards corneal perforation: in these cases, a possible surgical treatment option is tarsorrhaphy, i.e. the temporary or permanent closure of the eyelids by means of sutures or botulinum toxin injection. This protects the cornea, although the aesthetic result of these procedures may be difficult to accept for patients. Similarly, a procedure that entails the creation of a conjunctival flap {{has been shown to be}} effective in the treatment of chronic corneal ulcers with or without corneal perforation22. In addition, another viable therapeutic option is amniotic membrane graft, which has recently been shown to play a role in stimulating corneal epithelium healing and in reducing <b>vascularisation</b> and inflammation of the ocular surface 23. Other approaches used in severe forms include the administration of autologous serum eye drops24.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of elasmobranchs are viviparous and show {{a wide range}} of strategies to provide their offspring with nourishment and respiratory requirements. Some sharks simply retain their young in the dilated posterior segment of the oviduct. In its simplest form, the uterus does not provide any additional nutrients to the embryos. However, other elasmobranchs develop secretory uterine villi that produce histotroph, a nutrient which supplements the yolk stores of the oocyte. Uterine secretions are perhaps most advanced in the stingrays. Following depletion of the yolk, the uterine lining hypertrophies into secretory appendages termed [...] "trophonemata". The process by which the uterine secretions (also known as uterine milk or histotroph) are produced resembles that of breast milk in mammals. Furthermore, the milk is rich in protein and lipid. As the embryo grows, <b>vascularisation</b> of the trophonemata enlarges to form sinusoids that project out to the surface to form a functional respiratory membrane. In lamnoid sharks, following yolk use, the embryos develop teeth and eat eggs and siblings within the uterus. There is usually one fetus per uterus and it grows to enormous proportions of up to 1.3 m in length. In placental sharks, the yolk sac is not withdrawn to become incorporated into the abdominal wall. Rather, it lengthens to form an umbilical cord and the yolk sac becomes modified into a functional epitheliochorial placenta.|$|E
30|$|Contrast-enhanced {{computed}} tomography (CE-CT) delivers other parameters connected to <b>vascularisation.</b> Contrast enhancement {{is influenced by}} both <b>vascularisation</b> and the extravascular space and can be easily quantified [14].

30|$|DWI {{can be used}} in {{extension}} to histology and other imaging modalities. The evaluation of <b>vascularisation</b> in tumours can be improved if different methods are used in combination. ADCdiff, ADCperf, MVD, and other methods detect correlated characteristics of <b>vascularisation</b> in tumours. The low, but significant, correlation between MVD and maximal ADCperf supports the idea that both parameters are influenced by <b>vascularisation</b> properties. The reason for the comparatively weak correlation might be that both parameters are influenced by different aspects of <b>vascularisation.</b> MVD is predominantly influenced by the existence of vessels (which do not necessarily have to be well perfused), whereas the ADCperf is mainly influenced by the level of perfusion (which is not necessarily linked to the existence of intact vessel walls).|$|E

40|$|Smoking {{increases}} the risk of pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion and low birth weight (LBW). By cigarette smoke exposure (gestational day, GD 3 - 17), normal-litter-size pregnancy with low birth weight (NP-LBW) and small-litter-size pregnancy with normal birth weight (SP-NBW) in rats were induced. The placental weight in SP-NBW was twice the weight of the normal in contrast with the smaller placenta in NP-LBW. Compared with the normal, placental efficiency (expressed as fetus-to-placenta weight ratio) and placental <b>vascularisation</b> were significantly decreased in smoke exposed placentas with more obvious decrease in SP-NBW. For NP-LBW, decreased placental <b>vascularisation</b> was due to decreased labyrinth <b>vascularisation</b> which was caused by both decreased number density and diameter of fetal capillary. For SP-NBW, decreased placental <b>vascularisation</b> was due to reduced proportion of labyrinth in placenta and decreased labyrinth <b>vascularisation</b> which was caused by decreased fetal capillary number density. Real time RT-PCR analysis showed a tendency for decreased placental mRNA level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin- 1 (Ang 1) and tyrosine kinase receptor- 2 (Tie 2) in NP-LBW(P< 0. 1), and the tendency became obvious in SP-NBW(P< 0. 05). A tendency for decreased placental mRNA level of fms-like tyrosine kinase- 1 (Flt 1) and angiopoietin- 2 (Ang 2) was also observed in SP-LBW(P< 0. 1).

40|$|<b>Vascularisation</b> is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} greatest challenges in tissue engineering. Different strategies exist but cell-based approaches have emerged as a promising therapy to achieve successful <b>vascularisation.</b> The use of endothelial cells to engineer vascularised tissues has been extensively investigated. This field of research has evolved with the discovery of endothelial progenitor cells, a subpopulation with a high regenerative potential. However, the survival of endothelial cell populations alone seems to be impaired. To overcome this problem, co-culture systems, involving supporting cells, like mural cells, fibroblasts, or more tissue-specific cells have been developed. Endothelial cells benefit from the extracellular matrix components and growth factors produced by the supporting cells, which results in neovessel stabilisation and maturation.
