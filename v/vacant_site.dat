5|$|After World War II, the <b>vacant</b> <b>site</b> of {{the former}} synagogue {{was used as a}} {{makeshift}} volleyball court. The volleyball court made way for a prefabricated department store building, constructed in 1959. The department store was completely destroyed in a fire on December 31, 1980, and was subsequently dismantled. Despite some earlier ideas about a permanent department store building on the same spot, and a 1977 architecture competition for its design, no construction took place. Instead, the parcel was turned into a parking lot, which it remains to this day.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} in the 20th century was that the acts of demolition were often acts of desperation and last resort; a demolished house could not be valued for probate duty. A <b>vacant</b> <b>site</b> was attractive to property developers, who would pay a premium for an empty site that could be rebuilt upon and filled with numerous small houses and bungalows, which would return a quick profit. This was especially true {{in the years immediately}} following World War II, when Britain was desperate to replace the thousands of homes destroyed. Thus, in many cases, the demolition of the ancestral seat, strongly entwined with the family's history and identity, followed the earlier loss of the family's London house.|$|E

25|$|Nabarro–Herring creep is {{strongly}} temperature dependent. For lattice diffusion of atoms {{to occur in}} a material, neighboring lattice sites or interstitial sites in the crystal structure must be free. A given atom must also overcome the energy barrier to move from its current site (it lies in an energetically favorable potential well) to the nearby <b>vacant</b> <b>site</b> (another potential well). The general form of the diffusion equation is D = D0exp(E/KT) where D0 has a dependence on both the attempted jump frequency {{and the number of}} nearest neighbor sites and the probability of the sites being vacant. Thus there is a double dependence upon temperature. At higher temperatures the diffusivity increases due to the direct temperature dependence of the equation, the increase in vacancies through Schottky defect formation, and an increase in the average energy of atoms in the material. Nabarro–Herring creep dominates at very high temperatures relative to a material's melting temperature.|$|E
50|$|These {{were the}} days of Government insistence on industrialised system building. The absence of large <b>vacant</b> <b>sites</b> led Lambeth to adopt a policy of {{surgical}} interventions. Working under Hollamby, George Finch pioneered an architecture that created slim point blocks inserted on tight sites but always with communal provision at the base.|$|R
40|$|Theory of {{dilution}} {{effect in}} orbital ordered system is presented. The $e_g$ orbital model without spin {{degree of freedom}} and the spin-orbital coupled model in a three-dimensional simple-cubic lattice are analyzed by the Monte-Carlo simulation and the cluster expansion method. In the $e_g$ orbital model without spin degree of freedom, reduction of the orbital ordering temperature due to dilution is steeper than that in the dilute magnet. This is attributed to a modification of the orbital wave-function around <b>vacant</b> <b>sites.</b> In the spin-orbital coupled model, {{it is found that}} magnetic structure is changed from the A-type antiferromagnetic order into the ferromagnetic one. Orbital dependent exchange interaction and a sign change of this interaction around <b>vacant</b> <b>sites</b> bring about this novel phenomena. Present results explain the recent experiments in transition-metal compounds with orbital dilution. Comment: 12 pages, 16 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} spontaneous oscillation of photoluminescence (PL) {{intensity in}} an ensemble of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), which {{differs from the}} fluorescence intermittency of a single QD, is investigated. The PL intensity in a QD dispersion slowly oscillates with time under continuous illumination. The oscillatory behavior is found to vary with changing QD concentration, solvent viscosity, volume fraction of irradiated region, and irradiation intensity. On {{the basis of the}} Gray-Scott model [Chemical Oscillation and Instabilities: Non-linear Chemical Kinetics (Clarendon, Oxford, 1994); J. Phys. Chem. 89, 22 (1985); Chem. Eng.

500|$|After {{the siege}} Henry III ordered the castle to be {{dismantled}} and labourers {{filled in the}} ditches and halved {{the height of the}} stone walls. William de Beauchamp was forbidden to rebuild the castle, and instead built an unfortified house in the inner bailey. St Paul's and St Cuthbert's churches were rebuilt in 1224 using stone from the castle. The sudden availability of cheap stone led to the repaving of many of the town streets in Bedford in 1224. Local tradition suggests that the first stone bridge at Bedford, the Great Bridge, was built using stone from the castle. By 1361 the castle site was described as [...] "a void plot of old enclosed by walls" [...] and seems to have been derelict for most of the medieval period. The antiquarian John Leland visited the site in the 16th century, and noted that the castle was [...] "now clean down". The early 17th century mapmaker John Speed produced a map of Bedford in 1611, showing the motte and a fragment of bailey wall still standing on an otherwise <b>vacant</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} plan was for eight platforms, but half were {{designated as a}} [...] "possible future extension" [...] {{and the cost of}} building the GCML was greater than expected. The line leading to the station cut through [...] of middle-class housing, including the Eyre Estate in St John's Wood and the area around Lord's, drawing protests and requiring a relocation of the track and station facilities. There was never enough money for the extra platforms, and only four were built, three inside the train shed and one to its west (platform 4). As a result, the concourse is unusually long and had three walls for most of the 20th century. The northern wall was missing, as the GCR anticipated that the other four platforms, under an extended train shed, would be built later on. An office block was later built on the <b>vacant</b> <b>site.</b> The cost of the London Extension meant that the adjoining Great Central Hotel, designed by Sir Robert William Ellis, was built by a different company. The hotel operated for a relatively short time and was converted to offices in 1945, becoming the headquarters of British Rail from 1948 to 1986. The offices were restored as a hotel in 1993.|$|E

The low value of n obtained in this study suggests that the sorption of Pb(II) on nanofibre composites was very fast.|$|R

Henry IV recommenced {{the construction of the}} Pont Neuf, started by Henry III in 1578, but left unfinished during the wars of religion. It was finished between 1600 and 1607. It was the first Paris bridge built without houses. Instead, it was uncovered and equipped with sidewalks. Near the bridge, he built [...] "La Samaritaine" [...] (1602–1608), a large pumping station which provided drinking water as well as water for the gardens of the Louvre and the Tuileries. To the south of the <b>vacant</b> <b>site</b> of the former royal residence of Henry II, the Hôtel des Tournelles, he built an elegant new residential square surrounded by brick houses and an arcade. It was built between 1605 and 1612 and named the [...] "Place Royale"; in 1800, it was renamed the Place des Vosges. In 1607, Henry began work on a new residential triangle, the Place Dauphine, lined by thirty-two brick and stone houses, at the western end of the Île de la Cité. It was his final project for the city of Paris. Henri IV was assassinated on 14 May 1610 by François Ravaillac, a Catholic fanatic. Four years later, a bronze equestrian statue of the murdered king was erected on the Pont Neuf that faced the Place Dauphine.|$|E
2500|$|Sarnia, Ontario was Dow's first {{manufacturing}} site in Canada, {{located in the}} Chemical Valley area alongside other petrochemical companies. In 1942, the Canadian government invited Dow to build a plant there to produce styrene (an essential raw material used to make synthetic rubber for World War II). Dow then built a polystyrene plant in 1947. In August 1985, the site accidentally discharged 11,000 litres of perchloroethylene (a carcinogenic dry cleaning chemical) into the St. Clair River, which gained infamy in the media as [...] "The Blob", and Dow Canada was charged by the Ministry of the Environment. Up to the early 1990s, Dow Canada's headquarters was located at the Modeland Centre, and a new three-story complex called the River Centre was opened up on the Sarnia site in 1993 to house Research and Development. Since then, several plants (Dow terminology for a production unit) on the site have been dismantled, particularly the Basic Chemicals including Chlor Alkali unit whose closure was announced in 1991 and carried out in 1994 which affected {{nearly half of the}} site's employees. The Dow Canada headquarters were moved to Calgary, Alberta in 1996, and the Modeland Centre was sold to Lambton County and the City of Sarnia with Dow leasing some office space. [...] The Dow Fitness Centre was donated to the YMCA of Sarnia-Lambton in 2003. The Sarnia Site's workforce declined from a peak of 1600 personnel in the early 1990s to about 400 by 2002. In the late 1990s, land on the site was sold to TransAlta which built a natural gas power plant that begun operations in 2002 to supply electricity to the remaining Sarnia site plants and facilities, so that Dow could close its older less efficient steam plant (originally coal fired and later burning natural gas). On August 31, 2006, Dow announced that the entire Sarnia site would cease operations at the end of 2008. The Sarnia site had been supplied with ethylene through a pipeline from western Canada but BP officials warned Dow that shipments from the pipeline had to be suspended for safety reasons, and the loss of an affordable supply for the low density polyethylene plant rendered all the other operations at the site non-competitive. The Low-Density Polyethylene and Polystyrene units closed in 2006, followed by the Latex Unit in 2008, and finally the Propylene Oxide Derivatives Unit on April 2009. Dow afterward focused its efforts on the environmental remediation of the <b>vacant</b> <b>site,</b> which was sold to TransAlta. The former site has since been renamed the Bluewater Energy Park, with the River Centre remaining available for lease.|$|E

At each site ignition (by lightning) occurs at ignition rate λ, the parameter of the model. When a site is ignited, its occupied cluster becomes vacant instantaneously. In the literature similar models have been studied for discrete time. The most interesting behaviour occurs when the ignition rate approaches 0. It has been stated by Drossel, Clar and Schwabl (1993) that then (in our notation) the density of <b>vacant</b> <b>sites</b> (at stationarity) is of order 1 /log(1 /λ).
