5|$|The {{second book}} is largely {{devoted to the}} {{respective}} roles of faith and philosophical argument.

5|$|For decades Haitians {{have been}} {{crossing}} the Haitian-Dominican border for various reasons, including <b>voluntary</b> <b>and</b> involuntary migration, long- and short-term {{residence in the}} Dominican Republic, legal and illegal entry, smuggling, and human trafficking.

Haitians in the Dominican Republic are widely disparaged as a migrant minority because of the countries' proximity.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular and reserve armies, all former Regular Army personnel (known as the Regular Reserve) may be recalled for duty as needed. The Regular Reserve has two categories: A and D. Category A is mandatory, with {{the length of time}} in the category dependent on time spent in Regular Army service. Category D is <b>voluntary,</b> <b>and</b> consists of personnel who are no longer required to serve in category A. Regular Reserves in both categories serve under a fixed-term reserve contract and may report for training or service overseas and at home, similar to the Army Reserve. In 2007, there were 121,800 Regular Reserves, of which 33,760 served in categories A and D. Beginning in April 2013, the full Regular Reserve strength was no longer reported—only those serving in categories A and D (30,000 in 2015).|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{manpower}} of the Citizen Forces was maintained through {{a mixture of}} <b>voluntary</b> <b>and</b> compulsory service, but in 1929–30, the compulsory training scheme was abolished by the newly elected Scullin Labor government and the Citizen Forces replaced by the all-volunteer Militia. The economic hardships of the period resulted in few volunteers, and by December 1929 the 49th Battalion's strength had fallen to just 108 men of all ranks. As a result, in early 1930 the 49th Battalion merged with the Toowoomba-based 25th to form the 25th/49th Battalion. In October 1934, amidst a wide-scale reorganisation of the Militia, the two battalions were delinked and the 49th was amalgamated with the 9th Battalion. They remained linked until July 1940, when the 49th Battalion was reformed {{in its own right}} as Australia mobilised for the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|St Petersburg {{academic}} psychiatrist professor Yuri Nuller {{notes that}} the concept of Snezhnevsky's school allowed psychiatrists to consider, for example, schizoid psychopathy and even schizoid character traits as early, delayed in their development, stages of the inevitable progredient process, rather than as personality traits inherent to the individual, the dynamics of which might depend on various external factors. The same also applied to a number of other personality disorders. It entailed the extremely broadened diagnostics of sluggish (neurosis-like, psychopathy-like) schizophrenia. Despite a number of its controversial premises and in line with the traditions of then Soviet science, Snezhnevsky's hypothesis has immediately acquired the status of dogma which was later overcome in other disciplines but firmly stuck in psychiatry. Snezhnevsky's concept, with its dogmatism, proved to be psychologically comfortable for many psychiatrists, relieving them from doubt when making a diagnosis. That carried a great danger: any deviation from a norm evaluated by a doctor could be regarded as an early phase of schizophrenia, with all ensuing consequences. It resulted in the broad opportunity for <b>voluntary</b> <b>and</b> involuntary abuses of psychiatry. But Snezhnevsky did not take civil and scientific courage to reconsider his concept which clearly reached a deadlock.|$|E

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) had spent $457 obtaining inspection reports earlier the year, which had been criticized by former Service NL Minister Paul Davis during the debate on Bill 29. On November 22, 2012, Hutchings and Service NL Minister Nick McGrath announced that the public could now go on the government's website and see recent health and sanitation inspection reports for restaurants. While both opposition parties agreed with the government's decision to make the reports available online, Liberal MHA Andrew Parsons said that “I have no doubt that this is a response to the Bill 29 criticism".|$|E

5|$|The school cadet corps, a {{national}} program {{now known as}} the Combined Cadet Force, was formed towards the end of 1917 and 120 cadets were recruited within a month. The governors provided £25 towards their initial expenses, and volunteers contributed haversacks, water bottles, dummy rifles and trips to summer camp. Training initially took place on the Tonbridge School rifle range. By 1952, the number of volunteer cadets had fallen to 90. During the 1970s, numbers averaged about 150 cadets. The school's Combined Cadet Force currently comprises both an Army and a Royal Air Force Section with a total establishment strength of 120 cadets, who meet on Friday afternoons following a full school day. Membership remains <b>voluntary,</b> <b>and</b> boys can join from Year Nine (aged 13–14).|$|E
5|$|While most jumping spiders {{are active}} hunters, Phaeacius is unusually sedentary, {{generally}} resting in its unusual flattened pose for hours or days on logs, tree barks, {{pieces of wood}} or any other solid surface, where it is very well camouflaged.

Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or even over its body, but if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly to bite the prey. Sometimes Phaeacius takes a more active approach, especially if without prey {{for a week or}} more. Phaeacius does not enter webs <b>voluntary,</b> <b>and</b> moves away if it touches one accidentally.

5|$|In February 2009, the Home Office {{published}} a report evaluating {{the effectiveness of}} the Gateway Protection Programme. The research it was based upon focused on refugees' integration into British society in the 18 months following their resettlement. The research found that refugees showed signs of integration, including the formation of social bonds through community groups and places of worship. The report noted that low employment rates and slow progress with acquiring English language skills were particular concerns. Younger refugees and children had made the most progress. No specific language lessons are provided under the Gateway Protection Programme. Instead, Gateway refugees who require help with their English language skills are provided with access to mainstream English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) courses, which are run by a range of state, <b>voluntary</b> <b>and</b> community-based organisations. However, the International Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC) Europe reports that in Sheffield, it can be difficult for resettled refugees to gain access to ESOL classes because demand has generally exceeded supply – a situation also noted by an evaluation of the scheme's operation in Motherwell undertaken in 2013. The Motherwell evaluation found that most of the male refugees were in employment, but that many of them were not in jobs that allowed them to use their skills. The majority of women were not in work, reflecting a lack of job opportunities but also a lack of childcare provision.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The <b>voluntary</b> {{counselling}} <b>and</b> testing lay counsellors are not {{employees of}} the City of Johannesburg at Region F, but rather receive stipend money as an incentive from the non-governmental organisations. The <b>voluntary</b> counselling <b>and</b> testing lay counsellors seem to be unhappy and dissatisfied about their functions as demonstrated by their irregular attendance at the <b>voluntary</b> counselling <b>and</b> testing sites. It became difficult for the <b>voluntary</b> counselling <b>and</b> testing clients to access the <b>voluntary</b> counselling <b>and</b> testing service {{in the absence of}} the <b>voluntary</b> counselling <b>and</b> testing lay counsellors as they had to wait in the long queues in order to be attended to by the professional nurses. In most instances, the <b>voluntary</b> counselling <b>and</b> testing clients decided rather to leave the clinics without being attended to. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the lived experiences of the <b>voluntary</b> counselling <b>and</b> testing lay counsellors and professional nurses with regard to <b>voluntary</b> counselling <b>and</b> testing services offered in the City of Johannesburg at Region F. To address the problem a contextual, qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive phenomenological, research design was used in this study. A purposive sampling method was used. Individual, in-depth, phenomenological, semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data. The interviews were directed by two open-ended research questions. A model of trustworthiness with four components namely, credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability was followed. An open coding, qualitative data analysis method was used. The ethical considerations were taken into account. The results from the analysis of the transcriptions were described. Three main themes (1) lack of appropriate counselling rooms, (2) increased workload and staff shortages (3) lack of motivation and support and their related sub-themes in table 3. 1 were identified and conceptualised within the existing literature and concluding statements were made. The supporting guidelines to improve the performance of the <b>voluntary</b> counselling <b>and</b> testing lay counsellors in conducting counselling and testing along with the limitations, recommendations, and conclusions of the study were described.
