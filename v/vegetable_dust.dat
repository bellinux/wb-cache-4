The effect of exposure to high concentrations of mixtures of hemp and flax dust was studied in 124 workers in two textile mills (mill A: 65 - 70 % hemp and the rest flax, mean dust concentration 13 · 9 mg/m 3; and mill B: about 35 % hemp and the rest flax, mean dust concentration 15 · 8 mg/m 3). A high prevalence of byssinosis was found in both mills (80 % in mill B; 46 · 8 % in mill A) after a mean exposure {{of no more than}} 13 years. In both mills, byssinotics had a higher prevalence of all chronic respiratory symptoms than non-byssinotics. This difference was more pronounced in mill A.

40|$|Byssinosis, a {{respiratory}} disease of workers on cotton, flax, and soft hemp, is classically characterized as shortness of breath, cough, and chest tightness on Mondays {{or the first}} day of return to work after a time off.

Although clinically characterized for more than a century, the underlying pathogenesis of CDIRD remains obscure. An allergic pathogenesis has been proposed. This article reviews previous and current research findings supporting this mechanism and raises the possibility that, in some individuals, CDIRD may be due to pre-existing or occupationally induced mold allergy. Current public preoccupation with occupational health hazards suggests that these are the result of a modern industrialized society. Occupational diseases were, however, first described by the Greeks and Romans. By the 4 th century B.

Aim: The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the relation between exposure to tobacco dusts and lung capacities and airflows. Materials and Methods : Two hundred thirty-one individuals who were exposed to tobacco dusts in a cigarette-manufacturing company were included in the study. One hundred individuals who were working in the same area but in other industries and were not exposed to harmful dusts were also selected as controls. Spirometry with American Thoracic Society (ATS) standards was performed for both groups. Statistical Analysis : Spirometry results were compared between the two groups using SPSS software by &#x 2032;t&#x 2032; test. Results : The mean age of the exposed and unexposed groups was 36 &# 177; 7 and 35 &# 177; 7 years, respectively.

40|$|Exposure to cotton or grain dust causes an obstructive {{bronchitis}} in certain subjects, mechanisms {{of which are}} poorly understood. A difficulty encountered in discerning mechanisms of this airway disease {{is the lack of}} knowledge of the active components of these dusts. Clinical features suggest common but not exact mechanisms of the airway disease associated with these <b>vegetable</b> <b>dusts.</b> Human and animal studies show evidence of acellular and cellular inflammatory mechanisms of the bronchoconstriction and inflammation associated with these disorders. Potential cellular sources include alveolar macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, mast cells, basophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes. Acellular origins include the complement and humoral antibody systems, both of which have been implicated, although their pathogenic role in grain or cotton dust disorders is uncertain. In this review we critically address potential inflammatory mechanisms of airway alterations resulting from cotton or grain dust exposure. General mechanisms of bronchoconstriction are first presented, then specific studies dealing with either of the two dusts are discussed. We believe this area of research may be fruitful in dissecting mechanisms of bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation, especially as more human studies are undertaken.

The levels of this contractor activity place the dusts of cotton, flax, and jute {{in the order}} of the probable incidence of byssinosis occurring in the mills spinning these fibres. Extracts of cotton dust possess a histamine-liberating activity and contain a permeability-increasing component. These actions are of plant origin and are found in the pericarp and bracts of the cotton boll. Histamine and 5 -hydroxytryptamine have also been found in some cotton dust samples. The formation of histamine by bacterial action in cotton dust does not take place under conditions found in cotton mills. The smooth muscle contractor substance is organic in nature, relatively heat-stable, and dialysable. The relevance of these results to the symptoms of byssinosis is discussed. Tests of respiratory function of card-room opera-tives in a cotton mill suggested the presence of a pharmacologically active agent in the cotton dust which was responsible for the dyspnoea of byssinosis (McKerrow, McDermott, Gilson, and Schilling, 1958), and recent experimental work has shown that the dust possesses biological activity. Antweiler (1960) and Bouhuys, Lindell, and Lundin (1960) have described the presence of a histamine-liberating substance in aqueous extracts of the dust. This activity has been attributed to the endotoxins liberated from the bacterial debris contained in the dust (Pernis, Vigliani, Cavagna, and Finulli, 1961) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: The paper {{presents}} {{the incidence of}} occupational diseases in Poland (2013). Material and Methods: Occupational disease reporting forms, supplied to the Central Register of Occupational Diseases, were used as the study material. The incidence was specified in terms of rates per 100 000 employed people. Results: The number of new cases was 2214 with the incidence rate of 15. 6. The downward trend recorded over several years continues; compared to 2012, {{the number of new}} cases decreased by 7. 8 %. Exposure to dusts (35 % cases), mostly inorganic (carbon, asbestos, and industrial dusts containing free crystalline silica) was {{the most common cause of}} occupational diseases. Among the organic dusts allergenic effects of flour and <b>vegetable</b> <b>dusts</b> predominated. Every 3 rd case of occupational disease was attributable to physical agents, mainly the way the work is done, excessive vocal effort and noise. The sections of national economy with the highest incidence comprised mining and quarrying (271. 1), manufacturing (24. 3), education (22. 4), agriculture, forestry, hunting and fishing (21. 0), human health and social assistance (20. 5). Conclusions: The decreased incidence of ‘traditional’ diseases observed over the recent 15 years and the analysis of the 2013 incidence indicate a need to revise the Polish list of occupational diseases by exposures found in the modern work environment. Particular attention should be paid to conditions prevailing in workplaces with high exposures to industrial dusts containing free crystalline silica. A considerable variation in the incidence of voice disorders in teachers between individual voivodeships (provinces) points to the need for harmonization of the standards of preventive, diagnostic and certification procedures.

Participants in the Gardenroots: A Citizen Science Garden Project completed sample collection training and submitted soil, water, <b>vegetable,</b> and <b>dust</b> samples for analysis and received their environmental monitoring results. In the Facilitating Community Action to Address Climate Change and Build Resiliency in Southern Metropolitan Tucson project, Spanish speaking community members of South Tucson underwent training in climate change and environmental quality and sample collection, and worked with families in the South Tucson community, collecting soil and water samples and providing environmental health education. For both projects, participants completed a pre- and post-survey with a variety of qualitative and quantitative questions. These survey instruments were used to evaluate differences in environmental self-efficacy and motivations. In addition, select Gardenroots participants were involved in focus groups and semi-structured interviews to understand and gauge changes in knowledge and to further explore changes in motivation and self-efficacy. The participants were primarily internally motivated and saw increases in both efficacy and knowledge as a result of participation in the program. This information is critical to moving citizen science efforts forward and determining whether such projects: 1) co-produce environmental monitoring, exposure assessment, and risk data in a form that will be directly relevant to the participant's lives, 2) increase the community’s involvement in environmental decision-making, and 3) improve environmental health education and literacy in underserved communities...|$|R
40|$|Objective The French {{national}} {{occupational disease}} surveillance and prevention network (RNV 3 P) includes the 30 occupational disease consultation centres in university hospitals to which patients are referred for potentially work-related diseases, and an occupational health service. The {{aim of this}} work is to demonstrate the contribution of RNV 3 P to national health surveillance. Methods Data from consultations are recorded in standardised occupational health reports and coded using international or national classifications. Programmed health surveillance is carried out through annual follow-up of annual referrals to experts for pre-selected disease–exposure associations, as well as incidence estimations for the well characterised working population followed by the occupational health service. Hypotheses on new emerging diseases are generated using statistical methods employed in pharmacosurveillance and by modelling as an exposome to analyse multiple exposures. Results 58 777 occupational health reports were collected and analysed from 2001 to 2007. Referrals to the 30 university hospital centres increased significantly for asbestos-related diseases, mood disorders and adjustment disorders related to psychological and organisational demands, and for elbow and shoulder disorders related to manual handling. Referrals significantly decreased for asthma and for rhinitis related to exposure to organic <b>dusts</b> (<b>vegetable</b> or animal) or chemicals, except for cosmetics and cleaning products. Estimation of incidences by the occupational health services showed different patterns in different sectors of activity. The methods for detecting emerging diseases are presented and illustrated using the example of systemic sclerosis, identifying new exposures and new sectors of activity to be investigated. Conclusion The RNV 3 P collects data from two complementary samples: 30 university hospital centres (workers or former workers) and an occupational health service (current workers).

40|$|The {{author has}} {{undertaken}} a close {{investigation of the}} distribution, development and longevity of ascaris ova in natural environment. The present study will contribute much towards working out measures {{to cope with the}} ascaris infection, clarifying the effects of the elements on the development of ascaris ova. The results revealed by the investigation are summarized as follows: 1) Examinations of the top soil of <b>vegetable</b> fields, <b>dusts</b> on the floor of parasite worms laboratories, dusts on tatami (straw mats), dusts on window sills and sandy dusts in a station waiting room disclosed, after 30 - 50 times of test in each instances, the presence of ascaris ova at the rate of 50 %, 43 %, 17 %, 46 - 0 x 1. f 7060 bfff 5 bbp+ 0 nd 4 %, respectively. The rate of presence of fertilized ova was (pretty high. Examinations of 50 flies, however, revealed no ascaris ova. 2) The ascaris ova scattered on the soil started growing during the period from March to October in the sun, and from May to October in the shade. The periods spent before starting growing were 2 - 127 days in the former and 3 - 76 days in the latter; the higher the temperature the shorter became the period. 3) In the sun ova developed into larvae during the period of 138 days between June 1 and October 17, and in the shade during the period of 106 days between June 28 and October 12. It is prerequisite that proper warmth and sufficient humidity should prevail. 4) In the sun the duration of life of ascaris ova was 16 - 209 days, or 115 days on the average, whereas in the shade it was 77 - 245 days, or 141. 5 days on the average. 5) The ova scattered in the, sun on the soil during the period from April to September developed into larvae before the year was over. (All the ova scattered in July degenerated and perished in 16 days. High temperature as well as low humidity seems to be responsible for it.) Majority of those scattered in the sun after October passed the winter before developing into larvae. Those scattered in the shade during the period from February to September all developed into larvae before the year was over, but those scattered in the shade after October all perished without developing into larvae. 6) It has been evidenced by indoor experiments that highly dry air helps expedite the death of ascaris ova. It has also been found that the ova kept in highly dry condition reach the morula stage in proper temperature but are prevented from further growth. It seems, therefore, that moisture is indispensable to the growth of ascarisova especially after the morula stage. 7) Exposition of ova to ultraviolet irradiation, when happening repeatedly and for a long duration, interrupted their development. The effect of ultraviolet rays, therefore, is not negligible on the early death of ascaris ova in summer, although it is true that high temperature as well as low humidity is mainly responsible for it. In short, it has been established {{as the result of the}} present study that, in natural environment, a temperature of over 20 ℃ and sufficient humidity are required for the growth of ascaris ova, especially after the morula stage, and, in the absence of both of them, they gradually perish; that, generally speaking, the duration of life is longer in the shade, and the rise of temperature and dry air due to radiations from the, sun shorten the duration of life; and that a large amount of ultraviolet rays helps expedite thedeath of ova. Consequently it is recognized that, from the viewpoint of public health, ascaris ova constitute serious problems during the period from June to November and that, of the ova scattered on the soil, those in the shade are epidemiologically more significant than those in the sun...|$|R

Cereal bars were making with three formulations (A, B and C), which they were different by the amount added of hydrogenated <b>vegetable</b> fat and <b>dust</b> of the pineapple bark. Subsequently, nine types of the cereal bars were prepared, three with almonds, chichÃ, three with almonds, chestnut-do-gurguÃia and three of sapucaia with almonds, which were evaluated microbiologically and sensorial. After the sensory evaluation, the cereal bars with higher notes of overall impression was chose, and those subjected to chemical analyses. The sapucaia highlighted is among the almonds evaluated, by presenting the greatest medium for most parameters evaluated. It was found by the parameter overall impression that among the formulations tested showed that the largest note of acceptance was the formulation B, between the cereal bars with the three almonds studied. The cereal bars, developed with almonds of chichÃ and sapucaia, in general, were more accepted than cereal bars with almonds of chestnut-do-gurguÃia. With regard to minerals, the highest levels in the cereal bars prepared in this study were, respectively, potassium, sodium, iron and zinc.
