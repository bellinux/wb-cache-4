50|$|While {{he was a}} {{resident}} assistant his senior year at Rutgers, Lazes learned about the concept of intentional community - that community members are responsible for improving the cohesiveness and visibility of their communities, which became {{a key element of}} the CVP. Considering the historic nature of this event and the media attention it would generate, Lazes began brainstorming ideas with Beaty on how they could apply the video production skills they learned in college to showcase the various artistic, cultural and professional communities within Charlotte before the DNC, and thus help create a more intentional community in Charlotte. Initially calling it the Charlotte <b>Video</b> <b>Encyclopedia,</b> Lazes and Beaty began working on the CVP just after they returned to Charlotte in May 2011. They also covered the convention itself, uploading videos of the transformation of Charlotte to accommodate the city-wide event.|$|E
