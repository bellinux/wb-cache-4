40|$|Problem statement: In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the probabilistic analysis of a three unit system working in a sugar Mill, wherein one unit is big {{and the other two}} units are small and identical, is examined. Upon failure of the big unit, both small units are made operative and failed unit is undertaken for repair immediately. Priority for operation is given to the big unit. Priority for repair is given to big unit if both types (i. e., big and small) of units are in queue to get the repair done. System is able to work with full capacity only if big unit or both small units are in good condition. If only one small unit is operable, the system works at reduced capacity. The system under consideration goes to rest during the non-seasonal period. Approach: System was analyzed by making use of semi-Markov processes and regenerative point technique and various measures of the system effectiveness are obtained including the profit incurred to the system. Results: Graphs had been plotted to depict the behavior of the profit with respect to failure rate for different <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> rate and with respect to revenue per unit up time for which system is working at full capacity for different <b>values</b> <b>of</b> cost for PM/CM.

DesignThirty knees from 15 rabbits were analyzed. An osteochondral defect (diameter, 4  mm; depth, 1  mm) was created on the patellar groove of the femur in both legs. The defects were filled with a chondrocyte-seeded scaffold in the right knee and an empty scaffold in the left knee. Five rabbits each were euthanized at 4, 8, and 12 weeks and their knees were examined via macroscopic inspection, histological and biochemical analysis, and quantitative MRI (T 2 mapping and dGEMRIC) to assess the state <b>of</b> tissue <b>repair</b> following allograft chondrocyte implantation with a three-dimensional scaffold for osteochondral lesions. ResultsComparatively good regenerative cartilage was observed both macroscopically and histologically. In both chondrocyte-seeded and control knees, the T 2 <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> tissues were highest at 4 weeks and showed a tendency to decrease with time.

30|$|The {{effect of}} parameters, namely {{breakdown}} rate (α) and repair rate (β), on the queue {{length of the}} system have been demonstrated in Figs.  1 and 2. It is noticed that the breakdown rate and repair rate {{are supposed to have}} contradictory effect on the queue length of the system which is very true. It is clear from Fig.  1 a–c that the queue length increases as the breakdown rate increases from 0.008 to 0.01  U for all the service time distributions. The maximum number of customers or queue length is observed in the case 1 (c) when the service time is supposed to be gamma distributed. On the other hand, in Fig.  2 wherein graphs are plotted for different <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> rate β (0.6, 0.8 and 1), LS decreases with an increase in the repair rate. This {{is due to the fact}} that an increase in breakdown rate forces the customers to accumulate in the system due to the non-working condition of the server and hence increases the queue length. However, an increase in the repair rate helps in the fast recovery of the server and thus reduces the number of customers in the system.|$|R

The most common approach of adding re- dundant information is by repetition and erasure codes. Two main processes in a distributed storage system are reconstruction of original le and regenerat- ing a new node. These two processes require bandwidth, which are termed as reconstruction-bandwidth and repair-bandwidth. The current literature treat- s these two processes separately. That is, there are methods to reduce the reconstructing bandwidth without considering the repair-bandwidth, and also there are methods to reduce the repair-bandwidth. We study these two pro- cesses together and try to jointly minimize the reconstruction-bandwidth and repair-bandwidth.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} a Continuous-Time Markov Chain model to characterise {{the propagation of}} failures in optical GMPLS rings. In order to characterize the behaviour of failure propagation epidemic-based models are commonly used. However, the existing epidemic models do {{not take into account}} the specific features of a multilayer network environment. A node failure in GMPLS-based networks can affect: Control Plane and Data plane reporting different failures scenarios. Consequently, an extended generic epidemic model called SID is proposed, in order to cover multiple failures and recovered states in a GMPLS Multilayer scenario. The CTMC model takes into account the SID model and provides a set of design rules to specify the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> rates required to achieve a given service availability, assuming a certain infection and disable rate.

40|$|In general, the {{objective}} of the current study is to measure in a temporal context the magnitude, type and location of structural change in the inner city housing stock of St. John's, Newfoundland. The principal focus is on the standing stock of residential dwellings and the process of structural change occasioned by a highly speculative and uncertain urban environment. Although the primary concern is an empirical analysis of spatial variations in structural maintenance and repair activity and stock deletions, the study also examines specifically the responsive nature of the stock to changes in home ownership and type of ownership and assesses the impact of one particular public welfare policy, housing code enforcement, upon the supply state of the active inventory. [...] The study reveals several important things. First, 26. 5 % of the inner city housing stock experienced some form of structural reinvestment between 1980 and 1982, 70. 6 % of the stock remained unchanged while 2. 9 % of the stock were physically removed. Of the dwellings that did experience reinvestment, 76. 1 % were upgraded by incumbent owners. The <b>value</b> <b>of</b> incumbent upgrading as a percent <b>of</b> the total <b>value</b> <b>of</b> all maintenance and repair activity measured 45. 2 %, nearly half of the total amount spent on structural reinvestment throughout the study area. The <b>value</b> <b>of</b> maintenance and <b>repair</b> resulting from ownership transaction was seen to vary according to the particular type of transaction involved. Transactions involving the purchase of residential properties by resident owners from non-resident corporate owners accounted for 14. 3 % <b>of</b> the total <b>value</b> <b>of</b> maintenance and <b>repair</b> generated by ownership change. Ownership transactions involving the replacement of resident owned dwellings by non-resident owners resulted in 8. 6 % <b>of</b> the total <b>value</b> <b>of</b> maintenance and <b>repair</b> activity while transactions from resident owners to different resident owners brought with them 8. 5 % <b>of</b> the total <b>value</b> <b>of</b> residential reinvestment. [...] Throughout the study area, though, 39. 4 % <b>of</b> the total <b>value</b> <b>of</b> maintenance and <b>repair</b> was involuntary and made necessary by the violation of minimum property standards. Dwellings in violation of codes and by-laws enforced by the City of St. John's amounted to 17. 5 % of all inner city dwellings and, on average, each violating dwelling incurred 5. 7 violations and took 361. 9 days to comply with letters of notification. [...] In view of the research contained herein, the current investigation contends that although there has been evidence of some reinvestment activity in the form of inner city revitalization, that which has occurred has been sporadic and spatially variable. Most importantly, recent structural change does not appear to support a process of gentrification or return to the city on a prodigious scale. Rather, incumbent upgrading of the stock has been more apparent than stock improvements made by recent in-movers. While structural disinvestment has shown signs of arrest, it has not been transformed into large scale, area-wide reinvestment activity. Being neither in decline or in revitalization, then, the inner city housing stock of St. John's as of 1982 has assumed a state of quiescence. Speculation as to its immediate future appears to be nearly as irresolute as the policy environment in which it exists...|$|R
