Martin Hannett, who produced the single, was scheduled to produce the band's debut album, Boy, but ultimately was replaced with Steve Lillywhite. From July to September 1980, U2 recorded the album at Windmill Lane Studios, drawing from their nearly 40-song repertoire at the time. Lillywhite employed unorthodox production techniques, such as recording Mullen's drums in a stairwell, and recording smashed bottles and forks played against a spinning bicycle wheel. The band found Lillywhite to be <b>very</b> <b>encouraging</b> and creative; Bono called him [...] "such {{a breath of fresh}} air", while the Edge said he [...] "had a great way of pulling the best out of everybody". The album's lead single, [...] "A Day Without Me", was released in August. Although it did not chart, the song was the impetus for the Edge's purchase of a delay effect unit, the Electro-Harmonix Memory Man, which came to define his guitar playing style and {{had a significant impact on}} the group's creative output.|$|E

[...] While Ham was especially positive about working with Harrison, and Molland described it as [...] "a great experience, he was a master in the studio … <b>very</b> <b>encouraging</b> and co-operative", Molland has also rued the band's loss of creative control, such that the result was far from their original vision.|$|E

Techniques from the Artificial Neural Networks and from fuzzy logic have been combined to generate a neuro-fuzzy model to forecast the tourism demand on next year in island of Crete. The tourist practitioners are very interesting in tourism forecasts in order to plan more effectively tourism strategies. To modeling the complexity and the uncertainty of tourism environment is important to apply fuzzy techniques. The input of the model is a time series of the previous annual overnight stays. Classical statistics measures are calculated in order to asses the model performance. Further the results are compared with an ARMA and an AR model. The results are <b>very</b> <b>encouraged...</b>|$|R

[...] Before Ignácz's death, he reported several extraordinary things about his son: that Ervin had tried to sing before he was one year old; that he reproduced tunes correctly before he was two; he began to compose at the age of two; and that he played almost every song he heard correctly on a mouth-organ {{by the time he reached}} age three; by the age of seven Ervin could identify any note or chord that was played for him. He was known for his musicality just as much as his technique. On tests of general intelligence, Ervin scored a few years above average, meaning he was prodigy, not a savant. [...] Ervin's mother, Mária, was a stage mother who tried (unsuccessfully) to dissuade him from studying opera and symphonic music and pushed her son to study the standard piano repertoire so he could concertize and make money for their family. [...] (In later years, the pianist would claim that his mother sexually molested him.)
