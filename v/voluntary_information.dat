The study modeled economic factor with three variables and financial market factor with three variables against <b>voluntary</b> carbon <b>information</b> disclosure in the real estate industry.

The model achieved a good fit, and was acceptable prediction. The results show that financial market factor has a significant predictive influence on voluntary carbon disclosure. The application of the result is that financial market factor is has a significantly positive influence on companies' willingness to make voluntary carbon disclosure in the real estate industry.

Purpose: We investigate some company-specific factors to decide whether these determine the extent of <b>voluntary</b> <b>information,</b> particularly inquired by small shareholders and investors, in the annual reports of listed Swedish companies.

Procedure: With statistical methods we have tested hypotheses on relations between company-specific factors and the extent of <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> in the annual reports. Results: It is significant that profitability, industry type and quotation status have relations with the extent of <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> inquired by small shareholders and investors.

40|$|In 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission {{enacted the}} Securities Offering Reform (Reform), which relaxes “gun-jumping” restrictions, thereby {{allowing}} firms to more freely disclose information before equity offerings.

Our findings not only inform the debate on the market effect of the Reform, but also speak to the literature on the relation between <b>voluntary</b> disclosure and <b>information</b> asymmetry by examining the effect of quasi-exogenous changes in <b>voluntary</b> disclosure on <b>information</b> asymmetry, and thus a firm's cost of capital...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} {{the impact of}} governance rules on share price and liquidity, using the turnover ratio and the bid-ask spread as proxies for the information asymmetry. We used a SEM model and analyzed the indirect relations through the <b>voluntary</b> disclosure of <b>information</b> and the organizational performance. We built a voluntary disclosure index {{based on the information}} firms provided in their annual reports and divided the governance characteristics in two constructs: directors’ and supervisors’ structures and ownership structure. We concluded that the ownership structure exerts a direct influence on share price and share liquidity, Otherwise, the directors’ and supervisors’ structures exert an indirect influence, through the organizational performance and the <b>voluntary</b> disclosure of <b>information.</b> The results also show that for firms with high levels of disclosure the bid-ask spread is lower. However, in firms with a high ownership concentration investors tend to increase the bid-ask spreads and trade less, which, in this case, reduces the liquidity of the stock. The failure to find the relationship between <b>voluntary</b> disclosure of <b>information</b> and the turnover ratio shows us that the liquidity of shares is more related to the greater or lesser concentration of shareholders, with the performance of their companies than with the access to information. Moreover, {{it is clear that the}} role that information disclosure plays is mainly at the level of price formation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} if {{the level}} of voluntary disclosure affects the association between current returns and future earnings. Economic theory suggests that firms might find it advantageous to provide additional pieces of information (i. e., voluntary disclosure) to investors and analysts (Verrecchia 1983). Our results indicate that more voluntary disclosure does not improve the association between current returns and future earnings; i. e. current returns do not reflect more future earnings news. This finding raises the question whether <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> in the annual report contains value relevant information about future earnings or if investors are simply not capable of incorporating <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> in the firm value estimates.

40|$|This study {{examines}} if three hypothesized variables affect {{the extent of}} corporate strategic information, i. e. <b>voluntary</b> <b>information,</b> in corporate annual reports, specifically in Sweden {{in the year of}} 2012. The variables deemed appropriate to the Swedish environment, i. e. firm size, ownership dispersion and performance, were retrieved from previous disclosure research conducted in a Swedish context (Cook, 1989; Adrem, 1999), as well as relevant theoretical consideration. The statistical analysis conducted in this thesis suggests that firm size is significantly positively related to the extent of strategic corporate information in Swedish listed firms’ corporate annual reports. The result hence confirms the expectation that larger listed firms to a larger extent disclose strategic corporate information, i. e. <b>voluntary</b> <b>information,</b> in their corporate annual reports. No positive relation was found between the variables performance or ownership dispersion and the extent of strategic corporate information. The results of this thesis are interpreted to suggest that asymmetric information and agency costs are important determinants of the extent of strategic corporate information, i. e. <b>voluntary</b> <b>information,</b> in Swedish corporate annual reports. Larger firms seem to reduce agency costs and narrow the information asymmetry by increasing the level of information disclosed. ...|$|E
