40|$|There {{are several}} methods of {{providing}} series compensation for transmission lines using power electronic switches. Four methods of series compensation {{have been examined}} in this thesis, the thyristor controlled series capacitor, a <b>voltage</b> <b>sourced</b> <b>inverter</b> series compensator using a capacitor as the series element, a current <b>sourced</b> <b>inverter</b> series compensator and a <b>voltage</b> <b>sourced</b> <b>inverter</b> using an inductor as the series element. All the compensators examined will provide a continuously variable series voltage which {{is controlled by the}} switching of the electronic switches. Two of the circuits will offer both capacitive and inductive compensation, the thyristor controlled series capacitor and the current <b>sourced</b> <b>inverter</b> series compensator. The other two will produce either capacitive or inductive series compensation. The thyristor controlled series capacitor offers the widest range of series compensation. However, there is a band of unavailable compensation between 0 and 1 pu capacitive compensation. Compared to the other compensators examined the harmonic content of the compensating voltage is quite high. An algebraic analysis showed that {{there is more than one}} state the thyristor controlled series capacitor can operate in. This state has the undesirable effect of introducing large losses. The <b>voltage</b> <b>sourced</b> <b>inverter</b> series compensator using a capacitor as the series element will provide only capacitive compensation.
