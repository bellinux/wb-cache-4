25|$|The term instant runoff {{voting is}} derived from the name of a class of voting methods called runoff voting. In runoff voting <b>voters</b> <b>do</b> not rank {{candidates}} in order of preference on a single ballot. Instead a similar effect is achieved by using multiple rounds of voting. All multi-round runoff voting methods allow voters to change their preferences in each round, incorporating the results of the prior round to influence their decision. This is not possible in IRV, as participants vote only once, and this prohibits certain forms of tactical voting that can be prevalent in 'standard' runoff voting.|$|E
25|$|The Reform Party's {{success in}} 1993 {{was related to}} the {{mobilization}} of people who were opposed to the welfare state, but this represents only one dimension of the party's appeal. Jenkins (2002) examines the effect of issues on Reform support during the campaign and considers the actual process by which issues affected party support. Although candidates can prime or stress certain issues for voters, the priming label is sometimes misused. Jenkins makes a distinction between campaign learning and priming. If <b>voters</b> <b>do</b> not know where a party stands on an issue, they cannot adequately employ this information in their overall evaluation. Evidence demonstrates that the increased importance of attitudes toward the welfare state was largely a function of the distribution of new information or learning, while the increased importance of cultural questions represented priming.|$|E

25|$|The President is {{directly}} {{elected by the}} people for a term of five years and a maximum of two consecutive terms. The president is not, strictly speaking, the sole chief {{of the executive branch}} or the chief administrator. The Lithuanians borrowed the French model of the presidency, then adapted it to their needs. Candidates must be at least forty years old. To be elected in the first round, 50 per cent of the voters must participate and a candidate must receive {{more than half of the}} total votes cast. If 50 per cent of the <b>voters</b> <b>do</b> not participate, a plurality wins the presidency unless it constitutes less than one-third of the total vote. If the first round does not produce a president, a second round is held within two weeks between the two top candidates. A plurality vote is sufficient to win.|$|E
25|$|McKinney {{protested the}} result in court, {{claiming}} {{that thousands of}} Republicans had voted in the Democratic primary against McKinney in revenge for her anti-Bush administration views and her allegations of voter fraud in Florida in the 2000 presidential election. Like 20 other states, Georgia operates an open primary: <b>voters</b> <b>do</b> not align with a political party when they register to vote and may participate in whichever party's primary election they choose. Thus, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in California Democratic Party v. Jones, which had held that California's blanket primary violated the First Amendment (despite {{the fact that the}} Court explicitly differentiated— albeit in dicta— the blanket primary from the open primary in Jones), on McKinney's behalf, five voters claimed that the open primary system was unconstitutional, operating in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the associational right protected by the First Amendment, and various statutory rights protected by § 2 of the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
25|$|As all {{the polls}} around the country closed at 7p.m., the first exit polls were {{published}} by the major television networks. They showed Ivo Josipović easily claiming first place, but failing to obtain an outright majority winning 32%. The polls showed Milan Bandić, Andrija Hebrang and Nadan Vidošević in a statistical tie with each of them achieving 14%, 12% and 11% respectively. Andrija Hebrang's third place {{was seen as a}} great success as most opinion polls before the first round showed him with only single-digit approval, while Nadan Vidošević's placing was seen as a disappointment since most polls before the vote showed him battling for second place with Milan Bandić. The polls predicted Vesna Pusić and Dragan Primorac would be the only other candidates to pass 5% with each of them collecting 7% and 5% respectively. In 2007, during the parliamentary election, all exit polls predicted SDP would narrowly win, when in the reality HDZ turned out as the victor. With that in mind, Andrija Hebrang expressed conviction that when actual results were published, he would overtake Bandić and qualify for second round. He claimed that exit polls do {{not take into account the}} votes coming from the citizens living abroad and that conservative <b>voters</b> <b>do</b> not participate in exit polls as much as liberal voters. However, the exit polls predicted the outcome almost perfectly as the country's electoral commission's results later confirmed.|$|E

25|$|Water boards (waterschap and hoogheemraadschap, pl. waterschappen and hoogheemraadschappen) {{are among}} the oldest {{government}} authorities in the Netherlands. They literally form {{the foundation of the}} whole Dutch system of local government; from time immemorial they have shouldered the responsibility for water management for the residents of their area. In polders this mainly involves regulating the water level. It has always been in the common interest to keep water out and polder residents have always had to work together. That is what {{led to the creation of}} water boards. The structure of the water boards varies, but they all have a general administrative body and an executive board (college van dijkgraaf en heemraden) consisting of a chairperson (dijkgraaf) and other members ((hoog)heemraad, pl. (hoog)heemraden). The chairperson also presides the general administrative body. This body consists of people representing the various categories of stakeholders: landholders, leaseholders, owners of buildings, companies and, since recently, all the residents as well. Importance and financial contribution decide how many representatives each category may delegate. Certain stakeholders (e.g. environmental organisations) may be given the power to appoint members. The general administrative body elects the executive board from among its members. The government appoints the chairperson for a period of six years. The general administrative body is elected for a period of four years. In the past the administrative body was elected as individuals but from 2009 they will be elected as party representatives. Unlike municipal council elections, <b>voters</b> <b>do</b> not usually have to go to a polling station but can vote by mail.|$|E

Restricting voters to a maximum number of preferences {{is more likely to}} exhaust ballots if <b>voters</b> <b>do</b> not anticipate which candidates will finish in the top two. This can encourage voters to vote more tactically, by ranking at least one candidate they think is likely to win.|$|E

2500|$|The Cuban {{government}} {{describe the}} full Cuban electoral {{process as a}} form of democracy.

2500|$|Tatangelo, at seventy-seven, made a {{stronger}} showing as a write-in candidate {{than had been}} the norm in Laredo, but Martinez prevailed with nearly 75 percent of the vote. Martinez hence won {{the first of his}} three terms as county judge. (Martinez has since returned as a trustee for Laredo Community College.) In that campaign, Tatangelo said that he had been a Democrat since 1936, when he was still living in Rhode Island. In Texas, one is officially a [...] "Democrat" [...] or a [...] "Republican," [...] for that matter, only if he votes in his party's primary election or runoff election in the spring of even years. His party designation is good for two years — until the next primary elections. He can adopt a party label as a personal preference, but he is officially a Democrat or a Republican in Texas only by voting in his party's primary or runoff election. In that the majority of Texas <b>voters</b> <b>do</b> not usually participate in any party primary, most of the state's electorate consists of unaffiliated voters.|$|E
2500|$|In Victoria, Family First, the Christian Democrats and the DLP {{allocated}} their senate preferences to Labor, to {{help ensure}} the re-election of the number three Labor Senate candidate, Jacinta Collins, a Catholic who has conservative views on some social issues such as abortion. In exchange, Labor gave its Senate preferences in Victoria to Family First ahead of the Greens, expecting Family First to be eliminated before these preferences were distributed. In the event, however, Labor and Democrat preferences helped Family First's Steve Fielding beat the Green's David Risstrom to win the last Victorian Senate seat and become Family First's first Federal parliamentarian. This outcome generated some controversy and highlighted a lack of transparency in preference deals. Family First were elected in Victoria after receiving 1.88% of the vote, even though the Greens had the largest minor party share of the vote with 8.8%. In Australia, 95% of voters vote [...] "above the line" [...] in the Senate. Many [...] "above the line" [...] <b>voters</b> <b>do</b> not access preference allocation listings, although they are available in polling booths and on the AEC website, so they are therefore unaware of where their vote may go. The end result was one Family First, three Liberal and two Labor Senators elected in Victoria.|$|E

2500|$|Haaretz writer Nadav Shragai {{wrote that}} Sternhell angered right-wing extremists in Israel because, in their view, some of Sternhell's {{statements}} [...] "justified {{the murder of}} settlers by terrorists and tried to foment civil war." [...] For instance, in a 2001 Hebrew op-ed piece in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Sternhell wrote: [...] "Many in Israel, perhaps even {{the majority of the}} <b>voters,</b> <b>do</b> not doubt the legitimacy of the armed resistance in the territories themselves. The Palestinians would be wise to concentrate their struggle against the settlements, avoid harming women and children and strictly refrain from firing on Gilo, Nahal Oz or Sderot; it would also be smart to stop planting bombs {{to the west of the}} Green Line. By adopting such an approach, the Palestinians would be sketching the profile of a solution that is the only inevitable one: The amended Green Line will be an international border and territory will be handed over to compensate the Palestinians for land that has already been or will be annexed to Israel." [...] He similarly wrote in Davar in 1988 that [...] "Only those who are prepared to take Ofra with tanks can stop the fascist erosion threatening to drown Israel's democracy." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} {{tactical}} considerations for {{political parties in}} the number of candidates they stand in an election where full ballots are not required. Standing too few candidates may result in all of them being elected in the early stages, and votes being transferred to candidates of other parties. Standing too many candidates might result in first-preference votes being spread too thinly amongst them, and consequently several potential winners with broad second-preference appeal may be eliminated before others are elected and their second-preference votes distributed. This effect is amplified when <b>voters</b> <b>do</b> not stick tightly to their preferred party's candidates; however, if voters vote for all candidates from a particular party before any other candidates and before stopping expressing preferences, then too many candidates is not an issue. In Malta, where voters tend to stick tightly to party preferences, parties frequently stand more candidates than there are seats to be elected. Similarly, in Australian Senate elections, voters also tend to vote along party lines due to the relative ease of endorsing a party's declared preference order, even though the parties do not encourage voters to peruse that order, but urge them to take it on trust, as evidenced by their [...] distributed outside polling booths, rather than individually casting their own complete preference order. In the Republic of Ireland, the main political parties usually give careful consideration as to how many candidates to put forward in various Dáil (parliamentary) constituencies. Transfers are often not along party lines, but rather go towards more prominent local personalities. Election posters for the most prominent candidate of a political party usually list preferred 2nd (and possibly 3rd) preferences for that party.|$|E
50|$|Assume the 4 <b>voters</b> <b>do</b> {{not show}} up at the polling place.|$|E
50|$|This {{means that}} if a <b>voter</b> <b>does</b> not use any of his of her {{preferences}} to support {{one of the candidates}} who survives to the second round, then it will be impossible to transfer that vote, which is therefore 'wasted' or 'exhausted'.|$|R
5000|$|Note (1857): As {{the number}} of electors who voted is unascertained, the minimum turnout is {{calculated}} by dividing {{the number of}} votes by two. To the extent that <b>voters</b> <b>did</b> not use both their votes the turnout figure will be an underestimate.|$|R
