40|$|Non-genomic {{effects of}} steroid hormones on cell {{physiology}} {{have been reported}} in the brain. However, relatively little is known about the behavioral significance of these actions. Male sexual behavior is activated by testosterone partly through its conversion to estradiol via the enzyme aromatase in the preoptic area (POA). Brain aromatase activity (AA) changes rapidly which might in turn be important for the rapid regulation of behavior. Here, acute effects of <b>Vorozole</b> (TM), an aromatase inhibitor, injected IP at different doses and times before testing (between 15 and 60 min), were assessed on male sexual behavior in quail. To limit the risk of committing both types of statistical errors (I and II), data of all experiments were entered into a meta-analysis. <b>Vorozole</b> (TM) significantly inhibited mount attempts (P < 0. 05, size effect [g] = 0. 527) and increased the latency to first copulation (P < 0. 05, g = 0. 251).

Behavioral inhibitions always reached a maximum at 30 min. Another aromatase inhibitor, androstatrienedione, induced a similar rapid inhibition of sphincter movements. Radioenzyme assays demonstrated that within 30 min <b>Vorozole</b> (TM) had reached the POA and completely blocked AA measured in homogenates.

40|$|Three new {{aromatase}} inhibitors {{have recently}} completed phase III evaluation as treatment of metastatic {{breast cancer in}} post-menopausal women whose disease has progressed despite tamoxifen therapy: anastrozole (ARIMIDEX, Zeneca), letrozole (FEMARA, Novartis) and <b>vorozole</b> (RIVIZOR, Janssen). All belong to the third generation of non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors, and each is superior to previous generations in terms of potency and selectivity. The trials that have been performed compare each agent to megestrol acetate, and letrozole and <b>vorozole</b> to aminoglutethimide. Although the studies are not directly comparable due to differing study designs and patient populations, it has been demonstrated each of these drugs provides single agent, once-daily, oral palliation of hormone-responsive, post-menopausal metastatic breast cancer. Letrozole is clearly more effective than megestrol acetate, and anastrozole and <b>vorozole</b> are possibly so. All three are better tolerated than the progestin, particularly in terms of weight gain. Both letrozole and <b>vorozole</b> are significantly more effective, and better tolerated than aminoglutethimide. Overall, this most recent generation of aromatase inhibitors is a clear improvement on our current standard second-line therapies. In 1999, tamoxifen remains the first choice in the hormonal therapy of breast cancer. Following tamoxifen failure, the optimal second-line hormonal therapy remains undefined, but aminoglutethimide and megestrol acetate are no longer optimal therapy in this setting. The third-generation non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors must now be compared to each other, to the steroidal aromatase inhibitors, to the pure anti-oestrogens, and to tamoxifen.

40|$|Background. Aminoglutethimide was {{the first}} {{aromatase}} inhibitor to be used successfully in breast cancer patients. However, this drug also inhibits mineral corticoid and glucocortioid synthesis, making co-medication with corticosteroids necessary, and it is often poorly tolerated. The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerability of <b>vorozole,</b> a new non-steroidal oral aromatase inhibitor, in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. The secondary objective was to evaluate the pharmacodynamic activity of the drug. Subjects and method's. Thirty-four postmenopausal patients previously treated with tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting and/or for advanced disease were treated with <b>vorozole,</b> 2. 5 mg once daily. Patients were monitored with respect to treatment efficacy and safety. Hormonal evaluations were performed at baseline and {{during the course of}} treatment in order to evaluate the pharmacodynamic efficacy and safety of <b>vorozole.</b> Results: According to UICC criteria, there were seven responders, one complete and six partial, for an overall response rate of 21 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 9 %- 38 %). The median duration of response was 9. 6 months (95 % CI 4. 6 - 0), the median time to progression for the entire group was 4. 7 months (95 % CI 2. 9 - 6. 6) and the median survival time was 29. 7 months (95 % CI 19. 1 - 0). Tolerability was excellent to good in 97 % of the patients. Oestradiol and oestrone levels were suppressed to the limit of detection of the assays used.

40|$|Aromatization of androgens into estrogens may be {{important}} for maintenance of the male skeleton. To address this hypothesis, we evaluated the skeletal effects of selective estrogen deficiency as induced by the aromatase inhibitor <b>vorozole</b> (Vor), with or without 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)) administration (1. 35 microg/day), in aged (12 -month-old) male rats. A baseline group was killed {{at the start of}} the experiment (Base). The control group (Control), the group treated with <b>vorozole</b> alone (Vor), the group treated with E(2) alone (E(2)), or the group with a combination of both (Vor + E(2)) were killed 15 weeks later. <b>Vorozole</b> significantly increased serum testosterone (T) and reduced serum E(2) compared with Control. Body weight gain and serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) were also lower in Vor, whereas significant weight loss and decrease of serum IGF-I occurred as a result of E(2) administration. Bone formation as assessed by serum osteocalcin was unaffected but osteoid surface in the proximal metaphysis of the tibia was increased in Vor-treated rats. Bone resorption as evaluated by urinary deoxypyridinoline excretion was increased in Vor. Biochemical parameters of bone turnover were reduced significantly in all E(2) treated rats. Premature closure of the growth plates and decreased osteoid and mineralizing surfaces were also observed in E(2) and Vor + E(2). Apparent bone density of lumbar vertebrae and femur, as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), was significantly reduced in Vor. <b>Vorozole</b> decreased femoral bone density mainly in the distal femur (trabecular and cortical region). This decrease of bone density was not present in E(2) and Vor + E(2). Similar findings were observed when bone density was assessed by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT); that is, trabecular density of the distal femur, the proximal tibia, and the distal lumbar vertebra were all lower in Vor. This decrease in density was not observed in all E(2) -treated animals. In conclusion, administration of the aromatase inhibitor, <b>vorozole,</b> to aged male rats induces net trabecular bone loss in both the appendicular and axial skeleton, despite a concomitant increase in serum testosterone. E(2) administration is able to prevent this trabecular bone loss in vorozole-treated animals. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The new non-steroidal {{aromatase}} inhibitor <b>vorozole</b> (R 83842) {{was administered}} orally {{at a single}} daily dose of 2. 5 mg to 27 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer in a phase II trial as second-line endocrine treatment. The observed objective response rate of 30 % and good tolerability of the drug confirm other recent reports. Endocrine determinations during 6 months of treatment demonstrated reduction of serum estrogens: estrone sulfate by more than 60 %, estrone by 30 - 40 %, but estradiol by only 10 - 20 %. The ratios of serum androstenedione/estrone and testosterone/estradiol increased significantly, consistent with the inhibition of peripheral aromatase activity. Levels of progesterone, 17 -alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione and aldosterone remained normal, indicating no interference with adrenocortical steroid synthesis. A general lack of correlation between the observed serum concentrations of <b>vorozole</b> {{and its effect on}} hormone serum levels or clinical response was found. This suggests that the determination of such serum levels gives a poor impression of the unambiguous anti-tumor activity of <b>vorozole</b> which may well have its main effect with the tumor tissue itself.

All had been previously treated with tamoxifen as adjuvant (two patients) or for advanced disease (24 patients), or both (one patient). Objective remissions were observed in eight patients (30 %) with two complete responses (CR) and six partial responses (PR) lasting for a median of 14. 3 months (range 6. 8 - 40. 6); nine stabilizations were also recorded (median 7. 9 months; range 3. 7 - 40. 1). Median time to progression for the 27 patients was 5. 9 months. Sites of response were skin (three patients), lymph nodes (two patients), lung (two patients) and chest wall plus lymph nodes (one patient).

At the age of 4 wk, control and vorozole-treated birds were cannulated, and serial blood samples were withdrawn every 10 min for 5 hr, wherein GH pulsatility characteristics were determined using deconvolution analysis. The proportional abdominal fat pad weight was reduced significantly in the treated groups, especially in female birds. The <b>vorozole</b> treatment increased plasma T- 3, E- 2, T, and GH concentrations, and decreased T- 4. The frequency of the GH pulses was lower and the interval between the bursts (min) was higher in the vorozole-treated group, as were the mass secreted per burst (ng/ml), the amplitude (ng/ml/min) and the production rate (ng/ml/ 5 hr). In conclusion, early in ovo treatment with a potent aromatase inhibitor is able to increase the mean serum T- 3 and GH concentration and masculinize the GH pulse pattern, resulting in an economically favorable decrease in abdominal fat pad content in male and female broilers at slaughter age.

In the first experiment we measured AA in brain regions micropunched in adult male and female Japanese quail utilizing the novel strategy of basing the microdissections {{on the distribution of}} aromatase-immunoreactive cells. The largest sex difference was found in the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (mBST) followed by the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) and the tuberal hypothalamic region.

Two synthetic 18 F-labelling approaches to the etomidate and <b>vorozole</b> analogues were developed, and the analogues were evaluated in some biological assays. The two-step labelling method was used to synthesise many compounds for biological evaluation. In the first step, a 18 F-labelled intermediate based on a ditosylate or a halogenated diethyl ether was synthesised and used directly in the next alkylation step. The decay-corrected (d. c.) radiochemical yield was higher compared to other known two-step labelling methods. Once an appropriate candidate has been chosen for clinical evaluation, a one-step labelling method will be more suitable. We therefore developed a method based on precursors that had leaving groups {{at the end of}} their alkyl chains, and used these directly in the 18 F-labelling synthesis. The one-step 18 F-labelling synthesis required less reaction time and produced higher specific radioactivity and d. c. radiochemical yield than our two-step synthesis.

40|$|Requests for offprints {{should be}} {{addressed}} to R C Coombes) Over the past decade several novel aromatase inhibitors have been introduced into clinical practice. The discovery of these drugs followed on from the observation that the main mechanism of action of aminogluthemide was via inhibition of the enzyme aromatase thereby reducing peripheral levels of oestradiol in postmenopausal patients. The second-generation drug, 4 -hydroxyandrostenedione (formestane), was introduced in 1990 and although its use was limited by its need to be given parenterally it was found to be a well-tolerated form of endocrine therapy.

40|$|Aromatase is {{an enzyme}} that {{facilitates}} {{the conversion of}} androgens to estrogens and {{may play a role}} in mood and mental status. The main theme of this thesis is the imaging of brain aromatase by use of the PET technique. The PET tracer for aromatase, 11 C-labeled <b>vorozole</b> (VOZ) was developed and evaluated by with in vitro and in vivo methods. In vitro experiments using rat brain showed that VOZ was distributed in the medial amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and medial preoptic area, regions of the brain known to be rich in aromatase and the KD value was determined to be 0. 60 nM. The in vivo PET study in rhesus monkey brain revealed that VOZ penetrated the blood-brain barrier and accumulated in the amygdala and hypothalamus. Taken together, VOZ is a good PET tracer for in vivo aromatase imaging with high affinity and high sensitivity. This technique was applied to an investigation of brain aromatase under the physiological conditions simulating anabolic-androgenic steroid abuse. A significant increase in VOZ binding by anabolic-androgenic steroids was observed in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis and medial preoptic area in the rat brain. In contrast, no significant change in binding was observed in the medial amygdala. These results indicate that the manner of regulation of aromatase expression might be different in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis and medial preoptic area compared with that in the medial amygdala. The aromatase expression was suggested to be regulated through androgen receptors, as indicated in a study with flutamide treatment. The increased aromatase expression was seen in neurons. The PET study with anabolic steroid-treated rhesus monkeys also showed increased VOZ binding in the hypothalamus but not in the amygdala. The alteration of density of aromatase binding in the hypothalamic area could explain some psychological features of anabolic-androgenic steroid abusers. Novel PET tracers for aromatase were developed and examined. The two newly synthesized 18 F-labeled <b>vorozole</b> analogs, [18 F]FVOZ and [18 F]FVOO, displayed different characteristics. Both tracers showed similar binding pattern as VOZ; however, [18 F]FVOO was metabolized very quickly, meaning that this tracer is not suitable as a PET tracer. On the other hand, [18 F]FVOZ can be an appropriate PET tracer. The role of aromatase in the human brain has not been clarified yet.

We found that Bcl- 2 and Bax were equally expressed in epithelial cells of terminal end buds, ducts, and alveoli. However, in myoepithelial cells, the level of Bax expression was much higher than the level of Bcl- 2 expression. Bcl- 2 and Bax levels in hyperplastic lesions were similar to those of normal mammary epithelial cells but lower in most carcinomas in situ and carcinomas. In animals with established mammary tumors, Vz induced apoptotic cell death, which was primarily associated with a decrease in Bcl- 2 and, to a lesser extent, with a decrease in Bax.

40|$|The {{effects of}} two steroidal (4 -hydroxyandrostenedione and atamestane) and three non-steroidal (fadrozole, <b>vorozole</b> and pentrozole) {{aromatase}} inhibitors on {{the levels of}} aromatase mRNA and protein were examined using cultured JEG- 3 and HepG 2 cells. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrated increased quantities of immunoreactive aromatase in both cell types {{as a result of}} these treatments. To clarify this effect in detail, quantitation of aromatase protein in JEG- 3 cells was performed after various treatments using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Time-dependent increase was observed with all the aromatase inhibitors except 4 -hydroxyandrostenedione. The three non-steroidal agents caused an approximately fourfold elevation in the cells 24 h after the treatment compared with untreated controls. The inhibitors also appeared to block the rapid degradation observed in JEG- 3 cells after induction with forskolin. However, aromatase mRNA levels in JEG- 3 cells remained unchanged. Furthermore, the increase in aromatase protein in JEG- 3 cells due to the inhibitor action was not blocked by treatment with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis.

40|$|Brain {{aromatase}} (ARO) {{activity in}} the quail is markedly enhanced by testosterone (T). This effect only becomes detectable after several hours and reaches its maximum within a few days, which suggests enzymatic induction at the genomic level. This idea {{is reinforced by the}} fact that T also increases the ARO protein, as observed by immunocytochemistry (ICC) and the ARO mRNA, as measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These changes can be mimicked by the administration of estrogens and therefore presumably require T aromatization. In our first test, injection of the non-steroidal ARO inhibitor, R 76713 (racemic <b>vorozole),</b> unexpectedly revealed an increase in ARO immunore{{activity in the}} preoptic area (POA) of treated birds. This property of R 76713 was shared by another non-steroidal inhibitor, fadrozole, but not by two steroidal inhibitors, androstatrienedione (ATD) and 4 -hydroxy-androstenedione (OHA). These last two compounds markedly decreased the concentration of brain ARO as estimated by ICC. In parallel, ATD and OHA decreased ARO mRNA concentration measured by RT-PCR but <b>vorozole</b> and fadrozole had no effect on these concentrations in the POA, and only caused them to decrease slightly in the posterior hypothalamus. Together, these data indicate that the removal of estrogens caused by steroidal inhibitors decreases the synthesis of ARO, presumably at the transcriptional level. Additional regulatory mechanisms apparently take place after the injection of non-steroidal inhibitors and probably include increased half-life of the protein. The induction of ARO activity by steroids appears to be greater in males than in females, but this difference has been difficult to localize and confirm by assay methods. We therefore analysed by ICC the tridimensional distribution of ARO-ir neurons in the POA of males and females that were sexually mature or gonadectomized and treated with T-filled or control empty implants. Localized sex differences and effects of T were detected in this way. In particular, males had more ARO-ir cells than females in the lateral POA but a difference in the opposite direction was evident in the medial part of this area. These sex differences are largely activational (i. e. caused by the higher T levels in males) but they may also reflect organizational effects of neonatal steroids. Castration decreased ARO-ir cell numbers in the lateral POA, but increased it in the periventricular region. This anatomically specialized control by T may be mediated by three potential mechanisms that are discussed and comparatively evaluated: a migration of ARO neurons towards the ventricle after castration; a differential colocalization of ARO with estrogen receptors or a differential modulation of ARO neurons by catecholaminergic inputs.

The method variables were investigated in a specified range {{above and below the}} nominal method conditions. They included the concentration of an ion-pairing agent, the percentage organic modifier {{at the start of the}} linear gradient, the mobile phase flow rate, the percentage organic modifier at the end of the linear gradient and the pH of the mobile phase. Two dummy factors were included in the design to estimate the experimental error. It was found that none of the five studied variables affected significantly (t-test, alpha = 0. 01) the capacity factor, the tailing factor or the analysis time. The resolution of the critical peak pair on the other hand, was significantly influenced by the factor pH. However, the responses for the resolution of all the experimental runs in the design were well above the system suitability limit stated in the normal assay procedure. Therefore, the method can overall be considered robust. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Male Japanese quail {{produce a}} foam that, along with semen, is {{transferred}} to the quail hen during copulation. This foam {{has been reported to}} increase fertility, prolong sperm motility, and enhance sperm competition. Action of the cloacal sphincter muscles in response to visual exposure to a female produces the foam. The rhythmic cloacal sphincter movements (RCSM) responsible for foam production in male quail is elicited by a conditioned stimulus (CS) previously paired with access to a quail hen. These conditioned RCSM are testosterone-dependent. The present experiment was conducted to explore whether, {{as is the case with}} most other testosterone-dependent male sexual behaviors in the quail, conditioned RCSM are mediated by the aromatization of testosterone. Castrated, testosterone-treated male quail were presented with paired presentations of an arbitrary focal CS and visual access to a female. Once conditioned RCSM had developed, subjects received twice daily injections of the aromatase inhibitor Vorozole(TM) (R 083842) during a series of extinction test presentations of the CS. Injections of Vorozole(TM) significantly decreased the number of RCSM elicited by a sexual CS. This decrease was specific to sexual RCSM; cloacal sphincter movements that occurred following defecation were not affected by <b>Vorozole.</b> Conditioned sexual RCSM are therefore mediated by the aromatization of testosterone, most likely due to effects on central aromatase activity related to sexual motivation.

40|$|The {{transformation}} of testosterone into estradiol {{in the brain}} {{plays a key role}} in several behavioral and physiological processes, but it has been so far impossible to localize precisely the cells of the mammalian brain containing the relevant enzyme, viz., aromatase. We have recently established an immunohistochemical technique that allows the visualization of aromatase-immunoreactive cells in the quail brain. In this species, a marked increase in the optical density of aromatase-immunoreactive cells is observed in subjects that have been treated with the aromatase inhibitor, R 76713 or racemic <b>Vorozole.</b> This increased immunoreactivity, associated with a total blockade of aromatase activity, has been used as a tool in the present study in which the distribution of aromatase-immunoreactive material has been reassessed in the brain of mice pretreated with R 76713. As expected, the aromatase inhibitor increases the density of the immunoreactive signal in mice. Strongly immunoreactive cells are found in the lateral septal region, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the central amygdala, and the dorso-lateral hypothalamus. A less dense signal is also present in the medial preoptic area, the nucleus accumbens, several hypothalamic nuclei (e. g., paraventricular and ventromedial nuclei), all divisions of the amygdala, and several regions of the cortex, especially the cortex piriformis. These data demonstrate that, contrary to previous claims, aromatase-immunoreactive cells are present in all brain regions that have been shown previously to contain high aromatase activity.

40|$|The {{effects of}} two steroidal (4 -hydroxyandrostenedione and atamestane) and three non-steroidal (fadrozole, <b>vorozole,</b> and pentrozole) {{aromatase}} inhibitors on {{the levels of}} aromatase mRNA and protein were examined in vitro and in vivo. Immunocytochemistry revealed increased quantities of immunoreactive aromatase in human choriocarcinoma-derived JEG- 3 cells in response to pretreatment with the non-steroidal inhibitors. To elucidate this effect in detail, aromatase protein in JEG- 3 cells after treatment with various inhibitors was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A time-dependent increase in aromatase protein in the cells was observed with all the aromatase inhibitors except 4 -hydroxyandrostenedione, whereas aromatase mRNA levels in the cells remained unchanged during the inhibitor treatment. The three non-steroidal agents caused an approximately fourfold increase in aromatase protein in the cells 24 h after the treatment, as compared with untreated controls. The increase in aromatase protein in the cells was not blocked by treatment with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. The inhibitors also appeared to block the rapid degradation observed in JEG- 3 cells after induction by forskolin. In vivo, daily injection of the inhibitors into adult female mice caused increases in levels of both aromatase mRNA and protein in the ovary. The increase in aromatase mRNA in this in vivo study {{could be explained by}} an increase in gonadotropin concentrations in response to decreased plasma concentrations of estrogens. In conclusion, we suggest that aromatase inhibitors increase aromatase protein through stabilization and reduced protein turnover...|$|E
40|$|In Japanese quail, as in rats, the {{expression}} of male sexual behavior over relatively long time periods (days to weeks) {{is dependent on the}} local production of estradiol in the preoptic area via the aromatization of testosterone. On a short-term basis (minutes to hours), central actions of dopamine as well as locally produced estrogens modulate behavioral expression. In rats, a view of and sexual interaction with a female increase dopamine release in the preoptic area. In quail, in vitro brain aromatase activity (AA) is rapidly modulated by calcium-dependent phosphorylations that are likely to occur in vivo as a result of changes in neurotransmitter activity. Furthermore, an acute estradiol injection rapidly stimulates copulation in quail, whereas a single injection of the aromatase inhibitor <b>vorozole</b> rapidly inhibits this behavior. We hypothesized that brain aromatase and dopaminergic activities are regulated in quail in association with {{the expression}} of male sexual behavior. Visual access as well as sexual interactions with a female produced a significant decrease in brain AA, which was maximal after 5 min. This expression of sexual behavior also resulted in a significant decrease in dopaminergic as well as serotonergic activity after 1 min, which returned to basal levels after 5 min. These results demonstrate {{for the first time that}} AA is rapidly modulated in vivo in parallel with changes in dopamine activity. Sexual interactions with the female decreased aromatase and dopamine activities. These data challenge established views about the causal relationships among dopamine, estrogen action, and male sexual behavior. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{behavior}} can be usefully parsed into an appetitive and a consummatory component. Both appetitive and consummatory male-typical sexual behaviors (respectively, ASB and CSB) are activated in male Japanese quail by testosterone (T) acting in the medial preoptic nucleus (POM), but never observed in females. This sex difference {{is based on a}} demasculinization (= organizational effect) by estradiol during embryonic life for CSB, but a differential activation by T in adulthood for ASB. Males expressing rhythmic cloacal sphincter movements (RCSMs; a form of ASB) or allowed to copulate display increased Fos expression in POM. We investigated Fos brain responses in females exposed to behavioral tests after various endocrine treat- ments. T-treated females displayed RCSM, but never copulated when exposed to another female. Accordingly they showed an increased Fos expression in POM after ASB but not CSB tests. Females treated with the aromatase inhibitor <b>Vorozole</b> in ovo and T in adulthood displayed both male-typical ASB and CSB, and Fos expression in POM was increased after both types of tests. Thus, the neural circuit mediating ASB is present or can develop in both sexes, but is inactive in females unless they are exposed to exogenous T. In contrast, the neural mechanism mediating CSB is not normally present in females, but can be pre- served by blocking the embryonic production of estrogens. Overall these data confirm the difference in endocrine controls and probably neural mechanisms supporting ASB and CSB in quail, and highlight the complexity of mechanisms underlying sexual differentiation of behavior.

40|$|P 450 hemeproteins {{comprise}} a large gene superfamily that catalyzes monooxygenase reactions {{in the presence}} of a redox partner. Because the mammalian members are, without exception, membrane-bound proteins, they have resisted structure-function analysis by means of X-ray crystallographic methods. Among P 450 -catalyzed reactions, the aromatase reaction that catalyzes the conversion of C 19 steroids to estrogens is one of the most complex and least understood. Thus, to better understand the reaction mechanism, we have constructed a three-dimensional model of P 450 arom not only to examine the active site and those residues potentially involved in catalysis, but to study other important structural features such as substrate recognition and redox-partner binding, which require examination of the entire molecule (excepting the putative membrane-spanning region). This model of P 450 arom was built based on a "core structure" identified from the structures of the soluble, bacterial P 450 s (P 450 cam, P 450 terp, and P 450 BM-P) rather than by molecular replacement, after which the less conserved elements and loops were added in a rational fashion. Minimization and dynamic simulations were used to optimize the model and the reasonableness of the structure was evaluated. From this model we have postulated a membrane-associated hydrophobic region of aliphatic and aromatic residues involved in substrate recognition, a redox-partner binding region that may be unique compared to other P 450 s, as well as residues involved in active site orientation of substrates and an inhibitor of P 450 arom, namely <b>vorozole.</b> We also have proposed a scheme for the reaction mechanism in which a "threonine switch" determines whether oxygen insertion into the substrate molecule involves an oxygen radical or a peroxide intermediate...|$|E
40|$|The sigma- 2 {{receptor}} {{is expressed}} in higher density in proliferating (P) tumor cells versus quiescent (Q) tumor cells, thus providing an attractive target for imaging the proliferative status (i. e., P:Q ratio) of solid tumors.

In the first study, small animal Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging studies were conducted with [(18) F]ISO- 1 and (18) FDG in xenografts of mouse mammary tumor 66 and tracer uptake was correlated with the in vivo P:Q ratio determined by flow cytometric measures of BrdU-labeled tumor cells. The second model utilized a chemically-induced (N-methyl-N-nitrosourea [MNU]) model of rat mammary carcinoma to correlate measures of [(18) F]ISO- 1 and FDG uptake with MR-based volumetric measures of tumor growth. In addition, [(18) F]ISO- 1 and FDG were used to assess the response of MNU-induced tumors to bexarotene and <b>Vorozole</b> therapy. In the mouse mammary 66 tumors, a strong linear correlation was observed between the [(18) F]ISO- 1 tumor: background ratio and the proliferative status (P:Q ratio) of the tumor (R =  0. 87). Similarly, measures of [(18) F]ISO- 1 uptake in MNU-induced tumors significantly correlated (R =  0. 68, P< 0. 003) with changes in tumor volume between consecutive MR imaging sessions. Our data suggest that PET studies of [(18) F]ISO- 1 provide a measure of both the proliferative status and tumor growth rate, which would be valuable in designing an appropriate treatment strategy...|$|E
40|$|A nonsteroidal {{aromatase}} inhibitor <b>vorozole</b> (VOR) {{was administered}} to aged (12 months old) male Wistar rats and its effect was compared with the effect of androgen deficiency. The rats were either sham-operated (SHAM) or orchidectomized (ORCH) and treated with or without VOR. Thus, four experimental groups were created (SHAM, ORCH, SHAM + VOR, ORCH + VOR). The follow-up period was 4 months. At {{the end of the}} experimental period, bone mineral density (BMD) of the first four lumbar vertebrae and right femur was measured ex vivo with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, bone formation was evaluated by serum osteocalcin, and bone resorption by urinary excretion of (deoxy) pyridinoline. Orchidectomy increased bone resorption 2 - to 3 -fold whereas bone formation was only slightly increased. Treatment of intact male rats with VOR also increased bone resorption (+ 30 % increase) whereas bone formation was not increased in this SHAM + VOR group. Their BMD was 7 % lower in the femur (P < 0. 01) and 6 % lower in the lumbar vertebrae (P < 0. 01) compared with the SHAM group that had not received VOR. Moreover, this decrease of bone mineral density was not significantly different from the expected decrease of bone density observed in the ORCH groups (6 - 10 %). This was also reflected by a decrease of calcium content of the first four lumbar vertebrae of 15 % (P < 0. 001) in the SHAM + VOR group and 9 - 14 % (P < 0. 05) in the ORCH groups compared with the SHAM group, respectively. These data therefore suggest that inhibition of aromatization of androgens into estrogens increases bone resorption and bone loss similar to that observed after complete removal of androgens. Aromatization of androgens into estrogens may therefore, at least partly, explain the effects of androgens on skeletal maintenance. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{many species}} of vertebrates, major sex {{differences}} affect reproductive behavior and endocrinology. Most of these differences do not result from a direct genomic action but develop following early exposure to a sexually differentiated endocrine milieu. In rodents, the female reproductive phenotype mostly develops {{in the absence of}} early steroid influence and male differentiation is imposed by the early action of testosterone, acting at least in part through its central conversion into estrogens or aromatization. This pattern of differentiation {{does not seem to be}} applicable to avian species. In Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), injection of estrogens into male embryos causes a permanent loss of the capacity to display male-type copulatory behavior when exposed to testosterone in adulthood. Based on this experimental result, it was proposed that the male reproductive phenotype is "neutral" in birds (i. e. develops in the absence of endocrine influence) and that endogenous estradiol secreted by the ovary of the female embryo is responsible for the physiological demasculinization of females. This model could be recently confirmed. Females indeed display a higher level of circulating estrogens that males during the second part of their embyronic life. In addition, treatment of female embryos with the potent aromatase inhibitor, R 76713 or racemic <b>vorozole</b> which suppresses the endogenous secretion of estrogens maintains in females the capacity to display the full range of male copulatory behaviors. The brain mechanisms that control this sexually differentiated behavior have not been identified so far but recent data suggest that they should primarily concern a sub-population of aromatase-immunoreactive neurons located in the lateral parts of the sexually dimorphic preoptic nucleus. The zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) exhibits a more complex, still partly unexplained, differentiation pattern. In this species, early treatment with exogenous estrogens produces a masculinization of singing behavior in females and a demasculinization of copulatory behavior in males.

40|$|Cells immunoreactive for {{the enzyme}} {{aromatase}} were localized in the forebrain of male zebra finches {{with the use}} of an immunocytochemistry procedure. Two polyclonal antibodies, one directed against human placental aromatase and the other directed against quail recombinant aromatase, revealed a heterogeneous distribution of the enzyme in the telencephalon, diencephalon, and mesencephalon. Staining was enhanced in some birds by the administration of the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, R 76713 racemic <b>Vorozole)</b> prior to the perfusion of the birds as previously described in Japanese quail. Large numbers of cells immunoreactive for aromatase were found in nuclei in the preoptic region and in the tuberal hypothalamus. A nucleus was identified in the preoptic region based on the high density of aromatase immunoreactive cells within its boundaries that appears to be homologous to the preoptic medial nucleus (POM) described previously in Japanese quail. In several birds alternate sections were stained for immunoreactive vasotocin, a marker of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). This information facilitated the clear separation of the POM in zebra finches from nuclei that are adjacent to the POM in the preoptic area-hypothalamus, such as the PVN and the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. Positively staining cells were also detected widely throughout the telencephalon. Cells were discerned in the medial parts of the ventral hyperstriatum and neostriatum near the lateral ventricle and in dorsal and medial parts of the hippocampus. They were most abundant in the caudal neostriatum where they clustered in the dorsomedial neostriatum, and as a band of cells coursing along the dorsal edge of the lamina archistriatalis dorsalis. They were also present in high numbers in the ventrolateral aspect of the neostriatum and in the nucleus taeniae. None of the telencephalic vocal control nuclei had appreciable numbers of cells immunoreactive for aromatase within their boundaries, {{with the possible exception of}} a group of cells that may correspond to the medial part of the magnocellular nucleus of the neostriatum. The distribution of immunoreactive aromatase cells in the zebra finch brain is in excellent agreement with the distribution of cells expressing the mRNA for aromatase recently described in the finch telencephalon. This widespread telencephalic distribution of cells immunoreactive for aromatase has not been described in non-songbird species such as the Japanese quail, the ring dove, and the domestic fowl.

40|$|Aromatization of androgens into estrogens {{may explain}} some of the {{skeletal}} action of androgens. We examined the effect of the aromatase inhibitor <b>Vorozole</b> (VOR) on skeletal growth and mineral accumulation in growing 6 -week-old male Wistar rats. Rats were either Sham-operated (Sham) or Orchidectomized (Orch) and treated with or without the aromatase inhibitor VOR. One Sham-operated group was killed at Baseline (Base); the four other groups (Sham, Sham + VOR, Orch, Orch + VOR) were killed 18 weeks after surgery. As expected, all groups gained body weight, but body weight gain was significantly (- 25 %) lower in Orch, Orch + VOR, and Sham + VOR. Both bone formation, as assessed by serum osteocalcin, and bone resorption, as assessed by urinary (deoxy) pyridinoline, decreased significantly in all groups compared with Base. Orchidectomy resulted in a relative increase of biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption compared with Sham. Treatment with VOR, however, resulted only in a very moderate increase of (deoxy) pyridinoline compared with Sham. As expected, femoral length increased compared with Base, but orchidectomy reduced the relative growth of the femur whereas VOR did not influence femoral length. Ex vivo, densitometric and geometric properties of the femora were evaluated by peripheral computerized quantitative tomography (pQCT) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The lumbar vertebrae were measured by DXA. At the end of the experimental period, volumetric trabecular bone mineral density (vTBMD) measured at the distal end of the femur was significantly lower not only in both Orch groups but also in Sham + VOR. The decrease of cancellous bone density in Sham + VOR was lower than in the orchidectomized animals. A relative decrease of femoral inner and outer diameters compared with Sham and Base was observed in both Orch groups and in Sham + VOR, suggesting that both orchidectomy and VOR-treatment inhibited periosteal bone formation and endosteal bone resorption. Only orchidectomy, however, resulted in a decrease of cortical thickness. Bone area, mineral content, and density of both femora and lumbar vertebrae, measured by DXA, were decreased to a similar extent by VOR and Orch (bone mineral content of the femur was 467 +/- 18 mg in Orch and 461 +/- 10 mg in Sham +/- VOR vs. 521 +/- 11 mg in Sham; P < 0. 001). In conclusion, treatment with the aromatase inhibitor VOR impairs body weight gain and skeletal modeling and decreases bone mineral density. Aromatase inhibition had similar final effects on bone mass and size as castration, but with less marked effects on bone turnover. status: publishe...|$|E
