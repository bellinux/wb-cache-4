40|$|Abstract — Vectoring cancels {{crosstalk}} between multiple VDSL 2 lines and can greatly improve rate reach performance of VDSL 2, particularly on short loops. Vectoring is only performed on <b>lines</b> within a <b>vector</b> group so that <b>vectored</b> <b>lines</b> may experience un-cancelled crosstalk from nearby lines {{that are either}} non-vectored or in a separate vector group (mixed scenario). If nothing is done to mitigate the effects of un-cancelled crosstalk in mixed scenarios, then <b>vectored</b> <b>lines</b> may suffer performance degradation which in some cases may be substantial. This argument {{has been used to}} advocate for market competition restrictions that would only allow the incumbent service provider (SP) to manage all <b>vectored</b> <b>lines</b> in a single DSLAM in order to save the full benefits of vectoring. In this paper, we address the issue of compatibility between <b>lines</b> within a <b>vectored</b> group and outside of it, pointing out that there are various solutions that allow reaping the full benefits of vectoring even when multiple SPs are allowed to share the lines in a cabinet, which is the typical case where Sub-Loop Unbundling (SLU) is permitted by the regulator. We conclude that there are no technical reasons for arguing in favor of imposing restrictions on SLU, a very harsh limitation to competition that would severely damage competitive SPs and penalize subscribers.

5000|$|To {{describe}} the complex projective space in an analogous manner requires a generalization {{of the idea}} of <b>vector,</b> <b>line,</b> and direction. Imagine that instead of standing in a real Euclidean space, the artist is standing in a complex Euclidean space Cn+1 (which has real dimension 2n+2) and the landscape is a complex hyperplane (of real dimension 2n). Unlike the case of real Euclidean space, in the complex case there are directions in which the artist can look which do not see the landscape (because it does not have high enough dimension). However, in a complex space, there is an additional [...] "phase" [...] associated with the directions through a point, and by adjusting this phase the artist can guarantee that he typically sees the landscape. The [...] "horizon" [...] is then the space of directions, but such that two directions are regarded as [...] "the same" [...] if they differ only by a phase. The complex projective space is then the landscape (Cn) with the horizon attached [...] "at infinity". Just like the real case, the complex projective space is the space of directions through the origin of Cn+1, where two directions are regarded as the same if they differ by a phase.|$|E
