5|$|Carly Beth Caldwell is a naive, timid and gullible 11-year-old {{girl who}} is afraid of pretty much everything. Thus, she is a {{constant}} target for pranks, jokes and tricks, most of them being inflicted on her by Steve Boswell and Chuck Greene at Walnut Avenue Middle School. In the opening chapter, Carly Beth and Sabrina discuss what costumes {{they are going to}} wear for Halloween, and Carly Beth is tricked by Steve into eating a sandwich containing a live worm. Horrified, Carly Beth flees and vows revenge. After school, she goes home and finds her mother has made her a silly duck costume for Halloween, and also a <b>very</b> <b>realistic</b> plaster of Paris model of Carly Beth's head. When she goes to her room, the duck costume seemingly comes alive and attacks Carly Beth. It turns out it is her younger brother, Noah, playing another trick on her. Sabrina calls, and they discuss the school science fair.|$|E

The pre-war hubs were smooth {{and after the}} war, there was a raised part {{in the center of}} the hub. Tracks on the tanks and the 162a Light Dragon Artillery Tractor were done with wire-link {{sprocket}} chain wrapped around the hubs. This gave a mechanical, but not <b>very</b> <b>realistic,</b> appearance to the tracks. With the Anti-Aircraft Gun, the side panels folded and not only did the gun swivel 360 degrees, but it could be moved from level to about a 50-degree angle upward.

25|$|There {{are some}} depictions of chariots among the petroglyphs in the {{sandstone}} of the Vindhya range. Two depictions of chariots {{are found in}} Morhana Pahar, Mirzapur district. One depicts a biga {{and the head of}} the driver. The second depicts a quadriga, with six-spoked wheels, and a driver standing up in a large chariot box. This chariot is being attacked. One figure, who is armed with a shield and a mace, stands in the chariot's path; another figure, who is armed with bow and arrow, threatens the right flank. It has been suggested (speculated) that the drawings record a story, most probably dating to the early centuries BCE, from some center in the area of the Ganges–Yamuna plain into the territory of still Neolithic hunting tribes. The <b>very</b> <b>realistic</b> chariots carved into the Sanchi stupas are dated to roughly the 1st century.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were <b>very</b> <b>realistic</b> within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

40|$|A new shading {{model for}} linear light source is presented. It {{accounts}} for both diffuse reflection and specular {{reflection of the}} illuminated surface. By regarding a linear light source as a directional rectangular light source with infinitesimal width, a simple formula is derived for calculating the diffuse reflection component. The specular reflection component is represented by an integration taking Phong's specular model as the kernel and evaluated by a linear approximation. Finally, an efficient shadow detection algorithm for linear light source is proposed. The images rendered with the shading model are <b>very</b> photo <b>realistic...</b>|$|R

N Chandra scored a hat-trick {{at the box}} office with his first three films, Ankush (1986), Pratighaat (1987) and Tezaab (1988). Ankush has earned the status of a cult classic over time, and the ending scene which symbolizes their hanging in front of the India Gate has received much attention. The film is one of the <b>very</b> first <b>realistic</b> depictions of inner city adolescents growing up in an atmosphere of social and economic deprivation.|$|R
25|$|To Spain and the Teutonic {{countries}} of Europe {{we look for}} the most important object of church decoration, the retable; the Reformation accounting for the absence in England of any work of this iec kind. The magnificent altar-piece in Schleswig cathedral was carved by Hans Bruggerman, and consists, like many others, {{of a number of}} panels filled with figures standing some four or five deep. The figures in the foremost rows are carved entirely separate, and stand out by themselves, while the background is composed of figure work and architecture, etc., in diminishing perspective. The panels are grouped together under canopy work forming one harmonious whole. The genius of this great carver shows itself in the large variety of the facial expression of those wonderful figures all instinct with life and movement, In France few retables exist outside the museums. In the little church of Marissel, not far from Beauvais, there is a retable consisting of eleven panels, the crucifixion being, of course, the principal subject. And there is a beautiful example from Antwerp in the Muse Cluny, Paris; the pierced tracery work which decorates the upper part being {{a good example of the}} style composed of interlacing segments of circles so common on the Continent during late Gothic times and but seldom practised in England. ln Spain the cathedral of Valladolid was famous for its retable, and Alonso Cano and other sculptors frequently used wood for large statuary, which was painted in a <b>very</b> <b>realistic</b> way with the most startlingly lifelike effect. Denmark also possessed a school of able wood-carvers who imitated the great altar-pieces of Germany. A very large and well-carved example still exists in the cathedral of Roskilde. But besides these great altarpieces tiny little models were carved on a scale the minuteness of which staggers the beholder. Triptychs and shrines, etc., measuring but a few inches were filled in with tracery and figures that excite the utmost wonder. In the British Museum there is such a triptych (Flemish, I 511); the center panel, measuring an inch or two square, is crowded with figures in full relief and in diminishing perspective, after the custom of this period. This rests on a semicircular base which is carved with the Lord's Supper, and is further ornamented with figures and animals. The whole thing inclusive measures about 9 in. high, and, with the triptych wings open, 5 in. wide. The extraordinary delicacy and minuteness of detail of this microscopic work baffle description. There is another such a piece, also Flemish, in the Wallace collection, which rivals that just referred to in rni& applied talent. For, marvellous as these works of art are, they fail to satisfy. They make ones eyes ache, they worry one as to how the result could ever have been obtained, and after the first astonishment one must ever feel that the same work of art on a scale large enough for a cathedral could have been carved with half the labor.|$|E
500|$|While {{the near}} lifelike {{appearance}} {{of the characters in}} the film was well received, some commentators felt the character renderings fell into the trap that many robotics scientists refer to as the [...] "uncanny valley".
