40|$|Declustering is a {{technique}} to distribute data sets over multiple disks so that future retrievals can be well balanced over the disks and be performed in parallel. Although disk heterogeneity often exists in systems like clusters, most work on declustering has focused only on homogeneous environments. In this work, we investigate the declustering problem for a heterogeneous disk environment using <b>virtual</b> <b>servers,</b> and propose novel approaches for deciding the number of <b>virtual</b> <b>servers</b> and the mapping between <b>virtual</b> <b>servers</b> and physical disks. Our experimental results show that by combining our algorithm for choosing the number of <b>virtual</b> <b>servers</b> with a greedy algorithm for mapping <b>virtual</b> <b>servers</b> to disks, users can expect range query retrieval performance within 4 % of the optimum achievable in practice on average, in all configurations studied. Compared to the intuitively natural approach to the problem based on randomly assigning <b>virtual</b> <b>servers</b> to physical disks, this represents an improvement of 8 – 31 % in average fetch ratio, {{as well as a}} 21 – 42 % reduction in the standard deviation of retrieval performance for small queries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Load {{balancing}} is {{a critical}} issue for the efficient operation of peer-to- peer networks. With the notion of <b>virtual</b> <b>servers,</b> peers participating in a heterogeneous, structured peer-to-peer (P 2 P) network may host different numbers of <b>virtual</b> <b>servers,</b> and by migrating <b>virtual</b> <b>servers,</b> peers can balance their loads proportional to their capacities. Peers participating in a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) are often heterogeneous. The existing and decentralized load balance algorithms designed for the heterogeneous, structured P 2 P networks either explicitly construct auxiliary networks to manipulate global information or implicitly demand the P 2 P substrates organized in a hierarchical fashion. Without relying on any auxiliary networks and independent of the geometry of the P 2 P substrates, this paper present a novel efficient, proximity-aware load balancing algorithm by using the concept of <b>virtual</b> <b>servers,</b> that is unique in that each participating peer {{is based on the}} partial knowledge of the system to estimate the probability distributions of the capacities of peers and the loads of <b>virtual</b> <b>servers...</b>|$|R

While the latter products support a range of server operating systems, Virtual PC 2007 supports only one variety as host and another as guest; its successor, Windows Virtual PC, supports none. And, whereas <b>Virtual</b> <b>Server</b> and Hyper-V have officially supported select Linux guests since 2006 and 2008, respectively, , no Microsoft release of Virtual PC has officially supported Linux. Nonetheless, a number of Linux distributions do run successfully in Virtual PC 2007, and can be used with the Virtual Machine Additions from <b>Virtual</b> <b>Server</b> (see below). Lastly, while 64-bit host support was introduced with Virtual PC 2007, [...] release has been able to virtualize a 64-bit guest; Microsoft has thus far reserved this functionality for Hyper-V, which runs only on 64-bit (x64) editions of Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, Windows 8/8.1 Pro and Enterprise, and Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Virtualization, i. e., running several virtual com-puters on {{the same}} {{physical}} hardware, is an essential tech-nology in data centers. Since demand for cloud computing services is constantly growing, {{an increasing number of}} data centers are focusing on improving their energy efficiency. This has made energy efficiency of virtualization technologies an important research domain. So far, maximizing performance of virtualization technologies has received a lot of attention in cloud computing industry and several academic studies on performance optimization can be found, too. However, these studies usually focus on improving energy efficiency by applying server consolidation methods. In this paper we focus on energy efficiency of virtualization technologies, i. e., how a virtual service can be made more energy efficient. Our aim is to reduce energy consumption without decreasing the quality of service. We have studied this by performing a large set of measurements with different system settings. We used both synthetic benchmarks and real applications. We found out that energy efficiency depends on 1) the workload of the <b>virtual</b> <b>servers,</b> and 2) the number of <b>virtual</b> <b>servers</b> on the physical server. We noticed that it is more energy efficient to maximize workload of <b>virtual</b> <b>servers</b> and to minimize their number. Additionally, we observed that properly configured idle <b>virtual</b> <b>servers</b> hardly increase energy consumption. Thus, our conclusion is that it is better to load <b>virtual</b> <b>servers</b> heavily or let them run idle.
