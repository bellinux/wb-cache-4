5|$|William Easton, an {{insurance}} executive for Umbrella Health, meets with Debbie, the company's attorney, about Harold Abbott, who succumbed {{to heart disease}} after his coverage request was denied due to an application discrepancy. Hoffman abducts Easton from his office that night and brings him to an abandoned zoo, {{where he and his}} janitor, Hank, awaken in <b>vises</b> designed to tighten around their torsos each time they breathe into oxygen masks strapped to their faces. John himself appears in a videotape and informs William that he has one hour to complete four tests and remove the bombs strapped to his limbs, or he will lose his family. Hank, a heavy smoker, is unable to hold his breath for long and is killed by the vise. William's other tests force him to choose which of his workers to save from various traps, including a hanging room, a steam room, and a shotgun aimed at seats of a carousel. It is shown that John met William at the opening of Jill's clinic and took issue with his formula for deeming policyholders worthy of coverage. After his cancer was diagnosed, John's coverage request for an experimental Norwegian treatment was rejected by William.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} {{categories}} of vise (vice in UK English sp.) : <b>vises</b> {{on the end of}} the bench and <b>vises</b> on the front of the bench. End <b>vises</b> (also called 'tail vises') are usually mounted on the right side of the bench for right-handed workers. They can typically hold work in two ways: between the jaws and along the top of the bench using moveable 'dogs' in place of jaws. Not all benches have tail <b>vises.</b> A front vise (also called 'face vise' or 'shoulder vise') is typically mounted on the left front side of the bench. They may be used for holding a board to be edge jointed, or sometimes for sawing out dovetails and the like.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} use for exotic woods in bench {{construction}} is for auxiliary parts {{such as oil}} cups, bench dogs, vise handles, sawing stops and the parts of wooden <b>vises.</b>|$|E

50|$|It {{is normal}} {{to have two}} rows of holes, with pairs of holes {{parallel}} to the <b>vise</b> so that one has four clamping points.Benches that have a tail <b>vise</b> and a face <b>vise</b> might have two sets of bench dog holes {{so that it is}} possible to clamp in this way from either <b>vise.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cercle Sportif <b>Visé</b> was a Belgian {{football}} club {{from the city}} of <b>Visé</b> in the province of Liège. The club played its home matches at Stade de la Cité de l'Oie in <b>Visé.</b> They were nicknamed Les Oies (the geese), after the city of <b>Visé</b> nickname. On 28 October 2014, the club was declared bankrupt.|$|R
25|$|Many of the {{commercial}} European benches have a front vise that uses a wooden jaw with a metal screw and built-in anti-racking hardware. These <b>vises</b> are also available as inexpensive kits that can be mounted on almost any bench.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the easiest}} face vise to install is the {{self-contained}} iron vise, {{sometimes called the}} 'quick-action' vise (except they are not all quick-action). This tool comes already assembled and only has to be mounted to the bench. Usually, auxiliary wooden jaws are added. The quick-action feature makes setting it much quicker and is quickly taken for granted. Not only are these <b>vises</b> easy to install and use, they are also robust. Their main drawback is the relatively high cost.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} front vise design is the leg vise. It's called a leg vise {{because one of}} the bench's legs is an {{integral}} part of it - usually forming the inside jaw. The outside jaw also goes all the way to the floor - or nearly so. There is a single screw mounted between a quarter and a third of the way down that goes through both jaws with the nut on the back of the leg. Finally, there is some sort of horizontal beam at the bottom to act as a fulcrum. This beam may take the form of a board that can be adjusted by means of holes and pegs, or it can even be another screw. The leg vise is probably the simplest and least expensive of the front <b>vises,</b> and it is very strong.|$|E

500|$|Cancellara {{returned}} {{to compete in}} the road race at the Olympics Games. He was the leading rider of a massive breakaway when he badly negotiated a right turn with about [...] to cover and fell heavily on his right shoulder. He completed the race, finishing approximately five minutes after the winner, the Kazakh Alexander Vinokourov, but was in obvious pain and could not hold his handlebar properly with his right hand. As he crossed the line, he was in tears and was sent to the hospital where it was revealed that he did not suffer any fractures. Two days after the incident, it was announced that {{he would be able to}} defend his Olympic Time Trial title, an event he subsequently finished in seventh. In August, Cancellara announced that he was putting an end to his 2012 season. He required further surgery on his collarbone to get the stabilizing <b>vises</b> out of his body.|$|E
2500|$|Some bench {{designers}} have adapted face <b>vises</b> {{for use as}} tail <b>vises</b> - with differing levels of success. Unfortunately, we {{are most likely to}} find the continental style vise used this way, and it's really least suited to the task. When used as a tail vise it has a strong tendency to [...] "wrack" [...] (twist or distort) because of the side forces. It isn't long before the hardware begins to show wear.|$|E
2500|$|A screw {{is really}} just a wedge in the round. Today, most <b>vises</b> use a big screw to apply the {{clamping}} force. [...] The vise {{is often used to}} hold objects in place when working on a piece.|$|E

It is only about the same distance as it is to Richmond, so we will go straight there. I shall lose a little time, of course; but I can be driven over to Richmond, so it won't be too much. Besides, I can {{put on a pair of}} slippers. That will be a comfort, for my feet feel as if they were in <b>vises.</b> A cup of tea won't be a bad thing, too." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{found an}} English {{carriage}} from Padua at Florence, and hired it {{to bring it}} back again. We travelled post with four horses all the way (from Padua to this place there is a railroad) and travelled all night. We left Florence at half-past six in the morning, and got to Padua at eleven next day--yesterday. The cold at night was most intense. I don't think I have ever felt it colder. But our carriage was very comfortable, and we had some wine and some rum to keep us warm. We came by Bologna (where we had tea) and Ferrara. You may imagine the delays in the night when I tell you that each of our passports, after receiving six <b>visés</b> at Florence, received {{in the course of the}} one night, nine more, every one of which was written and sealed; somebody being slowly knocked out of bed to do it every time! It really was excruciating.|$|E
25|$|The steel quick-action <b>vise</b> doesn't suffer so {{much from}} this problem. With one exception, it {{functions}} well {{on the end of}} the bench. Its main drawback as a tail <b>vise</b> is the distance of the dog from the edge of the <b>vise.</b> Ideally, the dog hole strip should be fairly close to the edge of the bench. This puts your weight more directly over the work and behind the plane, enabling you to put more power and control into the operation with less strain. It is also important to keep the dog holes near the edge so that fenced planes can easily be used. With even a small quick-action <b>vise</b> the dog hole strip is still pretty far from the edge. So if you decide to use a quick-action <b>vise</b> as a tail <b>vise,</b> get the smallest good one you can find.|$|R

25|$|This {{is another}} old design making a {{comeback}} thanks to Lee Valley's Veritas Toolworks. The twin-screw <b>vise</b> was popular during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, particularly with chair makers. The updated Veritas design uses a chain to connect the two screws, keeping them slaved to each other. There is also a provision for decoupling the screws so that tapered work can be held. This design has many {{of the advantages of}} the classic shoulder <b>vise</b> and single screw face <b>vise,</b> with few of the disadvantages. It can also be used effectively as an end <b>vise.</b> The main drawbacks of the twin-screw <b>vise</b> are the expense and the relatively difficult installation.|$|R
60|$|Hotel de Louvre, January 12th.--This {{has been}} a bright day as regards weather; but I have done little or nothing worth recording. After breakfast, I set out in quest of the consul, and found him up a court, at 51 Rue Caumartin, in an office rather smaller, I think, than mine at Liverpool; but, to say the truth, a little better furnished. I was {{received}} in the outer apartment by an elderly, brisk-looking man, in whose air, respectful and subservient, and yet {{with a kind of}} authority in it, I recognized the vice-consul. He introduced me to Mr. ------, who sat writing in an inner room; a very gentlemanly, courteous, cool man of the world, whom I should take to be an excellent person for consul at Paris. He tells me that he has resided here some years, although his occupancy of the consulate dates only from November last. Consulting him respecting my passport, he gave me what appear good reasons why I should get all the necessary <b>vises</b> here; for example, that the vise of a minister carries more weight than that of a consul; and especially that an Austrian consul will never vise a passport unless he sees his minister's name upon it. Mr. ------ has travelled much in Italy, and {{ought to be able to}} give me sound advice. His opinion was, that at this season of the year I had better go by steamer to Civita Veechia, instead of landing at Leghorn, and thence journeying to Rome. On this point I shall decide when the time comes. As I left the office the vice-consul informed me that there was a charge of five francs and some sous for the consul's vise, a tax which surprised me,--the whole business of passports having been taken from consuls before I quitted office, and the consular fee having been annulled even earlier. However, no doubt Mr. ------ had a fair claim to my five francs; but, really, it is not half so pleasant to pay a consular fee as it used to be to receive it.|$|E

50|$|Clamp-on <b>vises</b> are {{basically}} very light-duty bench <b>vises.</b> They usually have smooth jaws for wood, plastic and light metalworking, but some have serrated jaws for getting {{a better grip}} on metal.
