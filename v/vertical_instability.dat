Simulations on models of KSTAR and ITER are performed with varying presence of passive stabilizing structures, including the possibility of superconductive control coils.

This happens because at the 4 : 1 radial resonance region we have several orbits with boxy face-on projections, instead of a few rectangular-like x 1 orbits, which, in a fair fraction of the models studied so far, are unstable in this region. Massive bars are characterized by rectangular-like orbits. However, we find that it is the pattern speed that affects the elongation of the boxy feature most, in the sense that fast bars are more elongated than slow ones. Boxiness in intermediate distances between the centre of the model and the end of the bar can be attributed to x 1 v 1 orbits, or to a combination of families related to the radial 3 : 1 resonance...|$|R
