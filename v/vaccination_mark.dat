40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the behavior of beef calves during the traditional and rational methods (focusing animal welfare). There were observed of 272 Nelore calves submitted to the proceedings of <b>vaccination,</b> <b>marked</b> and dehorn. During observations was measured the numbers of accidents and/or delay during the proceedings {{and if there was}} any difference between male or female. Accident was considered all action that delayed the work and offered any animal or personal risk. Data showed that rational method decrease accidents to animals (58 vs. 24, P < 0. 05), as well reduced the time lost per animal (65. 2 seconds vs. 29. 8 seconds, P < 0. 05). Female calves had more accidents than male calves (59 % vs. 41 %, P < 0. 05). Thus, in conclusion we can affirm that technical animal welfare results in better proceedings and decrease of accidents during proceedings of <b>vaccination,</b> <b>marked</b> and dehorn in calves. </em...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which oral, live-attenuated vaccines protect against typhoid fever are poorly understood. Here, we analyze transcriptional responses after vaccination with Ty 21 a or vaccine candidate, M 01 ZH 09. Alterations in response profiles were related to vaccine-induced immune responses and subsequent outcome after wild-type Salmonella Typhi challenge. Despite broad genetic similarity, we detected differences in transcriptional responses to each vaccine. Seven days after M 01 ZH 09 <b>vaccination,</b> <b>marked</b> cell cycle activation was identified and associated with humoral immunogenicity. By contrast, vaccination with Ty 21 a was associated with NK cell activity and validated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation assays confirming superior induction of an NK cell response. Moreover, transcriptional signatures of amino acid metabolism in Ty 21 a recipients were associated with protection against infection, including increased incubation time and decreased severity. Our data provide detailed insight into molecular immune responses to typhoid vaccines, which could aid the rational design of improved oral, live-attenuated vaccines against enteric pathogens...|$|R

Serological response to <b>vaccination</b> was not <b>marked</b> but was best measured by the whole cell agglutination test or by indirect bacterial agglutination rather than by the passive haemagglutination test. Titres of vaccinates were positively correlated with the degree of pneumonic change following challenge while in nonvaccinated controls, titres were negatively correlated with lung lesions.

40|$|Without therapy, {{most people}} {{infected}} with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) ultimately progress to AIDS. Rare individuals (‘elite controllers’) maintain very low levels of HIV RNA without therapy, thereby making disease progression and transmission unlikely. Certain HLA class I alleles are markedly enriched in elite controllers, with the highest association observed for HLA-B 57 (ref. 1). Because HLA molecules present viral peptides that activate CD 8 + T cells, an immune-mediated mechanism is probably responsible for superior control of HIV. Here we describe how the peptide-binding characteristics of HLA-B 57 molecules affect thymic development such that, compared to other HLA-restricted T cells, a larger fraction of the naive repertoire of B 57 -restricted clones recognizes a viral epitope, and these T cells are more cross-reactive to mutants of targeted epitopes. Our calculations predict that such a T-cell repertoire imposes strong immune pressure on immunodominant HIV epitopes and emergent mutants, thereby promoting efficient control of the virus. Supporting these predictions, in a large cohort of HLA-typed individuals, our experiments show that the relative ability of HLA-B alleles to control HIV correlates with their peptide-binding characteristics that affect thymic development. Our results provide a conceptual framework that unifies diverse empirical observations, and have implications for <b>vaccination</b> strategies. <b>Mark</b> and Lisa Schwartz FoundationNational Institutes of Health (U.

We hypothesized that Mtb PPD-induced IFN- after BCG vaccination would be similar in infants from these 2 countries. Infants were vaccinated with BCG during the first 3 – 13 weeks of life. Three months after BCG vaccination, 51 (100 %) of 51 UK infants had an IFN- response to Mtb PPD, compared to 41 (53 %) of 78 of Malawian infants, in whom responses varied according to their season of birth. We conclude that population differences in immune responses after BCG vaccination are observed among infants, as well as among young adults.

As expected, route of <b>vaccination</b> had a <b>marked</b> effect on immune response, with direct immersion {{resulting in low}} serum antibody levels against S. iniae by ELISA detected 21 days post vaccination at 26 degrees C, whilst a significant response was detected in mucus. A strong specific antibody response was detected in both mucus and serum 21 days following intraperitoneal injection. Fish acclimated in seawater prior to vaccination showed a markedly higher specific mucosal antibody response than sibling fish acclimated in freshwater, regardless of the route of vaccination, whilst the serum antibody response was not affected by salinity. Both mucosal and serum antibodies from fish in seawater and freshwater were capable of binding antigen at salinities similar to full strength seawater in a modified ELISA assay. These results indicate that this euryhaline fish species is riot only able to mount significant specific antibody response in cutaneous mucus, but that these antibodies will function in the marine environment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal {{carriage}} of meningococcus {{or related}} species leads to protective immunity in adolescence or early adulthood. This natural immunity {{is associated with}} mucosal and systemic T cell memory. Whether parenteral Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MenB) vaccination influences natural mucosal immunity is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether parenteral MenB vaccination affects mucosal immunity in young adults and whether this immunity differs from that induced in the blood. METHODS: Otherwise healthy volunteers were immunized with MenB outer membrane vesicle vaccine before and after routine tonsillectomy. Mucosal and systemic immunity were assessed in 9 vaccinees and 12 unvaccinated control subjects by measuring mononuclear cell proliferation, cytokine production, Th 1 /Th 2 surface marker expression, and antibody to MenB antigens. RESULTS: Parenteral <b>vaccination</b> induced a <b>marked</b> increase in systemic T cell immunity against MenB and a Th 1 bias. In contrast, although mucosal T cell proliferation in response to MenB neither increased nor decreased following vaccination, mononuclear cell interferon gamma, interleukin (IL) - 5, and IL- 10 production increased, and the Th 1 /Th 2 profile lost its Th 1 bias. CONCLUSIONS: Parenteral MenB vaccination selectively reprograms preexisting naturally acquired mucosal immunity. As new-generation protein-based MenB vaccine candidates undergo evaluation, {{the impact of these}} vaccines on mucosal immunity in both adults and children will need to be addressed. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The UK {{introduced}} the 7 -valent {{pneumococcal conjugate vaccine}} (PCV 7) into the national vaccination program in September 2006. Previous modelling assumed that the likely impact of PCV 7 on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) {{would be similar to}} the US experience with PCV 7. However, recent surveillance data show a more rapid replacement of PCV 7 IPD cases by non-PCV 7 IPD cases than was seen in the US. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A previous model of pneumococcal vaccination was re-parameterised using data on vaccine coverage and IPD from England and Wales between 2006 and 2009. Disease incidence was adjusted for the increasing trend in reported IPD cases prior to vaccination. Using this data we estimated that individuals carrying PCV 7 serotypes have much higher protection (96 %; 95 % CI 72 %- 100 %) against acquisition of NVT carriage than the 15 % previously estimated from US data, which leads to greater replacement. However, even with this level of replacement, the annual number of IPD cases may be 560 (95 % CI, - 100 to 1230) lower ten years after vaccine introduction compared to what it may have been without <b>vaccination.</b> A particularly <b>marked</b> fall of 39 % in children under 15 years by 2015 / 6 is predicted. CONCLUSION: Our model suggests that PCV 7 vaccination could result in a decrease in overall invasive pneumococcal disease, particularly in children, even in an environment of rapid replacement with non-PCV 7 serotypes within 5 years of vaccine introduction at high coverage...|$|R
40|$|Non-targeted {{effect of}} BCG: Several recent {{studies suggest that}} BCG has {{beneficial}} non-targeted effects on general child survival in low-income countries. Studies {{of the effect of}} BCG on morbidity in humans are scarce; some found a positive effect of BCG and others show no effect. Non-targeted effects of vaccines-possible bias and confounding: The major argument against comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated groups {{is that there is a}} beneficial social selection bias for vaccinated children-the "Healthy vaccinee effect". However, controlling for various social and health-related background factors in the survival analyses had no effect on the estimates, making this source of bias less likely. A more powerful argument that the findings are not due to the healthy vaccinee effect is that differential non-targeted effects of other vaccines have been observed; diphteria-tetanus-pertussiss <b>vaccination</b> has <b>marked</b> negative effects on child survival, whereas measles vaccine has a positive effect in several studies. Several studies have shown better survival for children reacting to their BCG vaccination with a BCG scar or tuberculin skin test reaction (TST). It could be argued that the reacting children were immunologically stronger and therefore more likely to survive-the "Healthy reactor effect". However, recent findings show that a BCG scar and a TST reaction depend to a large extent on the vaccination technique. Hence, the BCG responses may reflect a true vaccine effect and not merely the health status of the children. Since HIV- 1 has been shown to suppress both TST and BCG scar reaction in response to BCG, it is an obvious contributor to the healthy reactor effect, but excluding deaths of children with HIV- 1 infection from analysis did not affect the beneficial effect of having a positive TST. Excluding children exposed to tuberculosis (TB) in the household did not affect the estimates either. Furthermore, there are strong sex-differential effects of BCG in both mortality and morbidity data, BCG being more beneficial for girls. These observations cannot consistently be explained by the healthy vaccinee or healthy reactor effects. Ethical implications: For future TB-vaccine studies, these findings imply that: These recommendations might be considered to delay or to be a too large obstacle for the development and trials of new TB vaccines. However, most of the non-targeted beneficial effects of BCG have been observed in children below 2 years of age, which is not a long follow-up time in a TB-vaccine trial. Furthermore, considering the difficulty in setting the TB diagnose in children and the lack of reliable TB-protection markers, it does not seem unreasonable to argue for monitoring of general morbidity and survival in future TB-vaccine trials...|$|R
40|$|Background. Rotavirus vaccine was {{recommended}} for US infants in 2006. We estimated baseline prevaccine burden and monitored postvaccine trends in gastroenteritis-coded and rotavirus-coded hospitalizations among US children. Methods. We analyzed {{data from the}} State Inpatient Databases (SID) for 29 – 44 US states over a 10 -year period (2000 – 2009) to calculate gastroenteritis and rotavirus-coded hospitalization rates by age group, sex, and region, among children 3 ̆c 5 years of age. By extrapolating observed pre- and postvaccine gastroenteritis hospitalization rates to the US population 3 ̆c 5 years {{and based on the}} 2009 cost of a diarrhea hospitalization, we estimated national reductions in diarrhea hospitalizations and associated treatment costs. Results. The prevaccine (2000 – 2006) annual average gastroenteritis-coded hospitalization rate among children 3 ̆c 5 years of age was 74 per 10 000 (annual range, 71 – 82 per 10 000), and declined to 51 and 50 per 10 000 in 2008 and 2009, respectively (P 3 ̆c. 001). The prevaccine (2000 – 2006) annual average rotavirus-coded hospitalization rate among children 3 ̆c 5 years of age was 15 per 10 000 (annual range, 13 – 18 per 10 000), and declined to 5 and 6 per 10 000 in 2008 and 2009, respectively (P 3 ̆c. 001). The decreases in rotavirus-coded hospitalization rates in 2008 and 2009 compared with rates in prevaccine years were observed among all age groups and US regions. Nationally, during 2008 and 2009 combined, we estimated a reduction of approximately 77 000 diarrhea hospitalizations and approximately 242 million in hospital costs. Conclusions. Since implementation of the US rota-virus <b>vaccination</b> program, a <b>marked</b> reduction in diarrhea hospitalizations and related hospital charges has occurred among US children...|$|R
40|$|Eleven {{different}} preparations {{of influenza}} virus {{were used to}} vaccinate large groups of human beings. The antibody response to these vaccines was measured {{by means of the}} in vitro agglutination inhibition test, and the geometric mean titers of sera taken 2 weeks after vaccination were compared. From these comparisons the following conclusions were drawn: 1. There was a wide individual variation in the antibody response of human beings to the same preparation of influenza virus administrated subcutaneously. The amount of antibody produced by a group with a low prevaccination antibody level was very nearly the same as the amount produced by groups that had higher initial levels. 2. The use of the X strain of distemper virus in the preparation of an influenza vaccine did not enhance the antigenicity of the influenza virus present. 3. Within certain limits the mean antibody response of human beings increased as the amount of virus injected was increased. When large amounts of influenza A virus were given, the antibody response was of the same order of magnitude as that which occurred following actual infection by this virus. 4. When the vaccine was prepared from allantoic fluid, {{there was no significant difference}} in the antibody response of human beings given active virus, formalin-inactivated virus, heat-inactivated virus, or virus inactivated by the drying process. 5. Ground infected chick embryos, when diluted with infected allantoic fluid, gave a greater antibody response than allantoic fluid alone (when the virus remained active). The antigenicity of such a preparation was diminished when the virus was inactivated by formalin. 6. Antibody levels 6 and 9 weeks after <b>vaccination</b> showed a <b>marked</b> drop from the 2 -week postvaccination levels. In a small group the antibody levels at 5 months were still further reduced.

40|$|In Tunisia, rabies {{continues}} to {{be considered as a}} serious public health concern. Very costly mass vaccination of dogs against rabies and expensive post-exposure prophylaxis are prerequisites to maintain a low level of human rabies cases. In Tunisia, the implementation of mass vaccination campaigns at the national level has undoubtedly contributed to the drop of rabies endemicity, but the overall outcome is rather suboptimal. In this investigation, we wanted to estimate the extent of the vaccination coverage in dogs in three Governorates (Manouba, Kassrine and Mednine), by collecting data through questionnaires and interviews relevant to 1470 owned dogs. When the campaign is correctly applied, as in Manouba, almost all the targeted dog population can be reached by parenteral vaccination and an almost elimination of the disease can be evidenced. However, in Kasserine and especially in Medenine, where the vaccination coverage is lower than 31 %, a reservoir for the disease can be maintained. To match the official figures of vaccination coverage, we should update the statistics of the size of dog population which seems to be bigger than what is assumed. In addition, we wanted to assess the level of involvement of the local population with the <b>vaccination</b> campaigns by <b>marking</b> vaccinated dogs with necklaces and establishing later on the vaccination coverage accordingly. The highest levels of vaccination coverage can be reached in the rural regions. Therefore, the low vaccination coverage in rural areas, reported at the national level, is more attributable to the lack of human and financial resources to reach remote regions. We think that rabies control programmes in Tunisia can be successful if vaccination coverage can reach 70 % {{in all parts of the}} country. The achieved vaccination coverage should be estimated after random visits in many parts of the country and by checking valid vaccination certificates...|$|R
40|$|Comprehensive {{immunological}} {{evaluation is}} crucial for monitoring patients undergoing antigen-specific cancer immunotherapy. The identification and quantification of T cell responses is most important for the further development of such therapies. Using well-characterized clinical samples from a high responder patient (TK-f 01) in an NY-ESO- 1 f peptide vaccine study, we performed high-throughput T cell receptor β-chain (TCRB) gene next generation sequencing (NGS) to monitor the frequency of NY-ESO- 1 -specific CD 8 + T cells. We compared these results with those of conventional immunological assays, such as IFN-γ capture, tetramer binding and limiting dilution clonality assays. We sequenced human TCRB complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR 3) rearrangements of two NY-ESO- 1 f-specific CD 8 + T cell clones, 6 - 8 L and 2 F 6, as well as PBMCs {{over the course of}} peptide vaccination. Clone 6 - 8 L possessed the TCRB CDR 3 gene TCRBV 11 - 03 * 01 and BJ 02 - 01 * 01 with amino acid sequence CASSLRGNEQFF, whereas 2 F 6 possessed TCRBV 05 - 08 * 01 and BJ 02 - 04 * 01 (CASSLVGTNIQYF). Using these two sequences as models, we evaluated the frequency of NY-ESO- 1 -specific CD 8 + T cells in PBMCs ex vivo. The 6 - 8 L CDR 3 sequence was the second most frequent in PBMC and was present at high frequency (0. 7133 %) even prior to vaccination, and sustained over the course of <b>vaccination.</b> Despite a <b>marked</b> expansion of NY-ESO- 1 -specific CD 8 + T cells detected from the first through 6 th vaccination by tetramer staining and IFN-γ capture assays, as evaluated by CDR 3 sequencing the frequency did not increase with increasing rounds of peptide vaccination. By clonal analysis using 12 day in vitro stimulation, the frequency of B* 52 : 01 -restricted NY-ESO- 1 f peptide-specific CD 8 + T cells in PBMCs was estimated as only 0. 0023 %, far below the 0. 7133 % by NGS sequencing. Thus, assays requiring in vitro stimulation might be underestimating the frequency of clones with lower proliferation potential. High-throughput TCRB sequencing using NGS can potentially better estimate the actual frequency of antigen-specific T cells and thus provide more accurate patient monitoring...|$|R
40|$|In spring 2013, human infections {{with a novel}} avian {{influenza}} A (H 7 N 9) virus were reported in China. The number of cases has increased with over 200 mortalities reported to date. However, there is currently no vaccine available for the H 7 subtype of influenza A virus. Virus-specific cellular immune responses {{play a critical role}} in virus clearance during influenza infection. In this study, we undertook a side-by-side evaluation of two different adjuvants, Salmonella typhimurium flagellin (fliC) and polyethyleneimine (PEI), through intraperitoneal administration to assess their effects on the immunogenicity of the recombinant HA 1 - 2 subunit vaccine of H 7 N 9 influenza. The fusion protein HA 1 - 2 -fliC and HA 1 - 2 combined with PEI could induce significantly higher HA 1 - 2 -specific IgG and hemagglutination inhibition titers than HA 1 - 2 alone at 12 days post-boost, with superior HA 1 - 2 specific IgG titers in the HA 1 - 2 -fliC group compared with the PEI adjuvanted group. The PEI adjuvanted vaccine induced higher IgG 1 /IgG 2 a ratio and significantly increased numbers of IFN-γ- and IL- 4 -producing cells than HA 1 - 2 alone, suggesting a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 -type cellular immune response with a Th 2 bias. Meanwhile, the HA 1 - 2 -fliC induced higher IgG 2 a and IgG 1 levels, which is indicative of a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 -type profile. Consistent with this, significant levels, and equal numbers, of IFN-γ- and IL- 4 -producing cells were detected after HA 1 - 2 -fliC <b>vaccination.</b> Moreover, the <b>marked</b> increase in CD 69 expression and the proliferative index with the HA 1 - 2 -fliC and PEI adjuvanted vaccines indicated that both adjuvanted vaccine candidates effectively induced antigen-specific cellular immune responses.
