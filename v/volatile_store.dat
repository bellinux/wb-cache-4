40|$|Volatiles {{can have}} a {{substantial}} influence on the constrains and genesis of ore deposit, but are not generally stored in the system afterwards. Small pockets of fluid can however be stored as fluid inclusions. Therefore the study of fluid inclusions {{has contributed to the}} extensive understanding of the behaviour of volatiles in different geological settings, and to the conditions during the formation of the mineral that entrapped the fluid inclusion. The intent of this research is to study the late-magmatic aqueous fluids in the Skaergaard layered gabbro. Both the gabbroic pegmatites and the granophyre masses in the intrusion coexisted with an aqueous solution with the same chemical composition. By using microthermometry it is possible to measure the temperatures at which phase changes happen within a fluid inclusion, which consequently enables the evaluation of the chemical composition and the evolution of the system. Additionally, a geochemical analysis was performed to further assess the magma chamber processes during the crystallization of the intrusion. Samples collected during previous expeditions to Skaergaard were used, and fieldwork was conducted at Vestrahorn to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} granophyre and gabbroic pegmatite. The Skaergaard intrusion drove its own meteoric-hydrothermal circulation system during subsolidus cooling. This resulted in an alteration of the mineral assemblage and possible re-equilibration of the fluid inclusions, without any considerable changes in the chemical composition of the aqueous <b>volatiles</b> <b>stored</b> within the fluid inclusions. The better preserved fluid inclusions correlates with the previous research of the LS, which indicate increased pressure during crystallization as the Skaergaard intrusion was progressively buried by flood basalt.

40|$|Mantle-derived melts and metasomatic fluids are {{considered}} to be important in the transport and distribution of trace elements in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle. However, the mechanisms that facilitate sulfur and metal transfer from the upper mantle into the lower continental crust are poorly constrained. This study addresses this knowledge gap by examining a series of sulfide- and hydrous mineral-rich alkaline mafic–ultramafic pipes that intruded the lower continental crust of the Ivrea–Verbano Zone in the Italian Western Alps. The pipes are relatively small (< 300 m diameter) and primarily composed of a matrix of subhedral to anhedral amphibole (pargasite), phlogopite and orthopyroxene that enclose sub-centimeter-sized grains of olivine. The 1 to 5 m wide rim portions of the pipes locally contain significant blebby and disseminated Fe–Ni–Cu–PGE sulfide mineralization. Stratigraphic relationships, mineral chemistry, geochemical modeling and phase equilibria suggest that the pipes represent open-ended conduits within a large magmatic plumbing system. The earliest formed pipe rocks were olivine-rich cumulates that reacted with hydrous melts to produce orthopyroxene, amphibole and phlogopite. Sulfides precipitated as immiscible liquid droplets that were retained within a matrix of silicate crystals and scavenged metals from the percolating hydrous melt. New high-precision chemical abrasion TIMS U-Pb dating of zircons from one of the pipes indicates that these pipes were emplaced at 249. 1 ± 0. 2 Ma, following partial melting of lithospheric mantle pods that were metasomatized during the Eo-Variscan oceanic to continental subduction (~ 420 - 310 Ma). The thermal energy required to generate partial melting of the metasomatized mantle was most likely derived from crustal extension, lithospheric decompression and subsequent asthenospheric rise during the orogenic collapse of the Variscan belt (< 300 Ma). Unlike previous models, outcomes from this study suggest a significant temporal gap between the occurrence of mantle metasomatism, subsequent partial melting and emplacement of the pipes. We argue that this multi-stage process is a very effective mechanism to fertilize the commonly dry and refractory lower continental crust in metals and volatiles. During the four-dimensional evolution of the thermo-tectonic architecture of any given terrain, metals and <b>volatiles</b> <b>stored</b> in the lower continental crust may become available as sources for subsequent ore-forming processes, thus enhancing the prospectivity of continental block margins {{for a wide range of}} mineral systems. 20 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we report new data on He abundances and isotope ratios (3 He/ 4 He) from gas {{associated}} to some thermal and CO 2 -rich mineral waters in N-Portugal. Collected gas samples are mainly CO 2 -dominant except two sites where gas is N 2 -rich. All the sampling sites {{are characterized by}} exceptionally high helium contents with 3 He/ 4 He ratios, corrected for air contamination, varying considerably from 0. 09 to 2. 68 Ra. In all sites, the 3 He/ 4 He ratios are higher than that typical for stable continental areas thus indicating a variable but not-negligible (up to 30 %) contribution of mantle-derived primordial He. In all the CO 2 -rich waters, CO 2 / 3 He ratios and  13 CCO 2 are comparable with mantle values, thus suggesting a magmatic origin also for CO 2. On the contrary, in the N 2 -rich waters He is mainly radiogenic, and CO 2 is organic in origin. Since no recent volcanic activity is observed in NW Iberia, high 3 He/ 4 He values could be due, at least, to three processes: a) releasing of gas from the local upper mantle through deep extensional fault systems; b) releasing of magmatic volatiles from crustal reservoir(s) formed during past volcanic activity; c) degassing of a subsurface emplaced magma body. Mantle He flux in N-Portugal has been estimated {{to be up to}} 3 orders of magnitude higher than that typical for stable continental areas, thus suggesting, in this area, the presence of a tensional tectonic regime. This implies that mantle gases could migrate upward probably through inherited tectonic structures reactivated by neotectonic activity. The third possible scenario seems to be less plausible since seismic surveys carried out in NW Iberian did not find any significant evidence of mantle intrusion in the crust. The observed spatial variability in mantle-derived contribution could reflect the geometry of the granitic plutons in this area, thus supporting the hypotheses of an upper mantle degassing. Alternatively, it could be the result of a lateral migration of magmatic <b>volatiles</b> <b>stored</b> in a crustal reservoir...|$|R
40|$|Subducting oceanic plates carry a {{considerable}} amount of water from the surface down to mantle depths and contribute significantly to the global water cycle. A part of these <b>volatiles</b> <b>stored</b> in the slab is expelled at intermediate depths (70 - 300 km) where dehydration reactions occur. However, despite the fact that water considerably affects many physical properties of rocks, not much is known about the fluid flow path and the interaction with the rocks through which volatiles flow in the slab interior during its dehydration. We performed thermomechanical models (coupled with a petrological database and with incompressible aqueous fluid flow) of a dynamically subducting and dehydrating oceanic plate. Results show that, during slab dehydration, unbending stresses drive part of the released fluids into the cold core of the plate toward a level of strong tectonic under-pressure and neutral (slab-normal) pressure gradients. Fluids progressively accumulate and percolate updip along such a layer forming, together with the upper hydrated layer {{near the top of the}} slab, a Double Hydrated Zone (DHZ) where intermediate-depth seismicity could be triggered. The location and predicted mechanics of the DHZ would be consistent with seismological observations regarding Double Seismic Zones (DSZs) found in most subduction zones and suggests that hydrofracturing could be the trigger mechanism for observed intermediate-depth seismicity. In the light of our results, the lower plane of the DSZ is more likely to reflect a layer of upward percolating fluid than a level of mantle dehydration. In our models, a 20 - 30 km thick DSZ forms in relatively old oceanic plates without requiring an extremely deep slab hydration prior to subduction. The redistribution of fluids into the slab interior during slab unbending also has important implications for slab weakening and the deep water cycle. We estimate that, over the whole of Earth's history, a volume of water equivalent to around one to two oceans can be stored in nominally anhydrous minerals of the oceanic lithosphere and transported to the transition zone by this mechanism, suggesting that mantle regassing could have been efficient even without invoking the formation of high pressure hydrous minerals...|$|R

Comet Tuttle reveals a truly unusual composition, distinct from that of any comet observed to date at infrared wavelengths. The prominent enrichment of methanol relative to water contrasts the depletions of other molecules, especially C 2 H 2 and HCN. We suggest that the nucleus of 8 P/Tuttle may contain two cometesimals characterized by distinct volatile composition. The relative abundances C 2 /CN, C 2 /OH, and CN/OH in 8 P/Tuttle (measured at optical/near-UV wavelengths) differ substantially from the mixing ratios of their potential parents (C 2 H 2 /HCN, C 2 H 2 /H 2 O, and HCN/H 2 O) found in this work.

50|$|Liquid {{hydrogen}} {{has about}} four times the volume {{for the same amount}} of energy of kerosene based jet-fuel. In addition, its highly <b>volatile</b> nature precludes <b>storing</b> the fuel in the wings, as with conventional transport aircraft. Therefore, most liquid hydrogen aircraft designs store the fuel in the fuselage, leading to a larger fuselage length and diameter than a conventional kerosene fuelled aircraft. This lowers the performance due to the extra wetted area of the fuselage. The larger fuselage size causes more skin friction drag and wave drag. On the other hand, hydrogen is about one-third of the weight of kerosene jet-fuel for the same amount of energy. This means that for the same range and performance (ignoring the effect of volume), the hydrogen aircraft would have about one-third of the fuel weight. For a Boeing 747-400 type aircraft, this would reduce the takeoff gross weight from 800,000 to 600000 lb. Thus, the performance of a hydrogen-fueled aircraft is a trade-off of the larger wetted area and lower fuel weight. This trade-off depends essentially {{on the size of the}} aircraft.|$|R

All provenances revealed uniform photoprotective responses to high solar radiation, including increased de-epoxidation of photoprotective xanthophyll cycle pigments and enhanced emission of volatile monoterpenes. In contrast, we observed differences between provenances in response to drought, where provenances sustaining higher CO 2 assimilation rates also revealed increased water-use efficiency, carotenoid-chlorophyll ratios, pools of xanthophyll cycle pigments, β-carotene and stored monoterpenes. Our results demonstrate that local adaptation to contrasting habitats affected chlorophyll-carotenoid ratios, pool sizes of photoprotective xanthophylls, β-carotene, and <b>stored</b> <b>volatile</b> isoprenoids. We conclude that intraspecific variation in isoprenoid-mediated photoprotective mechanisms contributes to the adaptive potential of Douglas-fir provenances to climate change...|$|R
40|$|Petunia hybrida line W 115 (Mitchell) has {{large white}} flowers that produce a {{pleasant}} fragrance. By applying solid phase micro extraction (SPME) techniques coupled to GC-MS analysis, volatile emission was monitored in vivo using a targeted metabolomics approach. Mature flowers released predominantly benzenoid compounds of which benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, methylbenzoate, phenylethylalcohol, iso-eugenol and benzylbenzoate were most abundant. This emission had a circadian rhythm reaching its maximum at dusk. During petal limb expansion two sesquiterpenes were emitted by the petunia flowers, tentatively identified as germacrene D and cadina- 3, 9 -diene. In vitro {{analysis showed that}} the petal limbs and stigma were the main producers of the benzenoids and sesquiterpenes, respectively. Moreover, comparison of in vivo and in vitro analysis indicated that <b>volatiles</b> were not <b>stored</b> during periods of low emission but rather were synthesized de novo. DNA-microarray analysis revealed that genes of the pathways leading {{to the production of}} volatile benzenoids were upregulated late during the day, preceding the increase of volatile emission. RNA-gel blot analyses confirmed that the levels of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) synthase transcripts increased towards the evening. Our results suggest that the circadian production of volatile benzenoids in petunia W 115 is, at least partly, regulated at the transcript level...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{outcome of}} plant thermogenesis is increased emissions of volatiles that mediate pollinator behaviour. We investigated whether the large increase in emissions, mainly the monoterpene ß-myrcene (> 90 %), during daily thermogenic events of Macrozamia macleayi and lucida cycad cones are due {{solely to the}} influence of high cone temperatures or are, instead, a result of increased respiratory rates during thermogenesis. We concurrently measured temperature, oxygen consumption and ß-myrcene emission profiles during thermogenesis of pollen cones under typical environmental temperatures and during experimental manipulations of cone temperatures and aerobic conditions, all in the dark. The exponential rise in ß-myrcene emissions never occurred without a prior, large increase in respiration, whereas an increase in cone temperature alone did not increase emissions. When respiration during thermogenesis was interrupted by anoxic conditions, ß-myrcene emissions decreased. The increased emission rates are not a result of increased cone temperature per se (through increased enzyme activity or volatilization of <b>stored</b> <b>volatiles)</b> but are dependent on biosynthetic pathways associated with increased respiration during thermogenesis that provide the carbon, energy (ATP) and reducing compounds (NADPH) required for ß-myrcene production through the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. These findings establish the significant contribution of respiration to volatile production during thermogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Headspace {{solid phase}} micro-extraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas {{chromatography}} (GC) {{is a useful}} sample preparation, volatile extraction and separation method for analysis of <b>volatile</b> compounds from <b>stored</b> grain insects and their hosts. However, for using this high-quality analytical method, {{there is a need}} to optimize a range of factors to ensure good extraction efficiency. These factors include fibre selection, column selection and sample preparation. In this paper, six types of polar and non-polar fibre (100 µm PDMS, 85 µm PA, 85 µm CAR/PDMS, 65 µm PDMS/DVB, 50 / 30 µm PDMS/CAR/DVB and 7 µm PDMS) were used to conduct the HS-SPME of volatile chemicals from wheat, wheat flour and two species of stored grain insects Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) and Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius). The results showed that the 50 / 30 µm PDMS/CAR/DVB fibre not only extracted the maximum number of volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), but also captured the largest mass of VOCs for subsequent detection by GC. Optimum sample sealing time, fibre extraction time, desorption time and temperature were 24 h, 4 h, 5 min and 250 °, respectively. The GC results of volatiles from different samples gave different patterns of GC spectrum, which indicated that different volatile compounds were released from the different samples. Therefore, this study provides a detailed sequence of HS-SPME-GC optimization steps that can be applied towards the development of HS-SPME-GC methods to detect stored grain insects...|$|R
40|$|The {{utility of}} chemosensor array (EN) signals of head-space <b>volatiles</b> of aerobically <b>stored</b> pork cutlets as a {{non-invasive}} technique for monitoring their microbiological load was studied during storage at 4, 8 and 12 °C, respectively. The bacteriological {{quality of the}} meat samples was determined by standard total aerobic plate counts (TAPC) and colony count of selectively estimated Pseudomonas (PS) spp., the predominant aerobic spoilage bacteria. Statistical analysis of the electronic nose measurements were principal component analysis (PCA), and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA). Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to model correlation between microbial loads and EN signal responses, the degree of bacteriological spoilage, independently of {{the temperature of the}} refrigerated storage. Sensor selection techniques were applied to reduce the dimensionality and more robust calibration models were computed by determining few individual sensors having the smallest cross correlations and highest correlations with the reference data. Correlations between the predicted and “real” values were given on cross-validated data from both data reduced models and for full calibrations using the 23 sensor elements. At the same time, sensorial quality of the raw cutlets was noted subjectively on faultiness of the odour and colour, and drip formation of the samples. These preliminary studies indicated that the electronic nose technique has a potential to detect bacteriological spoilage earlier or {{at the same time as}} olfactory quality deterioration...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of adaptive functions within analog neural hardware, while certainly promising to enhance system performance, has for long been hindered by technological difficulties {{due to the}} complexity and sensitivity of standard adaptive algorithms. We present a general framework for self-contained adaptation in analog VLSI supporting a broad class of supervised learning and optimization tasks, which largely alleviates the implementation problems by virtue of a robust system approach exploiting statistics and redundancy in stochastic processes. Specifically, the framework includes: i) a perturbative algorithm based on stochastic approximation to optimize a set of parameters in an arbitrary deterministic system, these parameters being adjusted according to global performance evaluations rather than using explicit knowledge about the internal structure of the system; and ii) a scalable and modular CMOS architecture that implements this algorithm, and that additionally provides for embedded long-term dynamic storage of the volatile analog parameter values, quantized locally and refreshed autonomously on capacitors with direct external access in both digital and analog formats. We analyze the convergence and scaling properties of the stochastic algorithm, present on-line versions of the algorithm for supervised learning in dynamical systems, and provide experimental results demonstrating real-time trajectory learning on an analog CMOS chip containing a network of six fully recurrent dynamical neurons. We also include results demonstrating robust long-term retention of locally <b>stored</b> <b>volatile</b> information in analog VLSI using the autonomous refresh technique...|$|R
40|$|The {{driving force}} for Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR) is the {{presence}} of an anaerobic zone that enriches the activated sludge for P-accumulating microorganisms (PAOs). According ro accepted models, PAOs anaerobically <b>store</b> <b>volatile</b> fatty acids (VFAs) as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) utilising polyphosphate hydrolysis as the energy source. For substrates other than VFAs, one hypothesis is that other heterotrophs convert them to VFAs, so acting in favour of PAOs. However, particular glycogen accumulating microorganisms have been described (GAOs), that compete against PAOs being able to store anaerobically many substrates into PHAs, by transforming intracellular carbohydrates (glycogen) into PHAs, as the energy source. In this perspective, the paper presents a summary (with new findings) of a long experimental work to study EBPR processes with a lab-scale Sequencing Batch Reactor fed with different organic substrates (peptone, glucose and acetate, separate or in mixtures). Our results show that EBPR can be obtained with substrates other than VFAs with neither their pre-conversion to VFAs nor their storage as PHA. Moreover, in different periods anaerobic uptake of glucose was possible with and without EBPR. In both cases, the stored polymer was glycogen while the energy source was either polyphosphate hydrolysis or lactic fermentation, respectively. These results are not consistent with the reported behaviour of PAOs or GAOs, so showing that many different mechanisms of anaerobic uptake and storage of substrates can art in Favour of, or against EBPR, Deeper insight on these mechanisms is needed to improve design and operation of EBPR plants...|$|R
