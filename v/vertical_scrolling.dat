5|$|Blazing Lazers, {{known as}} Gunhed in Japan, is a shoot 'em up video game {{developed}} by Hudson Soft and Compile. It {{was released in}} Japan and North America in 1989 for the TurboGrafx-16. It {{is based on the}} Japanese film Gunhed, and the references to the film were removed for the North American release. In the game, a fictional galaxy is under attack by an enemy space armada called the Dark Squadron, and this galaxy's only chance for survival is the Gunhed Advanced Star Fighter, who must destroy the Dark Squadron and its Super Weapons. The gameplay features fast <b>vertical</b> <b>scrolling</b> and a wide array of weapons for the player to use.|$|E
25|$|The New Super Mario Bros. series also {{includes}} elements and ideas originally {{proposed for the}} prototype of this game. The multi-player elements originally proposed, were finally realized in the Wii game, where up to four players can play competitively or co-operatively. This gameplay incorporates the competitive elements from the original Mario Bros., with the platforming of Super Mario Bros. <b>Vertical</b> <b>scrolling</b> multiplayer levels,are frequent in this game and also the other games in the series that followed after the Wii release.|$|E
25|$|Home {{consoles}} of {{the early}} 1980s generally lack hardware support for background scrolling — except for the Atari 2600 (with only <b>vertical</b> <b>scrolling),</b> Atari 5200 and Emerson Arcadia 2001, and notwithstanding Japan's Famicom. Nevertheless, Sierra On-Line released B.C.'s Quest For Tires in 1983 on the ColecoVision and several home computer platforms. The game features large, smooth-scrolling levels and simplistic platform gameplay in which players jump over oncoming pitfalls and obstacles, much like Moon Patrol. Not long after this, a scrolling platform game appeared on the Commodore 64 and Atari 800 computers called Snokie. It began {{to bridge the gap}} between these earlier scrolling arcade-style games and implements a more mature vision of the genre, with uneven terrain and an emphasis on precision jumping.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{how individuals}} categorized on handedness (being {{left or right}} hand dominant) reacted to having the <b>vertical</b> <b>scroll</b> bar of a web browser relocated {{to the left side}} of the screen. The relocation of the <b>vertical</b> <b>scroll</b> bar served as an alternative to the relocation of the prominent left aligned main navigation menu for most websites. Fifteen participants were recruited for the study. Each participant interacted with two versions of a web site in a modified browser to complete a set of ten short tasks. Participants completed tasks by interacting with a traditional and non-traditional vertical browser alignment. Left and right-handed participants were determined to be strikingly different in operation. <b>Vertical</b> <b>scroll</b> relocation produced some interesting results and responses...|$|R

500|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>scrolling</b> {{shooters}} emerged {{around the}} same time. Namco's Xevious, released in 1982, is frequently cited as the first <b>vertical</b> <b>scrolling</b> shooter and, although {{it was in fact}} preceded by several other games of that type, it {{is considered one of the}} most influential. Xevious is also the first to convincingly portray realistic landscapes as opposed to purely science fiction settings. While Asteroids (1979) allowed the player to rotate the game's spacecraft, 1982's highly acclaimed [...] was most influential on subsequent multi-directional shooters.|$|E
500|$|Run and gun (or [...] "run 'n' gun") {{describes}} a shoot 'em up {{in which the}} protagonist fights on foot, perhaps {{with the ability to}} jump. Run and gun games may use side scrolling, <b>vertical</b> <b>scrolling</b> or isometric viewpoints and may feature multidirectional movement.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is built}} on a {{different}} engine than those used for the previously released pinball titles: Pokémon Pinball and Kirby's Pinball Land. It is played in a top-down perspective, with <b>vertical</b> <b>scrolling.</b> Both tables include [...] "flippers, multipliers, bonus targets, and multiballs", which are standard gameplay elements for pinball video games. Objectives for the tables include: performing timed skill shots, earning bonus points, and contending with three balls at once. The game incorporates new features absent from Pokémon Pinball, such as ball traps and triple multiballs.|$|E
50|$|When {{the fine}} {{scrolling}} limit is reached, scrolling continues by resetting the VSCROL value and performing a coarse <b>vertical</b> <b>scroll</b> of the scrolling region.|$|R
5000|$|Blank Mode lines {{cannot be}} {{contained}} within a scrolling region, because Blank Mode line instructions inherently {{do not have}} a <b>Vertical</b> <b>Scroll</b> Modifier bit. (Blank Mode line instructions specify the blank line count using the bits 7 through 5 that function as LMS, HS, and VS Modifiers for [...] "regular" [...] Playfield Mode instructions.) However, a Blank Mode instruction can be used to end a scrolling region and is still subject to the expected scan line height changes per the <b>vertical</b> <b>scroll</b> value.|$|R

500|$|A high-definition (HD) {{version of}} the game, titled Resident Evil HD Remaster, was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One in January 2015. The HD version supports 5.1 surround sound {{as well as a}} resolution of 1080p and a widescreen aspect ratio of [...] Although the original pre-rendered backgrounds have a [...] format, the developers decided against re-rendering them in 16:9 because it would allow players {{to see more of the}} environment than originally intended, thus potentially reducing the sense of immersion and danger. As a result, the developers added a <b>vertical</b> <b>scrolling</b> functionality to the backgrounds, which respond to the movement of the character, to fit the remaster's widescreen aspect ratio. Since the original controls of the game were criticized, the remaster also includes a new control scheme which allows players to move their character in the direction of the analog stick.|$|E
2500|$|The {{center of}} the screen shows a <b>vertical</b> <b>scrolling</b> road with two lanes; the areas {{either side of the}} road are used for scores and instructions. The player's car is driving up the road and every few seconds a donkey will appear at random {{on one side of the}} road at the top of the screen. As the donkey moves down the screen the player can press the space bar to switch between lanes to avoid the donkey. If the car hits the donkey, both car and donkey explode, and parts of the {{graphics}} are scattered to the four corners of the screen to the sound of a short monophonic tune played through the PC speaker, with the word [...] "BOOM!" [...] displayed on the left side of the screen. If the player avoids the donkey, it will scroll off the bottom of the screen, with the words [...] "Donkey loses!" [...] displayed on the right side of the screen, and after a few seconds another will appear. [...] There is never more than one donkey on the screen at any one time.|$|E
2500|$|Sega {{attempted}} to emulate this success with their Alex Kidd series, {{which began in}} 1986 on the Master System with Alex Kidd in Miracle World. [...] It's a platformer that features horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>scrolling</b> levels, the ability to punch enemies and obstacles, and shops where the player can buy power-ups and vehicles. Some of the bosses are fought through a minigame of rock-paper-scissors where others {{you have to fight}} or crash the Sukopako [...] "motorbike" [...] into a pirate bear. The environments are varied, including mountains, caves, oceans, forests, and underwater segments. Another Sega platformer series that began that same year is Wonder Boy. The original Wonder Boy in 1986 was inspired more by Pac-Land than Super Mario Bros, and features skateboarding segments that gives the game a greater sense of speed than other platformers at the time, while its sequel, Wonder Boy in Monster Land, takes the series in a new direction by combining action-adventure and action role-playing elements with traditional platforming. Wonder Boy in turn inspired platformers such as Adventure Island, Dynastic Hero, Popful Mail, and Shantae.|$|E
50|$|This {{register}} specifies {{the distance}} of the <b>Vertical</b> fine <b>scrolling</b> in scan lines. The lowest 4 bits are significant, however the <b>Vertical</b> <b>scroll</b> value should range from 0 to the ANTIC Mode line's scan line height - 1. Scrolling farther than the ANTIC Mode's number of scan lines results in lines of repeated data upsetting the fine scrolling continuity (though, this can also be used as an exploitable behavior).|$|R
