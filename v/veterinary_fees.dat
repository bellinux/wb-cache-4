25|$|Pyometra (or a pus filled womb) ('Pyo' = pus; 'metra' = uterus or womb) is a {{life-threatening}} condition that requires emergency veterinary treatment. The {{risk of a}} non-spayed bitch developing pyometra by age 10 is 25% across all breeds, but can {{be as high as}} 54% in some breeds. The treatment of choice for a closed-pyometra (where the cervix is closed and the pus cannot drain) is admission to hospital, commencement on intravenous fluids and appropriate antibiotics and, once stable enough for the anaesthetic and surgery, emergency removal of the infected pus-filled uterus. Medical management can be attempted if the animal's condition allows (for example {{in the case of an}} 'open' pyometra where the pus drains per-vaginum from the uterus via the open cervix) or dictates (where the animal is too old or otherwise unwell to withstand surgery), if the owner wishes to keep the dog entire to breed or if the owner is unable to afford the <b>veterinary</b> <b>fees</b> associated with surgery. Emergency removal of the infected uterus carries a much higher degree of risk of death than a routine 'spay' operation. The risk of death from in dogs undergoing surgical treatment for pyometra is up to 17%. Thus the risk of death in entire female dogs from a pyometra, even if given correct veterinary attention can be up to 9% by 10 years of age (17% of 54%). This risk is reduced to virtually zero if spayed.|$|E

40|$|This study calculates the {{financial}} {{consequences of the}} bluetongue serotype 8 (BTV 8) epidemics of 2006 and 2007 in the Netherlands. We constructed a deterministic economic model that {{is compatible with the}} Dutch livestock production systems for cattle, sheep and goats. Two hundred cattle farms and 270 sheep farms were infected with BTV 8 in the epidemic of 2006, whereas 30, 417 cattle farms, 45, 022 sheep farms and 35, 278 goat farms were estimated to be infected in the epidemic of 2007. The net costs (costs minus benefits) of the BTV 8 epidemic of 2006 (BT 2006) was estimated at 32. 4 million Euros. The net costs of the BTV 8 epidemic of 2007 (BT 2007) was valued at 164 – 175 million Euros, depending on the mortality and morbidity rates for cattle used. The losses account for 2 %, 10 % and 11 % of the gross value of the primary production within Dutch pasture-based livestock farming that equals 1. 6 billion Euros. Control measures accounted for 91 % of the net costs of the BT 2006, while diagnostic costs represented 7 %. By contrast, for the BT 2007 92 % of the net costs were in the form of production losses and <b>veterinary</b> treatment <b>fees,</b> while only 6 % were related to control measures. Furthermore, the control costs dropped from 29, 630 in BT 2006 to 10, 990 in BT 2007 mainly due to the costly indoor housing that was not obligatory during the BT 2007 epidemic. The cattle sector suffered 88 % and 85 % of the net costs for the BT 2006 and BT 2007, respectively; the highest of all sectors...|$|R

40|$|Nine dairy herds (mean size, 149 cows) with bulk-tank milk {{somatic cell}} counts of 80 % of cows with Dairy Herd Improvement Association linear somatic cell counts >= 4 were {{selected}} for study. Each herd was monitored for 12 consecutive months. Duplicate quarter-milk specimens were collected from each cow for bacteriological culture {{at the beginning of}} lactation, cessation of lactation, and at the time of each clinical episode of mastitis. Streptococcus agalactiae was never isolated and Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from < 1 % of all quarters. There were 554 episodes of clinical mastitis. During the year of study, the incidence rate of clinical mastitis varied from 15. 6 to 63. 7 % of cows among the 9 herds. Mean costs per cow per year in herd for mastitis prevention are given. Mean cost associated with clinical mastitis was $ 107 /episode. Approximately 84 % ($ 90) of the costs attributed to a clinical episode were associated with decreased milk production and non-saleable milk. Costs of medication and professional <b>veterinary</b> <b>fees</b> per clinical episode varied significantly among the 9 herds. Three of the herds did not have a veterinarian to treat a clinical episode of mastitis during the year of study even though 2 of these herds had the first and third highest incidence rates of clinical mastitis. When calculated on a per cow in herd basis, mean costs of $ 40 /cow/year were attributed to clinical mastitis. It is suggested that herds that have effectively controlled mastitis caused by contagious pathogens may still have substantial economic losses as a result of clinical mastitis and that losses and even rates of clinical mastitis may vary considerably among such herds. ...|$|E
40|$|As Hawn (2) says, "insurance {{is about}} risk and peace of mind. " She {{reports that the}} American Humane Society {{supports}} pet insurance because companion animals are able to be treated for disease or accidents that are life-threatening where, otherwise, {{they would have been}} euthanized. For veterinarians, she suggests that pet insurance allows them to practice veterinary medicine "as if it were free. " It is inevitable that pet insurance will grow as a recourse for <b>veterinary</b> <b>fees.</b> This may be a savior to some families whose budget is stretched to the limit at a critical moment in the health care of their cherished pet. We in the veterinary profession have an advantage over other professions. We have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly of insurance, as it applies to human health and dental care. If we work hand-in-hand with our own industries, collectively {{we may be able to}} develop a system that wins for everyone, with fees that allow practice to thrive and growth strategies that accommodate new treatment and diagnostic modalities, as well as consistent and exemplary customer service. The path ahead is always fraught with bumps and potholes. We can be a passive passenger and become a victim of the times or an active driver to steer the profession to a clearer route. Pet insurance is but one of the solutions for the profession; the others are a careful assessment of our fees [...] charging what we are worth, not what we think the client will pay; business management; customer service; leadership of our health care team; lifelong learning; and more efficient delivery systems.

40|$|Surveillance {{systems of}} exotic {{infectious}} diseases aim to ensure transparency about the country-specific animal disease situation (i. e. demonstrate disease freedom) {{and to identify}} any introductions. In a context of decreasing resources, evaluation of surveillance efficiency is essential to help stakeholders make relevant decisions about prioritization of measures and funding allocation. This study evaluated the efficiency (sensitivity related to cost) of the French bovine brucellosis surveillance system using stochastic scenario tree models. Cattle herds were categorized into three risk groups based on the annual number of purchases, given that trading is considered as the main route of brucellosis introduction in cattle herds. The sensitivity in detecting the disease {{and the costs of}} the current surveillance system, which includes clinical (abortion) surveillance, programmed serological testing and introduction controls, were compared to those of 19 alternative surveillance scenarios. Surveillance costs included <b>veterinary</b> <b>fees</b> and laboratory analyses. The sensitivity over a year of the current surveillance system was predicted to be 91 ± 7 % at a design prevalence of 0. 01 % for a total cost of 14. 9 ± 1. 8 million €. Several alternative surveillance scenarios, based on clinical surveillance and random or risk-based serological screening in a sample (20 %) of the population, were predicted to be at least as sensitive but for a lower cost. Such changes would reduce whole surveillance costs by 20 to 61 % annually, and the costs for farmers only would be decreased from about 12. 0 million € presently to 5. 3 - 9. 0 million € (i. e. 25 - 56 % decrease). Besides, fostering the evolution of the surveillance system in one of these directions would be in agreement with the European regulations and farmers perceptions on brucellosis risk and surveillance...|$|E
40|$|Pteridium aquilium is {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} of all the pteridophytes; it is present throughout {{the world with the}} exception of hot and cold desert regions. Originally a component of open woodland commun. ltIes ItS. range has extended markedly as a result of mans' activities. The problems caused by bracken mfestatlOn are many and varied. Bracken infestation can cause considerable loss of revenue for farmers in terms of the reduction in available grazing land and through additional expenses such as <b>veterinary</b> <b>fees</b> and control costs. The quality of grazing is reduced due to the shading out of understorey vegetation. It also competes effectively with Cal/una and other heath and grassland species, at best reducing their cover but in some cases eliminating them. The control of Pteridium aquilinum requires a long-term strategy and when planning to undertake control at least a five year programme should be considered. One of the reasons bracken is so hard to control is its extensive rhizome system that can potentially live for more than 50 years. Segments as small as 9 cm are able to grow. A fundamental limitation in vegetation management and restoration ecology is the ability to predict, with some degree of precision the likely outcome of a proposed treatment across a range of sites. A great deal of money and effort is being placed into controlling invasive weeds as part of international and national policies, for example within the UK agri-environment schemes and Biodiversity Action Plans. One of the major issues highlighted in Pteridium aquilinum control is the high variability in success rates, and a cost-effective control strategy has proved elusive. Alongside this, the need for long-term, fully replicated experiments is often highlighted in restoration ecology. In this thesis long-term, multi-site bracken control experiments were analyzed to assess efficacy of various control treatments and subsequent re-vegetation. The experiments assessed the efficacy of five treatments designed to control Pteridium aquilinum relative to an untreated comparison in a range of contrasting ecological situations. These control treatments were also combined with site-specific treatments designed to restore appropriate heathland or grassland vegetation. In addition two methods of bracken control, bruising and the current manufacturers' guidelines for Asulox application, previously untested in formal experiments were studied. Long-term control of bracken at all sites was best achieved using a continuous cutting treatment, preferably twice per year. As expected re-spraying previously treated bracken with asulam caused a reduction in all bracken response variables at both sites tested. The rate of recovery after ten years of bracken control is dependent of the initial degree of control, which presumably reflects the starting rhizome biomass of the bracken. It, is difficult to develop a one-size-fits-all policy for vegetation restoration within a Pteridiu 11 l aquilinll 11 l control strategy, with analysis finding a considerable number of spatial effects between sites of similar vegetation type and located < 2. 5 km apart. Few bracken control treatment effects were found and where they were detected it was only at single sites. Thus, the development of target vegetation requires a combination of control and restoration treatments that take into consideration the aspects of that site. After only one year of treatment, the results show support for the theory that bruising is less effective than cutting as a mechanical control. All bracken response variables in August and Pteridiul 1 l aquilinll 11 l cover in June increased in the rolled three times per year plots compared with the untreated control, rather than the desired decrease. Bruised fronds were found to remain alive and green for up to seven weeks after the initial bruising treatment, with {{no significant difference between the}} photosynthesis and transpiration rates in bruised and untreated fronds. Even in severely damaged fronds key structures such as the xylem vessels remaining intact, despite extensive damage to other tissues. However there was no evidence of the 'rhizome being bled dry' as none of the bracken control treatments had any impact on the rhizomes.
