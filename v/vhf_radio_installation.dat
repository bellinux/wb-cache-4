40|$|Audio {{watermarking}} (AW) {{technology is}} considered for stealthy information embedding directly into audio signal. Inherent in analog radiotelephone channel interferences against watermarks are analyzed. Robust encoding/decoding algorithms are presented and appropriate project of AW system named as Automatic Radio Telephone Identification System (ARTIS) is proposed. Experimental {{results for the}} practical <b>VHF</b> <b>radio</b> channel are presented. Relating on processing complexity the designed system enables imperceptibly transmit data on a rate up to 260 bit/sec in the standard <b>VHF</b> <b>radio</b> channel. ARTIS provides the full compatibility with the existing <b>radio</b> <b>installation,</b> and doesn’t require replacement of standard VHF transceivers and operational procedures. Besides, automatic identification the system {{may be used in}} the special applications, for example, under the threat of terrorist attack; generally contributes to navigation safety and information security...|$|R
