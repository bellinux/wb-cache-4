40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{mortality}} in children under 5 years in the United States of homicides. Infanticide {{has become one of}} the most common crimes against the person in the United States during the second half of XX - beginning of XXI centuries. This fact contributed to the problem of violent crime against children has been actively developed in American criminology. The following article is devoted to mortality from homicides among children under the age of 5 years old in the United States of America. Statistical reports of the Federal Bureau of Investigation during the period of 1980 - 2013 have been used as an empirical base for research. Carried out a critical analysis of a wide range of research of American specialists in various branches of science (criminologists, sociologists, psychiatrists, physicians), devoted to the problems of infanticide in the United States. The basic parameters of infanticide, the dynamics and characteristics of this type of crime. Revealed a rather complicated dynamics of infanticide in the United States for a designated length of chronological period’s ups and downs in the development of this type of crime. Victimization characteristics of children died of homicides as per sex, age and race have been presented. It is found that among American children under the age of 5 years, the greatest risk of becoming a victim of premeditated murder was in children under the age of 1 year. Generalized characteristics of criminals having committed infanticide during this period of time as per sex, kinship of the <b>victim,</b> <b>means</b> used to murder have been revealed. This study found that during the period under review the chronological development of the United States of persons detained by the police for the murder of a child under the age of 5 years, which is numerically dominated by men. These statistics can be traced in all age groups of persons who have committed infanticide in the United States in the 1980 - 2013 periods. Analysis of statistical sources provided the following social characteristics of mothers who killed their own children: the vast majority come from poor families, are relatively young, lonely, or experienced acute tensions with parents in the period before the birth of the child. The authors have analyzed foreign scientific literature, dealing with motivation and socio-psychological characteristics of mothers who killed their babies and presented some separate guidelines on the prevention of this type of crime. They also analyzed the features of infanticide prevention in the United States, aimed at authorities’ activity in crime reducing throughout the country, and identified positive aspects of criminological experience of American experts and the possibility to use it to study the problems and improve the system of infanticide prevention in Russia...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To address {{posttraumatic}} stress disorder (PTSD) predictors with research focused on the coping styles of traumatized individuals. METHOD: A total of 86 crime <b>victims</b> (<b>mean</b> age 46. 1, standard deviation 17. 6) were assessed at 5 and 11 months post-crime. Disclosure of trauma, social acknowledgement, dysfunctional posttraumatic cognitions, and PTSD symptom severity were assessed by self-reports. RESULTS: Dysfunctional posttraumatic cognitions, disclosure attitudes, and social disapproval correlated positively with PTSD severity. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed the particular value of disclosure attitudes and perceived social disapproval in predicting PTSD symptom severity at 11 months post-crime. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to known predictors of PTSD, disclosure attitudes and social acknowledgement should also be considered. Future research should focus on broader concepts such as the victim's perception of, and interaction with, their social environment, and on the objective factors of social interaction, in addition to intrapersonal processes of posttraumatic recovery...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveHead injury {{caused by}} fan blades is rare among children. We {{analysed}} 14 cases of such injury {{and discuss the}} causes, type of injury and preventive measures. MethodsA retrospective analysis of 14 cases of children who were admitted to the Pediatric Neurosurgical Unit of Hospital Kuala Lumpur after sustaining head injuries caused by fan blades between January 2000 and December 2002 was performed. ResultsThe causes of fan-blade head injury included jumping on the upper bunk of a bunk-bed, climbing on a ladder, climbing up onto a table, and being lifted by an adult. Thirteen patients were injured by ceiling fans and one by falling onto an uncovered table fan. School-aged boys were the predominant <b>victims.</b> <b>Mean</b> patient age was 7. 9 years (range, 1. 0 - 12. 2 years). There was a twin peak incidence of when the accidents occurred: just before lunch {{in the afternoon and}} bedtime at night.

40|$|Background: Serotonin (5 -HT) is an {{important}} neurotransmitter with wide-ranging functions. Its disfunction in {{the central nervous system}} seems to play {{an important}} role in many psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior. The objective of this study was to examine the association between polymorphisms in different serotonin receptor genes (HTR) : HTR 1 A (polymorphism - 1019 C>G), HTR 1 B (polymorphisms 861 G>C and - 161 A>T), HTR 1 F (polymorphism - 78 C>T) and HTR 2 A (polymorphism - 1420 C>T), and serotonin transporter gene (5 -HTT) (polymorphism LPR in promoter and VNTR in the second intron), and completed alcohol-related suicide, as well as between alcohol-dependent suicide victims. Subjects and methods: The study subjects were 373 Slovenian suicide <b>victims</b> (<b>mean</b> age ±SD: 48. 8 ± 17. 7 years) autopsied in the years 2002 through 2005. During autopsy venous blood was drawn, and afterwards DNA extraction and alcoholimetric analysis were performed. Relatives of 79 suicide victims were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire designed according to Slovenian cultural and economic conditions. They provided information about the alcohol abuse of the suicide victims. Amongst the suicide victims were 25 alcohol misusers and 54 non-misusers. Results: Association between polymorphisms in the selected serotonin receptor genes, transporter gene and completed alcoholrelated suicide, as well as between alcohol-dependent suicide victims was not established. Conclusions: Present results suggest that selected polymorphisms of the 5 -HT receptor genes and transporter gene are not involved in genetic susceptibility to completed suicide under acute influence of alcohol or among alcohol-dependent individuals, but further studies in a larger sample are needed...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: – The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{undertake}} a review of selected adult safeguarding policy and guidance documentation to establish the level of guidance provided in relation to financial abuse; identify similarities and differences between the guidance given to professionals working in different contexts; and report gaps or inconsistencies in the guidance given. Design/methodology/approach: – Qualitative documentary content analysis was undertaken to identify key issues and themes in documents selected from 25 local authorities in England. Findings: – Little variation was found in the content of the documents, which were all heavily influenced by “No Secrets” guidance. The victim and perpetrator were largely invisible and there is no reference to the possible medium to long‐term impact of abuse on individuals. There is no research evidence underpinning the use of the notion of “significant harm” when used in the context of adults. In addition, there is no means of comparing safeguarding decisions across different local authorities to evaluate consistency of decisions and outcomes. Research limitations/implications: – The lack of any mechanisms to compare safeguarding decisions and outcomes across local authority areas is a serious limitation of the way safeguarding works. Also, the failure to address the aftercare and support of <b>victims</b> <b>means</b> they are left to manage the psycho‐social consequences. Practical implications: – Safeguarding boards should evaluate the outcomes of interventions in a standardised way to enable comparison. They should also do more to ensure the longer‐term wellbeing of victims. Social implications: – The paper raises awareness of elder financial abuse. Originality/value: – This is the only policy review that focuses specifically on financial abuse...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a comparison of}} the socio-demographic profile of hanging suicides and suicides by other means in Ireland from January 1 st 1980 to December 31 st 2005. Data on 9674 suicides occurring in that time frame was provided by the Central Statistics Office of Ireland (CSO). 4031 (42 %) of these deaths involved suicide by ‘hanging, suffocation or strangulation’ (HSS), with the remainder being suicides by other means. Binary logistic regressions were used to examine six potential risk factors for suicide across the two groups: Gender, marital status, employment in the agricultural sectors, residential location (urban/rural) and age were entered in Block 1 of the analysis, with year of death (pre 1994 vs. post 1994) added in a second block. Results indicate that those dying through hangings were statistically more likely to be male (OR = 3. 1, 95 % CI = 2. 8 – 3. 5), single (OR = 1. 3, 95 % CI = 1. 2 – 1. 4), rural-dwelling (OR = 1. 1, 95 % CI = 1. 0 – 1. 2), agri-employed (OR = 1. 3, 95 % CI = 1. 1 – 1. 4) and to have died since 1994 (OR = 2. 3, 95 % CI = 2. 1 – 2. 5). The magnitude of the group effect was moderate for all but the gender and time period comparisons. Hanging suicide victims (m = 37. 7, sd = 16. 7) were also significantly younger than other suicide <b>victims</b> (<b>mean</b> = 42. 72, sd = 16. 7), although the size of the effect was small (r =. 16).

40|$|Objectives: When autopsy is {{performed}} after sudden {{death of a}} young person, cause of death remains undetermined in 6 - 65 %, which is termed sudden unexplained death (SUD). In these cases molecular autopsy and cardiological and genetic examination in surviving first degree relatives is known to unmask its cause, especially primary arrhythmia syndromes. We explored the yield of family screening in a large series of young SUD victims. Methods: We studied all consecutive families who presented to the cardiogenetics department of our university hospital between 1996 - 2008 for family screening because of ≥ 1 first degree related SUD victim aged 1 - 50 years. In the Netherlands autopsy is not mandatory in these cases, and was not performed in 53. 8 %. It the remainder, autopsy did not reveal a cause of death. First, relatives were questioned on their personal and family medical history and a resting ECG was made. If possible, autopsy of the heart was revised. In most cases, relatives were referred to a cardiologist, who generally performed an exercise test and echocardiography. Other examinations, such as ajmaline drug challenge, Holter monitoring and cardiac MRI, were performed on indication. Genetic analysis of the associated candidate gene(s) was performed in material obtained from the deceased person or in those relatives with clinical abnormalities. Results: Relatives of 115 SUD <b>victims</b> (<b>mean</b> age at death 29. 1 years, 67. 8 % male) were examined. In 52. 6 % events occurred at rest and in 29. 8 % upon exertion. Approximately 16 % of the victims had experienced an unexplained syncope before the event, mainly at exertion, and one victim had survived a previous out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. A mean of 2. 5 (1 - 8) first-degree relatives were examined per family (N= 242). In 28 families another first degree family member age...|$|R

40|$|Background: Studies of the {{consequences}} of major trauma have traditionally focused on mortality rates. The aims of this study were, firstly, to investigate the long-term functional health status in a large, unselected group of severely injured patients and to compare this with normative data, and secondly, to explore relations between functional health status and personal and injury characteristics. Methods: A prospective cohort study was performed at the University Medical Centre Utrecht (a level- 1 trauma centre) in The Netherlands. Consecutive survivors of major trauma (ISS >= 16; > 16 years of age) were included from January 1999 until December 2000. After an average of 15 months (range 12 - 18 months), 335 of the 359 eligible persons (response rate 93 %) participated. Demographic and injury characteristics were retrieved from a hospital-based registration system. Functional health status was measured using the 136 -item Sickness impact profile (SIP). Co-morbidity was assessed at the follow-up examination using a standard list of 26 conditions. Results: Subjects were 249 men and 86 women, mean age 37. 7 years, mean ISS was 24. 9 (S. D. = 10. 6). Almost, three quarters were traffic <b>victims.</b> <b>Mean</b> hospital stay was 25 days (S. D. = 23. 4). Discharge destination was home in 70 % of all subjects. At follow-up, the mean overall SIP score was 9. 3 (S. D. = 10. 1), which means mild to moderate disability. The mean score on the physical function dimension was 7. 2 (S. D. = 9. 8) and that on psychosocial function was 8. 7 (S. D. = 12. 0). Most problems were experienced in the categories of Work, Ambulation, Home Management, Recreation and Pastimes, and Alertness Behaviour. Scores of younger subjects deviated more strongly from the norm scores than those of elderly patients. Type of injury, especially lesions of traumatic brain and spinal cord and extremity injuries, was a predictor of both psychosocial and physical functioning after more than 1 year. The most important predictors, however, were age and co-morbidity. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to enhance understanding of the complexities of restorative justice in cases of terrorism from a victimological perspective. It does so first by analysing what separates terrorism from other forms of crime. The author argues that the main distinction concerns the peculiarly public nature of terrorism, in which {{the attack on the}} direct victims {{is intended to}} influence a (far) larger group of so-called vicarious <b>victims.</b> This <b>means</b> that the public is likely to experience terrorist attacks as attacks on themselves. As a consequence the public can feel entitled to processes of forgiveness which in turn can conflict with the direct victims’ own experience. To illuminate this issue the paper proposes a novel distinction in third party forgiveness processes: between public forgiveness, i. e. forgiveness relating to the public wrongfulness inherent in crime, and vicarious forgiveness, i. e. the public’s experience of forgiveness itself. The complexities for restorative justice after terrorism can be then be viewed in terms of the tensions between the direct victims’ private and the publics’ vicarious forgiveness processes...|$|R
