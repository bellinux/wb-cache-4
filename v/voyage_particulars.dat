If she {{understood}} “my sailing” to mean “how this <b>particular</b> <b>voyage</b> had gone”, {{it suggests that}} she wasn't particularly satisfied with it. If she understood it to mean “all the sailing I've ever done”, it could mean {{the same as the}} first; however, she could alternatively be saying: “this one went fine, but it really doesn't show any growth in my capacities”. Even if we knew that she meant the first interpretation (this <b>particular</b> <b>voyage),</b> {{we have no way of}} telling, without asking further, whether she was referring to all of the activities involved in getting the boat to where it is now, or whether she had in mind specifically the physical process of sailing, as opposed to the other skills, for example of provisioning, rigging, navigation, and so forth. This is, of course a problem that is generic to rating scales; we draw attention to it here because, curiously, it has been largely overlooked hitherto in the literature on career success.|$|R
60|$|So, {{not being}} a liner, the Highlander of course did not have very ample {{accommodations}} for cabin passengers.

50|$|The objects {{acquired}} {{reflect the}} fact that the Hawaiians initially treated Cook as a god and presented him with high status goods such as feathered capes, hats, ornaments and images. As this was a point of first contact between Europeans and Hawaiians, a thriving trade developed, and a large number of artefacts, mostly those that were carried or worn, were brought back to England.

50|$|Cartel ships, in {{international}} law in the 18th and the 19th centuries, were ships employed on humanitarian <b>voyages,</b> in <b>particular,</b> to carry prisoners for exchange between places agreed upon {{in the terms of}} the exchange. While serving as a cartel, a ship was not subject to capture. However, if it engaged in commerce or warlike acts such as carrying official dispatches or messengers, it lost its character of inviolability and would then be subject to capture. The cartel protection extended to the return voyage. Furthermore, the prisoners being taken for exchange were under an obligation not to engage in hostilities towards their captors. If they were to capture the cartel ship, they would have no rights to salvage, and the owner of the vessel, if it were a ship from their country, would have no right to reclaim the vessel.|$|R
30|$|Of course, {{one could}} avoid this trap by being {{specific}} in the question: {{instead of asking}} about “her sailing”, one could have asked about “the way she handled this <b>particular</b> <b>voyage</b> in its totality”. But, typically, this is not done when career success is being measured, as witness the items listed above: the first item is not: “I am satisfied with the success  I  have achieved in my career as a public accountant, taking into account everything  I  do as an accountant but ignoring my life outside accountancy”.

5000|$|The main {{practical}} {{limit to}} the use of a gravity assist maneuver is that planets and other large masses are seldom in the right places to enable a <b>voyage</b> to a <b>particular</b> destination.

40|$|Sylvie Lacroix : Sir Joseph Banks and Scientific expeditions. Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Society for 42 years (1778 - 1820), ceaselessly {{sponsored}} naturalists on naval expeditions {{of exploration}} organised by the British government. He {{had created a}} model of scientific efficiency, above all in botany, and of cooperation between scientists and Royal Navy sailors when he took part, at his own expense, in Cook's first voyage; he {{was accompanied by a}} team of 8, chosen by himself, which included Dr Solander, a pupil of Linnaeus. The Admiralty, although at first dubious, put him in charge of organisation and then of exploiting the results of all collection of natural science specimens on <b>voyages,</b> in <b>particular</b> those of Flinders and Vancouver. Until his death in 1810 he was seen as the spiritual heir of Cook, and thanks to him the Admiralty never questioned the presence of non-Navy scientists, like Darwin later on, on its ships.

5000|$|There {{are legal}} {{differences}} between a bareboat charter {{and other types}} of charter arrangements, commonly called time or voyage charters. In a voyage or time charter, the charterer charters the ship (or part of it) for a <b>particular</b> <b>voyage</b> or for a set period of time. In these charters the charterer can direct where the ship will go but the owner of the ship retains possession of the ship through its employment of the master and crew. In a bare-boat or demise charter, on the other hand, the owner gives possession of the ship to the charterer and the charterer hires its own master and crew. The bare-boat charterer is sometimes called a [...] "disponent owner". The giving up of possession of the ship by the owner is the defining characteristic of a bareboat or demise charter.|$|R

6000|$|However, a warm savory {{steam from}} the kitchen served to belie the {{apparently}} cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh! sweet friends, hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuits, and salted pork cut up into little flakes! the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty <b>voyage,</b> and in <b>particular,</b> Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment.

40|$|Even as sea {{writing in}} antebellum America might have aspired to {{literary}} exploration—and possession, the ocean, as Hester Blum has noted, is a ‘landscape than cannot be tangibly possessed’. The of its waters gives the sea a formless, elusive quality, and its apparently material surface hides unfathomable and ultimately ungraspable depths. The {{view from the}} masthead, moreover, offered sailors a vast barren, monotonous panorama: rather than discovery, this vantage point showed nothing—only watery emptiness. On the other hand, sea voyages were inherently circular—they ended where they had started. Whaling <b>voyages,</b> in <b>particular,</b> were non-linear and non-teleological. Or, rather, their telos— the whale—was in perpetual motion, and the whaleship circumnavigated the slippery oceanic landscape in his chase. The concern with how these ontological features of seafaring reflect, and are reflected by, the epistemology of sea narratives will broadly frame my paper. In particular, I propose {{to look at the}} final vortex in Moby-Dick as an image that happily captures these aspects of seafaring—and of sea writing: elusiveness and circuitousness, and, at once, to point at how such aspects, and their blending, eloquently embody psychic trauma. A sea vortex—‘a circular movement of water with a vacuum at the center’, in Paul Brotdkorb’s words—echoes the spiral-like experience of working-through trauma; the ceaseless revolving around an event that cannot be known, since it was not grasped as it occurred, according to Cathy Caruth’s formulation. In turn, I will contend, this vortical image is an apt trope for Moby-Dick’s own circuitous form, visually replicating the convoluted process of working through its narrator’s trauma. Therefore, I will explore the ways in which, in his meandering, digressive tale, Ishmael—and, with him, the reader—seems to be revolving the vortex in order to gain mastery over the unclaimed experience of his lonely survival...|$|R

He gave a comprehensive account of his <b>voyage,</b> most <b>particulars</b> of which have already been incorporated in this history, and he insisted greatly on the importance of the discovery of Veragua. He gave it as his opinion, that here were the mines of the Aurea Chersonesus, whence Solomon had derived such wealth for the building of the Temple. He entreated that this golden coast might not, like other places which he had discovered, be abandoned to adventurers, or placed under the government of men who felt no interest in the cause. [...] "This is not a child," [...] he adds, [...] "to be abandoned to a step-mother. I never think of Hispaniola and Paria without weeping. Their case is desperate and past cure; I hope their example may cause this region to be treated in a different manner." [...] His imagination becomes heated. He magnifies the supposed importance of Veragua, as transcending all his former discoveries; and he alludes to his favorite project for the deliverance of the Holy Sepulchre: [...] "Jerusalem," [...] he says, [...] "and Mount Sion, are to be rebuilt by the hand of a Christian. Who is he to be? God, by the mouth of the Prophet, in the fourteenth Psalm, declares it. The abbot Joachim [181] says that he is to come out of Spain." [...] His thoughts then revert to the ancient story of the Grand Khan, who had requested that sages might be sent to instruct him in the Christian faith. Columbus, thinking that {{he had been in the}} very vicinity of Cathay, exclaims with sudden zeal, [...] "Who will offer himself for this task? If our Lord permit me to return to Spain, I engage to take him there, God helping, in safety." ...|$|R
