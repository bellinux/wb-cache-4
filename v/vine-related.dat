25|$|Harmonia axyridis (the {{harlequin}} ladybird) is {{an example}} of how an animal might be partly welcome and partly harmful. It was introduced into North America from Asia in 1916 to control aphids, but is now the most common species, outcompeting many of the native species. It has since spread to much of western Europe, reaching the UK in 2004. It has become something of a domestic and agricultural pest in some regions, and gives cause for ecological concern. It has similarly arrived in parts of Africa, where it has proved variously unwelcome, perhaps most prominently in <b>vine-related</b> crops.|$|E
40|$|The {{context of}} this paper is {{agricultural}} remote sensing imagery. Its objective is to propose a blind framework for the partial unmixing of multi or hyperspectral images. This framework relies on a linear mixing model with physical constraints related to the positivity and the dependence of the mixing coefficients. It hinges on three steps. The first step is a non-constrained source separation operation using Independent Component Analysis. Then, a <b>vine-related</b> source is selected by comparing the various sources to a rough vegetation index map. Finally, a fuzzy clustering algorithm is applied to the vine-like source to provide a soft classification of pixels into vine and non-vine pixels, i. e. a vine abundance map. The entire framework is successfully applied to hyperspectral CASI data acquired on vineyards. Results are provided which allows discussing the relevance and the capabilities of the approach...|$|E
40|$|A multivariate {{clustering}} approach {{combined with}} geomatics {{was applied to}} delineate and define homogeneous zones (terroir units) within the premium Denomination of Guaranteed Origin Colline Teramane winegrowing area, in the Teramo Province, Italy. A geographical information system (GIS) architecture {{was set up to}} incorporate the main factors affecting the geographical differentiation of land capability. <b>Vine-related</b> environmental indices and parameters were interpolated and incorporated in the GIS. A principal component analysis followed by a multivariate clustering algorithm was applied to obtain a continuous topography climate map, in which each cluster represented a homogeneous zone or terroir unit. Terroir units were further characterized by overlaying the topography climate map with land-use information and a geologic map of the same area. This territory classification provides a useful framework for further hypotheses testing, in particular vine interaction with environment and new cultivar suitability. Moreover, the approach represents a potential tool for rational territory management and land-use planning. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|In {{wine-growing}} regions, zoning studies define areas {{according to}} their potential to produce specific wines and also identify the key drivers behind their variability and optimize vineyard management for sustainable viticulture. However, delineation of homogeneous zones is difficult because of the complex combination of factors which could affect zone classifications. One possibility to capture potential variability {{is the use of}} natural environmental properties as they are related to success in grape growing. With the aim of characterizing the spatial variability of the main <b>vine-related</b> environmental variables and determining different zones, climate and topographical data were obtained for Extremadura (southwestern Spain), an important wine region. Firstly, accurate maps of all climate indices were generated by using regression-kriging as the most suitable algorithm in which exhaustive secondary information on elevation was incorporated, and maps of topography-derived variables were obtained using GIS (Geographical Information System) tools. Secondly, principal component analysis and multivariate geographic classification were used to define homogeneous classes, resulting in three zones. Each zone was further characterized by overlaying the zonation map with a geology map and all enviromental layers. It was obtained that although a wide part of the Extremaduran territory has warm climate characteristics, the zones have different viticultural potential and a high proportion of the region lays on suitable substrate. This zonation in Extremadura is the basis for further zoning studies at more detailed field scale and the modeling of vineyard response to climate change...|$|E
