The first known human victim of <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> died 21 May 1995 and 10 months later in March 1996 the British government acknowledged there is a link between the human disease and the cattle disease. The European Commission announced a worldwide ban on British beef exports and by April 1996 the British government responded with a plan to slaughter all cattle over the age of 30 months.

50|$|Simms {{was born}} in Belfast in 1984 and was, by all accounts, an {{athletic}} teenager who excelled at football and had undergone trials with the Northern Ireland International squad. He initially displayed symptoms between May and September 2001 of a disease which was consistent with either Multiple Sclerosis or vCJD. The doctor who first examined him, Dr. Mark McClean, later said It was either multiple sclerosis or <b>variant</b> <b>C.J.D.,</b> I told them that I thought it was M.S. because I hoped to God that's what it was. From diagnosis to death (depending on a varying amount of circumstances), patients with vCJD are given a life-expectancy of between six months and two years.

40|$|Kuru is an {{acquired}} human prion disease that primarily affected the Fore linguistic {{group of the}} Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea. The central clinical feature of kuru is progressive cerebellar ataxia and, {{in sharp contrast to}} most cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), dementia is a less prominent and usually late clinical feature. In this regard, kuru is more similar to <b>variant</b> <b>CJD,</b> which also has similar prodromal symptoms of sensory disturbance and joint pains in the legs and psychiatric and behavioural changes. Since {{a significant part of the}} clinicopathological diversity seen in human prion disease is likely to relate to the propagation of distinct human prion strains, we have compared the transmission properties of kuru prions with those isolated from patients with sporadic, iatrogenic and <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> in both transgenic and wild-type mice. These data have established that kuru prions have prion strain properties equivalent to those of classical (sporadic and iatrogenic) CJD prions but distinct from <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> prions. Here, we review these findings and discuss how peripheral routes of infection and other factors may be critical modifiers of the kuru phenotype...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{experience}} of caring for people with the new diseases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) by hospice services. The experiences of the hospice staff and carers of five people, who had died, or were dying, {{as a result of}} <b>variant</b> <b>CJD,</b> at three different hospice sites in the South of England were explored. Data from four focus groups and 11 interviews, with hospice staff (included health care assistants, nurses, doctors and social workers) and family members, plus hospice patient records were analysed. Media material was also examined and used to inform the study. The thesis offers a theoretical explanation of these experiences developed through grounded theory methodology using an emergent fit design. It describes the event of the admission into the hospice service of a person with a new disease, that of <b>variant</b> <b>CJD,</b> and how the dying experience of these people was managed by both in-house and community hospice teams, 'Open systems' theory is used to assist in analysis and interpretation of the participant experiences, and as a means of 'contextualising' the hospice service. The hospice is presented as a metaphorical container within which dying is processed, and where the primary task of the organisation had a different emphasis and focus, depending on individual perspectives of participants. A theory of 'dealing with the unknown' was developed to explain the impact of this new disease on system equilibrium. The disease was a novelty and influenced admissions into the service and responses to the disease by others. It engendered the need for staff to use controlling practices to maintain the system balance. There were paradoxes between the practices of in-house and community teams, and between in- house and family member 'understanding' of how care was managed. The experience of caring for people with <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> was also profoundly humbling for participants. Humility was identified {{as a response to the}} realisation of limitations in relieving the suffering of people with <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> and their families. The study demonstrated change over time, where hospice staff moved from not knowing to becoming knowledgeable about managing the care of the person with <b>variant</b> <b>CJD.</b> The theory is complimented by and builds on existing theories of hospice practice...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The glycoprofile of {{pathological}} {{prion protein}} (PrP res) {{is widely used}} as a diagnosis marker in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and is thought to vary in a strain-specific manner. However, that the same glycoprofile of PrP res always accumulates in the whole brain of one individual has been questioned. We aimed to determine whether and how PrP res glycosylation is regulated in the brain of patients with sporadic and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Methods: PrP res glycoprofiles in four brain regions from 134 patients with sporadic or <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> were analyzed {{as a function of}} the genotype at codon 129 of PRNP and the Western blot type of PrP res. Results: The regional distribution of PrP res glycoforms within one individual was heterogeneous in sporadic but not in <b>variant</b> <b>CJD.</b> PrP res glycoforms ratio significantly correlated with the genotype at codon 129 of the prion protein gene and the Western blot type of PrP res in a region-specific manner. In some cases of sCJD, the glycoprofile of thalamic PrP res was undistinguishable from that observed in <b>variant</b> <b>CJD.</b> Interpretation: Regulations leading to variations of PrP res pattern between brain regions in sCJD patients, involving host genotype and Western blot type of PrP res may contribute to the specific brain targeting of prion strains and have direc...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{outbreaks}} of iatrogenic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) from cadaveric {{human growth hormone}} and dura mater are winding down and, like the only other environmentally acquired form of CJD (<b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> due to infection with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy), iatrogenic disease seems to have reached its high water mark during the 1990 s. The total number of cases has reached 405, and the diminishing number of new cases is due to extremely long incubation periods from infections acquired before 1985 (up to 23 years for dura mater and 36 years for growth hormone). Although no cases associated with surgical or other invasive procedures have been identified {{during the past several}} decades, the recent discovery of three transfusion-associated <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> infections has provoked new concerns about the possibility of further secondary transmissions from operative procedures as well as blood and tissue donations. Therefore, at least in those countries in which <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> has occurred, precautionary measures must continue for the indefinite future. NEUROLOGY 2006; 67 : 389 – 393 Five years have passed since the last review of iatrogenic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), and although the total number of cases has increased from 267 to 405 (table 1), the downward trend that was alread...|$|E

40|$|Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) {{surveillance}} {{relies on}} autopsy and neuropathologic evaluation. The 1990 – 2000 CJD autopsy rate in California was 21 %. Most neurologists were comfortable diagnosing CJD (83 %), but few pathologists felt comfortable diagnosing CJD (35 %) or performing autopsy (29 %). Addressing obstacles to autopsy {{is necessary to}} improve CJD surveillance. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are rare, progressively fatal, neurodegenerative illnesses.

40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{international}} {{study of}} the epidemiologic characteristics of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) was established in 1993 and included national registries in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. In 1997, the study was extended to Australia, Austria, Canada, Spain, and Switzerland. METHODS: Data were pooled from all participating countries for the years 1993 to 2002 and included deaths from definite or probable CJD of all etiologic subtypes. RESULTS: Four thousand four hundred forty-one cases were available for analysis and included 3, 720 cases of sporadic CJD, 455 genetic cases, 138 iatrogenic cases, and 128 variant cases. The overall annual mortality rate between 1999 and 2002 was 1. 67 per million for all cases and 1. 39 per million for sporadic CJD. Mortality rates were similar in all countries. There was heterogeneity {{in the distribution of}} cases by etiologic subtype with an excess of genetic cases in Italy and Slovakia, of iatrogenic cases in France and the UK, and of <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> in the UK. CONCLUSIONS: This study has established overall epidemiologic characteristics for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) of all types in a multinational population-based study. Intercountry comparisons did not suggest any relative change in the characteristics of sporadic CJD in the United Kingdom, and the evidence in this study does not suggest the occurrence of a novel form of human bovine spongiform encephalopathy infection other than <b>variant</b> <b>CJD.</b> However, this remains a possibility, and countries currently unaffected by <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> may yet have cases...|$|E
40|$|CREUTZFELDT–JAKOB DISEASE (CJD) IS THE FIRST major {{challenge}} {{that the blood}} system has faced since {{the completion of the}} Krever inquiry in 1997.

40|$|Background: A {{polymorphism}} at codon 129 of the {{prion protein}} gene (PRNP) {{is the only}} well-known genetic risk factor for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). However, there is increasing evidence that other loci outside the PRNP open reading frame might {{play a role in}} CJD aetiology as well. Methods: We studied tau protein gene (MAPT) haplotypic variations in a population of sporadic and <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> patients. We tested 6 MAPT haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs) in a Dutch population-based sample of sporadic CJD (sCJD) patients and a cognitively normal control group of similar age distribution. We genotyped the same polymorphisms in two other sample groups of sCJD cases from Italy and the UK. In addition, we compared MAPT haplotypes between sCJD and <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> (vCJD) patients. Results: Single locus and haplotype analyses did not detect any significant difference between sCJD cases and controls. When we compared MAPT haplotypes between sCJD and <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> (vCJD) patients, we found that two of them were represented differently (H 1 f: 8 % in sCJD versus 2 % in vCJD; H 1 j: 1 % in sCJD versus 7 % in vCJD). However, these two haplotypes were rare in both groups of patients, and taking the small sample sizes into account, we cannot exclude that the differences are due to chance. None of the p-values remained statistically significant after applying a multiple testing correction. Conclusion: Our study shows no evidence for an association between MAPT gene variations and sCJD, and some weak evidence for an association to vCJD...|$|E
40|$|The dietary {{exposure}} of the human population to the prions responsible for the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epizooty {{has led to the}} emergence of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). This fatal, untreatable neurodegenerative disorder is a growing public health concern because the prevalence of the infection seems much greater than the disease incidence and because secondary transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion or use of blood products has occurred. A current limitation in <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> risk assessment is the lack of quantitative information on the infectivity of contaminated tissues. To address this limitation, we tested the potential of a transgenic mouse line overexpressing human prion protein (PrP), which was previously reported to propagate vCJD prions. Endpoint titration of vCJD infectivity in different tissues was evaluated by two different methods: (i) the "classical" bioassay, based on the appearance of clinical symptoms and the detection of pathological prion protein in tissues of the inoculated mouse, and (ii) a shortened bioassay based on the detection of the protein in the mouse spleen at defined time points. The two methods proved equally sensitive in quantifying infectivity, even after very-low-dose inoculation of infected material, but the time schedule was shortened from similar to 2. 5 years to similar to 1 year with the spleen bioassay. Compared to the "gold-standard" RIII model routinely used for endpoint titration of vCJD/BSE prions, either method improved the sensitivity by > 2 orders of magnitude and allowed reevaluating the infectious titer of spleen from a vCJD individual at disease end stage to > 1, 000 -fold-higher values. [br/]IMPORTANCE: Here, we provide key reevaluation of the infectious titer of <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> brain and spleen tissues. The highly sensitive, accelerated spleen-based assay should thus constitute a key advance for <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> epidemiological and risk assessment purposes and should greatly facilitate future titration studies, including, for example, those aimed at validating decontamination procedures. The overlooked notion that the lymphoid tissue exhibits a higher capacity than the brain to replicate prions even after low-dose infection raises new questions about the molecular and/or cellular determinant(s) involved, a key issue regarding potent silent carriers of <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> in the lymphoid tissue...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{molecular}} typing of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) {{is based on}} the size and glycoform ratio of protease-resistant prion protein (PrP(Sc)), and on PRNP haplotype. On digestion with proteinase K, type 1 and type 2 PrP(Sc) display unglycosylated core fragments of 21 kDa and 19 kDa, resulting from cleavage around amino acids 82 and 97, respectively. METHODS: We generated anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies to epitopes immediately preceding the differential proteinase K cleavage sites. These antibodies, which were designated POM 2 and POM 12, recognise type 1, but not type 2, PrP(Sc). FINDINGS: We studied 114 brain samples from 70 patients with sporadic CJD and three patients with <b>variant</b> <b>CJD.</b> Every patient classified as CJD type 2, and all <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> patients, showed POM 2 /POM 12 reactivity in the cerebellum and other PrP(Sc) -rich brain areas, with a typical PrP(Sc) type 1 migration pattern. INTERPRETATION: The regular coexistence of multiple PrP(Sc) types in patients with CJD casts doubts on the validity of electrophoretic PrP(Sc) mobilities as surrogates for prion strains, and questions the rational basis of current CJD classifications...|$|E

40|$|How did {{stories about}} BSE and <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> {{come to be}} reported? The thesis takes the {{approach}} that news stories are one information event in a chain of dissemination that stretches {{back to the first}} formulated account. Information events are the material objects constructed at each stage in the chain. They are distinct from but related to, the first formulated account of an event or phenomenon. Structures and their mechanisms guide the construction and dissemination of information events. At each stage in the process of dissemination, information events are strategically predetermined to suit the communicative goals of sources. But resistance is possible, as this research demonstrates. The thesis explores three events: FSE in a cat in May 1990, the link between BSE and <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> in 1996 and the findings of a study on the prevalence of <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> in the UK population led by Dr David Hilton in May 2004. Through quantitative analysis I first explore two information events in the dissemination process: press releases and news reports. I then subject the 2004 event to qualitative analysis through interviews with sources and journalists, facilitating a deeper knowledge of the transformational stages posited. The study is underpinned by a realist assumption that some objective reality is being reported - the physical reality of disease - but applies a weak constructionist approach to the construction of information events. This thesis contends that reality is a crucial conception in the study of news but what that reality is constituted from should always remain elusive, ambiguous and open to question. I contend, however, that one has to know where and how to look for the nearest approximation of it. If we throw away the quest for and belief in reality then we have no defence against the reality constructed for us by powerful elites...|$|E

The risk of iatrogenic transmission of the disease remains a significant threat, given the well documented cases of CJD transmission via surgery, organ transplantation, and blood transfusion. This review discusses our current understanding of the prevalence of <b>variant</b> <b>CJD,</b> the distribution of tissue infectivity, and new methods for the decontamination of surgical instruments.

This study aimed to identify whether previous dental treatment is {{a risk factor for}} development of vCJD. Design: Case control study Methods: Risk factor questionnaires completed by interview with relatives of 130 vCJD patients and with relatives of 66 community and 53 hospital controls were examined by a dental surgeon. Responses regarding dental treatments were analysed. Results: We did not find a statistically significant excess of risk of vCJD associated with dental treatments with the exception of extractions in an unmatched analysis of vCJD cases with community controls (p= 0. 02). However, this result may be explained by multiple testing. Conclusions: This is the first published study to date to examine potential links between vCJD and dental treatment. There was no convincing evidence found of an increased risk of <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> associated with reported dental treatment. However, the power of the study is restricted by the number of vCJD cases to date and does not preclude the possibility that some cases have resulted from secondary transmission via dental procedures. Due to the limitations of the data available, more detailed analyses of dental records are required to fully exclude the possibility of transmission via dental treatment...|$|E
40|$|Creutzfeldt^Jakob disease (CJD) is a {{rare and}} fatal {{neurodegenerative}} disorder with a worldwide incidence of 1 ^ 1. 5 per million. As in other countries, a CJD surveillance unit with a clinical and neuropathological approach was established in Goettingen (Germany) in 1993.

Since 1993, {{there has been an}} increasing incidence of CJD, from 0. 7 in 1993 to 1. 6 in 2005 with a quite stable level since 1998. During this period, the proportion of patients with MVand VV codon 129 genotype rose, possibly because of better identification of atypical subtypes. Six percent of all patients had a PRNPmuta-tion, mainly D 178 N- 129 M (FFI), E 200 K and V 210 I. Iatrogenic CJDwas a rare phenomenon.

With the aim of decreasing the incubation time to fewer than 200 days, we constructed transgenes in which {{one or more of}} the nine human residues in MHu 2 M were changed to mouse. The construct with murine residues at positions 165 and 167 was expressed in Tg(MHu 2 M,M 165 V,E 167 Q) mice and resulted in shortening the incubation time to ≈ 110 days for prions from sCJD patients. The construct with a murine residue at position 96 resulted in lengthening the incubation time to more than 280 days for sCJD prions. When murine residues 96, 165, and 167 were expressed, the abbreviated incubation times for sCJD prions were abolished. <b>Variant</b> <b>CJD</b> prions showed prolonged incubation times between 300 and 700 days in Tg(MHu 2 M) mice on first passage and incubation times of ≈ 350 days in Tg(MHu 2 M,M 165 V,E 167 Q) mice. On second and third passages of <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> prions in Tg(MHu 2 M) mice, multiple strains of prions were detected based on incubation times and the sizes of the protease-resistant, deglycosylated PrPSc fragments. Our discovery of a previously undescribed chimeric transgene with abbreviated incubation times for sCJD prions should facilitate studies on the prion species barrier and human prion diversity...|$|E
40|$|Prion {{diseases}} are incurable neurodegenerative conditions affecting both animals and humans. They may be sporadic, infectious, or inherited in origin. Human prion diseases include Creutzfeldt–Jakob desease (CJD), Gerstmann– Straussler–Scheinker disease, kuru, and fatal familial insomnia. The appearance of <b>variant</b> <b>CJD,</b> and the demonstration that {{is caused by}} strains indistinguishable from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, {{has led to the}} threat of a major epidemic of human prion disease in the UK and other countries where widespread dietary exposure to bovine prions has occurred. This article reviews the history and epidemiology of these diseases, and then focuses on important areas of current research in human prion disorders...|$|E
40|$|Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) and Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker disease (GSS) are {{distinct}} clinicopathological phenotypes of human prion diseases or {{transmissible spongiform encephalopathies}} (TSEs). TSEs arise either spontaneously (sporadic disease forms such as sporadic CJD/sCJD or sporadic fatal insomnia/sFI), by genetic aberration (genetic CJD/gCJD, GSS, fatal familial insomnia/FFI) or acquired by contact with infectious prions from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), causing <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> (vCJD), or – more or less historically – as iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) from invasive medical procedures such as dural or corneal transplantations, cadaveric pituitary hormone preparations or surgical instruments, or from blood and blood products with vCJD prions.

40|$|Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is an {{emerging}} infectious disease {{believed to be}} the human manifestation of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). <b>Variant</b> <b>CJD</b> belongs to a family of human and animal diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). The pathogenesis of TSE is not fully understood, but a modified form of a normal cellular protein plays a central role. Current measures to control vCJD aim to prevent transmission of the infectious agent from animals to humans through food or pharmaceutical products and to prevent transmission from person to person via medical interventions. The anticipated development of preclinical diagnostic tests and treatments for vCJD will create new control options and difficult choices...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{find and}} investigate, retrospectively, as many cases as {{possible}} of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in Sweden dying {{during the period}} 1 January 1985 to 31 December 1996 and to detect any possible case(s) of new <b>variant</b> <b>CJD.</b>  METHODS—The patients were found through computer search of all death certificates in Sweden on which CJD was mentioned, through information from the Swedish neuropathologists, and spontaneous reports from Swedish doctors and hospitals. Data concerning the patients were then collected from patients' case records and from brain histopathology reports.  RESULTS—In total 72 cases of spongiform encephalopathy were confirmed as definite by neuropathology, one of them with Gerstmann-Stäussler-Scheinker disease. In 51 further cases there were no brain pathology data but the diagnosis "probable" (37 patients) or "possible" (14 patients) CJD according to WHO criteria could be made on clinical grounds. There was a variation in number of deaths/year, from a minimum of five (1985) {{to a maximum of}} 16 (1990). Sixty patients died during the period 1985 - 90 and 62 during 1991 - 6. The sex ratio was nearly 1 : 1. Calculated for a population of 8. 6 million (mean of 12 years) in Sweden this gives 1. 18 /million/year. Age {{at the time of the}} presenting symptoms ranged from 34 to 84 years. Only one patient was under 40 at the onset of symptoms. He had a spongiform encephalopathy but prion protein staining was negative. The duration of symptoms that could be attributed to CJD was 6 months or less in 75 cases, 7 - 12 months in 16 cases, 1 to 2 years in 15 cases, and more than 2 years in 16 patients. By definition all patients were demented. Other more common symptoms and signs were aphasia, dysphasia, dysathria, ataxia, myoclonus, pareses of the extremities, rigidity or spasticity, different types of hyperkinesias, and other psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety, and aggressiveness). Less common symptoms were hallucinations (mainly visual), visual defects, sensory symptoms (paraesthesias, itching, or pain), apraxia of swallowing, and disorders of eye movements.  CONCLUSIONS—The incidence, the symptomatology, the age distribution (age in years at onset and at death), and the duration of illness were similar to those of other countries except for the cases of new <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> in the United Kingdom. There is so far no indication of any cases of new <b>variant</b> <b>CJD</b> in Sweden. ...|$|E
