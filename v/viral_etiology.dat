40|$|AbstractIntroductionDuring {{the first}} {{pandemic}} {{wave of the}} influenza A H 1 N 1 2009 virus, morbidity was particularly high in Brazil. Hospitalizations resulting from severe respiratory disease due to suspected influenza-like illness created an opportunity to identify other respiratory viruses causing lower respiratory infections. ObjectiveThe {{purpose of this study}} was to assess <b>viral</b> <b>etiologies</b> among samples collected during the first pandemic wave of H 1 N 1 2009 from hospitalized patients with suspected cases in a Brazilian Sentinel Hospital. Patients and methods: <b>Viral</b> <b>etiologies</b> were investigated in samples from 98 children and 61 adults with fever, cough and dyspnea who were admitted to São Paulo Sentinel Hospital with suspected H 1 N 1 infection. ResultsFrom August to November 2009, in 19. 5 % (31 / 159) of the samples 2009 H 1 N 1 virus was detected with 23 % (14 / 61) in adults (median age 25 years, range: 14 - 55 years) and 18. 4 % (17 / 92) in children (median age 5 years, range: 4 months - 11 years). Among the negative samples, a wide range of causative etiologic agents was identified. Human rhinovirus was the most frequent virus (23. 91 %) in children and human metapneumovirus (11. 48 %) was the second most frequent in adults, following 2009 H 1 N 1 virus (22. 95 %).

30|$|Introduction: There are {{numerous}} causes of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), {{the most common}} of which are bronchial and or pulmonary infections. <b>Viral</b> <b>etiologies</b> may account for 30 % of AECOPD, but this rate is likely underestimated because of the limited performance of the conventional diagnostic tests. Multiplex molecular diagnostic tests may identify several pathogens including viruses and bacteria, from a single respiratory tract sample, with high sensitivity. Using these tests, respiratory viruses are identified in 30 to 60 % of cases, according to the series. The objective of this work was to describe the microbial epidemiology, the management and the outcome of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with moderate to severe AECOPD, in the era of multiplex testing.|$|R

50|$|Green studied {{not only}} adenoviruses but also many other tumor viruses. At the time, it was {{commonly}} hypothesized that inasmuch as tumor viruses cause certain cancers in animal species, {{they might also}} cause cancers in humans. Green embarked on a large study to ask whether human cancers contain tumor virus genes. This study, funded by the National Institutes of Health via the Virus Cancer Program, was {{a major component of}} President Richard Nixon's ‘War on Cancer.’ Green collected over 2500 tumor samples and analyzed them for the presence of different DNA and RNA tumor viruses. Nearly all the samples were negative. These carefully controlled data, which were published in a series of papers, argued strongly against a <b>viral</b> <b>etiology</b> of human cancer. One exception was the detection of papillomavirus DNA in urogenital cancers; Green was probably the first to make this finding, although he was the second to publish it in the scientific literature.|$|E
50|$|Later, Green’s {{research}} {{extended to}} the RNA tumor viruses (tumor inducing viruses with an RNA genome). Before reverse transcriptase was discovered by David Baltimore and Howard Temin in 1970 (work that earned them a Nobel Prize), Green wrote a review predicting that the enzyme must exist in the virion of retroviruses. In the early 1970s, he and his co-workers conducted important studies on the biochemical features of reverse transcriptases of avian and murine RNA tumor viruses. These studies revealed the subunit structure of the enzyme and helped define the polymerase and Ribonuclease H activities inherent with that enzyme. He coupled this basic research to the effort to detect RNA tumor viruses in human cancer. Tremendous effort was directed to the ‘simultaneous detection’ assay in which proteins are extracted from tumor samples, separated by size, and then examined for reverse transcriptase activity. There was angst associated with those studies because {{of the importance of}} the research and because the workers could occasionally detect weak activity. As was later shown, this activity was not due to infection by RNA tumor viruses, but rather to endogenous reverse transcriptase activity. These studies were negative, again arguing against a <b>viral</b> <b>etiology</b> of cancer.|$|E
5000|$|Giulio Flaminio Brunelli was a {{physician}} and a biologist supporter of the humanistic clinical approach. During his medical training he attended several specialised centers, gaining {{a clear understanding of}} the need for an integrated interdisciplinary medicine approach. Still as a medical student, he began an internship as a researcher at the Laboratory of Experimental Pathology (in the Department of General Pathology within the Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Rome). There, under the mentorship of the pathologist Domenico Ruffilli, a pupil of Guido Vernoni, he pursued an extensive research on the <b>viral</b> <b>etiology</b> of leukemia and developed original techniques for the cultivation of tissues, like the micromanipulation and quantitative cytochemistry. A few years later, he became medical assistant in the Laboratory of Cytochemistry, teaching and supervising also the training of undergraduates. In the same period he started the culture and study of the behavior of Rotifer and Paramecium, as he perceived there was a complexity in the ‘psychology ‘ of these living beings. As Brunelli himself stated in one of his lectures: [...] "Back then, Sergei Tschachotin, a senior student of Pavlov, was working as a fellow researcher in my lab; he was studying completely different things, he was conducting experiments on reflexology and conditioning in small animals, such as Rotifers and Paramecium. I was very intrigued, because Tschachotin was able to do with these living beings - that have no specialised nervous structures - things I thought to be typical only of a highly organized nervous system. This affected some of my strong convictions acquired in my work and study of clinical pathology. It dawned on me as obvious, then and possibly even more obvious today, that a living being has no intelligence, but rather it is intelligence and that intelligence is not depending on the existence of a nervous system, but on the contrary, the nervous system {{is a product of the}} intelligence." [...] During the same period Brunelli dedicated himself to the study of Psychodynamic Therapy Dynamic psychology and undertook a personal analysis and training. He became interested in the genetics of some neurosis and this led him to a different field of research with the Institute of Genetics, Faculty of Science, at the University of Rome, under the direction of Giuseppe Montalenti. He took part in an international research project concerning Thalassaemia, Fauvism and enzymatic polymorphisms.|$|E

40|$|Acute {{gastroenteritis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common diseases worldwide. In developed countries, viruses, particularly noroviruses, are recognized as the leading cause. In The Netherlands, the surveillance of gastroenteritis outbreaks with suspected <b>viral</b> <b>etiologies</b> (as determined by Kaplan criteria) was established by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in 1994. This paper presents an overview of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks reported from 1994 through 2005. A minimum epidemiological data set consisting of the associated setting(s), the probable transmission mode, the date of the first illness and the date of sampling, the number of persons affected, and the number of hospitalizations was requested for each reported outbreak. Stool samples were tested for the presence of norovirus, sapovirus, rotavirus, astrovirus, adenovirus, and Aichi virus by electron microscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and/or reverse transcription-PCR. A total of 6, 707 stool samples from 941 gastroenteritis outbreaks were investigated. Noroviruses were detected as the causative agent in 735 (78. 1 %) of the outbreaks, and rotaviruses, adenoviruses, and astroviruses were found to be responsible for 46 (4. 9 %), 9 (1. 0 %), and 5 (0. 5 %) outbreaks, respectively. Among the gastroenteritis outbreaks in which a mode of transmission was identified, most outbreaks (38. 1 %) were associated with person-to-person transmission, and the majority (54. 9 %) of the outbreaks investigated were reported by residential institutions. Since 2002, the total number of outbreaks reported and the number of unexplained outbreaks have increased. Furthermore, the number of rotavirus-associated outbreaks has increased, especially in nursing homes. Despite thorough testing, 115 (12. 2 %) outbreaks suspected of having <b>viral</b> <b>etiologies</b> remain unexplained.

A total of 364 patients were enrolled, of these 83 (22. 8 %) had malaria parasites, 76 (20. 9 %) had presumptive acute dengue infection and among those, 29 (38. 2 %) were confirmed cases. Dengue was more likely to occur in children ≥ 5 years than in < 5 years (OR 2. 28, 95 % CI: 1. 35 - 3. 86). Presumptive acute Chikungunya infection was identified in 17 (4. 7 %) of patients. We observed no presenting symptoms that distinguished patients with Chikungunya infection from those with dengue infection or malaria. Co-infections between malaria and Chikungunya, malaria and dengue fever as well as Chikungunya and dengue were detected.
