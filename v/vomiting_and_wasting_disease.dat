Mononuclear cells formed vascular {{cuffs and}} were disseminated {{in the brain}} parenchyma. A few neurons were surrounded by {{the same kind of}} cells. Virus particles morphologically similar to coronavirus particles were found in the cytoplasm of both chromatolytic light neurons and hyperchromic dark neurons. The particles were in vesicles of distended endoplasmic reticulum and in the hypertrophied Golgi apparatus. Gnobiotic piglets, infected with hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (or <b>vomiting</b> <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>disease</b> virus), a member of the Corona virus group, develop clinical signs o f vomiting and wasting and lesions of encephalitis.

In FVB/N mice, ts 1 -Cas(NS) induced paralytic <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>disease</b> with incidence, severity, and latency similar to that induced by ts 1, but it failed to cause thymic atrophy as severe as that observed in ts 1 -infected mice. Furthermore, thymocytes cultured from ts 1 -Cas(NS) -infected mice died at a much slower rate than those of ts 1 -infected mice. The U 3 substitution in ts 1 -Cas(NS) specifically diminished the ability of the virus to replicate in the thymus, whereas viral replication in the spinal cord was not significantly affected; thus, neurovirulence was not changed. The correlation of reduced thymic atrophy with decreased thymic viral titers and the decreased ability of ts 1 -Cas(NS) to cause thymocyte death in mice suggest strongly that the marked thymic atrophy in ts 1 -infected mice is not an indirect effect occurring secondary to neurodegenerative <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>disease</b> but is a direct cytopathic effect of high-level viral replication in the thymus...|$|R

This modification of the coupled host–pathogen dynamics forms a novel hypothesis to account for dramatic die-backs of Z. marina widely reported elsewhere.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the role of miRNAs by their specific blocking in the CD 4 +CB 45 RBhi T-cell transfer model of chronic experimental colitis. Colitis caused by transfer of WT CD 4 +CD 45 RBhi T cells in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice shares many features with human IBD. Colonic miRNA expression levels were measured at three time points in colitic mice, where a time-dependent upregulation of multiple miRNAs was seen. To inhibit these miRNAs, specific locked-nucleic-acid-modified (LNA) oligonucleotides were administered in further experiments at the moment the mice demonstrated the first signs of colitis. As controls, PBS and a scrambled sequence of anti-miRNA were used. Genome-wide expression analyses were also performed in order to detect candidate target genes of miR- 142 - 5 p, of which inhibition resulted in most effective amelioration of colitis. Anti-miR- 142 - 5 p reduced colitis <b>and</b> related <b>wasting</b> <b>disease</b> when administered in the T-cell transfer model, reflected in reduced weight loss and a lower disease activity index (DAI).
