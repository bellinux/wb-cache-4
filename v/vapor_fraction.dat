40|$|In {{the paper}} [1] three {{polytropic}} {{change of state}} calculation methods for air gases and CO 2 are compared. The conclusions are that the most used formulas can produce with the same input data deviations in terms of polytropic efficiency up to 1. 5 % points even for nearly ideal gases like nitrogen. The paper suggests therefore a recursive algorithm, which is based directly on the classic definition of a polytropic change of state. This definition assumes a constant dissipation rate during an adiabatic change of state. The proposed algorithm can be applied for any gas with an equation of state, which is an unambiguous function of the two variables pressure p and temperature T. The latter condition is not fulfilled by steam in the wetness range because the specific volume v depends not only from p and T {{but also from the}} <b>vapor</b> <b>fraction</b> x. The aim of this paper is the development of an analogous recursive “constant dissipation rate algorithm ” for a two phase mixture assuming equilibrium conditions between the vapor and the liquid fractions.

In this work, quantitative fuel vapor concentrations obtained from multidimensional computations of a diesel spray with three models are compared with measured concentrations in the vapor-phase portion downstream of liquid drop vaporization. The three models employed are a Lagrangian-drop Eulerian-fluid (LDEF) spray model, a gas jet model, and a virtual-liquid source (VLS) model. Comparison of the <b>vapor</b> <b>fraction</b> along the axial centerline during the transient development of the spray shows that the computed values are generally lower than the measured values, and {{the leading edge of}} the computed profiles shows shallower gradients of <b>vapor</b> <b>fraction</b> than in the measured spray. In the case of radial distribution, the peak values of measured and computed vapor fractions agree within 20 % when the profiles are quasi-steady.

40|$|Owing to {{increased}} interest in blended fuels for automotive applications, {{a great deal of}} understanding is sought for the behavior of multicomponent fuel sprays. This sets a new requirement on spray model since the volatility of the fuel components in a blend can vary substantially. It calls for careful solution to implement the differential evaporation process concerning thermodynamic equilibrium while maintaining a robust solution. This work presents the Volvo Stochastic Blob and Bubble (VSB 2) spray model for multicomponent fuels. A direct numerical method is used to calculate the evaporation of multicomponent fuel droplets. The multicomponent fuel model is implemented into OpenFoam CFD code and the case simulated is a constant volume combustion vessel. The CFD code is used to calculate liquid penetration length for surrogate diesel (n-dodecane) -gasoline (iso-octane) blend and the result is compared with experimental data. The liquid penetration length predictions follow the trend of the experiment. There is a decrease in the liquid penetration with increase in proportion of iso-octane (surrogate gasoline) as observed in the experiments. The CFD code is also applied to calculate <b>vapor</b> <b>fraction</b> of individual components in the fuel.

The effects of inlet guide vanes on pump hydraulic performance and cavitation are investigated, where the total <b>vapor</b> <b>fraction</b> of impeller zone (Ftv) is calculated to predict the critical net positive suction head, which is compared with that predicted by efficiency criterion for different flow rates. The influences {{of the development of}} cavitation on internal flow in impeller zone are also investigated.

The continuity equation of the vapor species was employed to simulate the <b>vapor</b> mass <b>fraction</b> in the gas phase. The <b>vapor</b> mass <b>fraction</b> at the interface was predicted by the Clausius-Clapeyron correlation.
