25|$|The {{most common}} {{argument}} {{in support of}} viruses as living organisms is their ability to undergo evolution and replicate through self-assembly. Some scientists argue that viruses neither evolve, nor self- reproduce. In fact, viruses are evolved by their host cells, meaning that there was co-evolution of viruses and host cells. If host cells did not exist, <b>viral</b> <b>evolution</b> would be impossible. This is not true for cells. If viruses did not exist, the direction of cellular evolution could be different, but cells would nevertheless be able to evolve. As for the reproduction, viruses totally rely on hosts' machinery to replicate. The discovery of viral megagenomes with genes coding for energy metabolism and protein synthesis fueled the debate about whether viruses belong in the tree of life. The presence of these genes suggested that viruses were once able to metabolize. However, it was found later that the genes coding for energy and protein metabolism have a cellular origin. Most likely, these genes were acquired through horizontal gene transfer from viral hosts.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: Several {{mathematical}} {{models have}} been investigated for the description of viral dynamics in the human body: HIV- 1 infection is a particular and interesting scenario, because the virus attacks cells {{of the immune system}} that have a role in the antibody production and its high mutation rate permits to escape both the immune response and, in some cases, the drug pressure.

500|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{is important}} in facilitating <b>viral</b> <b>evolution.</b> [...] For example, if the genomes of two viruses with different disadvantageous mutations undergo recombination, then {{they may be able}} to regenerate a fully functional genome. [...] Alternatively, if two similar viruses have infected the same host cell, homologous recombination can allow those two viruses to swap genes and thereby evolve more potent variations of themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Herd {{immunity}} itself acts as {{an evolutionary}} pressure on certain viruses, influencing <b>viral</b> <b>evolution</b> by encouraging the production of novel strains, in this case referred to as escape mutants, {{that are able to}} [...] "escape" [...] from herd immunity and spread more easily. At the molecular level, viruses escape from herd immunity through antigenic drift, which is when mutations accumulate in the portion of the viral genome that encodes for the virus's surface antigen, typically a protein of the virus capsid, producing a change in the viral epitope. Alternatively, the reassortment of separate viral genome segments, or antigenic shift, which is more common when there are more strains in circulation, can also produce new serotypes. When either of these occur, memory T cells no longer recognize the virus, so herd immunity ceases to be relevant to the dominant circulating strain. For both influenza and norovirus, epidemics temporarily induce herd immunity until a new dominant strain emerges, causing successive waves of epidemics. As this evolution poses a challenge to herd immunity, broadly neutralizing antibodies and [...] "universal" [...] vaccines that can provide protection beyond a specific serotype are in development.|$|E
50|$|<b>Viral</b> <b>evolution</b> is an {{important}} aspect of the epidemiology of viral diseases such as influenza (influenza virus), AIDS (HIV), and hepatitis (e.g. HCV).

A second {{objective of this}} study was to analyze associations between vaccine-specific immune responses and epitope mutation rates. HIV- 1 -infected patients on combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) were subjected to immunotherapy by the administration of an autologous dendritic cell-based therapeutic vaccine expressing Tat, Rev, and Nef and subsequent ATI. HIV- 1 genes were amplified and sequenced from plasma RNA obtained before initiation of cART as well as during ATI. Control sequences for virus evolution in untreated HIV- 1 -infected individuals were obtained from the HIV Sequence Database (Los Alamos).

For the first case, the maximum neutralizing activity was for serum collected between two and three months post ALT peak, this activity was still detectable after 30 months.
