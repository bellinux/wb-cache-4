Interacting efficiently with a supplier may require information exchanges, {{which raises the}} concern that sensitive information may be disclosed to rivals. This may be particularly harmful in case of innovative activities, as it {{increases the risk of}} imitation. We show that vertical integration exacerbates this threat of imitation, which de facto degrades the integrated supplier's ability to interact with unintegrated competitors. Vertical integration may thus lead to input foreclosure, thereby raising rivals' cost and limiting both upstream competition and downstream innovation.

We look at a simple model in which this development is explained by increasing competitive pressure from an ‘outside opportunity’, e. g. mobile telephony.

40|$|We analyse {{vertical}} integration {{when there is}} upstream competition and compare outcomes to the case where upstream assets are owned by a single agent (i. e., upstream monopoly). In so doing, we make two contributions to the modelling of strategic {{vertical integration}}. First, we base industry structure – namely, the ownership of assets – firmly within the property rights approach to firm boundaries. Second, we model the potential multilateral negotiations using a fully specified non-cooperative bargaining model designed to easily compare outcomes achieved under upstream competition and monopoly. Given this, we demonstrate that vertical integration can alter the joint payoffs of integrating parties in ex post bargaining; however, this bargaining effect is stronger for firms integrating under upstream competition than upstream monopoly. We also consider the potential for integration to internalise competitive externalities in manner that cannot be achieved under non-integration. We demonstrate that ex post monopolization {{is more likely to}} occur when there is an upstream monopoly than when there is upstream competition. Our general conclusion is that the simple intuition that the presence of upstream competition can mitigate and reduce the incentives for socially undesirable vertical integration is misplaced and, depending upon the strength of downstream competition (i. e., product differentiation), the opposite could easily be the case. <b>vertical</b> integration, <b>foreclosure...</b>|$|R

Second, the Turner Broadcasting channels that increased market shares because of this merger appeared to be foreclosed by Time Warner prior to the merger. The preference for own channels by Time Warner persisted, despite a lower quality of channel bundles in its markets; efficiency gains from the merger were not passed on to consumers. <b>Vertical</b> integration Antitrust <b>Foreclosure...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{result of}} {{neutrality}} of vertical integration for competition postulated by the Chicago School can {{be supported by}} a benchmark model with (1) an upstream monopolist, (2) homogeneous goods downstream and (3) observable (two-part tariff) contracts. The result does not hold however, whenever {{any of the three}} assumptions is relaxed. Rey and Tirole (1999) show that, with secret contracts, vertical integration is profitable and anticompetitive. The present paper shows that, adding an alternative supplier and product differentiation to the benchmark model, the effects of vertical integration depend on the efficiency level of the alternative supplier. When the alternative supply is relatively efficient, we also obtain that vertical integration is profitable and anticompetitive. However, when the alternative supplier is relatively inefficient, vertical integration becomes unprofitable and increases social welfare. <b>Vertical</b> integration, market <b>foreclosure,</b> two-part tariff contracts. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the incentives}} to upgrade input quality in vertically related (network) industries. Upstream investments have a biased {{effect on the}} downstream companies and lead to vertical product differentiation. Different vertical structures such as vertical integration, ownership and legal unbundling lead to different investments. We find that, without regulation, vertical integration and legal unbundling regimes provide highest investment incentives and lead to highest welfare. However, we also find foreclosure in the downstream market if the potential degree of horizontal product differentiation of the entrant is low. Under ownership unbundling, investment incentives are lower but there is never foreclosure of the entrant since this would worsen double marginalisation. When the network operator is subject to a break-even regulation, the investment incentives are crowded out under legal and ownership unbundling whereas they remain nearly unchanged under vertical integration. Welfare and co umer surplus decrease under legal unbundling, but increase under the two other regimes. <b>Vertical</b> Integration, Investment, <b>Foreclosure,</b> Regulation...|$|R
40|$|Vertically {{integrated}} {{firms have}} repeatedly {{been accused of}} abusing a dominant position by refusing to sell the intermediate product to non-integrated downstream producers and thus to practice foreclosure. To evaluate the merit of such an accusation requires an adequate theory of vertical integration which allows to decide whether a refusal to sell follows straightforwardly from profit maximization or is driven by an intent to monopolize. We investigate whether {{in the case of}} successive oligopolies vertical integration is profitable for the participating firms and to what extent cross deliveries between integrated and non-integrated firms can be expected to arise. By contrast to the previous literature where at the downstream level Cournot competition has been assumed to prevail between integrated firms and non-integrated downstream producers, we propose a model where integrated firms and non-integrated upstream suppliers meet in Cournot competition and take as given the inverse demand function for both the final and the intermediate product. Game theory is invoked to examine whether an integrated firm will participate in the intermediate market. If marginal costs at the downstream level are constant and identical as between integrated and non-integrated firms, integrated firms will never wish to sell to non-integrated downstream producers they can, however, be expected to buy from non-integrated upstream suppliers. Utilizing theoretical implications regarding pass through of changes in marginal costs we find empirical evidence supporting the applicability of our model to the gasoline industry in Germany. We finally examine to what extent issues of competition policy and public regulation arise.

Received the The Institute of Competition Law 2015 Concurrences PhD Award. A {{margin squeeze}} is an exclusionary form of abuse of a {{dominant}} position that a vertically integrated firm can implement when it sells its upstream bottleneck input to its downstream competitors. Because it is vertically integrated, the dominant incumbent {{can reduce the}} margin between the input price charged to competitors and the retail price charged to end-users by either raising {{the price of the}} input and/or lowering the price of its retail product/services {{to such an extent that}} the remaining margin of profit is insufficient for its rivals to remain competitive. Although the scenario of margin squeeze seems to be rather simple, the underlying economic and legal theories are not. Consequently, detecting a margin squeeze requires competition authorities to apply a complex imputation test, which in turn requires various methodological choices that can determine the outcome of the investigation. The principal purpose of the dissertation is to determine whether the European Commission's margin squeeze decisions are consistent with EU case law. The dissertation examines two alternative hypotheses. Under hypothesis A, margin squeeze is presented as a deviation from the essential facilities doctrine, which could be seen as an expression of regulatory competition law. Hypothesis B assumes that it constitutes another form of <b>vertical</b> <b>foreclosure,</b> the main question then being under what exact conditions foreclosure is likely in network industries where the margin squeeze doctrine traditionally applies. Two conclusions follow from the analysis. First, margin squeeze constitutes another theory of <b>vertical</b> <b>foreclosure,</b> and accordingly cannot be seen as an unjustified deviation from refusal to deal and essential facilities cases. Second, to ensure that the theory of harm in margin squeeze cases is credible, competition authorities could enhance their current analytical framework by regularly reviewing various additional elements, in particular the extent to which the wholesale product is important for downstream competition...|$|E
