40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review {{literature}} relating to <b>vehicle</b> <b>utilisation,</b> transport optimisation and the implementation of ‘green ’ transport management measures within the freight industry with a view to minimise the negative impact of road freight transport on the environment. Design/Methodology/Approach This report first reviews the key constraints on <b>vehicle</b> <b>utilisation,</b> before examining opportunities to optimise transport operations. Within the remit of this report, three key areas for improved efficiencies within the industry are identified: logistical efficiency, <b>vehicle</b> <b>utilisation</b> and driver training and behaviour. Search terms: green logistics; transport management; vehicle utilisation; transport optimisation. Findings Environmental issues will increasingly influence the way transport managers do their jobs. Currently, there is a growing field of governmental literature offering advice and guidance. Research Limitations/implications The scope of this review is limited by the availability of literature and time. As a broad study, it does not present the full range of literature on the state of green transport management, but attempts to give an overview of the main concerns and areas for improvement. The text and case studies are illustrative of the previous work done in this field. Practical implications This report highlights limitations faced by transport managers in attempting to operate vehicles efficiently and draws together environmentally-related literature that offers guidance to transport managers.

40|$|The {{demand for}} locally {{produced}} food is increasing as global food supply system has considerably affected {{the confidence of}} consumers by increasing tonne-kilometres, food safety risk, environmental impact, and disconnecting local food producers and consumers. However, local food suppliers {{are not in the}} position to compete with large scale food supply systems due to high logistics costs. The overall objective {{of this study was to}} improve the logistics management of local food supply chains. In this thesis, food traceability issues and the local food supply chains were studied based on literature reviews and five case studies in Sweden. The thesis comprises of six papers. Paper I considers food traceability issues. Paper II deals with comparison analysis of small scale abattoir and large scale abattoir in terms of animal supply and meat distribution. Paper III focuses on box-scheme based organic food delivery system, while Paper IV deals with coordination and regional integration in local food delivery system. Papers V and VI consider the case of clustering producers, determining collection centres, and forming coordination and integration within the network and further integration into large scale food delivery systems. The best locations of collection and distribution centres were determined using Centre-of-Gravity and Load-Distance techniques and Geographic Information Systems tools. Optimising food transport routes were done with Route LogiX and ArcGIS network analyst tools. Effective food traceability system is an important tool to be considered as integral part of food logistics system as it facilitates the integrated management of food supply chain as a whole. Compared with large scale abattoirs, the local small scale abattoir could reduce travel distance, time, and emission and could improve animal welfare, meat quality and safety, and customer satisfaction. The integration of logistics managements along with clustering, coordination, and optimisation techniques, could reduce the transport distance, time, trips, and emission, and improve the <b>vehicle</b> capacity <b>utilisation</b> in the local food supply chains. As a consequence of reduced transport distance, number of vehicles and improved <b>vehicle</b> capacity <b>utilisation,</b> negative environmental impacts of local food supply systems could be reduced. The study revealed that the integrated logistics network has implications for improving food traceability, logistics efficiency, food quality and safety, the potential marketing channels, economic benefits, and competitiveness of suppliers; and for attenuating negative environmental impact and promoting sustainable local food systems. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{potential}} impacts of EVs on the Western Australian electricity grid, the {{constraints on the}} system's capacity to supply electricity for EV recharging and the options for managing those potential impacts and constraints. Western Australia is geographically isolated and the electricity network has no interconnection with neighbouring regions. The State energy and vehicle markets are independent of issues occurring in neighbouring states. Western Australia is a relatively clean sample space. This study eliminates uncertainty in vehicle adoption rates from analysis by assuming that all new vehicles are EVs. This gives a worst case scenario in terms of load growth and shows that it will over 200, 000 EVs, which represents 10 % of the fleet, before there is any significant impact on peak demand even if charging behaviours are left unfettered. The study also shows, however, that the electricity supply and transmission industry can achieve significant short- and long-term benefits if vehicle charging behaviours are managed from the outset, through, for example, demand management or structured tariffs. In the short-term, providing incentive for off-peak recharging increases utilisation of existing transmission capacity, and cheaper, more efficient base-load generation infrastructure. In the long-term, investment in more underutilised capacity can be avoided. Electric <b>vehicle</b> Electricity demand <b>Utilisation...</b>|$|R

The findings suggest that while many companies are positive towards the concept of a regional ELM, mixed feelings exist in different sectors, in particular in the haulage industry.

40|$|We study an {{automated}} container terminal in which Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) {{are used to}} internally transport containers and Automated Stacking Cranes (ASCs) to store and retrieve containers. In designing container terminals, the terminal management has to consider the choice for interrelated AGV and ASC dispatching rules and {{the layout of the}} stack. In this paper, we, therefore, examine the joint decision problem of dispatching containers to AGVs, selecting ASCs and the layout of the stock. In choosing a certain combination of dispatching rules and layout, we have considered criteria, such as, unloading times of a ship, number of <b>vehicles</b> required and <b>utilisation</b> of equipment. From this specific study, we can conclude that hardly any differences in unloading times can be obtained if we choose another combination of AGV and ASC dispatching rules. However, savings of approximately 20 % in the number of AGVs can be obtained, if we apply the nearest-AGV-first rule in combination with the cyclic ASC rule. The results of the layout experiments only show small variations in unloading times, but they justify further research to the options for ASCs to span a wider stack. From the sensitivity analysis, it can be concluded that Quay Cranes should be distributed as evenly as possible over the stip and that twin-load AGVs can be used to obtain significant savings in unloading times and up to 50 % reductions in the number of AGVs required.

40|$|This thesis aims at {{developing}} a {{decision support system}} for pallet utilisation in the sheet feeder industry. Furthermore, the research project has focused on providing an improvement to {{the current system of}} distribution of the customer order onto pallets. The overall research objectives are to: (i) Establish {{the state of the art}} in areas related to the project; (ii) Identify the key variables such as pallet sizes, truck sizes, material features and customers’ requirements for building the pallet utilisation model; (iii) Develop an analytical approach and a prototype system to improve the utilisation of the pallets and the truck volume; (iv) Validate the developed model and prototype system through real-life case studies and expert opinions. A combination of research methodology approaches has been employed in this research study. Firstly, a familiarisation stage has been conducted through comprehensive literature review and visits to the sponsoring company. The second phase was to conduct semi-structured interviews with the shop-floor operators and operations directors to have a better understanding of the business needs. This was combined with measurements of the trucks and the pallets and internal documentation from the company. In this stage, the researcher also distributed questionnaires to other sheet feeder companies to know if the system could be applied also to more companies. In the third phase, the data gathered were analysed for the subsequent development of the system. Then the system has been developed following the logic rules obtained by analysing the data. Finally, the developed model and system has been validated, through real-life case studies and expert opinions. The developed analytical model has been implemented in a prototype system. The developed system comprises a knowledge-based system, material handling modules, databases and user interface. The developed system for pallet utilisation encompasses pallet database, truck database and material features databases. The developed model and system has the capability to estimate the number of corrugated cardboard sheets that should be loaded per pallet. Additionally the system predicts the number of sheets per stack and the type of pallet that should be used. The system provides the shop-floor operators with an effective tool for pallet utilisation in order to reduce their decision time. Therefore, the developed system provides cost and time savings in terms of improvements of the pallet and <b>vehicle</b> volume <b>utilisation</b> for the preparation and delivery of the corrugated board product. This system has given to the sponsoring company an improvement of 5 % in the way of orders’ management...|$|R
40|$|With {{the growing}} and more {{accessible}} computational power, {{the demand for}} robust and sophisticated computerised optimisation is increasing for logistical problems. By making good use of computational technologies, the research in this thesis concentrates on efficient fleet management by studying a class of vehicle routing problems and developing efficient solution algorithms. The literature review in this thesis looks at VRPs from various development angles. The search reveals that from the problem modelling side clear efforts are made to bring the classical VRP models closer to reality by developing various variants. However, apart from the real VRP applications (termed as 'rich' VRPs), it is also noticeable that these classical VRP based variants address merely one or two additional characteristics from the real routing problem issues, concentrating on either operational (fleet management) or tactical (fleet acquisition) aspects. This thesis certainly hopes to add {{to one of those}} good efforts which have helped in bringing the VRPs closer to reality through addressing both the operational as well as the tactical aspects. On the solution methodologies development side, the proposed research noted some considerable and impressive developments. Although, it is well established that the VRPs belong to the NP-hard combinatorial class of problems, there are considerable efforts on the development of exact methods. However the literature is full of a variety of heuristic methodologies including the classical and the most modern hybrid approaches. Among the hybrid approaches, the most recent one noted is mat-heuristics that combine heuristics and mathematical programming techniques to solve combinatorial optimisation problems. The mat-heuristics approaches appear to be comparatively in its infant age at this point in time. However this is an exciting area of research which seeks more attention in the literature. Hence, a good part of this research is devoted {{to the development of a}} hybrid approach that combines heuristics and mathematical programming techniques. When reviewing the specific literature on the VRP problems focused in this thesis, the vehicle routing problem with backhauls (VRPB) and the multiple trip vehicle routing problem (MT-VRP), there is not sufficient development on the problem modelling side in terms of bringing these two problems closer to the reality. Hence, to fill the gap this thesis introduces and investigates a new variant, the multiple trip vehicle routing problem with backhauls (MT-VRPB) that combines the above two variants of the VRP. The problem is first described thoroughly and a new ILP (Integer Linear Programming) mathematical formulation of the MT-VRPB along with its possible variations is presented. The MT-VRPB is then solved optimally by using CPLEX along with providing an illustrative example showing the validation of the mathematical formulation. As part of the contribution, a large set of MT-VRPB data instances is created which is made available for future benchmarking. The CPLEX implementation produced optimal solutions for a good number of small and medium size data instances of the MT-VRPB and generated lower bounds for all instances. The CPLEX success may be considered as modest, but the produced results proved very important for the validation of the heuristic results produced in the thesis. To solve the larger instances of the MT-VRPB, a two level VNS algorithm called 'Two-Level VNS' is developed. It was noticed from the literature that the choice of using VNS for the VRPs has increased in recent literature due to its simplicity and speed. However our initial experiments with the classical VNS indicated that the algorithm is more inclined towards the intensification side. Hence, the Two-Level VNS is designed to obtain a maximum balance of the diversification and the intensification during the search process. It is achieved by incorporating a sub-set of neighbourhood structures and a sus-set of local search refinement routines and hence, a full set of neighbourhood structures and a full set of local search refinement routines at two levels of the algorithm respectively. The algorithm found very encouraging results when compared with the solutions found by CPLEX. These findings in this thesis demonstrate the power of VNS yet again in terms of its speed, simplicity and efficiency. To investigate this new variant further, we developed an algorithm belonging to the new class of the hybrid methodologies, i. e., mat-heuristics. A hybrid collaborative sequential mat-heuristic approach called the CSMH to solve the MT-VRPB is developed. The exact method approach produced in Chapter 4 is then hybridised with the Two-Level VNS algorithm developed in Chapter 5. The overall performance of the CSMH remained very encouraging in terms of the solution quality and the time taken on average compared with the CPLEX and the Two-Level VNS meta-heuristic. To demonstrate the power and effectiveness of our methodologies, we tested the designed algorithms on the two special versions of the VRP (i. e., VRPB and MT-VRP) to assess whether they are efficient and dynamic enough to solve a range of VRP variants. Hence the Two-Level VNS and the CSMH algorithms developed to solve the MT-VRPB are adapted accordingly and implemented to solve the two above variants separately. The algorithms produced very competitive results for the benchmark data sets when compared to the best known solutions from the literature. The successful implementations of these algorithms on the three VRP models with only minor amendments prove their generalizability and their robustness. The results in this research show that significant cost savings could be obtained by choosing the right fleet size and better <b>vehicle</b> <b>utilisations</b> with multiple trips and backhauling. Hence, the research proved the justification of studying this interesting combination. Moreover, the problem modelling, efficient algorithm design and implementation, and the research results reveal some vital information and implications from the managerial point of view in terms of making the tactical (fleet acquisition) and the operational (fleet management) decisions in a more informative manner...|$|R

The purpose is to determine how shippers’ {{freight transport}} purchasing processes influence logistical variables. A multiple case study of freight transport purchasing processes was conducted, {{based on interviews with}} transport purchasers and providers. Three causes of influence of shippers’ purchasing processes on logistical variables were found: specific requirements, network structure of transport providers, and scope of contract. Specifications by purchasers, especially time requirements, influence several logistical variables (‘mode used’, ‘length of haul’, ‘load factor’, ‘empty running’, and ‘fuel efficiency’). This paper clarifies the implications of transport purchasing on CO 2 emissions in terms of logistical variables, which are understood in transportation research and practice. It describes the effects of shippers’ requirements on transport providers’ execution of transport. The results provide a foundation for shippers to discuss their influence on logistical variables with transport providers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In current {{transport}} logistics, routing is usually done centrally. A dedicated routing instance solves the optimisation problem {{of finding the}} best solution to handle the current set of orders with the set of available vehicles under constraints such as <b>vehicle</b> <b>utilisation,</b> punctuality etc. Because of the increasing complexity of logistic processes, approaches have been suggested recently which change this centralised routing paradigm towards a distributed approach with autonomous logistic entities (vehicles and goods) deciding on their own. To be able to obtain enough knowledge for reasonable decisions, the logistic entities have {{to communicate with each}} other. For this interaction, the information exchange concept DLRP (Distributed Logistic Routing Protocol) has been proposed before. The work presented in this paper will focus on the aspect of scalability of communication in a DLRP scenario. Message flooding is identified as potential challenge for the scalability of DLRP, and intelligent flooding restrictions to the communication traffic are applied. I...|$|E
40|$|Carsharing, as an {{alternative}} to private vehicle ownership, has spread worldwide in recent years due to its potential of reducing congestion, improving auto utilisation rates and limiting the environmental impact of emissions releases. Along with its growth, the flexibility of carsharing systems also brings complex problems to the operators. One dominant challenge in carsharing systems is to ensure the supply of vehicles can meet the demand of users in a cost-effective manner. This requires accurately predicting users' demand and optimally relocating vehicles in response to demand variations. The two principal areas of this thesis are methods to estimate demand and optimally relocate fleet. From the demand side, this study models users’ <b>vehicle</b> selection and <b>utilisation</b> patterns. Focusing on vehicle selection behaviour, a spatial hazard-based model (SHBM) is proposed to investigate the impacts of users’ socio-demographic attributes and fleet characteristics on their choice set formation behaviour in selecting vehicles. The modelling is achieved by regarding “distance to carsharing vehicle” as a random variable analogous to the duration in conventional hazard-based models. Data collected from the Australian carsharing company GoGet are utilised to calibrate the models. The accelerated failure time model with a log-logistic distribution is found to provide the best fit. Upon making a vehicle selection, users then decide the amount of consumption to allocate to each selected vehicle type. This process involves making multiple discrete choices of continuous amounts and is modelled by the multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) modelling framework. Three MDCEV models considering travel time, mileage, and monetary expenditure as the continuous consumption constraints are developed to estimate the impacts of a set of socio-demographic attributes on user’s vehicle choice and capture the satiation effect with increasing the consumption for each vehicle type. An efficient simulation procedure is applied to evaluate the performance of the three MDCEV models. The results indicate travel time, mileage and expenditure affect users’ vehicle usage pattern in the same way. The findings from these two demand models can be referred to by the operators when determining the most efficient allocation of resources within carsharing systems. From the operation side, the research develops and solves novel models for the vehicle stock imbalance problem in one-way carsharing systems. Previous studies have proposed relocation methods to handle it, but the interdependence between demand and supply has never been considered. The thesis proposes two relocation models to link demand and supply. Both incorporate a discrete choice model (DCM) in an integer linear programming (ILP) model to account for the interaction. The difference between them lies in the DCMs. In the first model, the DCM does not assume users’ demand to be elastic to vehicle availability. The ILP model solves optimal relocation decisions and updates vehicle availability for each station; the DCM then coupled with the updated vehicle availability changes users’ trip demand reciprocally. Built on the first model, the second model extends the DCM by including vehicle availability as a parameter directly affecting demand. In this new framework, demand and supply are linked by vehicle availability: it is the output of the ILP model {{and at the same time}} the input of the DCM. The nonlinearity of the DCM is further linearised through a linearisation approach. Both models are tested in the GoGet network. The results reveal if there is a strong interdependence between demand and supply, the supply has a critical impact on system profit. The core contribution of this thesis is to take the first attempt to understand and optimise carsharing systems considering the interdependency of demand and supply comprehensively...|$|R

40|$|On-demand {{mobility}} services, such as {{bike and}} car sharing, are experiencing {{an exponential growth}} {{and are expected to}} play an essential role in future transportation systems. In addition, car sharing is recognised as a key driving force for the diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs) in urban areas. The impact of a regulated fleet of shared electric cars on the power distribution grid is expected to be significant and very different from that of privately-owned EVs due to: the different mobility patterns (e. g., higher <b>vehicle</b> <b>utilisation,</b> shorter parking times), and the dependence of charging opportunities on the specific layout of the car-sharing station infrastructure.

The availability of reliable vehicle-use data at the household level now enables a more serious effort at amending the imbalance of research effort where the reliance has been predominantly on vehicle choice modelling and gross (exogenous) assumptions on utilisation as a basis for predicting fuel consumption. This paper proposes an econometric method for identifying the influences on household vehicle use. It differs from previous empirical work in that vehicle kilometers, fuel cost per kilometer and vehicle fuel efficiency are endogenous, with utilisation of each vehicle endogeneously dependent on the utilisation of each and every household vehicle. The data are drawn from wave 1 of a four-wave panel of 1436 households in the Sydney metropolitan area. The empirical findings expose a set of influences on use hitherto not considered. The model specification provides an appropriate module for integration with household-based discrete choice models of vehicle choice. ...|$|E
40|$|In the UK, {{the length}} of a goods {{carrying}} vehicle is limited to a maximum of 16. 5 m for a standard articulated vehicle and 18. 75 m for a draw-bar combination. This research has investigated the environmental, economic and practical impacts of expanding the volumetric carry capacity by increasing maximum length of vehicles to 25. 25 m, while maintaining the maximum gross weight at the current UK limit of 44 tonne. The scope is limited to the consideration of 25. 25 m vehicle variants that are currently in use in the Netherlands. The investigation was based on a variety of techniques that included bench research and case study modelling. It concludes that, although the picture is complex {{and there are a number}} of operational issues to be addressed, the introduction of high-capacity vehicles (HCVs) to the UK would yield valuable environmental and financial benefits at vehicle and operator level, provided that <b>vehicle</b> <b>utilisation</b> levels do not deteriorate as compared with current fleet. At the national level, financial benefits would be partially offset by infrastructure costs and there is some risk of environmental benefits being partially eroded by modal shift – but on both measures a net benefit is highly likely to remain. In addition, provided that appropriate risk control measures are adopted, use of HCVs is highly unlikely to have an adverse impact on road safety...|$|E
40|$|It {{is almost}} a cliche {{to say that we}} live in a {{knowledge}} society and that knowledge is an important resource of firms in their production of goods and provision of services to their clients. However it is not so easy to find many examples showing the use of domain knowledge in financial companies. This paper reports the case of how a vehicle lease company in the Netherlands combines the use of domain knowledge and information technology into an expert system to automate the control of vehicle maintenance activity. The results benefit all parties concerned. The lease company can control the vehicle repair and maintenance works more efficiently. For the customers, it is higher rate of <b>vehicle</b> <b>utilisation,</b> greater safety and lower costs. The dealers who carry out the repairs and maintenance can do their work faster, and are paid immediately and automatically via the banks, resulting in lower administrative costs. The case story suggests that domain knowledge can be perceived as a corporate resource and its utilisation can produce values for the stakeholders. We propose that financial firms (1) see themselves as knowledge system, as a network of knowledge nodes serving their customers, (2) consider knowledge intensive firms as their role models. We draw on an idea of Friedrich Hayek who perceives the economic problem of society as afinancial firms; domain knowledge; information technology; value added services; efficiency; Hayek. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. Sugarcane hauliers in South Africa {{have high}} {{variations}} in vehicle payloads, which influence both transport economics and {{the legitimacy of}} their operations. Increasing economic pressure due to declining sugar prices and ever increasing fuel prices has invoked interest to improve <b>vehicle</b> <b>utilisation</b> and reduce costs, while complying with the local traffic legislation. On-board weighing technologies, such as on-board load cells, could assist operators to control their payloads more accurately and hence reduce the frequency of both over and under loaded consignments. In this study, an investigation is conducted to evaluate the feasibility of on-board weighing systems in the South African sugarcane transport industry. An overview of on-board weighing systems is presented. The overview gives insight into the technical composition of an on-board weighing system as well as presenting various benefits and drawbacks {{that are associated with}} an on-board weighing system. Earlier studies conducted on the use of on-board weighing systems are scrutinised and evaluated and it is concluded from these that <b>vehicle</b> <b>utilisation</b> could be improved, while concurrently reducing the overloading of vehicles. Field research was conducted to evaluate the accuracy and consistency of on-board weighing systems currently being utilised in the sugarcane transport industry as well as to determine the critical factors that influence the effectiveness of the system while assessing if overloading of vehicles was reduced when on-board weighing systems were employed. It was concluded that the systems evaluated were reasonably accurate with mean error being 0. 4 tons. The consistency of the systems was good with 75 % of all measurement being within 0. 5 tons of each other. The critical factors determining the effectiveness of the on-board weighing systems were established as being management of the system as well as cane variety and quality. Overloading was reduced by 9 % in one field evaluation and 5 % in another. Further reduction can be realised through tighter management of the on-board weighing systems. An economic evaluation of an on-board weighing system was performed using the capital budget method. This method was used to determine the pay off period required to realise the investment into an on-board weighing system for scenarios where the payload is increased by 2, 3 and 4 tons and transport lead distance is 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 km. The shortest pay off period occurred when the lead distance was 60 km and the time was 1, 2 and 3 years for payload increases of 2, 3 and 4 tons respectively. For lead distances of 40, 60 and 80 km the investment is worthwhile and considerable returns in investment can be realised, however, for the other lead distances the pay off period could be deemed to be too long. From the observation made during the field evaluation together with the literature studied, guidelines for the use of on-board weighing systems under various transport scenarios were formulated and are presented in chapter six...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Growth in {{e-commerce}} has led {{to increasing}} use of light goods vehicles for parcel deliveries in urban areas. This paper provides an insight into the reasons behind this growth and the resulting effort required to meet the exacting delivery services offered by e-retailers which often lead to poor <b>vehicle</b> <b>utilisation</b> in the last-mile operation, {{as well as the}} duplication of delivery services in urban centres as competitors vie for business. A case study investigating current parcel delivery operations in central London identified the scale of the challenge facing the last-mile parcel delivery driver, highlighting the importance of walking which can account for 62 % of the total vehicle round time and 40 % of the total round distance in the operations studied. The characteristics of these operations are in direct conflict with the urban infrastructure which is being increasingly redesigned in favour of walking, cycling and public transport, reducing the kerbside accessibility for last-mile operations. The paper highlights other pressures on last-mile operators associated with managing seasonal peaks in demand; reduced lead times between customers placing orders and deliveries being made; meeting delivery time windows; first-time delivery failure rates and the need to manage high levels of product returns. It concludes by describing a range of initiatives that retailers and parcel carriers, sometimes in conjunction with city authorities, can implement to reduce the costs associated with last-mile delivery, without negatively impacting on customer service levels...|$|E
40|$|Diesel {{particulate}} matter (DPM), in particular, has been likened {{in a somewhat}} inflammatory manner to be the ‘next asbestos’. From the business change perspective, there are three areas holding the industry back from fully engaging with the issue: 1. 	There is no real feedback loop in any operational sense {{to assess the impact}} of investment or application of controls to manage diesel emissions. 2. 	DPM are getting ever smaller and more numerous, but there is no practical way of measuring them to regulate them in the field. Mass, the current basis of regulation, is becoming less and less relevant. 3. 	Diesel emissions management is generally wholly viewed as a cost, yet there are significant areas of benefit available from good management. This paper discusses a feedback approach to address these three areas to move the industry forward. The six main areas of benefit from providing a feedback loop by continuously monitoring diesel emissions have been identified: 1. 	Condition-based maintenance. Emissions change instantaneously if engine condition changes. 2. 	Operator performance. An operator can use a lot more fuel for little incremental work output through poor technique or discipline. 3. 	<b>Vehicle</b> <b>utilisation.</b> Operating hours achieved and ratios of idling to under power affect the proportion of emissions produced with no economic value. 4. 	Fuel efficiency. This allows visibility into other contributing configuration and environmental factors for the vehicle. 5. 	Emission rates. This allows scope to directly address the required ratio of ventilation to diesel emissions. 6. 	Total carbon emissions - for NGER-type reporting requirements, calculating the emissions individually from each vehicle rather than just reporting on fuel delivered to a site...|$|E
40|$|The road based {{transportation}} {{operations are}} growing rapidly, {{but the current}} infrastructure cannot sustain the entire growth. At the same time <b>vehicle</b> <b>utilisation</b> and fill rates are low. Improved efficiency of the operations is a necessary way forward for road based transportation. Parallel to this, heavy vehicle producers are currently improving the efficiency with services accompanying the product that {{are focused on the}} driver and the vehicle performance. However, the data from connected vehicles required for these services only entail a small amount of the operational data generated by connected vehicles. The case study aims to answer how to use connected vehicle operational data in order to suggest value adding services in a dynamic road distribution system. The applied methodology is an inductive study with an explanatory approach to map the current and future service offerings of the case company. This knowledge is combined with an exploratory approach with interviews of transport planners and theories of Lean and fleet management. Primarily, it is concluded that the perspective of operational data requires widening. Considering not only driver and vehicle operations but rather the entire transport operation of a company. It is also concluded that value creation with operational data is possible during three phases of fleet management. First, if knowledge about order data is accessible, the planning of transportations can be improved using route optimisation and operations research. Secondly, it is possible to create value during the execution phase, throughless manual supervision and communication by transport planners. Lastly, both the currently used operational data and further data usage can contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the performance of a fleet operation and facilitate for continuous improvements during an evaluation phase...|$|E
40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of the study of}} the dimensions of automobile demand (1981 - 1988) is to obtain reliable forecasts of the variables which drive the fundamental energy equation: energy consumed (litres) = efficiency of technology (litres per 100 kilometres) x utilisation rate (kilometres per period). Since the level of utilisation is unlikely to be independent of the state of technology, and since both dimensions are conditioned by {{the state of the economy}} and the nature of households as well as by the extent of corporate-sector support to the household sector, it is necessary to view the levels of vehicle usage and vehicle fuel efficiency as outputs of the broader household decision process. This broader context can be represented by a study of the household's choice of automobiles (by number and composition) and level of utilisation. This perspective enables us to view vehicle efficiency and utilisation as derivatives of a study of the household's demand for mobility services, which is derived from the demand for end activities (consumption of goods and leisure). Since we are especially interested in the role of fuel prices and vehicle technology in the household's decision on the level of <b>vehicle</b> <b>utilisation,</b> it is desirable to monitor the response path of a sample of households over a period of time. A single cross-section approach cannot identify the influence of changing fuel prices on vehicle use, nor can it adequately accommodate the temporal relationship between vehicle purchase/disposal decision and the utilisation rate. To represent satisfactorily the role of policy variables (for example, fuel prices, taxes associated with vehicle possession, standards for vehicle technology) in the context of the wider set of influences on household automobile possession and usage, the study members have developed an econometric model system which jointly models the household's choice of vehicles and utilisation level over the period 1981 - 1985. This paper provides an overview of the theoretical, methodological, and empirical dimensions of the project and, where appropriate, introduces some preliminary findings. The project in its entirety is due for completion in late 1988. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Reducing {{environmental}} impact is increasingly important for companies and this includes concerns regarding emissions from purchased freight transport services. When shippers order freight transport services, according to purchasing agreements, shipment specific requirements are specified, which can restrict the planning options of the transport provider, thereby influencing how the transport is performed {{and the resulting}} environmental performance. Therefore, shippers’ daily processes for ordering freight transport are of interest. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore how the shipper´s freight transport ordering process influences the logistical variables in the framework of Piecyk and McKinnon (2010) : modal split, handling factor, average length of haul, lading factor, empty running, fuel efficiency and carbon intensity of fuel, in order to understand in what way CO 2 emissions can be affected by the freight transport ordering process. Research approach: An explorative multiple case study of routine freight transport ordering processes at manufacturing companies was carried out. Shippers were interviewed to describe the transport ordering process as well as how related internal processes provide input to the process. The analysis combines the information from the cases with literature that describes logistical variables, and results in a description of how the transport ordering process can influence logistical variables. Findings and Originality: The study identified several connections from the freight transport ordering process to logistical variables and that the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions partly depends on input from other processes. Examples of findings are, first, that timing of information input to the transport ordering process regarding transport requirements can influence lading factor and empty running, by affecting opportunities for the transport provider to plan <b>vehicle</b> <b>utilisation.</b> Secondly, communication between the sales staff and the transport ordering staff about customer needs regarding delivery times can affect urgency of transport and thereby influence modal split. Thirdly, information input to the transport ordering process regarding dimensions can affect planning of space required for the shipment and the utilisation of ordered space, thereby influencing lading factor. Research impact: The paper contributes by process descriptions of the freight transport ordering processes, which has been rarely covered in previous research. Also, a general model of the process is proposed. It also contributes to the framework used by Piecyk and McKinnon (2010) by showing influence from the transport ordering process on logistical variables. Practical impact: Shippers can learn how the configuration of the freight transport ordering process can influence logistical variables. This is important in order to be able to configure the freight transport ordering process to accommodate environmental considerations and reduce CO 2 emissions from freight transport...|$|E
40|$|Melbro Holdings (Pty) Ltd., a South African {{wholesale}} trading company, house distribution centres throughout South Africa. Deliveries {{are made}} from four distribution centres to respective customers throughout Southern Africa. The company consists of six divisions, two namely being; JMC and Heneck Sacks. In this paper, these two divisions are investigated {{in order to make}} strategic logistical improvements to better the current situation. Recent sales agreements have been lost which has decreased the volume of goods that Melbro consolidate and deliver to customers. The current process is manual and together with this decrease in sales, has resulted in a low <b>vehicle</b> <b>utilisation</b> and unnecessary costs. This therefore has a major effect on the deliveries but yet no correction or investigation has been made. This document identifies how the typical vehicle routing problem together with shipment consolidation will be solved. As a first phase of the project, the problem aim and scope were identified to clarify the expectations and activities that need to be met. Hence, the key outcome of this project was identified as developing a generic tool for the company to determine the optimal consolidation and routing scheme for shipments. The second phase of this document includes literature review on three parts, namely; the Clustering Problem, Assignment Problem and the Vehicle Routing Problem. Typical industry applications of these combined problems were also discussed. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to determine which software should be selected for the purpose of the tool. The AHP solution showed that MS Excel was the best possible option. The third phase of this document, explicitly defines how the model concept was developed from a “Systems perspective” as well as a functional perspective. The consolidation and routing tool was broken down into four particular parts: Data, Clustering, Assignment and Routing. Required information, mathematical models are outlined for Part 2, 3 and 4 of the model. Integration of the iii four parts is illustrated by means of inputs and outputs into each part of the model. A complete analysis on the flow of the system is also shown by using a Basic Flow Diagram. In the fourth phase, the physical model is discussed. A systematic approach was taken by using the principles of the model. Each MS Excel model tab is defined and clearly discussed with relation to the four parts already mentioned. The fifth phase discusses the results with relation to validation and testing, the case study comparison and implementation benefits that may be gained by use of the model. Finally, the last phase of this report, expresses the future recommendations that should be considered when implementing and working with this model on a daily basis. Thesis (B Eng.
