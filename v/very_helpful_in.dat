Though the National Cadet Corps had been already formed in 1948, it was Cariappa who extended support during its formative years.

25|$|The {{relation}} of concepts and cases in Rabinow’s work distinguishes {{itself from the}} more common mode of social science work predicated on using examples to test general theories or philosophical practice that seeks analytic clarity about universals or general (often highly abstract) cases. In contrast, Rabinow argues that work on concepts opens up and orients inquiry into the concrete features of distinctive cases, whereas the use of ostensibly timeless theory or universal concepts {{are unlikely to be}} <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> drawing attention to particularities and singularities. Given this goal, such traditional approaches can function as a real impediment to inquiry. Rabinow defines concept work as “constructing, elaborating and testing a conceptual inventory as well as specifying and experimenting with multi-dimensional diagnostic and analytic frames.” In that sense, Rabinow’s work continues with appropriate modifications a social scientific tradition stretching from Max Weber through Clifford Geertz.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the postsecondary planning of African American and Hispanic high school seniors in five large urban school districts. Just prior to graduation in 2001, students from 23 high schools completed surveys and focus groups about their college planning. Students' educational expectations were high. Nearly all expected to earn at least a bachelor's degree, and most expected to earn graduate or professional degrees. Over 80 percent had been accepted to college, and 90 percent viewed college as an important means to future jobs and career goals. Maternal influence was a significant factor for most students. Nearly three-quarters reported that friends and peers were <b>very</b> or somewhat <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> college planning. For those with a father or male guardian present, 43 percent considered him <b>very</b> <b>helpful,</b> and 19 percent considered him somewhat helpful.

The eastern {{bank of the river}} houses the old city, which includes the central town of Bhadra. This part of Ahmedabad is characterised by packed bazaars, the pol system of closely clustered buildings, and numerous places of worship. A Pol (pronounced as pole) is a housing cluster which comprises many families of a particular group, linked by caste, profession, or religion. This is a list of Pols in the old walled city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat, India. Heritage of these Pols [...] has helped Ahmedabad gain a place in UNESCO's Tentative Lists, in selection criteria II, III and IV.

2500|$|One {{reason that}} {{psychedelic}} therapy was eventually restricted was {{concern about the}} use of drugs by the general public. In the mid-1960s, in response to concerns regarding the proliferation of the unauthorized use of psychedelic drugs by the general public (especially the counterculture), various steps were taken to curtail their use. Bowing to governmental concerns, Sandoz halted production of LSD in 1965, and in many countries LSD was banned, or made available on a very limited basis that made research difficult. Gradually, increasing restrictions were placed on medical and psychiatric research conducted with LSD and other psychedelic substances. In a congressional hearing in 1966, Senator Robert Kennedy questioned the shift of opinion with regards to this potentially rewarding form of treatment, noting that, [...] "Perhaps to some extent we have lost {{sight of the fact that}} (LSD) can be very, <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> our society if used properly." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Primary Chronicle, in 862, the Finnic and Slavic {{tribes in}} the area of Novgorod rebelled against their Varangian rulers, driving them {{overseas}} back to Scandinavia, but they soon started to conflict with each other. The disorder prompted the tribes to invite the Varangians back [...] "to come and rule them" [...] and bring peace to the region. Led by Rurik and his brothers Truvor and Sineus, the invited Varangians (called Rus') settled around the town of Holmgård (Novgorod). The Primary Chronicle twice names Rus' among the other Varangian peoples, including Swedes, Gutes, [...] "Normans", and [...] "Angles" [...] (Normans was an Old Slavonic term for Norwegians not the Normans, while Angles may be interpreted as Danes, not Anglo-Saxons). In some places, the chronicle mentions Slavs and Rus' as different groups, while in other instances it mixes them. In the study of the etymology of the word Rus itself several possible origins are identified, but none are conclusive or <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> defining the Rus' people themselves.|$|E
