5|$|A 1999 DEIS only {{proposed}} new subway service from 63rd Street north up Second Avenue to 125th Street <b>via</b> the Broadway Line to Lower Manhattan, with local and express tracks being {{switched on the}} Broadway Line. Second Avenue express trains would run to Lower Manhattan <b>via</b> the Montague Street Tunnel and local trains would run <b>via</b> the Manhattan Bridge and skip Lower Manhattan. A spur to Grand Central Terminal was considered, but later dropped due to its infeasibility.|$|E
5|$|A cheap, {{cost-effective}} {{and practical}} alternative in poorer countries is visual inspection with acetic acid (<b>VIA).</b> Instituting and sustaining cytology-based programs {{in these regions}} can be difficult, due {{to the need for}} trained personnel, equipment and facilities and difficulties in follow-up. With <b>VIA,</b> results and treatment can be available on the same day. As a screening test, <b>VIA</b> is comparable to cervical cytology in accurately identifying precancerous lesions.|$|E

5|$|A four-track Second Avenue Subway would {{originate}} from {{a connection to}} the IRT Pelham Line at 138th Street, the Bronx, to Grand Street, Manhattan. The connection to the Pelham Line would allow for eight additional trains per hour operating between Manhattan and the Pelham Line. It would then be possible to operate 10-car trains <b>via</b> the line and it would also be possible to operate full express service <b>via</b> the line's center express track. The trains operating <b>via</b> Nassau Street would go to Brooklyn <b>via</b> the Montague Tunnel. During non-rush hours trains would terminate at Broad Street. There would be a passageway built from Grand Central <b>via</b> 43rd Street to Second Avenue to permit transfers.|$|E

5|$|An {{extension}} {{of a proposed}} Madison Avenue Line and the IND Sixth Avenue Line operating <b>via</b> 59th Street, with two branches. One branch would have operated along Second Avenue with a branch connecting to the IRT Pelham Line, which {{would have had to}} be modified to fit B Division subway cars, and a branch connecting to the IND Concourse Line. The other branch would have continued under the East River, and would have been connected to the Long Island Rail Road main line in the Sunnyside area. Subway trains would have continued <b>via</b> the Port Washington Branch to Little Neck, and <b>via</b> the LIRR Main Line to Rego Park, where it would have turned <b>via</b> the former Rockaway Beach Branch and then would have turned onto the Lower Montauk Branch, and would have continued on the branch through Jamaica, where it would continue <b>via</b> the Atlantic Branch until Rosedale, staying within city limits. The report claims that its proposed routes would serve up to twice as many people as the NYCTA's proposed routes.|$|E
5|$|As {{originally}} {{proposed in}} 1925, the line's junction with the IND Crosstown Line in Long Island City {{would have been}} a T-junction, allowing trains from Manhattan to travel south to Brooklyn <b>via</b> the Crosstown line. A map from June of that year shows a proposed alternate routing for the Queens Boulevard Line, that would have had the line turn <b>via</b> Kew Gardens Road after the Union Turnpike station instead of continuing <b>via</b> Queens Boulevard. After proceeding <b>via</b> Kew Gardens Road the line would have turned <b>via</b> Hillside Avenue. The map also shows a two-track line continuing from the Van Wyck Boulevard station to 94th Avenue (Atlantic Avenue) in Richmond Hill <b>via</b> Van Wyck Boulevard (today's Van Wyck Expressway). During construction only bellmouths were built for the line, however they were eventually used for the IND Archer Avenue Line. As documented by the map, the Queens Boulevard Line, as originally planned, would have had the express trains travel on a more direct route, <b>via</b> Broadway and Queens Boulevard, while the local trains would take a less direct route hitting larger population centers. There were to be two such instances, however only one was actually completed. The first one, which was not constructed, would have gone through Winfield (now Woodside), west of the existing Elmhurst Avenue station, and the local tracks would have diverged, continuing <b>via</b> Queens Broadway before turning onto 69th Street (Fisk Avenue), rejoining the express tracks at Broadway in Woodside. The second instance, the one that was built, was planned to have the local tracks continue <b>via</b> Broadway west of the 65th Street station, and then it would turn south <b>via</b> Steinway Street before rejoining the express tracks at the 36th Street station. The express tracks here would take the more direct route, <b>via</b> Northern Boulevard.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to identify the prevalence and distribution of vitreoretinal interface abnormalities (<b>VIAs)</b> among urban community population in Shenyang, China. According to the WHO criteria, a cross-sectional study was carried out among 304 Type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) patients and 304 people without diabetes as control over 45 years old. The presence of <b>VIAs</b> was determined by standardized grading of macular optical coherence tomography (Optovue OCT; Optovue, Inc., Fremont, CA) scans and two-field fundus photographs in at least one eye. For both men and women, high prevalence of <b>VIAs</b> (70. 79 %) was observed among over 65 -years-old T 2 D patients. Prevalence of <b>VIAs</b> was observed to be high among T 2 D patients in all age groups compared to normal subjects. Prevalence of <b>VIAs</b> increased with age in all subjects. Prevalence of components of <b>VIAs</b> was epiretinal membrane (ERM) 11. 43 %, posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) 17. 76 %, vitreomacular traction syndrome (VMT) 5. 67 %, macular cysts/macular edema (MC/ME) 4. 61 %, full-thickness macular hole (FTMH) 0. 82 %, and partial thickness macular hole (PTMH) 0. 74 % in any eye, respectively. ERM and MC/ME were more prevalent in T 2 D in both males and females. The results highlight the need for early detection using OCT and approaches for the prevention of <b>VIAs</b> of diabetes in urban community...|$|R

40|$|The {{background}} {{of this paper}} is the fabrication of Through Silicon <b>Vias</b> (TSV) for three-dimensional chip stacking. At first an adapted etching process is presented. <b>Vias</b> with a cross sectional area of approx. 3 x 10 square micron and 50 - 70 micron depth were etched. Those <b>vias</b> have a V-shaped entrance that is aimed to prevent a pinch-off at the via-top and a void formation during the subsequent filling process. For a better filling performance a pre-treatment of the <b>vias</b> is necessary, too. Therefore the wetting behavior of Cu-CVD and Cu-PVD layers as well as Au-PVD layers that have undergone several pre-treatments was investigated by contact angle measurements. Moreover two plating chemistries were investigated regarding their impact on the wetting. Copper electro deposition experiments have been performed using DC and Pulse-Reverse (PR) currents and two commercially available electrolyte systems. In this experiment the beneficial effect of the V-shaped <b>vias</b> could be shown as well as the impact of several pre-treatments...|$|R

The options were extensions to Hayes <b>via</b> Peckham Rye, Beckenham Junction <b>via</b> Camberwell, or Hayes <b>via</b> New Cross. In July 2011, Network Rail recommended {{an extension of}} the Bakerloo line from Elephant & Castle to Lewisham, where it would take over the line to Hayes. In September 2014, Transport for London ran a consultation on the Bakerloo extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction with options <b>via</b> Lewisham and Camberwell or Old Kent Road, taking over Network Rail's Hayes line. The cost of the extension is estimated at around £2–3 billion with construction expected to take place between the mid-2020s and early 2030s.
