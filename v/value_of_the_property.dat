5|$|Castle House in {{the outer}} bailey was leased to the diplomat Sir Alexander Stephen in 1901, who carried out {{extensive}} work on the property in 1904, extending and modernising {{the north end of}} the house, including constructing a billiard room and a library; he estimated the cost of the work to be around £800. Castle House continued to be leased out by the Powis estate to wealthy individuals up until the Second World War. One such lessee, Richard Henderson observed that he had spent around £4,000 maintaining and upgrading the property, and the rentable <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>property</b> rose from £76 to £150 over the period.|$|E
5|$|This section covers {{compliance}} with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA). This act provides for uniform and equitable treatment of persons displaced by a federal programs from their homes, businesses, or farms, including assuring just compensation and assisting in relocation. For example, if {{the construction of a}} highway under a federal program requires the expropriation of homes, the expropriation must be made by either providing fair compensation for that property or providing assistance for, or reimbursement of, relocation expenses incurred by the affected person. The Compliance Supplement suggests verifying that the property acquired is appraised by qualified independent appraisers, the appraisals are examined by a review appraiser to assure acceptability, and that after acceptance, the review appraiser certifies the recommended or approved <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>property</b> for just compensation to the owner.|$|E

It would be a rare case in which the salvage award would be greater than 50 percent of the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>property</b> salvaged.

40|$|Abstract. A {{method for}} extracting new {{implicit}} knowledge from ontologies {{by using an}} inductive/deductive approach is presented. The new extracted knowledge takes <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> If-Then rules annotated with a weight. Such rules, termed Influence Rules, specify how <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> bound to a collection of concepts may influence <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> another concept. <b>The</b> technique, that combines data mining and link analysis, is completely general and applicable to whatever domain. The paper reports the methods and the algorithms supporting <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> mining <b>the</b> rules out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ontology, and discusses its application to real data from the economic field. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{remaining}} {{three types of}} layers [...] - [...] i18n layers, theme layers and user layers [...] - [...] are all subordinate to a specific layout layer. In general, {{all three of them}} can override both properties and functions/methods from the layout layer, but their intended purpose varies. i18n are provided to internationalise the layout; this is to allow the layout to be used by speakers of other languages, but not primarily to provide a way to customise the user-visible text. theme layers can be used to provide suggested sets <b>of</b> <b>values</b> for <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> a layout. A common application of this is to create aesthetically consistent colour themes, but in principle non-colour properties (fonts, sizes, etc.) can also be overridden in a theme layer. user layers, finally, are meant to store a particular user's preferences with regard to <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>properties.</b> <b>The</b> user layer ultimately has the [...] "final say" [...] on <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>properties.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Reform Act {{replaced}} the scot and lot franchise with an occupation franchise, which slightly reduced {{the size of}} the electorate.

25|$|The {{property}} may be reassessed {{under certain}} conditions other than a change of ownership, such as when additions or new construction occur. The assessed value is also subject to reduction if the market <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>property</b> declines below its assessed value, for example, during a real estate slump. Reductions of property valuation were not provided for by Proposition 13 itself, but were {{made possible by the}} passage of Proposition 8 (SCA No. 67) during 1978 that amended Proposition 13. Such a real estate slump and downward reassessments occurred during 2009 when the California State Board of Equalization announced an estimated reduction of property tax base year values due to negative inflation. The property tax in California is an Ad valorem tax meaning that the tax assessed (generally) increases and decreases with the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>property.</b>|$|E

25|$|Since then {{alterations}} to {{the structure}} have been minimal and mostly due to new regulations by the Department of Health or to serve the community better.
