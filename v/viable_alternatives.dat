25|$|When {{it became}} clear that Mexico would not stand for this kind of an agreement, some critics from the labor {{movement}} would not settle for any <b>viable</b> <b>alternatives.</b> In response, part of the labor movement wanted to declare their open opposition to the agreement, and to push for NAFTA's rejection in Congress. Ultimately, the ambivalence of labor groups led those within the Administration who supported NAFTA to believe that strengthening NAFTA's labor side agreement too much would cost more votes among Republicans than it would garner among Democrats, and would make it harder for the United States to elicit support from Mexico.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, the United States Department of State {{noted that}} {{although}} the ISA had not been used against the Singapore Government's political opponents for some years, [...] "political opposition and criticism remained restricted by the government's authority to define these powers broadly. In the past, occasional government references to speech that it considered 'out-of-bounds' were understood to be implicit threats to invoke the ISA." [...] The Singapore Government itself has regularly raised the need to prevent national security threats from materializing as a justification for preventive detention. However, there have been suggestions that the criminal law is apt for dealing with this matter as well. Crimes of accessory liability such as , conspiracy and unlawful assembly in the Penal Code may apply even if harm has not actualized. Furthermore, restrictions imposed by the Societies Act, {{as well as the}} offences in the Sedition Act, may be <b>viable</b> <b>alternatives</b> to preventive detention.|$|E

2500|$|However, Hawking later {{changed his}} mind and stated, [...] "M-theory is the only {{candidate}} for a complete theory of the universe."
