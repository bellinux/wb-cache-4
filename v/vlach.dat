5|$|Nosek's other friend Ondřej <b>Vlach</b> {{testified that}} Nosek's fall {{happened}} in a break {{between the end of}} concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to <b>Vlach,</b> there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. <b>Vlach</b> further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle. Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge {{at the back of his}} head, they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion. <b>Vlach</b> said that he understood Blythe's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{founding}} of Moldavia {{began with the}} arrival of a <b>Vlach</b> (Romanian) voivode (military leader), Dragoș, soon followed by his people from Maramureș to the region of the Moldova River. Dragoș established a polity there as a vassal to the Kingdom of Hungary in the 1350s. The independence of the Principality of Moldavia was gained when Bogdan I, another <b>Vlach</b> voivode from Maramureş who had fallen out with the Hungarian king, crossed the Carpathians in 1359 and took control of Moldavia, wresting the region from Hungary. It remained a principality until 1859, when it united with Wallachia, initiating the development of the modern Romanian state.|$|E
5|$|A lesser nobleman, Antal Nagy de Buda, {{came with}} a group of peasants from Diós and Burjánosóbuda (Deușu and Vechea) to the mountain. The <b>Vlach</b> Mihai arrived with people from Virágosberek (Florești). Salt miners from Szék (Sic) and poor townspeople from Kolozsvár joined the peasantry. About 56,000 armed men {{gathered}} on the plateau by the end of June, according to historian Lajos Demény's estimation.|$|E
5000|$|Despite their {{recognition}} as a separate ethnic group by the Serbian government, <b>Vlachs</b> are cognate to Romanians in the cultural and linguistic sense. Some Romanians, as well as international linguists and anthropologists, consider Serbia's <b>Vlachs</b> to be a subgroup of Romanians. Additionally, the Movement of Romanians-Vlachs in Serbia, which represents some <b>Vlachs,</b> has called for {{the recognition of the}} <b>Vlachs</b> as a Romanian national minority, giving them rights {{similar to those of the}} Romanians of Vojvodina. However, the results of the last census showed that most <b>Vlachs</b> of Eastern Serbia opted for the Serbian exonym vlasi (= <b>Vlachs)</b> rather than rumuni (= Romanians). As a result of serbianization, most <b>Vlachs</b> declared themselves to be [...] "Serbs" [...] on censusus taken by Communist Yugoslavia, but the number of those who preferred to declare themselves as <b>Vlachs</b> or Romanians significantly increased from 1991 (16,539 declared vlasi and 42 declared rumuni) to 2001 (39,953 declared vlasi and 4,157 declared rumuni).|$|R
50|$|In 1917, {{during the}} {{occupation}} of the territories of Albania and Northern Epirus, the Italians tried {{to win over the}} <b>Vlachs</b> to convert Vlach-Romanian relations in favor of Italy, based on historical and linguistic relations and to change the Romanian-lean <b>Vlachs</b> ("Ρουμανίζοντες Βλάχοι") into Italian-leaning <b>Vlachs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The pope next letter, {{which was}} written on 14 November 1234, {{revealed}} that there were [...] "certain people within the Cuman bishopric named Walati", or <b>Vlachs.</b> The <b>Vlachs</b> did not receive the sacraments from the Catholic bishop, but [...] "from some pseudo-bishops of the Greek rite". The pope also complained that the <b>Vlachs</b> even persuaded the [...] "Hungarians, Saxons and other Catholics" [...] who had settled in Cumania to join the Orthodox faith. Gregory IX authorized Bishop Theodoric to consencrate a Catholic bishop for the <b>Vlachs</b> and asked Duke Béla to assist Bishop Theodoric to impose his authority over the <b>Vlachs.</b> The pope's letter suggests that the <b>Vlachs</b> formed a significant, possibly the majority, group among the peoples of Cumania and {{they had their own}} local church hierarchy.|$|R
5|$|The Romanians' ethnogenesis {{cannot be}} {{understood}} based exclusively on written sources, because the earliest records on their ancestors {{were made by}} 11th-century Byzantine historians. When referring to the Romance-speaking population of Southeastern Europe, early medieval sources used the <b>Vlach</b> exonym or its cognates, which all derived from the Common Slavic term for speakers of the Latin language. The earliest sources write of the Vlachs of the central territories of the Balkan Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The monarchy {{was also}} dynastic: the princes {{were to be}} elected by boyars from {{among the members of}} the ruling family, the Basarabs. The boyars were the members of the privileged landed aristocracy. However, the origin of the Romanian boyar class is problematic: it may have evolved {{naturally}} from the heads of the <b>Vlach</b> villages and communities, but {{it is also possible that}} the princes created it by granting privileges to certain favored persons.|$|E
5|$|In 1194, Béla {{appointed}} {{his eldest}} son, Emeric, {{who had already}} been crowned as the future king, to administer Croatia and Dalmatia. After a united Bulgarian, Cumanian and <b>Vlach</b> army defeated the Byzantines in the Battle of Arcadiopolis in 1194, Béla was willing to assist the Byzantine Empire. However, his campaign was cancelled, because Béla's son-in-law, Emperor Isaac II, was dethroned by Alexios III Angelos in April 1195. Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, was planning to launch a campaign against the Byzantine Empire {{on behalf of the}} dethroned emperor, but Béla prohibited his subjects from joining Henry.|$|E
50|$|In the Ban's Croatia <b>Vlachs</b> mostly {{settled in}} the 17th century. In 1680 around 120 {{families}} were settled. In 1688 <b>Vlachs</b> settled in Bović, Kirin, and Gradišće. In 1718, noblewoman Marija Magdalena Drašković settled some <b>Vlachs</b> on her estate between the Tršca stream and village of Utinja. In 1750, an Orthodox priest and witnesses confirmed <b>Vlachs</b> didn't exist before around Kupa, Steničnjak, Petrova Gora and Slavsko Polje, but only around Hrvatska Kostajnica. They numbered around 4000 people.|$|R
5000|$|Orthodox <b>Vlachs</b> {{were also}} {{directed}} {{to settle in}} Lika when Arnaud Memi-Bey became commander of Lika Sanjak. The Beylerbey of Bosnia, Hasan-Pasha Predojević, himself an Islamized Orthodox [...] "Vlach" [...] from Herzegovina, received the support of these Orthodox <b>Vlachs</b> and many served in his armies. At Predojević's order, <b>Vlachs,</b> {{as well as some}} Turkish nobility, settled near the towns Brekovica, Ripča, Ostrvice and Vrla Draga near Sokolac in such numbers that they formed a significant population of this region. In 1579, <b>Vlachs</b> in Turkish service wanted to transfer the towns of Cazin and Ostrožac to Christian, that is Croatian, ownership. In 1599, many <b>Vlachs</b> emigrated from Korenica and Bihać area to Gomirje.|$|R
50|$|The Megleno-Romanians (Meglenoromâni), Moglenite <b>Vlachs</b> (Βλαχομογλενίτες, Vlachomoglenítes) {{or simply}} Meglenites (Megleniţi) or <b>Vlachs</b> (Megleno-Romanian: Vlași; Vlaşi, Власи) {{are a small}} Eastern Romance people, {{originally}} inhabiting seven villages in the Moglena region spanning the Pella and Kilkis regional units of Central Macedonia, Greece, and one village, Huma, {{across the border in}} the Republic of Macedonia. This people lives in an area of approximately 300 km2 in size. Unlike the Aromanian <b>Vlachs,</b> the other Romance speaking population in the same historic region, the Meglen <b>Vlachs</b> are traditionally sedentary agriculturalists, and not traditionally transhumants.|$|R
5|$|Albert of Habsburg (who was Sigismund of Luxembourg's {{son-in-law}} and successor) wrote {{a letter}} to Vlad, ordering him to protect Transylvania. Ignoring the king's command, Vlad joined Murad II who came to Wallachia at the head of his army in summer 1438, serving the sultan as his guide. The Ottoman and Wallachian troops broke into Hungary at Orșova. They routed the army of a local <b>Vlach</b> kenez, Cândea, near Hațeg. They marched along the river Mureș, capturing Câlnic and Sebeș. At Sebeș, Vlad convinced the leaders of the town to give in without resistance, promising to protect their property if they accompanied him to Wallachia. The Ottomans and Wallachians laid siege to Sibiu, but the siege lasted only for 8 days. They destroyed the outskirts of Brașov, before they left Hungary loaded with plunder and taking more than 30,000 captives.|$|E
5|$|Romanian chronicles {{written in}} the 17th century narrate that a herțeg or duke of Făgăraș and Almaș, named Radu Negru (‘Radu the Black’) or Negru Vodă (‘The Black Voivode’) was the first voivode of Wallachia. These texts state that Radu Negru, {{together}} with some colonists ("Romanians, Catholics and Saxons") arrived from the region of Făgăraş in Transylvania. The first documentary evidence for a terra Blacorum (‘land of the Vlachs’) on the territory later called Făgăraș is an early 13th-century property register which mentions the order of King Andrew II of Hungary that estates previously in <b>Vlach</b> hands {{be transferred to the}} Cistercian abbey at Cârța. Radu Negru and his followers crossed the Carpathians to Muntenia and founded Wallachia with its capitals in Câmpulung and Curtea de Argeș. The chronicles narrate these events under the year 1290 or 1292.|$|E
5|$|The Transylvanian peasants {{had already}} been outraged because of the {{increase}} of existing seigneurial duties and taxes {{and the introduction of}} new taxes during {{the first decades of the}} century. The bishop also tried to collect the tithe from the petty noblemen and from Orthodox Vlachs who had settled in parcels abandoned by Catholic peasants. In the spring of 1437, Hungarian and <b>Vlach</b> commoners, poor townspeople from Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) and petty noblemen started to assemble on the flat summit of Mount Bábolna near Alparét (Bobâlna) where they set up a fortified camp. The bishop and his brother, Roland Lépes, the deputy of the voivode (or royal governor) of Transylvania, gathered their troops to fight against the rebels. The voivode, the two counts of the Székelys and many Transylvanian noblemen also hurried to the mountain to assist them against the rebels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vlachs</b> surnamed Vlahović, Žurović, and Predojević, those {{belonging}} to the Pribač Nikolić pasture encampment, {{and some of the}} Banjan and Maleševac <b>Vlachs</b> (surnamed Hrebeljanović, Milićiević and Milošević) were Pavlovlić vassals.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vlachs</b> (власи/vlasi, autonymed Rumâni; români, rumâni), are a {{community}} {{concentrated in the}} Vidin Province in the northwestern part of Bulgaria. Most of this people declare themselves vlasi (<b>Vlachs)</b> when asked in Bulgarian (e.g. on the census). The <b>Vlachs</b> in Bulgaria are not recognized as a national minority, and as an ethnic group and they don't have ethnic rights in schools or churches since the Interwar period.|$|R
5000|$|In 1382, Vukoslav Piščić {{was named}} as knez of all <b>Vlachs</b> by king Tvrtko I of Bosnia. The {{earliest}} noble landowners {{they were assigned}} to in Herzegovina was the Sanković noble family, with katun Tomić. In 1409, when Tvrtko I conquered parts of Rascia and Zeta there were located around 100 katuns. They were mentioned as [...] "Vlachorum congregationes et cetus". In the area around Stolac and Zabljak were so many <b>Vlachs</b> {{that in the end}} of the 15th century the territory was as Donji Vlasi (Lower <b>Vlachs).</b> The Gornji Vlasi (Upper <b>Vlachs)</b> were only mentioned by Mavro Orbini.|$|R
5|$|The Hungarian {{conquest of}} the Carpathian Basin is the {{principal}} subject of the Gesta Hungarorum, which is the earliest extant Hungarian chronicle. Most scholars agree that a notary of Béla III of Hungary, who ruled between 1173 and 1196, wrote the Gesta after the king's death. According to an alternative theory, {{the author of the}} Gesta, who is now known as Anonymus, had served Béla II of Hungary before starting to complete his work around 1150. Anonymus did not write of Svatopluk I of Moravia, Braslav, Duke of Lower Pannonia and the invading Magyars' other opponents who had been mentioned in works written in earlier centuries. Neither did he refer to the Magyars' fights with the Moravians, Franks and Bavarians which had been described in earlier annals and chronicles. On the other hand, Anonymus wrote of local polities and rulersincluding Gelou, the <b>Vlach</b> duke of Transylvania, Menumorut, the lord of the regions between the rivers Mureș, Someș and Tisza, and Salanus, the Bulgar ruler of the lands between the Danube and the Tiszaunknown from other primary sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{retreating}} Hungarian army, {{on its way}} to Transylvania, {{was stopped}} by a blockade; there they decided to bury the 500 cannons and other treasures, so the Moldavians {{would not be able to}} capture them. According to Długosz, Corvinus escaped the Moldavians due to the assistance of another <b>Vlach</b> (Romanian), whom Stephen found and had executed because of treachery. The Moldavian-German Chronicles say that someone named Isaia failed to launch the cavalry attack which would have blocked the path for the Hungarian retreat; for this, he and others were later executed. Around 10,000 Hungarians were said to have been killed; most of the barons escaped with their king. A Hungarian chronicle mentions 7,000 casualties for the Moldavians. This chronicle is disputed though, due to it being the only one mentioning the Moldavian casualties in numbers; and because the Hungarians did not have the opportunity to calculate the numbers of their fallen enemy. The entire conflict, with the Hungarian invasion and retreat, took around forty days.|$|E
25|$|These {{are family}} names {{that have been}} derived from either <b>Vlach</b> or Romanian. Most of these names have been given when a Romanian settled in a non-Romanian region. Examples: Oláh (37,147 Hungarians have this name), <b>Vlach,</b> Vlahuta, Vlasa, Vlasi, Vlašic, Vlasceanu, Vlachopoulos, Voloh, Volyh, Vlack, Flack and Vlax.|$|E
50|$|In Vojvodina, Romanian {{enjoys the}} status of {{official}} language and Romanians in this province receive {{a wide range of}} minority rights, including access to state-funded media and education in their native language. Most of the Romanians and <b>Vlachs</b> of Serbia are Eastern Orthodox by faith, belonging to the Romanian Orthodox Church (Romanians in Vojvodina) and Serbian Orthodox Church (<b>Vlachs</b> of Central Serbia). The relative isolation of the <b>Vlachs</b> has permitted the survival of various pre-Christian religious rites that are frowned upon by the Orthodox Church. Like the Serbs, <b>Vlachs</b> celebrate the 'slava', though its meaning is chtonic (related to the house and farmland) rather than familial.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Vlachs</b> {{in eastern}} Moravia rose {{up during the}} Thirty Years' War (1618-48). They fought {{successfully}} against Habsburg rule in 1620-23, and were initially supported by rebellious Protestant Hungarians. Having had all of Moravia east of the Morava river under their control by 1621, the <b>Vlachs</b> were defeated in 1623, after which a series of public executions took place. They renewed attacks in late 1623, and notably defeated a Polish contingent in March 1624. In 1625-30 Habsurg and Danish armies repeatedly crossed Moravia. The <b>Vlachs</b> joined the Danes, and later, the Swedes. After the Danish retreat in 1627, and Swedish retreat in 1643, the Habsburgs finally defeated the <b>Vlachs</b> in 1644.|$|R
2500|$|The Orthodox <b>Vlachs</b> {{were not}} {{required}} to pay the tithe which was payable by all Catholic peasants to the Church. In 1328, Pope John XXII stated that the obligatory payment of tithes {{was one of the main}} obstacles of the conversion of non-Catholics (including Cumans and <b>Vlachs)</b> in Hungary. The <b>Vlachs</b> paid a special in kind tax, the quinquagesima (or [...] "fiftieth") after their sheep, which shows that sheep-breeding was their principal economic.|$|R
25|$|Writers who {{reject the}} notion of supersessionism include Michael J. <b>Vlach,</b> Walter Brueggemann, Roland Edmund Murphy, Jacques B. Doukhan.|$|E
25|$|Nowadays, {{the term}} <b>Vlach</b> {{is more often}} {{used to refer to}} the Romanized populations of the Balkans who speak Daco-Romanian, Aromanian, Istro-Romanian and Megleno-Romanian.|$|E
25|$|The name Wallachia, {{generally}} not used by Romanians themselves (but present in some contexts as Valahia or Vlahia), {{is derived from}} the term walhaz used by Germanic peoples to describe Celts, and later romanized Celts and all Romance-speaking people. In Northwestern Europe this gave rise to Wales, Cornwall, Wallonia, among others, while in Southeast Europe it evolved into the ethnonym <b>Vlach,</b> used to designate Germanic speakers' Romance-speaking neighbours, and subsequently taken over by Slavic-speakers to refer to Romanians, with variants such as <b>Vlach,</b> Blach, Bloc, Bloh, Boloh etc.—see also Vlachs.|$|E
5000|$|The Rüsûm-i Eflakiye was {{a tax on}} <b>Vlachs</b> in the Ottoman Empire. <b>Vlachs</b> in the Balkans {{were granted}} tax {{concessions}} under Byzantine and Serb rulers in return for military service; and this continued under Ottoman rule. Instead {{of some of the}} customary taxes, they paid a special [...] "Vlach tax", Rüsûm-i Eflakiye: One sheep and one lamb from each household on St. Georges Day each year. Because <b>Vlachs</b> were taxed differently, they were listed differently in defters.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the arrival}} of Slavs, <b>Vlachs</b> began to {{assimilate}} with them, and being exposed to the Slavic language they gradually began to adopt it as their own. Raymond D'Aguilers and William of Tyre during {{the passage of the}} Crusaders in the 11th century pointed the difference between {{the people who live in}} hilly hinterland, speak Slavic and deal with grooming of the cattle, from those in the coast who still speak Latin language (probably extinct Dalmatian language) and have different customs. In documents from Lika (1433), Cetina (1436), and Zrmanja (1486-87), a century after their first mention in the historical documents, the <b>Vlachs</b> had mostly unchristian, traditional South Slavic names and surnames. Exactly because of that the <b>Vlachs</b> differed from the Croats (and some <b>Vlachs)</b> who usually had Christian names. The <b>Vlachs</b> were called as [...] "Vlasi na Hrvateh", [...] "good Vlachs" [...] (dobri Vlasi), [...] "good men from katuns" [...] (dobri muži katunari), or [...] "royal Vlachs" [...] (Olahi domini nostri regis, Wolachi banatus regni Croatie).|$|R
5000|$|On March 1, 1942, Diamandi {{issued an}} ample Manifesto which was {{published}} in the local press and republished by Stavros Anthemides in 1997 (in his book on the <b>Vlachs</b> of Greece; see bibliography). The Manifesto was co-signed by leading Aromanians (<b>Vlachs)</b> intellectuals such as: ...|$|R

25|$|Sima Ćirković (1964) and Marko Vego (1973) {{argued that}} the {{emergence}} of the stećci among Vlachs coincides with their social-economical rise, confirmed in region of Zachlumia where is located the most well known necropolis of Radimlja related to the Vlachian family Miloradović-Stjepanović from genus Hrabreni. Financial possibilities of ordering such expensive ways of burial among Vlachs are supported and confirmed in the historical documents, with an example of <b>Vlach</b> from Cetina, Ostoja Bogović, who in 1377 paid the cost of burial of <b>Vlach</b> Priboja Papalić for 40 libra. At the time burial in Split costed 4-8 libra, while for a sum of 40 libra could be bought family grave in the church of Franciscan order in Šibenik.|$|E
25|$|John Hunyadi and Nicholas Újlaki, {{who were}} also voivodes of Transylvania and counts of the Székelys, were jointly made the ispáns of Temes, Arad, Csanád, Keve and Krassó Counties in 1441, thus again uniting the {{administration}} of most Banat. Hunyadi granted nobility to at least five <b>Vlach</b> knezes in Temes County after the Diet of Hungary elected him governor of the kingdom in 1446. The new status of the local knezes did not influence {{the position of the}} <b>Vlach</b> commoners who lived in the knezes' estates, because they preserved their liberties, including their right to be judged by elected jurors. Ladislaus V of Hungary mortgaged the office of the ispán of Temes, along with all royal fortresses and domains attached to it, to Hunyadi in 1455.|$|E
50|$|The Sarakatsani {{themselves}} have always stressed their Greek identity and deny having any {{relationship with the}} <b>Vlachs.</b> The <b>Vlachs</b> also regard the Sarakatsani as a distinct ethnic group, calling them Graeci (i.e. Greeks), a name used by Aromanians to distinguish the Greek-speaking populations from themselves, the Armânji.|$|R
5000|$|The Romance-speaking {{community}} in Bulgaria (the vlasi) are roughly divided into the [...] "White Vlachs" [...] of Vidin and [...] "Kutzo-Vlachs" [...] of the Rhodopes.
