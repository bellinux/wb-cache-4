5|$|Cladistic {{analyses}} of tyrannosaurid phylogeny often find Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa, with Daspletosaurus more basal than either.

An alternative hypothesis was presented in a 2003 study by Phil Currie and colleagues, which found weak support for Daspletosaurus as a basal member of a clade also including Tarbosaurus and Alioramus, both from Asia, based on the absence of a bony prong connecting the nasal and lacrimal bones. Alioramus was found to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus in this study, based on a similar pattern of stress distribution in the skull.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Ignacio {{continued}} to quickly intensify after becoming a hurricane, and reached peak winds of 105mph (165km/h) later on August 24 while located within 30miles (48km/h) {{off the coast}} of Baja California Sur. Upon reaching peak strength, the hurricane possessed a 12mile (19km) wide eye surrounded by <b>very</b> <b>deep</b> convection. The National Hurricane Center predicted it to attain major hurricane status and potentially reach significantly higher winds if the center remained over open water. However, it turned to the northwest and paralleled the Baja California Peninsula a short distance offshore, resulting in a steady weakening trend due to its interaction with the high terrain. On August 25 Ignacio made landfall just east of La Paz with winds of 80mph (130km/h). It rapidly weakened over land, first deteriorating to a tropical storm 12hours after landfall and later to a tropical depression about a day after moving ashore. Ignacio continued northwestward across the peninsula, and dissipated on August 28 while located in northwestern Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lane {{continued}} to organize with its 9mile (14km) wide eye surrounded by <b>very</b> <b>deep</b> convection, and the storm strengthened further to reach peak winds of 125mph (205km/h) by midday on September 16. It turned unexpectedly {{to the northeast}} , and at 1915UTC on the 16th, Hurricane Lane made landfall in a sparsely populated region of Sinaloa, 20miles (32km) southeast of El Dorado. This made Lane the most intense hurricane to strike Mexico since Hurricane Kenna in the 2002 season. The combination of the mountainous terrain of Mexico and increasing west-southwesterly wind shear caused the storm to rapidly weaken, and the storm dissipated on September 17. The remnants of Lane later moved into Texas, United States.|$|E
5|$|It {{continued}} to organize {{throughout the day}} on June21, developing banding features and increased convection. Several hours after being classified a depression, the system intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it received the name Andres. Upon being named, Andres marked latest date that the first named storm of a season developed since 1969 when Tropical Storm Ava developed on July1 of that year. By the morning of June22, <b>very</b> <b>deep</b> thunderstorm activity existed near the center, and the overall convective pattern had become more symmetric in nature. Favorable conditions, warm sea surface temperatures, allowed Andres to gradually intensify as it tracked near the Mexican coastline. However, strong wind shear, a factor that generally weakens tropical cyclones, {{had little effect on}} the developing storm.|$|E

5|$|PÃ©ron {{stated that}} the nest was usually {{situated}} near water {{and on the ground}} under the shade of a bush. It was constructed of sticks and lined with dead leaves and moss; it was oval in shape and not <b>very</b> <b>deep.</b> He claimed that seven to nine eggs were laid always on 25 and 26 July, but the selective advantage of this breeding synchronisation is unknown. The female incubated the eggs, but the male apparently developed a brood patch, which indicates it contributed as well. The non-incubating parent also stayed by the nest, and the chicks left the nest two to three days after hatching. The eggs were preyed upon by snakes, rats, and quolls. PÃ©ron gave the incubation period as five or six weeks, but since the mainland emu incubates for 50 to 56 days, this may be too short. He stated a mother emu would defend its young from crows with its beak, but this is now known to be strictly male behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} initially tracked slowly north-northwestward {{and gradually}} strengthened. Late on September 1 it intensified into Tropical Storm Isis while located about 200miles (320km) south of Cabo San Lucas. Upon becoming a tropical storm, the deep convection was not organized, causing one forecaster to describe Isis {{as a large}} monsoon-like system. A mid-level trough extending southward from the Arizona/California border caused the storm to accelerate northward. The storm quickly strengthened; six hours after Isis became a tropical storm it reached winds of 70mph (115km/h). <b>Very</b> <b>deep,</b> symmetrical convection developed over the poorly defined center of circulation while banding features began to form, although ill-defined outflow and land interaction with the Baja California Peninsula initially prevented further strengthening. At 1200UTC on September 2, Isis made landfall on extreme southeastern Baja California Sur as a strong tropical storm, and subsequently turned to the north-northeast.|$|E
5|$|Vigorous {{degassing}} {{of carbon}} dioxide occurs from several vents in two bogs near Nazko Cone. These vents are {{in the form of}} small isolated travertine mounds on the bog surface. A mound with a partially submerged vent had been identified in 2013 with a steady flow {{of carbon dioxide}}. Several new vents with no travertine mound were actively releasing carbon dioxide gas in 2015. Analysis of the carbon-13 isotope in the carbon dioxide gas emissions suggest a magmatic origin. This has led to the possibility of a volcanic geothermal system, the existence of which has been investigated by Geoscience BC as part of their Targeting Resources for Exploration and Knowledge project. The lack of hot springs and geothermal evidence on the surface suggest that the heat source of such a system would be <b>very</b> <b>deep</b> underground.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} skull, the {{skeleton}} of Istiodactylus was {{similar to those of}} other ornithocheiroid pterosaurs. The vertebral column, forelimb, and trunk bones were pneumatised by air sacs. The neural arches of the vertebrae had tall, sloping laminae. The notarium (a structure consisting of fused vertebrae in the shoulder-region of some pterosaurs and birds) consisted of six fused trunk vertebrae, with their neural spines fused into a plate, on which the shoulder blades articulated with a depression on each side. The main part of the sternum was <b>very</b> <b>deep,</b> with a bowed front edge and a shallow, triangular keel. The facets of the sternum that contacted with the coracoids were saddle-shaped and arranged asymmetrically. The humerus (upper arm bone) was stout and had a sharply curved deltopectoral crest. The forelimbs of istiodactylids were large, up to 4.5 times longer than their legs. The long wing-finger may have occupied 50 percent of the wing-skeleton. The hindlimbs were short compared to the forelimbs, and the feet were as long as the small third finger.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{depression}} possessed {{a combination of}} tropical and subtropical characteristics; it remained attached to a nearby frontal zone, though {{the organization of the}} convection and a warm core within the system resulted in classification as a tropical cyclone. Forecasters had predicted {{the depression}} would only slowly strengthen and reach a peak intensity of 65mph (105km/h). However, the depression steadily organized and had strengthened into Tropical Storm Juan by early September25. Juan moved northwestward at around 10mph (16km/h) in response to a developing subtropical ridge to its east. On September26, an eye feature developed, and <b>very</b> <b>deep</b> convection increased around the circulation. The cloud pattern continued to consolidate, and Juan attained hurricane status later on September26 while located 165mi (270km) southeast of Bermuda. The hurricane moved into an area of warm waters and light wind shear, allowing for additional strengthening; by September27, Juan had attained a peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h) while located 635mi (1,020km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. At this peak strength, the eye of the hurricane was distinct and embedded within a well-defined and round central dense overcast.|$|E
5|$|Located to the {{southeast}} of a broad and deep tropospheric trough and {{to the west of}} a low to mid-level ridge, Omar took a counter-clockwise turn on October14. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Omar began to undergo an extended period of rapid intensification as <b>very</b> <b>deep</b> convection developed around the center of circulation. Wind shear around the storm, which was previously inhibiting quick development, weakened, allowing for further strengthening. Later that day, an 11.5 to 17.2mi (18.5 to 27.7km) wide eye formed as the storm began to turn towards the northeast due to the trough. With the formation of an eye, the Dvorak technique rendered an intensity of 75mph (120km/h), signifying that Omar had intensified into a hurricane. The intensification briefly stalled as the eyewall eroded and the center of the storm became slightly elliptical. However, deep convection persisted and strengthening was forecast as the storm neared Puerto Rico. Shortly after, the eye quickly became well-defined and appeared on visible satellite images, an indication the storm was intensifying. The chances of rapid intensification were good as the storm featured well-developed outflow and prominent banding features.|$|E
