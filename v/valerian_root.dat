40|$|AbstractA {{mathematical}} model {{was developed to}} evaluate the performance of heat pump dryer for drying of aromatic plants. The model consists of three sub-models; namely, drying model, heat pump model, and performance model. Drying model was developed based on mass balance, heat balance, heat transfer and drying rate equations. Heat pump sub-model consists of some theoretical and empirical equations for estimating the parameters of evaporator, compressor, condenser and expansion valve. The performance sub-model was the equations for prediction of drying efficiency, COP (coefficient of performance), MER (moisture evaporating rate) and SMER (specific moisture evaporating rate). The model was validated with the experimental data. The experiments was conducted in a fixed bed drying of <b>valerian</b> <b>roots</b> (Valeriana officinalis L.) in cooperation with a agricultural company (Agrargenossenschaft Nöbdenitz e. G., Thüringen) in Thüringen, Germany. Data logger was used to record the temperature, relative humidity, humidity ratio and enthalpy of air at different positions of the dryer equipped with different types of sensors. The average drying air temperature was 36. 84 °C and relative humidity was about 20 %. About 89 hours were required to reduce the moisture content of <b>valerian</b> <b>roots</b> from 89 to 9 % (wb). The simulated results (temperature, relative humidity and moisture content) agreed well with the experimental results. The average COP, MER and SMER and drying efficiency were 5. 45, 140. 03 kg/h, 0. 038 kg/kWh, and 78. 23 %, respectively. This model {{may be used for}} design data for heat pump dryer for drying of aromatic plants as well as other heat sensitive crops...|$|R

25|$|Because of valerian's {{historical}} {{use as a}} sedative, antiseptic, anticonvulsant, migraine treatment, {{and pain}} reliever, most basic science research has been directed at the interaction of valerian constituents with the GABA receptor. Many studies remain inconclusive and all require clinical validation. The mechanism of action of valerian in general, and as a mild sedative in particular, has not been fully elucidated. However, some of the GABA-analogs, particularly valerenic acids as components of the essential oil along with other semivolatile sesquiterpenoids, generally {{are believed to have}} some affinity for the GABAA receptor, a class of receptors on which benzodiazepines are known to act. Valeric acid, which is responsible for the typical odor of mostly older <b>valerian</b> <b>roots,</b> does not have any sedative properties. Valeric acid is related to valproic acid, a widely prescribed anticonvulsant; valproic acid is a derivative of valeric acid.|$|R

40|$|Background: Valerian is a {{medicinal}} plant potential for insomnia. Active substance in <b>Valerian</b> <b>roots</b> such as valepotriates, volatile essential oil, and alkaloid metabolism primarily {{taken place in}} the liver, thus the chance of this organ getting damage is very high. The objective {{of this study was to}} know the effects of Valerian extract on liver microscopic appearance and SGOT level of wistar rat. Methode: This research was an experimental study using the Pre and Post Test Only Control Group Design for SGOT level and Post Test Only Control Group Design for microscopic appearance. the samples were 20 wistar rat, randomly divided into 4 groups. K was control group which was only given aquadest. P 1,P 2,P 3 were treatment groups which were given valerian exctract 9, 18 and 36 mg/kgBB for 3 months. At the end of 3 rd month the wistar rat were terminated to observed the microscopic appearance and SGOT level. The obtained data were analyzed using Oneway-Anova test followed by Post-Hoc test. Result: The scores are assessed include changes in parenchymatouse degeneration, hydropic degeneration, and necrosis.

40|$|The ultratrace element {{selenium}} {{is essential}} for higher animals and man. It is an active constituent of over twenty different selenoproteins from human tissues. As well, this rare nonmetal element is a potent anticarcinogen, inhibiting both chemically and virally induced tumors. The ever-increasing biological importance of Se determined us to perform the first largescale investigation of Romanian medicinal plants in what their Se content is concerned, and to evaluate the extraction ratio of this element during decoction. ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry) analysis revealed average Se contents of 43 μg/kg dry matter. The highest Se content was found in aerial parts (average of 60 μg/kg), followed by leaves (58), roots (54), flowers (35) and fruits (12). Species grown on limestone weathering soils are significantly richer in Se than the ones grown on granite or phyllite. Outstanding Se contents were measured for samples of Betula pendula leaves – 381, 131 and 113 μg Se/kg, Agrimonia eupatoria herb - 332 μg/kg, and Galium verum herb – 287 μg/kg. The extraction ratio of Se through decoction ranges from 4 % (<b>valerian</b> <b>roots)</b> to 83 % (chicory roots). The Se content and the high amounts of flavonoids in birch, agrimony and yellow bedstraw underline {{the value of these}} plants in the auxiliary treatment of various free-radical mediated diseases...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal is to}} {{calculate}} the efficiency criteria of the technological process of percolation of Turkestan <b>valerian</b> <b>roots</b> and rhizomes, to work out an optimal technology for obtaining a thick extract of Turkestan valerian. Materials and methods. In the experiment used roots and rhizomes of Turkestan valerian, purified water and ethanol of 96 % pharmacopoeial quality. When determining the optimum extraction conditions 70 % ethyl alcohol {{was used as the}} extractant. The extraction method is percolation. Each extract fraction was taken at a DER 1 : 1 step, the amount of dry residue in each fraction was estimated and the main indices of the process dynamics were calculated. Results. The total yield of extractives from 100 g of the raw materials was 10. 79 g, which is more than 12. 44 %. The maximum number of stages of extraction for obtaining a thick extract is 7, a further increase in portions of the extractant does not lead to {{a significant increase in the}} yield of the finished product, which indicates the depletion of the raw material. Тhe optimal technology for getting a thick extract consists of the following classical steps: grinding raw materials, preparing the extractant, preparing herbal raw materials, infusion, percolation, settling, filtration, evaporation, packaging and marking. Conclusion. Based on the conducted research, a technology for obtaining a thick extract from the roots and rhizomes of Turkestan valerian has been tested and experimentally substantiated, a laboratory regulation and methods for its standardization have been developed...|$|R

40|$|Dried <b>valerian</b> (Valeriana officinalis) <b>root</b> powder was {{stored at}} 5, 14 and 30 °C under low, {{moderate}} and high humidity conditions for 6 months, {{and the level}} of the valerenic acids monitored on a monthly basis. From an initial moisture content of 5 g/kg, the moisture level during storage decreased in root powder stored at low humidity and increased during storage at high humidity, with the effect greatest at 30 °C. The concentration of valerenic acid significantly decreased over time and was affected by temperature and humidity with the loss greatest at 30 °C in low humidity. Acetoxyvalerenic acid also decreased over time but with greatest loss at 30 °C and high humidity. Hydroxyvalerenic acid was not detected in the fresh sample but was present in all stored samples and tended to reflect the decrease in acetoxyvalerenic acid. The concentration of total valerenic acids essentially mirrored the change in valerenic acid. It is concluded that maximum retention of valerenic acids would be achieved by storing valerian at a temperature lower than about 14 °C with humidity not a great concern. If storage is to occur at higher temperatures, retention of valerenic acids is favoured by storage under a high humidity but such a recommendation is not considered practical due to the risk of microbial growth and increasing difficulty of postharvest handling of moist material...|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{relaxation}} drink first emerged from Japan in 2005 {{when a group}} of products were introduced to the market enriched with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
