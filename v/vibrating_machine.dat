This study examined the occurrence of Raynaud′s phenomenon among {{men and women with}} noise-induced hearing loss in relation to vibration exposure. All 342 participants had a confirmed noise-induced hearing loss medico legally accepted as work-related by AFA Insurance. Each subject answered a questionnaire concerning their health status and the kinds of exposures they had at the time when their hearing loss was first discovered. The questionnaire covered types of exposures, discomforts in the hands or fingers, diseases and medications affecting the blood circulation, the use of alcohol and tobacco and for women, the use of hormones and whether they had been pregnant. The participation rate was 41 % (n = 133) with 38 % (n = 94) for men and 50 % (n = 39) for women. 84 men and 36 women specified if they had Raynaud′s phenomenon and also if they had used hand-held <b>vibrating</b> <b>machines.</b> Nearly 41 % of them had used hand-held <b>vibrating</b> <b>machines</b> and 18 % had used <b>vibrating</b> <b>machines</b> at least 2 h each workday.

The aims of this thesis were 1) to obtain deeper insight and further knowledge of HAVS and the consequences for hand function, and aspects of quality of life (QoL); 2) to investigate the usefulness of clinical assessments in diagnosing HAVS; 3) to evaluate a treatment method for patients with severe cold intolerance. The thesis is based on five papers {{and a total of}} 131 vibration exposed workers. A number of questions on hand symptoms, standardised tests of hand function and questionnaires were included. Results: 1) The most common hand symptoms were cold intolerance, numbness and pain. Sensory functions were more disturbed than motor functions in clinical assessments. Working outdoors in cold weather, using <b>vibrating</b> <b>machines,</b> opening lids and packages, writing, lifting and carrying objects appeared more difficult than other activities. Workers with HAVS described lower QoL here expressed as less subjective well-being, more symptoms of ill-health and ADL difficulties than workers without symptoms. 2) Cold intolerance and pain showed a high agreement with the Stockholm Workshop Scales (SWS), the gold standard in diagnosing HAVS. Three out of ten objective tests of hand function, assessing perception of vibration, perception of touch/pressure, and dexterity showed a moderate agreement with SWS. Thus, corresponding defined objective tests of hand function (Tactilometry, Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, and Purdue pegboard test) combined with questions on cold intolerance and pain, together with the SWS can be helpful for diagnosing HAVS. 3) Behavioural treatment of cold intolerance was not effective in workers with HAVS although digital skin temperature increased after treatment. The results indicated that the subjective assessment of cold intolerance did not correlate with the objective assessment of digital skin temperature. The findings highlight the lack of knowledge of the nature and pathophysiology of cold intolerance. Conclusion: 1) HAVS can result in impaired hand function and lower QoL 2) Specific tests of hand function and questions of hand symptoms can be useful for detecting a vibration injury. 3) Since no treatment of HAVS has proved effective, prophylactic measures should be further highlighted...|$|R
