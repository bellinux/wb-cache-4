40|$|Twelve {{subjects}} with type II hyperlipoproteine-mia (elevated low density lipoprotein choles-terol) were studied (table 1). Informed {{consent was obtained}} from all subjects according to National Institutes of Health guidelines. Patients abstained from all medications known to affect platelet function; medications to control lipid levels are indicated in table 1. We studied 35 normal controls, aged 18 to 32 years, who showed no evidence of atheroscle-rotic disease, and who had normal fasting lipid levels and no history of platelet dysfunction. Of these controls, 10 also underwent 51 Cr platelet survival measurement. Controls also avoided all medications known to affect platelet function dur-ing the study period. Lipoprotein Type Classification Lipoprotein phenotypes and genotypes were established by clinical appearance, fasting cho-lesterol and triglyceride levels, paper electropho-resis of plasma lipoproteins, family studies, low density lipoprotein receptor studies, and quanti-tative ultracentrifugation of plasma lipopro-teins. 12 " 14 Patients were classified as MA if their low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was ele-vated and their very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol was normal; they were classi-fied as I IB if both their VLDL and LDL cholesterol levels were elevated. Assessment of Atherosclerotic Disease All patients underwent a routine physical exam-ination, cardiac fluoroscopy and electrocardiog-raphy. A group of nine subjects (<b>VC,</b> <b>VaC,</b> TH...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of poly(vinyl acetate) -b-poly(vinyl chloride) (PVAc-b-PVC) block copolymers by Cobalt-Mediated Radical Polymerization (CMRP) is investigated {{for the first}} time in this paper. A PVAc–Co(acac) 2 macroinitiator is prepared by CMRP using the V- 70 /Co(acac) 2 binary system or a preformed alkylcobalt(III) compound. Then, the block copolymerization occurs in the bulk at 40 °C by the addition of VC. The addition of water to the polymerization medium or the slow generation of alkyl radicals during the whole polymerization is beneficial to the process by consuming part of the excess of deactivator (Co(acac) 2) that blocks the polymer chains into the dormant form. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements and AFM analyses evidence that the PVAc-b-PVC forms core–shell micelles in a selective solvent of the PVAc block, i. e. methanol, evidencing the blocky structure of the copolymer. PVAc-b-P(VC-co-VAc) copolymers are also successfully prepared by initiating the radical copolymerization of <b>VC</b> and <b>VAc</b> at 40 °C from a PVAc–Co(acac) 2 macroinitiator.

40|$|The cobalt {{mediated}} {{radical polymerization}} (CMRP) of vinyl chloride (VC) {{in the presence}} of bis(acetylacetonato) cobalt(II) (Co(acac) 2) as a controlling agent is presented for the first time. Using an alkyl-Co(III) compound (R 0 –(CH 2 –CHOAc) < 4 –Co(acac) 2; R 0 = (H 3 C) 2 (OCH 3) C–CH 2 –C(CH 3) (CN) –) as an initiator, the bulk polymerization under non-isotherm conditions is controlled. 1 H NMR spectra of the resulting PVC show that the CMRP process does not significantly affect the level of defects compared to a PVC prepared by a conventional free radical polymerization at the same temperature. Using the same alkyl-cobalt(III) compound, the copolymerization of <b>VC</b> and <b>VAc</b> is controlled at 40 °C provided that enough VAc (about 40 mol%) is present in the polymerization medium to moderate the VC polymerization. In line with reactivity ratios, VC is preferentially incorporated in the polymer at {{the early stages of the}} polymerization, leading to copolymers with a high VC content at moderate conversions. This is the first report of a CMRP of VC and of the synthesis of well-defined statistical PVC-co-PVAc copolymers by this technique. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The radiation-induced graft polymerizations {{of various}} {{monomers}} were studied in gas phase onto polyethylene and onto butadiene or isoprene pre-grafted polyethylene. Crosslinking of polyethylene took place simultaneously with the grafting. The graft polymerization rates of VC 1 and CTFE increased with reaction time {{in early stage}} of the reaction. The specificrate of graft polymerization, kg=R/[M], was in the order, methyl methacrylate (MMA) >styrene (St) >methyl acrylate (MA) > vinyl acetate (<b>VAc)</b> >vinyl chloride (<b>VC</b> 1) >chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE). The specific rate in-creased with the increasing monomer reactivity in the addition of polyethylene radical to monomer and with the decreasing ones in the reactions of chain transfer to monomer and termination. The rate ratio of graft polymerizations onto diene pre-grafted polyethylene and onto original one was in the order, MMA> St> MA> CTFE> VAc> VC 1. While, gel fraction of the polymer obtained in the graft polymerization onto diene pre-grafted polyethylene was higher than that onto original one. The efficiency of grafted monomer for crosslinking was in the order, CTFE>VCl> VAc> MA> St> MMA. This efficiency was remarkably high in the graft polymerization of CTFE, <b>VC</b> 1, and <b>VAc</b> onto diene pre-grafted polyethylene. The effects of unsaturations contained in polyethylene on the rate of grafting {{and the degree of}} gel formation of polymer were discussed in connection with the reactivities of propagating radicals to the unsaturations and of the monomers to polyethylene radical...|$|R
