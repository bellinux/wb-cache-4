2500|$|Dawkins {{continues}} {{with a discussion}} of what he sees as a conflict between faith and science (see conflict thesis). He points out that science involves a process of constantly testing and revising theories in the light of new evidence, while faith makes a virtue out of believing unprovable and often improbable propositions. For an example of faith, Dawkins takes the infallible doctrine of the Assumption, which Pope Pius XII declared in 1950 by relying upon tradition. He contrasts this with the scientific method, which he describes as a system whereby working assumptions may be falsified by recourse to reason and evidence. Dawkins provides an example from his undergraduate study, when a <b>visiting</b> <b>researcher</b> disproved a hypothesis of a professor, who accepted the outcome with [...] "My dear fellow, I wish to thank you, I have been wrong these fifteen years." ...|$|E
