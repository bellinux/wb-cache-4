25|$|Speed bumps (or speed breakers) are {{the common}} {{name for a}} family of traffic calming devices that use <b>vertical</b> <b>deflection</b> to slow motor-vehicle traffic in order to improve safety conditions. Variations include the speed hump, speed cushion, and speed table.|$|E
25|$|Each {{of these}} devices {{can be made from}} a variety of materials, {{including}} asphalt, concrete, recycled plastic, metal, or vulcanized rubber. Several trade-offs must be made when selecting the material for a new speed cushion. Traditionally most <b>vertical</b> <b>deflection</b> devices have been constructed of asphalt or concrete. Due to the rigidity and durability of these materials, they have more permanence and are more effective at slowing traffic. However, they can be difficult to shape and form into consistent forms and precise dimensions.|$|E

Transform data {{points to a}} new Cartesian coordinates composing of osculating tangent plane and normal of reference ellipsoid. Then, simulate tangent plane of regional geoid by using a least squares approach with least total distance squares between discrete points and simulative plane in order to determinate mean value of each component of <b>vertical</b> <b>deflections.</b> We make an imitated experimentation in South China Sea.

500|$|The chassis had {{originally}} been designed with a six-wheeled Schachtellaufwerk interleaved-roadwheel suspension (as German half-tracks had already adopted), but the German Army amended this to a torsion bar system. Permitting greater <b>vertical</b> <b>deflection</b> of the roadwheels, this was intended to improve performance and crew comfort both on- and off-road. However, due to the urgent requirement for the new tank, neither proposal was adopted, and Krupp instead equipped it with a simple leaf spring double-bogie suspension, with eight rubber-rimmed [...] roadwheels per side.|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{as early}} as 1973, only seven years after the {{beginning}} of production, the French began a research program for a future modification of the tank. The project was {{to result in a}} [...] AMX 30 Valorisé ("upgraded AMX-30"). In June 1979, the French Army decided to both build new and modernize existing AMX-30s with an improved fire control system and a new transmission, and designated them AMX-30B2s. The first new production vehicles were taken into service in January 1982. Improvements to the COTAC APX M-508 fire control system included the installation of a laser rangefinder and a low-light TV (LLTV). The main gun's lethality was improved with the introduction of a new armour piercing fin stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS). The original engine was exchanged for an improved variant, known as the HS-110.2, producing [...] The poor transmission was replaced with the semi-automatic [...] transmission (now RENK France), with a torque converter. The suspension was improved by adopting new torsion bars and shocks, which increased the <b>vertical</b> <b>deflection</b> range of the road wheels, thereby improving the tank's off-road mobility. From 1998, the French army started to replace the engines of its remaining AMX-30 tanks and variants with 500 Renault Mack E9 750hp engines.|$|E

For this assessment in Britain, there has been the additional need to transform the observed relative <b>vertical</b> <b>deflections</b> to absolute ones. Not applying horizontal datum transformations led to spurious results, so absolute <b>vertical</b> <b>deflections</b> must always be used to assess EGMs. Three datum transformations were trialled (three-parameter, seven-parameter and OSTN 02), which show similar results when considering the estimated ~ 0. 3 " precision of these historical (1950 to 1976) astrogeodetic observations. Several other problems were encountered because of the historical nature of the data, comprising destruction of survey pillars, ambiguous station names, and a mixture of horizontal geodetic datums available in Britain...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the computation {{and analysis of}} the Earth’s short-scale gravity field through high-resolution gravity forward modelling using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) global topography model. We use the established residual terrain modelling technique along with advanced computational resources and massive parallelisation to convert the high-pass filtered SRTM topography – complemented with bathymetric information in coastal zones – to implied short-scale gravity effects. The result is the ERTM 2160 model (Earth Residual Terrain Modelled-gravity field with the spatial scales equivalent to spherical-harmonic coefficients up to degree 2160 removed). ERTM 2160, used successfully for the construction of the GGMplus gravity maps, approximates the short-scale (i. e., ~ 10 km down to ~ 250 m) gravity field in terms of gravity disturbances, quasi/geoid heights and <b>vertical</b> <b>deflections</b> at ~ 3 billion gridded points within ± 60 latitude. ERTM 2160 reaches maximum values for the quasi/geoid height of ~ 30 cm, gravity disturbance in excess of 100 mGal, and <b>vertical</b> <b>deflections</b> of ~ 30 arc-seconds over the Himalaya mountains. Analysis of the ERTM 2160 field as a function of terrain roughness shows in good approximation a linear relationship between terrain roughness and gravity effects, with values of ~ 1. 7 cm (quasi/geoid heights), ~ 11 mGal (gravity disturbances) and 1. 5 arc-seconds (<b>vertical</b> <b>deflections)</b> signal strength per 100 m standard deviation of the terrain. These statistics can be used to assess the magnitude of omitted gravity signals over various types of terrain when using degree- 2160 gravity models such as EGM 2008. Applications for ERTM 2160 are outlined including its use in gravity smoothing procedures, augmentation of EGM 2008, fill-in for future ultra-high resolution gravity models in spherical harmonics, or calculation of localised or global power spectra of Earth’s short-scale gravity field.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{high-resolution}} lunar gravity field model (LGM 2011) that provides gravity accelerations, free-air gravity anomalies, selenoid undulations and <b>vertical</b> <b>deflections</b> {{over the entire}} Moon’s surface. LGM 2011 {{is based on the}} Japanese SELENE mission that provides the low- and medium-frequency constituents of the gravity field, down to spatial scales of ~ 78 km. At spatial scales between ~ 78 km and ~ 1. 5 km, LGM 2011 uses high-frequency topographic information derived from LOLA laser altimetry to approximate the gravity field signatures of many medium- and small-size impact craters for the first time. For the topography-based gravity approximation, we use Newtonian forward-modelling under the key assumptions that the SELENE and LOLA data are consistent, the high-frequency lunar topography is uncompensated and the topographic mass density is constant. The short-scale component of LGM 2011 should not be relied upon in geophysical interpretations. LGM 2011 can be used as an a priori model for lunar gravity field simulation and inversion studies, evaluation of past and future lunar gravity field missions, improved topographic mapping, lunar inertial navigation, and the prediction of lunar gravity acceleration and <b>vertical</b> <b>deflections</b> at any future landing sites...|$|R
