40|$|The {{increasing}} complexity {{with the}} decrease in size of EEE – components (Electronic, electric and electromagnetic) raises the question on how higher energy frequencies will affect the components and their continuous development. The most common <b>vibration</b> <b>testing</b> <b>equipment</b> currently in use within the automotive industry and SCANIA CV AB are the electrodynamic shaker (ED system). This thesis covers the characteristics of different <b>vibration</b> <b>testing</b> <b>equipment</b> while analysing their strengths and weaknesses, {{not only for the}} automotive industry but also including equipment more commonly handled within the aero and space industry. The project aims to find a complement for the ED system and study the possibility for its replacement in the automotive industry. In particular, experiments are carried out and documented on a so-called “Repeatable shaker system” (RS system) for the purpose to get a better understanding on the functions of the equipment and its overall differences compared to the electrodynamic system when it comes to random <b>vibration</b> <b>testing.</b> It became clear that complementing or replacing the ED system is difficult and that the RS system work fundamentally different in comparison. Accordingly, the RS system is not a potential replacement for our purpose and it cannot perform at the same level of precision but instead is able to achieve higher energy frequencies overall, making it still ideal for its intended purposes, but not as a replacement of the ED system...|$|R

40|$|Vibration is {{commonly}} encountered {{during the life}} time of electronic components. It is {{a major cause of}} failure due to cyclic strain and stress that give rise to damage in the materials making up the component. The recent move from lead to lead-free soldering by the electronics industry has necessitated the generation of material properties data that will allow accurate prediction of the lead-free solder's performance under vibration conditions. To assess the reliability of lead-free solders under vibration loading, test equipment has been designed for small solder joints using a piezoelectric cell as the vibration source.

40|$|International audienceThere {{is now a}} {{considerable}} increase {{on the part of}} universities in the incursion into the development of nanosatellite missions. In the aerospace sector, almost every operation is full of risks and big investments of time and money, and to locate a nanosatellite in orbit, even smaller, is not the exception. Therefore, it is imperative to know if the nanosatellite will be prepared to surpass any critical moment. The rockets or launchers in which the nanosatellites are placed for going to space, produce strong vibrations that can affect the nanosatellite. The primary objective of this work is to design a <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> that will help determine the resistance of a nanosatellite against the sudden movements that can be experienced within the space launcher. And for that, what is wanted, is that this equipment can generate the vibrations and recreate them as equal as they are in an original launcher. The idea is to guarantee that the nanosatellite will not present problems or failures during the launching and putting in Orbit. This step would be the most critical moment for a nanosatellite, therefore, what is sought with this is to ensure the significant investments of study time and money made by the government or any entity dedicated to the scientific and technological development, since this would have the security that will fulfil the objective for which was planned...|$|E
40|$|Producing a {{noiseless}} and vibration free devices {{is a need}} of the day. The vibration causes rapid wear {{of machine}} parts such as bearings and gears. Unwanted vibrations may cause loosening of parts from the machine. Because of improper design or material distribution, the wheels of locomotive can leave the track due to excessive vibration which results in accident or heavy loss. Sometimes because of heavy vibrations proper readings of instrument cannot be taken. Vibration {{can be used for}} useful purposes such as <b>vibration</b> <b>testing</b> <b>equipment's,</b> vibratory conveyors, hoppers, and comparators. Vibration is found to be very fruitful in mechanical workshops such as improving the efficiency of machining, casting, forging and welding techniques. The transfer of noise can also be reduced by decoupling the components {{in such a way that}} the noise path is interrupted. This can be achieved by adding noise reducing treatments to the structure such as elastic elements, masses, local shielding or damping layers. In the present investigation, the use of viscoelastic damping layers as a noise reducing measure in rotating machinery is considered. Here in this investigation the result obtained will give frequency value in random manner and the use of t-test (testing hypothesis) will show us that vibrations are really reduced or not...|$|R

40|$|The modal {{identification}} {{is a common}} and necessary procedure performed on large aerospace structures. Aeronautical structures like prototype of new large aircraft have to be investigated within a ground <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> (GVT) in order to validate the analytical Finite Element Model and to enable reliable flutter predictions for flight tests. Spacecraft structures like large satellites are investigated by so called modal survey tests. Here, the main purpose is also to validate the analytical model. With the validated model the severe dynamic loads which emerge during launch can be predicted. The dynamics of aeronautical structures and spacecraft are characterized by their modal parameters like natural frequencies, mode shapes, modal damping and generalized masses. These modal parameters can be obtained using two different philosophies resp. methods: Modes, which are important {{within the scope of}} the certification process can be identified using the phase resonance method. On the other hand, not all modes have to be known with the same precision and to the same extent, e. g. including linearity checks. Here, phase separation techniques, which are nowadays standard in the modal analysis of large aerospace structures, can save time compared with the phase resonance method. In this lecture the theory of modal identification methods is presented. After that we focuses on the performance of <b>vibration</b> <b>tests.</b> The <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> is described in detail.

40|$|For {{fast and}} {{accurate}} motion of 6 -axis articulated robot, more noble motion control strategy is needed. In general, the movement strategy of industrial robots {{can be divided}} into two kinds, PTP (Point to Point) and CP (Continuous Path). Recently, industrial robots which should be co-worked with machine tools are increasingly needed for performing various jobs, as well as simple handling or welding. Therefore, in order to cope with high-speed handling of the cooperation of industrial robots with machine tools or other devices, CP should be implemented so as to reduce vibration and noise, as well as decreasing operation time. This paper will realize CP motion (especially joint-linear) blending in 3 -dimensional space for a 6 -axis articulated (lab-manufactured) robot (called as “RS 2 ”) by using LabVIEW ® (6) programming, based on a parametric interpolation. Another small contribution of this paper is the proposal of motion blending simulation technique based on Recurdyn ® V 7 and Solidworks®, in order to figure out whether the joint-linear blending motion can generate the stable motion of robot in the sense of velocity magnitude at the end-effector of robot or not. In order to evaluate the performance of joint-linear motion blending, simple PTP (i. e., linear-linear) is also physically implemented on RS 2. The implementation results of joint-linear motion blending and PTP are compared in terms of vibration magnitude and travel time by using the <b>vibration</b> <b>testing</b> <b>equipment</b> of Medallion of Zonic®.

However, a search of the literature reveals a lack of experimental verification of the theory. This is probably due to the general unavailability of suitable experimental apparatus such as the Westinghouse <b>vibration</b> fatigue <b>testing</b> <b>equipment</b> recently acquired by the United States Naval Postgraduate School, and {{which is one of the}} first commercial units of this type to be built.

40|$|Vibration of {{mechanical}} equipment in structures {{can result in}} fatigue, detection, and/or environmental concerns. Numerical simulation of these mechanical/structural systems to verify the system meets these performance requirements can be difficult and can require full system testing. During the design phase of a system, however, the mechanical portion of the system may be pre-existing and can be physically tested while the support structure is still existent as a computer aided design concept which can be numerically simulated. The challenge in verifying the full system meets performance requirements is to accurately combine the physical and numerical substructures. One forma of substructuring, where physical and numerical substructures are combined for dynamic testing in real-time as a feedback loop, is called real-time hybrid substructuring. This research proposes to extend and demonstrate RTHS for the system level <b>vibration</b> <b>testing</b> {{of mechanical}} <b>equipment.</b> The overall approach to extend RTHS for system level <b>vibration</b> <b>testing</b> of mechanical <b>equipment</b> involves {{the analysis of the}} dynamics of a notional multiple degree of freedom (MDOF) mechanical system to demonstrate the need and application of RTHS for mechanical equipment and the implementation of compensation techniques for a uni-directional MDOF servo-hydraulic shake table serving as the transfer system to interface between the physical and numerical substructures. These research efforts will specifically address the unique challenges encountered in the application of RTHS to mechanical equipment including nonlinearities of the transfer system actuator dynamics due to low amplitude high bandwidth demands and the application of RTHS to lightly damped substructures. Experimental results demonstrate that RTHS accurately captures the system-level response and allows for repeatable tests of various dynamic conditions and potential system improvements to be efficiently examined...|$|R
