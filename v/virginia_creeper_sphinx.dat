50|$|Darapsa myron (<b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper</b> <b>sphinx)</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Sphingidae. It lives from Maine south to south Florida; west to North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Texas. It also {{can be found in}} Mexico. There are 2 or 3 broods in much of the range, and larvae can mature in as few as 3 weeks. Larvae hide on the midribs of their host leaves and are nocturnal feeders. During July and August, this species is {{abundant}} in many areas, particularly Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Adults emerge in the mid-afternoon and females begin calling after dusk. In spring, adults are more likely to feed, nectaring from flowers and drinking fluids from rotting fruit. In areas where they are common, D. myron readily come to both lights and sugar baits, being most active between sunset and midnight. Females have much rounder abdomens while the end of the male's abdomen is spade-shaped. Pairing is fairly quick and captive adults {{do not need to be}} fed, although females lay more eggs when fed. Sometimes adults refuse food altogether.Mated females deposit up to 150 small eggs that start out green but turn yellow within 48 hours, indicating fertility. Incubation lasts about 6 days. Fully grown larvae turn a purplish brown before spinning a sparse, wiry cocoon among host leaves. Pupae either eclose within about 24 days or diapause, eclosing in late May.|$|E
50|$|It is {{very closely}} related to <b>Virginia</b> <b>Creeper</b> (P. quinquefolia), differing only in its means of climbing, the tendrils twining around plant stems, not having the sticky pads found on the tendrils of <b>Virginia</b> <b>Creeper.</b> One {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} (unlike <b>Virginia</b> <b>Creeper)</b> it cannot climb smooth walls, only through shrubs and trees. The leaf shape, and also the brilliant fall colors, are indistinguishable from <b>Virginia</b> <b>Creeper.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper</b> (Parthenocissus quinquefolia) vines {{can look}} like poison ivy. The younger leaves can consist of three {{leaflets}} but {{have a few more}} serrations along the leaf edge, and the leaf surface is somewhat wrinkled. However, most <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper</b> leaves have five leaflets. <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper</b> and poison ivy very often grow together, even on the same tree. Even those who do not get an allergic reaction to poison ivy may be allergic to the oxalate crystals in <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper</b> sap.|$|R
