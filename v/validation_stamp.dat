The other type is inscribed ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE. The validation stamps were applied at Marshall Hole's office.|$|E
5000|$|A year earlier, Ira Kalb, a {{professor}} of marketing at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business, had done research into how big the Oscar payoff could be for a victorious film. [...] "When used in marketing campaigns, this <b>validation</b> <b>stamp</b> increases the desire of moviegoers to see the films and the talent being honored," [...] {{he wrote in a}} Business Insider article. [...] "It also keeps the movies in theaters longer boosting box office receipts. And it substantially increases DVD, streaming, download, and cable TV revenues." ...|$|E

The traveller pays the VAT over goods in the shop, and can request a refund when leaving the European Union with the goods. General restrictions are that a traveller must be a {{resident in}} a non-EU country, has a maximum stay of 6 months when visiting the EU, purchases are made up to three months prior to export, and only goods meant for personal use are eligible for the refund. Travellers {{need to keep the}} purchase receipts and visit Customs before leaving the EU to get an export <b>validation</b> <b>stamp.</b> Receipts can then be sent back to the retailers for a refund request.|$|E
50|$|The 1919 First Provisional Issue of the Yugoslav krone was (very {{similar to}} the Banknotes of the Czechoslovak koruna (1919) issued on 1912 Austro-Hungarian {{banknotes}} (with a black validating oval overprint) in 10, 20, 50, 100, and 1,000 Kronen denominations. The 1919 Second Provisional Issue contained the same denominations of 1912 Austro-Hungarian notes, but instead of an oval overprint, adhesive stamps were used for <b>validation.</b> The <b>stamps</b> on 10, 20 and 50 kronen were bilingual (Serbo-Croatian and Slovenian), while stamps on the 100 and 1000 krone notes could be {{any of the three}} languages.|$|R

40|$|KRS or Study Plan Card, is a phase {{or process}} {{have to be}} passed through by the {{informatics}} engineering students in making {{the selection of a}} courses planning series must be passed through in the period of one semester. In the existing KRS, the KRS process was done manually. First of all, students have to take courses and signed by the homeroom lecturer, afterwards students asked for <b>validation</b> or <b>stamp</b> in the administration counter of faculty or department. The completed data of KRS shall be taken then processed as online in the computer laboratory predetermined by the university. While, to make changes, students have to report to the online KRS officer and make the process from the beginning again. Mobile technology is one of the communication technology experienced the very fast development. With all ease offered by the mobile technology followed by the increasingly sophisticated mobile instrument development, it is expected that it can be made use to make the development of mobile based online KRS system. Based on the testing of all features available in this KRS system could run properly...|$|R
25|$|BVG ride-passes {{are issued}} for {{specific}} periods of time, and most require <b>validation</b> with a <b>stamping</b> machine {{before they are}} first used. The validation shows the date and {{time of the first}} use, and where the ticket was validated (in code), and therefore when the ticket expires. For example, once validated, an all-day pass allows unlimited use from the time of purchase to 3:00 am the following day. Unlike most other metro systems, tickets in Berlin are not checked before entering tram, U-Bahn or S-Bahn stations. They are however checked by the bus drivers upon entering. On the tram, S-Bahn and U-Bahn, a proof-of-payment system is used: there are random spot checks inside by plainclothes fare inspectors who have the right to demand to see each passenger's ticket. Passengers found without a ticket or an expired/invalid ticket are fined â‚¬60 per incident. The passenger may be required to pay on the spot, and is required on the spot to give a valid address to which the relevant fine notice can be mailed (it {{does not have to be}} in Germany). On the third incident, the BVG calls the offender to court, as there is now a history of 'riding without paying'.|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) at Strathmore UniversityThe Kenya lands administration process faces many challenges arising {{from the use of}} a paper based system. Over the years, this system has come under scrutiny because of inconsistencies, irregularities and the bulk of physical records that when tampered with undermine the integrity of records kept. This problem makes it difficult to quickly and accurately verify the validity of any given title deed and has also caused an influx of counterfeit title deeds which throws ownership of land into dispute. In order to verify the authenticity of a title deed, one has to fill out forms and pay a fee at the lands offices, and then go through a slow and inefficient process due to the voluminous records associated with the current paper based system. Despite digitization efforts in 2014 aimed at streamlining service provision, title deed verification still remains a critical challenge. Financial institutions are therefore reluctant to issue loans with land as collateral because it is a slow and often inaccurate process to ascertain true ownership of land, and this may lead to loss of potential customers. Based on the challenges of identifying true land ownership by authenticating title deeds, this study will adopt the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) model which incorporates the use of a trusted third party (Certification Authority) to create digital certificates. The Nairobi Lands registry will act as the Certification Authority in this study, within which there will also be a registration function (Registration Authority or RA) and a key generator to generate a public-private key pair. The RA will confirm title land owners' details, and the CA will issue digitally signed certificates, which will be used by financial institutions to compare to physical title deeds for discrepancies, and thus authenticate them. The PKI model's ability to provide digital certificate <b>validation,</b> time <b>stamping,</b> data confidentiality and authenticity makes it a suitable choice to eliminate the authentication related challenges experienced currently. This study aims to develop a prototype using a waterfall software development model to validate the proposed title deed verification solution. The prototype will be tested to validate its accuracy and efficiency in authenticating sample title deeds...|$|R
