5000|$|At 85m long MV Lord of the Isles {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} ships in the fleet. Broadly similar to [...] at the forward end, while her aft end resembles that of [...] The car deck, open at the stern, is capable of holding up to 56 cars. She has a <b>vehicle</b> <b>hoist</b> to allow loading at the older piers.|$|R
50|$|MV Hebridean Isles design {{incorporates}} a bow visor, {{bow and stern}} ramps, and a <b>vehicle</b> <b>hoist</b> with side ramps. This made her suitable for all the routes served by the large fleet units. Her spacious car deck can accommodate almost 70 cars, with passenger accommodation on two decks forward of the hoist. One deck comprises the cafeteria furthest aft, then the entrance concourse, shop and information point, with the reclining lounge and bar towards the bow. The bar was converted to a Coffee Cabin in December 2008. Above the cafeteria is the observation lounge with crew accommodation forward of this. The bridge is on the next level at the bow. Externally there is ample deck space including, like the Isle of Arran, a deck area forward of the bridge, giving passengers a view ahead.|$|R
50|$|The game {{differs from}} other racing games {{in that the}} races take place on an {{elevated}} race track, with nothing to stop the player from accidentally driving off the side. Most race tracks in the game have gaps in them which will cause serious problems to the driver {{if he or she}} fails to clear them. If this occurs then the player's <b>vehicle</b> is <b>hoisted</b> back onto the track (by a nearby crane) which costs valuable time. Turbo {{can be used to make}} a car go faster, but it can only be used for a limited amount of time in each race.|$|R
25|$|To this day, {{rolling stock}} exchanges {{require the use}} of road vehicles. Before the {{construction}} of Waterloo International terminal in 1990, the <b>vehicles</b> were <b>hoisted</b> individually by the Armstrong Lift outside the north wall of Waterloo main line station. The procedure is now carried out using a road-mounted crane in a shaft adjacent to the depot, south of Waterloo main line station on Spur Road. This is only necessary for major maintenance work that requires lifting of the car body, as the Waterloo depot is fully equipped for routine maintenance work. The remaining stub of the siding tunnel that led to the Armstrong Lift can still be seen on the left-hand side of the train shortly after leaving Waterloo for Bank, but the lift itself was buried (along with the entire Western sidings) in 1992 as part of the construction of Waterloo International station, the terminal for Eurostar trains.|$|R
50|$|DC motors {{were the}} first type widely used, since they could be powered from {{existing}} direct-current lighting power distribution systems. A DC motor's speed can be controlled over a wide range, using either a variable supply voltage or by changing the strength of current in its field windings. Small DC motors are used in tools, toys, and appliances. The universal motor can operate on direct current but is a lightweight motor used for portable power tools and appliances. Larger DC motors are used in propulsion of electric <b>vehicles,</b> elevator and <b>hoists,</b> or in drives for steel rolling mills. The advent of power electronics has made replacement of DC motors with AC motors possible in many applications.|$|R
40|$|Automated {{material}} handling systems (AMHS) {{play a central}} role in modern wafer fabrication facilities (fabs). Typically, AMHS used in wafer fabs are based on discrete vehicle-based overhead systems such as overhead <b>hoisted</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Conveyor-based continuous flow transport (CFT) implementations are starting to gain support with the expectations that CFT systems will be capable of handling high-volume manufacturing transport requirements. This paper discusses literature related to models of conveyor systems in semiconductor fabs. A comprehensive overview of simulation-based models is provided. We also identify and discuss specific research problems and needs in the design and control of closed-loop conveyors. It is concluded that new analytical and simulation models of conveyor systems need to be developed to understand the behavior of such systems and bridge the gap between theoretical research and industry problems. ...|$|R
2500|$|Weston had a love {{of travel}} and {{encouraged}} this in his children. While in the US, between 1919 and 1921, Weston purchased a Detroit-manufactured Commerce one tonne truck with a Continental N engine. The truck was shipped to England where Weston converted it into a motor home which could sleep five. Weston painted the vehicle yellow with black trim and called it [...] "Suid Afrika". The Suid Afrika was essentially a large wooden structure on the rear chassis of the truck. Windows were placed {{at the front of}} the living quarters and in the sides of the lantern roof. The <b>vehicle</b> could be <b>hoisted</b> upright onto a ship's deck. A sign on the side read, [...] "Our mansion: 7 by 14 feet, Our field: the world, Our family: mankind." [...] and surrounding this, in a circle, [...] "Round the World." [...] Weston and his family took a tour of 18 weeks in the Suid Afrika from England to Greece. The Westons lived in Athens for two years then in May 1924, returned in the Suid Afrika to England and from there to South Africa. In 1925, Weston made extensive travels through southern Africa. In 1926, the family attempted to return to [...] England, overland. In 1927, Weston found the motor home was not suitable for the trip and returned to Cape Town. (The house in Brandfort was sold in April 1928.) ...|$|R
40|$|An Orion Crew Module Service Module Structural Weight and Center of Gravity Simulator and a <b>Vehicle</b> Motion Simulator <b>Hoist</b> Structure for Orion Service Module Umbilical Testing were {{designed}} during a summer 2014 internship in Kennedy Space Centers Structures and Mechanisms Design Branch. The simulator is {{a structure that}} supports ballast, which will be integrated into an existing Orion mock-up to simulate the mass properties of the Exploration Mission- 1 flight vehicle in both fueled and unfueled states. The simulator mimics these configurations {{through the use of}} approximately 40, 000 lbf of steel and water ballast, and a steel support structure. Draining four water tanks, which house the water ballast, transitions the simulator from the fueled to unfueled mass properties. The Ground Systems Development and Operations organization will utilize the simulator to verify and validate equipment used to maneuver and transport the Orion spacecraft in its fueled and unfueled configurations. The second design comprises a cantilevered tripod hoist structure that provides the capability to position a large Orion Service Module Umbilical in proximity to the Vehicle Motion Simulator. The Ground Systems Development and Operations organization will utilize the Vehicle Motion Simulator, with the hoist structure attached, to test the Orion Service Module Umbilical for proper operation prior to installation on the Mobile Launcher. Overall, these two designs provide NASA engineers viable concepts worthy of fabricating and placing into service to prepare for the launch of Orion in 2017...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} couple of years, a high level of {{automation}} was integrated in the factories of semiconductor industry. This implies the whole production process as well as the material delivery process. An automated material handling system (AMHS) is such an integrated automated transport solution of today's 300 mm semiconductor waferfabs. These AMHS are based on a direct delivery approach (unified) model with alternative flexible storage systems to handle surges of lots in process or unplanned events. As the 300 mm fabs are very large and the number or process and handling steps is rising, a fast and reliable transport system with short delivery times is required which, in addition, minimizes its footprint inside the expensive clean room. Currently, the implemented transport solutions are based on overhead <b>hoist</b> <b>vehicles</b> (OHV) which have to cope with several problems. On one hand there is an increasing traffic on the whole track system caused by the increasing number of process steps. On the other hand there is a higher number of hoist-actions as a result of new storage strategies. Instead of large central stockers, distributed tool assigned Under Track Storages (UTS) are used. Both issues mentioned can result in vehicles blocking track sections frequently. This can cuase accumulations which lead to high variances in delivery times and make the delivery time for loads in this system less predictable. An additional effect might be the increased idle times of expensive process equipments, which need to minimized. This paper describes an approach of dynamic vehicle routing and identifies simulation based improvements of the AMHS performance. Furthermore different vehicle routing strategies are presented and compared...|$|R
60|$|Michel Voss, the landlord, {{in person}} {{was at this}} time a tall, stout, active, and very {{handsome}} man, about fifty years of age. As his son was already twenty-five--and {{was known to be}} so throughout the commune--people were sure that Michel Voss was fifty or thereabouts; but there was very little in his appearance to indicate so many years. He was fat and burly to be sure; but then he was not fat to lethargy, or burly with any sign of slowness. There was still the spring of youth in his footstep, and when there was some weight to be lifted, some heavy timber to be thrust here or there, some huge lumbering <b>vehicle</b> to be <b>hoisted</b> in or out, there was no arm about the place so strong as that of the master. His short, dark, curly hair--that was always kept clipped round his head--was beginning to show a tinge of gray, but the huge moustache on his upper lip was still of a thorough brown, as was also the small morsel of beard which he wore upon his chin. He had bright sharp brown eyes, a nose slightly beaked, and a large mouth. He was on the whole a man of good temper, just withal, and one who loved those who belonged to him; but he chose to be master in his own house, and was apt to think that his superior years enabled him to know what younger people wanted better than they would know themselves. He was loved in his house and respected in his village; but there was something in the beak of his nose and the brightness of his eye which was apt to make those around him afraid of him. And indeed Michel Voss could lose his temper and become an angry man.|$|R
