5|$|A third form of progeny {{arises when}} F1 hybrids are bred with animals genetically {{dissimilar}} to their parents. If heterozygosity is maintained or increased as a result, hybrid <b>vigour</b> and other production benefits {{occurring in the}} F1 generation will be maintained or increased. Maintenance of heterozygosity {{is the key to}} maintaining the highest levels of hybrid <b>vigour.</b> This requires complex breeding programmes and high levels of management. Simplified crossbreeding programmes have been developed using hybrid or composite bulls, which was the motivation behind the development of Lim-Flex hybrids.|$|E
5|$|The use of Lim-Flex and Brahmousin sires {{over a third}} {{breed of}} cow would benefit most from {{increased}} hybrid <b>vigour,</b> which should minimise any reduction in carcase value arising {{from the loss of}} the F94L mutation.|$|E
5|$|A variant {{from the}} Gibson area has an upright habit and leaves. Otherwise, Banksia speciosa shows little {{variation}} across its range. Combined with its <b>vigour</b> and prominence in its habitat, {{this has led}} George to speculate {{that it is a}} recent development among its relatives.|$|E
5|$|Aphids, {{mealybugs}} {{and other}} invertebrate pests can spread viruses. Symptoms {{vary with the}} species, but a loss of <b>vigour</b> is usual. Cactus virus X has been isolated from S. truncata. There is no treatment for virus diseases; {{it is recommended that}} infected plants be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Crossbred cows produce up to, and in {{some cases}} in excess of, 20% more weaned calf weight as a result of {{increased}} reproductive performance and maternal ability. Crossbred cow longevity is also increased by up to two years when compared with straightbred cows. However, the benefits of hybrid <b>vigour</b> in a crossbred cow decline in subsequent generations if progeny are mated to cattle of parentage similar to the cow, and increase if a new breed is introduced. Although studies acknowledge that the major production benefits of hybrid <b>vigour</b> occur in crossbred cow herds, the main use of Limousins outside of Europe continues to be as terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds.|$|E
5|$|Lure {{coursing}} is a {{sport for}} dogs based on hare coursing, but involving dogs chasing a mechanically operated lure. Some critics of hare coursing suggest that coursers could test their dogs through lure coursing. However, coursers believe that, while lure coursing is good athletic exercise for their dogs, {{it does not}} approximate the testing <b>vigour</b> and sport of live coursing.|$|E
5|$|Progeny of {{two parents}} of {{different}} breeds are termed F1 hybrids, F1 crosses or first crosses. F1 hybrids generally have an extremely uniform phenotype {{and benefit from}} hybrid <b>vigour.</b> These advantages are observed in the breeding {{of a wide variety}} of animals and plants, and arise because progeny inherit one of each paired gene from each parent. When both parents are homozygous for different variants of genes (known as alleles), which is likely to be the case when a breed has been developed and selected over several generations, progeny will inherit both gene variants present in the parents. The F1 hybrid progeny will then be heterozygous for each gene variant, which in turn increases the likelihood that the genes will code for an optimal protein or enzyme. This is the genetic basis of hybrid <b>vigour.</b> While many gene variants have effects that are of little consequence to beef production, a few, such as the myostatin variants found in different cattle breeds, have a major effect.|$|E
5|$|The City of London {{initiatives}} in Old East London {{are helping to}} create {{a renewed sense of}} <b>vigour</b> in the East London Business District. Specific {{initiatives in}}clude the creation of the Old East Heritage Conservation District under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act, special Building Code policies and Facade Restoration Programs.|$|E
5|$|The Ordinances were {{published}} widely on 11 October, {{with the intention}} of obtaining maximum popular support. The decade following their publication saw a constant struggle over their repeal or continued existence. Although they were not finally repealed until May 1322, the <b>vigour</b> with which they were enforced depended on who was in control of government.|$|E
5|$|The post-war period {{witnessed}} both {{expansion and}} the commissioning of new products. The company always ensured its products {{were covered by}} patent and trade mark, a policy prosecuted with <b>vigour</b> from the outset. The early 1920s saw the wholesale and export {{side of the business}} move to Notting Hill Gate, close to the pipe and cigarette division located at Campden Hill Road.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{stint as}} Minister of Commerce {{significantly}} raised his international profile and generated media attention both in China and abroad. Described as good-looking, articulate and open-minded in {{his approach to}} problems, Bo's rise from a municipal official to the central government generated great media fanfare and elevated his status to something of a 'political star.' Bo's political persona was considered {{a departure from the}} generally serious and conservative leadership in Beijing. With his youthful <b>vigour,</b> populism, and purported popularity with female reporters, Bo's political rise had been compared to that of John F. Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|Crossbreeding {{increases}} {{production efficiency}} because of hybrid <b>vigour,</b> and allows complementary traits of {{parents to be}} combined to produce progeny better suited to different environments or markets. Crossbreeding {{through the use of}} Limousin terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds allows the complementary traits of higher marbling and fat cover provided by the British breed cows, and required or preferred by some markets, to be combined with the higher yield and feed conversion efficiency of Limousin sires.|$|E
5|$|David Kinsley, {{an expert}} on Hindu goddesses and former Professor of Religion at McMaster University, agrees with the Buddhist origin theory, but sees other influences, too. Ancient Hindu goddesses, who are {{depicted}} nude and headless or faceless, may have also influenced the development of Chhinnamasta. These goddesses are mainly depicted headless {{to focus on the}} display of their sexual organs, thus signifying sexual <b>vigour,</b> but they do not explain the self-decapitation theme.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} fighting between the rebels and the Byzantines continued. Although the Bulgarian forces were cut in two following the Byzantine landing at Varna, heavy clashes {{erupted in the}} eastern Balkan mountains with new <b>vigour,</b> especially around the Kotel Pass and the Varbitsa Pass. The Bulgarian positions there were surrounded both {{from the north and}} the south. The Byzantines had to besiege and take the fortresses one by one which cost time and casualties. Many strongholds remained unconquered and permanently engaged large Byzantine forces.|$|E
5|$|It is {{so similar}} in {{morphology}} and habits to the carrion crow (Corvus corone), {{for many years}} they were considered by most authorities to be geographical races of one species. Hybridization observed where their ranges overlapped added weight to this view. However, since 2002, the hooded crow has been elevated to full species status after closer observation; the hybridisation was less than expected and hybrids had decreased <b>vigour.</b> Within the hooded crow species, four subspecies are recognized, with one, the Mesopotamian crow, possibly distinct enough to warrant species status itself.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the British {{discovery}} of the iconic Charnia in 1957 that the pre-Cambrian was seriously considered as containing life. This frond-shaped fossil was found in England's Charnwood Forest, and due to the detailed geological mapping of the British Geological Survey there was no doubt these fossils sat in Precambrian rocks. Palaeontologist Martin Glaessner finally, in 1959, made the connection between this and the earlier finds and with a combination of improved dating of existing specimens and an injection of <b>vigour</b> into the search many more instances were recognised.|$|E
5|$|One word {{more about}} the bawdy, and I have done. I own the first night this thing was acted, some indecencies had like to have happened, {{but it was not}} my fault. The fine gentleman of the play, {{drinking}} his mistress's health in Nantes brandy from six in the morning to the time he waddled upon the stage in the evening, had toasted himself up to such a pitch of <b>vigour,</b> I confess I once gave Amanda for gone.|$|E
5|$|This {{magnificent}} {{and tragic}} satire criticizes {{the prototype of}} the Latin American dictator who appeared in several places {{at the beginning of}} the century and has since reappeared, his existence being fostered by the mechanism of tyranny which, for the common man, makes every day a hell on earth. The passionate <b>vigour</b> with which Asturias evokes the terror and distrust which poisoned the social atmosphere of the time makes his work a challenge and an invaluable aesthetic gesture.|$|E
5|$|Threats to B.brownii include loss {{of habitat}} due to land clearing, {{commercial}} exploitation, disease, and {{changes to the}} fire regime. The fragmentation of populations is also of concern, as it causes the genetic diversity of the species to decline, potentially reducing <b>vigour.</b> Climate change is also of concern: depending on the severity of change, the range of this species is predicted to contract by 30% to 50% by 2080.|$|E
5|$|Winston Churchill was {{impressed}} by Henson. Grimley comments that they had much in common, both spending years as isolated figures speaking out for beliefs that were dismissed {{at the time and}} later vindicated. As prime minister, Churchill persuaded Henson out of retirement in 1940 to resume his old duties as a Canon of Westminster Abbey. After overcoming the momentary strangeness of being back in his old post after nearly thirty years he preached with <b>vigour</b> until cataracts made his eyesight too poor to continue. He retired from the Abbey in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Cockfighting {{is said to}} be the world's oldest spectator {{sport and}} may have {{originated}} in Persia 6,000 years ago. Two mature males (cocks or roosters) are set to fight each other, and will do so with great <b>vigour</b> until one is critically injured or killed. Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour. The sport formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans, and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter. Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds of cruelty to animals.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are not {{as might}} be {{expected}} always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon called heterosis, hybrid <b>vigour,</b> or heterozygote advantage. This is most common with plant hybrids. A transgressive phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid maize (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.|$|E
5|$|In biology, a hybrid, or crossbreed, is {{the result}} of {{combining}} the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through sexual reproduction. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in blending inheritance), but can show hybrid <b>vigour,</b> often growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In genetics, attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes. In taxonomy, a key question is how closely related the parent species are.|$|E
5|$|Loss {{of hybrid}} <b>vigour</b> occurs and {{phenotype}} varies greatly in subsequent generations if F1 hybrids are inter-bred or backcrossed with animals genetically {{similar to the}} F1 parent. Inter-bred F1 hybrids will produce progeny that can be either heterozygous for each gene variant, homozygous for one gene variant, or homozygous for the other gene variant. When one of the variants has a large effect on a trait, for example the effect of myostatin variants on muscularity, larger phenotypic variation will occur among the progeny. Backcross progeny will have less phenotypic variation and comprise animals that are either heterozygous for each gene variant or homozygous for the variant found in the original F1 backcross parent.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1943, Mackay {{once again}} assumed command of New Guinea Force. This time, {{important}} operations were being {{undertaken in the}} Battle of Finschhafen and Mackay's period of command was marred by disagreements with General Douglas MacArthur's staff over the reinforcement of Finschhafen. Junior commanders felt that Mackay {{should have been more}} forceful, and should have enlisted the help of his superior, Blamey, at an earlier stage. Blamey agreed with them, feeling that his old colleague was slowing down, and no longer possessed the <b>vigour</b> required for the campaign in New Guinea. Mackay left New Guinea in November 1943, handing over command of New Guinea Force to Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead, and on 20 January 1944 Mackay relinquished command of Second Army and New Guinea Force.|$|E
5|$|Sycamore {{trees are}} very {{variable}} across their wide range and have strategies to prevent self-pollination, which is undesirable because it limits the genetic {{variation of the}} progeny and may depress their <b>vigour.</b> Most inflorescences are formed of a mixture of functionally male and functionally female flowers. On any one tree, one or other of these flower types opens first and the other type opens later. Some trees may be male-starters in one year and female-starters in another. The change from one sex to the other may take place on different dates {{in different parts of}} the crown, and different trees in any one population may come into bloom over the course of several weeks, so that cross-pollination is encouraged, although self-pollination may not be completely prevented.|$|E
5|$|The disproportion was {{so great}} at parting, {{that it was almost}} impossible, in Drury Lane, to muster up a {{sufficient}} number to take in all the parts of any play; and of them so few were tolerable, that a play must of necessity be damned, that had not extraordinary favour from the audience. No fewer than sixteen (most of the old standing) went away; and with them the very beauty and <b>vigour</b> of the stage; they who were left being for the most part learners, boys and girls, a very unequal match for them that revolted.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} Demosthenes fought {{at the battle}} of Chaeronea as a hoplite {{indicates}} that he lacked any military skills. According to historian Thomas Babington Macaulay, in his time the division between political and military offices was beginning to be strongly marked. Almost no politician, with the exception of Phocion, was at the same time an apt orator and a competent general. Demosthenes dealt in policies and ideas, and war was not his business. This contrast between Demosthenes's intellectual prowess and his deficiencies in terms of <b>vigour,</b> stamina, military skill and strategic vision is illustrated by the inscription his countrymen engraved on the base of his statue:* C.Carey, Aeschines, 12–14; K. Paparregopoulus, Ab, 396–398.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day the violence continued to spread, and Chinese {{patients in a}} hospital were taken outside and killed. Attempts to extinguish fires in areas devastated the preceding day failed, and the flames increased in <b>vigour,</b> and continued until 12October. Meanwhile, a group of 800 Dutch soldiers and 2,000 natives assaulted Kampung Gading Melati, {{where a group of}} Chinese survivors were holding up under the leadership of Khe Pandjang. Although the Chinese evacuated to nearby Paninggaran, they were later driven out of the area by Dutch forces. There were approximately 450 Dutch and 800 Chinese casualties in the two attacks.|$|E
5|$|The initial <b>vigour</b> and {{excitement}} {{he brought to}} the job began to fade as administration, commuting and office life became tedious. At {{the same time as}} Wilde's interest flagged, the publishers became concerned anew about circulation: sales, at the relatively high price of one shilling, remained low. Increasingly sending instructions to the magazine by letter, he began a new period of creative work and his own column appeared less regularly. In October 1889, Wilde had finally found his voice in prose and, {{at the end of the}} second volume, Wilde left The Woman's World. The magazine outlasted him by one issue.|$|E
5|$|Unlike their Umayyad predecessors, the Abbasid caliphs did {{not pursue}} active expansion: in general terms, they were {{content with the}} {{territorial}} limits achieved, and whatever external campaigns they waged were retaliatory or preemptive, meant to preserve their frontier and impress Abbasid might upon their neighbours. At the same time, the campaigns against Byzantium in particular remained important for domestic consumption. The annual raids, which had almost lapsed in the turmoil following the Abbasid Revolution, were undertaken with renewed <b>vigour</b> from ca. 780 on, and were the only expeditions where the Caliph or his sons participated in person.|$|E
5|$|We earnestly {{recommend}} a longer recess from labour at noon, {{and a more}} early dismission from it in the evening, {{to all those who}} work in the cotton mills: but we deem this indulgence essential to the present health, and future capacity for labour, of those who are under the age of fourteen; for the active recreations of childhood and youth are necessary to the growth, <b>vigour,</b> and the right conformation of the human body. And we cannot excuse ourselves, on the present occasion, from suggesting to you, who are the guardians of the public weal, this further very important consideration, that the rising generation should not be debarred from all opportunities of instruction at the only season of life in which they can be properly improved.|$|E
5|$|While {{teaching}} at the Niedermeyer school Saint-Saëns put less of his energy into composing and performing, but after he left in 1865 he pursued both aspects of his career with <b>vigour.</b> In 1867 his cantata Les noces de Prométhée beat {{more than a hundred}} other entries to win the composition prize of the Grande Fête Internationale in Paris, for which the jury included Auber, Berlioz, Gounod, Rossini and Giuseppe Verdi. In 1868 he premiered the first of his orchestral works to gain a permanent place in the repertoire, his Second Piano Concerto. Playing this and other works he became a noted figure in the musical life of Paris and other cities in France and abroad during the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Calais, factors outside of Edward's control forced him to wind down the war effort. In 1348, the Black Death struck England with full force, killing a third {{or more of the}} country's population. This loss of {{manpower}} led to a shortage of farm labour, and a corresponding rise in wages. The great landowners struggled with the shortage of manpower and the resulting inflation in labour cost. To curb the rise in wages, the king and parliament responded with the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349, followed by the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempts to regulate wages could not succeed in the long run, but in the short term they were enforced with great <b>vigour.</b> All in all, the plague did not lead to a full-scale breakdown of government and society, and recovery was remarkably swift. This was to a large extent thanks to the competent leadership of royal administrators such as Treasurer William Edington and Chief Justice William de Shareshull.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{position}} in Wales was strengthened {{during the first}} two decades of his personal rule. Following the death of Llywelyn the Great in 1240, Henry's power in Wales expanded. Three military campaigns were carried out in the 1240s, new castles were constructed and the royal lands in the County of Chester were expanded, increasing Henry's dominance over the Welsh princes. Dafydd, Llywelyn's son, resisted the incursions, but died in 1246, and Henry confirmed the Treaty of Woodstock the following year with Owain and Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Llywelyn the Great's grandsons, under which they ceded land to the King but retained the heart of their princedom in Gwynedd. In South Wales, Henry gradually extended his authority across the region, but the campaigns were not pursued with <b>vigour</b> and the King did little to stop the Marcher territories along the border becoming increasingly independent of the Crown. In 1256, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd rebelled against Henry and widespread violence spread across Wales; Henry promised a swift military response but did not carry through on his threats.|$|E
5|$|Hieroglyphic texts at Seibal {{indicate}} that the city's newly refound <b>vigour</b> was sponsored by a new alliance formed by the cities of Caracol and Ucanal in the east, two sites that had so far survived the spreading Classic Maya collapse. It is likely that they were attempting to reopen the old Pasión-Usumacinta trade route and were drawn to Seibal by its defensible location overlooking the Pasión River. Seibal's refounding took place in AD 830 with the installation of Wat'ul Chatel as a vassal of Chan Ek' Hopet of Ucanal. The new king dedicated a new building and stelae in 849, overseen by Jewel K'awil of Tikal, and Chan Pet, king of Calakmul. Wat'ul Chatel built an innovative new temple-stelae arrangement {{to the south of}} the Central Plaza of GroupA. StructureA-3 consists of a low radial pyramid with an inventive arrangement of sculpted monuments.|$|E
