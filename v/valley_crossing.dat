5|$|State Route 174 (SR 174) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California. The two-lane 13-mile (21 km) highway, added to the state highway system in 1933, connects Interstate 80 in Colfax with SR 20/SR 49 in Grass <b>Valley,</b> <b>crossing</b> the Bear River next to a 1924 {{concrete}} arch bridge. The majority of the highway is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but local residents have blocked its designation due to property rights concerns.|$|E

It proceeded eastward through the hamlet along Main Street to an interchange with the Southern Tier Expressway (then-NY15 and NY17) just east of the community.

40|$|Idealized {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} thermally driven flows over various valley–plain topographies are performed under daytime conditions. Valley floor inclination and narrowing <b>valley</b> <b>cross</b> sections are systematically varied {{to study the}} influence of along-valley terrain heterogeneity on the developing boundary layer structure, as well as horizontal and vertical transport processes. Valley topographies with inclined valley floors of 0. 86 ° increase upvalley winds {{by a factor of}} about 1. 9 due to smaller valley volumes (volume effect) and by a factor of about 1. 6 due to additional upslope buoyancy forces. Narrowing the <b>valley</b> <b>cross</b> section by 20 km per 100 km along-valley distance increases upvalley winds by a factor of about 2. 6. Vertical mass fluxes out of the valley are strongly increased by a factor between 1. 8 and 2. 8 by narrowing the <b>valley</b> <b>cross</b> sections and by a factor of 1. 2 by inclining the valley floor. Trajectory analysis shows intensified horizontal transport of parcels from the foreland into the valley within the boundary layer in cases with inclined floors and narrowing cross sections due to increased upvalley winds...|$|R
