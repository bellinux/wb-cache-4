5|$|It is <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> to me {{that you}} must remove Sir George Prevost. I see he has gone to war about trifles with the general {{officers}} I sent him, which are certainly the best of their rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will probably with the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.|$|E
5|$|In Northern Europe, Greek mythology {{never took}} the same hold of the visual arts, but its effect was <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> on literature. The English {{imagination}} was fired by Greek mythology starting with Chaucer and John Milton and continuing through Shakespeare to Robert Bridges in the 20th century. Racine in France and Goethe in Germany revived Greek drama, reworking the ancient myths. Although during the Enlightenment of the 18th century reaction against Greek myth spread throughout Europe, the myths continued to provide {{an important source of}} raw material for dramatists, including those who wrote the libretti for many of Handel's and Mozart's operas.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{patterns}} that determine which maqam will be used on a given week. There are some <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> patterns and some not so obvious ones (which are disputed as a result).|$|E
50|$|The species {{adopts a}} range of colours, being host {{pigments}} that protect the coral from ultraviolet radiation. Colonies often occur close to one another, and contact one another. The range of colour morphs of P. versipora is broad {{and so it is}} <b>very</b> often <b>obvious</b> by their colours where one colony begins and another ends.|$|R
50|$|Chalk {{as seen in}} Cretaceous {{deposits}} of Western Europe is unusual among sedimentary limestones in {{the thickness of the}} beds. Most cliffs of chalk have <b>very</b> few <b>obvious</b> bedding planes unlike most thick sequences of limestone such as the Carboniferous Limestone or the Jurassic oolitic limestones. This presumably indicates very stable conditions over tens of millions of years.|$|R
30|$|Consequently, {{although}} there were differences in absolute biomass, biomass allocation patterns on a community-scale among the three desert communities were either the same or <b>very</b> similar, presenting <b>obvious</b> evidence of convergence of desert shrub communities in arid environments.|$|R
25|$|At this stage, {{his work}} was {{considered}} {{to be part of the}} Ibero-American's post-vanguardists Second World War authors according to several scholars. Being under the vanguardist influence, his poetry developed a tone of despair with a <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> revolutionary intent.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{the reign}} of Thutmose III and into the reign of his son, an attempt was made to remove Hatshepsut from certain {{historical}} and pharaonic records. This elimination was carried out in the most literal way possible. Her cartouches and images were chiselled off some stone walls, leaving <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> Hatshepsut-shaped gaps in the artwork.|$|E
25|$|Network Rail {{was formed}} with the {{principal}} purpose of acquiring and owning Railtrack plc. Originally the Government allowed private companies to bid for Railtrack plc. However, with limited availability of financial data on Railtrack, {{the political implications of}} owning the company and the <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> preference of the government that the national railway network should go to Network Rail, no bidders apart from Network Rail were forthcoming, and Network Rail bought Railtrack plc on 3 October 2002. Railtrack plc was subsequently renamed to Network Rail Infrastructure Limited.|$|E
60|$|It was all <b>very</b> {{clear and}} <b>obvious,</b> {{and it seemed}} to me that to-morrow's trial should be very interesting. I had but to deny; I had but to make myself the {{mouthpiece}} of the rumour that was abroad, and Heaven alone could foretell what the consequences might be.|$|R
5|$|There is <b>very</b> little <b>obvious</b> {{landscape}} evidence remaining of {{the previous}} mining activities around Clutton, Temple Cloud, High Littleton and Timsbury. However {{there is a very}} large Batch almost in the middle of Camerton that is now a designated Local Nature Reserve. The Batch was bare, like the Paulton ones until, according to locals, the wife of the owner of Camerton Court decided to pay for it to be planted with trees to improve the view. There are small batches at Clutton, east of Radford Hill and at Greyfields, High Littleton.|$|R
40|$|There are now {{dozens of}} books and {{hundreds}} of articles available {{on the topic of}} organizational spirituality (OS). When one engages with this literature, it <b>very</b> quickly becomes <b>obvious</b> that there is no concensus either on what 2 ̆ 7 spirituality 2 ̆ 7 means or on what the term 2 ̆ 7 organizational spirituality 2 ̆ 7 means. [Extract...|$|R
25|$|A second {{distinguishing}} {{feature of this}} new era was that flat lead roofs now often replaced the former attics where the servants had slept. However, this lack of space was compensated in the new houses by the entire ground floor being given over to the servants. This floor, usually built of rusticated stone, was beneath the larger and grander piano nobile occupied by the employers. Ornate external staircases were built {{to the front door}} which was now clearly on the first floor. The nobility now had <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> minimal contact with those living downstairs.|$|E
25|$|This {{novel is}} notable for its overt use of coincidence, such as Mrs Oliver {{going into a}} café that happens to contain the girl she is seeking, and having a key piece of {{evidence}} literally fall into her hands from a drawer as furniture is being removed from a dead woman's flat. This <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> use of coincidence is known as open authorial manipulation and {{is often used to}} draw the reader's attention to the artificiality of the plot. It is highly appropriate to a detective novel in which a central character writes detective fiction and is an example of metafiction.|$|E
25|$|The Askeri İnzibat {{military}} police {{is a small}} force that is under military command that handles cases directly relevant to military security and military crimes. Their area of jurisdiction is generally limited to military bases. But they also track down military criminals (draft dodgers and deserters). Some of the other duties they perform are, protection and VIP detail provided to important bases or commanders, control of traffic inside the bases and providing security in military courts. They can be identified using the <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> “AS. İZ.”, printed in large letters {{across the front of}} their helmets.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{definition}} indicates, the Canadian and American concepts of {{fair market value}} are <b>very</b> similar. One <b>obvious</b> {{difference is that the}} Canadian working definition refers to [...] "the highest price" [...] whereas the American definition merely mentions [...] "the price." [...] It is debatable whether or not the presence of the word [...] "highest" [...] distinguishes the Canadian from the American definition.|$|R
5000|$|British {{ambition}} for chetniks' engagement was in {{the acts}} of sabotage and undermining German war efforts. The strategy meant {{that they would be}} supplied with explosives, medical equipment and similar, while they were asking for light-machine guns and ammunition, boots, uniforms and wireless accessories. [...] The discrepancy of intentions between two allied armies became <b>obvious</b> <b>very</b> early in the engagement and grew ever-wider.|$|R
5000|$|The armet {{is found}} in many {{contemporary}} pieces of artwork, such as Paolo Uccello's [...] "Battle of San Romano," [...] and is almost always shown {{as part of a}} Milanese armor. These depictions show armets worn with tall and elaborate crests, largely of feathered plumes; however, no surviving armets have similar crests and <b>very</b> few show <b>obvious</b> provision for the attachment of such crests.|$|R
25|$|The behavioral-based {{approach}} to detecting rootkits attempts to infer {{the presence of}} a rootkit by looking for rootkit-like behavior. For example, by profiling a system, differences in the timing and frequency of API calls or in overall CPU utilization can be attributed to a rootkit. The method is complex and is hampered by a high incidence of false positives. Defective rootkits can sometimes introduce <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> changes to a system: the Alureon rootkit crashed Windows systems after a security update exposed a design flaw in its code. Logs from a packet analyzer, firewall, or intrusion prevention system may present evidence of rootkit behaviour in a networked environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{depiction}} of prophets, apostles, saints, patriarchs {{and other people}} associated with the church often {{have a place in}} the decorative scheme. The thematic use of such figures may be a <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> one. There may, for example, be a row of stained glass windows showing the prophets that predicted the coming of the Messiah. Or within a carved stone screen might stand statues of those monarchs who were particularly devoted to the church. The apostles, usually twelve in number but sometimes accompanied by St Paul, John the Baptist, Mary Magdalene and others, are a frequent subject. The upright, standing figures particularly lent themselves to architectural decoration and they often appear in a columnar form around doorways or in tiers on the façades of cathedrals.|$|E
25|$|Censorship was {{reinstated}} on March 12, 1916, {{after the}} declaration of war by Germany. Seizures were ordered of all documents whose publication might hinder national security or could be perceived as anti-war propaganda. Prior censorship, now a task of the Department of War, was always seen as a temporary exception, being unconstitutional. The military coup by Sidónio Pais would be in part justified with the unpopularity of prior censorship, which was now <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> in the newspapers, as the space occupied by the censored text was intentionally left blank, so as to indicate to readers that the text had been censored. Sidónio Pais would, however, resort to prior censorship, adding it to all other repressive actions by his government {{until the end of}} the War.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1930s. MGM starred Joan Crawford, Nils Asther and Robert Montgomery {{in a film}} called [...] "Letty Lynton", {{which was based on}} a 1931 novel of the same title by Marie Adelaide Belloc Lowndes. This film {{followed}} very closely along Madeleine's story. In the film version, however, Crawford's character is never charged with murder, and, in a classic example of pre-code Hollywood, gets away with murder (though the murder is accidental). Unfortunately, Letty is only available as a bootleg (illegally) due to a copyright suit filed shortly after the film's release in 1932. For those that have seen it, the parallels are <b>very</b> much <b>obvious</b> and it remains a highly sought after piece of history.|$|R
2500|$|In 2005, Hamas won {{in nearly}} all the {{municipalities}} it contested. Political analyst Salah Abdel-Shafi told the BBC about the difficulties of Fatah leadership: [...] "I think it's very, <b>very</b> seriousit's becoming <b>obvious</b> that they can't agree on anything." [...] Fatah is [...] "widely seen as being {{in desperate need of}} reform," [...] as [...] "the PA's performance has been a story of corruption and incompetenceand Fatah has been tainted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My good man," [...] she said, [...] "whatever you do don't try and be sentimental. You {{know quite}} well that I have {{never in my}} life pretended to care a rap about you--except to pass the time. You are {{altogether}} too <b>obvious.</b> <b>Very</b> young girls and very old women would rave about you. You simply don't appeal to me. Perhaps I know you too well. What does it matter!" ...|$|R
25|$|On Philadelphia's next drive, {{the referees}} made two suspect decisions. The {{first was a}} non-call on a <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> {{facemask}} on Brian Westbrook {{that would have given}} the Eagles a first down. The next call in question was a 40-yard passing interference penalty on Anthony Henry. Replays showed that it was Greg Lewis who grabbed Henry's jersey and pulled him down, not the other way around. With that decision, the Eagles were awarded a first down on the 1-yard line. Westbrook immediately ran it in for a 1-yard TD. On their next possession, Akers' hit a 22-yard field goal. To make the game the highest scoring half ever on MNF, the Cowboys ended the half with kicker Nick Folk getting a 51-yard field goal, bringing the total points for both teams to 54.|$|E
25|$|Even {{the most}} festive parades usually offer some aspect {{dedicated}} to remembering victims of AIDS and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and corporate sponsors, and promoted as major tourist attractions for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere {{in a nearby}} park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade {{can be hard to}} establish in some events, however in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes <b>very</b> <b>obvious.</b> There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.|$|E
25|$|A {{player who}} makes an illegal move loses immediately. (This rule may be relaxed in casual games, and Hodges writing for a Western {{audience}} encourages players to do so.) Players can also {{agree to a}} draw at any time, or if the game reaches a position such that the winning condition is impossible to fulfill for either player (called 持将棋 jishōgi, as in standard shogi). (In practice, positions that cannot be won without the other side making a <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> blunder are also considered as jishōgi, such as a king with only his lion blocked from getting near the enemy king by two side movers on adjacent ranks.) Under the historical rules, this means that no legal series of moves can lead to all of one player's royal pieces being captured; under the Japanese Chu Shogi Association's rules, this additionally means that no legal series of moves can lead to one player being left with only a king, or with no royal pieces. In professional play, drawn games are replayed with opposite colours.|$|E

5000|$|Eugeissona is a {{clustering}} genus {{of flowering}} {{plant in the}} palm family native to Borneo, Thailand and Malaysia. The six monoecious species provide {{a wide range of}} local uses and are commonly called bertam or wild Bornean sago. The genus is the sole representative of the Eugeissoninae having <b>very</b> few <b>obvious</b> relatives; the hermaphrodite and staminate flowers are also found in Metroxylon, however the other specialized characteristics are unique suggesting an early split and differentiation from other members of the Calameae. Fossilized pollen belonging to these plants has been recovered in the lower and middle Miocene deposits in Sarawak. [...] The name is from two Greek words meaning [...] "good" [...] and [...] "roof", due to their common use in roof thatching.|$|R
60|$|In {{regard to}} the anecdotes and {{narratives}} which are very freely introduced to illustrate principles in this work, the writer ought to state, that though they are all substantially true, that is, all except those which are expressly introduced as mere suppositions, he has not hesitated to alter <b>very</b> freely, for <b>obvious</b> reasons, the unimportant circumstances connected with them. He has endeavored thus to destroy {{the personality of the}} narratives, without injuring or altering their moral effect.|$|R
25|$|This Bible, {{as indeed}} all the picture Bibles of the Middle Ages, {{did not contain}} {{the full text of}} the Bible, and {{contained}} much original commentary. Short passages only were cited, and these not so as to give any continuous sense or line of thought. But the object of the writer seems to have been chiefly to make the texts cited the basis of moral and allegorical teaching, in the manner so common in those days. In the Psalter he was content with copying out the first verse of each psalm; whilst when dealing with the Gospels he did not quote from each evangelist separately, but made use of a kind of confused diatessaron of all four combined. An attempt was made to establish a connection between the events recorded in the Old Testament and those recorded in the New, even when there {{does not seem to be}} any <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> connection between them. Thus the sleep of Adam, recorded in the beginning of Genesis, is said to prefigure the death of Christ; and Abraham sending his servant with rich presents to seek a wife for his son is a type of the Eternal Father giving the Gospels to the Apostles to prepare the union of His Son with the Church.|$|E
500|$|The {{problem was}} <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> to {{residents}} of the town. During the press conference announcing the class-action lawsuit, a resident suggested that some residents had placed [...] "bets" [...] on when the building would collapse. Ontario's Ministry of Labour visited the mall six times {{in the three years}} before the collapse.|$|E
500|$|Theta rhythmicity is <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> in {{rabbits and}} rodents and also clearly present in cats and dogs. [...] Whether theta {{can be seen}} in {{primates}} is not yet clear. [...] In rats (the animals that have been the most extensively studied), theta is seen mainly in two conditions: [...] first, when an animal is walking or in some other way actively interacting with its surroundings; second, during REM sleep.|$|E
30|$|The more {{a method}} aims to create {{scientific}} {{knowledge about the}} future by reducing its uncertainty, the more it must fail for a <b>very</b> simple and <b>obvious</b> reason: The future is uncertain and we cannot know the future. The knowledge paradox is reinforced by strong individual and group interests in knowledge creation among scientists (that includes would-be knowledge about the future to reduce its uncertainty) and among recipients (to reduce insecurity of strategic planning and decision-making).|$|R
60|$|The cause is, indeed, so <b>very</b> {{plain and}} <b>obvious</b> that the wonder {{is the other}} way. When a {{properly}} directed inquiry is made, the gentlemen who are amazed {{at the price of}} these commodities will find, that, when hay is at six pound a load, as they must know it is, herbage, and for more than one year, must be scanty; and they will conclude, that, if grass be scarce, beef, veal, mutton, butter, milk, and cheese must be dear.|$|R
40|$|Continuing {{our search}} for {{biogenic}} NF-ÎºB inhibitors we investigated Solanum diflorum, used by the Istmo Sierra Zapotec Indians of Mexico {{in the treatment of}} inflammatory skin conditions. It became <b>obvious</b> <b>very</b> early that the active substance seems to be a degradation product of chlorophyll. Pheophorbide A was identified as one of the key compounds responsible for the NF-ÎºB inhibitory activity. The compound interferes with NF-ÎºB activation, was cytotoxic if exposed to light, but devoid of any cytotoxic activity in the dark...|$|R
