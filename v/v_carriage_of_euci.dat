40|$|During {{a two-year}} period from January 1979, 260 {{patients}} {{have been involved in}} an outbreak <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> and infection due to gentamicin-resistant enterobacteria. We have examined the duration <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> such enterobacteria and have compared the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> Klebsiella with that of other resistant enterobacteria. <b>Carriage</b> <b>of</b> gentamicin-resistant enterobacteria occurred most frequently and was least sporadic in the intestinal tract. Vaginal carriage was observed in 49 out of 68 patients tested and occurred more frequently in older patients. Oral carriage was noted in 36 % of patients but was more sporadic than intestinal <b>carriage.</b> Rates <b>of</b> oral <b>carriage</b> were greater among moribund patients.
