25|$|In contrast, high Reynolds numbers (Re>>1) {{indicate}} that the inertial effects have more effect on the <b>velocity</b> <b>field</b> than the viscous (friction) effects. In high Reynolds number flows, the flow is often modeled as an inviscid flow, an approximation in which viscosity is completely neglected. Eliminating viscosity allows the Navier–Stokes equations to be simplified into the Euler equations. The integration of the Euler equations along a streamline in an inviscid flow yields Bernoulli's equation. When, {{in addition to being}} inviscid, the flow is irrotational everywhere, Bernoulli's equation can completely describe the flow everywhere. Such flows are called potential flows, because the <b>velocity</b> <b>field</b> may be expressed as the gradient of a potential energy expression.|$|E

40|$|In {{the hybrid}} {{approach}} of large-eddy simulation (LES) and Lighthill's acoustic analogy for turbulence-generated sound, the turbulence source fields are obtained using an LES and the turbulence-generated sound at far fields is calculated from Lighthill's acoustic analogy. As only the <b>velocity</b> <b>fields</b> at resolved scales {{are available from}} the LES, the Lighthill stress tensor, serving as a source term in Lighthill's acoustic equation, has to be evaluated from the resolved <b>velocity</b> <b>fields.</b> As a result, the contribution from the unresolved <b>velocity</b> <b>fields</b> is missing in the conventional LES. The sound of missing scales is shown to be important and hence needs to be modeled. The present study proposes a kinematic subgrid-scale (SGS) model which recasts the unresolved <b>velocity</b> <b>fields</b> into Lighthill's stress tensors. A kinematic simulation is used to construct the unresolved <b>velocity</b> <b>fields</b> with the imposed temporal statistics, which is consistent with the random sweeping hypothesis. The kinematic SGS model is used to calculate sound power spectra from isotropic turbulence and yields an improved result: the missing portion of the sound power spectra is approximately recovered in the LE...|$|R

25|$|The {{solution}} of the Navier–Stokes equations is a flow velocity. It is a field, since it is defined at every point in a region of space and an interval of time. Once the <b>velocity</b> <b>field</b> is calculated other quantities of interest, such as pressure or temperature, may be found using additional equations and relations. This is different from what one normally sees in classical mechanics, where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a particle or deflection of a continuum. Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid; however for visualization purposes one can compute various trajectories.|$|E

25|$|Once the tangent {{spaces of}} a {{manifold}} have been introduced, one can define vector fields, which are abstractions of the <b>velocity</b> <b>field</b> of particles moving in space. A vector field attaches to every {{point of the}} manifold a vector from the tangent space at that point, in a smooth manner. Such a vector field serves to define a generalized ordinary differential equation on a manifold: A solution to such a differential equation is a differentiable curve on the manifold whose derivative at any point {{is equal to the}} tangent vector attached to that point by the vector field.|$|E
25|$|Detached eddy {{simulations}} (DES) is {{a modification}} of a RANS model in which the model switches to a subgrid scale formulation in regions fine enough for LES calculations. Regions near solid boundaries and where the turbulent length scale {{is less than the}} maximum grid dimension are assigned the RANS mode of solution. As the turbulent length scale exceeds the grid dimension, the regions are solved using the LES mode. Therefore, the grid resolution for DES is not as demanding as pure LES, thereby considerably cutting down the cost of the computation. Though DES was initially formulated for the Spalart-Allmaras model (Spalart et al., 1997), it can be implemented with other RANS models (Strelets, 2001), by appropriately modifying the length scale which is explicitly or implicitly involved in the RANS model. So while Spalart–Allmaras model based DES acts as LES with a wall model, DES based on other models (like two equation models) behave as a hybrid RANS-LES model. Grid generation is more complicated than for a simple RANS or LES case due to the RANS-LES switch. DES is a non-zonal approach and provides a single smooth <b>velocity</b> <b>field</b> across the RANS and the LES regions of the solutions.|$|E

40|$|The Hα <b>velocity</b> <b>fields</b> of {{a sample}} of six {{luminous}} blue compact galaxies (BCGs) and two companions have been obtained by observations with a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer. The Fabry-Perot images, <b>velocity</b> <b>fields</b> and rotations curves have been presented in a previous paper (Paper I). In general, the <b>velocity</b> <b>fields</b> are irregular and often contain secondary dynamical components, but display overall rotation. The two companions have more regular <b>velocity</b> <b>fields</b> and rotation curves. In this article we analyse the <b>velocity</b> <b>fields</b> and dynamics together with the morphology of the studied BCGs, and present detailed mass models. In addition, we model the stellar mass content by means of multicolour surface photometry and spectral evolutionary synthesis analysis. By comparison of the masses of stars and those derived from the rotation curve, we show {{that about half of}} the galaxies cannot be supported by rotation alone. The morphology and dynamics of the BCGs suggest that the starburst activity in these galaxies are most likely triggered by mergers involving gas-rich dwarf galaxies and/or massive gas clouds.
