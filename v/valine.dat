Loss of glutamate transporter gene expression (especially EAAT 2) {{has been attributed to}} acute liver failure. Benzodiazepine-like compounds have been detected at increased levels as well as abnormalities in the GABA neurotransmission system. An imbalance between aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine) and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and <b>valine)</b> has been described; this would lead to the generation of false neurotransmitters (such octopamine and 2-hydroxyphenethylamine). Dysregulation of the serotonin system, too, has been reported. Depletion of zinc and accumulation of manganese may play a role. Inflammation elsewhere in the body may precipitate encephalopathy through the action of cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide on astrocytes.|$|E

25|$|The {{branched-chain}} {{fatty acid}} synthesizing system uses α-keto acids as primers. This system {{is distinct from}} the branched-chain fatty acid synthetase that utilizes short-chain acyl-CoA esters as primers. α-Keto acid primers are derived from the transamination and decarboxylation of <b>valine,</b> leucine, and isoleucine to form 2-methylpropanyl-CoA, 3-methylbutyryl-CoA, and 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively. 2-Methylpropanyl-CoA primers derived from <b>valine</b> are elongated to produce even-numbered iso-series fatty acids such as 14-methyl-pentadecanoic (isopalmitic) acid, and 3-methylbutyryl-CoA primers from leucine {{may be used to}} form odd-numbered iso-series fatty acids such as 13-methyl-tetradecanoic acid. 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA primers from isoleucine are elongated to form anteiso-series fatty acids containing an odd number of carbon atoms such as 12-Methyl tetradecanoic acid. Decarboxylation of the primer precursors occurs through the branched-chain α-keto acid decarboxylase (BCKA) enzyme. Elongation of the fatty acid follows the same biosynthetic pathway in Escherichia coli used to produce straight-chain fatty acids where malonyl-CoA is used as a chain extender. The major end products are 12–17 carbon branched-chain fatty acids and their composition tends to be uniform and characteristic for many bacterial species.|$|E
25|$|Honey bees obtain all {{of their}} {{nutritional}} requirements from a diverse combination of pollen and nectar. Pollen is the only natural protein source for honey bees. Adult worker honey bees consume 3.4-4.3mg of pollen per day to meet a dry matter requirement of 66-74% protein. The rearing of one larva requires 125-187.5mg pollen or 25-37.5mg protein for proper development. Dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids, ten of which are considered essential to honey bees: methionine, tryptophan, arginine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, threonine, leucine, and <b>valine.</b> Of these amino acids, honey bees require highest concentrations of leucine, isoleucine, and <b>valine,</b> however elevated concentrations of arginine and lysine are required for brood rearing. In addition to these amino acids, some B vitamins including biotin, folic acid, nicotinamide, riboflavin, thiamine, pantothenate, and most importantly, pyridoxine are required to rear larvae. Pyridoxine is the most prevalent B vitamin found in royal jelly and concentrations vary throughout the foraging season with lowest concentrations found in May and highest concentrations found in July and August. Honey bees lacking dietary pyridoxine were unable to rear brood.|$|E

Endogenous ethylene oxide, just as like environmental (exogenous) one, can alkylate guanine in DNA, forming an adduct 7-(2-hydroxyethyl)-guanine, and this poses an intrinsic carcinogenic risk.

However, it was not possible to separate clearly the effect of smoking from that of ethylene oxide exposure. No increase in the frequencies of micronuclei in lymphocytes and buccal cells was found. The level of 2 -hydroxyethyl adducts to the N-terminal <b>valines</b> in hemoglobin responded in a reliable fashion to chronic ethylene oxide exposure and smoking.

40|$|An {{effort to}} combine {{theoretical}} analyses and protein engineering methods {{has been made}} to probe the folding mechanism of SH 3 by using Energy Landscape Theory and a φ-value analysis. Particular emphasis was given to core residues and the effect of desolvation during the folding event by replacing the core <b>valines</b> with isosteric threonines. These mutations have the advantage of keeping the core structurally invariant while affecting core stability relative to the unfolded state. Although the <b>valines</b> that form the core appear spatially invariant, the folding kinetics of their threonine mutants varies, indicating their different extent of solvation in the transition-state ensemble. Theoretical studies predicted the distribution of folding kinetics of threonine mutants without previous knowledge of the measured rates.

25|$|The BCKA decarboxylase enzyme is {{composed}} of two subunits in a tetrameric structure (A2B2) and {{is essential for the}} synthesis of branched-chain fatty acids. It is responsible for the decarboxylation of α-keto acids formed by the transamination of <b>valine,</b> leucine, and isoleucine and produces the primers used for branched-chain fatty acid synthesis. The activity of this enzyme is much higher with branched-chain α-keto acid substrates than with straight-chain substrates, and in Bacillus species its specificity is highest for the isoleucine-derived α-keto-β-methylvaleric acid, followed by α-ketoisocaproate and α-ketoisovalerate. The enzyme’s high affinity toward branched-chain α-keto acids allows it to function as the primer donating system for branched-chain fatty acid synthetase.|$|E

To produce capsaicin, 8-methyl-6-nonenoyl-CoA is produced by the branched-chain fatty acid pathway and condensed with vanillamine. Other capsaicinoids are produced by the condensation of vanillamine with various acyl-CoA products from the branched-chain fatty acid pathway, which is capable of producing a variety of acyl-CoA moieties of different chain length and degrees of unsaturation.

25|$|The general biosynthetic pathway of {{capsaicin}} {{and other}} capsaicinoids was elucidated in the 1960s by Bennett and Kirby, and Leete and Louden.

Enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) and their function in capsaicinoid biosynthesis were identified later by Fujiwake et al., and Sukrasno and Yeoman. Suzuki et al. {{are responsible for}} identifying leucine as another precursor to the branched-chain fatty acid pathway. It was discovered in 1999 that pungency of chili peppers is related to higher transcription levels of key enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase. Similar studies showed high transcription levels in the placenta of chili peppers with high pungency of genes responsible for branched-chain fatty acid pathway.|$|E
25|$|The {{hemolymph}} toxins {{originate from}} autogenous de novo biosynthesis by the Chrysomelina beetle. Essential amino acids as <b>valine</b> serve as precursors {{for the production}} of the hemolymph toxins of Chrysomelina leaf beetles. The degradation of such essential amino acids provides propanoyl-CoA. This compound is further transformed into propanoic acid and β-alanine. The amino group in β-alanine is then oxidized to yield either an oxime or the nitro-toxin 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA). The oxime is cyclized to isoxazolin-5-one, which is transformed with α-UDP-glucose into the isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. In a final step, an ester is formed by transesterification of 3-nitropropanoyl-CoA to the 6´-position of isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. This biosynthetic route yields high millimolar concentrations of the secondary isoxazolin-5-one and 3-NPA derived metabolites. Free 3-NPA and glucosides that derive from 3-NPA and isoxazolin-5-one also occur in many genera of leguminous plants (Fabaceae).|$|E

25|$|Ingested {{proteins}} {{are usually}} broken up into single amino acids or dipeptides {{in the small}} intestine, and then absorbed. They can then be joined to make new proteins. Intermediate products of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway {{can be used to}} make all twenty amino acids, and most bacteria and plants possess all the necessary enzymes to synthesize them. Humans and other mammals, however, can synthesize only half of them. They cannot synthesize isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and <b>valine.</b> These are the essential amino acids, since it is essential to ingest them. Mammals do possess the enzymes to synthesize alanine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, and tyrosine, the nonessential amino acids.

25|$|It was {{reported}} in 2004 that excess racemic D,L-asparagine (Asn), which spontaneously forms crystals of either isomer during recrystallization, induces asymmetric resolution of a co-existing racemic amino acid such as arginine (Arg), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamine (Gln), histidine (His), leucine (Leu), methionine (Met), phenylalanine (Phe), serine (Ser), <b>valine</b> (Val), tyrosine (Tyr), and tryptophan (Trp). The enantiomeric excess {ee=100x(L-D)/(L+D)} of these amino acids was correlated almost linearly {{with that of the}} inducer, i.e., Asn. When recrystallizations from a mixture of 12 D,L-amino acids (Ala, Asp, Arg, Glu, Gln, His, Leu, Met, Ser, Val, Phe, and Tyr) and excess D,L-Asn were made, all amino acids with the same configuration with Asn were preferentially co-crystallized. It was incidental whether the enrichment took place in L- or D-Asn, however, once the selection was made, the co-existing amino acid with the same configuration at the α-carbon was preferentially involved because of thermodynamic stability in the crystal formation. The maximal ee {{was reported}} to be 100%. Based on these results, it is proposed that a mixture of racemic amino acids causes spontaneous and effective optical resolution, even if asymmetric synthesis of a single amino acid does not occur without an aid of an optically active molecule.|$|E
25|$|Potassium ion {{channels}} {{remove the}} hydration shell from the ion when {{it enters the}} selectivity filter. The selectivity filter is formed by a five residue sequence, TVGYG, termed the signature sequence, {{within each of the}} four subunits. This signature sequence is within a loop between the pore helix and TM2/6, historically termed the P-loop. This signature sequence is highly conserved, with the exception that a <b>valine</b> residue in prokaryotic potassium channels is often substituted with an isoleucine residue in eukaryotic channels. This sequence adopts a unique main chain structure, structurally analogous to a nest protein structural motif. The four sets of electronegative carbonyl oxygen atoms are aligned {{toward the center of the}} filter pore and form a square anti-prism similar to a water-solvating shell around each potassium binding site. The distance between the carbonyl oxygens and potassium ions in the binding sites of the selectivity filter is the same as between water oxygens in the first hydration shell and a potassium ion in water solution, providing an energetically-favorable route for de-solvation of the ions. This width appears to be maintained by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces within a sheet of aromatic amino acid residues surrounding the selectivity filter. The selectivity filter opens towards the extracellular solution, exposing four carbonyl oxygens in a glycine residue (Gly79 in KcsA). The next residue toward the extracellular side of the protein is the negatively charged Asp80 (KcsA). This residue together with the five filter residues form the pore that connects the water-filled cavity in the center of the protein with the extracellular solution.|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{modification}} can inhibit ion channels {{either by}} reacting with pore-lining residues and directly occluding the channel or by closing the channel allosterically. A general method {{to distinguish between}} these two mechanisms does not exist. Previously, sulfhydryl (SH) modification {{has been shown to}} inhibit ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. The crucial modification has been localized to C 42 near the N-terminus of Kir 6. 2, a pore-forming subunit of KATP channels, but little is known about how SH modification of C 42 causes channel inhibition. To investigate this mechanism, we used the membrane-impermeable methanethiosulfonates, MTSET and MTS-TEAH, to modify Kir 6. 2 channels. While intracellular application of MTSET irreversibly inhibited channels, MTS-TEAH failed to do so. Instead, MTS-TEAH treatment prolonged channel openings and prevented the effect of subsequent MTSET treatment. Similar observations were made in mutants in which cysteines other than C 42 had been mutated. Neither MTSET nor MTS-TEAH, however, affected mutant channels in which <b>valines</b> were substituted for C 42 residues in all subunits. The reagents were effective when two of four C 42 residues in the tetramer were replaced by <b>valines.</b> These results can be interpreted as indicating that both reagents modify C 42. We then employed spermine, a known inner pore blocker, as a probe to examine whether MTS-TEAH modification alters pore accessibility. We found that spermine block was not changed by MTS-TEAH modification. Based on these data, we postulate that C 42 faces either the cytoplasm or a vestibule section wide enough to allow spermine to pass freely after modification by MTS-TEAH. Our study suggests that channel inhibition caused by SH modification of Kir 6. 2 is an allosteric effect, and is not caused by direct pore blockage...|$|R
