5000|$|DSL modems {{transfer}} data {{at a rate}} {{which is}} at least 10 to 20 times that of a <b>voice-band</b> <b>modem.</b>|$|E
50|$|A DSL modem modulates {{high-frequency}} tones for transmission to {{a digital}} subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM), and receives and demodulates them from the DSLAM. It serves fundamentally the same purpose as the <b>voice-band</b> <b>modem</b> that was a mainstay in the late 20th century, but differs from it in important ways.|$|E
5000|$|DSL {{does not}} {{interfere}} with normal telephone calls on the telephone line, and does not require dialing a telephone number to initiate a connection, it is always [...] "on". A <b>voice-band</b> <b>modem</b> dials a telephone number to initiate a connection, {{and while it is}} connected the telephone line cannot be used for normal telephone service.|$|E
5000|$|DSL modems vary in data speed from {{hundreds}} of kilobits per second to many megabits, while <b>voice-band</b> <b>modems</b> are nominally 56K modems and actually limited to approximately 50 kbit/s.|$|R
5000|$|DSL modems {{exchange}} {{data with}} only the DSLAM {{to which they are}} wired, which in turn connects them to the Internet, while most <b>voice-band</b> <b>modems</b> can dial directly anywhere in the world.|$|R
5000|$|DSL modems are {{intended}} for particular protocols and sometimes won't work on another line even from the same company, while most <b>voice-band</b> <b>modems</b> use international standards and can [...] "fall back" [...] to find a standard that will work.|$|R
50|$|Professor Pahlavan {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as one of the pioneering visionary researchers of Wi-Fi Technology and wireless Indoor-Geolocation. Since 2009 he has extended his research in wireless access and localization in to the body area networking. He has contributed to numerous seminal technical and visionary publications and patents in <b>voice-band</b> <b>modem,</b> wireless LANs, wireless heterogeneous networks, wireless indoor Geolocation, Wi-Fi Positioning Systems and localization for capsule endoscopy applications. He is author of several pioneering books in the area of wireless networks.|$|E
5000|$|DSL modems use {{frequencies}} from 25 kHz {{to above}} 1 MHz (see Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line), {{in order not}} to interfere with voice service which is primarily 0-4 kHz. Voice-band modems use the same frequency spectrum as ordinary telephones, and will interfere with voice service - it is usually impossible to make a telephone call on a line which is being used by a <b>voice-band</b> <b>modem.</b> Because a single phone line commonly carries DSL and voice, DSL filters are used to separate the two uses.|$|E
50|$|The USART's {{synchronous}} capabilities {{were primarily}} intended to support synchronous protocols like IBM's Synchronous transmit-receive (STR), Binary Synchronous Communications (BSC), Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC), and the ISO-standard High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) synchronous link-layer protocols, which were used with synchronous voice-frequency modems. These protocols {{were designed to}} make the best use of bandwidth when modems were analog devices. In those times, the fastest asynchronous <b>voice-band</b> <b>modem</b> could achieve at most speeds of 300 bit/s using frequency-shift keying modulation, while synchronous modems could run at speeds up to 9600 bit/s using phase-shift keying. Synchronous transmission used only slightly over 80% of the bandwidth of the now more-familiar asynchronous transmission, since start and stop bits were unnecessary. Those modems are obsolete, having been replaced by modems which convert asynchronous data to synchronous forms, but similar synchronous telecommunications protocols survive in numerous block-oriented technologies such as the widely used IEEE 802.2 (Ethernet) link-level protocol. USARTs are still sometimes integrated with MCUs. USARTs are still used in routers that connect to external CSU/DSU devices, and they often use either Cisco's proprietary HDLC implementation or the IETF standard Point-to-Point Protocol in HDLC-like framing as defined in RFC 1662.|$|E
5000|$|For {{internal}} DSL modems, Microsoft Windows {{and other}} operating systems provide interfaces {{similar to those}} provided for <b>voice-band</b> <b>modems.</b> This {{is based on the}} assumption that in the future, as CPU speeds increase, internal DSL modems may become more mainstream.|$|R
50|$|Like {{traditional}} <b>voice-band</b> <b>modems,</b> a DSLAM's integrated DSL modems {{are usually}} able {{to probe the}} line and to adjust themselves to electronically or digitally compensate for forward echoes and other bandwidth-limiting factors {{in order to move}} data at the maximum possible connection rate.|$|R
5000|$|... 1982: Trellis-coded {{modulation}}Trellis-coded modulation (TCM) {{is first}} used in <b>voice-band</b> <b>modems</b> to send data {{at higher rates}} over telephone channels. Today, TCM is applied in a large variety of terrestrial and satellite-based transmission systems as a key technique for achieving faster and more reliable digital transmission.|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{real-time}} streaming applications scheduling on hybrid CPU/FPGA architectures. The main contribution is a two-step approach to minimize the buffer requirement for streaming applications with throughput guarantees. A novel declarative way of constraint based scheduling for real-time hybrid SW/HW systems is proposed, while the application throughput is guaranteed by periodic phases in execution. We use a <b>voice-band</b> <b>modem</b> application to exemplify the scheduling capabilities of our method. The experimental results show the advantages of our techniques in both less buffer requirement and higher throughput guarantees compared to the traditional PAPS method...|$|E
40|$|Scrambler is {{generally}} employed in data communication systems to add redundancy in the transmitted data stream {{so that at}} the receiver end, timing information can be retrieved to aid the synchronization between data terminals. Present paper deals with simulation {{and implementation of the}} scrambler for 56 Kbps <b>voice-band</b> <b>modem.</b> Scrambler for the transmitter of 56 Kbps modem was chosen as a case study. Simulation has been carried out using Simulink of Matlab. An algorithm for the scrambling function has been developed and implemented on Texas Instrument’s based TMS 320 C 50 PQ 57 Digital Signal Processor (DSP). Signalogic DSP software has been used to compare the simulated and practical results...|$|E
40|$|With {{the growth}} of Internet, demand for high bit rate Internet access is growing. Even though DSL offers the {{possibility}} of very high rate Internet access, the V. 90 modems are still the most used method to access Internet from homes. In this paper, we provide {{a brief review of}} the <b>voice-band</b> <b>modem</b> technology. We discuss the Internet access model that made V. 90 possible. We also provide ways how V. 90 like technologies (which we call advanced PCM technology) can be used to increase the bit rates beyond 56 kbps. However, with the advent of DSL and other technologies for broadband Internet access, it is unlikely that these advanced PCM technologies may find use in practice. Finally we provide a brief description what made broadband access feasible on twisted copper wires. 1...|$|E
5000|$|DSL routers, {{the most}} common form of DSL modem, are {{external}} to the computer and wired to the computer's Ethernet port or its USB port, whereas <b>voice-band</b> <b>modems</b> are usually internal devices installed in the computer itself in a PCI interface slot in the back. Internal DSL modems are rare but available.|$|R
50|$|Historically, <b>voice-band</b> {{synchronous}} <b>modems</b> {{such as the}} Bell 201, 208, and 209 and the CCITT V.26, V.27, V.29, V.32, and V.34 used PSK.|$|R
5000|$|Microsoft Windows {{and other}} {{operating}} systems regard <b>voice-band</b> <b>modems</b> {{as part of}} the hardware of the computer, and similarly {{to other parts of the}} computer's hardware such as the mouse or hard disk are configured through the Windows Control Panel. In contrast, DSL routers are regarded as separate nodes in the LAN (local area network). DSL modems rarely require manual configuration or attention, but when they do they can be accessed using the internet browser. Routers usually have a webpage, accessed by typing an IP address given in the router's manual into the browser's address bar, with which various technical changes can be made, such as changing the wireless network's password, and adjusting the router's firewall.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The rapid {{extension}} of communication requires systems having higher transmission capacity and lower infrastructure cost than {{is currently the}} case. For terrestrial communication, a very promising way is to upgrade existing cables by wireless local area networks using RF carriers in the frequency range 2. 4 … 60 GHz. We describe {{the design of a}} novel broadband λ-dipole coplanar antenna at 20 GHz using a photonic crystal structure, and we present measured results. Existing wired local area networks Copper pairs and the existing TV cabling allow accessing the Internet far faster than is possible with <b>voice-band</b> <b>modems.</b> An asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) may be configured on plain old telephone service (POTS) copper pairs between a sub-scriber and the first exchange node. In Ger-many, this `last mile ´ has an average length of 2 km, enabling downloads of up to 8 Mbit/s...|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of DSL and cable internet, <b>voice-band</b> <b>modems</b> and ISDN BRI were the most common residential internet access technologies. ISDN was widespread, with 333 ISDN BRIs per 1000 persons in 2005. DSL was introduced in Germany by Deutsche Telekom on July 1, 1999 under the brand name T-DSL, with 768 kbit/s downstream and 128 kbit/s upstream. T-DSL speeds were increased by Deutsche Telekom to 1536/192 kbit/s upstream/downstream in September 2002, 3072/384 kbit/s in April 2004, and 6016/576 kbit/s in mid-2005. Deutsche Telekom introduced ADSL2+ service with 16000/1024 kbit/s in spring 2006 and VDSL2 with 50000/10000 kbit/s triple play service under the brand name Entertain in October 2006. VDSL2 service without bundled IPTV was introduced in June 2009. In 2011, Deutsche Telekom introduced Voice over IP (VoIP) services over ADSL2+ Annex J. In February 2013, Deutsche Telekom started switching existing POTS and ISDN voice service subscribers to VoIP service. In August 2014, Deutsche Telekom became the first service provider to offer vectored VDSL2 using G.vector technology, offering 100/40 Mbit/s.|$|R
5000|$|The public {{switched}} telephone network, {{the network}} of switching centers, trunk lines, amplifiers and switches which transmits telephone calls from one phone to another, is designed to carry voice frequency signals, and is therefore limited to a bandwidth of 3.4 kHz. Before DSL, <b>voice-band</b> <b>modems</b> transmitted information through the telephone network with audio frequencies within that bandwidth, which limited them to a data rate of about 56 kbit/s. However, the copper wires that connect telephones with the local switching center (telephone exchange), called the subscriber loop, are actually able to carry a much wider band of frequencies, up to several megahertz. [...] This capacity is unused in normal phone service. DSL uses these higher frequencies to send digital data between the DSL modem and the local switching center, without interfering with normal telephone service. At the local switching center the data is transferred directly between the customer's phone line and internet lines, so DSL signals do not travel through the telephone network itself. It {{is not necessary to}} dial a telephone number to initiate a connection; the DSL connection is [...] "on" [...] whenever the modem is on.|$|R
