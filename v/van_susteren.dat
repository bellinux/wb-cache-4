25|$|He {{then spent}} 12 {{years as the}} Washington, D.C., {{managing}} editor of the Fox News Channel and the anchor of Special Report with Brit Hume. After retiring as the anchor of Special Report in 2008, he became a senior political analyst for Fox News and a regular panelist on Fox News Sunday.

[...] According to Morgan, writing in Reds, McCarthy's friend and campaign manager, attorney and judge Urban P. <b>Van</b> <b>Susteren,</b> had applied for active duty in the Army Air Force in early 1942, and advised McCarthy: [...] "Be a hero—join the Marines."

500|$|It {{appears that}} Ohio is using social {{security}} information to verify new voter registration, even though [...] "nder federal law, election officials {{are supposed to}} use the Social Security database to check a registration application {{only as a last}} resort, if no record of the applicant is found [...] databases," [...] according to a New York Times article. [...] Michael J. Astrue, commissioner of the Social Security Administration, alerted the United States Department of Justice and sent letters to six states including Ohio to ensure compliance with federal law. [...] Brunner has stated that the filing of paperwork by Republican officials may be an attempt to establish grounds for contesting ballots on Election Day. [...] The paperwork requires use of provisional ballots by persons with discrepant registrations. [...] On October 9, 2008, the Republicans also were granted an order against Brunner by Judge Smith requiring that Brunner must perform voter registration verification according to the Help America Vote Act. [...] Matching new registrants' information against Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles or the Social Security Administration databases is one of the requirements. Challenges to mismatched registrations, which force the use of provisional ballots, must be filed twenty days prior to the election. Legal expert Greta <b>Van</b> <b>Susteren</b> viewed the ruling as a significant breaking news story and interviewed Brunner on her show On the Record w/ Greta <b>Van</b> <b>Susteren</b> the day it was made. <b>Van</b> <b>Susteren</b> interpreted the ruling as a statement that Brunner has not been taking sufficient steps to prevent voter fraud. [...] Democracy Now! also interviewed Brunner on that day, but they did so before the final verdict.|$|E
500|$|Favre spoke {{publicly}} {{for the first}} time about his potential comeback in a July 14, 2008, interview with Greta <b>Van</b> <b>Susteren</b> on the Fox News Channel's On the Record with Greta <b>Van</b> <b>Susteren.</b> In the interview, Favre said he was [...] "guilty of retiring early", that he was [...] "never fully committed" [...] to retirement, and that he was pressured by the Packers to make a decision before the NFL Draft and the start of the free agent signing period. Favre disputed the notion that {{he does not want to}} play for Green Bay and said that while he understands the organization has decided to move on, they should now allow him to do the same. He made clear that he would not return to the Packers as a backup and reiterated his desire to be released rather than traded, which would allow him the freedom to play for a competitive team. Favre also accused the Packers of being dishonest, wishing the team would have been straightforward with him and the public.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{his views}} as a {{possible}} candidate during an appearance on On the Record with Greta <b>Van</b> <b>Susteren</b> in March 2009, Gingrich said, [...] "I am very sad {{that a number of}} Republicans do not understand that this country is sick of earmarks. [...] are sick of politicians taking care of themselves. They are sick of their money being spent {{in a way that is}} absolutely indefensible... I think you're going to see a steady increase in the number of incumbents who have opponents because the American taxpayers are increasingly fed up." ...|$|E
500|$|U.S. {{television}} networks devoted much air {{time to the}} search for Holloway, the investigation of her disappearance, and rumors surrounding the case. Greta <b>Van</b> <b>Susteren,</b> host of Fox News' On the Record, and Nancy Grace on her eponymous Headline News program were among the most prominent television personalities to devote time to the incident. Van Susteren's almost continuous coverage of the story caused On the Record to get its best ratings to date, while Grace's show became the cornerstone of the new [...] "Headline Prime" [...] block on Headline News, which ran two episodes (a live show and a repeat) every night during prime-time. As the case wore on, much of the attention was given to Beth Twitty and her statements. Aruban government spokesman Ruben Trapenberg stated, [...] "The case is under a microscope, and the world is watching." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens with}} the Griffin family {{attending}} the local Airshow in Quahog, and are {{shown to be}} anxiously awaiting one of the pilots to crash. After a pilot successfully lands, Peter expresses his boredom, and states that he would rather be home watching [...] "the tape from The Ring". In a flashback, Peter begins playing the film, after first being warned, with the 1987 film Mannequin appearing instead and having the same effect as the cursed tape. Deciding {{to stay at the}} airshow to watch their neighbor, Glenn Quagmire perform, he flies his plane through several billboards (specifically through the crotch of the women's images on the boards), including those for Veronica Mars, The Simple Life and On the Record w/ Greta <b>Van</b> <b>Susteren</b> (which he can only do after [...] "getting some help" [...] from [...] a Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey billboard.|$|E
500|$|... 2008: In early March, Favre {{announces that}} he is {{retiring}} from the Green Bay Packers. At a news conference he said [...] "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. It's been a great career for me, but it's over. As they say, all good things must come to an end. I look forward to whatever the future may hold for me." [...] Later in the month Favre has second thoughts and wants to return. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Favre backed out of a meeting with Packers management two days before re-entry talks were to begin. In April, Sam Farmer from the Los Angeles Times reported that Favre's agent Bus Cook was making inquiries to other teams about Favre. Favre responded by saying [...] "I {{have no idea where}} that came from, but it certainly didn't come from me. I'm happy about my decision and I haven't once said 'I wonder if I made the wrong decision.' I know it's the right one. It's kind of funny. Even when I'm retired, they won't let me stay retired." [...] Also in April, the Packers placed Favre on the Reserve-Retired list and planned to have Favre's number retired during the season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. In June, Favre said he told head coach Mike McCarthy he wanted {{to come back to the}} team. He said [...] "When he picked up the phone again after he dropped it, he said, 'Oh, God, Brett. You're putting us in a tight spot. He said, 'Brett, playing here is not an option.' Those were his exact, exact words." [...] In July, Favre sent a letter requesting his release from the Packers. A couple months earlier Favre contacted Mike McCarthy about coming out of retirement and was [...] "rebuffed" [...] according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Then a report came in from ESPN that said that Favre had wanted to come out of retirement but the Packers were reluctant to take him back. The Packers refused to give Favre an unconditional release. A few days later, Favre had an interview with Greta <b>Van</b> <b>Susteren</b> of Fox News where he accused general manager Ted Thompson of forcing him to make a decision on his return to the team too quickly. Two days after the interview, the Packers filed tampering charges with the NFL front office charging that the Minnesota Vikings had inappropriate contact with Favre. The Packers then offered Favre a retirement package of $25 million marketing agreement to remain retired. This offer was rejected and Favre was subsequently traded to the New York Jets.|$|E

[...] <b>Van</b> <b>Susteren</b> and her TV crew had accompanied Graham on Samaritan's Purse trips to Haiti and North Korea. [...] The Charlotte Observer quoted Graham saying [...] " [...] {{was on her}} show, and [...] said, ‘I was just in Haiti and Samaritan’s Purse is doing this down there, and Donald, you need to help.’ He sent a check out."

2500|$|A 2016 {{study found}} that Hannity {{promoted}} a number of falsehoods about the Affordable Care Act. For instance, Hannity falsely alleged several times that Democratic Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus had said Social Security could be “insolvent in two years” due to the Affordable Care Act. According to the study, Hannity, unlike other Fox News hosts such as Bill O'Reilly and Greta <b>Van</b> <b>Susteren,</b> [...] "took a more direct approach, aggressively supporting Republicans and conservatives and attacking Democrats and liberals, endorsing the more spurious claims long after they were proven incorrect, and putting advocacy above accurate reporting, to further the network’s themes opposing reform." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} morning {{in an interview}} with Good Morning America he said the following on Egypt [...] "This virus spreading throughout the Middle East proves the universality of human yearnings, and probably the only place where you won't see these demonstrations is Iraq." [...] He also said on Fox News to Gretta <b>Van</b> <b>Susteren</b> [...] "This virus is spreading throughout the Middle East. The president of Yemen, as you know, just made the announcement that he wasn’t running again. This, I would argue, is probably the most dangerous period of history in – of our entire involvement in the Middle East, at least in modern times. Israel is in danger of being surrounded by countries that are against the very existence of Israel, are governed by radical organizations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Palin {{has stated}} that she {{supports}} a Federal Constitutional Amendment to ban same-sex marriage. This position differed with that of her running mate, John McCain. In a July 31, 2012 interview with Greta <b>Van</b> <b>Susteren,</b> Palin was asked about states' rights as they pertained to same-sex marriage, to which Palin responded, [...] "I believe that states have that constitutional right {{to make decisions about}} a variety of issues, {{but when it comes to}} some very fundamental, very cornerstone aspects of our society, of our culture, I personally would love to see a national dialogue about what will America continue to define as marriage. As a former Governor, I say let the states decide that, and that's where I would be, if I were in national office. I'd be saying let the states decide. And if you see, Greta, and pay attention to where the states have gone with this particular issue and the votes of the people, overwhelmingly the people within the states have said they want to continue to define marriage as one man and one woman, as the Muslims do, Orthodox Jews do, nondenominational Christians do, faith-practicing Catholics do. It truly is a cornerstone of religion and civilization." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 4, 2007, the Romney {{campaign}} officially {{launched the}} [...] "Mitt Mobile, A Five Brothers Bus", referring to Romney's five sons and his official campaign blog, [...] When asked why his sons were not fighting in Iraq, Romney replied that his sons were supporting America by riding {{from town to}} town in the [...] "Five Brothers Bus," [...] saying [...] "One of the ways my sons are showing support for our nation is helping me get elected." [...] Romney later apologized and said he misspoke and that there is no comparison to the sacrifice that military persons make. The RV, a Winnebago made in Iowa, had a large map of Iowa on the back and a Romney family portrait on the side with the label [...] "Mitt Mobile", [...] "A Five Brothers Bus". The Mitt Mobile was planned to visit all of Iowa's ninety-nine counties. Each county was checked off on the large map {{on the back of the}} RV once it was visited. On August 11, 2007, the Mitt Mobile visited Iowa's ninety-ninth county at the Ames Straw Poll. [...] The Mitt Mobile is planned to also tour Florida, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and other key primary states. The Mitt Mobile has been a large success in attracting attention, and was even featured on Fox News' On the Record with Greta <b>Van</b> <b>Susteren.</b> Susteren interviewed Matt, Josh, and Craig Romney and toured and drove the Mitt Mobile.|$|E
