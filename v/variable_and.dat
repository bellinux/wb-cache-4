50|$|The {{two kinds}} of {{variables}} commonly used in Smalltalk are instance <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> temporary <b>variables.</b> Other <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> related terminology depend on the particular implementation.

5|$|A third, more {{graphical}} way {{of describing}} a 2-satisfiability instance is as an implication graph. An implication graph is a directed graph {{in which there}} is one vertex per variable or negated <b>variable,</b> <b>and</b> an edge connecting one vertex to another whenever the corresponding variables are related by an implication in the implicative normal form of the instance. An implication graph must be a skew-symmetric graph, meaning that it has a symmetry that takes each variable to its negation and reverses the orientations of all of the edges.|$|E

It is characterized by <b>variable</b> <b>and</b> recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These episodes may occur {{a few times a}} day or a few times per week.

5|$|Established {{traits are}} not immutable; traits that have high fitness in one {{environmental}} context {{may be much}} less fit if environmental conditions change. In the absence of natural selection to preserve such a trait, it becomes more <b>variable</b> <b>and</b> deteriorate over time, possibly resulting in a vestigial manifestation of the trait, also called evolutionary baggage. In many circumstances, the apparently vestigial structure may retain a limited functionality, or may be co-opted for other advantageous traits in a phenomenon known as preadaptation. A famous example of a vestigial structure, {{the eye of the}} blind mole-rat, is believed to retain function in photoperiod perception.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Suillus americanus has {{a similar}} appearance, but a more easterly distribution. It is {{associated}} with eastern white pine. Although some authors have tried {{to distinguish between the}} two with by using width of the stem, or by differences in fruit body colouration, it is acknowledged that these characteristics are <b>variable,</b> <b>and</b> depend on environmental factors. The phylogenetic analysis of Wu and colleagues (2000) suggests that the two taxa may be the same, although more samples from different geographical areas will be needed to verify this.|$|E
5|$|Lemur diets {{are highly}} <b>variable</b> <b>and</b> {{demonstrate}} {{a high degree}} of plasticity, although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects (omnivory), while the larger species are more herbivorous, consuming mostly plant material. As with all primates, hungry lemurs might eat anything that is edible, whether or not the item is one of their preferred foods. For instance, the ring-tailed lemur eats insects and small vertebrates when necessary and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic omnivore. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (Mirza coquereli) is mostly frugivorous, but will consume insect secretions during the dry season.|$|E

5|$|Several {{varieties}} of M.rotula have been described. Miles Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis named var. fuscus in 1869 for its brown cap. In 1887 Pier Andrea Saccardo described var. microcephalus from Italy, with caps half the normal size. It is now understood, however, that fruit body morphology is <b>variable</b> <b>and</b> dependent upon environmental conditions. Joseph Schröter described var. phyllophyla in 1889, but that taxon is now treated as Marasmius bulliardii.|$|E

5|$|The inner {{mitochondrial}} membrane is compartmentalized into numerous cristae, which expand {{the surface area}} of the inner {{mitochondrial membrane}}, enhancing its ability to produce ATP. For typical liver mitochondria, {{the area of the}} inner membrane is about five times as large as the outer membrane. This ratio is <b>variable</b> <b>and</b> mitochondria from cells that have a greater demand for ATP, such as muscle cells, contain even more cristae. These folds are studded with small round bodies known as F1 particles or oxysomes. These are not simple random folds but rather invaginations of the inner membrane, which can affect overall chemiosmotic function.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{power is}} <b>variable,</b> <b>and</b> during low wind periods {{it must be}} {{replaced}} by other power sources. Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of intermittent power sources such as wind power, is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, {{may be able to}} deliver their nameplate capacity around 95% of the time.|$|E
5|$|Wing {{areas are}} delimited and {{subdivided}} by fold-lines along which the wing can fold, and flexion-lines along which the wing can flex during flight. The fundamental {{distinction between the}} flexion-lines and the fold-lines is often blurred, as fold-lines may permit some flexibility or vice versa. Two constants that are found in nearly all insect wings are the claval (a flexion-line) and jugal folds (or fold line); forming <b>variable</b> <b>and</b> unsatisfactory boundaries. Wing foldings can very complicated, with transverse folding occurs in the hindwings of Dermaptera and Coleoptera, and in some insects the anal area can be folded like a fan.|$|E
5|$|Blacktip reef sharks have {{extremely}} small home ranges and exhibit strong site fidelity, remaining {{within the same}} local area for up to several years at a time. They are active predators of small bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, and have also been known to feed on sea snakes and seabirds. Accounts of the blacktip reef shark's life history have been <b>variable</b> <b>and</b> sometimes contradictory, in part reflecting geographical differences within the species. Like other members of its family, this shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to two to five young on a biennial, annual, or possibly biannual cycle. Reports of the gestation period range from 7–9, through 10–11, to possibly 16 months. Mating is preceded by the male following closely behind the female, likely attracted by her chemical signals. Newborn sharks are found further inshore and in shallower water than adults, frequently roaming in large groups over areas flooded by high tide.|$|E

5|$|Details of {{the fruit}} bodies' appearance, color in particular, are {{somewhat}} <b>variable</b> <b>and</b> dependent on growing conditions. For example, specimens growing on logs in oak and hickory forests in the spring {{tend to have more}} yellowish-white, depressed caps than those found in the same location in autumn, which are light yellow brown and more convex in shape. The fruit body development of M.rotula is hemiangiocarpous, with an hymenium that is only partially enclosed by basidiocarp tissues. Robert Kühner showed that a -like tissue covers the young gills before the expanding cap breaks away from the stem. In unfavorable weather conditions, however, the mushrooms may fail to develop normally and instead produce semi-gasteroid basidiocarps.|$|E
5|$|Eta Hydri is {{the other}} optical double, {{composed}} of Eta1 and Eta2. Eta1 is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B9V that was suspected of being <b>variable,</b> <b>and</b> is located just over 700 light-years away. Eta2 has a magnitude of 4.7 and is a yellow giant star of spectral type G8.5III around 218 light-years distant, which has evolved off the main sequence and is expanding and cooling {{on its way to}} becoming a red giant. Calculations of its mass indicate it was most likely a white A-type main sequence star for most of its existence, around twice the mass of our Sun. A planet, Eta2 Hydri b, greater than 6.5 times the mass of Jupiter was discovered in 2005, orbiting around Eta2 every 711 days at a distance of 1.93 astronomical units (AU).|$|E

The game can end prematurely if the player makes the wrong decisions. When this occurs, the player must go back to a previously saved spot and choose different decisions.|$|E
