E. McWilliam Gallery & Studio in partnership with the NCAD Gallery at the National College of Art & Design. The exhibition takes its title from the tangible starting point for engagement with an archive – the simple act of unfolding – and the practice of appraisal, <b>valuation</b> <b>and</b> <b>interpretation</b> that is inherent in this process...|$|E
40|$|Improvement {{of safety}} and health in the {{workplace}} can bring economic benefits for both the individual worker, company and the society as a whole. Employers and decision makers can be convinced of the profitability of improving working conditions by making financial and economic estimations. This booklet shows how to make an economic estimation of improved working conditions. It discusses the most important pitfalls and explanations about relevant principles and provides practical outlines, references and suggestions for further reading. Background information explains how safety and health at work affects costs and benefits in companies. The context in which evaluations usually take place is described to understand {{the results of an}} evaluation and to decide how an economic assessment is going to be performed. The book shows how the economic asessment can be made in five steps: preparing, selecting variables and indicators, finding data, <b>valuation</b> <b>and</b> calculations, <b>and</b> <b>interpretation,</b> use <b>and</b> refinement of results...|$|R

50|$|Znaniecki's {{model was}} derived {{independently}} of Max Weber and Émile Durkheim. The concept of agency derived by Claude Lévi-Strauss provided {{the foundations for}} structuralism and the later work of sociologists such as Pierre Bourdieu. Structuralists influenced by humanistic sociology will interpret data in terms of opposing <b>valuations,</b> contrasts, <b>and</b> relations. <b>Interpretation</b> of the data must be contextual. Structuralism allows for a realist analysis (structures represent an organized reality) {{in relation to the}} larger social system. By understanding the larger social system, you are differentiating from post-modernism, which seeks to describe society by its lack of structure, or fragmentation.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the links between}} the informational {{relevance}} of earnings components for <b>valuation</b> <b>and</b> for forecasting abnormal earnings. We show that forecasting irrelevance implies valuation irrelevance. However, except in the case where aggregate earnings is the sufficient earnings construct for <b>valuation</b> <b>and</b> forecasting, <b>valuation</b> irrelevance does not imply forecasting irrelevance. Additionally, we show that to be irrelevant for <b>valuation</b> <b>and</b> forecasting, an earnings component need not be unpredictable. Our analysis has implications for the design <b>and</b> <b>interpretation</b> of empirical tests of informational relevance. It also has potential implications for practical investment analysis. Generally, value estimates based on aggregate earnings {{are expected to be}} less precise than value estimates based on knowledge of earnings components and their relation to other accounting items...|$|R
40|$|When {{considering}} the valuation techniques of income-producing property, {{various types of}} information should {{be obtained from the}} market in order to apply them to the valuation of the property under consideration. This includes the comparison with other properties sold in the market. However, due to the illiquid nature of property, especially those typically owned by institutional investors, such transactions do not take place every day. Therefore the necessary information is not always readily available, and also not of the required quality. In order to try and eliminate this problem, the study considers the possibility of using alternative information to indicate market activities. Various studies have considered the similarities of direct real estate and indirect real estate. Most of these studies compare the investment returns of the two markets. This study extends the research by specifically looking at the unique property loan stock structure of South Africa, and comparing the value of shares to the value of assets. It therefore offers a more comprehensive explanation of the factors over and above the return received on the investment. It furthermore considers the composition of the property portfolio and the possibility to measure individual property values within such a portfolio. The outcome of the study is a model that allows property <b>valuation</b> <b>and</b> market <b>interpretation</b> from fundamental principles, with supporting evidence from the listed-property investment market.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the ownership and control structure of Brazilian {{companies and the}} effect of cash flow and voting rights on firm <b>valuation</b> <b>and</b> performance. Ownership is quite concentrated in Brazil with most companies being controlled by a single direct shareholder. We find evidence that non-voting shares and indirect control structures are largely used to concentrate control with reduced overall investment in the company. Our results support the hypothesis that firm <b>valuation</b> <b>and</b> performance are positively related to cash flow concentration, and negatively related to voting concentration and to the separation of voting from cash flow rights. Moreover, firm <b>valuation</b> <b>and</b> performance are relatively higher for firms with controlling shareholders when compared to firms without controlling shareholders...|$|R
