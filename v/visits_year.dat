40|$|Copyright © 2002 F D I World Dental PressAim: To {{investigate}} time {{trends in}} practice activity. Design: Four cross-sectional surveys across a 15 year period. Setting: Australian private general practice. Participants: A {{random sample of}} dentists. Methods: Dentists were surveyed by mailed questionnaire in 1983, 1988, 1993 and 1998 (response rates 71 %- 75 %). Data were weighted to provide representative estimates for the age by sex distribution of private general practitioners in 1983, 1988, 1993 and 1998. Main Outcome Measures: Hours per <b>year</b> worked, patient <b>visits</b> per hour and patient <b>visits</b> per <b>year.</b> Results: The number of patient <b>visits</b> per <b>year</b> declined across the period, related to parallel decreases {{in the number of}} patient visits per hour (ANOVA; P< 0. 05), while {{there was no significant difference}} during the period in the number of hours per year devoted to work. The interaction of dentist sex by time of survey indicated that while numbers of patient <b>visits</b> per <b>year</b> had remained stable for female dentists, there was a trend for the higher number of patient <b>visits</b> per <b>year</b> among male dentists at the beginning of the survey period to decline over time. Conclusions: Male dentists had higher levels of practice activity compared with female dentists, but a decline in the number of patient <b>visits</b> per <b>year</b> reflected a convergence of male practice patterns towards that of female dentists.
