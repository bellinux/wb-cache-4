5000|$|Poison Ivy {{makes her}} first {{appearance}} in Batman: Arkham Asylum. This iteration's appearance was revamped to the naked-goddess persona, wearing only an orange prison-issued shirt and foliage panties, and her appearance is also more plant-like having green skin, with vine-like growths and leaves on her body. She acts as the penultimate boss. She first appears in the Penitentiary, begging {{to be released from}} her cell so she can help her [...] "babies" [...] (as she can apparently feel the pain Doctor Young inflicted on the island's plants while creating a <b>Venom-plant</b> hybrid in order to create the Titan drug). She is later released by Harley Quinn, after which she makes a beeline for the Botanical Gardens. Batman later tracks her down, and after some convincing (by way of crushing one of her vines when it tries to attack), she tells Batman that the molds growing in Killer Croc's lair can be used to create a Titan antidote. After Batman leaves, the Joker arrives and gives Poison Ivy a double-dose of Titan, causing her plants to sprout up randomly and grow to massive proportions, wreaking havoc across the island and destroying the makeshift Batcave in the sewer systems. When Batman returns to stop her, Poison Ivy attacks with spore projectiles, hypnotized guards, and an enormous mutated plant-monster. Batman eventually defeats her, and she can later be seen being returned to her cell.|$|E
