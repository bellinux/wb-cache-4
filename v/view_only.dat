5|$|Ian Drake, an {{assistant}} professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact, has argued that the constitution both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact. In Drake's <b>view,</b> <b>only</b> a constitutional amendment could make the compact valid. Authors Michael Brody, Jennifer Hendricks, and Bradley Turflinger have examined the compact and concluded that the NPVIC, if successfully enacted, would pass constitutional muster. Brody has put forth a unique theory that the legality of the NPVIC could potentially hinge on the notion that faithless electors are not necessarily obligated to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged.|$|E
5|$|Since looking {{directly}} at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness, special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. It is technically safe to <b>view</b> <b>only</b> the total phase of a total solar eclipse {{with the unaided eye}} and without protection; however, this is a dangerous practice, as most people are not trained to recognize the phases of an eclipse, which can span over two hours while the total phase can only last a maximum of 7.5 minutes for any one location. People referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will travel to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, American general Stephen Van Rensselaer III, a Federalist {{political}} appointee, {{in command}} of a sizable army near Lewiston, was pressured by the American president to invade. Although Van Rensselaer had severe doubts {{about the quality of}} his troops, {{he had no choice but}} to attack. He was an inexperienced militia general, and not trusted by the majority of regular army troops. In the early morning of 13 October 1812, he attempted to cross the Niagara River, leading to the Battle of Queenston Heights. Despite heavy fire from British artillery, the first wave of Americans (under Captain John E. Wool) managed to land, and then follow a fishermen's path up to the heights. From this point, they attacked and routed the British artillery. Brock had arrived from nearby Fort George and moved up to the artillery battery to gain a better <b>view</b> <b>only</b> minutes before Wool attacked. He, his aides, and the gunners were forced to beat a hasty retreat, leading their horses down the steep slope.|$|E

25|$|The rate {{at which}} it spread was no faster than {{the spread of the}} Neolithic in general. Accordingly, Dolukhanov and others {{postulate}} that an impulse from the steppe to the southeast of the barrier stimulated the Mesolithics north of it to innovate their own pottery.

25|$|New England is {{the first}} {{region of the country}} where all states within it have granted {{marriage}} rights to same-sex couples. The rapid makeover of its legal landscape made New England a notable standout within the United States.

25|$|Boötes is {{in a part}} of the {{celestial}} sphere facing away from the plane of our home Milky Way galaxy, and so does not have open clusters or nebulae. Instead, it has one bright globular cluster and many faint galaxies. The globular cluster NGC 5466 has an overall magnitude of 9.1 and a diameter of 11 arcminutes. It is a very loose globular cluster with fairly few stars and may appear as a rich, concentrated open cluster in a telescope. NGC 5466 is classified as a Shapley-Sawyer Concentration Class 12 cluster, reflecting its sparsity. Its fairly large diameter means that it has a low surface brightness, so it appears far dimmer than the catalogued magnitude of 9.1 and requires a large amateur telescope to <b>view.</b> <b>Only</b> approximately 12 stars are resolved by an amateur instrument.|$|E

He proposed Vladimir Putin as the first Prince of the formation, which he renamed in 2009 to Eurasian Union and proposed St Petersburg as its capital by 2012, when in his <b>view</b> <b>only</b> 3 planetary centres of force would exist – the European Union (EU-1), the Eurasian Union (EU-2), and the Chinese Commonwealth. In April 2009 he proposed a second, Southern capital – Alma-Ata and in May 2009 – two more capitals: Kiev in 2014 and Belgrade in 2020.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS): The UVIS is a remote-sensing {{instrument}} that captures {{images of the}} ultraviolet light reflected off an object, such as the clouds of Saturn and/or its rings, {{to learn more about}} their structure and composition. Designed to measure ultraviolet light over wavelengths from 55.8 to 190nm, this instrument is also a tool to help determine the composition, distribution, aerosol particle content and temperatures of their atmospheres. Unlike other types of spectrometer, this sensitive instrument can take both spectral and spatial readings. It is particularly adept at determining the composition of gases. Spatial observations take a wide-by-narrow <b>view,</b> <b>only</b> one pixel tall and 64 pixels across. The spectral dimension is 1,024 pixels per spatial pixel. Also, it can take many images that create movies {{of the ways in which}} this material is moved around by other forces.|$|E
25|$|The art of {{the ancient}} Near East, and also in archaic Greece, used only the frontal and profile <b>view.</b> <b>Only</b> {{classical}} Greek style introduced an intermediate step, especially the three-quarter view. Representations of the classical Greeks tried the illusion of life in all its forms. The characters are totally preoccupied with themselves and ignore the viewer. The frontal view is also found here, but {{is only one of}} many possibilities. Parthian art certainly took over the frontal view of Hellenistic art, but it appears the Parthians in their art again took recourse with the presence of the Ancient Orient. The Parthian art is not an illusion and tried to capture the fleeting nature of life. Rather, they tried to give the figures durability. They tried to capture the true content of life and not just the outer shell. The effect of such methods is often that the viewer feels transcended.|$|E

500|$|According to Selway, Radiohead's American label Capitol saw {{the album}} as [...] "more or less, 'commercial suicide'. They weren't really into it. At that point, {{we got the}} fear. How {{is this going to}} be received?" [...] According to Yorke, [...] "When we first gave [...] to Capitol, they were taken aback. I don't really know why it's so {{important}} now, but I'm excited about it." [...] Capitol lowered its sales forecast from two million units to a half a million. In O'Brien's <b>view</b> <b>only</b> Parlophone, the band's British label, remained optimistic while global distributors dramatically reduced their sales estimates. Label representatives were reportedly disappointed with the lack of potential marketable singles, especially the absence of anything resembling Radiohead's early hit [...] "Creep".|$|E
500|$|Colley's death horrified Kruger, {{who feared}} it might {{jeopardise}} the peace process. His reply to Colley's letter {{was delivered to}} his successor Sir Evelyn Wood on 7 March 1881, a day after Wood and Joubert had agreed to an eight-day truce. Kruger was outraged to learn of this armistice, which in his <b>view</b> <b>only</b> gave the British opportunity to strengthen their forces—he expected a British attempt to avenge Majuba, which indeed Wood and others wanted—but Gladstone wanted peace, and Wood was instructed to proceed with talks. Negotiations began on 16 March. The British offered amnesty for the Boer leaders, retrocession of the Transvaal under British suzerainty, a British resident in Pretoria and British control over foreign affairs. Kruger pressed on how the British intended to withdraw and what exactly [...] "suzerainty" [...] meant. Brand arrived to mediate on 20 March and the following day agreement was reached; the British committed to formally restore the republic within six months. The final treaty was concluded on 23 March 1881.|$|E
500|$|Rand {{described}} Night of January 16th as [...] "a sense-of-life play". She did {{not want}} its events to be taken literally, but {{to be understood as}} a representation of different ways of approaching life. Andre represents an ambitious, confident, non-conformist approach to life, while the prosecution witnesses represent conformity, envy of success, and the desire for power over others. Rand believed the jury's decision at each performance revealed the attitude of the jurors towards these two conflicting senses of life. Rand supported individualism and considered Andre [...] "not guilty". She said she wanted the play to convey the viewpoint: [...] "Your life, your achievement, your happiness, [...] are of paramount importance. Live up to your highest vision of yourself no matter what the circumstances you might encounter. An exalted view of self-esteem is man's most admirable quality". She said the play [...] "is not a philosophical treatise on morality" [...] and represents this <b>view</b> <b>only</b> in a basic way. Rand would later expound an explicit philosophy, which she called [...] "Objectivism", particularly in her 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged and in non-fiction essays, but Night of January 16th predates these more philosophical works.|$|E

500|$|Two months later, the EPB granted an {{interview}} to Claridad, where the organization discussed its stance on several topics.

However, the organization did differentiate Fortuño from his predecessor, claiming that that [...] "as a fervent servant of the Republican neoliberal capitalism" [...] he employed [...] "an strategy to downsize the government, privatize anything that is of interest to bond and capital holders and to eliminate all that is preserving {{the culture of the}} Puerto Rican nation alive". The Macheteros expressed concern that this administration wanted to portray the wealthy as the answer to the economic crisis, [...] "which are really the fault of all government administrations, including Mr. Fortuño's". The group also disregarded all measures adopted by the legislature, which in their <b>view</b> <b>only</b> responded to the economic interests of the wealthy, which they considered [...] "perhaps the worst of all" [...] and warning the PPD legislators led by Hector Ferrer that [...] "weak opposition [...] into accomplices".|$|E
