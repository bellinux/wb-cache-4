40|$|A heat {{transfer}} experimental of <b>vertical</b> out-tube <b>falling</b> film {{was conducted with}} different inlet spray density of ammonia water solution and inlet hot water temperature. The inlet liquid mass concentration was selected as 60 % of ammonia. The experiments showed that the overall {{heat transfer}} coefficient increases with the increase of inlet spray density and a maximum {{overall heat transfer coefficient}} could be obtained in an optimum spray density of ammonia water solution Γ between 0. 26 and 0. 29 kg·m- 1 ·s- 1. The generation of ammonia vapor outside the <b>vertical</b> <b>falling</b> film had a similar trend with the overall heat transfer coefficient basing on different spray density. The effect of hot water temperature difference ΔT on overall heat transfer coefficient showed that ΔT between 10 and 13 K is the optimum temperature difference of the <b>vertical</b> <b>falling</b> film generation...|$|R

50|$|The Mi-28 is a new-generation attack {{helicopter}} that functions as an air-to-air and air-to-ground partner for the Mi-24 Hind and Ka-50 Hokum. The five-blade main rotor is mounted above the body midsection, and short, wide, tapered, weapon-carrying wings are mounted {{to the rear}} of body midsection. Two turboshaft engines in pods are mounted alongside the top of the fuselage with downturned exhausts. The fuselage is slender and tapers to the tail boom and nose. It features a tandem, stepped-up cockpits and a cannon mounted beneath the belly, with non-retractable tricycle tail-wheel type landing gear. This energy-absorbing landing gear and seats protect the crew in a crash landing or in a low-altitude <b>vertical</b> <b>fall.</b> The crew is able to survive a <b>vertical</b> <b>fall</b> of up to 12 m/s. The Mi-28 has a fully armoured cabin, including the windshield, which withstands impact by 7.62 and 12.7mm armor piercing bullets and 20mm shell fragments.|$|R

We show that two types of trajectories can be observed: if the initial velocity is smaller than the terminal velocity of free fall, we observe the classical Galilean parabola: if it is larger, the projectile decelerates with an asymmetric trajectory first drawn by Tartaglia, which ends with a nearly <b>vertical</b> <b>fall,</b> as if a wall impeded the movement.

40|$|In pure heat transfer, {{specifications}} of effectiveness, fluid properties, {{and flows}} enable {{calculation of the}} heat exchanger area. In the case of falling film absorption, a simultaneous heat and mass transfer governs {{the performance of the}} absorber. The exchange of mass across the liquid-vapor interface involves the generation of heat. The heat effects associated with the mass exchange increase the temperature, which affects the equilibrium state of the pressure and composition and in turn affects the mass. The falling film flow rate coupled to the physical properties of kinematic viscosity and surface tension govern the flow regime of a <b>vertical</b> <b>falling</b> film. Wavy-laminar, roll-wave laminar, and turbulent flows will develop convective contributions that can enhance the transfer of mass into the film. The combined interaction of all these factors makes the absorption process very difficult to analyze and predict. A study of simultaneous heat and mass transfer was therefore conduct ed on a <b>vertical</b> <b>falling</b> film absorber to better understand the mechanisms driving the heat and mass transfer processes. Falling films are characteristically unstable, and a wavy-laminar flow was observed during the experimental study. The wavy flow further complicates the problem; therefore, only limited information is known about the temperature and concentration profiles {{along the length of the}} absorber that describe the local heat and mass transfer rates...|$|R

5000|$|Horizontal falling film {{evaporators}} have {{a number}} of potential advantages over their vertical counterparts in the petrochemical industry, such as the ability to use tubes with external enhancements. ( [...] Internally enhanced tubes are available for <b>vertical</b> <b>falling</b> film evaporators, but external enhancements are far superior for boiling applications). The chief disadvantage of horizontal falling film evaporators is that if a corrosive or fouling liquid is to be evaporated, it will have to placed on the shell side. This is against best practice, as it is easier to clean fouling found on the inside of tubes rather than the outside.|$|R

The start zone is visible {{near the top}} of the image, the track is in the middle of the image and clearly denoted by vegetative trimlines, and the runout zone is shown at the bottom of the image. One possible timeline is as follows: an avalanche forms in the start zone near the ridge, and then descends the track, until coming to rest in the runout zone.|$|R
50|$|The Interior Grain Tramway was {{an aerial}} tramway built in 1901 near Pullman, Washington to move grain in sacks from the Palouse hills to the Snake River over a {{horizontal}} distance of 1200 m and a <b>vertical</b> <b>fall</b> of 700 m. Grain was stored in warehouses {{at the top}} and bottom of the tramway for shipment on riverboats to a railroad terminal at Riparia, Washington, 40 mi away, with a capacity of up to 250,000 bushels per year. The tramway operated until 1938, when competition from rail service made it obsolescent. Eight of the tramways towers remain standing, and at least 27 have collapsed.|$|R
40|$|Studies of cycad {{pollination}} globally {{have revealed}} obligate pollination mutualisms with insects, typically hostspecific beetles. Some cycads in the genus Cycas have floating seeds allowing oceanic dispersal, and have colonized remote islands such as Fiji, Guam, and Madagascar. This seems {{to contradict the}} expected requirement that specific beetle pollinators be present in order for cycads to establish in remote localities. We therefore postulated that these ‘island’ cycads are wind pollinated. We tested for adaptations associated with wind pollination in a laboratory study of pollen aerodynamics. The pollen {{from a range of}} (non-cycad) wind-pollinated plants was not relatively ‘buoyant’: the settling velocities of wind-pollinated species exceeded those of insect-pollinated cycads and some animal-pollinated angiosperms. We attributed this result to settling velocity being, in part, correlated with pollen size, as cycad pollen was consistently smaller. A better predictor for pollination vector was the tendency of pollen to aggregate during a <b>vertical</b> <b>fall.</b> Pollen of wind-pollinated plants separated into single grains, whereas cycad pollen and pollen of animal-pollinated angiosperms adhered in large aggregations, the settling velocity of which increased rapidly with aggregate size. The pollen of cycads known to be insect pollinated was similar in morphology, settling speed, and clumping behaviour to pollen of ‘island’ cycads of unknown pollination biology. Based on these aerodynamics, we predict that cycad species on oceanic islands have insect pollinators. More broadly, we propose that pollen aggregation during a <b>vertical</b> <b>fall</b> provides a sound test for wind versus animal pollination when the pollination vector is unknown...|$|R
40|$|A uniform, {{flexible}} and frictionless chain falling link by link from a heap by {{the edge of}} a table falls with an acceleration g/ 3 if the motion is nonconservative, but g/ 2 if the motion is conservative, g being the acceleration due to gravity.

After frictional effects are corrected for, its <b>vertical</b> <b>falling</b> acceleration is found to be a_x/g = 0. 328 ± 0. 004.
