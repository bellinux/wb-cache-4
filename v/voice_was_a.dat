But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, when you become friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.|$|E

25|$|Xfinity Voice allows {{communication}} {{over the}} internet using VoIP, but uses a private network instead of a public IP address, which allows Comcast to prioritize the voice data during heavy traffic. In technical terms, on Comcast's Hybrid Fiber Coaxial network, calls are placed into individual Unsolicited Grant Service flows, based on DOCSIS 1.1 Quality of service standards. For the customer, this has the benefit of preventing network congestion from interfering with call quality. However, this separation of traffic into separate flows, or Smart pipe, has been seen {{by some as a}} violation of net neutrality, who call instead for equal treatment of all data, or dumb pipe. Other, non-Comcast VoIP services on Comcast's network must use the lower priority public IP addresses. The practice was questioned by the FCC in 2009. In their response, Comcast stated that services that use telecommunications are not necessarily telecommunications services, and noted the FCC's current designation of Comcast Digital Voice as an information service exempted it from telecommunications service regulations. Comcast also said that because Comcast <b>Voice</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> separate service, it was unfair to directly compare the data for Comcast Voice with the data for other VoIP services.|$|E
500|$|Trent's Last Case is an {{adaptation}} of British author E. C. Bentley's 1913 novel of the same name, which had already been adapted for cinema in England in 1920. Hawks considered the novel to be [...] "one of the greatest detective stories of all time" [...] and was eager to make it his first sound film. He cast Raymond Griffith in the lead role of Phillip Trent. Griffith's throat had been damaged by poison gas during World War I and his <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> hoarse whisper, prompting Hawks to later state, [...] "I thought {{he ought to be}} great in talking pictures because of that voice." [...] However, after shooting only a few scenes, Fox shut Hawks down and ordered him to make a silent film, both because of Griffith's voice and because they only owned the legal rights to make a silent film. The film did have a musical score and synchronized sound effects, but no dialogue. Due to the failing business of silent films, it was never released in the US and only briefly screened in England where film critics hated it. The film was believed lost until the mid-1970s and was screened {{for the first time in}} the US at a Hawks retrospective in 1974. Hawks was in attendance of the screening and attempted to have the only print of the film destroyed.|$|E
500|$|... "The Crepes of Wrath" [...] was {{the first}} episode of The Simpsons for which George Meyer was {{credited}} as a writer, and he wrote it together with Sam Simon, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. The episode {{was inspired by the}} French movie Manon of the Spring. The writers were trying to figure out which country the foreign exchange student should come from when they came up with Albania. They had not seen many uses of the country on television and decided to make the episode a tribute to actor John Belushi, who has Albanian roots. The writers did not know much about the country and could not think of a good name for the boy so they gave him the surname Hoxha after the former leader of Albania, Enver Hoxha. They used real Albanian in the scene where Adil says goodbye to his family, and they tried to get the actual language right at Sam Simon's instigation. They also used real French in the scenes of Bart in France. The writers did some research on a certain airport in France for the shots of Bart at the airport in Paris. Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes Skinner, made her first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode, although her <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bit different from what the viewers are used to in the later episodes of the show.|$|E

The staccatos were marvels of accuracy, {{even in the}} trickiest intervals, her legato was impressively smooth and pure; she connects the voice from note to note, phrase to phrase, lifting and gliding with an exceptional virtuosity. Her chromatic scale was deliciously sweet, and her trill was wonderful and solid." ...|$|E

[...] "Corpus Christi Carol" [...] was sung entirely in a high falsetto. The pitch and volume of his singing was also highly variable, as songs such as [...] "Mojo Pin" [...] and [...] "Dream Brother" [...] began with mid-range quieter vocals before reaching louder, higher peaks near the ending of the songs.|$|E

2500|$|Callas's {{voice has}} been {{difficult}} to place in the modern vocal classification or Fach system, especially since in her prime, her repertoire contained the heaviest dramatic soprano roles as well as roles usually undertaken by the highest, lightest and most agile coloratura sopranos. Regarding this versatility, Tullio Serafin said, [...] "This woman can sing anything written for the female voice". Michael Scott argues that Callas's <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> natural high soprano, and going by evidence of Callas's early recordings, Rosa Ponselle likewise felt that [...] "At that stage of its development, her <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pure but sizable dramatic coloratura—that is to say, a sizable coloratura voice with dramatic capabilities, not the other way around." [...] On the other hand, music critic John Ardoin has argued that Callas was the reincarnation of the 19th-century soprano sfogato or [...] "unlimited soprano", a throwback to Maria Malibran and Giuditta Pasta, for whom many of the famous bel canto operas were written. He avers that like Pasta and Malibran, Callas was a natural mezzo-soprano whose range was extended through training and willpower, resulting in a voice which [...] "lacked the homogeneous color and evenness of scale once so prized in singing. There were unruly sections of their voices never fully under control. Many who heard Pasta, for example, remarked that her uppermost notes seemed produced by ventriloquism, a charge which would later be made against Callas". Ardoin points to the writings of Henry Chorley about Pasta which bear an uncanny resemblance to descriptions of Callas: ...|$|E

2500|$|Marian Anderson (February 27, 1897 – April 8, 1993) was an African-American contralto {{and one of}} {{the most}} celebrated singers of the twentieth century. Music critic Alan Blyth said: [...] "Her <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> rich, vibrant contralto of {{intrinsic}} beauty." [...] Most of her singing career was spent performing in concert and recital in major music venues and with famous orchestras throughout the United States and Europe between 1925 and 1965. Although offered roles with many important European opera companies, Anderson declined, as she had no training in acting. She preferred to perform in concert and recital only. She did, however, perform opera arias within her concerts and recitals. She made many recordings that reflected her broad performance repertoire of everything from concert literature to lieder to opera to traditional American songs and spirituals. Between 1940 and 1965 the German-American pianist Franz Rupp was her permanent accompanist.|$|E
2500|$|Eight Step Rail {{reached the}} ARIA Singles Chart Top50 in the {{following}} February. Its feature track, [...] "Shut My Eyes", received high rotation on national youth radio station, Triple J – it was listed at No.81 on the station's Hottest 100 for 1996. AllMusic's Jonathan Lewis described how [...] "their wall of guitar noise (somewhat reminiscent of Siamese Dream-era Smashing Pumpkins) made them an overnight success on Australian radio. Sounding {{like a cross between}} Liz Phair and Catatonia's Cerys Matthews, McLeod's <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> major drawcard; strong, confident and rarely lapsing into the girlishness that characterized some of the Superjesus' contemporaries." [...] Jasper Cooper of Oz Music Project felt that on the EP, [...] "Musically, the band inherited much from contemporaries such as the Smashing Pumpkins, but McLeod's appeal at the band's fore, lent The Superjesus their own niche and stature. The single track 'Shut My Eyes' was the band's tour de force, something that was still unmatched in their latter albums." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, {{a second}} {{independent}} album, Little Ol' Cowgirl, moved towards a more contemporary country sound, {{as the band}} {{enlisted the help of}} more sidemen, and developed a richer sound with larger and more modern arrangements. Robin Lynn Macy was not pleased with their change in sound, however. She left in late 1992 to devote herself to a [...] "purer" [...] bluegrass sound, remaining active in the Dallas and Austin music scenes. It was during this period that professional steel guitarist Lloyd Maines (who had played on both albums) introduced them to his daughter, Natalie, an aspiring singer. [...] Lloyd Maines thought his daughter would be [...] a good match to replace the departed Macy, and had passed along Natalie's audition demo tape, which had won her a full scholarship to the Berklee College of Music, to both Maguire and Robison. Her distinctive <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> match for Maguire's soprano and Robison's alto harmonies.

2500|$|Rostam Batmanglij was a prior fan of Jepsen's {{work when}} {{he reached out to}} her in the summer of 2014, after {{learning}} that she was in Los Angeles writing with various people. Jepsen was [...] "over the moon" [...] and the pair developed [...] "Warm Blood" [...] until March 2015, the first verse recorded as Jepsen sat on the carpet of Batmanglij's home studio. Batmanglij announced the track's existence via Twitter on April 29, 2015. The song has been noted for its experimental vocal effects, with Batmanglij scattering distorted vocal cuts throughout, a [...] "creepy" [...] quality that the pair immediately liked. Elsewhere, sections of [...] "Warm Blood" [...] were sung in a lower pitch: [...] "I had shown up one day, and my <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little shot. The idea was that I would come back and sing it 'properly' once I’d recovered, but we ended up getting married to how it sounded since my voice was kind of smokier, so we kept it."

2500|$|Regarding {{the sheer}} size of Callas's instrument, Celletti says, [...] "Her voice was penetrating. The volume as such was average: neither small nor powerful. But the penetration, allied to this incisive quality (which bordered on the ugly because it {{frequently}} contained an element of harshness) ensured that her voice could be clearly heard anywhere in the auditorium." [...] Rodolfo Celletti wrote that Callas had [...] "a voluminous, penetrating, and dark voice" [...] ("una voce voluminosa, squillante e di timbro scuro"). After her first performance of Medea in 1953, the critic for Musical Courier wrote that [...] "she displayed a vocal generosity that was scarcely believable for its amplitude and resilience." [...] In a 1982 Opera News interview with Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge, Bonynge stated, [...] "But before she slimmed down, I mean this was such a colossal voice. It just poured out of her, the way Flagstad's did.... Callas had a huge voice. When she and Stignani sang Norma, {{at the bottom of the}} range you could barely tell who was who ... Oh it was colossal. And she took the big sound right up to the top." [...] In his book, Michael Scott makes the distinction that whereas Callas's pre-1954 <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "dramatic soprano with an exceptional top", after the weight loss, it became, as one Chicago critic described the voice in Lucia, a [...] "huge soprano leggiero".|$|E
