This paper investigates a number of issues relating to aggregation of capital utilization measures from the Survey of Plant Capacity and makes recommendations on expanding and improving the published statistics deriving from the Survey of Plant Capacity. The paper documents a number of facts about properties of capital utilization. First, after growing for decades, capital utilization started to fall in mid 1990 s. Second, capital utilization is a useful predictor of changes in capacity utilization and other factors of production. Third, adjustment of productivity measures for variable capital utilization improves statistical and economic properties of these measures. Fourth, the paper constructs weights to aggregate firm level capital utilization rates to industry and economy level, which is the major enhancement to available data. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{quantitative}} implications of two business cycle models in which aggregate fluctuations arise {{in response to}} variations {{in the process of}} financial intermediation. In the first, fundamental shocks in the capital accumulation process lead to fluctuations in the real returns from intermediated investment. For this economy, we find that the correlations produced are not consistent with observations of the U. S. economy. In particular, consumption is not smoother than output, investment is negatively correlated with output, variations in the capital stock are quite large and interest rates are procyclical. In an economy with both intermediation and total factor productivity shocks, the correlations we produce are closer to those observed in the U. S. economy only when the intermediation shock is relatively unimportant. In the second economy, variations in the returns to intermediation are part of a sunspot equilibrium. Fluctuations here are driven by self-fulfilling beliefs by private agents regarding the returns to intermediation as in an economy beset by banking crises. For this non-linear economy, we find that the correlations are closer to those observed but the <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> relative to output is still too large. ...|$|E

We emphasize the impact of financial crises on the learning process. The learning model developed in the paper explains more than 90 % of the <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> account policies. We find that over time beliefs about the growth effects have changed slowly and not smoothly from negative to positive. However, at the outset of the Great Recession beliefs on the positive growth dividends from capital account liberalization were still affected by a significant degree of uncertainty, which suggests that reversals in external liberalizations in the aftermath of the Great Recession are consistent with rational learning by policymakers. Finally, in evaluating the potential benefits and costs of capital controls in a given set of countries, contagion effects through changing beliefs of other countries should be taken into account...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{concepts}} like social capital, civic society, and collective action knew a huge popularity, especially {{due to the}} particular contribution {{that they may have}} as tools for or part of social development.

This paper takes the Changbai Mountain Natural Reserve (CMNR) in Northeastern China as a case to investigate the temporal-spatial <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> ecological <b>capital</b> <b>of</b> natural reserves. The method of Specifications for Assessment of Forest Ecosystem Service in China (LY/T 1721 - 2008) was employed to quantify multiple ecosystem services in the CMNR from 1985 to 2010. Considering the particular requirements of forest ecosystem services {{and the availability of}} relevant basic data in the CMNR, this study selected four ecosystem services for 1985, 1997 and 2010 land-use/land-cover conditions: carbon fixation and oxygen release, soil conservation, water conservation and nutrient accumulation. The results show a mix of increases in services (carbon fixation and oxygen release, nutrient accumulation) and decreases in services (water conservation and soil conservation) from 1985 to 2010. Furthermore, we combined quantified and modeled ecosystem services to generate a suite of indices to identify ecosystem services and land-use/land-cover type that need to be targeted for conservation and mitigation. Our assessment can be used by land managers and policy makers in exploring multiple management scenarios and their implications for ecosystem services in natural reserves. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Regional capital expenditures, which reflect {{regional}} flows <b>of</b> financial <b>capital,</b> are {{a function}} of the aggregate of individual firms' behavior. Hence, the allocational efficiency of the regional flows <b>of</b> financial <b>capital</b> may be affected by the manner [...] internal versus external [...] in which financial capital becomes available to manufacturing firms. Allocational inefficiency (sub-optimal allocation <b>of</b> financial <b>capital)</b> could obtain since corporate retained earnings - the amount of funds that are internally available to large firms - are only minimally subject to the market rationing process. Even though the capital market is cleared, it may do so without providing for the efficient allocation <b>of</b> financial <b>capital.</b> The existence <b>of</b> differential rates in regional financial markets may reflect the costs {{associated with the use of}} funds in a truncated or discontinuous national capital market. Accordingly, equilibrium experienced in the capital market may exist under non- Paretian conditions. This paper attempts to determine whether the allocation <b>of</b> regional financial <b>capital</b> flows is efficient as suggested by the neoclassical model (NCM). Specifically, the study attempts to ascertain whether corporate retained earnings model (CREM) is a better predictor of the regional flow <b>of</b> financial <b>capital</b> than the NCM. In accordance with the NCM, for the period under study, it is hypothesized that: regions with high rates of return are regions with high growth rates of corporate income that experience lower <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> annual <b>capital</b> investments than regions with low rates of return. In accordance with the CREM, it is postulated that regions with high average annual capital investment-output ratios are regions with high corporate income and low average rates of return on corporate assets. Surrogate measures <b>of</b> financial <b>capital</b> flows and the volatility of such flows were used. The test results, which may not be generalizable beyond the study period, suggest that the CREM may be a better predictor of the regional flow <b>of</b> financial <b>capital</b> than the NCM and that the financial capital rationing process for regional manufacturing investments may be inefficient. The finding, that the corporate earnings retention influences the flow <b>of</b> financial <b>capital,</b> does suggest that the NCM does not always hold.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} stock repurchases. Chapter 1 {{begins the}} study by discussing and testing several possible motivations for stock buy backs, including firm undervaluation, changes in firm capital structure, expropriation from debtholders, distribution of free cash flow, and signalling informed insiders' asymmetric information to the market. Empirical tests of these hypothesized motivations are consistent with undervaluation and signalling reductions in firm risk, but inconsistent with the capital structure, expropriation, and free cash flow hypotheses. The remainder of the thesis focuses on the determinants of repurchase premiums. Chapter 2 begins {{with a discussion of}} the mechanics of share repurchase, before developing two competing hypotheses regarding repurchase premiums. The first is the liquidity hypothesis, which posits that supply curves for shares are perfectly elastic, and repurchase premiums are a function of the substitutability and liquidity of the stock. The heterogeneity hypothesis, in contrast, holds that supply curves for shares are upward-sloping, and repurchase premiums are a function of any factor that affects either the slope of the supply curve or the demand for shares along the supply curve. Chapter 2 concludes by developing a formal model of repurchase premiums, for use in empirical tests of the alternative hypotheses, which are conducted in Chapter 3. Results of these tests are inconsistent with the liquidity hypothesis, as repurchase premiums are not found to be a function of substitutability or liquidity. Repurchase premiums, however, are consistent with the heterogeneity hypothesis, as they are found to be a significant function <b>of</b> the <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> stockholder consensus about the stock, and the <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>capital</b> gains tax lock-in effect between shareholders...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{interaction}} between taxation and corporate finance decisions has been widely studied, empirical findings show conflicting results so far. Different outcomes may be ascribed to differences in the theoretical models, {{in the definition of}} the variables of interest, in the source <b>of</b> <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> data (across firms and over time), and in the econometric methods. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the relationship between fiscal variables and corporate debt choices by tackling any cause of differences listed above. We can do this thanks to the availability of a large and very detailed data-set on Italian manufacturing companies over a long period with quite a lot of changes in the tax legislation. We find that both the relative price of debt and equity finance (the trade-off fiscal effect) and the net-of-tax cash flow (the pecking-order fiscal effect) are significant and robust ways through which corporate taxation affects financing decisions. Non-debt tax shields (another trade-off fiscal effect) are also important in explaining borrowing. The time dimension of data plays a substantial role in modelling the dynamic relationships and in giving <b>variability</b> to cost <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> data.

40|$|Credibility and {{transparency}} {{are at the}} core of the current debate about exchange rate regimes. The steady growth in the magnitude and <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> international <b>capital</b> flows has complicated the question of whether to use floating, fixed, or intermediate exchange rate regimes. Emerging market economies are abandoning basket pegs, crawling pegs, bands, adjustable pegs, and various combinations of these. One of several reasons intermediate regimes have fallen out of favor is that they are not transparent; it is very difficult to verify them. Verifiability is a concrete example of the principle of"transparency"so often invoked in discussions of the new international financial architecture but so seldom made precise. A simple peg or a simple float may be easier for market participants to verify than a more complicated intermediate regime. The authors investigate how difficult it is for investors to verify from observable data whether the authorities are in fact following the exchange rate regime they claim to be following. Of the various intermediate regimes, they focus on basket pegs with bands. Statistically, it can take a surprisingly long span of data for an econometrician or investor to verify whether such a regime is actually in operation. The authors find that verification becomes more difficult as the regime's bands widen or more currencies enter the basket peg. At the other extreme, they also analyze regimes described as the regime's bands widen or more currencies enter the basket peg. At the other extreme, they also analyze regimes described as free floating and find that in some cases the observed exchange rate data do validate the announced regime.

I discuss how capital depreciation is related to the net-to-gross investment ratio (NGIR), and how both variables are related to the level of industrialization of an economy and to technological progress. I perform this analysis in two steps. First, I use cross-section data to contrast characteristics between industrialized and developing countries, in terms of depreciation, NGIR, and per capita output. Second, I use time-series data of an industrialized country to analyze how technological progress affects and per capita output affects capital depreciation and NGIR. ^ For the time-series analysis, I estimate technological progress (a Solow residual), and develop an error-correction model to analyze the long-run behavior of the NGIR, the real per capita GDP, and the total factor productivity. ^ In the cross sectional analysis I find that higher depreciation rates and lower NGIR are associated to higher per capita output. In the time-series analysis I confirm the results from the cross-section analysis, and I find a positive relationship between the stock of knowledge index and the real GDP per capita, and a negative relationship between the stock of knowledge and the NGIR.

The experiences suggest that as countries become more integrated with international financial markets, there is little room to regulate capital flows effectively. The most effective ways to deal with capital inflows would be to deepen the financial markets, strengthen financial system supervision and regulation, where needed, and improve the capacity to design and implement sound macroeconomic and financial sector policies.
