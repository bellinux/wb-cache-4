50|$|<b>Venezuelan</b> <b>equine</b> {{encephalitis}} {{virus is}} a mosquito-borne viral pathogen that causes <b>Venezuelan</b> <b>equine</b> encephalitis or <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (VEE). VEE can affect all equine species, such as horses, donkeys, and zebras. After infection, equines may suddenly die or show progressive {{central nervous system}} disorders. Humans also can contract this disease. Healthy adults who become infected by the virus may experience flu-like symptoms, such as high fevers and headaches. People with weakened immune systems and {{the young and the}} elderly can become severely ill or die from this disease.|$|R

40|$|Live {{animal trade}} is {{considered}} a major mode of introduction of viruses from enzootic foci into disease-free areas. Due to societal and behavioural changes, some wild animal species may nowadays be considered as pet species. The species diversity of animals involved in international trade is thus increasing. This could benefit pathogens that have a broad host range such as arboviruses. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the risk posed by live animal imports for the introduction, in the European Union (EU), of four arboviruses that affect human and horses: Eastern and Western <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis,</b> <b>Venezuelan</b> <b>equine</b> encephalitis and Japanese encephalitis. Importation data for a five-years period (2005 - 2009, extracted from the EU TRACES database), environmental data (used as a proxy for the presence of vectors) and horses and human population density data (impacting the occurrence of clinical cases) were combined to derive spatially explicit risk indicators for virus introduction and for the potential consequences of such introductions. Results showed the existence of hotspots where the introduction risk was the highest in Belgium, in the Netherlands and in the north of Italy. This risk was higher for Eastern <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (EEE) than for the three other diseases. It was mainly attributed to exotic pet species such as rodents, reptiles or cage birds, imported in small-sized containments from a wide variety of geographic origins. The increasing species and origin diversity of these animals may have in the future a strong impact on the risk of introduction of arboviruses in the EU. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Eastern, Western, and <b>Venezuelan</b> <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> are mosquito-borne, viral {{infections that}} can cause severe {{encephalitis}} in horses and humans.

Interviews with horse owners were conducted along roads selected at random in the counties of Santa Cruz and Yuma, Ariz., and in Dona Ana County, N. Mex. At least 450 horse owners in each county were asked about the vaccination status of their animals, and information was taken on 1, 260 animals.

Serum samples were collected from 446 equines in the 3 -county area; only 227 (50. 7 percent) had both a history of VEE vaccination in 1971 (including 20 vaccinated in 1972) and serum neutralization antibody against VEE. Of the remaining 220 with no detectable neutralization antibody to VEE, 197 (89. 5 percent) had a history of VEE vaccination in 1971 (including 5 revaccinated in 1972), 14 (6. 4 percent) had no history of vaccination, and 9 (4. 1 percent) had an unknown vaccination status. Eighty-two percent (160 of 1971) of the equines with a history of VEE vaccination and presence of dectectable WEE or EEE antibodies, or both, had no detectable levels of VEE antibody.

40|$|Abstract. Virus {{envelope}} proteins are {{the primary}} targets of neutralizing antibody responses. The epitopes recog-nized differ sufficiently between virus subtypes and species to distinguish viruses and provide an important basis for disease diagnosis. <b>Venezuelan</b> <b>equine</b> encephalitis virus (VEEV) causes acute febrile illness in humans and has high mortality in equines. The most specific detection methods for serum antibodies use live virus in neutralization assays or in blocking enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. However, work with <b>Venezuelan</b> <b>equine</b> encephalitis virus requires biosafety level 3 containment and select agent security in the United States. We report two new assays for detection of <b>Venezuelan</b> <b>equine</b> encephalitis virus neutralizing antibody responses, based on virus pseudotypes. The first provides detection by marker gene expression after 20 hours and is particularly suited for high-throughput screening; the second uses a new, rapid virus entry assay to give readouts within 1 hour. Both assays are safe, sensitive, and in general recapitulate neutralizing antibody titers obtained by conventional plaque reduction assays. Each is suitable as a rapid primary screen for detection of neutralizing antibodies against <b>Venezuelan</b> <b>equine</b> encephalitis virus...|$|R
40|$|The {{action on}} mice of several {{neurotropic}} viruses was studied {{with reference to}} factors which influence infection. With pseudorabies virus, section of the sciatic nerve with inoculation into the ipsilateral foot pad significantly retarded the speed of infection. The virus ascended other nerves of the leg, but at a slower rate. It {{would appear that the}} number of nerve fibers available for passage may play a rôle in the speed with which infection occurs with this virus. When pseudorabies virus was inoculated into an area of inflammation its effects were markedly lessened. Similar experiments with unmodified <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus which, unlike pseudorabies, does not ascend along local nerves, showed no impedance of infection. Brain trauma did not change the rate of infection with the viruses of St. Louis encephalitis, herpes, or pseudorabies. But intraperitoneal injection of glycerine, followed by intramuscular inoculation of St. Louis virus, resulted in marked facilitation of infection, as already remarked of fixed <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus. This phenomenon did not occur with pseudorabies or herpes. In contrast to certain other viruses, pseudorabies and herpes viruses were only slightly more effective in young mice than in adults. With St. Louis virus, as with fixed <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> viruses, inoculation into the eye or nose was far more effective than other peripheral routes. This was not the case with pseudorabies. Herpes, however, also showed greater sensitivity of the intraocular route. After injection into the eye, St. Louis and fixed <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> viruses invaded the optic pathway, while herpes and pseudorabies avoided the optic fibers and attacked the trigeminal nerve. These phenomena are discussed in the light of cellufugal and cellupetal progression of viruses. The similarities in the action of fixed <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> and St. Louis encephalitis viruses are discussed and contrasted with herpes and pseudorabies...|$|R

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of sublethal, acute, total-body irradiation (600 R) on the immune response of mice to a replicating antigen.

Development of protective immunity was studied by inoculating subgroups of irradiated mice with virulent <b>Venezuelan</b> <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus on days 1 through 28 after immunization. Irradiation failed to affect the overt clinical response of mice inoculated with the attenuated strain, but antibody responses and the onset of protective immunity was delayed, particularly in mice irradiated 2 h to 3 days prior to vaccination. Immunity afforded by TC- 83 developed more rapidly as the interval between irradiation and vaccination increased: when this interval was 14 or more days, the temporal course of immune response in irradiated mice was similar to that of nonirradiated vaccines. Persistence of TC- 83 viremia was greatly prolonged in irradiated mice through the irradiation recovery period and probably provided the antigenic stimulus responsible for delayed development of effective immunity...|$|E
