40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the reduction of plastic bag usage at supermarkets. Many behaviors leading to potential damage to the environment may be unintentional. This study applied a dual motivation model to plastic bag usage and examined the effects of an intervention aimed at promoting pro-environmental behavior. A <b>voice</b> <b>prompt</b> intervention was implemented in Japanese supermarkets. In the first (control) week, shoppers were given free plastic bags by the cashier. In the second (intervention) week, cashiers asked shoppers whether they wanted plastic bags. We collected observational and questionnaire measures of variables that predicted free plastic bag usage during the intervention. The results supported a dual motivation model of behavioral change. The <b>voice</b> <b>prompt</b> decreased the usage of plastic bags by both discouraging unintentional usage and encouraging an intentional reduction in usage. Possibilities for interventions designed both to attenuate unintentional motivation and to promote intentional motivation are considered...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis work {{examined}} the effects of using in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) on drivers by on-road test and simulator experiment. Twelve participants participated in the test. In on-road test, drivers performed driving task with <b>voice</b> <b>prompt</b> and non-voice prompt navigation device mounted on different position. In simulator experiment, secondary tasks, including cognitive, visual and manual tasks, were performed in a driving simulator. Subjective rating was used to test mental workload of drivers in on-road test and simulator experiment. The impact of task complexity and reaction mode was investigated in this paper. The results of the test and the simulation showed that position 1 was more comfortable than other two positions for drivers and it would cause less mental load. Drivers tend to support this result in subjective rating. IVIS with <b>voice</b> <b>prompt</b> causes less visual demand to drivers. The mental load will grow as the difficulty of the task increasing. The cognitive task on manual reaction causes higher mental load than cognitive task which doesn’t require manual reaction. These results may have practical implications for in-vehicle information system design...|$|E

40|$|Driving is a {{challenging}} task {{because of the}} physical, attentional, and emotional demands. When drivers become frustrated by events their negative emotional state can escalate dangerously. This study examines behavioral and attitudinal effects of cognitively reframing frustrating events. Participants (N = 36) were asked to navigate {{a challenging}} driving course that included frustrating events such as long lights and being cut-off. Drivers {{were randomly assigned to}} three conditions. After encountering a frustrating event, drivers in a reappraisal-down condition heard <b>voice</b> <b>prompts</b> that reappraised the event in an effort to deflate negative reactions. Drivers in the second group, reappraisal-up, heard <b>voice</b> <b>prompts</b> that brought attention to the negative actions of vehicles and pedestrians. Drivers in a silent condition drove without hearing any <b>voice</b> <b>prompts.</b> Participants in the reappraisal-down condition had better driving behavior and reported less negative emotions than participants in the other conditions.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{tries to}} find the {{designing}} blind spots of the <b>voice</b> <b>prompt</b> function in the current car navigation systems and make improvement sugges-tions. The experimental plan was implemented through videotape analysis of the voice-prompt mode, referring to Urban Road Classification Regulations and the questionnaire survey results. Driving simulation tests were conducted with 15 experimental subjects, 13 road combinations, and 3 running speeds, and dif-ferent prompt modes which were run synchronously were also included. Com-pared with the present mode (prompt time is determined by distance.), the newly-designed mode (prompt time is determined by running speed.) signifi-cantly improved driving performance and reduced mental workload. When driving on a main artery with fast lanes and slow lanes, adding a changing-lane prompt with a clear sound to the system can help increasing the driving accuracy rate...|$|E
40|$|In earlier work, we {{proposed}} a <b>voice</b> <b>prompt</b> suppression (VPS) algorithm based on a Kalman filter, in which the temporal update or correction step is performed in information space. The advantage {{of this approach is}} that the information matrix can be diagonally loaded in order to control the magnitude of the subband filter coefficients, which provides for better robustness. In this work, we extend that earlier work by proposing a square root implementation of the information filter VPS algorithm, as well as a technique for diagonally loading the Cholesky factor of the error covariance matrix used in this implementation. We also investigate the effectiveness of cascading VPS after maximum kurtosis beamforming, which has been shown to provide performance superior to all conventional beamforming techniques. In a set of distant speech recognition experiments we demonstrate that VPS can reduce word error rate from 19. 9 % to 16. 1 % for an adult speaker, and from 44. 4 % to 40. 0 % for a child.

40|$|What does a never-employed here, but out-of-funds {{mechanical}} engineer from Bangladesh desperately looking for sustenance write on his resume for a dish-washing job? ” (Khan 2002, p. 4) The question posed by Akbar Khan {{in his letter}} to the editor of a local community paper poignantly highlights the experience many immigrant professionals face in trying to employ their skills and expertise in Canada’s labour market. Since the introduction of the point system in 1967, hundreds of thousands of immigrants have been recruited to Canada for their skills. Canada’s inability to effectively integrate immigrants into the labour market is of increasing economic and social concern. Despite our dependence on immigration for labour market growth, studies repeatedly highlight the increasing marginalization and poverty of immigrants. In order to facilitate the effective integration of immigrants, innovative approaches and partnerships are essential to cut across the complexity of jurisdictions and intransigence of stakeholders. The voice of immigrant professionals and tradespeople is integral to these partnerships and to the development of solutions. In Ontario, the Policy Roundtable Mobilizing Professions and Trades (PROMPT) has been formed to provide that <b>voice.</b> <b>PROMPT</b> is made up of 20 immigrant professional and trade associations, community initiatives...|$|E

40|$|AIM This study aims {{to compare}} the effect of three CPR prompt and {{feedback}} devices on quality of chest compressions amongst healthcare providers. METHODS A single blinded, randomised controlled trial compared a pressure sensor/metronome device (CPREzy), an accelerometer device (Phillips Q-CPR) and simple metronome {{on the quality of}} chest compressions on a manikin by trained rescuers. The primary outcome was compression depth. Secondary outcomes were compression rate, proportion of chest compressions with inadequate depth, incomplete release and user satisfaction. RESULTS The pressure sensor device improved compression depth (37. 24 - 43. 64 mm, p= 0. 02), the accelerometer device decreased chest compression depth (37. 38 - 33. 19 mm, p= 0. 04) whilst the metronome had no effect (39. 88 mm vs. 40. 64 mm, p= 0. 802). Compression rate fell with all devices (pressure sensor device 114. 68 - 98. 84 min(- 1), p= 0. 001, accelerometer 112. 04 - 102. 92 min(- 1), p= 0. 072 and metronome 108. 24 min(- 1) vs. 99. 36 min(- 1), p= 0. 009). The pressure sensor feedback device reduced the proportion of compressions with inadequate depth (0. 52 vs. 0. 24, p= 0. 013) whilst the accelerometer device and metronome did not have a statistically significant effect. Incomplete release of compressions was common, but unaffected by the CPR feedback devices. Users preferred the accelerometer and metronome devices over the pressure sensor device. A post hoc study showed that de-activating the <b>voice</b> <b>prompt</b> on the accelerometer device prevented the deterioration in compression quality seen in the main study. CONCLUSION CPR feedback devices vary in their ability to improve performance. In this study the pressure sensor device improved compression depth, whilst the accelerometer device reduced it and metronome had no effect...|$|E
