5|$|While {{designing}} the Creighton-Ward Mansion sets, Bell {{and his staff}} strove for authenticity, ordering miniature Tudor paintings, -scale Georgian- and Regency-style furniture and carpeting {{in the shape of}} a polar bear skin. This realism was enhanced by adding scrap items acquired from household waste and electronics shops. For example, a <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> pipe serves as Virgil Tracy's launch chute.|$|E

Three Plasser & Theurer track tamping machines were purchased in 1980, and two Unimog road-rail vehicles were obtained in 1983 and 1986, for use as depot shunters.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{attended}} Lafayette High School in Lexington, {{where he}} was a seventeen-time letterman in various sports. During one summer, his father expressed disappointment that he had decided to spend the summer selling vacuum cleaners instead of working on a road construction crew {{with the rest of his}} football teammates. Motivated by his father's disapproval, Brown averaged $1,000 in monthly commissions from <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> sales. After high school, Brown matriculated to the University of Kentucky, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1957 and a law degree in 1960. While in law school, he made as much as $25,000 a year selling Encyclopædia Britannica sets, and employed a sales crew made up of classmates to increase his profits.|$|E

5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{dreams of}} a red light that leads him to the corpse {{of a young girl}} buried in a park in Manassas, Virginia. When he awakens, he heads to the park and finds the girl's skeleton. The girl was {{determined}} to have been murdered by John Lee Roche (Tom Noonan), a serial killer who murdered thirteen girls throughout the 1980s; his modus operandi was cutting a heart out of the clothes of each victim. Mulder had captured Roche by deducing that he committed the murders while traveling as a <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> salesman. Roche's hearts were never found, although he confessed to all of the murders.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} plan for Luigi's Mansion involved a game where the levels revolved {{around a large}} mansion or complex. Tests were later done with Mario characters in dollhouses and such. Once it was transitioned into a GameCube project, Luigi {{was selected as the}} main character {{in order to keep the}} game original and new. The other gameplay ideas, such as ghosts and the ghost-sucking <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> were added later. Older concepts, such as a role-playing game-like system which made real-time changes to rooms, as well as an underground cave area located under the mansion, were also scrapped due to the inclusion of the new ideas.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Brooklyn Preparatory, a Jesuit school, on {{a scholarship}} and graduated as class valedictorian in 1946.

Those years at Georgetown were probably {{the best years of}} my life, Blatty said in 2015. Until then, I’d never had a home. While studying for his master's degree at George Washington University, Blatty took menial jobs. Initially unable to find a job in teaching, he worked as a <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> door-to-door salesman, a beer truck driver, and as a United Airlines ticket agent. He earned his master's in English literature from the George Washington University in 1954. He then enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he ultimately became head of the Policy Branch of the USAF Psychological Warfare Division.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter {{has been}} called the Solar System's <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> because of its immense gravity well and {{location}} near the inner Solar System. It receives the most frequent comet impacts of the Solar System's planets. It was thought that the planet served to partially shield the inner system from cometary bombardment. However, recent computer simulations suggest that Jupiter does not cause a net {{decrease in the number of}} comets that pass through the inner Solar System, as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them. This topic remains controversial among scientists, as some think it draws comets towards Earth from the Kuiper belt while others think that Jupiter protects Earth from the alleged Oort cloud. Jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Luigi having won a mansion in a contest. Despite not having entered any contest, he {{promptly}} told Mario about the mansion, {{and the two}} agreed to meet up outside it that evening. Luigi takes a flashlight {{with him and he}} follows the map to the mansion. Upon finally arriving at his new mansion, which looks much more sinister than the supplied photo, Mario is nowhere to be found. Luigi proceeds inside the mansion, entering the Parlor after he gains the key from a strange ghost-like shape. Upon entry, he is soon assaulted by a Gold Ghost, only to be saved by a little old man wielding a <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b> The old man, however, is unable to reel in the ghost and is soon overpowered. After being helped to his feet by Luigi, the old man introduces himself as Professor Elvin Gadd. The two retreat from the mansion when more of the Gold Ghosts appear.|$|E
5|$|Important for the {{adoption}} of the style {{in the early nineteenth century}} was Abbotsford House, the residence of the novelist and poet, Sir Walter Scott. Re-built for him from 1816, it became a model for the modern revival of the baronial style. Common features borrowed from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century houses included battlemented gateways, crow-stepped gables, pointed turrets and machicolations. The style was popular across Scotland and was applied to relatively modest dwellings by architects such as William Burn (1789–1870), David Bryce (1803–76), Edward Blore (1787–1879), Edward Calvert (c. 1847–1914) and Robert Stodart Lorimer (1864–1929). The publication of Robert Billings' Baronial and Ecclesiastical Architecture of Scotland (1848–52) provided a handbook for the style and the rebuilding of Balmoral Castle as a baronial palace (and subsequent adoption as a royal retreat from 1855–58) confirmed its popularity. Estate house building boomed between about 1855 and the agricultural depression and Glasgow Bank crash of 1878. Construction was now dominated by patronage from nouveau riche industrialists. The decline in numbers of servants, linked to the introduction of electricity, central heating and labour-saving devices such as the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> also led to changes in the scale of building. Arts and crafts designs first featured in Philip Webb's (1831–1915) gothic design at Arisaig (1863–64). It was pursed by William Lethaby at Melsetter House, Hoy (1898) for a Birmingham industrialist.|$|E

25|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> uses {{a partial}} vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors. Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented the first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper {{instead of a}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> his machine did, in fact, have a {{rotating}} brush like a traditional <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism {{on top of the}} body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> on July 10, 1860. Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the first electric <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who invented the motorized <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1899. However, neither were practical or useful. The first practical and portable <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> was built in 1907, when James Murray Spangler, a janitor from Canton, Ohio, incorporated a rotating brush, an electric fan, a box, and one of his wife's pillowcases to serve as the dust bag.|$|E
25|$|A {{rotating}} slotted nozzle {{inside the}} sieving chamber {{and a powerful}} industrial <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> which {{is connected to the}} chamber. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> generates a vacuum inside the sieving chamber and sucks in fresh air through the slotted nozzle. When passing the narrow slit of the nozzle the air stream is accelerated and blown against the sieve mesh, dispersing the particles. Above the mesh, the air jet is distributed over the complete sieve surface and is sucked in with low speed through the sieve mesh. Thus the finer particles are transported through the mesh openings into the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b>|$|E
