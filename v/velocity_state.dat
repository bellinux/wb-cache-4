40|$|We present {{switching}} current measurements in niobium-aluminum oxide-niobium underdamped Josephson rings. Underdamped Josephson rings display hysteretic current-voltage curves {{which can be}} characterized by their {{switching current}}, the value of applied current at which the junctions switch to the energy-gap voltage. The value of the switching current is strongly affected by temperature and {{by the presence of}} fluxons in the system. We observe a very small voltage (0. 2 nV) across the ring prior to switching, indicating a low-velocity fluxon diffusion state before the jump to a full running state. In analogy with previous work on single junctions, we analyze the switching current data with the process of thermal activation over a dissipation barrier, where the system switches from a low <b>velocity</b> <b>state</b> to a high <b>velocity</b> <b>state.</b> We find that our data agrees qualitatively with this description, further supporting the observation of fluxon diffusion.

The MRAC problem is cast into the Structured MRAC problem as the kinematic differential equations are exactly known and all the learning is restricted to the acceleration differential equations. Earlier work in this area considered the number of actuators to be equal to the number of <b>velocity</b> <b>states.</b> A class of problems wherein, the number of actuators are less than the <b>velocity</b> <b>states</b> is addressed here and the control laws are designed to ensure global stability and bounded tracking. It can be proved in theory that, the present case could be cast into a structure that seeks to drive the controls by minimizing the tracking errors in a least squares sense.

40|$|Robust {{adaptive}} control of underwater vehicles in 6 DOF is analysed {{in the context}} of measurement noise. The performance of the {{adaptive control}} laws of Sadegh and Harowitz (1990) and Slotine and Benedetto (1990) are compared. Both these schemes require that all states are measured, that is the velocities and positions in surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch and yaw. However, for underwater vehicles it is difficult to measure the linear velocities whereas angular velocity measurements can be obtained by using a 3 axes angular rate sensor. This problem is addressed by designing a nonlinear observer for linear <b>velocity</b> <b>state</b> estimation. The proposed observer requires that the position and the attitude are measured, e. g. by using a hydroacoustic positioning system for linear positions, two gyros for roll and pitch and a compass for yaw. In addition angular rate measurements will be assumed available from a 3 -axes rate sensor or a state estimator. It is also assumed that the measurement rate is limited to 2 Hz for all the sensors. Simulation studies with a 3 DOF AUV model are used to demonstrate the convergence and robustness of the adaptive control laws and the <b>velocity</b> <b>state</b> observer...|$|E

40|$|Neurofilaments are transported along axons in {{the slow}} {{component}} of axonal transport. The average rate of movement is generally quoted as several millimeters or tenths of a millimeter per day, but this rate is known to decrease while the neurofilaments are in transit due to spatial and temporal factors that are not understood. We have previously presented a stochastic model for neurofilament movement in vivo based on the transport kinetics of single neurofilaments observed by time-lapse fluorescence imaging in cultured neurons. The model took into account multiple <b>velocity</b> <b>states</b> and was only accessible through computational simulations. In simulations of the movement of a pulse of radiolabeled neurofilaments, this model generated a Gaussian wave which closely matched the experimental data.

We show that the transport wave can be fully described by the mean and variance and we present analytical solutions for these cumulants {{in terms of the}} kinetic parameters of the model.

40|$|Abstract. We {{establish}} {{the existence and}} stability of multidimensional steady transonic flows with transonic shocks through an infinite nozzle of arbitrary cross-sections, including a slowly varying de Laval nozzle. The transonic flow is governed by the inviscid potential flow equation with supersonic upstream flow at the entrance, uniform subsonic downstream flow at the exit at infinity, and the slip boundary condition on the nozzle boundary. Our results indicate that, if the supersonic upstream flow at the entrance is sufficiently close to a uniform flow, there exists a solution that consists of a C 1,α subsonic flow in the unbounded downstream region, converging to a uniform <b>velocity</b> <b>state</b> at infinity, and a C 1,α multidimensional transonic shock dividing the subsonic flow from the supersonic upstream flow; the uniform <b>velocity</b> <b>state</b> at the exit at infinity in the downstream direction is uniquely determined by the supersonic upstream flow; and the shock is orthogonal to the nozzle boundary at every point of their intersection. In order to construct such a transonic flow, we reformulate the multidimensional transonic nozzle problem into a free boundary problem for the subsonic phase, in which the equation is elliptic and the free boundary is a transonic shock. The free boundary conditions {{are determined by the}} Rankine-Hugoniot conditions along the shock. We further develop a nonlinear iteration approach and employ its advantages to deal with such a free boundary problem in the unbounded domain. We also prove that the transonic flow with a transonic shock is unique and stable with respect to the nozzle boundary and the smooth supersonic upstream flow at the entrance. 1...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Motion of the {{lithosphere}} over a {{low viscosity}} asthenosphere con-centrates shear and thus energy dissipation in the asthenosphere. This heat source warms the asthenosphere and, in extreme circumstances, {{may lead to}} thermal instabilities. The conditions for thermal stability have been investi-gated by Melosh who supposed that constant stress acted on the plate, and by Yuen & Schubert who assumed constant velocity boundary conditions. In this paper we investigate a simple analytical model which behaves qualita-tively like the more complex systems. This model reproduces the results of Melosh for constant stress and of Yuen & Schubert for constant velocity. The velocity-shear stress characteristic curve for this model shows three branches. The stability of solutions on each branch {{is a function of}} the boundary condi-tions, whether constant stress or constant velocity. The simplicity of the model allows us to investigate stability when neither constant stress nor constant velocity apply and to study the structure of the solutions as these limits are approached. A relation between the velocity of a plate and the driving force is constructed. A loading-line analysis specifies the actual stress and velocity of the plate. Although the solutions are unique for many combinations of the loading-line parameters, there is a region of multiple solutions. These solutions exhibit the characteristics of a ‘cusp catastrophe’; both a low velocity and a high <b>velocity</b> <b>state</b> are stable, while an intermediate state is unstable. Continental lithosphere may lie in this region, leading to epirogenic movements when the plate changes its velocity with respect to the mantle.
