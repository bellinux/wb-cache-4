5|$|Genetic {{diversity}} of crops {{can be used}} to help protect the environment. Crop <b>varieties</b> <b>that</b> are resistant to pests and diseases can reduce the need for application of harmfulpesticides.While crops that are more vigorous can better compete withweeds whichreduces the need for applyingherbicides. This is shown in a case study completed atAarhus Universityin Denmark which used more robust maize.Drought resistant plants can help save water and reduce the need forirrigation whiledeeper rooting varieties can help stabilize soils; and <b>varieties</b> <b>that</b> are more efficient in their use of nutrients require lessfertilizer.|$|E

5|$|Dialectologists {{identify}} many English dialects, {{which usually}} refer to regional <b>varieties</b> <b>that</b> differ {{from each other}} in terms of patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate regional accents. The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of British English (BrE) and North American English (NAE). There also exists a third common major grouping of English varieties: Southern Hemisphere English, the most prominent being Australian and New Zealand English.|$|E
5|$|Modern cottage gardens include countless {{regional}} and personal variations and embrace plant materials, such as ornamental grasses or native plants {{not seen in}} the rural gardens of cottagers. Traditional roses, with their full fragrance and lush foliage, {{continue to be a}} cottage-garden mainstay — along with modern disease-resistant <b>varieties</b> <b>that</b> retain traditional attributes. Informal climbing plants, whether traditional or modern hybrids, are also common, as are the self-sowing annuals and freely spreading perennials favoured in traditional cottagers' gardens.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} {{has been}} used for applications in biotechnology and is nearing commercialization in others. RNAi has developed many novel crops such as nicotinefree tobacco, decaffeinated coffee, nutrient fortified and hypoallergenic crops. The genetically engineered Arctic apples received FDA approval in 2015. The apples were produced by RNAi suppression of PPO (polyphenol oxidase) gene making apple <b>varieties</b> <b>that</b> will not undergo browning after being sliced. PPO-silenced apples are unable to convert chlorogenic acid into quinone product.|$|E

50|$|Bubbierasco {{is a red}} Italian {{wine grape}} <b>variety</b> <b>that</b> is grown in the {{province}} of Cuneo in the Piedmont wine region of northwest Italy. The grape is a natural crossing of the Nebbiolo grape, famous for the red wines of Barolo and Barbaresco, and Bianchetta di Saluzzo, a white grape <b>variety</b> <b>that</b> has been historically grown around the town of Saluzzo.|$|R
5|$|In these epochs, she was {{not merely}} {{applying}} ideas and methods of earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions {{that would be used}} by future mathematicians. In particular, she developed a completely new theory of ideals in rings, generalizing earlier work of Richard Dedekind. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions, a simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results in her hands. Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a new perspective, such as elimination theory and the algebraic <b>varieties</b> <b>that</b> had been studied by her father.|$|E
5|$|The Irish Post Office {{has never}} publicised an {{official}} stamp numbering {{system for the}} postage stamps they issued, so collectors use a stamp numbering system {{from one of the}} most popular stamp catalogues, such as Stanley Gibbons, Scott, MacDonnell Whyte, MDW (last edition 1991), Hibernian or Michel. There are differences between these numbering systems that result in a varying sequence of stamps in each listing, with some stamps included on some lists but not on others—usually <b>varieties</b> <b>that</b> the publishers think do not belong in a general catalogue. For instance, Ireland's first postage stamp, the 2d Map of Ireland, issued in 1922 is numbered 68 by Scott, 43 by Michel, D4 by Hibernian and MacDonnell Whyte and 74 by Stanley Gibbons.|$|E
5|$|The {{comparatively}} {{warm and}} sunny climate allows {{species of plants}} to thrive which do not on the mainland. The limestone soil has low nutrient levels; hence smaller species of wild flowers and grasses are able {{to grow in the}} absence of larger species. Portland sea lavender {{can be found on the}} higher sea cliffs—unique to Portland it is one of the United Kingdom's rarest plants. The wild flowers and plants make an excellent habitat for butterflies; over half of the British Isles' 57 butterfly species can be seen on Portland, including <b>varieties</b> <b>that</b> migrate from mainland Europe. Species live on Portland that are rare in the United Kingdom, including the limestone race of the silver-studded blue.|$|E

5|$|The {{rock pigeon}} has been domesticated for {{hundreds}} of years. It has been bred into several varieties kept by hobbyists, of which the best known is the homing pigeon or racing homer. Other popular breeds are tumbling pigeons such as the Birmingham roller, and fancy <b>varieties</b> <b>that</b> are bred for certain physical characteristics such as large feathers on the feet or fan-shaped tails. Domesticated rock pigeons are also bred as carrier pigeons, used {{for thousands of years}} to carry brief written messages, and release doves used in ceremonies. White doves are also commonly used in magic acts.|$|E
5|$|First, {{the waves}} of Norse {{colonisation}} of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with Old Norse, a North Germanic language. Norse influence was strongest in the Northeastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in Scots and Northern English. However the centre of norsified English {{seems to have been}} in the Midlands around Lindsey, and after 920 CE when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, Norse features spread from there into English <b>varieties</b> <b>that</b> had not been in intense contact with Norse speakers. Some elements of Norse influence that persist in all English varieties today are the pronouns beginning with th- (they, them, their) which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with h- (hie, him, hera).|$|E
25|$|<b>Varieties</b> <b>that</b> are {{described}} as having stress, including Isthmus Zapotec, have it on the penultimate syllable of the root. Prefixes and clitics do not affect it. Many varieties overwhelmingly have monosyllabic roots and stress falls on that syllable.|$|E
