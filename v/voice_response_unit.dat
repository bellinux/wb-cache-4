50|$|IVR {{systems can}} be used for mobile purchases, banking {{payments}} and services, retail orders, utilities, travel information and weather conditions. A common misconception refers to an automated attendant as an IVR. The terms are distinct and mean different things to traditional telecommunications professionals—the purpose of an IVR is to take input, process it, and return a result, whereas the job of an automated attendant is to route calls. The term <b>voice</b> <b>response</b> <b>unit</b> (VRU) is sometimes used as well.|$|E

40|$|A (customer) {{contact center}} is a {{collection}} of resources providing an interface between a service provider and its customers. The classical contact {{center is a}} call center, containing a collection of service representatives (reps) who talk to customers over the telephone. In a call center, the service reps are supported by quite elaborate information-and-communication-technology (ICT) equipment, such as a private branch exchange (PBX), an interactive <b>voice</b> <b>response</b> (IVR) <b>unit,</b> an automatic call distributor (ACD), a personal computer (PC) and assorted databases. With the rapid growth of e-commerce, contact between the service provider and its customers if often made via e-mail or the Internet instead of by telephone. Thus the general interface between a service provider and its customers is now often called a contact center. The design and management of contact centers is important, and worthy of research, because contact centers comprise a large, growing part of the economy and because they are quite complicated. Classic call centers are complicated becaus...|$|R
50|$|In telecommunications, {{an audio}} <b>response</b> <b>unit</b> (ARU) is {{a device that}} {{provides}} synthesized <b>voice</b> <b>responses</b> to DTMF keypresses by processing calls based on (a) the call-originator input, (b) information received from a database, and (c) information in the incoming call, such {{as the time of}} day. ARUs increase the number of information calls handled and provide consistent quality in information retrieval.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{planets are}} [...] "guarded" [...] by neutral TEC fleets, who will attack anyone that ventures near; this is {{especially}} true for the aptly-named Pirate Base planets, which are settled by pirates and are heavily fortified. In the game's start-up screen, players can also choose to enable [...] "Pirate Raids". This mechanic allows players to anonymously place [...] "bounty" [...] on other players, with the goal of inducing the pirates to attack that player. The more bounty is placed on another player, then the larger the attacking fleet will be if the pirates choose to attack that player; pirate raids also gain strength over time, and to deal with them, the player has to find all the pirate bases, which are the spawn points for raids in their respective star system, and wipe them out. Pirate forces are, with one exception, TEC frigates, cruisers, orbital defense platforms, and mines (and the only exception still bears a similarity to Trader ships), but they are all unshielded, have heavier armor, often have their armament switched to autocannons, and are heavily customised with spikes and stylized holographic [...] "Jolly Rogers". Rebellion also has <b>voiced</b> <b>responses</b> for pirate <b>units</b> (which can often found in the service of TEC Rebels).|$|R
40|$|Although {{the quality}} of the {{customer}} contact centre is pivotal for services, a thorough conceptualization and operationalization of perceived customer contact centre quality does not exist. The extensive scale development process moves from focus group sessions for item generation to exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Perceived customer contact centre quality consists of seven dimensions: reliability, empathy, customer knowledge, customer focus, waiting cost, user friendliness of the <b>voice</b> <b>response</b> <b>unit,</b> and accessibility.

40|$|A {{call center}} {{is a place where}} a group of agents service {{customers}} remotely via the telephone. Queueing theory is used extensively in the study of call centers. One of the most important statistical models used to predict call arrivals in queueing theory is the Poisson process. This paper summarizes the results of the application of this model in the study of call arrivals to a particular bank. Specifically, the call arrivals to the VRU (<b>Voice</b> <b>Response</b> <b>Unit)</b> and to the service queue are examined. These calls are put through different techniques that test whether the actual data conform to the hypothetical model for a Poisson process. An explanation of each of these tests and the results are described in this paper...|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} developed that improves the efficiency of wind tunnel model leak checking. The program uses a voice recognition unit to relay a technician's commands to the computer. The computer, after receiving a command, can respond to the technician via a <b>voice</b> <b>response</b> <b>unit.</b> Information about the model pressure orifice being checked is displayed on a gas-plasma terminal. On command, the program records up to 30 seconds of pressure data. After the recording is complete, the raw data and a straight line fit of the data are plotted on the terminal. This allows the technician {{to make a decision}} on the integrity of the orifice being checked. All results of the leak check program are stored in a database file that can be listed on the line printer for record keeping purposes or displayed on the terminal to help the technician find unchecked orifices. This program allows one technician to check a model for leaks instead of the two or three previously required...|$|E
40|$|In June, 1999, the University of Nebraska Public Policy Center (PPC) {{was asked}} by the Executive Board of the Nebraska Legislature to {{undertake}} a study of child support issues. Specifically, the PPC was asked to recommend how Nebraska can preserve existing strengths and reduce or eliminate weakness in its child support customer service system as the state complies with a federal mandate and develops a centralized State Disbursement Unit (SDU) for the receipting and disbursement of child support payments. In order to learn about {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the present customer service system in Nebraska, as well as learn what other states are doing to service child support customers, the PPC spent most of its efforts consulting with Nebraska stakeholders (custodial and non-custodial parents; employers; child support enforcement workers, staff and officials; district court clerks; attorneys; policymakers and legislative and gubernatorial staff; judicial personnel; and other interested persons), state and federal child support enforcement staff and other officials from around the nation, leaders and staff from private companies working in child support around the country, and with other national experts. The PPC worked closely with an inter-governmental Work Group, consisting of representatives from the Unicameral, the Nebraska Child Support Enforcement/) IV-D agency, the Governor’s Office, the State Court Administrator’s Office, and the District Court Clerk’s Association. The results of these efforts lead the PPC to offer 10 recommendations that we believe will help preserve existing customer service strengths and reduce or eliminate weaknesses: • Establish an on-going, intergovernmental and key stakeholder team(s) to monitor and participate in the selection, implementation, and on-going evaluation of the customer service system in Nebraska. • Make extensive use of a toll-free, <b>Voice</b> <b>Response</b> <b>Unit</b> (VRU) /automated telephone system with customer service representatives as the primary means of obtaining customer service. • If possible, provide access to a person with whom customers can speak face-to-face for service. • Provide customer services specifically for employers. • Include all child support cases in the new SDU and customer service systems. • Ensure adequate staffing and a sufficient infrastructure to allow customer service providers to succeed, and also slowly implement changes to the current child support system. • Specify performance indicators and conduct customer satisfaction studies. • Make use of new technologies to expand access to information and to allow innovative means for interactions between customers and customer service providers. • Use the upcoming change as an opportunity to develop and expand innovative social programs designed to further the goals of the child support system. • Be patient as the new systems are implemented and be proactive in informing stakeholders of upcoming changes. Along with these 10 recommendations (and an elaboration of the rationales for the recommendations), seven policy decision points are identified and discussed. Five challenges to successful implementation of the SDU-linked customer service system are presented. Finally, we encourage all those involved in the child support system to work together, to move on from past disagreements, and engage in an effective decisionmaking process that will result in positive outcomes for Nebraska’s children and families...|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} with rats examined {{the roles of}} demarcating stimuli and differential reinforcement probability {{on the development of}} functional <b>response</b> <b>units.</b> It examined the development of units in a probabilistic, free-operant situation in which the presence of demarcating stimuli was manipulated. In all conditions, behavior became organized into two-response sequences framed by changes in local reinforcement probability. A tone demarcating {{the beginning and end of}} contingent response sequences facilitated the development of functional <b>response</b> <b>units,</b> as in chunking, but the same units developed slowly in the absence of the tone. Complex functional <b>response</b> <b>units</b> developed even though reinforcement contigencies remained constant. These findings demonstrate that models of operant learning must include a mechanism for changing the <b>response</b> <b>unit</b> as a function of reinforcement history. Markov models may seem to be a natural technique for modeling response sequences because of their ability to predict individual responses as a function of reinforcement history; however, no class of Markov chain can incorporate changing <b>response</b> <b>units</b> in their predictions...|$|R
