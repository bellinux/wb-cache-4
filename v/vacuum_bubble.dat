40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} the {{nucleation}} of <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubbles</b> in the Brans-Dicke type theory of gravity. In the Euclidean signature, we evaluate the fields at the <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubbles</b> as solutions of the Euler-Lagrange {{equations of motion}} {{as well as the}} bubble nucleation probabilities by integrating the Euclidean action. We illustrate three possible ways to obtain vacuum bubbles: true <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubbles</b> for ω>- 3 / 2, false <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubbles</b> for ω- 3 / 2 when the vacuum energy of the false vacuum in the potential of the Einstein frame is less than that of the true <b>vacuum.</b> After the <b>bubble</b> is nucleated at the t= 0 surface, we can smoothly interpolate the field combinations to some solutions in the Lorentzian signature and consistently continue their subsequent evolutions. Therefore, we conclude that, in general scalar-tensor theories like this Brans-Dicke type theories, which may include and represent certain features of string theory, <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubbles</b> come in false <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubbles</b> as well as in true <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubbles,</b> as long as a special condition is assumed on the potential.

40|$|In this presentation, {{we discuss}} the {{nucleation}} and subsequent evolution of false vacuum bubbles in the scalar-tensor gravity. First, we transform the scalar-tensor type theory of gravity to the standard Brans-Dicke type. Second, we transform the Brans-Dicke type theory from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame. For a certain potential, a true <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubble</b> in the Einstein frame can be transformed to a false <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubble</b> in the Jordan frame by a conformal transformation. Thus, in the Jordan frame, the nucleation of a false <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubble</b> can be possible and its subsequent evolution can be described {{with the help of}} thin-wall approximation.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{possible}} types of the nucleation of vacuum bubbles. We classify vacuum bubbles in de Sitter background and present some numerical solutions. The thin-wall approximation is employed {{to obtain the}} nucleation rate and the radius of vacuum bubbles. With careful analysis we confirm that Parke's formula is also applicable to the large true vacuum bubbles. The nucleation of the false <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubble</b> in de Sitter background is also evaluated. The tunneling process in the potential with degenerate vacua is analyzed as the limiting cases of the large true <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubble</b> and false <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubble.</b> Next, we consider the pair creation of black holes {{in the background of}} bubble solutions. We obtain static bubble wall solutions of junction equation with black hole pair.

40|$|According to a basic rule of fermionic and bosonic many-body physics, {{known as}} the linked cluster theorem, {{physical}} observables are not affected by <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubbles,</b> which represent virtual particles created from vacuum and self-annihilating without interacting with real particles. Here, we show that this conventional knowledge must be revised for anyons, quasiparticles that obey fractional exchange statistics intermediate between fermions and bosons. We find that a certain class of <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubbles</b> of Abelian anyons does affect physical observables. They represent virtually excited anyons which wind around real anyonic excitations. These topological bubbles result in a temperature-dependent phase shift of Fabry-Perot interference patterns in the fractional quantum Hall regime accessible in current experiments, thus providing a tool for direct and unambiguous observation of elusive fractional statistics.

40|$|Child universes (inflationary or non-inflationary) are {{regions of}} spacetime that {{disconnect}} {{from the original}} ambient spacetime. In the traditional models {{within the framework of}} GUT, a mass threshold of about 50 kg. is present for the child universe formation process.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{quantization}} of the Einstein-Hilbert action {{for a small}} true <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubble</b> without matter or scalar field. The quantization of action induces an extra term of potential called quantum potential in Hamilton-Jacobi equation, which gives expanding solutions including the exponential expansion solutions of the scalar factor $a$ for the bubble. We show that exponential expansion of the bubble continues with a short period (about a Planck time $t_p$), no matter whether the bubble is closed, flat or open. The exponential expansion ends spontaneously when the bubble becomes large, i. e., the scalar factor $a$ of the bubble approaches a Planck length $l_p$. We show that it is quantum potential of the small true <b>vacuum</b> <b>bubble</b> that {{plays the role of}} the scalar field potential suggested in the slow-roll inflation model.
