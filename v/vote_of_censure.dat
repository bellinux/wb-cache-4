5|$|The French counter-attacked and {{recapture}}d Guadeloupe on 2 June 1794. Jervis and Grey {{landed a}} force to recapture the island but were repulsed by the reinforced French garrison and the British expedition withdrew. In November 1794 Admiral Benjamin Caldwell replaced Jervis. Disputes over prize money were widely held as the reason that Jervis and Grey were not awarded peerages for their service. Grey and Jervis' enemies proposed a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> against the General and Admiral. The vote itself was negative. The prize money for the capture of the three islands, when finally calculated, amounted to £70,000 that {{was due to the}} officers and men of the navy. If adjusted for inflation this would equal approximately £ as of 20. Jervis and Grey were however awarded the thanks of both Houses of Parliament for their services. On 12 April 1794 Jervis was promoted vice-admiral of the white.|$|E
25|$|The ensuing Antonio di Rudini cabinet lent {{itself to}} Cavallotti’s campaign, {{and at the}} end of 1897 the {{judicial}} authorities applied to the Chamber of Deputies for permission to prosecute Crispi for embezzlement. A parliamentary commission of inquiry discovered only that Crispi, on assuming office in 1893, had found the secret service coffers empty, and had borrowed money from a state bank to fund it, repaying it with the monthly installments granted in regular course by the treasury. The commission, considering this proceeding irregular, proposed, and the Chamber adopted, a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure,</b> but refused to authorize a prosecution.|$|E
25|$|On 2June 1916, Lord Kitchener {{personally}} {{answered questions}} asked by politicians about his {{running of the}} war effort; {{at the start of}} hostilities Kitchener had ordered two million rifles from various US arms manufacturers. Only 480 of these rifles had arrived in the UK by 4 June 1916. The numbers of shells supplied were no less paltry. Kitchener explained the efforts he had made to secure alternative supplies. He received a resounding vote of thanks from the 200 Members of Parliament who had arrived to question him, both for his candour and for his efforts to keep the troops armed; Sir Ivor Herbert, who, a week before, had introduced the failed <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> in the House of Commons against Kitchener's running of the War Department, personally seconded the motion.|$|E

60|$|Distractions grew thicker {{upon the}} cabinet, and a just reader, now {{far away from}} the region <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure,</b> will bear them in mind. The Queen, like many of her subjects, grew impatient, but Mr. Gladstone was {{justified}} in reminding her of the imperfect knowledge, and he might have called it blank ignorance, with which the government was required on the shortest notice to form conclusions on a remote and more than half-barbarous region.|$|R
60|$|The {{state of}} the county of Clare was a godsend to the obstructive. Clare was not at that moment quite as {{innocent}} as the garden of Eden before the fall, but the condition was not serious; it had been twenty times worse before without occupying the House of Commons five minutes. Now an evening a week was not thought too much for a hollow debate on disorder in Clare. It {{was described as a}} definite matter of urgent importance, though it had slept for years, and though three times in succession the judge of assize (travelling entirely out of his proper business) had denounced the state of things. It was made to support five <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> in eight weeks.|$|R
500|$|Cotton, {{normally}} {{of a very}} placid disposition, was indignant {{over the}} proceedings and lead a delegation to admonish Wilson for his uncharitable insinuations. On Saturday, 31 December 1636, the Boston congregants met to prefer charges against Wilson. [...] Governor Vane launched the attack, and was joined by {{other members of the}} congregation. [...] Wilson met the onslaught with a quiet dignity, and responded soberly to each of the accusations brought against him. [...] The crowd refused to accept his excuses, and demanded a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure.</b> At this point Cotton intervened, and with more restraint than his parishioners, offered that without unanimity a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> was out of order. While the ultimate indignity of censure was averted, Cotton nevertheless gave a grave exhortation to his colleague to allay the temper of the congregants. The next day Wilson preached such a conciliatory sermon that even Governor Vane rose and voiced his approval.|$|E
500|$|Thirteen {{years after}} his death, the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica said of Bayard that [...] "his tall dignified person, unfailing courtesy, and polished, if {{somewhat}} deliberate, eloquence made him a man of mark in all the best circles. He was considered indeed by many Americans to have become too partial to English ways; and, {{for the expression of}} some criticisms regarded as unfavorable to his own countrymen, the House of Representatives {{went so far as to}} pass... a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> on him. [...] The value of Bayard's diplomacy was, however, fully recognized in the United Kingdom where he worthily upheld the traditions of a famous line of American ministers." [...] In 1929, the Dictionary of American Biography described Bayard, as a Senator, as being [...] "remembered rather for his opposition to Republican policies... than for constructive legislation of the successful solution of great problems", and said that he had [...] "the convictions of an earlier day... and was never inclined, either politically or socially, to seek popularity with the country at large." [...] Charles C. Tansill, a conservative historian, found much to praise in Bayard; he published a volume on Bayard's diplomatic career in 1940 and another about his congressional career in 1946, the only full-length biographies to appear since Bayard's death. [...] Later historians took a dimmer view of Bayard's diplomatic career; in a 1989 book, Henry E. Mattox numbered Bayard among the Gilded Age foreign service officers who were [...] "demonstrably incompetent." ...|$|E

25|$|Conservative leader Stephen Harper, {{the leader}} of the Opposition, {{introduced}} a motion of no confidence on November 24, which NDP leader Jack Layton seconded. The motion was voted upon and passed in the evening of November 28, with all present MPs from the NDP, Bloc Québécois, and Conservatives and 3 Independents (Bev Desjarlais, David Kilgour and Pat O'Brien), voting with a combined strength <b>of</b> 171 <b>votes</b> for the motion and 132 Liberals and one Independent (Carolyn Parrish) voting against. One Bloc Québécois MP was absent from the vote. It is the fifth time a Canadian government has lost the confidence of Parliament, but the first time this has happened on a straight motion of no confidence. The four previous instances have been due to loss <b>of</b> supply or <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure.</b>|$|R
60|$|On one <b>of</b> these <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> on Irish administration, {{moved by}} Mr. Balfour (March 27), Mr. Gladstone {{listened to the}} debate. At 8 we begged him not to stay and {{not to take the}} trouble to speak, so trumpery was the whole affair. He said he must, if only for five minutes, to show that he {{identified}} himself with his Irish minister. He left to dine, and then before ten was on his feet, making what Lord Randolph Churchill rightly called “a most impressive and entrancing speech.” He talked of Pat this and Michael that, and Father the other, as if he had pondered their cases for a month, clenching every point with extraordinary strength as well as consummate ease and grace, and winding up with some phrases of wonderful simplicity and concentration.|$|R
50|$|His {{reply to}} the <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> passed by the Assembly, and their refusal to {{increase}} his civil list was to hint at a vast communistic plot in order to scare the bourgeoisie, and to denounce the electoral law of 31 May 1850, {{in order to gain}} the support of the mass of the people. The Assembly retaliated by throwing out the proposal for a partial reform of that article of the constitution which prohibited the re-election of the president and the re-establishment of universal suffrage (July). All hope of a peaceful issue was at an end. When the questors called upon the Chamber to have posted up in all barracks the decree of 6 May 1848 concerning the right of the Assembly to demand the support of the troops if attacked, the Mountain, dreading a restoration <b>of</b> the monarchy, <b>voted</b> with the Bonapartists against the measure, thus disarming the legislative power.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> was {{defeated}} by 313 votes to 295, with Palmerston's old enemies in the pacifist camp, Cobden and Bright, voting for him. The result of the vote was announced at 2:30 in the morning, and when Palmerston heard the news he ran {{up the stairs to}} the Ladies' Gallery and embraced his wife. Disraeli wrote: [...] "What pluck to mount those dreadful stairs at three o'clock in the morning, and eighty years of age!" ...|$|E
2500|$|As Asquith brought MacDonald in so, {{later in}} the same year, he had {{significant}} responsibility for forcing him out over the Campbell Case and the Russian Treaty. The Conservatives proposed a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> against the Government for withdrawing their prosecution for sedition against the Daily Worker, and Asquith moved an amendment calling for a select committee (the same tactic he had employed over the Marconi Scandal and the Maurice Debate). Asquith's contribution to the debate showed an increasingly rare return to Parliamentary form. [...] "Almost {{every one of his}} delightful sentences filled the Chamber with laughter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wall has {{continued}} to be an out-spoken member of the Green Party, particularly {{on the issue of}} entering into alliances with other parties. He was given a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> by the Green Party Association of Green Councillors (AGC) when he made comments concerning the alliance between Green Party, Conservative and Liberal Democrat councillors on the Leeds City Council; he stated in Red Pepper magazine that, [...] "While I understand that repellent Labour councils may be the only substitute for alliances with Liberal Democrats and Conservatives, the fall in our Leeds West vote suggests that voters were displeased by a perceived shift to the right by Yorkshire Greens".|$|E
50|$|On {{his return}} to England, Ellenborough was created Earl of Ellenborough, in the county of Cumberland, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath and {{received}} the thanks of parliament; but his administration soon became the theme of hostile debates, though it was successfully vindicated by Peel and Wellington. When Peel's cabinet was reconstituted in 1846 Ellenhorough became First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1858 he took office under Lord Derby {{as president of the}} board of control, for the fourth time. It was then his congenial task to draft the new scheme for the government of India which the Indian Rebellion of 1857 had rendered necessary. But his old fault of impetuosity again proved his stumbling-block. He wrote a caustic despatch censuring Lord Canning for the Oudh proclamation, and allowed it to be published in The Times without consulting his colleagues, who disavowed his action in this respect. General disapprobation was excited; <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> were announced in both Houses; and, to save the cabinet, Ellenborough resigned.|$|R

50|$|The Government answers {{exclusively}} to Parliament, both through compulsory information of Parliament and through questions, interpellations and inquiry committees.

2500|$|Plummer was criticised in an {{editorial}} in The Times for [...] "failing to restore confidence (even among his staff) in the higher conduct of the scheme". His appointment was called into question by Alan Lennox-Boyd because Strachey had been an old colleague of his in the Independent Labour Party. The next month, Plummer was also criticised by the Conservatives for giving a contract for air transport to the nationalised British Overseas Airways Corporation rather than two private airlines which had submitted lower tenders, one of whom subsequently went out of business. A House of Lords debate on the groundnut scheme on 14 December 1949 resulted in a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> of the government, after the Marquess of Salisbury attacked Plummer for being an entirely inappropriate choice to run it.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 June Palmerston {{gave his}} {{statement}} to the Commons and said Britain would not {{go to war with}} the German powers unless the existence of Denmark as an independent power was at stake or that her capital was threatened. The Conservatives replied that Palmerston had betrayed the Danes and a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> in the House of Lords was carried by nine votes. In the debate in the Commons the Conservative MP General Peel said: [...] "It is come to this, that the words of the Prime Minister of England, uttered in the Parliament of England, are to be regarded as mere idle menaces to be laughed at and despised by foreign powers?" [...] Palmerston replied in the last night of the debate: [...] "I say that England stands as high as she ever did and those who say she had fallen in the estimation of the world are not the men to whom the honour and dignity of England should be confided".|$|E

The official release of the song and Rockin' Squat's album Confessions D'un Enfant Du Siècle Volume 2 was on May 12, 2009. The instrumental from the song was sampled from Wendy Rene's [...] "After Laughter". The song expresses the inequalities of the Third World and revolutionary events throughout history against tyranny and oppression.|$|E
50|$|The National Assembly {{may force}} the {{resignation}} of the government by <b>voting</b> a motion <b>of</b> <b>censure.</b> For this reason, the Prime Minister and their government are necessarily from the dominant party or coalition in the assembly. In the case of a president and assembly from opposing parties, this leads to the situation known as cohabitation. While motions <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> are periodically proposed by the opposition following government actions that it deems highly inappropriate, they are purely rhetorical; party discipline ensures that, throughout a parliamentary term, the government is never overthrown by the Assembly.|$|R
5000|$|The Prime Minister {{can engage}} the {{responsibility}} of his government on a law, under article 49-3 of the Constitution.

50|$|Motions of no confidence, {{also called}} <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> confidence, <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> no-confidence or <b>censure</b> motions, are {{a feature of}} the Westminster system of {{government}} used in the United Kingdom that requires an executive to retain the confidence of the House of Commons. It is a fundamental principle of the British constitution that the Government must retain the confidence of the legislature as it is not possible for a Government to operate effectively without the support {{of the majority of the}} legislature.|$|R
2500|$|These {{events and}} the {{disagreements}} that arose from them within the Whig Party, led to its break-up and to the rupture of Burke's friendship with Fox. In debate in Parliament on Britain's relations with Russia, Fox praised {{the principles of the}} revolution, although Burke was not able to reply at this time as he was [...] "overpowered by continued cries of question from his own side of the House". When Parliament was debating the Quebec Bill for a constitution for Canada, Fox praised the revolution and criticised some of Burke's arguments, such as hereditary power. On 6 May 1791, during another debate in Parliament on the Quebec Bill, Burke used the opportunity to answer Fox, and to condemn the new French Constitution and [...] "the horrible consequences flowing from the French idea of the Rights of Man". Burke asserted that those ideas were the antithesis of both the British and the American constitutions. Burke was interrupted, and Fox intervened, saying that Burke should be allowed to carry on with his speech. A <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> was moved against Burke, however, for noticing the affairs of France, which was moved by Lord Sheffield and seconded by Fox. Pitt made a speech praising Burke, and Fox made a speech—both rebuking and complimenting Burke. He questioned the sincerity of Burke, who seemed to have forgotten the lessons he had learned from him, quoting from Burke's own speeches of fourteen and fifteen years before.|$|E

50|$|A <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no {{confidence}} (<b>censure)</b> {{is a means}} for the National Assembly, on its own initiative, to force the government to resign.
