Methods: The passive time-integrated method of using a solid state nuclear track detector (LR- 115 type II) was employed.

40|$|International audienceUsing thin {{reinforcements}} is {{a common}} way to strengthen structures, as in reinforced concrete for example. From a numerical point of view, dealing with these reinforcements is tedious, because of their diameter which is usually small compared to the characteristic dimensions of the structures, therefore requiring very fine meshes to represent them accurately. In this paper, a new approach allowing to mix a <b>volumic</b> and a lineic modeling of the reinforcements is proposed. Fine meshes with a <b>volumic</b> representation of the reinforcements {{are used in the}} zones of interest of the structure, whereas coarser meshes associated to lineic elements are used {{in the rest of the}} structure in order to decrease the computing times. A methodology to ensure the transition between both modeling is proposed, so that the results in the zones of interest are similar to the results that would be obtained with a full <b>volumic</b> representation of the reinforcements. The efficiency of the method is illustrated on several examples, involving linear elasticity and plasticity...|$|E

40|$|International audienceApplications of {{reinforced}} composites and heterogeneous solids are widespread, spanning technological {{areas of}} various aerospace and mechanical industries. A real challenge concerning these materials is their life time prediction when subjected to {{wide variety of}} environmental and mechanical loading conditions that can initiate damage and lead to failure. Indeed, damage at the smallest scales drives damage accumulation at larger length scales until some critical local damage state is attained that causes macroscopic failure. A key issue in predicting life time is to characterise distributed <b>volumic</b> and localised damage and to understand the mechanisms of its initiation, evolution and criticality and so, the identification of relevant precursors of failure. To answer to these questions, <b>volumic</b> and guided ultrasonic waves and acoustic emission are of particular interest. As {{a matter of fact}} <b>volumic</b> ultrasonic wave propagation is sensitive to homogeneously distributed microcracks and represents in that case a good damage indicator. Guided waves as Lamb waves especially when generated from inside the material using an inserted piezoelectric element offer a specific sensitivity to localised damage as cracks or delaminations. Besides, acoustic emission which corresponds to the energy released by the material during the damage processes {{is directly related to the}} damage mechanisms and so can give pertinent information about the damage initiation and development. In this paper, our aim is to show in the one hand the ability of <b>volumic</b> ultrasonic waves to characterise <b>volumic</b> damage of glass epoxy composites under hydrothermal ageing and also the ability of Lamb waves to detect and identify localised damage. In the other hand our purpose is to demonstrate the potentiality of acoustic emission in understanding the damage mechanisms that occurs during a tensile test of polymer fibre composites and to discriminate in real time the different types of damage occurring at the microscopic scale...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aneurysms {{with a wide}} neck {{constitute}} a persistent challenge for endovascular therapy with coils. Our purpose was to evaluate the immediate anatomic and clini-cal results of treating intracranial wide-necked aneurysms by using three-dimensional (3 D) coils. METHODS: During a 2 -year period, 160 aneurysms (116 with a neck 4 mm, group B) in 157 patients in eight participating centers were consecutively treated. The procedure consisted first of framing the aneurysm {{with one or more}} 3 D spherical coils and then filling it with helical coils. Results were evaluated with univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis was used to identify independent predictors of these results. RESULTS: Angiographic occlusion was complete in 84 (72 %) and 30 (68 %) aneurysms in groups A and B, respectively. Mean percentage of <b>volumic</b> occlusion in these groups was 30. 9 % and 29. 2 %, respectively. Perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were 4 %, respectively, in group A and 2 %, respectively, in group B. No significant {{difference between the two groups}} was observed. However, percentage of <b>volumic</b> occlusion correlated with sac-to-neck ratio less than 1. 5 (P. 061) and with sac size (P. 002) except when three or more 3 D coils per aneurysm were used (P. 222). The better the percentage of <b>volumic</b> occlusion, the better the degree of angiographic occlusion (P. 004). Percentage of <b>volumic</b> occlusion was an independent predictor of angiographic complete occlusion (P. 001). World Federation of Neurological Surgeons subarachnoid hemorrhage scale grade 5 was an independent predictor of perioper-ative mortality (P. 043). CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional coils proved to be useful for improving coil packing and angiographic and <b>volumic</b> occlusion of aneurysms with a neck greater than 4 mm, at the time of treatment, provided the sac-to-neck ratio was 1. 5 or greater, and the largest number of 3 D coils were first positioned.
