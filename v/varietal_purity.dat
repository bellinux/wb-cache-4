The <b>varietals</b> <b>purity</b> is one of the factors whose inspection is more difficult and more complicated than that of other factors. In the present grain-handling system, grain type and quality are rapidly assessed by visual inspection. This evaluation process is, however, tedious and time consuming. The decision-making capabilities of a grain inspector can be seriously affected by his/her physical condition such as fatigue and eyesight, mental state caused by biases and work pressure, and working conditions such as improper lighting, climate, etc. The farmers are affected by this manual activity. Hence, these tasks require automation and develop imaging systems that can be helpful to identify quality of grain images. A model of quality grade testing and identification is built which is based on appearance features such as the morphological and colour with technology of computer image processing and neural network.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Entomology, Washington State UniversityCross-pollination by bees is {{necessary}} for commercial alfalfa seed production. To maintain <b>varietal</b> <b>purity</b> in alfalfa, seed producers adhere to spatial isolation standards to minimize or prevent bee flight and subsequent pollen flow between fields. The increased use of genetically-engineered (GE) crops in agriculture has raised concerns over pollinator-mediated gene flow between transgenic and conventional agricultural varieties. The 2011 deregulation of genetically engineered glyphosate-resistant alfalfa by the USDA has generated public concern and scientific debate over current recommended bee management practices {{and their ability to}} maintain <b>varietal</b> <b>purity</b> of alfalfa grown for seed production. The primary objective of this research is to determine the roles that pollinators play in contributing to undesired gene flow between alfalfa fields. We evaluated the impact of migratory beekeeping practices on transgenic pollen flow between spatially isolated alfalfa fields by permitting honey bees, Apis mellifera, to openly forage upon transgenic alfalfa blossoms, and transporting them 112 km to forage on caged conventional alfalfa following either 8 or 32 hours of isolation from the transgenic source. Cross-pollination between transgenic and conventional alfalfa was nearly eliminated (0. 00008 %) following eight hours of isolation from the transgenic source. The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (ALCB), is another commercially managed pollinator used extensively in alfalfa pollination. We evaluated the influence of the ALCB on gene flow between GE and conventional alfalfa seed fields by testing for the presence of the GE trait in pollen provisions collected from domiciles located in conventional alfalfa seed fields planted directly adjacent to GE alfalfa fields. Pollen samples collected from domiciles in conventional seed fields were at variable distances from the adjacent GE fields. Alfalfa seed in the vicinity of each domicile was harvested and tested for the transgene. We found that the ALCB frequently forages at distances which exceed current estimates for ALCB foraging range. Additionally, GE trait expression in harvested conventional seed was detected at rates that surpass established thresholds for <b>varietal</b> <b>purity.</b> Measurable impacts of ALCB-mediated pollen flow were confirmed and can be used to inform science policy regarding the development of best management practices mitigating undesired gene flow between genetically distinct alfalfa varieties.

40|$|Correct {{identification}} of cereal varieties {{is important to}} food quality, safety and authenticity and recently, molecular markers have been applied to cereal varietal identification. Two major factors restricting the wider application of molecular markers in crop plant genetics have been throughput and cost per data point. However, in recent years, novel molecular tools, the re-invention/re-application of mature technologies, and miniaturisation of technology has both increased throughput and significantly reduced these costs. Here we have applied Sequenom MassARRAY MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a collection of recently developed SNPs to facilitate cereal varietal identification. We used a multiplexed Sequenom MassARRAY mass spectrometry SNP assay targeting 45 loci to genotype a collection of Australian barley varieties. Of the 45 loci screened, 33 were informative and were used to generate a unique barcode of SNPs for each variety tested.

This is partly because the formal seed systems are not always effective in meeting demand for new seed varieties. Sometimes informal seed recycling and exchange of improved sorghum varieties will take place alongside formal initiatives, {{as is the case}} in southern Mali. Focusing on one particular village in the Dioïla district, we analyze the efficacy of farmers' strategies for preserving <b>varietal</b> seed <b>purity</b> and genetic integrity of an improved inbred-line (Soumba variety). Six seed lots of Soumba, recycled for two to six years by farmers using different practices, were collected and assessed in on-station trials in order to compare their agronomic performance and phenotypic purity (off-type plant frequencies) with control versions of the variety. Additionally, 30 panicle samples were randomly collected from five farmer fields sown with recycled Soumba and assessed for phenotypic purity in a progeny nursery and investigated for molecular diversity using 12 SSR markers. A total of 150 panicles from five other non-Soumba varieties were collected in the village in order to investigate eventual gene flow and its potential genetic consequences for the Soumba variety. In fields sown with recycled Soumba seed, between 2 % and 14 % of plants showed phenotypic deviations from the typical Soumba variety. The progeny nursery and SSR marker analysis verified the presence of the off-type plants observed in the field. The STRUCTURE program revealed admixtures with other varieties in 23 % of Soumba plants, confirming the presence of gene flow. Gene diversity values in Soumba samples ranged from 0. 006 for the commercial sample to 0. 257 for recycled samples. Introgression and contamination were best minimized when (1) farmers had received specific training in seed production, (2) they could take advantage of isolated fields and (3) they could practise true-to-type panicle selection. Farmerswere generally able to maintain the phenotype, as well as sustain or even improve yield performance of their Soumba variety while at the same time genetically enriching their seed stock.

40|$|Co-existence {{is defined}} as the farmers being able to choose between conventional, organic and genetically {{modified}} (GM) crop production, in compliance with the relevant legislation on labelling rules and purity standards. Genes of cultivated plants spread in time and space through pollen and seed dispersal, and in addition handling during transport and processing may also disperse seeds. Consequently, suitable measures during cultivation, harvest, transport, storage, and processing are necessary to ensure co-existence in the supply chain of propagated seed. With the increasing area of GM-crop production {{as well as in the}} number of crops in which GM-varieties are available the need for guidelines to ensure coexistence are becoming increasingly essential. In organic farming systems only organically produced seed should be used. Within the European Union (EU) the regulation 2092 / 91 states that only organically produced seed can be used in organic farming systems. However, in a number of species organic seed is not available, and for the moment derogations are made that conventionally produced seed may be used in such circumstances. Seed of cultivated crops are often multiplied in specific regions – due to climatic conditions, growers expertise, the infrastructure of the seed industry etc. and hence seed is often moved cross borders, and therefore an internationally approved regulatory system, which guarantee the level of <b>varietal</b> identity and <b>purity,</b> is needed. ...|$|R

Replicated trials were conducted in Kenya using a local landrace, ‘Ochuti’ as pollen donor surrounded by male-sterile pollen baits.

Anther dehiscence correlated with increase in vapour pressure deficit in the morning. A negative exponential regression model with logarithmic transformation of PMGF and square-root transformation of distance from source field best fitted the data. Up to 50 % of female florets on a male sterile (MS) plant were pollinated at 1 m from pollen source and declined to 14 % at 10 m. The maximum distance of PMGF using the PMGF model, based on a threshold of one seed per MS plant, was 203 m when data above the 95 th percentile is considered.

40|$|The causal {{relationship}} between spoiled sweet clover and a hemor­rhagic condition in cattle was demonstrated by Schofield (31) in 1922. Since {{that time it}} has been found that the direct agent is dicoumarol, an anticoagulant causing hypoprothrombinemia and which is formed from coumarin during the spoilage process. All common varieties of sweet clover contain substantial amounts of coumarin, but recently a new coumarin variety "Cumino" has been developed in Canada. The low coumarin character, however, is deter­mined by a single recessive gene, consequently the variety may become rapidly contaminated because of cross-pollination with nearby stands or volunteer roadside sweet clover plants. Since contamination seems inevitable, the problem arises of establishing the relationship between the degree of contamination of low coumarin varieties and the potential risk involved in their use as feeds.

Stent. and Brachiaria spp. The images were analyzed by the fractal descriptors method, where a set of measures are obtained from the values of the fractal dimension at different scales. Therefore such values are used as inputs for a state-of-the-art classifier, the Support Vector Machine, which finally discriminates the images according to the respective species. The proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art image analysis methods and makes possible the correct prediction of species in more than 93 % of the samples. Such remarkable result is consequence of the better suitability of representing complex structures like those arising in the plant leaves by measures of complexity from fractal geometry.

The seed potato inspection schema of Finland includes several steps: the field inspection, the laboratory tests of potato cyst nematodes, bacterial ring rot, brown rot and potato virus and finally the visual tuber inspection. The field inspection, sampling and visual tuber inspection are done by the authorized inspectors. For prebasic and basic seed the inspectors make two official field inspections. For certified seed only one field inspection is needed. Official requirements are set for <b>varietal</b> <b>purity,</b> rogues, potato virus, black leg (Erwinia spp.) and Rhizoctonia. During the field inspection the background information as previous crop is checked. The soil sample for testing potato cyst nematodes is taken per each hectare. The potato cyst nematodes (Globodera sp.) are quarantine organisms and the seed potato production is not possible on the field infected by the nematodes. In the autumn the tubers for winter tests in the laboratory are sampled. For bacterial ring rot a sample is 200 tubers/ha and for virus tests 200 tubers/field. Brown rot is tested as a survey of seed potato production. The testing method for bacterial ring rot (Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus) and brown rot (Ralstonia solanacearum) is the immunofluorescense (IF) method based on the specific antibodies. These quarantine organisms are not accepted in the seed potato production. The potato virus Y-, A-, X-, S-, M- and Potato Leaf Roll are tested once during seed potato certification process usually as the prebasic seed. For the other seed classes the potato virus Y and potato virus A are tested. For certified seed potato class A there is a list of varieties which are tested. The seed class B is not routinely tested. The testing method is ELISAtest. The seed potato companies need certificate labels before sorting and packing potatoes. A visual tuber inspection is done by the local inspectors. A sample of 400 tubers/ 50 tn is cut by knife and tubers are inspected one by one. There are requirements for soil, dry and wet rot, external blemishes, common scab, black scurf, skin spot and deep-pitted scab. The quarantine organisms or visual symtops of moptop virus or tobacco rattle virus are not accepted. If all steps of inspection and testing are according to legislation, the seed potato lot is officially certified and can be marketed as seed potato to the farmers. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of the last 30 years cotton-growing has {{expanded}} steadily in the savanna lands of francophone Africa. On the other hand, during the same period, production in the English-speaking countries has declined sharply. Now, however, all the cotton producers are threatened by plummeting world markets, low producer prices, increasingly expensive inputs and demanding quality requirements. In 1960 90 % of the cotton produced in sub-Saharan Africa came from the anglophone countries; this figure has now dropped to 55 %. Production in francophone Africa, on the other hand, has shown an increase and these countries now harvest nearly half the continent's cotton crop. Production in Sudan, Uganda, Mozambique, Tanzania and Nigeria, which for years were the top producers (apart from Egypt), dropped considerably in the 1970 s. Of all the English-speaking countries, only Zimbabwe has managed to increase its production. The rise in cotton production in francophone West Africa has been spectacular. The area under cultivation has doubled in the past three decades, and stands at a million hectares. Cotton now accounts for ten times the area it did in 1981. Central Africa, however, has seen a small decline. Seed cotton yields have also rocketed, thanks to the distribution of higher performance varieties, with production rising from 400 kg/ha in 1970 to more than 1000 kg/ha today. The ginning percentage (the percentage of fibres removed from the seed cotton) is also on the increase and Africa holds the world record with more than 40 %. All this has meant that since 1960 cotton production has increased 36 -fold in francophone West Africa, 13 -fold in Madagascar, and by a factor of 2. 8 in Central Africa. Anglophone Africa's sharp decline So what has caused such a disparity between neighbouring countries with very similar production potentials? The year 1976 saw the abolition of the UK-based Cotton Research Corporation (formerly the ECGC) after 55 years of continuous service to African and Caribbean countries. Although the Corporation was widely regarded as being one of the most cost-effective of Britain's development assistance agencies, the UK Government and other donors were unable to offer a financial package that would enable the Corporation to continue. This was partly a result of the emphasis being given to food crop development at the time, and partly a consequence of the overall lack of financial resources following the 1974 oil crisis. In many of the anglophone countries in which Corporation staff had worked, productivity subsequently faltered and the quality of the fibre failed to meet changing market needs. Production was not properly structured and seed was not distributed regularly for sowing; as a result it gradually lost its <b>varietal</b> <b>purity.</b> Also, infrastructures were not maintained and so vehicles, depots and ginneries were allowed to fall into disrepair. Marketing difficulties added to the decline. Farmers had to wait too long to be paid for their crop, credit was scarce, and many small-scale farmers were no longer in a position to buy necessities such as fertilizers and pesticides. Cotton, traditionally grown on an extensive basis, was no longer economically viable. Food crops became more attractive and cotton had less and less to offer the peasant farmer. More research effort has been put into food crops and new varieties have led to high production increases, for example, that of maize in Nigeria and rice in Tanzania. Food crops nowadays provide a more lucrative and reliable source of income, especially since the purchase price of cotton has fallen and the cost of fertilizers and pesticides has risen. For example, in 196670 Nigeria produced 50, 000 tonnes of cotton fibre, but only 10, 000 in 1985. Similarly, in Uganda the harvest has been reduced from 76, 000 t to 6, 000 t, in Mozambique it has dropped from 43, 000 to 11, 000 t, and in the Sudan from 205, 000 to 142, 000 t. It should not be forgotten, however, that these countries have gone through long periods of political and social upheaval and cotton was not the only crop to suffer. In most anglophone countries indifference on the part of the government has gone hand-in-hand with a reduction in the area under cotton cultivation. Producers are no longer interested in a crop which is not backed by research, training, organized marketing, and which is also costly in terms of labour and chemicals. Lately, however, the authorities in these countries seem to have woken up to the problem, and are initiating rescue programmes. A finely-tuned operation in French-speaking Africa The picture is very different in french-speaking Africa, where cotton is assuming an ever more important place in the economy. In countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad, cotton now accounts for 40 - 60 % of the export trade and 5 - 7 % of the gross domestic product. In Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon and Senegal, cotton is of secondary importance nationally but is the principal source of income for entire regions within these countries. In the savanna zones cotton is now the only crop which brings in regular cash-income. Its success is the result of highly efficient organization in the producing countries. The cotton companies were originally set up by the Compagnie Francaise pour le Développement des Textiles (CDFT), but were Africanized in the 1970 s. Generally speaking all cotton producing activities (production, processing, marketing), come under the aegis of these companies. This vertical integration of the activities ensures better operation and coordination. The farmers are well-informed and trained. They can buy their seed, fertilizers and pesticides on credit, and supply is constant. Technical advice and support are available to them throughout the season. Above all, they can be sure of a pre-set and guaranteed price for their crop, paid on delivery. The French institute for research on cotton and exotic textiles (IRCT) also offers support in the shape of improved seed varieties, improved spraying schedules and assessment of fertilizer requirements. This kind of help is largely responsible for the enormous increase in production levels of the past 30 years. The whole cotton network, which is highly organized, efficient and stable, with considerable human and material resources, instills confidence in the small-scale cotton producers. From being the 'Bwana's' compulsory crop, cotton has now become a crop of the people and attachment to it explains the amazing expansion of cotton in the savanna zones, where it has become the mainspring of development. Cotton the engine of development This increasing intensification of cotton growing has given farmers access to modern agricultural techniques, use of improved seed, crop protection products and mineral fertilizers, all of which are in general use today. In 1987 - 88, 77 % of the cotton producing land had fertilizer applications of 145 kg/ha, and 79 % received three applications of fertilizer. The income generated by cotton gives farmers the means of acquiring livestock and the necessary equipment for animal traction. This introduction to mechanization, which means that ploughing can be five times as fast, is most advanced in the cotton zones (53 % of all agricultural land in 198788). In Mali draft power is used on 90 % of all cotton-growing holdings. The cotton companies contributed significantly to the development of draft power by setting up animal training units, by popularizing the practice and by ensuring the availability of the necessary equipment. They also boosted progress towards intermediate mechanization by promoting small tractors and by undertaking their assembly, delivery, technical follow-up and after-sales service. However, the use of these tractors remains limited even though they were specifically designed for use in cotton growing. These companies have now extended their interests beyond the development of cotton growing alone. In most of the countries under discussion they have taken over the technical aspects and even the marketing and promoting of food crops. In Cameroon in 1987 SODECOTON supported the intensification of 38, 000 ha of maize, the same area of groundnuts and 35, 000 ha of sorghum. In Mali, a maize programme by the Compagnie Malienne pour le Développement des Textiles (CMDT), which was launched ten years ago in the south of the country, has become a model for the whole of West Africa. New, more productive varieties and more intensive growing methods have been introduced and these have given yields a considerable boost, reaching three tonnes/ha in the cotton zone. Because these yields exceeded needs for family consumption, outlets were needed, and CMDT assisted in the installation of mills which produce processed foodstuffs (flour, 'maize flour' and semolina) which are easier to market. A cotton buying-post Cotton-growing benefits the development of food crops in another way: crops thrive on the residue of the fertilizers used on the cotton and as a result the most productive farms are in the cotton-growing regions. Furthermore, cotton companies frequently undertake such improvement programmes as the construction of roads, tracks, schools and dispensaries. The cotton business has also given rise to professional associations for farmers, and these can be influential: recently some of these groups in Mali took part in CMDT board meetings. Another result of the presence of the cotton companies is improved infrastructure, the building of depots for seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, and ginneries. In ten francophone African states in West Africa all cottonseed is ginned at the place of production and most is pressed for oil. The cottonseed-cake is usually used for cattle feed. On the other hand, only 10 % of the fibre is processed in local factories, with most going for export. The African fibre, which is harvested by hand, is much sought after for its quality, which gives it an advantage on the international market. Fall in world price Until 1985 cotton prices on the world market remained high and everyone benefited: the peasant farmers who were getting generous subsidies on chemicals made a comfortable income; the cotton companies made good profits; and the governments got substantial tax revenue. But in {{the course of}} a few years this has changed. In May 1984 a kilo of fibre sold at US$ 3. 18, while 15 months later the price had dropped to US$ 0. 94. The bottom [elf out of the market because a bumper harvest coincided with the arrival of highly competitive Chinese cotton. In one year alone the cotton companies announced losses of 100 billion FCFA which was too much to be absorbed by national budgets. Despite a slight improvement in the past year or so, the market is once again heading downward. This time a record crop in the USA and the sale of cotton from the former Soviet Union are responsible. For the African producers this situation has emphasized the downside of the present system. The current selling price of cotton means that the companies are no longer in a position to help the farmers financially. After 1986 reorganization was instituted in order to cut costs and some reductions have resulted from stringent economies. It has been accepted that the costs of farmer training and rural development can no longer be borne by cotton production alone. Subsidies for chemicals have been abolished and the peasant farmers have had to pay the market price. The village associations have gradually taken over marketing and the price paid to the producer has fallen sharply. Most countries have now fixed a minimum of approximately 80 - 100 FCFA for each season, although if the market price goes up the farmers get more. As a result, some farmers are now questioning the viability of cotton, and in some places less land is being used for the crop. Facing the challenge Reorganizing cotton production does not guarantee that it will be viable. Competition is increasingly fierce and to withstand it productivity will have to rise again, quality improve further and all cotton products will have to be profitable. Yields can be increased by much heavier applications of fertilizer, especially in densely-populated areas where there is no possibility of land lying fallow. But farmers cannot afford more fertilizer when their income has fallen and research is under way to find a less expensive solution, perhaps a closer link between agricultural and pastoral systems. Other cost-cutting exercises which are being investigated include adjusting the timing of sprayings to suit individual situations, using different types of insecticides and reducing the quantity of pesticides used. Quality control is becoming more and more stringent and the producing countries must take account of this if they wish to meet market needs and sell their cotton at a good price. The new spinning method, (called 'open end') where the lap or sliver is processed into yarn by feeding it through a disc which spins at 70, 000 rpm, can be used only for short, fine, tough fibres which are completely clean. New measuring techniques monitor fibre quality extremely rapidly. Another approach to increasing the competitiveness of cotton is the development of 'landless cotton, the by-products of which have more uses than those of conventional varieties (see Box). Countries or regions whose economies rely on cotton will have to put much more effort into improved production and diversification if they are to survive in a changing market.
