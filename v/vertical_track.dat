50|$|Anton Schwarzkopf and Intamin AG co-developed {{the first}} shuttle loop design, which opened as King Kobra at Kings Dominion in 1977.

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of the asymmetry between horizontal and <b>vertical</b> eye <b>tracking</b> was investigated longitudinally at 5, 7, and 9 months of age. The target moved either on a 2 D circular trajectory or on a vertical or horizontal 1 D sinusoidal trajectory. Saccades, smooth pursuit, and head movements were measured. <b>Vertical</b> <b>tracking</b> {{was found to be}} inferior to horizontal tracking at all age levels. The results also show that the mechanisms responsible for horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>tracking</b> mutually influence one another in the production of 2 D visual pursuit. Learning effects were observed within-trials but no transfer between trials was found...|$|R

40|$|A key hurdle {{to achieve}} video-rate atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) in constant-force contact mode is the inadequate bandwidth of the vertical feedback control loop. This paper describes techniques used to increase the <b>vertical</b> <b>tracking</b> bandwidth of a nanopositioner to a level that is sufficient for video-rate AFM. These techniques involve the combination of: a high-speed XYZ nanopositioner; a passive damping technique that cancels the inertial forces of the Z actuator which in turns eliminates the low 20 -kHz vertical resonant mode of the nanopositioner; an active control technique {{that is used to}} augment damping to high vertical resonant modes at 60 kHz and above. The implementation of these techniques allows a tenfold increase in the <b>vertical</b> <b>tracking</b> bandwidth, from 2. 3 (without damping) to 28. 1 kHz. This allows high-quality, video-rate AFM images to be captured at 10 frames/s without noticeable artifacts associated with vibrations and insufficient <b>vertical</b> <b>tracking</b> bandwidth...|$|R

50|$|Zuma's Revenge! {{introduces}} {{three types}} of levels that are new to the series. Some levels feature two lily pads that the frog can jump between, while other levels set the frog on a horizontal or <b>vertical</b> <b>track</b> and enable it to slide side-to-side or up and down rather than rotating to aim. There are also boss levels where the player has to shoot balls towards the enemies to reduce their hit points while simultaneously prevent the ball strings from reaching the emblem. The enemies in turn shoot projectiles that will induce a certain gimmick if they hit the player. These levels have an unlimited lives, so {{if one of the}} balls reaches the skull, they will try again. Players have no problem in getting a game over in this type of levels.|$|E
50|$|Up-N-Away was {{the name}} of a down-sliding bath/shower door {{manufactured}} by Unitspan Architectural Systems, Inc. The bathtub shower doors had vertical tracks instead of horizontal, and closed downward rather than sideways. There were no channel tracks {{on the side of the}} bathtub; this enabled the entire side to be free when the doors were open. This design was also to make the side of the tub always clean as well as comfortable to sit on when bathing a child. The down-sliding doors were counterbalanced to be kept up and out of the way for an elegant look, but slid to lower positions for showering. Within the <b>vertical</b> <b>track</b> channels, the lower left and right edge of each sliding door attached to counterweighted ropes with nylon hanger brackets. The downward-closing bath shower doors aimed to solve the disadvantages of conventional, sideways-sliding doors to provide more convenience, relaxation and luxury. They were at first marketed on a store- or factory-to-consumer basis, with do-it-yourself installation required.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the combination of}} active and passive damping control techniques to increase the <b>vertical</b> <b>tracking</b> bandwidth of a fast nanopositioner for video-speed atomic force microscopy (AFM). The passive damping technique utilizes an inertial counterbalance arrangement to mechanically cancel the low 20 -kHz vertical resonant mode of the nanopositioner; and the active control technique employs an integral resonant control technique to augment damping to resonant modes at 60 kHz and above. The combined damping techniques increases the <b>vertical</b> <b>tracking</b> bandwidth from 2. 3 kHz to 28. 1 kHz. This allow high-quality AFM images to be recorded at video speed, i. e. up to 1000 Hz line rate without noticeable image artifacts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Railway track {{stiffness}} is a {{basic parameter}} of track design which influences the bearing capacity, the dynamic behavior of passing vehicles, track geometry quality {{and the life of}} track components. In this paper track stiffness is treated {{from the point of view}} of the <b>vertical</b> <b>track</b> geometry deterioration modeling. In most of the models, the vertical geometry deterioration is considered to be a function of the number of loading cycles and/or a function of the magnitude of the loading. Deterioration should also be a function of the properties of the track superstructure and substructure, so, the track stiffness should be an indispensable part of those models. The aim of this study is to analyze the <b>vertical</b> <b>track</b> stiffness and its influence on geometry deterioration, and to make a comparative analysis between deterioration models that directly or indirectly include the effect of the <b>vertical</b> <b>track</b> stiffness...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{analyzes}} {{an attempt}} at integration of a pre-school class, a leisure-time center and an elementary school in Sweden. The integration was organized {{in the form of}} <b>Vertical</b> <b>Track</b> which implies a successive development of groups comprising children between six and twelve years old, pre-school teachers, recreation pedagogues, and schoolteachers. The integration was prompted by state governed reforms such as the 1992 law allowing six-year olds to start compulsory school. The study is based on cultural-historical activity theory and was carried out as participant observation and action research. The study addresses the question of the potentials and alternative goals for change and development of the present school pedagogy and classroom practice that integration implies. Special {{attention has been paid to}} what tools might potentially mediate in processes of integration. A research and educational program, the 5 thD, was jointly created between researchers and teachers and located in a <b>Vertical</b> <b>Track.</b> The capacity of this complex tool as a mediator in the multicultural <b>Vertical</b> <b>Track</b> structure was explored. It is argued that the <b>Vertical</b> <b>Track</b> as an instantiation of the integration reform represents an arena for potential expansive transformation. However, in order for integration to have an impact on the pedagogical practice in schools, teacher interactions need to be mediated by communicative and conceptual tools. It is suggested that the 5 thD program is an example of such tools.

The improved central difference method by ABAQUS explicit nonlinear dynamics module is chosen to calculate the vertical vibration of wheel axle.

40|$|Increased {{railroad}} traffic volumes, speeds, and {{axle loads}} {{have created a}} need to better measure track quality. Previous {{research has indicated that}} the <b>vertical</b> <b>track</b> deflection provides a meaningful indicator of track integrity. The measured deflection can be related to the bending stresses in the rail as well as characterize the mechanical response of the track. This investigation summarizes the simulation, analysis and development of a measurement system at the University of Nebraska (UNL) to measure <b>vertical</b> <b>track</b> deflection in real-time from a car moving at revenue speeds. The UNL system operates continuously over long distances and in revenue service. Using a camera and two line lasers, the system establishes three points of the rail shape beneath the loaded wheels and over a distance of 10 ft. The resulting rail shape can then be related to the actual bending stress in the rail and estimate the track support through beam theory. Finite element simulations are used to characterize the track response as related to the UNL measurement system. The results of field tests using bondable resistance strain gages illustrate the system’s capability of approximating the actual rail bending stresses under load...|$|E
