2500|$|The {{rebellion}} and its suppression effectively {{marked the end}} of the mamluk household al-Jazzar had raised, {{and the end of the}} mamluks as a military institution during al-Jazzar's rule. According to Philipp, the mamluk rebellion was al-Jazzar's [...] "gravest military and political crisis", with the only exception perhaps being Napoleon's siege of Acre in 1799, although the rebellion [...] "was in many ways more serious since it arose from an internal source." [...] The revolt was perceived by al-Jazzar, himself a <b>virtual</b> <b>product</b> of the mamluk system, as a betrayal of his most senior lieutenants, whose careers and wealth he created through his patronage. The rebellion thus had traumatic effects on al-Jazzar's personality, which according to Philipp, transformed al-Jazzar's [...] "latent fears, suspicions and distrust ... into a sense of paranoia". In the rebellion's aftermath, al-Jazzar launched a massive purge in his realm, executing and exiling people of all societal ranks. The 19th-century chronicler Haydar Ahmad Shihab noted that as a result of the rebellion, al-Jazzar [...] "became like an untamed animal ... he imagined that the whole world was against him." ...|$|E

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{awareness}} {{on the research}} of virtual worlds, it is claimed the development of virtual world is not merely the gaming purpose but which is rife with moneymaking opportunities. To further interpret the feasibilities of the models, scholar and practitioners have investigated and analyzed the literature of business model from various perspectives and theories. In this dissertation, Second Life (SL) is selected as the most appropriate platform for demonstrating the proper adoption of business model and application in virtual worlds. Based on the research on virtual worlds and relevant literature, the business models and applications in SL can be classified as Virtualization of Real Products; New <b>Virtual</b> <b>Products</b> or Services and Physicalization of <b>Virtual</b> <b>Products</b> or Services. In the light of research on virtual worlds, the major characteristics of VW embrace Interactivity, Immersion and Network Effects. After investigating the Media Richness Theory and Task Closure Theory, some elements generalized from these theories form some theoretical-based indicators to evaluate the 99 selected companies in Second Life. These theories suggest several significant factors which include Feedback Capability, Intuitive Cues, Avoid Overburdened Non-intuitive Cues, Personal Focus, Task Closure, Virtual Availability and Social Presence...|$|R
40|$|Intangibility {{has been}} a well-recognized {{research}} topic especially in service marketing. However, recently, as <b>virtual</b> <b>products</b> or information products have emerged in consumer markets, the role of intangibility has shifted from a service-exclusive term to a product-related one. This is because that many products are intangible in some degrees to consumers. Lately, academic research shows that intangibility, is a three-dimensional construct that includes: physical intangibility, mental intangibility, and generality. This finding has advanced the understandings on intangibility of <b>virtual</b> <b>products.</b> However, little {{has been done in}} relating to branding strategy and its influence on consumer behavior under this topic. Thus, the focus of this research is to study whether the branding strategy, as compared to the generic category strategy, is an efficient risk and evaluation difficulty reducer when the branded product/service is perceived to be intangible. Moreover, this research also concentrates on how the branding strategy will assist the consumer decision process by reducing perceived risk, evaluation difficulty and perceived intangibility. Data were collected among university students. The result of the data analysis shows that brand is a major intangibility-reducer especially for services. It also reduces consumer perceived evaluation difficulty and purchase-related risk...|$|R
