25|$|This {{was just}} 50 {{years before the}} arrival of the Spanish in the region. Consequently, Spanish chroniclers {{recorded}} accounts of Chimu culture from persons who had lived before the Inca conquest. Similarly, archaeological evidence suggest Chimor emerged from the remnants of Moche culture; early Chimu pottery had some resemblance to that of the Moche. Their ceramics are all-black, and their work in precious metals is very detailed and intricate. In the Late Chimu period, about 12,000 artisans lived and worked in Chan Chan alone. They engaged in fishing, agriculture, craft work, and trade. Artisans were forbidden to change their profession, and were grouped together in the citadel according to their area of specialization. Archeologists have noted a dramatic rise in the volume of Chimu craft production, which they attribute to artisans having been brought to Chan Chan from another area taken in conquest. As there is evidence of both metalwork (generally a male specialty) and weaving (a female art) in the same domestic dwelling, it is likely that both men and women were artisans. The men engaged in fishing, heavy agriculture (aided by irrigation and earthworks), and metallurgy. The women made ceramics and textiles (from spun and dyed cotton, llama, alpaca, and <b>vicuña</b> <b>wool).</b> People used reed fishing canoes, hunted, and traded using bronze coins.|$|E
50|$|As of June 2007, {{prices for}} vicuña fabrics {{can range from}} US$1,800 to US$3,000 per yard. <b>Vicuña</b> <b>wool</b> {{can be used for}} apparel (such as socks, sweaters, accessories, shawls, coats, and suits) and home {{furnishings}} (such as blankets and throws). A <b>vicuña</b> <b>wool</b> scarf costs around US$1,500. A vicuña sport coat from the Italian tailoring house Kiton costs at least $21,000.|$|E
50|$|Other animal {{textiles}} {{which are}} made from hair or fur are alpaca wool, <b>vicuña</b> <b>wool,</b> llama wool, and camel hair, generally used {{in the production of}} coats, jackets, ponchos, blankets, and other warm coverings. Angora refers to the long, thick, soft hair of the angora rabbit. Qiviut is the fine inner wool of the muskox.|$|E
5000|$|The vicuña (Vicugna vicugna) or vicugna (both [...] ) {{is one of}} two wild South American {{camelids}} which live in {{the high}} alpine areas of the Andes, the other being the guanaco. It is a relative of the llama, and is now believed to be the wild ancestor of domesticated alpacas, which are raised for their coats. Vicuñas produce small amounts of extremely fine wool, which is very expensive because the animal can only be shorn every three years, and has to be caught from the wild. When knitted together, the product of the <b>vicuña's</b> <b>wool</b> is very soft and warm. The Inca valued vicuñas highly for their wool, and it was against the law for anyone but royalty to wear vicuña garments; today the vicuña is the national animal of Peru and appears in the Peruvian coat of arms.|$|R
5000|$|Altmann also {{produced}} clothes in Shetland <b>wool,</b> <b>vicuna</b> and a lambswool/fur fibre blend called [...] "Bernamere". A 1960s advertising tagline {{for the company}} ran: [...] "The Legend of a Great Knitter." ...|$|R
25|$|The puna zone is {{composed}} of high, cold grasslands, suitable largely for pasture by camelids, the domesticated llama and alpaca, {{as well as the}} wild vicuña and guanaco. The former were used as not only as pack animals, but also for their meat and <b>wool.</b> <b>Vicuñas</b> and guanacos, though undomesticated, were used for their fine and much-prized wool. Little agriculture is performed in the puna, though in the Bolivian altiplano intensive agriculture was possible through the use of waru waru raised bed agriculture, which used specialized irrigation techniques to prevent frost from destroying crops.|$|R
50|$|Agnona {{produces}} {{about five}} thousand {{different kinds of}} wool. Wool fabrics produced by Agnona include cashmere, mohair, camel, alpaca, and vicuna. As of 1997, clients that used Agnona fabric in their clothing included Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, Gianni Versace, Jil Sander, Escada, Hugo Boss, Dior, Hermès, Valentino, Gianfranco Ferre, Joyce, Sanyo, and Marc Jacobs. The company {{is a part of}} the International Vicuna Consortium, which has the exclusive rights to the sale and marketing of <b>vicuna</b> <b>wool.</b>|$|E
50|$|The vicuña only {{produces}} about 0.5 kg of wool a year, {{and gathering}} {{it requires a}} certain process. During {{the time of the}} Incas, <b>vicuña</b> <b>wool</b> was gathered by means of communal efforts called chacu, in which multitudes of people herded hundreds of thousands of vicuña into previously laid funnel traps. The animals were shorn and then released; this was only done once every four years. The vicuña was believed to be the reincarnation of a beautiful young maiden who received a coat of pure gold once she consented to the advances of an old, ugly king. Because of this, it was against the law for anyone to kill a vicuña or wear its fleece, except for Inca royalty.|$|E
50|$|At present, the Peruvian {{government}} has a labeling system that identifies all garments that have been created through a government-sanctioned chacu. This guarantees that the animal was captured, shorn alive, returned to the wild, and cannot be shorn again for another two years. The program also ensures that {{a large portion of}} the profits return to the villagers. However, annually, up to 22,500 kg of <b>vicuña</b> <b>wool</b> are exported as a result of illegal activities. Because of this, some countries have banned the importation of the wool to save the animal. There is a limited but growing trend to commercially produce wool from vicuñas in captivity, with growing herds in the Chilean Andes. Biologist Cristian Bonacic has expressed his concern about the possibility of habitat damage and the transmission of disease in the farms.|$|E
5000|$|Vicuña creates [...] "precarious works;" [...] {{characteristic}} of Vicuña's work is {{her use of}} materials that are often fragile, worn by the elements and/or biodegradable: the return to the environment. She describes {{her work as a}} way of [...] "hearing an ancient silence waiting to be heard." [...] In 1966 she began creating sculptural interventions called precarios, combining ritual and assemblage and typically throw-away materials such as yarn, sticks, feathers, leaves, stones and bones. Linked to the sacred wild Andean vicuña animal by name, Cecilia <b>Vicuña</b> utilized the <b>wool</b> of these animals for her Cloud-Net installation series as a metaphoric tool. The visual language of this series resulted in large-scale warp and weft installations within rural and urban environments—weavings—thus linking Vicuña to the Feminist Art Movement's Pattern and Decoration Movement.|$|R
40|$|Softness of apparel {{textiles}} {{is a major}} attribute {{sought by}} consumers. There is surprisingly little objective information on the softness properties of rare animal fibres, particularly cashmere, alpaca and mohair. Samples {{of these and other}} rare animal fibres from different origins of production and processors were objectively measured for fibre diameter, fibre curvature (FC, crimp) and resistance to compression (softness). While there were curvilinear responses of resistance to compression to FC and to mean fibre diameter, FC accounted for much more of the variance in resistance to compression. Fibre type was an important determinant of resistance to compression. The softest fibres were alpaca, mohair and cashgora and all of the fibres measured were softer than most Merino wool. Quivet, llama, camel, guanaco, <b>vicuña,</b> yak <b>wool,</b> bison wool, dehaired cow down and Angora rabbit were also differentiated from alpaca, mohair and cashmere. There were important differences in the softness and FC of cashmere from different origins with cashmere from newer origins of production (Australia, New Zealand and USA) having lower resistance to compression than cashmere from traditional sources of China and Iran. Cashmere from different origins was differentiated on the basis of resistance to compression, FC and fibre diameter. Cashgora was differentiated from cashmere by having a lower FC and lower resistance to compression. There were minority effects of colour and fibre diameter variation on resistance to compression of cashmere. The implications of these findings for the identification and use of softer raw materials are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Cloth {{was divided}} into three classes. Awaska was used for {{household}} use, and usually made from llama wool. Finer cloth, qunpi, {{was divided into}} two classes: The first, woven by male qunpikamayuq (keepers of fine cloth) from alpaca wool, was collected as tribute from {{throughout the country and}} was used for trade, to adorn rulers and to be given as gifts to political allies and subjects to cement loyalty. The other class of qunpi ranked highest. It was woven in the Acllawasi (acllahuasi) by [...] "aclla" [...] (female virgins of the sun god temple) from <b>vicuña</b> <b>wool</b> and used solely for royal and religious use. These had thread counts of 300 or more per inch, unsurpassed anywhere in the world, until the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century.|$|E
5000|$|The wool is sold on {{the world}} market for over $300 per kg, to help support the community. In Bolivia, the Ulla Ulla National Reserve was founded in 1977 partly as a {{sanctuary}} for the species. Their numbers grew to 125,000 in Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. Since this was a ready [...] "cash crop" [...] for community members, the countries relaxed regulations on <b>vicuña</b> <b>wool</b> in 1993, enabling its trade once again. While the population levels have recovered to a healthy level, poaching remains a constant threat, as do habitat loss and other threats. Consequently, the IUCN still supports active conservation programs to protect vicuñas, though they lowered their status to least concern. The US Fish and Wildlife Service has reclassified most populations as threatened, but still lists Ecuador's population as endangered.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the citizens in each ciudadela were artisans. In the late Chimú, about 12,000 artisans {{lived and worked in}} Chan Chan alone. They engaged in fishing, agriculture, craft work, and trade. Artisans were forbidden to change their profession, and were grouped in the ciudadela according to their area of specialization. Archeologists have noted a dramatic increase in Chimú craft production, and they believe that artisans may have been brought to Chan Chan from another area taken as a result of Chimú conquest. As there is evidence of both metalwork and weaving in the same domestic unit, it is likely that both men and women were artisans. They engaged in fishing, agriculture, and metallurgy, and made ceramics and textiles from cotton, llama, alpaca, and <b>vicuña</b> <b>wool.</b> People used reed fishing canoes, hunted, and traded using bronze coins.|$|E
5000|$|Abenaki Indians {{called the}} falls Anmecangin, meaning [...] "much fish". The area was {{once part of}} Little River Plantation, a portion of which was {{incorporated}} in 1799 as Thompsonborough, then renamed in 1802 after Lisbon, Portugal. In 1806, Lisbon annexed the remainder of Little River Plantation. With water power from the Androscoggin River, Lisbon Falls became a small mill town. Before it burned down in 1987, the Worumbo Mill was the main mill in Lisbon Falls. It had been incorporated in 1864, and was world-famous for its woolens. Especially well known were its <b>vicuna</b> <b>wool</b> products, which became famous when President Eisenhower's Chief of Staff, Sherman Adams, received a vicuna sport coat as a gift from a wealthy industrialist and had to resign due to the resulting scandal. The town's primary employment is at a gypsum mill. Another large employer is Bath Iron Works, in nearby Bath, Maine.|$|E
50|$|From {{the period}} of Spanish conquest to 1964, hunting of the vicuña was unrestricted, which reduced its numbers to only 6,000 in the 1960s. As a result, the species was {{declared}} endangered in 1974, and its status prohibited the trade of <b>vicuña</b> <b>wool.</b> In Peru, during 1964-1966, the Servicio Forestal y de Caza {{in cooperation with the}} US Peace Corps, Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, and the National Agrarian University of La Molina established a nature conservatory for the vicuña called the Pampa Galeras - Barbara D'Achille in Lucanas Province, Ayacucho. During that time, a game warden academy was held in Nazca, where eight men from Peru and six from Bolivia were trained to protect the vicuña from poaching. The estimated population in Peru increased from 6,000 to 75,000 with protection by game wardens. Currently, the community of Lucanas conducts a chaccu (herding, capturing, and shearing) on the reserve each year to harvest the wool, organized by the National Council for South American Camelids (CONACS).|$|E

50|$|Chango {{communities}} were organised into either nomadic or sedentary {{groups based on}} nuclear family units. Each group was independent of the others, providing food and other resources for itself.The Changos were experts at exploiting {{the resources of the}} sea. Each group specialised in a particular type of fish, including tuna, conger eels, mullet, dart fish, mackerel and octopus. Rafts used for fishing developed from primitive reed constructions to craft made from three wooden planks, and later to seal skins fastened to wooden frames. Fish were caught using nets, hooks and harpoons.The capture of seals was of crucial importance to the Chango way of life, with every part of the animal having its uses. The meat, fat and bones were used for food and tools, the skins were used to make rafts and the intestines to make fishing equipment.As well as seal skins, the Changos used <b>vicuña</b> <b>wool,</b> feathers, bird skins, shells and the bones and teeth of sea creatures as materials to make practical and decorative items such as clothing, blankets, tools, cutlery and jewellery. They also made and painted ceramic utensils.Despite their geographical isolation, the Changos traded with inland tribes, exchanging shellfish, dried fish, animal hide, guano, fat and shells for wool, fruit, maize and coca.Chango cave paintings include images of men hunting and fishing and sea creatures such as seals, turtles and whales.|$|E
50|$|Given the town’s central location, many {{markets were}} held in Kusel even {{as far back as}} the Middle Ages, {{although}} these often had to put up with stiff competition from other traditional markets in other nearby places. The town’s economic life in the late 18th century was characterized by many small craftsmen’s workshops. There were wool and linen weavers, doublet and hose knitters, clothmakers and hatters as well as walking mills and gristmills, tanneries and several breweries. At the same time, dealers travelling overland from the town did a brisk trade with these products. In the age of industrialization, few of these craftsmen managed to expand their workshops or to switch to new, effective production methods. Thus, many small craft businesses had to cease work, and production was soon concentrated in a few bigger companies. Establishing themselves as such were a few businesses in textile manufacturing. In 1857, the Fink Brothers (their name is actually German for “Finch”) opened a cloth factory on Trierer Straße that had what were then state-of-the-art looms. This factory burnt down in 1865 and was never restored. Besides the Fink Brothers’ factory, two other great textile mills set up shop in Kusel, the Zöllner plant and the Ehrenspeck plant. At the former, it was mostly durable material that was made, for work clothes, such as tirtey (“midweight woollen fabric in twill weave, with a combination of carded woollen yarns in the weft and cotton yarns in the warp. Mostly used for work trousers.”) and buckskin cloth (not leather, but rather a “thick, smooth cotton or woollen fabric”). In 1885 the Zöllner plant, too, burnt down, but unlike the Fink Brothers’ factory, it rose from the ashes and in the years before the First World War, it even underwent an important expansion. It ﬂourished until about 1930, when the Great Depression set in. It was then taken over by Karl Hermann and run until 1958 as the Westpfälzische Tuchfabrik (“West Palatine Cloth Factory”). The Ehrenspeck plant arose from a craft business. It was built on Trierer Straße in 1867. Here, ﬁne knitted wares were made, but this plant, too, burnt down, in 1928. Later, in a portion of the plant, vigogne spinning was temporarily done (this fabric is made of natural, sometimes along with artiﬁcial, ﬁbres in imitation of <b>vicuña</b> <b>wool).</b> Moving into the factory after the Second World War was the Tuchfabrik Kahnes, which specializes in making synthetic non-woven fabrics. About 1960, the factory was moved to Haschbacher Straße. The Kahnes Cloth Factory is the only such factory that is still in business in Kusel. Besides the textile works, there were the Schleip nail factory and the Christian Gilcher machine factory in Kusel, both of which are now gone. From the several small breweries originally in town, two grew into major businesses, Koch and Emrich. Koch merged in 1972 with the Bayerische Brauerei in Kaiserslautern, and afterwards was closed. After the building was torn down, a great vacant lot was left, which later saw only minor building (an underground parking garage and the Café Rothenturm). The Emrich Brewery continued as a private brewing company until 1998, when it, too, was closed. A major production business in Kusel today is the high-speed printing machine factory, a subsidiary of Albert in Frankenthal. A computer industry production facility has also located in Kusel, the ﬁrm Owen Electronics, as has an important software business, Transware, inpremises formerly occupied by the cloth factory. The town’s economic life is otherwise represented foremost by supermarkets and retail businesses, which are housed in an industrial park beside Bundesstraße 420 between Kusel and Rammelsbach.|$|E
