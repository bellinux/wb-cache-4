40|$|A case {{of absence}} of the right common carotid artery with origin of the {{external}} carotid artery from the innominate artery and origin of the internal carotid artery from the right subclavian artery proximal to the right vertebral artery is presented. Atherosclerotic occlusion at {{the origin of the}} right subclavian artery and occlusion of the left internal carotid artery resulted in a <b>vertebrobasilar</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Blood flow from the right external carotid reconstituted the right vertebral artery via muscular collateral vessels, moving first retrograde to the subclavian artery and then antegrade through the right internal carotid artery. Symptoms were successfully relieved by transposition of the internal carotid to the external carotid artery. This is the second reported case in the literature and the first to be observed in a clinical setting. The anomaly can easily be explained by embryonic persistence of the right ductus caroticus associated with involution of the right third aortic arch...|$|E
40|$|From 1965 through 1980, 51 men and 49 women (mean age: 55 years) {{underwent}} transthoracic or extrathoracic revascularization of the innominate, common carotid, subclavian, or vertebral arteries. Preoperative {{symptoms were}} limited to the <b>vertebrobasilar</b> <b>syndrome</b> in 29 patients, to hemispheric neurologic or monocular visual events in 19, and to upper extremity ischemia in 13. Multiple symptoms were present in 27 other patients, and 12 patients were asymptomatic before operation. Median sternotomy was performed for correction of innominate, common carotid, or subclavian lesions in 34 patients, including six simultaneous brachiocephalic and cardiac procedures, with five operative deaths (14. 7 %). Extrathoracic reconstruction, such as carotosubclavian and axilloaxillary bypass or vertebral endarterectomy and reimplantation, was employed in 66 patients, with two operative strokes but no mortality (p less than. 01). Late results were obtained from two to 189 months after operation (mean: 52 months). Considering their original symptoms, 82 patients have been classified as asymptomatic or improved, nine as unchanged, and nine others, including those who had operative complications, as worse. Twelve patients have eventually sustained either transient cerebral ischemia (six) or strokes (six), {{most of which were}} unrelated to eight documented late operative failures. In addition to 20 patients who required combined brachiocephalic and carotid bifurcation reconstruction, 27 additional carotid endarterectomies have at some time been necessary for patients having extensive cerebrovascular disease. Twenty patients have died during the follow-up interval, including eight with myocardial infarctions, but only one with a fatal stroke...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{patients}} with uni-or bilateral stenosis of vertebral arteries, {{not associated with}} other lesions of supraaortic trunks are reported. They showed a <b>vertebrobasilar</b> insufficiency <b>syndrome</b> not due to other assessable causes. Seven of them underwent surgical treatment: reimplantation of the vertebral into the subclavian artery. The procedure was unilateral also in cases with bilateral lesions. In all 7 patients a favourable result was obtained: 5 patients recovered completely and 2 showed a marked improvement. The study demonstrates that the surgical repair of symptomatic unilateral lesions of vertebral arteries is able to cure the <b>vertebrobasilar</b> insufficiency <b>syndrome...</b>|$|R
40|$|The clinicoradiologic {{correlate}} {{of bilateral}} medial medullary infarction is described. This {{is a rare}} clinical entity of <b>vertebrobasilar</b> stroke <b>syndrome</b> with catastrophic consequences and a poor functional prognosis.

50|$|Anti-cardiolipin {{antibodies}} (ACA) are antibodies often {{directed against}} cardiolipin and found in several diseases, including syphilis, antiphospholipid <b>syndrome,</b> livedoid vasculitis, <b>vertebrobasilar</b> insufficiency, Behçet's <b>syndrome,</b> idiopathic spontaneous abortion, and {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE). They are a form of anti-mitochondrial antibody. In SLE, anti-DNA antibodies and anti-cardiolipin antibodies may be present individually or together; {{the two types of}} antibodies act independently. This is in contrast to rheumatoid arthritis with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) because anti-cardiolipin antibodies are present in both conditions, and therefore may tie the two conditions together.|$|R
40|$|Soft tissue {{cervical}} {{injuries are}} among the most common posttrauma problems faced by general practitioners, orthopedists and neurosurgeons. The development of the thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) following such injuries is more frequent than is generally recognized. Conservative treatment with physiotherapy, muscle relaxants, anti-inflammatory drugs and percutaneous electrostimulation usually proves effective in relieving TOS. In this series of 1, 958 soft tissue cervical injuries, 459 patients (23 percent) were diagnosed as having TOS. Of these patients, 185 (41 percent) failed to respond to all conservative measures and consequently surgical operation {{in the form of a}} supraclavicular neurovascular decompression became necessary to relieve not only the symptoms of the neck-shoulder-arm syndrome but also to relieve a frequently unrecognized (72 percent) <b>vertebrobasilar</b> artery <b>syndrome.</b> The latter is most definitely an integral part of TOS. The most common misdiagnoses were cervical disc syndrome (42 percent) and cervical strain (42 percent). A long-term follow-up (average of seven years) of 90 patients showed that the results were judged good in 75 percent, fair in 11 percent and poor in 14 percent...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Vertebrobasilar {{insufficiency}} (VBI) is {{a condition}} that results from restricted {{blood flow to the}} posterior portions of the brain, which are primarily served by the vertebral and basilar arteries. It is {{the most common cause of}} vertigo in the elderly and is usually accompanied by impaired vision and sensation. Congenital abnormalities, atherosclerosis, stroke and/or trauma may all lead to decreased <b>vertebrobasilar</b> circulation. A <b>syndrome</b> called Subclavian Steal Syndrome (SSS), which manifests with similar neurological symptoms but with a different pathophysiology, may also cause VBI. Case presentation: A middle-aged female presented with gradual onset fainting and vertigo attacks. Cardiac, auditory and autonomic etiologies were investigated and excluded. Clinical findings and presentation were highly suggestive of subclavian steal. However, subsequent CT angiography showed normal subclavian arteries. Instead, findings included a persistent right trigeminal artery (PTA), stenosis of the right proximal internal carotid artery, atresis of the left vertebral artery and distal segment of right vertebral artery, congenitally compromised changes in vertebral circulation (bilateral absence of the posterior communicating arteries (PCOMs)) and an absent anterograde vertebrobasilar circulation. Symptoms resolved after carotid endarterectomy. Discussion: Due to the absence of a normally developed posterior circulation, the PTA was the main source of blood supply for the patient. Development of recent artheromatous changes in the right internal carotid artery, however, resulted in decreased blood through PTA, further compromising posterior circulation. This resulted in vertebrobasilar insufficiency, and manifested in symptomology similar to SSS. Conclusions: This clinical encounter illustrates the relative contribution of anatomical and vasoocclusive factors in closely mimicking symptoms of subclavian steal syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{study of}} the neurogenic {{maintenance}} characteristics of the recurrent bronchitis (RB) course in children with the <b>vertebrobasilar</b> arterial system <b>syndrome</b> (VBASS) by studying the levels of the final stable metabolites of nitric oxide (FSM NO), substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) {{will make it possible}} to establish important elements of the frequent diseases respiratory tract pathogenesis. Materials and methods. Sixty children aged 7 to 11 years old with anamnesis of RB were examined. Two observation groups were formed (30 patients in each) : 1) children with RB in the period of somatic well-being and VBASS; 2) children with RB in the period of somatic well-being without VBASS. Results. In children with RB, who have VBASS, as compared to the children without VBASS, we have detected an increase in FSM NO serum levels (by 36. 7 %, p < 0. 05) (odds ratio (OR)  =  6. 50, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 82 – 23. 21, p <  0. 05), substance P (by 40. 0 %, p < 0. 05) (OR = 6. 00, 95 % CI 1. 89 – 19. 04, p <  0. 05), a decrease in concentration of VIP (by 26. 7 %, p <  0. 05) (OR =  3. 05, 95 % CI 1. 05 – 8. 84, p < 0. 05) statistically significantly more often. Conclusions. In children with RB and VBASS, during the period of somatic well-being, the focus of the neurogenic inflammatory process takes place, which is accompanied by an autonomous neuronal processes imbalance and predisposition to recurrent bronchopulmonary pathology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The use of {{conventional}} modalities for chronic neck pain remains debatable, primarily because most treatments have had limited success. We conducted {{a review of}} the literature published up to December 2013 on the diagnostic and treatment modalities of disorders related to chronic neck pain and concluded that, despite providing temporary relief of symptoms, these treatments do not address the specific problems of healing and are not likely to offer long-term cures. The objectives of this narrative review are to provide an overview of chronic neck pain as it relates to cervical instability, to describe the anatomical features of the cervical spine and the impact of capsular ligament laxity, to discuss the disorders causing chronic neck pain and their current treatments, and lastly, to present prolotherapy as a viable treatment option that heals injured ligaments, restores stability to the spine, and resolves chronic neck pain. The capsular ligaments are the main stabilizing structures of the facet joints in the cervical spine and have been implicated as a major source of chronic neck pain. Chronic neck pain often reflects a state of instability in the cervical spine and is a symptom common to a number of conditions described herein, including disc herniation, cervical spondylosis, whiplash injury and whiplash associated disorder, postconcussion <b>syndrome,</b> <b>vertebrobasilar</b> insufficiency, and Barré-Liéou syndrome. When the capsular ligaments are injured, they become elongated and exhibit laxity, which causes excessive movement of the cervical vertebrae. In the upper cervical spine (C 0 -C 2), this can cause a number of other symptoms including, but no...|$|R

40|$|Women {{are known}} to have {{particular}} heterogeneity in stroke etiology related to childbearing and hormonal factors. Although there are continued acute stroke treatment advances focusing on clot dissolution or extraction, effective secondary prevention of stroke, however, is dependent on an accurate etiological determination of the stroke. Otherwise, more strokes are likely to follow. Analysis of young women’s stroke etiology in a large stroke registry incorporating contemporary neurovascular and parenchymal imaging and cardiac imaging. Young people (18 - 49 years old) with stroke were consecutively accrued over a 4 year period and an investigative protocol prospectively applied that incorporated multimodality magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, cardiac echo and stroke relevant blood investigations. All patients were classified according to an expanded Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment − TOAST − classification and neurological deficit by the National Institute of Health stroke admission scores. In 511 registry derived, young stroke patients (mean age 39. 8 years, 95 % confidence interval: 39. 1; 40. 7 years), gender (women n= 269, 53 %) the etiological categories (women; men) included: i) small vessel disease (30 / 55; 25 / 55), ii) cardioembolic (16 / 42; 26 / 42), iii) large vessel cervical and intracranial disease (24 / 43; 19 / 43), the other category (132 / 226; 91 / 226), which included, iv) substance abuse (15 / 41; 26 / 41, 4. 6), v) prothrombotic states (22 / 37; 15 / 37), vi) dissection (11 / 30; 19 / 30), vii) cerebral venous thrombosis (15 / 19; 4 / 19, 12. 4), viii) vasculitis (8 / 12; 4 / 12), ix) migraine related (10 / 11, 1 / 11) and x) miscellaneous vasculopathy (38 / 52; 14 / 52). The latter entities comprised of aortic arch atheroma, vessel redundancy <b>syndrome,</b> <b>vertebrobasilar</b> hypoplasia, arterial fenestrations and dolichoectasia. Some conditions occurred solely in women, such as eclampsia (5), Call Fleming syndrome (4), fibromuscular dysplasia (3) and Moya Moya syndrome (2). Categories aside from bland infarction included: ii) intracerebral hemorrhage (43 / 106; 63 / 106) and xiii) stroke of undetermined etiology (6 / 10; 4 / 10). Admission mean National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores differed significantly between women and men (4. 7; 6. 0 t= 1. 8, P= 0. 03). Young women’s stroke is significantly different from men in 7 / 12 stroke etiological categories in addition to 4 unique subtypes that require specific management...|$|R
