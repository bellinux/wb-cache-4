5|$|In {{common with}} {{other areas of}} South Australia, and Australia as a whole, {{settlers}} on the frontier employed various tactics to deal with Aboriginal resistance to being forced off their traditional lands. Initially, these revolved around keeping them at a distance using threats of violence, but they soon escalated to terrorising Aboriginal people to stop them interfering with stock and other property, tactics which sometimes included violent clashes. <b>Violence</b> <b>by</b> settlers towards Aboriginal people often went unreported to the authorities, and became more secretive after a settler was hanged in March 1847 for murdering an Aboriginal man in the south east of the colony, the only such sentence {{in the history of}} South Australia's early white settlement.

5|$|On 27 February 2002, a train {{carrying}} Hindu pilgrims {{was burned}} {{outside the town}} of Godhra, killing 59 people. The incident {{was seen as an}} attack upon Hindus, and sparked off massive anti-Muslim violence across the state of Gujarat that lasted several weeks. The death toll estimated was as high as 2000, while 150,000 were displaced. Rape, mutilation, and torture were also widespread. The then-Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and several high-ranking government officials were accused of initiating and condoning the violence, as were police officers who allegedly directed the rioters and gave them lists of Muslim-owned properties. In April 2009, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate and expedite the Gujarat riots cases. In 2012, Modi was cleared of complicity in the <b>violence</b> <b>by</b> the SIT and BJP MLA Maya Kodnani, who later held a cabinet portfolio in the Modi government, was convicted of having orchestrated one of the riots and sentenced to 28 years imprisonment. Scholars such as Paul Brass, Martha Nussbaum and Dipankar Gupta have said that there was a high level of state complicity in the incidents.|$|E

5|$|East Timor's {{ballot in}} favour of {{independence}} after 24 years of Indonesian occupation on 30 August 1999 resulted {{in a wave of}} <b>violence</b> <b>by</b> militia groups and pro-integration factions within the Indonesian military. 2, 3 and 5/7 RAR were subsequently deployed from 20 September 1999 as part of the UN-sanctioned International Force for East Timor (INTERFET), charged with restoring peace and overseeing the Indonesian departure. Despite minor clashes, including a contact at Motaain on the Indonesian border on 10 October 1999, control was quickly established and INTERFET handed over to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) in February 2000. At this time, 5/7 RAR become the first battalion of the regiment to serve under UN command since the Korean War. From 1999 to 2004, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5/7, and 6 RAR would all serve in East Timor twice, giving the regiment a wealth of operational experience. One soldier was accidentally killed during these operations, while several more were wounded. Two years after being withdrawn, the deteriorating situation in the country—by then known as Timor Leste—again saw units of the regiment deployed to conduct stabilisation and security operations, this time under Operation Astute. In response to the initial crisis, 3 RAR was deployed along with special forces from 4 RAR (Commando) and the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) in May 2006. It was replaced in early September by a combined Australian and New Zealand battle group based on 6 RAR, designated the ANZAC Battle Group. Subsequent rotations included elements of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8/9 RAR in the years that followed. After a phased drawdown, the last elements were withdrawn in 2013. Events in East Timor largely overshadowed developments in Solomon Islands, where elements of the regiment also served periodically from 2003 onwards. One member of the regiment died during operations in the Solomon Islands.|$|E
