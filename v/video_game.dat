To inform strategies aimed at reducing sedentary behavior by replacing non-active by active gaming, opinions about active and non-active <b>video</b> <b>games</b> are explored among 8 -to 12 -year-old children and their parents. Six qualitative, semi-structured focus groups were held with 8 - to 12 -year-old children (n 46) and four with their parents (n 19) at three different primary schools in The Netherlands. The focus groups with children dis-cussed game preferences, gaming context and perceived game-related parenting. The focus groups with parents addressed considerations in purchasing <b>video</b> <b>games,</b> per-ceived positive and negative consequences of gaming, and game-related parenting. Both children and their parents were very positive about active <b>video</b> <b>games</b> and preferred active games over non-active <b>games.</b> Active <b>video</b> <b>games</b> were considered more social than non-active <b>video</b> <b>games,</b> and active games were played more often together with friends and family than non-active <b>video</b> <b>games.</b> Parenting practices did not differ for active and non-active <b>video</b> <b>games,</b> al-though some parents were less strict regarding active games. Two conditions for practical implementation were met: children enjoyed active <b>video</b> <b>games,</b> and parents were willing to buy active <b>video</b> <b>games.</b> Active <b>video</b> <b>games</b> were preferred to non-active <b>video</b> <b>games,</b> illustrating that using active <b>video</b> <b>games</b> is a promising health promotion tool to reduce sedentary pastime in youth.

40|$|Across the world, <b>video</b> <b>games</b> are {{becoming}} one of the more popular pastimes for children. Many of the <b>video</b> <b>games</b> that have become incredibly popular tend to involve violence. This study was created in order to answer whether these violent <b>video</b> <b>games</b> actually affect the aggression in its adolescent players so that parents can make better decisions on whether their children should play violent <b>video</b> <b>games.</b> In this study, tenth and eleventh grade students were surveyed on who long they played violent <b>video</b> <b>games</b> followed by a five point scale using questions adapted from the “State Hostility Scale” asking how hostile those who play violent <b>video</b> <b>games</b> get when they play. The amount of time spent playing these violent <b>video</b> <b>games</b> allowed the separation of subjects into categories based on play time which led to the comparison of hostile feelings between those categories. The questions from the “State Hostility Scale” have questions that describe four different feelings separated into categories: unsociable, aggression, mean, and lack positive feelings. Based on the data that was collected, there is a slightly positive correlation between unsociable feelings and the amount of violent <b>video</b> <b>games</b> played. There is also a positive correlation between the amount of aggressive and mean feelings experienced while playing violent <b>video</b> <b>games,</b> and the amount of violent <b>video</b> <b>games</b> played.

However, their use in schools is still far from mainstream practice, which could be because of the barriers such as the price of <b>video</b> <b>games,</b> schools’ technological infrastructures and teachers’ attitudes. This article focuses on pre-service primary school teachers’ attitudes (future primary school teachers currently studying at university) towards collaborative learning with <b>video</b> <b>games,</b> which employs <b>video</b> <b>games</b> in collaborative learning activities. Because playing <b>video</b> <b>games</b> is a common form of entertainment for higher education students, we investigate whether pre-service teachers’ attitudes are influenced by their experience of playing <b>video</b> <b>games</b> (taking into account the number of years they have played <b>video</b> <b>games),</b> the frequency at which they play <b>video</b> <b>games</b> and their gender. This study takes a quantitative approach, using a questionnaire with a 5 -point Likert attitude scale. The results indicate that pre-service primary teachers have a positive attitude towards collaborative learning with <b>video</b> <b>games.</b> Furthermore, students who have played <b>video</b> <b>games</b> for more years, who play more frequently and the male students have more positive attitudes to using <b>video</b> <b>games</b> in collaborative learning activities. Overall, pre-service teachers have positive attitudes towards collaborative learning with <b>video</b> <b>games,</b> which could affect the use of these resources in educational practices. As the main characters in the educational process, both teachers and children need to be comfortable with new practices to achieve the objective of the educational system, which is the complete formation of children.|$|R
