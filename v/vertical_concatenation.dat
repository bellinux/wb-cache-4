40|$|Concatenation is the {{adjoining}} (juxtaposition) of two patterns {{to form a}} larger one. There are two forms of pattern concatenation: horizontal, in which patterns are adjoined at their vertical edges, and horizontal, in which patterns are adjoined at their horizontal edges. We’ll indicate horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>concatenation</b> by the symbols and, respectively. In order for concatenation to be possible, {{the adjoining}} edges must be of the same length [1]: for the horizontal concatenation of patterns P and Q, η(P) = η(Q) for the <b>vertical</b> <b>concatenation</b> of patterns P and Q, ω(P) = ω(Q) Figures 1 and 2 show examples of horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>concatenation.</b> P...|$|E
40|$|John Hughes {{has made}} pretty {{printers}} {{one of the}} prime demonstrations of using combinators to develop a library, and algebra to implement it. This note presents a new design for pretty printers which improves on Hughes's classic design. The new design is based on a single concatenation operator which is associative and has a left and right unit. Hughes's design requires two separate operators for concatenation, where horizontal concatenation has a right unit but no left unit, and <b>vertical</b> <b>concatenation</b> has neither unit...|$|E
40|$|A set of {{one-line}} text-book-style mathematical expressions {{is defined}} by a context free grammar. This grammar generates strings which describe the expressions in terms of mathematical symbols and some simple positional operators, such as <b>vertical</b> <b>concatenation.</b> The grammar rules are processed to abstract information used to drive the parsing scheme. This has been called syntax-controlled as opposed to syntax-directed analysis. The parsing scheme consists of two operations. First, the X-Y plane is searched {{in such a way}} that the mathematical characters are picked up in a unique order. Then, the resulting character string is parsed using a precedence algorithm with certain modifications for special cases. The search of the X-Y plane is directed by the particular characters encountered...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{categories}} of representations of compact quantum groups of automorphisms of certain inclusions of finite dimensional C ∗-algebras are {{shown to be}} isomorphic to the {{categories of}} Fuss-Catalan diagrams. A Fuss-Catalan diagram is a planar diagram formed by an upper row of 4 m points, a lower row of 4 n points and by 2 m + 2 n non-crossing strings joining them. Both rows of points are colored {{from left to right}} in the following standard way white, black, black, white, white, black, black, [...] . and the strings have to join pairs of points having the same color. The tensor C ∗-category FC is defined as follows. The objects are the positive integers. The arrows between m and n are the linear combinations of such diagrams. The operations ◦, ⊗ and ∗ are induced by <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>concatenation</b> and upside-down turning of diagrams. With the following rule: erasing a black/white circle is the same as multiplying by β/ω, where β and ω are some fixed positive numbers. In [6] Bisch and Jones study the algebras FC(m, m) are prove that they are isomorphic to the algebras associated to intermediate subfactors of indices β 2 and ω 2...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} {{developed}} a solution algorithm for linear rational expectation models under imperfect information. Imperfect information in this paper means that some decision makings are based on smaller information sets than others. The algorithm generates the solution {{in the form of}} k_t+ 1 = Hk_t + Jx,S f_t = Fk_t + Gx,S where k_t and f_t are column vectors of crawling and jump variables, respectively, while x,S is the <b>vertical</b> <b>concatenation</b> of the column vectors of past and present innovations. The technical breakthrough in this article is made by expanding the innovation vector, rather than expanding the set of crawling variables. Perhaps surprisingly, the H and F matrices are the same as those under the corresponding perfect information models. This implies that if the corresponding perfect information model is saddle path stable (sunspot, explosive), the imperfect model is also saddle-path stable (sunspot, explosive, respectively). Moreover, if the minimum information set in the model has all the information up to time t-S- 1, then the direct effects on the impulse response functions last for only the first S periods after the impulse. In the subsequent dates, impulse response functions follow essentially the same process as in the perfect information counterpart. However, imperfect information can significantly alter the quantitative properties of a model, though it does not drastically change its qualitative nature. This article demonstrates, as an example, that adding imperfect information to the standard RBC models remarkably improves the correlation between labour productivity and output. Hence, a robustness check for information structure is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Suppose we have M {{images that}} are indexed by i, and each image has N pixels that are indexed by j. The {{intensity}} of j-th pixel in i-th image is therefore denoted as Ii,j. At j-th pixel, denote nj the surface normal, ρj the albedo, and bj = ρjnj the scaled normal. Note that these quantities are the same across all images and therefore independent of i. Each image comes from a different lighting environment, which has a different rendering function Ri (·), written as Ii,j = ρjRi (nj), (1) and we consider following rendering models in this note. 1. Directional lighting (distant point light source) Ri (n) = max{`>i n, 0 }. (2) 2. Directional lighting plus an ambient component (first order spherical harmonics 1) Ri (n) = max{`>i n+ αi, 0 }. (3) We also define λi = ‖`i‖, ̂̀i = `i λi, (4) where λi is the strength of i-th lighing, and ̂̀i is a unit vector for direction of i-th lighting. The goal of photometric stereo is to recover the scene property {ρj,nj} from the intensity measurements Ii,j, given (fully or partially) calibrated lighting environmentRi (·). 2 Fully Calibrated Lighting 2. 1 Directional lighting For notational simplicity, we first only consider pixels {{that are not in}} shadow, and drop the max{·, 0 } part of the rendering function Ii,j = ρj` i nj = ` i bj.
