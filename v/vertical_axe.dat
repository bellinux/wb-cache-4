The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Photogrammetry covers the gap between classical manned aerial photogrammetry and hand- made surveying techniques because it works in the close-range domain, combining aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry, but also introduces low-cost alternatives. The aim of this work is developing of an accurate and low-cost method to characterize landslides located on the size of a road. It was applied at the kilometric point 339 belonging to the A 92 dual carriageway, in the Abla municipal term, province of Almeria, Spain.

40|$|Experimental {{tests on}} {{seed-bed}} preparation {{by means of}} three rotary harrows (with tools rotating on a <b>vertical</b> <b>axe)</b> and three rotary hoes (with tools rotating on an horizontal axe) were performed during 1996 on a loam soil at the Experimental Center for Agro-Environment Research “E. Avanzi” of the University of Pisa (Italy). Both the mechanical and operative performances (working time and capacity, fuel consumption, power requirement, etc.) {{and the quality of}} work (clod size distribution and soil roughness) were evaluated. 	The results emphasized that there were no relevant differences between the operative performances of the two typologies of machines tested. Thus specific power (usable power per meter of working width and centimeter of working depth) both of rotary harrows and rotary hoes was always of the same order. In contrast seed-bed quality was notably different. Use of rotary hoes led to a high degree of soil crumbling, which was also homogeneous throughout the tilled layer, while rotary harrows resulted in a lower degree of soil crumbling, with a distribution of larger diameter clods in the shallowest layer. As a consequence, soil roughness was decidedly higher after harrowing. 	Therefore, given the absence of significant differences between the operative performances of the two typologies of pto powered operative machines, choice of implement can be based on desired seed-bed quality, in order to obtain either pronounced soil crumbling and leveling (rotary hoe) or greater “protection” of tilled soil from crusting and erosion (rotary harrow) ...|$|E

Because it is new, Honeycrisp {{has not been}} well studied {{and there is little}} {{information}} available to make recommendations about specific horticultural practices. Chemical thinning is important for managing crop load, fruit size and quality, and for increasing return bloom of apple. The optimal thinning chemistries and rates are variety specific. This study was initiated to evaluate the effect of chemical thinners on fruit set, yield, fruit size, and fruit quality of Honeycrisp. Materials and Methods These studies were conducted in a commercial orchard in Milton, NY, in 1999, 2000, and 2001 on fifth, sixth, and seventh leaf Honeycrisp/M. 26 trees, respectively. To avoid complications due to differences in bloom density, different trees were used in each year. The trees were planted at 8 X 16 ft. spacing with trickle irrigation, and trained to the <b>vertical</b> <b>axe</b> system. Chemical thinners were applied to drip with an air-blast sprayer when the largest fruit were 10 - 12 mm in diameter. The flower clusters on one or two scaffold limbs per tree were counted at bloom and the number of fruits remaining after June drop were counted on the same limbs. Fruit set was calculated as the ratio of fruits per 100 flower clusters. The fruit were harvested in three or four pickings each season and weighed. The total yield per tree was the sum of all harvests. A sample of 20 fruits per tree was evaluated Since Honeycrisp is a new variety, optimal thinning chemistries and rates are unknown. Based on this research, Honeycrisp is relatively easy to thin chemically at the traditional 10 - 12 mm growth stage. Best results were with NAA at 5 ppm, or the combination of 2. 5 NAA plus 1 pint Sevin XLR/ 100 gal. Honeycrisp appears to be very sensitive to benzyladenine (Accel), and is easily over-thinned with this chemical...|$|E
