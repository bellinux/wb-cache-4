5|$|The highway {{continues}} {{parallel to}} the state line from the Marensico area through the national forest toward Watersmeet. That unincorporated community {{is the home of}} the Watersmeet High School Nimrods, the basketball team featured on a series of ESPN commercials and a documentary series on the Sundance Channel. The area is also where the waters meet; the rolling hills drain to Lake Superior via the Ontonagon River, to Lake Michigan via the Brule and Menominee rivers, or to the Gulf of Mexico via the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers. Also located in the area are the Sylvania Wilderness, and the Lac <b>Vieux</b> Desert Indian Reservation, which includes the Lac <b>Vieux</b> Desert Casino and Resort. The highway travels southeasterly from Watersmeet around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural Iron County. US2 intersects Federal Forest Highway 16 (FFH16) near Golden Lake in Stambaugh Township {{in the middle of the}} national forest. The trunkline then runs along the Iron River as it approaches the city of the same name and meets M‑73. In town, US2 intersects M‑189 before crossing the river and turning northeast out of the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservations}} in Wisconsin {{were named}} the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation, and Lac du Flambeau Indian Reservation. The La Pointe Band {{was given a}} reservation at Bad River around the Band's traditional wild ricing grounds on the south shore of Lake Superior, and some reserved land for fishing grounds at the eastern tip of Madeline Island. In Minnesota, the reservations for the Fond du Lac and the Grand Portage bands were established, with pending negotiations promised for the Bois Forte Band. In Michigan, reservations for the Lac <b>Vieux</b> Desert, Ontonagon and L'Anse bands were established. The St. Croix and Sokaogon bands left the negotiations in protest and {{were excluded from the}} agreement.|$|E
5|$|Following a long {{fight against}} cancer, {{spending}} {{most of the last}} year of his life in and out of hospital, Odlum died on 28 September 2003 in Tapion Hospital, Castries, aged 69. The body lay in state on 5 October, where it was viewed by Pearlette Louisy, Kenny Anthony, and members of the Cabinet. Odlum's funeral was held on 6 October, with a 30-vehicle procession travelling from <b>Vieux</b> Fort to Castries; it was led by a pair of police outriders and a coach carrying the coffin, draped in the national flag. St Lucian citizens were reported to be openly weeping at Odlum's death. The funeral itself was held in a park, due to no church in Castries being large enough to hold the number of mourners. During the service, sections of his most famous speeches were broadcast from loudspeakers. James Fletcher, a Cabinet Secretary, had previously announced that all flags would be flown at half-mast for the day as a tribute.|$|E
5|$|Power outages {{began in}} some neighborhoods at 6:30p.m. AST (2230 UTC) August 16, over 12hours {{before the storm}} arrived, and quickly spread over the entire island. The night saw heavy rains, 4cm (1.58inches) at Hewanorra International Airport, and intense {{thunderstorms}} and by morning hurricane-force winds peaked at 80knots (90mph, 145km/h). The winds uprooted trees, downed electricity poles, disabled bridges, triggered landslides, and damaged several roofs. Hurricane Dean tore the corrugated metal roof off Victoria Hospital's pediatric ward, but its patients had already been evacuated. St. Jude Hospital in <b>Vieux</b> Fort was also damaged when part of the roof blew off its medical ward and fell through {{the roof of the}} emergency room. A section of the cafeteria also lost its roof, but no one was injured in either incident.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler and {{the brigade}} arrived in Italy on 20 November, and {{proceeded}} through the Italian Riviera to reach Caporetto, {{where it had}} been sent to bolster the Italian troops against a German and Austro-Hungarian advance. As the Russian Republic removed itself from the war, the German Army refocused its efforts on the Western Front, and so in March 1918 Wheeler's brigade was ordered to leave Italy, getting a train from Castelfranco to <b>Vieux</b> Rouen in France. Back on the Western Front, the brigade was assigned to the 2nd Division, again part of Julian Byng's Third Army, reaching a stable area of the front in April. Here, Wheeler was engaged in artillery fire for several months, before the British went on the offensive in August. On 24 August, in between the ruined villages of Achiet and Sapignies, he led an expedition which captured two German field guns while under heavy fire from a castle mound; he was later awarded the Military Cross for this action. Wheeler continued as part of the British forces pushing westward until the German surrender in November 1918. He was not demobilised for several months, instead being stationed at Pulheim in Germany until March; during this time he wrote up his earlier research on Romano-Rhenish pottery, making use of access to local museums, before returning to London in July 1919.|$|E
25|$|The plan to {{construct}} an elevated Riverfront Expressway between the Mississippi River levee and the French Quarter consumed the attention of <b>Vieux</b> Carré preservationists {{through much of the}} 1960s. On December 21, 1965, the <b>Vieux</b> Carre Historic District was designated a National Historic Landmark. After waging a decade-long battle against the <b>Vieux</b> Carré Riverfront Expressway that utilized the newly passed National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, preservationists and their allies forced the issue into federal court, eventually producing the cancellation of the freeway plan in 1969.|$|E

25|$|The Saint-Antoine {{district}} is centred around the Place aux Herbes and the historic heart despite its relative {{distance from the}} Town Hall. This district covers {{the northern part of}} the town centre; it is crossed by the rue de Strasbourg and consists of narrow lanes. There is the prefecture (district headquarters) of Saône-et-Loire and the old Saint-Vincent Cathedral (<b>Vieux</b> Saint-Vincent).|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the medieval}} centuries, the city was {{composed}} of six separate fortified towns, juxtaposed and aligned on an east-west axis, where the original core was ordered around the cathedral.

25|$|Even {{after its}} {{complete}} transformation into a red wine region, {{the reputation of}} Pomerol still lagged far behind that of the Médoc. A 1943 comparative price list commissioned by the Vichy government listed Pétrus only {{at the level of}} a mid-tier Second Growth from the Médoc with the next highest rated Pomerol estates, <b>Vieux</b> Château Certan and Château La Conseillante commanding prices in line with Third Growth estates like Château Giscours and Château La Lagune.|$|E
25|$|Biva {{was born}} in Paris, where his family lived in Montmartre, 18 rue du <b>Vieux</b> Chemin de Paris (named rue Ravignan after 1867), and it is from {{designer}} Charles Biva (1821–1884), father of Henri Biva and Paul Biva that the family developed its artistic talents. In 1845, motivated by the fashion of the time for bourgeois interior ornamentation, Charles Biva opened a wallpaper factory in a northern suburb of Paris where his sons Henri and Paul began their apprenticeship as designers and colorists.|$|E
25|$|Run by Ramzi and Sami Ghosn, Massaya is a {{boutique}} winery that marked {{a turning point}} because of the financial involvement of French wine dynasties (<b>Vieux</b> Telegraphe and Cheval Blanc) and quick international market success. Indeed, the features on CNN, BBC, Travel Channel, TV5... and in the New York Times, Decanter... are bolstering Lebanon's leading position in the Ancient World Wine category. Beside the Gold Reserve, Massaya is reputed for its Vineyard restaurant and the hospitality of its tasting room.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the Quarter's cheap rents and air of decay {{attracted}} a bohemian artistic community, a trend which became {{pronounced in the}} 1920s. Many of these new inhabitants were active in the first preservation efforts in the Quarter, which began around that time. As a result, the <b>Vieux</b> Carré Commission (VCC) was established in 1925. Although initially only an advisory body, a 1936 referendum to amend the Louisiana constitution afforded it a measure of regulatory power. It began to exercise more power in the 1940s to preserve and protect the district.|$|E
25|$|Salif Keita, a noble-born Malian {{who became}} a singer, brought Mande-based Afro-pop to the world, {{adopting}} traditional garb and styles. He says he sings to express himself, however, {{and not as a}} traditional jeli or praise-singer. The kora players Sidiki Diabaté and Toumani Diabaté have also achieved some international prominence as have the late Songhai/Fula guitarist Ali Farka Touré and his successors Afel Bocoum and <b>Vieux</b> Farka Touré, the Tuareg band Tinariwen, the duo Amadou et Mariam and Oumou Sangare. Mory Kanté saw major mainstream success with techno-influenced Mande music.|$|E
25|$|The {{city has}} {{the fourth largest}} theatre in Quebec, the Maurice O'Bready University Cultural Centre of Sherbrooke. Music, theatre, and dance shows are staged there.

25|$|Since {{their chance}} meeting {{at an airport}} in 2008, Raichel and <b>Vieux</b> Farka Touré, son of Ali Farka Toure, have formed The Touré-Raichel Collective, a {{collaboration}} of Malian and Israeli music. He was invited to Israel to perform at the Tel Aviv Opera House with Raichel in 2010, {{which led to the}} formation of The Toure-Raichel Collective. This album The Tel Aviv Session reached the number one spot on the iTunes World Music sales charts and made number 2 on the Billboard World Music Chart. In September 2014, The Touré-Raichel Collective released its second album, The Paris Session with Daby Touré on bass, Israeli trumpeter Niv Toar, Malian singer Seckouba Diabate and others.|$|E
25|$|New Orleans is world-famous for its {{abundance}} of architectural styles {{that reflect the}} city's multicultural heritage. Though New Orleans possesses numerous structures of national architectural significance, it is equally, if not more, revered for its enormous, largely intact (even post-Katrina) historic built environment. Twenty National Register Historic Districts have been established, and fourteen local historic districts aid in preservation. Thirteen of the districts are administered by the New Orleans Historic District Landmarks Commission (HDLC), while one—the French Quarter—is administered by the <b>Vieux</b> Carre Commission (VCC). Additionally, both the National Park Service, via the National Register of Historic Places, and the HDLC have landmarked individual buildings, many of which lie outside the boundaries of existing historic districts.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, World War II brought {{thousands}} of servicemen and war workers to New Orleans {{as well as}} to the surrounding region's military bases and shipyards. Many of these sojourners paid visits to the <b>Vieux</b> Carré. Although nightlife and vice had already begun to coalesce on Bourbon Street in the two decades following the closure of Storyville, the war produced a larger, more permanent presence of exotic, risqué, and often raucous entertainment on what became the city's most famous strip. Years of repeated crackdowns on vice in Bourbon Street clubs, which took on new urgency under Mayor deLesseps Story Morrison, reached a crescendo with District Attorney Jim Garrison's raids in 1962, but Bourbon Street's clubs were soon back in business.|$|E
