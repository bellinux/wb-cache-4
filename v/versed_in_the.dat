He was <b>versed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Latin classics and maintained a sizeable estate, but the law was his primary concern. Francis Bacon, his main competitor, {{was known as a}} philosopher and man of learning, but Coke had no interest in such subjects. Notably, when given a copy of the Novum Organum by Bacon, Coke wrote puerile insults in it.|$|E
5|$|On 13–14 May, the Germans were vulnerable. A strong {{attack at}} this point by the French {{armoured}} units could have prevented Guderian from breaking out of the Meuse bridgeheads and changed {{the outcome of the}} campaign. However, the French commanders, already deeply schooled and <b>versed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rather staunchly defensively-focused broad, generalized doctrine of methodological warfare, were located far to the rear, which meant they lacked a real-time and up-to-date picture of the battle. When intelligence did filter through, it was out-of-date. This was to prove fatal, especially coupled with the case of the matter that the French generalship at large was expecting a considerably more prolonged process of initial German assault phase and overall attack effort as a whole.|$|E
5|$|One {{significant}} factor in the decline was the rise of grunge music from Seattle, with bands including Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. This was particularly obvious after the success of Nirvana's Nevermind (1991), which combined elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a dirty sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion, fuzz and feedback, along with darker lyrical themes, a stripped-down aesthetic and a complete rejection of the glam metal visual style and performance. Many major labels felt they had been caught off-guard by the surprise success of grunge and began turning over their personnel in favor of younger staffers more <b>versed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new scene. As MTV shifted its attention to the new style, glam metal bands found themselves relegated increasingly to late night airplay, and Headbanger's Ball was cancelled {{at the end of}} 1994, while KNAC went over to Spanish programming. Given glam metal's lack of a major format presence on radio, bands were left without a clear way to reach their audience. Other (earlier Hollywood) alternative rock bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Jane's Addiction also helped supplant the popularity of the genre.|$|E

25|$|The first bilingual {{renderings of}} {{religious}} texts are those by Étienne de Flacourt, who also published the first dictionary of the language. Radama I, the first literate {{representative of the}} Merina monarchy, though extensively <b>versed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arabico-Malagasy tradition, opted in 1823 for a Latin system derived by David Jones and invited the Protestant London Missionary Society to establish schools and churches.

The Lakers signed him in order to add stability at the point and they needed a player who was well <b>versed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> triangle offense.

25|$|Having {{experienced}} the rigidity of the caste {{system and the}} dogmatism of scriptural learning, Dnyaneshwar was sympathetic towards issues of the common people. He chose the new vernacular Marathi language, {{as opposed to the}} classical Sanskrit language, as a means of expression so that spiritual learning could reach the masses who weren't well <b>versed</b> <b>in</b> Sanskrit. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 13th century, his works presented a departure from the prevailing socio–cultural ethos of high–caste Hinduism, a trend which continued with other bhakti poets across India.|$|R

25|$|Sambhāvanā (Hindi: सम्भावना, meaning Competency): Sambhāvanā or {{competency}} is vividly {{described in}} the first ten verses of the canto. Aṣṭāvakra is brimming with confidence as he approaches Mithilā. Mithilā is replete with scholars <b>versed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Vedas and all the six Āstika schools. The twelve-year olds Aṣṭāvakra and Śvetaketu run into Janaka, who {{is on his way}} to the court. Janaka asks his guards to get the handicapped boy out of his way. Aṣṭāvakra responds by saying that Janaka should get out of his way instead, as he (Aṣṭāvakra) is a Brāhmaṇa <b>versed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scriptures. Pleased with his brilliance, Janaka tells Aṣṭāvakra that he is free to roam anywhere in Mithilā. However, Janaka's gatekeeper does not let Aṣṭāvakra into the court, and tells him that only the learned and wise elders deserve to be in Janaka's court. Aṣṭāvakra makes the gatekeeper speechless by his definition of elders – only those grown in knowledge are the elders. The gatekeeper now lets him into an assembly consisting of sages like Yājñavalkya, Gārgī and Maitreyī. Aṣṭāvakra openly challenges Bandī for a scriptural debate. Janaka asks Aṣṭāvakra to satisfy him first in debate, and poses him six cryptic questions, which Aṣṭāvakra answers convincingly. Janaka offers him Bandī, who knows within himself he will lose to Aṣṭāvakra, but decides to openly debate. Bandī mocks Aṣṭāvakra's deformities and the assembly laughs. Aṣṭāvakra chides both Bandī and the assembly and declares his intention to leave the assembly.|$|E
25|$|Surgery was {{formally}} taught in Italy {{even though it}} was initially looked down upon as a lower form of medicine. The most important figure of the formal learning of surgery was Guy de Chauliac. He insisted that a proper surgeon should have a specific knowledge of the human body such as anatomy, food and diet of the patient, and other ailments that may have affected the patients. Not only should surgeons have knowledge about the body but they should also be well <b>versed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> liberal arts. In this way, surgery was no longer regarded as a lower practice, but instead began to be respected and gain esteem and status.|$|E
25|$|The book The Dance of Change states {{there are}} many reasons why an {{organization}} may have trouble in transforming itself into a learning organization. The first is that an organization does not have enough time. Employees and management may have other issues that take priority over trying to change the culture of their organization. The team {{may not be able to}} commit the time if an institution does not have the appropriate help or training. For an organization to be able to change, it needs to know the steps necessary to solve the problems it faces.

One of his rulings was to split a region from the Viceroyalty of Perú and create instead the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, with Buenos Aires as the capital. However, Charles's placating actions did not have the desired effect, and the porteños, some of them <b>versed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ideology of the French Revolution, became even more convinced of the need for independence from Spain.|$|E

He praised the Me'or 'Enayim of Azariah dei Rossi in spite of the anathema that his master, Judah ben Bezalel, whom he held in great esteem, had launched against the book and its author. His statement on the universal dignity of humanity is also notable, as is his openness to study of works by non-Jews.

Poetry analysis continued to use the same poems and poets the students were exposed to in Ludus, such as Phoenissae by Euripides.

We then make recommendations as to how each of these difficulties may be overcome. ResultsTo ensure that models can inform the actual decision, modellers should understand <b>the</b> environment <b>in</b> which decision-makers operate, including full knowledge of the stakeholders' key issues and requirements.
