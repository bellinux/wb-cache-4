Dietary habits have been much associated with its development and persistence during and following periodontal treatment. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of vinegars on the removal of smear layer and exposure of dentinal tubules. Extracted human teeth were submitted to manual scaling with Gracey curettes in order to remove the cementum {{as well as to}} form a smear layer. Dentin samples with 3 mm(2) were obtained and distributed into six experimental groups: one control and five types of <b>vinegars</b> (<b>alcohol,</b> apple, rice, white wine and balsamic). Each group included two methods of vinegar application: topical and friction. After routine preparation for SEM analysis, photomicrographs were assessed by a calibrated and blind examiner using an appropriate index system. Kruskal-Wallis test indicated a significant influence of vinegars on smear layer removal. There was a statistically significant difference between groups treated with apple, white and rice vinegars and the control group (p < 0. 05). Nevertheless, Mann-Whitney test indicated that removal of smear layer did not vary with the method of application (topical versus friction) for any of the tested substances. We can conclude that the contact of vinegar may remove smear layer and expose dentinal tubules, regardless of the type of application. However, balsamic vinegar was associated with less removal of smear layer after both methods of application...|$|R

A more comprehensive explanation of these methods will {{be found in the}} upcoming book, Well Preserved: The Story of Food Preservation and Storage in the Nineteenth Century. The book will contain more details for each preservation method and include documented recipes for each process. Stay tuned for the publication date. ] Before the age of commercial canning, freezing, refrigeration and freeze drying foods, food preservation was important to early man. They developed convenient ways to preserve fresh foods so that in the lean months they would have a relative constant food supply. In the beginning, drying, smoking, salting, fermentation, cold and potting were used. In later years, preservation using sugar, <b>vinegar</b> and <b>alcohol</b> were employed as preservatives.

One route was {{the local}} manor lords and their wives, who disseminated the knowledge they had acquired both from the literature published in Germany {{as well as from}} personal experimentation. Another weighty source may have been the late 18 th-century almanacs that were published in the Estonian language and the popular medical literature, the publication of which escalated in the late 19 th century and which introduced recent news on medicine.

This paper discusses the advices on medicines and treatment published in medical texts in the almanacs of the period. Since drugs used for treatment were not medicines in the contemporary sense of the word, the term “medicament” should be defined more generally.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Nutritional {{management}} of blood glucose levels is a strategic {{target in the}} prevention and {{management of}} type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM), applicable across the population. To implement a successful strategy {{it is essential to}} understand the impact of dietary modulation on the postprandial rise in blood glucose concentrations. Methods: Using the highest quality data, a systematic and comprehensive literature review was undertaken. Included in this review were the major macronutrients (carbohydrate, pro-tein, fat), micronutrient vitamins and minerals, non-nutrient phytochemicals and additional foods such as low-calorie sweeteners, <b>vinegar</b> and <b>alcohol.</b> Results: The strongest corroboration of efficacy for improving glucose homeostasis was for insoluble and moderately fermentable cereal-based fiber and mono-unsaturated fatty acids as replacement of saturated fat. Postprandial glycaemia was decreased by intake of viscous soluble fiber and the predominant mechanism of action was considered to be by delaying absorption of co-ingested carbohydrates. There was weaker but substantial evidence that certain phytochemical-rich foods were likely to be effective. This may be associated with the su-ggestion that the gut microbiota {{plays an important role in}} me-tabolic regulation, which includes provision of phytochemical and other metabolites. Conclusions: Based on the evidence, it is clear that dietary components have significant and clinically relevant effects on blood glucose modulation. This suggests that employing a dietary regimen to attenuate the postprandial rise in blood glucose levels along with previously identified targets (reducing excess body weight and an increase in physical activity) will benefit the health of the population and limit the increasing worldwide incidence of T 2 D...|$|R

The issue is how to get the best out of mangroves without destroying them, and in the Philippines they seem to have found the solution in a simple measure called ANA'. Abbreviated from Agri-nipa-aquaculture, ANA is a technique which integrates three practices on one mangrove plot: sugar palm plantation (the palm is also known as Nipa - Nypa fruticans), market gardening and aquaculture. The nipa trees are planted in the centre of the plot. They stabilise the soil, their fibres and wood can be used in handicrafts, and sugar, <b>vinegar</b> and <b>alcohol</b> is made from their sap. Depending on the tides, the trees are partially submerged and provide a natural refuge for fish, as well as a place to raise tilapia and milkfish (Chanos chanos), which breed and grow there very quickly. Ditches are dug {{around the perimeter of the}} nipa plantation, and dikes are built up on the outside of the ditches. The dikes are then planted with market garden vegetables and fruits; those best suited for the saline conditions are tomatoes, aubergine, okra, maize, groundnuts, pineapples, passionfruit, bananas and jackfruit. Waste vegetation from the mangrove is used in a compost which is applied to the dikes. All in all, this is an efficient and well-integrated system but it cannot be used everywhere.
