5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} bark {{is known as}} the phloem and this is involved in the transport of the sap containing the sugars made by photosynthesis {{to other parts of the}} tree. It is a soft spongy layer of living cells, some of which are arranged end to end to form tubes. These are supported by parenchyma cells which provide padding and include fibres for strengthening the tissue. Inside the phloem is a layer of undifferentiated cells one cell thick called the <b>vascular</b> <b>cambium</b> layer. The cells are continually dividing, creating phloem cells on the outside and wood cells known as xylem on the inside.|$|E
25|$|In an adult, the phloem originates, {{and grows}} {{outwards}} from, meristematic {{cells in the}} <b>vascular</b> <b>cambium.</b> Phloem is produced in phases. Primary phloem is laid down by the apical meristem and develops from the procambium. Secondary phloem is laid down by the <b>vascular</b> <b>cambium</b> {{to the inside of}} the established layer(s) of phloem.|$|E
25|$|Woody dicots {{and many}} nonwoody dicots have {{secondary}} growth originating from their lateral or secondary meristems: the <b>vascular</b> <b>cambium</b> and the cork cambium or phellogen. The <b>vascular</b> <b>cambium</b> forms between the xylem and phloem in the vascular bundles and connects {{to form a}} continuous cylinder. The <b>vascular</b> <b>cambium</b> cells divide to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside. As the stem increases in diameter due to production of secondary xylem and secondary phloem, the cortex and epidermis are eventually destroyed. Before the cortex is destroyed, a cork cambium develops there. The cork cambium divides to produce waterproof cork cells externally and sometimes phelloderm cells internally. Those three tissues form the periderm, which replaces the epidermis in function. Areas of loosely packed cells in the periderm that function in gas exchange are called lenticels.|$|E
40|$|Chip budding {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{grafting}} methods used for the asexual propagation of woody plants used to produce named cultivars (varieties) or clones of many ornamental trees, shrubs, fruit and nut trees. It {{is one of the}} two most popular budding systems used in nursery production, and it is the only budding system that can be done on rootstocks (stocks) that have either active or dormant <b>vascular</b> <b>cambiums.</b> This NebGuide explains how to perform the technique and lists which plants can be successfully chip budded...|$|R
50|$|Oak wilt is a fungal {{caused by}} Ceratocystis fagacearum, {{is a disease}} {{originating}} in eastern Russia. It can slowly or quickly kill an oak tree when the tree reacts to the fungus by plugging its own cambial tissue while attempting to block {{the spread of the}} fungus. This plug prevents the <b>cambium</b> <b>vascular</b> tissue from delivering nutrients and water {{to the rest of the}} plant, which eventually kills it. Red oaks are very susceptible.|$|R
40|$|Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) catalyses {{the first}} {{specific}} {{step in the}} biosynthesis of monolignols, the monomeric units of lignins. We examined the developmental regulation of the Eucalyptus gunnii EgCCR promoter by analysing the expression of EgCCR-GUS fusions in tobacco. EgCCR promoter activity was strongest in lignified organs (stems and roots) consistent with the EgCCR mRNA level in these organs. Histochemical analysis showed expression in <b>vascular</b> tissues (<b>cambium,</b> young differentiating xylem, ray cells, internal and external phloem) of stems and roots in agreement with in situ hybridization data. Promoter deletion analysis and gain-of-function experiments identified the sequences between positions - 119 and - 77 as necessary and sufficient for expression in vascular tissues of stems. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays showed that this region is specifically recognized by nuclear proteins present in tobacco stems, giving rise to two retarded complexes, LMC 1 and LMC 2. Using overlapping EgCCR fragments and mutated oligonucleotides as competitors in gel-shift assays, two DNA-protein interaction sites were mapped. Finally, the role of protein-protein interactions {{in the formation of}} the LMC 1 and LMC 2 complexes was investigated using the detergent sodium deoxycholate, and protein fractionation onto a heparin Sepharose column...|$|R

25|$|In {{the tree}} a knot is either {{the base of}} a side branch or a dormant bud. A knot (when {{the base of a}} side branch) is conical in shape (hence the roughly {{circular}} cross-section) with the inner tip at the point in stem diameter at which the plant's <b>vascular</b> <b>cambium</b> was located when the branch formed as a bud.|$|E
25|$|Secondary growth {{encompasses}} all {{growth in}} diameter, {{a major component}} of woody plant tissues and many nonwoody plants. For example, storage roots of sweet potato have secondary growth but are not woody. Secondary growth occurs at the lateral meristems, namely the <b>vascular</b> <b>cambium</b> and cork cambium. The former forms secondary xylem and secondary phloem, while the latter forms the periderm.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Scopolia carniolica Jacq. is a {{medicinal}} {{species of}} Solanaceae, harvested from the Romanian spontaneous flora for its atropine and scopolamine content. We have analyzed the anatomical {{structure of the}} vegetative organs (rhizome, root, stem and leaf) and the biometrical parameters of the leaf blade (vascular islet, stomatal index and palisade ratio), {{in order to establish}} the main specific characters and differential elements useful for the correct identification and for avoiding the impurification of medicinal products. The characteristic structures for the rhizome and root are the secondary ones, mainly with parenchyma elements and lacking in mechanical fibres; the stem has a primary becoming secondary structure, bicolateral <b>vascular</b> bundles with <b>cambium</b> in the interior and between them and endoderma as starch layer. The sand cells are characteristic for rhizome, root and stem structures. On the leaf surface were identified protector multicellular trichomes and specific secretory and glandular ones...|$|R
40|$|Vascular tissues are {{important}} for transporting water and nutrients throughout the plant and as physical support of upright growth. The primary constituents of vascular tissues, xylem and phloem, are derived from the meristematic <b>vascular</b> procambium and <b>cambium.</b> Xylem cells develop secondary cell walls that form the largest part of plant lignocellulosic biomass that serve as a renewable feedstock for biofuel production. For the last decade, research on vascular development and secondary cell wall biosynthesis has seen rapid progress due {{to the importance of}} these processes to plant biology and to the biofuel industry. Plant hormones, transcriptional regulators and peptide signaling regulate procambium/cambium proliferation, vascular patterning, and xylem differentiation. Transcriptional regulatory pathways play a pivot role in secondary cell wall biosynthesis. Although most of these discoveries are derived from research in Arabidopsis, many genes have shown conserved functions in biofuel feedstock species. Here, we review the recent advances in our understanding of vascular development and secondary cell wall formation and discuss potential biotechnological uses...|$|R
40|$|A sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas cv. ‘Jinhongmi’) MADS-box protein cDNA (SRD 1) {{has been}} {{isolated}} {{from an early}} stage storage root cDNA library. The role of the SRD 1 gene {{in the formation of}} the storage root in sweetpotato was investigated by an expression pattern analysis and characterization of SRD 1 -overexpressing (ox) transgenic sweetpotato plants. Transcripts of SRD 1 were detected only in root tissues, with the fibrous root having low levels of the transcript and the young storage root showing relatively higher transcript levels. SRD 1 mRNA was mainly found in the actively dividing cells, including the <b>vascular</b> and <b>cambium</b> cells of the young storage root. The transcript level of SRD 1 in the fibrous roots increased in response to 1000 [*]μM indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) applied exogenously. During the early stage of storage root development, the endogenous IAA content and SRD 1 transcript level increased concomitantly, suggesting an involvement of SRD 1 during the early stage of the auxin-dependent development of the storage root. SRD 1 -ox sweetpotato plants cultured in vitro produced thicker and shorter fibrous roots than wild-type plants. The metaxylem and cambium cells of the fibrous roots of SRD 1 -ox plants showed markedly enhanced proliferation, resulting in the fibrous roots of these plants showing an earlier thickening growth than those of wild-type plants. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SRD 1 plays a role in the formation of storage roots by activating the proliferation of cambium and metaxylem cells to induce the initial thickening growth of storage roots in an auxin-dependent manner...|$|R
25|$|Wood, in {{the strict}} sense, is yielded by trees, which {{increase}} in diameter by the formation, between the existing wood {{and the inner}} bark, of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem, living branches, and roots. This process is known as secondary growth; it {{is the result of}} cell division in the <b>vascular</b> <b>cambium,</b> a lateral meristem, and subsequent expansion of the new cells. These cells then go on to form thickened secondary cell walls, composed mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.|$|E
25|$|Secondary xylem is commercially {{important}} as wood. The seasonal variation in growth from the <b>vascular</b> <b>cambium</b> is what creates yearly tree rings in temperate climates. Tree rings {{are the basis}} of dendrochronology, which dates wooden objects and associated artifacts. Dendroclimatology {{is the use of}} tree rings as a record of past climates. The aerial stem of an adult tree is called a trunk. The dead, usually darker inner wood of a large diameter trunk is termed the heartwood and is the result of tylosis. The outer, living wood is termed the sapwood.|$|E
500|$|Wood gives {{structural}} strength {{to the trunk}} of a tree; this supports the plant as it grows larger [...] The vascular system of trees allows water, nutrients and other chemicals to be distributed around the plant, and without it trees {{would not be able to}} grow as large as they do. Trees, as relatively tall plants, need to draw water up the stem through the xylem from the roots by the suction produced as water evaporates from the leaves. If insufficient water is available the leaves will die. The three main parts of trees include the root, stem, and leaves; they are integral parts of the vascular system which interconnects all the living cells. In trees and other plants that develop wood, the <b>vascular</b> <b>cambium</b> allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth. Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also have a cork cambium that develops among the phloem. The cork cambium gives rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss. Both the production of wood and the production of cork are forms of secondary growth.|$|E
40|$|In trees, xylem tissues play a {{key role}} in the {{formation}} of woody tissues, which have important uses for pulp and timber production; also DNA methylation plays an important part in gene regulation during xylogenesis in trees. In our study, methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) analysis was used to analyze the role cytosine methylation plays in wood formation in the commercially important tree species Populus tomentosa. This analysis compared the methylation patterns between xylem tissues (developing xylem and mature xylem) and non-xylem tissues (cambium, shoot apex, young leaf, mature leaf, phloem, root, male catkin, and female catkin) and found 10, 316 polymorphic methylation sites. MSAP identified 132 candidate genes with the same methylation patterns in xylem tissues, including seven wood-related genes. The expression of these genes differed significantly between xylem and non-xylem tissue types (P< 0. 01). This indicated that the difference of expression of specific genes with unique methylation patterns, rather than relative methylation levels between the two tissue types plays a critical role in wood biosynthesis. However, 46. 2 % of candidate genes with the same methylation pattern in <b>vascular</b> tissues (<b>cambium,</b> phloem, and developing xylem) did not have distinct expression patterns in xylem and non-xylem tissue. Also, bisulfite sequencing and transcriptome sequencing of MYB, NAC and FASCICLIN-LIKE AGP 13 revealed that the location of cytosine methylation in the gene might affect the expression of different transcripts from the corresponding gene. The expression of different transcripts that produce distinct proteins from a single gene might play an important role in the regulation of xylogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Eucalyptus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} sources of industrial cellulose. Three species of this botanical group are intensively used in breeding programs: E. globulus, E. grandis and E. urophylla. E. globulus is adapted to subtropical/temperate areas and is considered a source of high-quality cellulose; E. grandis grows rapidly and is adapted to tropical/subtropical climates; and E. urophylla, though less productive, is considered a source of genes related to robustness. Wood, or secondary xylem, results from <b>cambium</b> <b>vascular</b> differentiation and is mostly composed of cellulose, lignin and hemicelluloses. In this study, the xylem transcriptomes of the three Eucalyptus species were investigated in order to provide insights on the particularities presented by each of these species. Results: Data analysis showed that (1) most Eucalyptus genes are expressed in xylem; (2) most genes expressed in species-specific way constitutes genes with unknown functions and are interesting targets for future studies; (3) relevant differences were observed in the phenylpropanoid pathway: E. grandis xylem presents higher expression of genes involved in lignin formation whereas E. urophylla seems to deviates the pathway towards flavonoid formation; (4) stress-related genes are considerably more expressed in E. urophylla, suggesting that these genes may contribute to its robustness. Conclusions: The comparison of these three transcriptomes indicates the molecular signatures underlying some of their distinct wood characteristics. This information may contribute to the understanding of xylogenesis, thus increasing the potential of genetic engineering approaches aiming at the improvement of Eucalyptus forest plantations productivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effects of morphactin, on the growth and anatomical features of soybean plants (Glycine max L. Merrill) cv. Crawford. Field experiments were conducted under different irrigation regimes (every 5 and 10 days) on soybeans (Glycine max L. Merril) that were planted in a newly reclaimed sandy soil at the Experimental Farm at Suez Canal University, Egypt during seasons of 1998 and 1999. Different concentrations of the morphactin (0, 50 and 200 mg L - 1) were added at 40 days after sowing by foliar application. The morphactin treatments significantly decreased the plant height (14. 88 and 21. 44 % inhibition of stem elongation under the two irrigation regimes, respectively), while they increased the number of branches. The pod number plant - 1, seed number plant - 1, dry weight (g), nodule number plant - 1, reducing sugar content (mg g - 1 DW) and total phenols (mg g - 1 DW) increased significantly in response to morphactin treatment at 200 mg L - 1. Similarly, the thickness of the midrib, mesophyll, <b>vascular</b> bundle, xylem, <b>cambium</b> + phloem and xylem vessel in the main vascular bundle increased in response to treatment with morphactin at 200 mg L - 1. Low irrigation regime (every 10 days) had adverse effect on the growth and anatomical features of soybean. Overall, it is recommended that 200 mg L - 1 morphactin can be used for the stable production of soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) in newly reclaimed sandy soils in Egypt...|$|R
