50|$|A {{contactor}} is {{a heavy-duty}} relay with higher current ratings, used for switching electric motors and lighting loads. Continuous current ratings for common contactors range from 10 amps {{to several hundred}} amps. High-current contacts are made with alloys containing silver. The unavoidable arcing causes the contacts to oxidize; however, silver oxide is still a good conductor. Contactors with overload protection devices are often used to start motors. For medium-voltage motor control, vacuum interrupters are used in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>contactor.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} new {{application}} of permanent magnet actuator for vacuum contactors. A novel permanent magnet (PM) actuator {{to drive a}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>contactor</b> with intrinsically safe and low supply voltage is proposed. PM is mounted on the static iron of the contactor to enhance its holding force and reliability. While only one coil is used to break the <b>vacuum</b> <b>contactor,</b> two series coils are deployed to yield a high magnetomotive force to realize the making operation. The electrical circuit equation, mechanical equation and magnetic field are all coupled in the simulation. A prototype is manufactured and tested to validate and showcase {{the performance of the}} contactor which is equipped with the proposed PM actuator. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} the development, up to prototype stage, of an electromechanical actuation {{system for a}} medium-voltage <b>vacuum</b> <b>contactor.</b> Such development is carried out using a multi-domain simulation-based mechatronic approach, i. e. developing coordinated sub-models for the mechanism linking the actuator to the movable parts of the interrupter, the rotational electromagnetic actuator, and the power and control electronic circuit supplying the actuator and governing the system via a digital control unit. After a preliminary analysis, the modeling, design and check of the parts via coordinated simulations is presented. A prototype of the system, manufactured to validate the design procedure is finally presented...|$|E
50|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>contactors</b> utilize <b>vacuum</b> bottle {{encapsulated}} contacts {{to suppress}} the arc. This arc suppression allows the contacts to be much smaller and use less space than air break contacts at higher currents. As the contacts are encapsulated, <b>vacuum</b> <b>contactors</b> are used fairly extensively in dirty applications, such as mining.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>contactors</b> {{are only}} {{applicable}} {{for use in}} AC systems. The AC arc generated upon {{opening of the contacts}} will self-extinguish at the zero-crossing of the current waveform, with the vacuum preventing a re-strike of the arc across the open contacts. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>contactors</b> are therefore very efficient at disrupting the energy of an electric arc and are used when relatively fast switching is required, as the maximum break time is determined by the periodicity of the AC waveform. In the case of 60HZ power (United States standard), the power will discontinue within 1/120 or 0.008333 of a second.|$|R
50|$|Motor control {{centers are}} usually used for low voltage {{three-phase}} alternating current motors from 208 V to 600 V. Medium-voltage {{motor control centers}} are made for large motors running at 2300 V to around 15000 V, using <b>vacuum</b> <b>contactors</b> for switching and with separate compartments for power switching and control.|$|R
40|$|In {{commercial}} medium-voltage <b>vacuum</b> <b>contactors,</b> {{widely used}} for grid management, the linear motion {{required for the}} actuation of contacts is often generated by a linear actuator. Aiming to investigate alternatives from an industrial point of view, a rotary actuation system based on a switched reluctance motor and a suited coupling mechanism was developed. The design process, based on a mechatronic approach using multi-physics modeling and simulation, is recalled first in this paper. A dedicated test rig designed and assembled for validation purposes is then described. Finally, experimental results obtained by testing the prototype motor and coupling mechanism are presented, confirming the expected performances...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{motor control}} {{contactors}} at low voltages (600 volts and less) are air break contactors; air at atmospheric pressure surrounds the contacts and extinguishes the arc when interrupting the circuit. Modern medium-voltage AC motor controllers use <b>vacuum</b> <b>contactors.</b> High voltage AC contactors (greater than 1,000 volts) may use vacuum or an inert gas around the contacts. High voltage DC contactors (greater than 600V) still rely on air within specially designed arc-chutes {{to break the}} arc energy. High-voltage electric locomotives may be isolated from their overhead supply by roof-mounted circuit breakers actuated by compressed air; the same air supply {{may be used to}} [...] "blow out" [...] any arc that forms.|$|R
