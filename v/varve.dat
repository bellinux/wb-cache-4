25|$|<b>Varve</b> (or varved clay) is clay with visible annual layers, {{which are}} formed by {{seasonal}} deposition of those layers and {{are marked by}} differences in erosion and organic content. This type of deposit is common in former glacial lakes. When fine sediments are delivered into the calm waters of these glacial lake basins away from the shoreline, they settle to the lake bed. The resulting seasonal layering is preserved in an even distribution of clay sediment banding.|$|E

500|$|The Pleistocene is a {{geological}} epoch {{that began}} about 2.6 million years ago. [...] The Holocene, the current geological epoch, begins about 11,700 years ago, when the Pleistocene ends. [...] Establishing {{the date of}} this boundary − which is defined by sharp climatic warming − as accurately as possible has been a goal of geologists {{for much of the}} 20th century. [...] At Two Creeks, in Wisconsin, a fossil forest was discovered (Two Creeks Buried Forest State Natural Area), and subsequent research determined that the destruction of the forest was caused by the Valders ice readvance, the last southward movement of ice {{before the end of the}} Pleistocene in that area. [...] Before the advent of radiocarbon dating, the fossilized trees had been dated by correlating sequences of annually deposited layers of sediment at Two Creeks with sequences in Scandinavia. This led to estimates that the trees were between 24,000 and 19,000 years old, and hence this was taken to be the date of the last advance of the Wisconsin glaciation before its final retreat marked the end of the Pleistocene in North America. [...] In 1952 Libby published radiocarbon dates for several samples from the Two Creeks site and two similar sites nearby; the dates were averaged to 11,404 BP with a standard error of 350 years. [...] This result was uncalibrated, as the need for calibration of radiocarbon ages was not yet understood. [...] Further results over the next decade supported an average date of 11,350 BP, with the results thought to be most accurate averaging 11,600 BP. [...] There was initial resistance to these results on the part of Ernst Antevs, the palaeobotanist who had worked on the Scandinavian <b>varve</b> series, but his objections were eventually discounted by other geologists. [...] In the 1990s samples were tested with AMS, yielding (uncalibrated) dates ranging from 11,640 BP to 11,800 BP, both with a standard error of 160 years. [...] Subsequently, a sample from the fossil forest was used in an interlaboratory test, with results provided by over 70 laboratories. [...] These tests produced a median age of 11,788 ± 8 BP (2σ confidence) which when calibrated gives a date range of 13,730 to 13,550 cal BP. [...] The Two Creeks radiocarbon dates are now regarded as a key result in developing the modern understanding of North American glaciation at the end of the Pleistocene.|$|E
2500|$|The Llanquihue {{glaciation}} {{takes its}} name from Llanquihue Lake in southern Chile which is a fan-shaped piedmont glacial lake. On the lake's western shores there are large moraine systems of which the innermost belong to the last glacial period. Llanquihue Lake's varves are a node point in southern Chile's <b>varve</b> geochronology. During the last glacial maximum the Patagonian Ice Sheet extended over the Andes from about 35°S to Tierra del Fuego at 55°S. The western part appears to have been very active, with wet basal conditions, while the eastern part was cold based. Cryogenic features like ice wedges, patterned ground, pingos, rock glaciers, palsas, soil cryoturbation, [...] solifluction deposits developed in unglaciated extra-Andean Patagonia during the Last Glaciation. However, not all these reported features have been verified. The area west of Llanquihue Lake was ice-free during the LGM, and had sparsely distributed vegetation dominated by Nothofagus. Valdivian temperate rainforest was reduced to scattered remnants in the western side of the Andes.|$|E
50|$|In 1924, the Geochronological Institute, {{a special}} {{laboratory}} dedicated to <b>varve</b> research was established. De Geer {{and his co-workers}} and students made trips to other countries and continents to investigate varved sediments. Ernst Antevs studied sites from Long Island, U.S.A. to Lake Timiskaming and Hudson Bay, Canada, and created a North American <b>varve</b> chronology. Carl Caldenius visited Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, and Erik Norin visited central Asia. By this stage, other geologists were investigating <b>varve</b> sequences, including Matti Sauramo who constructed a <b>varve</b> chronology of the last deglaciation in Finland.|$|E
50|$|Laminations {{formed in}} glaciolacustrine environments (in glacier lakes) are a special case. They are called <b>varves.</b> Quaternary <b>varves</b> {{are used in}} {{stratigraphy}} and palaeoclimatology to reconstruct climate changes {{during the last few}} hundred thousand years.|$|R
50|$|Annually {{laminated}} deposits or <b>varves</b> are rhythmites {{with annual}} periodicity: annual layers of sediment or sedimentary rock are laid down through seasonal variations {{that result from}} precipitation, or from temperature, which influences precipitation rates and debris loads in runoff.

40|$|A {{functional}} {{data analysis}} (FDA) approach to analyse historical archives such as annually laminated (<b>varved)</b> lake sediments is suggested, {{with the aim}} of reconstructing past environment and climate changes. <b>Varved</b> lake sediment has inherent (within-year) seasonal patterns that are expected to contain valuable information about past (seasonal) climate, with similar profiles corresponding to similar climatic conditions. Image analysis is used to generate the observed data of yearly seasonal profiles in terms of a sequence of grey-scale pixel variation. FDA methods are used to cluster the seasonal patterns of the <b>varves</b> (years) into a set of k homogeneous groups. We propose and compare a non-parametric and a model-based FDA method, illustrated on a <b>varved</b> lake sediment core from the lake KassjÃ¶n (N. Sweden) covering the past > 6400 years. The possibilities to improve the clustering of the <b>varves</b> by incorporating covariates, time warping and time dependence between years will also be discussed...|$|R

50|$|In 1915 De Geer matched, or 'teleconnected', <b>varve</b> curves from Sweden to <b>varve</b> curves from Finland and Norway. This {{first attempt}} at long {{distance}} correlation marked the start of two decades travelling around the world by De Geer and his colleagues, searching out <b>varve</b> sequences for potential teleconnections. In 1920, De Geer travelled to North America {{with his wife and}} two assistants, Ernst Antevs, and Ragnar Liden. Antevs remained in North America at the end of the trip, where he worked on the North American <b>varve</b> chronology. Further trips included Erik Norin's visit to the Himalayas (1924-1925), Erik Nilsson's visit to East Africa (1927-28), and Carl Caldenius' visit to South America (1925-1929), and later New Zealand (1932-34).|$|E
50|$|The first <b>varve</b> {{chronology}} {{was constructed}} by De Geer in Stockholm {{in the late}} 19th century. Further work soon followed, and a network of sites along {{the east coast of}} Sweden was established. The varved sediments exposed in these sites had formed in glaciolacustrine and glacimarine conditions in the Baltic basin as the last ice sheet retreated northwards. By 1914, De Geer had discovered {{that it was possible to}} compare <b>varve</b> sequences across long distances by matching variations in <b>varve</b> thickness, and distinct marker laminae. However, this discovery led De Geer and many of his co-workers into making incorrect correlations, which they called 'teleconnections', between continents, a process criticised by other <b>varve</b> pioneers like Ernst Antevs.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the strictly limnological research on the lakes, the sediments at their bottoms {{are being used to}} explore the history of the plant and animal life and of the climate around the lake over the last several thousand years (i.e. its paleoclimatology). Because the deep, oxygen-depleted bottoms of the lakes are undisturbed either by annual mixing or by [...] "bioturbation" [...] (plant growth or movement of worms and other animals), each year's sediments are preserved as distinguishable layers (or <b>varves)</b> that can be dated back in time from the present. There is a distinct change in the color of the <b>varves</b> that occurred around 1800; the lower, older <b>varves</b> are dark brown, and the higher, younger <b>varves</b> are grey. The <b>varves</b> thus record the change in the lakes' environment around 1800, when the primeval forests in the region were replaced by open fields and farmland. The Round Lake National Natural Landmark offers a glimpse of the original forest.|$|R
50|$|Lower Mystic Lake is a {{meromictic}} lake, {{which means}} that the lake has a deep layer of water that rarely, if ever, mixes with its top waters. As a consequence, the sediments at the bottom of Lower Mystic Lake accumulate in annual layers (or <b>varves)</b> that have been nearly undisturbed for a thousand years. Such <b>varves</b> in meromictic lakes preserve an historical record somewhat like tree rings do. In the case of Lower Mystic Lake, the <b>varves</b> have been used by Mark Besonen and his collaborators to study the historical incidence of hurricanes.|$|R
50|$|Flood beds on the Sanpoil arm of glacial Lake Columbia show episodic flood {{deposits}} {{as well as}} deposit grading and rhythmical repetition.

5000|$|De Geer firmly {{believed}} the main control on <b>varve</b> sedimentation was solar radiation acting on glacier meltwater production, and that consequently, varved sediments represented a [...] "..gigantic, natural self-registering thermograph" [...] (De Geer 1926) and <b>varve</b> curves (<b>varve</b> thickness plotted against <b>varve</b> number or year), which he {{often referred to}} as 'solar curves', a reliable proxy for past changes in solar radiation. Ultimately, De Geer hoped his studies of varves would explain the fundamental cause of Ice Ages - [...] "If the last glaciation everywhere should show to be synchronous and the origin of the last Ice Age thus to be of a general nature, the assumption of a cosmic cause would scarcely be avoidable." ...|$|E

40|$|Groundwater {{dynamics}} {{may play}} a significant role in landslides. A detailed model is developed of the groundwater dynamics in landslides in <b>varved</b> clays in the Trièves area in the French Alps. The <b>varved</b> clays consist of a sequence of alternating silt and clay layers, covered by a colluvium layer and cut through by fissures. The hydraulic conductivity of the clay layers is negligible compared to the silt layers. It is conceptualized that fissures form a hydraulic connection between the colluvium and the <b>varved</b> clays. Groundwater recharge flows through the colluvium into the fissures where water is exchanged horizontally between the fissure and the silt layers of the <b>varved</b> clays. Groundwater flow in the colluvium is simulated with the Boussinesq equation while flow in the silt layers of the <b>varved</b> clays is simulated with the Richards' equation. Longitudinal outflow from the fissure is simulated with a linear-reservoir model. Scattered data of relatively short monitoring periods is available for several landslides in the region. A good similarity between observed and simulated heads is obtained, especially when considering the lack of important physical parameters such as the fissure width and the distance between the monitoring point and the fissure. A simulation for the period 1959 – 2004 showed some correlation between peaks in the simulated heads and the recorded occurrence of landslides while the bottom of the <b>varved</b> clays remained saturated during the entire simulation period.
