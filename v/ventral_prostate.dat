Results of histological examination indicated that the prostates from control animals showed normal morphology, whereas those from the denervated animals showed reduced cell height and enlarged vacuoles surrounding the nuclei. Inspection of electron micrographs revealed that the prostates from denervated animals, compared with those of controls, showed a reduced ratio of cell height: cell width, which is associated with a reduced number of microviffi and secretory granules.

Twenty-four hours later, the unattached epithelial cells were replated in WAJC- 404 medium supplemented with insulin (5 ig/ml), transferrin (5 g/ml), and selenious acid (5 ng/ml). Bovine pituitary extract (BPE) (30 ig/ml), EGF (10 ng/ml), and TGF-$ 1 (0, 0. 1, and 1. 0 ng/ml) were added either alone or in combination according to experimental requirements.

Stereology of prostatic components showed significant alterations of tissue compartments in the <b>ventral</b> male <b>prostate</b> after castration, especially after 21 days, with a significant increase in stroma. Administration of testosterone led to disorganization in the female prostate, with a significant increase in collagen fibers and smooth muscle cells after 21 days, along with the development of epithelial lesions such as PINs. MMP- 2 increased after 21 days of castration in males; however, the TIMP- 2 immunoreaction for this group was weak or absent. In females, the expression of MMP- 2 appeared to decrease after 7 days of treatment with testosterone, but after 21 days, both epithelium and stroma showed a stronger reaction for MMP- 2 than the controls. The expression of TIMP- 2 in the treated females was similar to its expression in the castrated males. We conclude that the distribution of MMPs and TIMPs in both male and female prostates is altered by androgen manipulation, but the mechanism of stromal regulation appears to be distinct between genders because both the lack of T in castrated males and the excess levels of T in treated females lead to the same effect...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To isolate new cDNAs {{corresponding}} to genes whose expression is increased during castration-induced rat prostate apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Differential display of mRNAs from 3 -day castrated and normal rat <b>ventral</b> <b>prostates</b> {{was used to}} identify differentially expressed clones. Northern blots were hybridized to confirm the positive regulation of the candidates and to follow the change in their expression in the involuting rat prostate, and in thymocytes of dexamethazone-treated rats. RESULTS: Five cDNAs were cloned: one encoding ribosomal protein L 7, one coding for the insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 3 (IGFBP- 3), and three whose products are unknown. After castration, all five genes had expression kinetics that closely paralleled the proportion of prostatic epithelial cells undergoing apoptosis.

40|$|AbstractVentral {{prostate}} development occurs by branching morphogenesis {{and is an}} androgen-dependent process modulated by {{growth factors}}. Many growth factors have been implicated in branching morphogenesis including activins (dimers of βA and βB subunits); activin A inhibited branching of lung and kidney in vitro. Our aim {{was to examine the}} role of activins on prostatic development in vitro and their localization in vivo. Organ culture of day 0 rat <b>ventral</b> <b>prostates</b> for 6 days with activin A (+/− testosterone) inhibited prostatic branching and growth without increasing apoptosis. The activin-binding protein follistatin increased branching in vitro in the absence (but not presence) of testosterone, suggesting endogenous activins may reduce prostatic branching morphogenesis. In vivo, inhibin α subunit was not expressed until puberty, therefore inhibins (dimers of α and β subunits) are not involved in prostatic development. Activin βA was immunolocalized to developing prostatic epithelium and mesenchymal aggregates at ductal tips. Activin βB immunoreactivity was weak during development, but was upregulated in prostatic epithelium during puberty. Activin receptors were expressed throughout the prostatic epithelium. Follistatin mRNA and protein were expressed throughout the prostatic epithelium. The in vitro evidence that activin and follistatin have opposing effects on ductal branching suggests a role for activin as a negative regulator of prostatic ductal branching morphogenesis...|$|R

There was no detectable difference between WT and LXRα−/− mice VP in the expression of the androgen receptor, but there was an increase in nuclear expression of Snail and Smad 2 / 3, indicating enhanced TGF-β signaling. Upon treatment of WT mice for 3 months with the LXR agonist T 2320 or for 3 weeks with β-sitosterol, LXRα was downregulated, and a VP phenotype similar to that of LXRα−/− mice resulted. We conclude that in rodents, LXRα seems to control VP stromal growth and that LXRα−/− mice may be a useful model to study prostatic stromal hyperplasia. Because LXRα is expressed in the epithelium, the excessive stromal growth in LXRα−/− mice indicates that LXRα is essential for epithelial stromal communication...|$|R

Isotope-exchange measurements of nuclear androgen receptors by using [3 H]methyltrienolone indicated that, although the concentration of nuclear dihydrotestosterone was several-fold higher than the concentration of androgen receptors, they were logarithmically related. The recruitment of prostatic cells into the growth fraction and the stimulation of 5 alpha-reductase activity were more directly correlated to the nuclear concentration of androgen receptors than to the total nuclear concentration of dihydrotestosterone. Maximal restoration of a specific isoenzyme of acid phosphatase ws achieved when approx. 2000 androgen receptors {{were present in the}} prostatic nuclei; higher concentrations of nuclear androgen receptors were associated with decreased amounts of this enzyme. Hence the results imply, first, that the total amount of dihydrotestosterone accumulated by nuclei is not a direct consequence of carrier-mediated transport by androgen receptors, and, secondly, that, whereas acid phosphatase may be differentially controlled by androgens in the regenerating prostate, increases in the amount of cell proliferation and 5 alpha-reductase activity directly parallel increases in the nuclear concentration of androgen receptors...|$|R

In addition, these groups showed important inflammatory processes but not prostate lesions. The proliferation/death rates of prostatic cells obtained by PCNA and TUNEL immunostaining demonstrated increased cell death in the 52 d groups; in contrast, the gland acquired a more proliferative nature in the 120 d groups. AR immunostaining showed that BPA and Cd compounds interact with ARs in different ways depending on the evaluated period and the hormonal profile of the animal.

Ornithine decarboxylase activity and the concentrations of putrescine, spermidine and spermine were measured. DNA-synthetic activity was monitored by measuring [125 I]iododoxyuridine incorporation. An enhanced spermidine/spermine molar ratio reflected increased activity of the prostate. The ratio was higher (greater than 2) in prostates from sexually immature animals, than in the intact adult (1. 5), suggesting that the ratio was indicative of the proliferative activity of the tissue. However, in the androgen-stimulated castrated rat, enhanced spermidine/spermine ratios tended to correlate with hypertrophy and secretion. In both sets of experiments there was a linear {{relationship between}} protein and spermidine content. High spermidine/spermine molar ratios were the consequence of a relatively low rate of accumulation of spermine relative to spermidine and protein.

40|$|Background: Cyclosporin A (CsA) is an {{immunosuppressive}} drug {{widely used in}} treatment of auto-immune diseases or after organ transplants. However, several side effects are commonly associated with CsA long term intake, some regarding to loss of reproductive organ function due to oxidative damage. Considering that phytotherapy is an important tool often used against oxidative stress, {{we would like to}} describe the beneficial effects of Heteropterys tomentosa intake to minimize the damage caused by CsA to the <b>ventral</b> <b>prostate</b> tissue of Wistar rats under laboratorial conditions. Methods: Thirty adult Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus albinus) were divided into: control group (water); CsA group (Cyclosporin A); Ht group (H. tomentosa infusion) and CsA + Ht group (CsA and H. tomentosa infusion). Plasmic levels of hepatotoxicity markers, triglycerides, cholesterol and glucose were quantified. The <b>ventral</b> <b>prostate</b> tissue was analyzed under light microscopy, using stereological, morphometrical and immunohistochemical techniques. Results: H. tomentosa did not cause any alterations either of the plasmic parameters or of the <b>ventral</b> <b>prostate</b> structure. CsA caused alterations of GOT, total and indirect bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels in the plasma; CsA-treated rats showed alterations of the <b>ventral</b> <b>prostate</b> tissue. There were no alterations regarding the plasma levels of GOT, triglycerides and glucose of CsA + Ht animals. The same group also showed normalization of most of the parameters analyzed on the <b>ventral</b> <b>prostate</b> tissue when compared to the CsA group. The treatments did not alter the pattern of AR expression or the apoptotic index of the <b>ventral</b> <b>prostate</b> epithelium. Conclusions: The results suggest a protective action of the H. tomentosa infusion against the side effects of CsA on the <b>ventral</b> <b>prostate</b> tissue, which could also be observed with plasmic biochemical parameters. © 2013 Freitas et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E

The results and conclusions are as follows: 1. 3 H-radioactivity was accumulated selectively in the <b>ventral</b> <b>prostate</b> of the castrated male rat after the administration of 3 H-estramustine. Estramustine and its metabolites were retained in the <b>ventral</b> <b>prostate</b> for longer time, comparing with estradiol- 17 β or cyproterone acetate. The ammount　of radioactivity in purified nucleus of the <b>ventral</b> <b>prostate</b> was only 0. 39 % {{of that in the}} cytosol at 24 hours after the injection of 3 H-estramustine. These results strongly suggested that there existed the mechanism of retention of est ramus tine and its metabolites in the cytosol of rat <b>ventral</b> <b>prostate.</b> 2. The sucrose density gradient analysis demonstrated that the <b>ventral</b> <b>prostate</b> cytosol binding proteins, which bind estramustine and/or its metabolites, have sedimentation coefficient of 3 to 5 S and the pretreatment with injer: 1 -ion of estradiol- 17 βreducecd this 3 - 5 S radioactive peak. Thin layer chromatographic analysis showed that 3 H-compounds which bind 3 - 5 S macromolecules were mainly estramustine and estrone-cytostatic complex (Leo 271 f) and that smaller amounts of estradiol- 17 β and estrone were detected. It is sure from these resuits that there exist in the cytosol of rat <b>ventral</b> <b>prostate</b> a macromolecule which bind hormone-cytostatic complexes and is different from androgen receptor...|$|E
40|$|Plasminogen {{activator}} {{was measured}} in the <b>ventral</b> <b>prostates</b> of non-castrated, castrated, and androgen-treated rats to determine whether changes in this activity correlated {{with the process of}} glandular involution. While the activity was very low in cytosolic extracts from the prostates of non-castrated rats, 2 days following castration the plasminogen activator activity increased in a near-linear fashion such that by day 7 it was 10 -fold higher in terms of specific activity (per mg of protein) and cellular concentration (per mg of DNA). During this interval there was a rapid decrease in the cell population of the prostates. Treatment of the 7 -day castrated rats with the potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone, both reduced the plasminogen activator activity and restored the cell number in a dose-related manner. Gel electrophoretic analysis revealed two major bands of plasminogen activator activity in the cytosolic extracts from 4 - and 7 -day castrated rats, plus additional minor bands in samples from 10 - and 14 -day castrated rats. Approx. 10 % of the cellular concentration of plasminogen activator activity was recovered in association with an 18000 g pellet fraction from the prostates; this fraction showed less heterogeneity of the plasminogen activator forms as observed by gel electrophoresis. Inhibitor studies indicated that the 18000 g pellet fraction from the prostates of non-castrated rats possessed some plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, but the relative concentration of the inhibitor activity was small. We conclude that the involution of the prostate is probably associated with increased synthesis of plasminogen activators through a de-repression process which may involve loss of androgen receptors...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported epithelial cellular hyperplasia in <b>ventral</b> <b>prostates</b> (VP) of mice lacking estrogen receptor β (ERβ). To investigate {{the causes of}} this phenomenon, we measured cellular proliferation and apoptosis in VP of ERβ-/- and WT mice. With BrdUrd labeling, the number of proliferating cells was 3. 6 -fold higher in ERβ-/- mice. There was also a decrease in apoptosis as measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay {{and an increase in}} expression of the anti-apoptotic bcl- 2. The state of differentiation of the epithelial cells of the VP was studied by immunohistochemical staining, Western blotting, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). In ERβ-/- mouse VP, the number of p 63 -positive cells (basal phenotype) was 2. 6 -fold higher, and expression level of cytokeratin (CK) 8, a luminal cell marker, was lower. FACS analysis with p 63 showed that in WT mice the ratio of basal to intermediate/luminal cell populations expressing p 63 was 1 : 2. 5, whereas in ERβ-/- mice it was 1 : 9. The expression of basal/intermediate marker CK 19 in three FACS areas, g 1, g 2, and g 3, gated according to cellular size and granularity, was 1 : 0. 6 : 2 in WT and 1 : 4 : 6. 7 in ERβ-/- mice, showing a shift of CK 19 -positive cells toward a cell population of intermediate size and granularity. We conclude that, in ERβ-/- mouse VP, there is increased epithelial proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and accumulation of incompletely differentiated cells in an intermediate pool. The continued proliferation of intermediate cells leads to the prostatic epithelial hyperplasia observed in the absence of ERβ signaling...|$|R
