25|$|Ristovski also {{intended}} {{the film to}} portray social conditions in post-independence Macedonia, depicting it as a society plagued by anomie, violence and corruption. He saw these conditions {{as part of a}} larger regional unease whose history included civil conflict in former Yugoslav territories. Critics have similarly interpreted the film as an allegory of these social and regional concerns. In this context, Marko's transition from <b>victimhood</b> to criminality embodies the cycle of violence endemic in such conditions, while his failed hopes serve as a cautionary warning against the dangers of empty idealism in such situations. One critic saw Paris' bullet in Marko's chess set (see figure on the right) as a metaphor for the threat of violence ever-present in their world.|$|E

500|$|Dalrymple {{analyses}} {{the poet}} Sylvia Plath, whom {{he describes as}} the [...] "patron saint of self-dramatization", and interprets Margaret Drabble's descriptions of Plath as a [...] "willing casualty" [...] and [...] "supremely vulnerable" [...] to mean [...] "virtues of a high order". He then examines how Plath blamed her father for her suffering, and identifies him in her poem [...] "Daddy" [...] with Nazism and makes allusions to the holocaust. Dalrymple writes that [...] "Plath felt it right to allude {{to one of the}} worst and most deliberate inflictions of mass-suffering in the whole of human history, merely on the basis that her father, who died when she was young, was German…the metaphorical use of the holocaust measures not the scale of her suffering, but of her self-pity". He asserts that before Plath, self-pity [...] "was regarded as a vice, even a disgusting one, that precluded sympathy", and that [...] "the appropriation of the suffering of others to boost the scale and significance of one's own suffering is now a commonplace." [...] He then analyses a number of figures, including Binjamin Wilkomirski and Margaret Seltzer, who he alleges [...] "make bogus claims to victim status" [...] and whose stories reveal perfectly [...] "the dialectic between sentimentality and brutality". Dalrymple ends the chapter by analysing <b>victimhood</b> {{in the criminal justice system}} and concludes, [...] "For the sentimentalist, of course, there is no such thing as a criminal, only an environment that has let him down".|$|E
500|$|Awarding the {{character}} of Ianto the status of [...] "Cult Spy Icon", British entertainment news website Digital Spy describes him as a [...] "cult legend", citing his dour demeanour, one-liners and [...] "eye candy" [...] label. Gay men's website AfterElton placed Ianto as their seventh best gay and bisexual character in modern science fiction (encompassing television, film and comic books), with Torchwoods Jack, Ianto's love interest, receiving first place. Wired magazine {{was impressed with the}} way Ianto's romantic storyline was handled in the third series, and praised Davies's writing for the [...] "deft, sympathetic handling" [...] of the Harkness-Jones romance, compared with the [...] "clumsiness" [...] of the show's homoerotic overtones in previous series. Because Ianto's storyline grows out of the reality of the show, [...] "it plays with such genuine sympathy and pathos that Jones's eventual fate is easily the miniseries' most powerful moment." [...] Wired describes David-Lloyd's performance as Jones as [...] "a key element in the success of the five-episode story arc." [...] One AfterElton contributor disliked the death scene partially for the loss of a [...] "beloved gay character", and because Ianto's death was caused by Jack's stupidity, goading on the aliens. They compared the death scene to that of Tara (Amber Benson) in Joss Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer which he felt was more satisfying, although [...] "unbearably sad" [...] because of its pivotal role in {{the character}} arc for Willow (Alyson Hannigan), and as being [...] "possibly the single most significant event in the whole seven-season series." [...] He feels that both Joss Whedon and Russell T Davies toyed with their LGBT fans' affections, and claim [...] "neither Whedon nor Davies seem aware of the impact that these characters were having on viewers starved for such representations." [...] Later, AfterElton published an opposing view, which analysed the character's death in view of the character's earlier refusal to admit to his relationship with a man, and claimed that, instead of being an expression of homophobia, the death was a sign that the LGBT community was leaving behind its image of <b>victimhood.</b> In 2012 David Brown of the Radio Times described Ianto's demise as one of televisions five most shocking death scenes and [...] "surely [...] finest hour".|$|E

2500|$|Robert Paxton {{says that}} fascism is [...] "a form of {{political}} behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or <b>victimhood</b> and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion".|$|E
2500|$|Before {{and after}} her death, Diana has been {{depicted}} in contemporary art. The first biopics about Diana and Charles were Charles and Diana: A Royal Love Story and The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana that were broadcast on American TV channels on 17 and 20 September 1981, respectively. In December 1992, ABC aired Charles and Diana: Unhappily Ever After, a TV movie about marital discord between Diana and Charles. In the 1990s, British magazine Private Eye called her [...] "Cheryl" [...] and Prince Charles [...] "Brian". Some of the artworks {{after her death}} have referenced the conspiracy theories, as well as paying tribute to Diana's compassion and acknowledging her perceived <b>victimhood.</b>|$|E
2500|$|India House and its {{activities}} had some {{influence on the}} subsequent nonviolent philosophy adopted by Gandhi. He had met some members of India House, including Savarkar, in London {{as well as in}} India, and disagreed with the adoption of nationalist and political philosophies from the west. Gandhi dismissively labelled this revolutionary violence as anarchist and its practitioners as [...] "The Modernists". Some of his subsequent writings, including Hind Swaraj, were opposed to the activities of Savarkar and Dhingra, and disputed the argument that violence was innocent if perpetrated under a nationalist identity or while under Colonial <b>victimhood.</b> It was against this strategy of revolutionary violence– and in recognition of its consequences– that the formative background of Gandhian nonviolence was framed.|$|E
2500|$|Support for {{the idea}} that Arafat planned the Intifadah comes from Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar, who said in September 2010 that when Arafat {{realized}} that the Camp David Summit in July 2000 would not result in the meeting of all of his demands, he ordered Hamas as well as Fatah and the Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, to launch [...] "military operations" [...] against Israel. al-Zahar is corroborated by Mosab Hassan Yousef, son of the Hamas founder and leader, Sheikh Hassan Yousef, who claims that the Second Intifada was a political maneuver premeditated by Arafat. Yousef claims that [...] "Arafat had grown extraordinarily wealthy as the international symbol of <b>victimhood.</b> He wasn't about to surrender that status and take on the responsibility of actually building a functioning society." ...|$|E
2500|$|A plot {{point in}} Children of Earth {{triggered}} protests from {{fans of the}} show, among them the [...] "Save Ianto Jones" [...] campaign, which collected more than £10,000 for the British Children in Need annual charity event. Other fans resorted to abuse and threats, causing writer James Moran to fire off an angry missive in a blog post. Showrunner Russell T Davies made no apologies for the decision to kill off the character, saying, [...] "I'm just delighted that the fans are so wrapped in the character to have that reaction." [...] The plot point attracted more controversy from some commentators, additionally, because it depicted {{the death of a}} main character involved in a same-sex relationship. This led several writers to analyse the death in view of the character's earlier refusal to admit to his relationship with a man, and claimed that the death was a sign that the LGBT community was leaving behind its image of <b>victimhood.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Donald Richie {{has written}} that Fires on the Plain is in {{contrast}} to Ichikawa's earlier The Burmese Harp as it [...] "could be considered conciliatory" [...] whereas Fires on the Plain is [...] "deliberately confrontational". Alexander Jacoby has written: [...] "The Burmese Harp and Fires on the Plain differ in approach – the one sentimental, the other visceral, rather in the manner of the American Vietnam movie of later years. The comparison is telling: just as Hollywood has largely failed to deal with the politics of US involvement in Vietnam, preferring to focus on the individual sufferings on American soldiers, so Ichikawa's war films make only a token acknowledgement of wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, and largely buy into assumptions of Japanese <b>victimhood</b> in World War II – assumptions which to this day remain too widespread in the country." [...] He has further written that, like Tamura, many of Ichikawa's characters are loners.|$|E
2500|$|Historians such as Niall Ferguson have {{assessed}} a {{key factor}} behind the high-level decision to use mass rape for ethnic cleansing as being misguided nationalism. Since its inception, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia {{had not been a}} platform for internal nationalist sentiment, and individuals who sought to ignite tensions risked imprisonment, torture or execution. In 1989 Serbian president, Slobodan Milošević inflamed Serbian nationalist sentiment with the Gazimestan Speech which referred to the Battle of Kosovo. Feelings of <b>victimhood</b> and aggression towards Bosniaks were further stirred up with exaggerated tales about the role played by a small number of Bosniaks in the persecution of Serbs during the Ustaše genocide in the 1940s. Serb propaganda suggested that Bosniaks were largely descended from Turks.. Despite the Serbian government-led hate campaigns, some Serbs tried to defend Bosniaks from the atrocities and had to be threatened, including instances when troops would announce by loudspeaker that [...] "every Serb who protects a Muslim will be killed immediately".|$|E
2500|$|Martina Thiele {{remarked that}} [...] "Naked Among Wolves {{is not a}} {{holocaust}} film in the strict sense, but rather a 'testimony of anti-Fascism'." [...] The picture emphasized the international solidarity of the communists, and the racial classifications in the concentration camp were largely overlooked. Daniela Berghahn wrote that, as official East German discourse about the wartime persecution of Jews was subject to a Marxist interpretation of history, the topic was marginalized; in addition, {{the politics of the}} Cold War and the Arab-Israeli Conflict made the theme highly sensitive. Berghahn commented that the child was not {{in the center of the}} plot, but served as an [...] "infantile victim" [...] who had to be protected by the [...] "communist heroes... Beyer's film reaffirms the official GDR conception of the Holocaust." [...] Thiele also noted that the word 'Jew' is barely mentioned in the film or in the novel, mostly as part of antisemitic slurs used by the antagonists. Bill Niven concluded: [...] "It is not Jews who are seen to suffer, but Germans - for a Jew. Resistance and <b>victimhood</b> reside with Pippig, Höfel and Krämer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Altogether, around 8 million ethnic German {{refugees}} and expellees from across Europe eventually settled in West Germany, with a further 3 million in East Germany. [...] In West Germany these represented a major voting block; maintaining a strong culture of grievance and <b>victimhood</b> against Soviet Power, pressing for a continued commitment to full German reunification, claiming compensation, pursuing {{the right of}} return to lost property in the East, and opposing any recognition of the postwar extension of Poland and the Soviet Union into former German lands. Due to the Cold War rhetoric and successful political machinations of Konrad Adenauer, this block eventually became substantially aligned with the Christian Democratic Union of Germany; although in practice 'westward-looking' CDU policies favouring the Atlantic Alliance and the European Union worked against the possibility of achieving {{the objectives of the}} expellee population from the east through negotiation with the Soviet Union. But for Adenauer, fostering and encouraging unrealistic demands and uncompromising expectations amongst the expellees would serve his [...] "Policy of Strength" [...] by which West Germany contrived to inhibit consideration of unification or a final Peace Treaty until the West was strong enough to face the Soviets on equal terms. Consequently, the Federal Republic in the 1950s adopted much of the symbolism of expellee groups; especially in appropriating and subverting the terminology and imagery of the Holocaust; applying this to post-war German experience instead. [...] Eventually in 1990, following the Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany, the unified Germany indeed confirmed in treaties with Poland and the Soviet Union that the transfer of sovereignty over the former German eastern territories in 1945 had been permanent and irreversible; Germany now undertaking never again to make territorial claims in respect of these lands.|$|E
