40|$|In recent years, {{a bottom}} blown copper melting {{technology}} has been developed by Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals in China. The main unit of the technology is a bottom blown smelting furnace with a dimension of 4. 4 m in diameter and 16. 5 m in length. At {{the bottom of the}} furnace, there are nine lances aligned in two staggered rows, five in the upper row, 22 º offset from vertical line, and four in the lower row 7 º offset from vertical line. During smelting, oxygen enriched air is blown into molten bath from bottom lances and leads to different types of standing waves on bath surface. The features of the different standing waves are highly associated with bath splash, and can have an effect on refractory abrasion, matte droplet entrainment and settlement, and <b>viscous</b> <b>slag</b> tapping. This study aims to identify the types of standing waves that could occur in bottom blown furnace, summarise conditions of occurrence and analyse their amplitude and frequency to assist industrial operation...|$|E
40|$|Viscosity & flow {{characteristics}} of the Blast Furnace slag constitute twovery Important parameters for ensuring the smooth operation of the Blast Furnace producing pig iron. Ideally, the Blast Furnace slag should neither be very viscous nor very fluid. A <b>Viscous</b> <b>slag</b> interferes with efficient slag- metal separation; while a slag with very low viscosity {{is more likely to}} interfere with the thermal balance of the Furnace & affect the retention time of the metal droplets in the slag affecting the slagmetal reactions/ exchanges. Flow characteristics in the Blast Furnace slag can provide a fair knowledge about the location & extent of the cohesive zone in the Furnace. The cohesive zone in the Furnace acts as a gas distributor & its place lower down the Furnace would create less probability for the softened slag for choking the Furnace. Also a cohesive zone lower down the Furnace would result in less Si pick up in the hot metal. The present work aims at characterizing the Blast Furnace slag {{on the basis of its}} viscosity and {{flow characteristics}}. Empirical equations are developed to predict the flow characteristics of Blast Furnace slag and the same was validated through further experimentation. The viscosity of the Blast Furnace slag (synthetic one prepared in laboratory in line with the compositional details as encountered in the industry) is determined for C/S (CaO/SiO 2) variation, MgO content variation and TiO 2 variation and along with that to the simultaneous variation of C/S ratio & MgO content. The compositional dependence of the slag viscosity is discussed at length. ...|$|E
40|$|Thin low <b>viscous</b> plate <b>slags,</b> the {{so-called}} Plattenschlacke, {{are one of}} the 3 types of slags systematically encountered at Middle and Late Bronze Age copper smelting sites in the Alps. The two other types are coarse cake-like slags, and finely crushed slag sand. The exact origin of these different types of slags within the smelting process, and particularly that of the Plattenschlacke is still debated: do they belong to the same unique smelting step, or do they refer to separate operations? With respect to this issue, the Early Bronze Age (EBA) copper production site of Saint-Véran (Hautes-Alpes, France), one of the earliest copper mass production centre in the Alps, occupies an exceptional situation. Indeed, it provides not only one of the first evidence of Plattenschlacke in the Alps, but also Plattenschlacke is the only type of slags produced there. This paper aims at exploring further the "Plattenschlacke mystery" by proposing a reconstruction of the smelting process performed at Saint-Véran during the EBA, on the basis of thorough analytical investigation of the local Plattenschlacke. Conventional (OM, SEM-EDS, PIXE) as well as more unusual analytieal techniques were used, including Raman micro-spectrometry, Rietveld refmement on X-ray diffraction patterns, as well as micro-XANES...|$|R
40|$|The Peirce-Smith {{converter}} {{has served}} the copper industry well {{for over a}} century, but increasingly stringent environmental regulations and burgeoning energy costs have set the trend towards continuous copper matte converting. A major technical issue with continuous converting is the choice of slag. Iron silicate slags, as used in the Pierce-Smith converter, have many favourable properties including limited wear of the magnesia-chrome refractories and high ability to absorb elements with basic oxides such as lead oxide. Unfortunately, at the high oxygen partial pressures used during copper-making, they have too Iowa solubility for magnetite and this results in semi-solid <b>viscous</b> <b>slag.</b> Mitsubish i introduced calcium ferrite slag for their continuous converting process because it has high magnetite solubility and high ability to remove elements with acidic oxides such as antimony and arsenic, but it attacks magnesia-chrome refractories severely. Ferrous calcium silicate (FCS) slag has been proposed as a third slag for copper converting. It has been predicted that FCS slag should not be aggressive towards refractories and would have a low copper oxide solubility and suitable solubility for magnetite and both acidic and basic impurity metal oxides. Little {{is known about the}} properties of FCS slag, in particular its affect on the wear of magnesia-chrome refractories and the distribution ratio of minor elements between it and copper. The purpose of this research was to test the potential of FCS slag for application in continuous copper converting. Firstly, refractory wear was investigated and compared to the wear caused by calcium ferrite slag. Secondly, distribution of antimony, lead and nickel between FCS slag and copper was determined. It was found that FCS slag attacks the refractories far less than calcium ferrite slag. The slag/metal distribution ratios for nickel, lead and antimony were determined to be 0. 98, 0. 93, and 0. 54 respectively. These compare very favorably to those for calcium ferrite slag. It was concluded that FCS slag has potential for continuous copper converting and warrants further consideration by industry...|$|E
40|$|This Technology in Industry Fellowship (TIF) funded Masters Project was {{structured}} around Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling for Lemar Environmental Ltd (Lemar). This {{study is}} a component of a larger programme that is being undertaken by Lemar concerning the vitrification process. The modelling has built on an initial model developed by CSIRO for Lemar and {{has been carried out}} under the direction of Canterbury University. The modelling involved computer simulations and detailed comparisons of the gas flow for both high and low swirl vanes, in both the steady state and transient modes. The output of this activity; velocity profiles (tangential and axial), vorticity, as well as particle tracking (in steady state mode only) were compared to literature and evaluated for both scenarios. As the study was restricted to the gas flow in transient mode, no recommendations and extrapolated modifications to the burner geometry and plant equipment can be made as they have to be verified by the particle motion within the gas flow. The steady state particle simulations obtained through this project, did not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that particles attach to the outer wall and only demonstrated the influences that the high and low swirl had on the particles. Further investigations of transient particle tracking would provide an overall interpretation {{as to whether or not}} the dried sludge particles bounced or stuck to the <b>viscous</b> <b>slag</b> layer and a commentary as to their movement in the chamber. Lemar's strategic vitrification programme is still active and the resulting redesign process is nearing completion and modifications to the plant are expected to be finalised by January 2008. Following extensive testing by Lemar it is understood that they would be looking to seek venture capital in order to progress the project to the market. In order for the final stage of the sewage sludge vitrification plant project to commence, Lemar has been in consultation with subject matter experts in the field, as well as undertaking trials on the plant, computer modelling and research into both the technical and international marketing prospects for the combustion technology. The detailed analysis and research undertaken through the CFD modelling conducted for this Project, recommends that Lemar conducts further CFD modelling to investigate transient particle tracking before any plant or geometry modifications are proposed and undertaken in order to optimise the ash capture which is a key output of the vitrification process...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Process Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The {{electric}} {{smelting furnace}} is {{found at the}} heart of the platinum recovery process where the power input from the electrodes produces a complex interplay between heat transfer and fluid flow. A fundamental knowledge of the dynamic system hosted by the electric furnace is valuable for maintaining stable and optimum operation. However, describing the character of the system hosted by the electric furnace poses great difficulty due to its aggressive environment. A full-scale threedimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was therefore developed for the circular, three-electrode Lonmin smelting furnace. The model was solved as time dependent to incorporate the effect of the three-phase AC current, which was supplied by means of volume sources representing the electrodes. The slag and matte layers were both modelled as fluid continuums in contact with each other through a dynamic interface made possible by the Volume of Fluid (VOF) multi-phase model. CO-gas bubbles forming at electrode surfaces and interacting with the surrounding fluid slag were modelled through the Discrete Phase Model (DPM). To account for the effect of concentrate melting, distinctive smelting zones were identified within the concentrate as assigned a portion of the melting heat based on the assumption of a radially decreasing smelting rate from the centre of the furnace. The tapping of slag and matte was neglected in the current modelling approach but compensation was made for the heating-up of descending material by means of an energy sink based on enthalpy differences. Model cases with and without CO-gas bubbles were investigated as well as the incorporation of a third phase between the slag and matte for representing the ‘mushy’ chromite/highly <b>viscous</b> <b>slag</b> commonly found in this region. These models were allowed to iterate until steady state conditions has been achieved, which for most of the cases involved several weeks of simulation time. The results that were obtained provided good insight into the electrical, heat and flow behaviour present within the molten bath. The current density profiles showed a large portion of the current to flow via the matte layer between the electrodes. Distributions for the electric potential and Joule heat within the melt was also developed and showed the highest power to be generated within the immediate vicinity of the electrodes and 98 % of the resistive heat to be generated within the slag. Heat was found to be uniformly distributed due the slag layer being well mixed. The CO-gas bubbles was shown to be an important contributor to flow within the slag, resulting in a order of magnitude difference in average flow magnitude compared to the case where only natural buoyancy is at play. The highest flow activity was observed halfway between electrodes where the flow streams from the electrodes meet. Consequently, the highest temperatures are also observed in these regions. The temperature distribution within the matte and concentrate layers can be characterized as stratified. Low flow regions were identified within the matte and bottom slag layer which is where chromite and magnitite deposits are prone to accumulate. The model results were partially validated through good agreement to published results where actual measurements were done while also falling within the typical operating range for the actual furnace. The modelling of the electric furnace has been valuably furthered, however for complete confidence in the model results, further validation is strongly recommended...|$|E
40|$|Entrained flow {{gasification}} (EFG) is a well-proven, {{commercially available}} technology for large scale coal gasification processes, with {{a production of}} a high quality syngas (a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H 2), carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and other compounds). For biomass, the process is still under development {{and there are several}} hurdles that must be cleared before it can become commercial. In entrained flow gasification, solid fuel particles are milled to a size of a couple of hundred micrometers to ensure good heat and mass transfer with the surrounding hot gases, priorto be fed in a co-flow of oxidizer stream that can be either air or pure oxygen. The milled biomass particles have cohesive behavior and poor flowability, leading to serious challenges associated with consistent particle feeding and effective mixing. The pulverized fuel injector is {{a vital part of the}} gasification/combustion system and a well optimized fuel injector can help to promote the process efficiency by enhancing mixing, minimizing pollutant emission and fuel consumption. Biomass differs from coal not only in chemical composition (in terms of carbon, oxygen, volatile etc. contents) butalso in aerodynamic properties depending upon some factors, e. g. shape sphericity, aspect ratio, particle size, bulk density and particle cohesion force etc. One of the key challenges to implement biomass in entrained flow gasification is to ensure a good mixing of biomass particles with the oxidizer stream. A common concept is to impart swirling motion into the oxidizer stream, forming a recirculated hot gas flow that can participate in the gasification. The dispersion behavior of biomass particles in turbulentisothermal swirling flows has therefore been studied by using a two-phase particle image velocimetry technique. This technique provides simultaneous measurements of continuous (air) and disperse phase (pulverized pine particles) velocities. The results show that the addition of pulverized pine particles (with a size range of 112 - 160 μm) into turbulent air flow significantly affect the dispersion rate and velocity fields of thesuspending air flow in the burner near field, inducing a “blockage effect” where the air velocity is reduced along the jet core corresponding to a region of high particle concentration. It was also found that imparting swirling motion to the co-annular jet flow increased the particle dispersion due to strong centrifugal effects induced by the swirling motion. The entrained flow gasifier is operated at high temperatures to maintain high conversionand high cold gas efficiency, resulting in low tar yields, high oxygen demand and a <b>viscous</b> <b>slag</b> flow. High operating temperatures also favors soot formation that can be detrimental to the operation of the gasifier, e. g. clogging of flow passages, fouling on system components and reduced efficiency of gasification. A novel soot reduction method on the basis of forced dispersion of fuel particles has therefore been applied toa laboratory scaled entrained flow reactor. Pulverized pine particles with a size of 63 - 112 μm were gasified in a sub-stoichiometric methane-air flame stabilized on a flat burner. Soot formation was measured along the reactor height in terms of volume fraction by a two-color laser extinction method. The results show that particle dispersion and inter-particle distance were enhanced by varying the flow velocity ratio between the particle carrier gas and the premixed flame. The soot volume fraction was found todecrease towards an asymptotic value with increasing inter-particle distance. There are other techniques to control particle dispersion and promote mixing, e. g. acoustic forcing or a synthetic jet flow. Both techniques induce a periodic motion to the gas phase flow that influences the motion of solid fuel particles. A synthetic jet actuator was used in both isothermal and reactive flows in a laboratory scale entrained flow reactor. It was found that the synthetic jet actuator formed local flows of dilute and dense gas particle suspensions via a convection effect induced by large scale flow structures. It was also shown that the synthetic jet actuator provided controlled particle dispersionin isothermal flows with respect to forcing amplitudes. The resulting flow field imposed significant effects on the amount of soot formed during gasification of pulverized pine particles. Acoustic forcing was applied to a 150 kW wood powder burner to excite one of thenatural system instabilities during combustion of wood powder particles. The effect of the instabilities on the flame shape and NOx formation were investigated at differentair/fuel ratios. The powder flame gave a quick response to external flow perturbations at 17 Hz showing irregular wobbling and increased NOx emission in the presence of acoustic excitation. Based on the experiences gained from the experiments, dispersion characteristics of particle-laden flow are of utmost importance to reliably predict and optimize pollutant emission. Controlled particle dispersion can be simply achieved by external forcing ofthe gas flow by a synthetic jet actuator without any need of a source of external fluid or time-consuming, expensive burner modifications.
