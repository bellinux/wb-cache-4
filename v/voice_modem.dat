50|$|Each <b>voice</b> <b>modem</b> {{platform}} {{tends to}} support {{either one of}} two sets of voice commands - in particular, one flavor of the command set contains a + sign, and the other contains a # sign.|$|E
5000|$|Because voice mode is not {{the typical}} use for a modem, many modems on the market have poor or buggy support for their voice modes. Characteristics of a good <b>voice</b> <b>modem</b> depend greatly upon the {{intended}} application, and include: ...|$|E
50|$|Voice modems are regular modems {{that are}} capable of {{recording}} or playing audio over the telephone line. They are used for telephony applications. See <b>Voice</b> <b>modem</b> command set for more details on voice modems. This type of modem can be used as an FXO card for Private branch exchange systems (compare V.92).|$|E
50|$|TAPI {{can also}} be used to control voice-enabled {{telephony}} devices, including <b>voice</b> <b>modems</b> and dedicated hardware such as Dialogic cards.|$|R
5000|$|CallAttendant, CallAttendant Home, CallAttendant Pro: Discontinued {{home and}} small {{business}} products that worked TAPI based devices (primarily <b>voice</b> <b>modems)</b> to provide advanced call answering capabilities.|$|R
5000|$|Some <b>voice</b> <b>modems</b> have bugs {{in their}} {{implementation}} of flow control. In particular, {{a large number}} of Conexant chipsets will sometimes drop their CTS line and never bring it back up during playback. Conexant is a hugely popular chipset in <b>voice</b> <b>modems</b> today and they otherwise implement voice commands well, making it worthwhile to consider working around this bug. Some Conexant chipsets will also not bring CTS back up if the [...] "playback abort" [...] command is sent or processed by the modem while CTS is down.|$|R
50|$|Technology {{infrastructure}} design {{addresses the}} telecommunications cabling systems that run throughout data centers. There are cabling systems for all data center environments, including horizontal cabling, <b>voice,</b> <b>modem,</b> and facsimile telecommunications services, premises switching equipment, computer and telecommunications management connections, keyboard/video/mouse connections and data communications. Wide area, local area, and storage area networks should link with other building signaling systems (e.g. fire, security, power, HVAC, EMS).|$|E
50|$|A <b>voice</b> <b>modem</b> is {{an analog}} {{telephone}} data modem {{with a built-in}} capability of transmitting and receiving voice recordings over the phone line. Voice modems are used for telephony and answering machine applications. Similar to the Hayes command set used for data modems, in which the host PC commands the modem via a series of commands known as AT commands, there exists a well-defined set of common voice AT commands that are somewhat consistent throughout the industry.|$|E
50|$|MF {{and other}} in-band {{signaling}} systems differ from Signaling System 7 (SS7) {{in that the}} routing digits are out-pulsed in MF format in the same voiceband channel used for voice. The dialing user cannot detect these digits being out-pulsed because the audio connection is not established {{all the way to}} the userâ€™s handset or device until after the connection is established with the terminating switch. Following a full connection, the same audio channel is connected to the user in order to communicate the <b>voice,</b> <b>modem</b> or fax data across that same 64-kbit channel previously used for the in-band MF signaling.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{advancement}} of computer software technology {{at the end of}} the 20th century, many hardware-based telephony capabilities for auto dialing can be implemented in software. <b>Voice</b> <b>modems</b> are much less expensive and some computers have them pre-installed already. Touch tones, call transfer, call progress detection, detection of answering machine and voice mail, and other telephony card features, are available in voice modem-based auto dialing systems. For a simple autodialer supporting only a few phone lines per PC, telephony cards offer few advantages over simple <b>voice</b> <b>modems.</b>|$|R
50|$|Computers can, with {{appropriate}} software and modem, emulate a V.18 TTY. Some <b>voice</b> <b>modems,</b> coupled {{with appropriate}} software, {{can now be}} converted to TTY modems by using a software-based decoder for TTY tones. Same {{can be done with}} such software using a computer's sound card, when coupled to the telephone line.|$|R
5000|$|On Windows, TAPI {{support was}} almost {{universal}} in telephony hardware such as <b>voice</b> <b>modems</b> (both internal and external) and computer expansion boards such as Dialogic telephony cards.

5000|$|Some <b>voice</b> <b>modems</b> offer a {{very large}} {{transmit}} buffer (for example, 4 seconds worth of audio) coupled with a bug that prevents the host from requesting an [...] "abort playback". The result {{is that if a}} caller presses a touch-tone that's supposed to interrupt a message, and the host is providing unlimited audio data mediated by CTS alone, the end result is that the message can't be interrupted for at least 4 seconds.|$|R
50|$|<b>Voice</b> <b>modems</b> do not {{automatically}} hang up {{even when the}} caller {{on the other end}} does. They may report the hangup, dialtone, or silence events, but {{it is up to the}} computer to act upon them. If when the modem is recording, the caller hangs up and the computer doesn't react, the modem will continue providing the audio recording everything else heard on the line, such as dial tones, telephone company error messages, and so forth.|$|R
50|$|For example, when {{considering}} using dummy DLE stuffing, {{a few things}} must first be noted. In a typical scenario, one second of audio might be 8000 one-byte samples, and with {{a small percentage of}} the samples being equal to the DLE byte and must be doubled, a typical second of audio might be 8050 bytes. The trick involves inserting enough meaningless DLE messages into the bytes that the modem will discard (that is, a DLE followed by a byte without any specific meaning) so that there are exactly 11520 bytes (assuming a serial port locked at 115200 bit/s) which will take exactly 1 second to transmit through the serial port. Although it is possible that interrupt latency on the host PC may cause slightly less than 11520 bytes to be sent per second, most <b>voice</b> <b>modems</b> will buffer enough bytes before actually starting playback to permit a small skew here. Also the PC can be programmed to convert a second of audio into slightly fewer than 11520 bytes (all <b>voice</b> <b>modems</b> will buffer a small overrun without the need for flow control as long as it is no more than a few hundred bytes).|$|R
40|$|The Internet's phenomenal growth, {{worldwide}} {{coverage and}} increasing data delivery capabilities have made possible its {{use as an}} alternative communications medium for real-time voice messages. In addition, using the Internet medium for voice communication circumvents {{the high costs of}} long-distance phone rates. This paper discusses the functional architectural design of an Internet Telephony Gateway (ITG) to support real-time Internet voice communication using conventional telephone system (PSTN). The design uses <b>voice</b> <b>modem</b> and sound card to provide the basic interface with the PSTN. This interface is complemented with software functions that control the modem's operations. In addition, the ITG handles voice communication over the Internet according to an internationally recognised standard, ITU H. 323 Recommendation. 1.

40|$|Network access systems (NAS) such as {{digital loop}} {{carriers}} (DLC) are increasingly utilizing a shared medium, such as Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC) to provide point to multi-point access {{from the public}} switched telephone network (PSTN) to the end user (consumer). New services, such as direct access to the packet switched network (PSN, WWW) have been added to DLC equipment {{in such a way as}} to provide for a prioritized set of services over a shared medium in an effort to take advantage of otherwise unused bandwidth. With the introduction of such services comes the added complexity of traffic analysis and modeling these network access systems, particularly when considering the variability in different service type traffic characteristics. This work identifies a traffic engineering problem of prioritized circuit switched and packet switched (PSTN/PSN) traffic over the same shared medium as it may relate to "perceived" quality of service (QoS). A brief review of the evolution of models for communications traffic is presented. Models are then proposed and developed for the various traffic types being considered, which include <b>voice,</b> <b>modem,</b> and data. These models become the basis for running simulations using the OPNET Modeler simulation software package, modeling a prioritized shared medium with finite bandwidth under varying source and offered load conditions. Simulation results suggest that at high (but typical) concentration ratios, small numbers of data users could experience QoS degradation when combined with sufficient numbers of modem and/or voice users. Finally, recommendations for potential future work are offered...|$|E
40|$|The North Dakota Agricultural Weather Network (NDAWN) {{consists}} of 70 automated weather stations distributed among prime agricultural locations across North Dakota, the Red River Valley, and border regions of surrounding states. The NDAWN Center {{is a part}} of the Department of Soil Science, North Dakota State University. The NDAWN stations measure wind speed and direction, air temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, pressure (32 stations), atmospheric moisture and soil temperatures under bare and turf at 10 cm (4 inch) depth. The center provides daily summaries consisting of maximums and minimums as well as time of occurrence, and various totals or averages for all variables in English or metric units. Measured and calculated variables along with complete descriptions are available. The NDAWN Center web site: [URL] allows direct access to NDAWN data in various special and temporal scales. The <b>voice</b> <b>modem</b> accommodates those who do not have internet access. The NDAWN Center has assisted many North Dakotans in making weather critical decisions concerning their crops, livestock, and livelihood. One direct benefit of NDAWN data was helping to save the 1993 - 94 potato crops in North Dakota. The stations provide weather data, which was instrumental in developing an agricultural model called the late blight model. This model predicts when leaf disease can occur in potato plants. Late blight doesnâ€™t occur in North Dakota every year and is prevalent during cool and moist periods of weather. In 1993 - 94, this model predicted that late blight would occur and growers were able to use fungicide applications to prevent the disease. Another direct benefit of NDAWN data is that it provides universities and the National Weather Service with an additional database for research and forecasting applications. Agriculture remains the number one industry in North Dakota and its success will always be dependent on the weather...|$|E
5000|$|A second way to {{throttle}} playback involves polling a [...] "tick" [...] timer {{provided by}} the host computer's operating system and based on a hardware clock that's independent of the host's CPU load. This {{may or may not}} be available, and it depends entirely on the host operating system. However, when available, it is extremely reliable. It is reasonable to assume that the PC needs to stay ahead of the playback by a couple of hundred bytes and that the modem will buffer this. (The commands AT+VBQ or AT#VBQ on <b>voice</b> <b>modems</b> will often reveal the size of the buffer in bytes, and 1-2 kilobytes is a typical response).|$|R

50|$|As {{shown in}} the diagram below, a T.38 gateway is {{composed}} of two primary elements: the fax modems and the T.38 subsystem.

The PSTN network samples the analog signal of a <b>voice</b> or <b>modem</b> signal (it doesnâ€™t know the difference) 8,000 times per second (SPS), and encodes them as 8-bit data bytes.
