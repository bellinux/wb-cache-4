5|$|The natives {{launched}} a furious mass assault against Santa María de Comayagua. The depleted garrison fought {{its way out}} under cover of night and {{set out on a}} desperate march to Gracias a Dios, leaving the town to be sacked – not even the livestock were spared. All across the province the Spanish were short of soldiers, arms and supplies, except at the Peñol de Cerquín, which remained the focus of Spanish attention. In a <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time, Spanish control had collapsed across Honduras; only two small Spanish pockets remained – at Gracias and San Pedro. Montejo sent Gonzalo de Alvarado to San Salvador to seek assistance, which was readily supplied in the form of 100 Indian auxiliaries, 1000 Indian carriers, livestock, arquebuses, crossbows, gunpowder, ammunition, shields, spears, armour and iron. Further supplies were forthcoming from San Miguel, but similar requests sent to Guatemala were largely rebuffed, as a response to Montejo's policies which were perceived as undermining the rights of Guatemalan colonists.|$|E

25|$|Iron {{smelting}} was {{not new to}} the Sussex Weald: the Romans had a forge at Oldlands in Buxted, {{where their}} coins have been found. But the large-scale forging of weaponry was new. In a <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time the English made themselves masters {{of the art of}} gun-making. The Sussex landscape is sprinkled with names redolent of the forges: Furnace Wood, Furnace Pond, Minepit Wood, Little Forge, Culver Wood, Slag Meadow, Huggett's Furnace, and Hammerpond.|$|E
25|$|Evolution can be {{extremely}} rapid, {{as shown by the}} creation of domesticated animals and plants in a <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> geological time, spanning only a few tens of thousands of years, by humans with little or no knowledge of genetics. Maize, Zea mays, for instance, was created in Mexico in only a few thousand years, starting about 7000 to 12000 years ago. This raises the question of why the long term rate of evolution is far slower than is theoretically possible.|$|E

This was allegedly due to pressure from Fear Factory's new label Calvin Records, which preponed the album's release date from four months away to just {{a month and a half}} so the band would have a new album to support on the inaugural Gigantour, which they had been invited to participate on by Dave Mustaine.|$|E
25|$|The {{amygdala}} {{plays a role}} in {{the conscious}} awareness of emotion (feelings) resulting in perception of feeling, but experiments suggest the left and right amygdala have distinct roles in conscious and unconscious processing of emotion. The right amygdala {{plays a role in}} the nonconscious processing of emotion while the left amygdala was involved in the processing of conscious emotions. These results were obtained from studies that masked conditioning stimuli. Stimuli were presented over a <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time such that subjects were not consciously aware of the stimuli but were still able to show physiological changes.|$|E

Postgraduate education is the fastest growing sector, with 24.1 percent more students recruited and 25.9 percent more researchers than the year before. This enrollment growth indicates that China has entered the stage of popular education.

25|$|Analysis of {{the lunar}} samples seems to imply that a {{significant}} percentage {{of the lunar}} impact basins formed within a <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time between about 4 and 3.85 Ga ago. This hypothesis {{is referred to as the}} lunar cataclysm or late heavy bombardment. However, it is now recognized that ejecta from the Imbrium impact basin (one of the youngest large impact basins on the Moon) should be found at all of the Apollo landing sites. It is thus possible that ages for some impact basins (in particular Mare Nectaris) could have been mistakenly assigned the same age as Imbrium.|$|E

2500|$|This {{primarily}} {{involves the}} person being {{lifted from the}} ground by their wrists. This is usually achieved by use of rope or by special suspension cuffs. When using rope, extreme damage can be caused to the soft tissues of the wrists, as well as reducing circulation, so being suspended by ropes can only normally be achieved for a <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. Often in fiction and movies a person may be pictured hanging from metal cuffs or handcuffs. This is possible, although extremely painful and will leave deep marks in the wrists.
