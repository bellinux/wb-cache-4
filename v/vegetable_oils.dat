5|$|<b>Vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> are {{triglycerides}} {{extracted from}} plants. Such as oils {{have been part}} of human culture for millennia. Edible <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> are used in food, both in cooking and as supplements. Many oils, edible and otherwise, are burned as fuel, such as in oil lamps and as a substitute for petroleum-based fuels. Some of the many other uses include wood finishing, oil painting, and skin care.|$|E

5|$|Drying oils are <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> that dry to a hard {{finish at}} normal room temperature. Such oils {{are used as}} the basis of oil paints, and in other paint and wood {{finishing}} applications. In addition to the oils listed here, walnut, sunflower and safflower oil are also considered to be drying oils.|$|E
25|$|In the {{recycling}} industry, used cooking oil recovered from restaurants and food-processing industries (typically from deep fryers or griddles) is called recycled <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> (RVO), used <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> (UVO), waste <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> (WVO), or yellow grease.|$|R
25|$|<b>Vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> {{can be used}} as an {{alternative}} fuel in diesel engines and in heating <b>oil</b> burners. When <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> is used directly as a fuel, in either modified or unmodified equipment, it is referred to as straight <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> (SVO) or pure plant oil (PPO). Conventional diesel engines can be modified to help ensure that the viscosity of the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> is low enough to allow proper atomization of the fuel. This prevents incomplete combustion, which would damage the engine by causing a build-up of carbon. Straight <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> can also be blended with conventional diesel or processed into biodiesel or bioliquids for use under a wider range of conditions.|$|R
2500|$|Oil price {{increases}} since 2003 resulted in {{increased demand for}} biofuels. [...] Transforming <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> into biodiesel is not very hard or costly {{so there is a}} profitable arbitrage situation if <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> is much cheaper than diesel. [...] Diesel is also made from crude <b>oil,</b> so <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> prices are partially linked to crude oil prices. [...] Farmers can switch to growing <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> crops if those are more profitable than food crops. So all food prices are linked to <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> prices, and in turn to crude oil prices. A World Bank study concluded that oil prices and a weak dollar explain 25–30% of total price rise between January 2002 until June 2008.|$|R

Airborne low concentrations of osmium tetroxide vapor can cause lung congestion and skin or eye damage, and should therefore {{be used in a}} fume hood. Osmium tetroxide is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by polyunsaturated <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils,</b> such as corn oil.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils,</b> are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

Agriculture deals with the production of food crops, and has {{played a key role}} in the history of world civilizations. Agriculture includes agronomy for arable crops, horticulture for vegetables and fruit, and forestry for timber. About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major staples include cereals such as rice and wheat, starchy roots and tubers such as cassava and potato, and legumes such as peas and beans. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> such as olive oil provide lipids, while fruit and vegetables contribute vitamins and minerals to the diet.|$|E

5|$|As a {{response}} to recent obesity trends in the United States and other nations, Burger King modified its menu and food preparation practices. In addition to offering lower-fat menu item such as salads, the company has updated its nutrition guides to include dietary guidelines and other nutritional data. One of its reactions to the concerns over trans-fats was to initiate a program in January 2008 to phase out added trans-fat in its products, and to switch to pure <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> that are free of hydrogenated fats. The program ended in early 2009 with a complete changeover to the new oils. Most, but not all, of the products contain no added trans-fats; some products, such as the beef used in the hamburgers, still contain naturally occurring trans-fats.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} use of {{platinum}} is {{as a catalyst}} in chemical reactions, often as platinum black. It has been employed as a catalyst since the early 19th century, when platinum powder was used to catalyze the ignition of hydrogen. Its most important application is in automobiles as a catalytic converter, which allows the complete combustion of low concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons from the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst {{in a number of}} separate processes, but especially in catalytic reforming of straight-run naphthas into higher-octane gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO2, also known as Adams' catalyst, is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, specifically for <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils.</b> Platinum also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and it is used in fuel cells as a catalyst for the reduction of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} types of plant oils, {{distinguished}} by the method used to extract the oil from the plant. The relevant part of the plant may be placed under pressure to extract the oil, giving an expressed (or pressed) oil. The oils included in this list are of this type. Oils may also be extracted from plants by dissolving parts of plants in water or another solvent. The solution may {{be separated from the}} plant material and concentrated, giving an extracted or leached oil. The mixture may also be separated by distilling the oil away from the plant material. Oils extracted by this latter method are called essential oils. Essential oils often have different properties and uses than pressed or leached <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils.</b> Finally, macerated oils are made by infusing parts of plants in a base oil, a process called liquid-liquid extraction.|$|E
5|$|Potash is {{primarily}} a mixture of potassium salts because plants {{have little or no}} sodium content, and the rest of a plant's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789. For a long time the only significant applications for potash were the production of glass, bleach, soap and gunpowder as potassium nitrate. Potassium soaps from animal fats and <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> were especially prized because they tend to be more water-soluble and of softer texture, and are therefore known as soft soaps. The discovery by Justus Liebig in 1840 that potassium is a necessary element for plants and that most types of soil lack potassium caused a steep rise in demand for potassium salts. Wood-ash from fir trees was initially used as a potassium salt source for fertilizer, but, with the discovery in 1868 of mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near Staßfurt, Germany, the production of potassium-containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale. Other potash deposits were discovered, and by the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer.|$|E
50|$|Brominated <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> (BVO) is {{a complex}} mixture of plant-derived {{triglycerides}} that have been reacted to contain atoms of the element bromine bonded to the molecules.

However, <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> are less stable chemically, so they are generally used in systems where they are not exposed to oxygen, and they are more expensive than crude oil distillate. Synthetic tetraesters, which are similar to <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> but with four fatty acid chains compared to the normal three found in a natural ester, are manufactured by Fischer esterification. Tetraesters generally have high stability to oxidation and have found use as engine lubricants. Vegetable oil is being used to produce biodegradable hydraulic fluid and lubricant.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Feruloylated <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> is a {{valuable}} green bioproduct that has several cosmeceutical applications associated with its inherent anti-oxidant and ultraviolet-absorption properties. Hydrolyzed <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> by-products can influence product quality and consistency. RESULTS: The formation of by-products by residual water in the enzymatic synthesis of feruloylated <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> was investigated using chemical theory and experimental studies by monitoring the reaction over a 22 -day period. The hydrolysis of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> is thermodynamically favored over the hydrolysis of the ethyl ferulate starting material. These results suggest that hydrolyzed <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> products will be experimentally observed in greater concentrations compared to hydrolyzed ethyl ferulate products. CONCLUSION: Quantum chemical studies identified several reaction mechanisms that explain the formation of side products by water, suggesting that residual water influences product quality. Efforts to reduce residual water can improve product consistency and reduce purification costs...|$|R
