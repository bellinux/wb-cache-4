40|$|High Temperature (HT째) {{motor coils}} open new {{perspectives}} for extending the applications of electrical motors or generators to very harsh environments or for designing very high power density machines working with high internal temperature gradients. Over {{a temperature of}} 300 째C, the classic enameled wire cannot work permanently, the turn-to-turn insulation must be inorganic and made with high temperature textiles or <b>vitro-ceramic</b> compounds. For both cases, a diffusion barrier must protect the copper wire against oxidation. The usual solution consists of adding a nickel layer that yields an excellent chemical protection. Unfortunately, the nickel has ferromagnetic properties that change a lot the skin effect in the HT wire at high frequencies. For many applications such as aeronautics, electrical machines are always associated with PWM inverters for their control. The windings must resist to high voltage short spikes caused by the fast fronted pulses imposed by the feeding inverter. The nickel protection layer of the HT째 inorganic wire has a large influence on the high frequency behavior of coils and, consequently, on {{the magnitude of the}} voltage spikes. A good knowledge of the non-linear magnetic characteristics of this nickel layer is helpful for designing reliable HT inorganic coils. The paper presents a method able to characterize non-linear electromagnetic properties of this nickel layer up to 500 째C...|$|E
40|$|Out of {{the three}} {{quantities}} that characterize the state of an isolated gaseous body: pressure, temperature and volume the radius {{is the only one}} directly measurable for the Sun, what is specially true in the optical window and for ground base measurements. The Heliometer of Observatorio Nacional, in Rio de Janeiro, measures the distance between two opposite limbs of the Sun in the same field of view, through the reflection on a 10 cm parabolic mirror split on its half and forming an appropriate angle. This configuration is free from optical aberrations and focal variations along the measurement direction. The mirrors are made on CCZ <b>vitro-ceramic</b> and the telescope structure is of carbon steel, resulting that there is no flexion or temperature deformation. The instrument is compact, and can perform hundreds of measurements per duty day, around all heliolatitudes. It attains an accuracy on the solar radius of 0. 01 arcsec, becoming the ideal instrument to monitor from the ground the solar diameter, and to bridge satellites and astrolabes historical series of data. We discuss the first years of regular observation, with emphasis on the instrumental calibrations and on the statistic study of the derived time series, attitude series, and solar geometry series. On basis of these series we obtain how well the Heliometer and Solar Astrolabe results are matched.
