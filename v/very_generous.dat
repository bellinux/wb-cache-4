5|$|In 1467, Catherine sailed {{towards the}} Italian Peninsula, {{possibly}} {{at the suggestion}} of the Veronese humanist Leonardo Montagna, who dedicated two poems to her. She took her own vessel and disembarked in Ancona. By 29 October 1467, the Queen was in Rome, already receiving a <b>very</b> <b>generous</b> pension from the Papal State. Upon arrival, she rented a house for herself and her entourage, consisting of Bosnian nobility who had followed her. On 1 October 1469, she moved to the rione of Pigna, into a house near San Marco Evangelista al Campidoglio. Pope Sixtus IV gave her considerable property adjacent to the Tiber.|$|E
5|$|Don Vito {{brought the}} {{organization}} to its highest perfection without undue recourse to violence. The Mafia leader who scatters corpses all over the island {{in order to achieve}} his goal is considered as inept as the statesman who has to wage aggressive wars. Don Vito ruled and inspired fear mainly by the use of his great qualities and natural ascendancy. His awe-inspiring appearance helped him. … His manners were princely, his demeanour humble but majestic. He was loved by all. Being <b>very</b> <b>generous</b> by nature, he never refused a request for aid and dispensed millions in loans, gifts and general philanthropy. He would personally go {{out of his way to}} redress a wrong. When he started a journey, every major, dressed in his best clothes, awaited him at the entrance of his village, kissed his hands, and paid homage, as if he were a king. And he was a king of sorts: under his reign peace and order were observed, the Mafia peace, of course, which was not what the official law of the Kingdom of Italy would have imposed, but people did not stop to draw too fine a distinction.|$|E
5|$|Tvrtko acted resolutely and efficiently. He and Jelena {{took refuge}} at the Hungarian royal court, {{where they were}} welcomed by Tvrtko's former enemy and overlord, King Louis. Apparently {{dissatisfied}} with the turn of events in Bosnia, Louis provided Tvrtko with aid (likely military) in reclaiming Bosnia. Tvrtko returned to Bosnia in March and reestablished control over {{a part of the}} country {{by the end of the}} month, including the areas of Donji Kraji, Rama (where he then resided), Hum, and Usora. In order to secure the loyalty of the noblemen he had subjugated, as well as to win over those still supporting Vuk, Tvrtko bestowed a number of grants; in August he invested Vukac Hrvatinić with the entire župa of Pliva for his part in the 1363 war with Hungary. After initially rapid success, Tvrtko's campaign slowed. Sanko Miltenović, ruler of eastern Hum, defected to Vuk in late 1366. Throughout the following year, Tvrtko forced Vuk southwards, eventually compelling him to flee to Ragusa. Sanko, Vuk's last supporter, submitted to Tvrtko in late summer and was allowed to retain his holdings. Ragusan officials made an effort to procure peace between the feuding brothers, and in 1368, Vuk asked Pope Urban V to intervene with King Louis I on his behalf. Those efforts were futile; but by 1374, Tvrtko had reconciled with Vuk on <b>very</b> <b>generous</b> terms.|$|E

25|$|In Iraq, Rashid Ali al-Kaylani, the Iraqi Prime Minister, {{announced}} that the Assyrians should find a new home outside Iraq and promised that the Iraqi government was willing to make <b>very</b> <b>generous</b> contributions to cover any expenses of such settlement. On October 13, 1933, the League of Nations appointed a committee of six of its members to look into this possibility.|$|E
25|$|Lu Su {{was from}} Dongcheng County (東城縣), Linhuai Commandery (臨淮郡), {{which is located}} {{southeast}} of present-day Dingyuan County, Anhui. He lost his father not long after he was born, so {{he lived with his}} grandmother. Lu Su was <b>very</b> <b>generous</b> with his family's wealth as he used it to help the needy. The Wu Shu (吳書; Book of Wu), by Wei Zhao, described Lu Su as having a stalwart and extraordinary appearance. He had great ambitions since he was young and was very fond of strategy.|$|E
60|$|One {{sees the}} same, {{but far more}} strongly, in little children. From their {{earliest}} years, as far as I have ever seen, children like and admire what is good, even though they be naughty themselves; and if you tell them of any <b>very</b> loving, <b>generous,</b> or brave action, their hearts leap up in answer to it. They feel at once how beautiful goodness is.|$|R

25|$|As Zhuge Dan {{was close}} friends with Xiahou Xuan and Deng Yang (鄧颺) – both were Cao Shuang's {{associates}} – and had witnessed {{the downfall of}} Wang Ling and Guanqiu Jian, he felt very uneasy and was worried that he would become {{a victim of the}} Sima family's purges. Thus, when he was stationed in Shouchun (壽春; present-day Shou County, Anhui), he attempted to increase his popularity among the masses in the Huai River area by being <b>very</b> <b>generous.</b> He also used his personal wealth to bribe his subordinates and hire thousands of mercenaries as bodyguards. He even pardoned criminals who committed capital offences.|$|E
25|$|The service ran at a {{loss and}} had been {{supported}} by government subsidies until these were abolished for all long-distance passenger trains in 1989. New Zealand Rail changed the seating configuration by replacing the <b>very</b> <b>generous</b> seat pitch three abreast configuration with a more standard four abreast, with reduced (but still generous compared to bus) seat pitch. The full service buffet car was replaced with a buffet servery. Both measures reduced costs significantly, but the service was challenged by {{the increasing number of}} low-cost shuttle bus services, particularly between Christchurch and Dunedin, which were significantly cheaper than the train. Nonetheless, the Southerner still operated seven days a week, one service each way.|$|E

25|$|UIL {{agitation}} by tenant farmers {{continued to}} press for compulsory land purchase and resulted in the calling of the December 1902 Land Conference, an initiative by moderate landlords led by Lord Dunraven {{on the one hand}} and William O'Brien, John Redmond MP, Timothy Harrington MP and Ulster's T. W. Russell MP representing tenant farmers on the other hand. It strove for a settlement by conciliatory agreement between landlord and tenant. After six sittings all eight tenant's demands were conceded, O'Brien having guided the official nationalist movement into endorsement of a new policy of conciliation. He followed this by campaigning vigorously for the greatest piece of social legislation Ireland had yet seen, orchestrating the Wyndham Land Purchase Act (1903) through Parliament. The Act provided <b>very</b> <b>generous</b> bonus subsidy terms to landowners on sale.|$|E
25|$|Meyer {{was very}} up front {{throughout}} his life about being too selfish {{to be a father}} or even a caring partner or husband. Yet he is also said to have been <b>very</b> <b>generous</b> with all his friends and acquaintances, and never isolated friends from one another. Biographers have attributed most of his brutish and eccentric nature {{to the fact that he}} was abandoned by his father, an Oakland police officer and overly coddled by his mother, Lydia, who was married six times. Meyer had a half sister, Lucinda, who was diagnosed in her 20s with paranoid schizophrenia and was committed to California State mental institutions until her death in 1999. Mental illness ran in his family and was something he secretly feared. During his entire life Russ Meyer spoke with only the highest reverence for his mother and sister.|$|E
25|$|There was no {{shortage}} of people willing to come to Texas. The United States was still struggling with {{the aftermath of the}} Panic of 1819, and soaring land prices within the United States made the Mexican land policy seem <b>very</b> <b>generous.</b> In 1827 Austin received a second grant allowing him to settle 100families along the Old San Antonio Road to Nacogdoches, near what is now Bastrop. The location was chosen {{at the behest of the}} Tejanos, who hoped that colonists in that area could help defend against Comanche raids. Austin was later granted permission to resettle 800other families in Texas. Twenty-three other empresarios also brought immigrants to Texas. Of these, only one of the empresarios, Martín De León settled citizens from within Mexico; the others came primarily from the United States. Many of the Anglo settlers owned slaves. All colonists were expected to become naturalized Mexican citizens, and they were also supposed to follow the state religion. In Austin's colony, the local priest formally converted new arrivals but then allowed them to worship as they pleased.|$|E

50|$|Anne and Henri Jules had ten children. Henri Jules, who {{suffered}} from clinical lycanthropy, was greatly supported by his wife. Anne is described as <b>very</b> pious, <b>generous,</b> and charitable, and was praised by many at court for her very supportive nature towards her husband. Despite that her husband, who was prone to great rages, would often beat his quiet wife, even {{in the presence of}} other courtiers. Of her many children, five survived infancy. Four of those went on to marry.|$|R

25|$|The 'Reed' {{company name}} {{continued}} {{into the twentieth century}} long after Charles Reed's death, though under the proprietorship of Stephenson Blake & Co. who had bought Reed's business interests. At one time Reed's had been the larger of the two firms but it had difficulties in financing a modernisation programme as typography changed, and its once valuable equipment became out of date. Indeed, Stephenson Blake's acquisition was thought at the time to be <b>very</b> <b>generous</b> as it looked to be buying little other than the Reed's name and reputation. Not long after, however, thorough cataloguing of Reed's typefaces proved to be a treasure trove. Designs such as the Clarendon typeface, which Charles Reed had originally acquired from Robert Besley & Sons of the Fann Street foundry, became very marketable once re-cast using new technology. Several of Reed's typefaces are now available for use in font collections on our computers, such as Clarendon, which is now owned by a German company (as a trademark of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG licensed through Linotype Library GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG).|$|E
25|$|Ray {{tends to}} be rather lucky, {{acquiring}} money {{in a variety of}} ways, including a record contract with Sony (after selling his soul to the devil for a piano that grants the buyer musical genius), an auspicious eBay purchase of vintage erotica valued at 600 million dollars, and various business ventures. Ray is Founder, President and CEO of Prime Time Records, which releases mostly rap music. Through eBay Platinum Reserve, he now owns Airwolf, Keith Moon's head, and the world's biggest laser. He enjoys throwing lavish parties with unusual themes. Ray drives a Cadillac Escalade. He is <b>very</b> <b>generous</b> to his friends and to people in general, but on an entirely random basis and interspersed with long periods of outright rudeness and total insensitivity. He also has a very serious obsession with Ketel One and Zinfandel alcohols. Although Ray personally obtained his musical skills from a deal with the devil, there has been at least one other musical genius in his lineage: his paternal grandfather Antonyne Cheops Smuckles, better known as the legendary bluesman Rustmouth Chafings.|$|E
