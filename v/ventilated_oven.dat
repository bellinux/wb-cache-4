The determination of thermal and flow {{conditions in the}} oven and, consequently, the windshield temperature distribution is necessary both for the productive process optimisation and to assure beforehand, without any iterative tuning process, the required characteristics of the product considered. To this purpose, the authors carried out a 3 D numerical simulation of the thermal interaction between the glass and the oven internal surfaces during the whole heating process inside the oven. In particular, a finite volumes method was used {{to take into account}} both the convective, conductive and radiative heat transfer in the oven. The numerical temperature distribution in the glass was validated through the comparison with the data obtained from an experimental apparatus designed and built for the purpose. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The autoretardant branch can be analysed in a quantitative way, while the integration of the non-linear autocatalytic branch is allowed in some cases, characterised by the decrease of pH and/or emission of acid volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

The behavior of the different oxidates during artificial maturation is characterized by two distinct stages: oxygen removal (250 - 300 -degrees-C) and hydrocarbon production (300 - 450 -degrees-C).

Beside their emergency as food, these edible wild plants have a great historical and cultural heritage that needs to be well known, preserved and recovered having a real function for improving agro-biodiversity as new vegetable crop species. Prickly goldenfleece [Urospermum picroides (L.) F. W. Schmidt] is an alimurgic plant, growing spontaneously in Southern Italy, of which the basal leaves of the young plants are used as food, fresh or previously cooked in many different dishes. Botanically, prickly goldenfleece is an annual plant, belonging to the Asteraceae family. Young leaves, variously shaped and, often, presenting lobes having sharp-toothed margins are green with pale purple veins. Flower heads produce infructescences with many achenes insides, which are tipped with a pappus of bristles. This paper reports the first results of a study on achenes observations and attempts for the characterization of the young prickly goldenfleece plants as a leaf vegetable crop. In particular, in 2011 summer wild prickly goldenfleece mature infructescences samples were collected in open field in Putignano area (Apulia Region, Southern Italy).

Banana {{is probably}} the most popular fruit all over the world. This popularity is associated with its high nutritional value and the low cost. Even though, the fast maturation of the fruit is a limiting factor for consumption. The enzymatic browning is also a limiting factor.

The objective of this study was to evaluate, in outdoor colony rearing system, the effect of group size on meat quality of a slow growing local rabbit population. The rabbits were weaned at 35 days and housed with conventional system. At 56 ± 3 days old, 84 rabbits were selected and divided into three groups at random. The groups were transferred outdoor in a wooded area and housed in wire net floor colony cages. Each colony cages measured 100 x 150 x 76 h cm. Three different groups size (three replications) were studied: 4 animals/ cage (T 4), 8 animals/cage (T 8), 16 animals/cage (T 16) with a stocking density of 5 animals/m 2. The rabbits were fed a complete feed and alfa-alfa hay ad libitum. At 103 ± 3 days, 12 animals for each group were slaughtered according to WRSA Commission. After 24 hours the loin region and the right hind leg were excised from each carcass and analyzed for assessment meat quality. The pHu was de- termined in situ on the right Longissimus lumborum muscle at the level of the 5 th lumbar vertebra and on the Biceps femoris muscle. Instrumental meat colour expressed as L* (Lightness), a* (redness), b* (yellowness) according to CIELab system was measured with a Minolta CR 300 apparatus with a light source D 65 on a transversal section of Longissimus lumborum muscle and on the Biceps femoris muscle surface. Water holding capacity was measured on 6 samples of Longissimus lumborum muscle for each group, as cooking loss after cooking in a <b>ventilated</b> <b>oven</b> and in water-bath. The meat quality parameters were analyzed by ANOVA. In T 16 group the meat from Longissimus lumborum and Bi- ceps femoris showed significantly higher pHu values than in T 8 and T 4 groups (5. 76 vs. 5. 58 and 5. 56; 5. 85 vs. 5. 69 and 5. 70, respectively; P< 0. 01) : it might be possible that, as a consequence of a greater locomotory activity during rearing period and during capture for the slaughtering, muscular glycogen decreased and meat acidification was modified. Moreover the lower pHu of T 4 and T 8 groups could be related to more favourable welfare rearing conditions that reduced the stress. For Longissimus lumborum colour traits and water holding capacity were not significantly affected by group size; for Biceps femoris T 16 group showed greater L* values than T 8 and T 4 groups (55. 16 vs. 52. 49 and 53. 75; P< 0. 01). In conclusion, considering that the T 4 group obtained good performances in a shorter reared period and showed the lack of aggressiveness than the others groups, as reported in previous paper, it is possible to recommend for outdoor rabbit production the lower group size to assure the animal welfare and the good quality of products. Moreover, it is necessary to underline that the higher value of pHu observed in the meat derived from T 16 group could modify the product quality during storage and for this reason T 4 and T 8 group size are more advisable...|$|E

The FS were submitted to thermal treatment at different temperatures for 45 minutes. Films were dried in <b>ventilated</b> <b>oven</b> at 37 oC/ 18 hr, conditioned at 75 % of relative humidity at 25 oC/ 48 hr before analysis of: mechanical properties by puncture test; apparent opacity by spectrophotometer; solubility by immersion in water; and water vapor permeability by the gravimetric method. In general, films showed good appearance, translucent, easily handled and touchable, except for the films formed with pH 2. 5 and at a low temperature (35 oC), with a medium thickness of 0. 400 ± 0. 005 mm. The pH of the FS significantly affected all the physical properties under study. The temperature of the thermal treatment of the FS greatly affected the force at the rupture, solubility and water vapor permeability. This treatment can promote intermolecular interactions through the formation of disulphide bonds; however a very intense treatment can reverse this effect by irreversible structural alterations in the proteins. The glycerol concentration affected considerably all the properties under study, {{with the exception of the}} apparent opacity. Plasticizer increases the mobility of macromolecules with consequences in all physical properties. As proteínas miofibrilares têm excelentes propriedades filmogênicas. O objetivo deste artigo foi o estudo do efeito do tratamento térmico, do pH e da concentração de plastificante (Cp) da solução filmogênica (SF) a base de proteínas miofibrilares liofilizadas (PML) extraídas de músculo bovino empregando-se a técnica de solubilização por soluções salinas diluídas, sobre algumas propriedades físicas dos filmes comestíveis, utilizando-se uma metodologia de superfície e resposta (MSR). Os filmes foram elaborados a partir de SF contendo 1 g de PML/ 100 g de SF, e de Cp- 50 a 75 g de glicerol/ 100 g de PML. A PML era dispersa em água sob agitação moderada, e o pH era mantido entre 2, 5 - 3, 5 com o emprego de ácido acético. As SF foram submetidas a tratamentos térmicos em diferentes temperaturas (35 - 75 ºC), por 45 minutos. Os filmes foram secos em estufa com circulação forçada de ar a 37 ºC/ 18 h, condicionados em 75 % de umidade relativa, a 25 ºC/ 48 h, antes da realização de análises: propriedades mecânicas - teste de perfuração; opacidade aparente por espectrofotometria; solubilidade, por imersão em água; e permeabilidade ao vapor de água, pelo método gravimétrico. Em geral, os filmes se apresentaram com boa aparência, translúcidos, de fácil manuseio e tátil, exceto para os filmes formados em pH 2, 5 e em temperatura (35 ºC), com espessura média de 0, 040 ± 0, 005 mm. O pH da SF afetou significativamente todas as propriedades físicas estudadas. A temperatura do tratamento térmico da SF afetou significativamente a força na ruptura, solubilidade e a permeabilidade ao vapor de água (Pva). Esse tratamento pode favorecer as interações intermoleculares via formação de pontes dissulfídicas, mas um tratamento muito intenso pode reverter esse efeito por alterações estruturais irreversíveis nas proteínas. A Cp afetou significativamente todas as propriedades estudadas, com exceção da opacidade aparente. O plastificante aumenta a mobilidade das macromoléculas, reduzindo suas interações, com conseqüências em todas as propriedades físicas...|$|E
