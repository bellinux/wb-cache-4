5|$|RNA {{interference}} is also {{a promising}} way to treat cancers by silencing genes differentially upregulated in tumor cells or genes involved in cell division. A key area {{of research in the}} use of RNAi for clinical applications is the development of a safe delivery method, which to date has involved mainly <b>viral</b> <b>vector</b> systems similar to those suggested for gene therapy.|$|E
5|$|Gene therapy {{typically}} {{involves the}} use of a non-infectious virus (i.e., a <b>viral</b> <b>vector</b> such as the adeno-associated virus) to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an enzyme that helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage. In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD. There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown. One of these reported positive results in 2011, but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012.|$|E
5|$|Methods {{have been}} {{developed}} to purify DNA from organisms, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction. Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant DNA is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They can be transformed into organisms in the form of plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a <b>viral</b> <b>vector.</b> The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins, used in medical research, or be grown in agriculture.|$|E

25|$|Conversely, replication-competent viral vectors contain all {{necessary}} genes for virion synthesis, {{and continue to}} propagate themselves once infection occurs. Because the viral genome for these vectors is much lengthier, {{the length of the}} actual inserted gene of interest is limited compared to the possible length of the insert for replication-defective vectors. Depending on the <b>viral</b> <b>vector,</b> the typical maximum length of an allowable DNA insert in a replication-defective <b>viral</b> <b>vector</b> is usually about 8–10 kB. While this limits the introduction of many genomic sequences, most cDNA sequences can still be accommodated.|$|E

25|$|Identification: Viral vectors {{are often}} given certain genes that help {{identify}} which cells {{took up the}} viral genes. These genes are called Markers. A common marker is antibiotic resistance to a certain antibiotic.

25|$|Sickle-cell {{disease can}} be treated in mice. The mice – which have {{essentially}} the same defect that causes human cases – used a <b>viral</b> <b>vector</b> to induce production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which normally ceases to be produced shortly after birth.

40|$|Two {{mammalian}} introns, {{the human}} growth hormone intron and the Simian virus 40 large T antigen intron, were inserted into the coding sequences of diphtheria toxin fragment A (DT-A) and barnase (Bar), respectively, to disrupt their open-reading frames (ORFs). Expression of these two toxic proteins were totally abolished, which enabled the production of normal levels of recombinant baculoviral and adeno-associated <b>viral</b> (AAV) <b>vectors</b> in insect cells. When these <b>viral</b> <b>vectors</b> were introduced into mammalian cells, the introns were spliced out and the toxic proteins were expressed, which resulted in apoptosis in mammalian cells. This is the first report to show that <b>viral</b> <b>vectors</b> harboring toxin genes can be produced at normal levels by exploiting the intron-splicing mechanism of insect cells. Furthermore, <b>viral</b> <b>vectors</b> carrying the DT-A gene under control of tumor-specific promoters were able to exert tumor-specific cell killing.

25|$|In 2001 it was {{reported}} that sickle-cell disease had been successfully treated in mice using gene therapy. The researchers used a <b>viral</b> <b>vector</b> to make the mice—which have essentially the same defect that causes human sickle cell disease—express production of fetal haemoglobin (HbF), which an individual normally ceases to produce shortly after birth. In humans, using hydroxyurea to stimulate the production of HbF has been known to temporarily alleviate sickle cell disease symptoms. The researchers demonstrated that this gene therapy method is a more permanent way to increase therapeutic HbF production.|$|E
25|$|Viral vectors are {{generally}} genetically engineered viruses carrying modified viral DNA or RNA {{that has been}} rendered noninfectious, but still contain viral promoters and also the transgene, thus allowing for translation of the transgene through a viral promoter. However, because viral vectors frequently are lacking infectious sequences, they require helper viruses or packaging lines for large-scale transfection. Viral vectors are often designed for permanent incorporation of the insert into the host genome, and thus leave distinct genetic markers in the host genome after incorporating the transgene. For example, retroviruses leave a characteristic retroviral integration pattern after insertion that is detectable and indicates that the <b>viral</b> <b>vector</b> has incorporated into the host genome.|$|E
25|$|In September it was {{announced}} that an 18-year-old male patient in France with beta-thalassemia major had been successfully treated. Beta-thalassemia major is an inherited blood disease in which beta haemoglobin is missing and patients are dependent on regular lifelong blood transfusions. The technique used a lentiviral vector to transduce the human ß-globin gene into purified blood and marrow cells obtained from the patient in June 2007. The patient's haemoglobin levels were stable at 9 to 10 g/dL. About a third of the hemoglobin contained the form introduced by the <b>viral</b> <b>vector</b> and blood transfusions were not needed. Further clinical trials were planned. Bone marrow transplants are the only cure for thalassemia, but 75% of patients do not find a matching donor.|$|E
40|$|Recombinant <b>viral</b> <b>vectors</b> such as {{adenovirus}} and adenovirus-associated virus {{have been}} used widely as vehicles for gene therapy applications {{because of the high}} efficiency with which they transfer genes into a wide spectrum of cells in vivo. However, enthusiasm for the use of <b>viral</b> <b>vectors</b> in gene therapy has been tempered by significant problems of attendant host cellular and humoral immune responses that limit their safety and efficacy in vivo. Advances in immunology have suggested a crucial role for the innate immune system in the induction of immune responses to viruses. Thus, {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms by which the host's innate immune system recognizes viruses and <b>viral</b> <b>vectors</b> will help in the design of effective strategies to improve the outcome of viral vector-mediated gene therapy.

2500|$|The {{choice of}} a <b>viral</b> <b>vector</b> to deliver genetic {{material}} to cells comes with some logistical problems. There are {{a limited number of}} viral vectors available for therapeutic use. [...] Any of these few viral vectors can cause the body to develop an immune response if the vector is seen as a foreign invader. Once used, the <b>viral</b> <b>vector</b> cannot be effectively used in the patient again because it will be recognized by the body. If the vaccine or gene therapy fails in clinical trials, the virus can’t be used again in the patient for a different vaccine or gene therapy in the future. Pre-existing immunity against the <b>viral</b> <b>vector</b> could also be present in the patient rendering the therapy ineffective for that patient. It is possible to counteract pre-existing immunity when using a <b>viral</b> <b>vector</b> for vaccination by priming with a non-viral DNA vaccine, but this method presents another expense and obstacle in the vaccine distribution process. Pre-existing immunity may also be challenged by increasing vaccine dose or changing the vaccination route. Some shortcomings of viral vectors (such as genotoxicity and low transgenic expression) can be overcome through the use of [...] hybrid vectors.|$|E
