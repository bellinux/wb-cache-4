5|$|A French fry <b>vending</b> {{machine is}} a <b>vending</b> machine that {{dispenses}} hot French fries, {{also known as}} chips. The first known french fry <b>vending</b> machine was developed circa 1982 by the defunct Precision Fry Foods Pty Ltd. in Australia.

The machine had a feature that automatically turned it off {{in the event of}} a malfunction, and it also had a fire extinguisher built into it.|$|E

In 2016, <b>Vend’s</b> Solutions team gained world-wide notoriety in technology and security circles after detecting and disclosing a major security Internet vulnerability, unrelated to the <b>Vend</b> platform.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s Sokolov joined {{a group of}} geologists tasked with the {{analysis}} of recent deep boring samples.

2500|$|The Coal <b>Vend</b> was {{the only}} cartel prosecuted under the Australian Industries Preservation Act. There was little {{interest}} or impact in promoting competitive markets until the late 1960s. [...] The members of the Coal <b>Vend</b> had successfully resisted each of the prosecutions against them. Its role in raising pries and restricting production was challenged by {{a drop in the}} demand for coal such that it collapsed as a cartel by 1912. The Coal <b>Vend</b> continued to exist through to at least 1929, with the Campbell Royal Commission in 1919 finding that that it had ceased to operate outside the law, and the Davidson Royal Commission in 1929 confirmed the continued existence of the Coal <b>Vend,</b> although again there was no suggestion of it operating illegally.|$|R
