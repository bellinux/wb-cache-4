40|$|Wake fields excited {{in a small}} gap of {{a vacuum}} chamber by ampere beams can have enough {{amplitude}} to heat the chamber. The electric component of these fields can be above the arcing limit. Usually flange connections in a vacuum chamber contain a vacuum gasket and an inner RF gasket. If a small gap occurs between the RF gasket and flange surface, wake fields can heat the flanges. The flanges are usually made of stainless steel, which efficiently absorbs RF power. Some flanges consist of two parts (like a vacuum <b>valve</b> <b>flange)</b> and are mechanically connected but have poor thermal contact. A temperature rise can lengthen the inner part of the flange and make firmer the thermal contact to the outer part of the flange. The heat will then flow to the outer part of the flange, which is air and water-cooled. This cooling lowers the flange temperature and the thermal contact becomes poor again. This “quasi ” periodic mechanism can explain the nature of temperature oscillations observed at several locations in PEP-II, the SLAC B-factory...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. {{natural gas}} {{transmission}} network {{contains more than}} 279, 000 pipeline miles. Along this network, compressor stations {{are one of the}} largest sources of fugitive emissions, producing an estimated 50. 7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of methane emissions annually from leaking compressors and other equipment components such as <b>valves,</b> <b>flanges,</b> connections, and open-ended lines. Data collected from Natural Gas STAR partners demonstrates that 95 percent of these methane emissions are from 20 percent of the leaky components at compressor stations. Implementing a directed inspection and maintenance (DI&M) program is a proven, cost-effective way to detect, measure, prioritize, and repair equipment leaks to reduce methane emissions. A DI&M program begins with a baseline survey to identify and quantify leaks. Repairs that are cost-effective to fix are then made to the leaking components. Subsequent surveys are based on data from previous surveys, allowing operators to concentrate on the components that are most likely to leak and are profitable to repair. Baseline surveys of Natural Gas STAR partners' transmission compressor stations found that the majority of fugitive methane emissions are from {{a relatively small number of}} leaking components. Natural Gas STAR transmission partners have reported significant savings and methane emissions reductions by implementing DI&M.

50|$|Garlock {{is a large}} {{manufacturer}} of gaskets that contain chrysotile asbestos. Garlock stamps its name prominently on its products making it famous among the workers who install and replace its gaskets. Garlock's gaskets were installed in pipes, <b>valves,</b> and <b>flanges</b> which were in turn covered in heavy fire-retardant insulation that also contained asbestos but was manufactured by other parties. The asbestos contained by Garlock products is encased in a polymer-like substance. Garlock products only emit asbestos fibers when cut or struck heavily, usually during removal. Removing such gaskets would necessarily require first removing the insulation covering them which would also release asbestos. The chrysotile asbestos used in Garlock's gaskets is roughly 1/100 to 1/2000 as carcinogenic as the friable amphibole asbestos used in the insulating tape just mentioned.

40|$|Hydrocarbon gas leaks create {{potential}} dangerous situations {{with major}} accidents representing worst case scenarios. Smaller gas leaks are also unwanted as they represent risk of escalation and {{often lead to}} shut down or reduced production. Small gas leaks also represent in total {{a significant amount of}} gas which is detrimental to our atmosphere. Gassco supplies about 20 % of the natural gas consumed in Europe. Economic loss is a direct consequence initiated by shutdown or reduced production, as well as reliance regarding deliveries towards gas customers. The natural gas industry continuously invests considerable resources into prevention of gas leaks. Regarding the subject of hydrocarbon leaks, there exists an abundance of information, reports, procedures and suggestions. There is not always coherence between the available information so the essential for any operator in the industry is to select the relevant, and most important, information to ensure a safe operation. The discussion in this report has shown the complexity of hydrocarbon gas leaks. There are technical, human, and organizational factors contributing to the undesirable risk of gas leaks within the Gassco operatorship. Certain technical components more prone to leak are <b>valves,</b> <b>flanges,</b> gaskets, and heat exchangers. It is therefore important to ensure joint integrity on the facilitation and the execution level. Approximately 20 % of technical leak sources are due to technical degrading. Corrosion under insulation (CUI) has been introduced as an integrity challenge in this area. In order to improve integrity of process facilities it is necessary for Gassco to invest in measures to improve or reduce technical degrading, such as continuous programs for monitoring, inspection and maintenance. As the human factor is underlying cause of the majority of gas leaks the main focus area for Gassco is to get an overview of organizational factors creating risk. Within this area of concern there should be an increased investment in exchange of experience with more frequent workshops as a proposed measure. Reducing risk of possible misinterpretations of governing documents should also be assessed. Within gas detection there are some methods with distinct characteristics. Infrared technology enables visualization of fugitive emissions and continuous monitoring. The handheld gas camera FLIR GD 320 is an efficient method of inspection. The stationary Gas Vision System appears to have potential to become an essential part of monitoring process facilities. Based on the discussion in this report it becomes natural to conclude that the most important safety barrier within the natural gas industry is the human factor. There has been an increased focus on the human factor in recent years with positive results of improvement. However, the industry aims at continuing the positive trend...|$|R

A major task of the Phase- 1 commissioning was the vacuum scrubbing of new beam pipes in anticipation of a sufficiently long beam lifetime and low background noise in the next commissioning, prior to which a new particle detector will be installed. The pressure rise per unit beam current decreased steadily with increasing beam dose, as expected. Another important task was to check the stabilities of various new vacuum components at high beam currents of approximately 1  A. The temperature increases of the bellows chambers, gate <b>valves,</b> connection <b>flanges,</b> and so on were less than several degrees at 1  A, and no serious problems were found.

The use of permanent magnets to create an axial magnetic field of approximately 100  G successfully suppressed this effect.

Currently hydrogen is the prime fuel of today's space vehicles (e. g., Space Shuttle) and featured as a fuel for some prototype vehicles such as the BMW seven series model. Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless gas with a 4 % lower explosive limit which makes leak detection a priority.
