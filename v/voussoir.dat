Its facade features stone quoins, splayed <b>voussoir</b> lintels on the one-over-one double-hung sash, and a wooden bracketed cornice.|$|E
25|$|In 1796 {{a bridge}} he {{designed}} was erected over {{the mouth of}} the Wear River at Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, England. This bridge, the Sunderland arch, was after the same design as his Schuylkill River Bridge in Philadelphia and it became the prototype for many subsequent <b>voussoir</b> arches made in iron and steel. In addition to receiving a British patent for the single-span iron bridge, Paine developed a smokeless candle, and worked with inventor John Fitch in developing steam engines.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea was}} {{expanded}} in Charles Fox's 1836 publication On the Construction of Skew Arches, {{in which he}} considered the intrados of the barrel and the extrados as separate surfaces mapped onto concentric cylinders by drawing a separate development for each. This approach had two advantages. Firstly, {{he was able to}} develop a theoretical third, intermediate surface midway between the intrados and the extrados, which allowed him to align the centre of each <b>voussoir,</b> rather than its inner surface, along the desired line, thereby better approximating the ideal placement than Nicholson was able to achieve.|$|E

25|$|Unlike <b>voussoir</b> arches, {{which require}} support for each element until the {{keystone}} is in place, domes are stable during construction as each level is made {{a complete and}} self-supporting ring. The upper portion of a masonry dome is always in compression and is supported laterally, so it does not collapse except as a whole unit {{and a range of}} deviations from the ideal in this shallow upper cap are equally stable. Because <b>voussoir</b> domes have lateral support, they can be made much thinner than corresponding arches of the same span. For example, a hemispherical dome can be 2.5 times thinner than a semicircular arch, and a dome with the profile of an equilateral arch can be thinner still. The optimal shape for a masonry dome of equal thickness is a revolved catenary curve, similar to the curve of a parabola. This shape provides for perfect compression, with none of the tension or bending forces that masonry is weak against. The pointed profiles of many Gothic domes more closely approximate this optimal shape than do hemispheres, which were favored by Roman and Byzantine architects due to the circle being considered the most perfect of forms. Adding a weight {{to the top of the}} pointed dome, such as the heavy cupola at the top of Florence Cathedral, changes the optimal shape to perfectly match the actual pointed shape of the dome.|$|E
25|$|Nicholson never {{pretended to}} have invented the skew arch {{but in his}} later work The Guide to Railway Masonry, {{containing}} a Complete Treatise on the Oblique Arch (1839), he does claim to have invented the method for producing the templates that enabled the accurate cutting of the <b>voussoir</b> stones used in all skew bridges built between the years 1828 and 1836, citing testimonials from the builders of major works, such as the Croft Viaduct at Croft-on-Tees near Darlington. However, by 1836 a young engineer called Charles Fox had improved on Nicholson's helicoidal method and other writers were proposing alternative approaches to the problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} kind of vault is {{the barrel}} vault (also called a wagon or tunnel vault), {{which is generally}} semicircular in shape. The barrel vault is a continuous arch, the length being greater than its diameter. As in building an arch, a temporary support is needed while rings of voussoirs are constructed and the rings placed in position. Until the topmost <b>voussoir,</b> the keystone, is positioned, the vault is not self-supporting. Where timber is easily obtained, this temporary support is provided by centering consisting of a framed truss with a semicircular or segmental head, which supports the voussoirs until the ring of the whole arch is completed. With a barrel vault, the centering can then be shifted on to support the next rings.|$|E

60|$|If {{still it}} be not strong enough, a farther {{addition}} may be made, as at c, now thickening the <b>voussoirs</b> {{a little at}} the base also. But as this may perhaps throw the arch inconveniently high, or occasion a waste of <b>voussoirs</b> at the top, we may employ another expedient.|$|R
5000|$|The facade is {{asymmetrical}} {{with the}} church's principal door {{leading into the}} base of a single tower. The door has a semicircular arch of radiating stone <b>voussoirs.</b> Central to the facade are a pair of windows topped by horizontal stone lintels. A decorative feature of the facade is the large arch of <b>voussoirs</b> which rises above the windows. In the gable is an ocular ventilation opening framed by <b>voussoirs</b> and set with louvres. The tower rises to a stone course {{at the height of the}} gable, above which is a louvred chamber with a [...] "candle-snuffer" [...] roof.|$|R
25|$|A {{characteristic}} of the regular arch is that the courses of stones run parallel to the abutments and perpendicular to the faces. In an oblique arch these two conditions can not both be met because the faces and the abutments are deliberately not perpendicular. Since skew angles greater than about 15° are required for many applications mathematicians and engineers, such as Chapman, abandoned the idea of laying the courses of stones parallel to the abutments and considered the alternative of laying the courses perpendicular to {{the faces of the}} arch, and accepting the fact that they would then no longer run parallel to the abutments. Though Outram's Store Street Aqueduct was constructed with this principle in mind it was done so empirically, with the masons cutting each <b>voussoir</b> stone as it was required, and it was not until 1828 that details of the technique were published in a form that was useful to other engineers and stonemasons.|$|E
25|$|Nicholson {{approached}} {{the problem by}} constructing a development of the intrados of the arch from the plan and elevation drawings, effectively unrolling and flattening the surface, then drawing the courses perpendicular to the faces, adding the header joints perpendicular to the courses, then finally rolling up the development diagram by projecting the detail of the intrados back onto the plan and elevation drawings, a technique also used by others who would later offer alternative solutions to the problem. This method resulted in the courses of stone voussoirs making up {{the barrel of the}} skew arch following parallel helical paths between the abutments, giving the view along the barrel an attractive rifled appearance. Although these courses meet the arch faces at right angles at the crown of the arch, the nearer they are to the springing line the greater their deviation from perpendicularity. Thus Nicholson's method is not the perfect solution, but it is a workable one that has one great advantage over more purist alternatives, namely that since the helical courses run parallel to each other, all the <b>voussoir</b> stones can be cut to the same pattern, the only exceptions being the ring stones, or quoins, where the barrel meets the faces of the arch, each of which is unique but has an identical copy in the other face.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to these, most Roman stone bridges {{were faced with}} ashlar and rested on <b>voussoir</b> arches, a method which is dominant in other vaulted structures in Lycia too. Compared to the massive and tall semicircular-arched bridges that are typical of Roman architecture, the Limyra bridge, with its flat segmented arches, offers a markedly lower and more elongated appearance, so that Wurster and Ganzert offer a [...] "provisional" [...] late dating, approximately {{during the reign of}} emperor Justinian I in the 6thcentury, during which the use of mixed brick and stone is attested in other structures of the region.|$|E

6000|$|... § VII. This moral {{character}} of the arch is called by architects its [...] "Line of Resistance." [...] There {{is a great deal}} of nicety in calculating it with precision, just as there is sometimes in finding out very precisely what is a man's true line of moral conduct; but this, in arch morality and in man morality, is a very simple and easily to be understood principle,--that if either arch or man expose themselves to their special temptations or adverse forces, outside of the <b>voussoirs</b> or proper and appointed armor, both will fall. An arch whose line of resistance is in the middle of its <b>voussoirs</b> is perfectly safe: in proportion as the said line runs near the edge of its <b>voussoirs,</b> the arch is in danger, as the man is who nears temptation; and the moment the line of resistance emerges out of the <b>voussoirs</b> the arch falls.|$|R
500|$|The {{other early}} {{buildings}} were built surrounding a cloister {{to the south}} of the church. The east range incorporated the chapter house and also contained the sacristy, the canons' dormitory and the reredorter. The upper storey of the west range provided living accommodation for the prior and an area where secular visitors could be received. In the lower storey was the undercroft where food and fuel were stored. The south range contained the refectory, and at a distance from the south range stood the kitchen. Evidence of a bell foundry dating from this period was found [...] {{to the north of the}} church. It is likely that this was used for casting a tenor bell. A few moulded stones from this early period were found. These included nine blocks that probably formed part of a corbel table. There were also two beak-head voussoirs; this type of <b>voussoir</b> is rare in Cheshire, and has been found in only one other church in the county.|$|E

Now {{when the}} reader is told that the line of {{resistance}} varies with every change either in place or quantity of the weight above the arch, he will see at once {{that we have no}} chance of arranging arches by their moral characters: we can only take the apparent arch line, or visible direction, as a ground of arrangement. We shall consider the possible or probable forms or contours of arches in the present Chapter, and in the succeeding one the forms of <b>voussoir</b> and other help which may best fortify these visible lines against every temptation to lose their consistency.|$|E
6000|$|... § XXII. In {{the above}} reasonings, the {{inclination}} of the joints of the voussoirs to {{the curves of}} the arch has not been considered. It {{is a question of}} much nicety, and which I have not been able as yet fully to investigate: but the natural idea of the arrangement of these lines (which in round arches are of course perpendicular to the curve) would be that every <b>voussoir</b> should have the lengths of its outer and inner arched surface in the same proportion to each other. Either this actual law, or a close approximation to it, is assuredly enforced in the best Gothic buildings.|$|E

We have {{traced the}} various {{conditions}} of {{treatment in the}} archivolt alone; but, except {{in what has been}} said of the peculiar expression of the voussoirs, we might throughout have spoken in the same terms of the jamb. Even a parallel to the expression of the <b>voussoir</b> may be found in the Lombardic and Norman divisions of the shafts, by zigzags and other transverse ornamentation, which in the end are all swept away by the canaliculated mouldings. Then, in the recesses of these and of the archivolts alike, the niche and statue decoration develops itself; and the vaulted and cavernous apertures are covered with incrustations of fretwork, and with every various application of foliage to their fantastic mouldings.|$|E

6000|$|... § XIV. The shaft, however, rapidly rallies, {{and brings}} {{up its own}} {{peculiar}} decorations to its aid; and the intermediate archivolts receive running or panelled ornaments, also, until we reach the exquisitely rich conditions of our own Norman archivolts, and of the parallel Lombardic designs, such as {{the entrance of the}} Duomo, and of San Fermo, at Verona. This change, however, occupies little time, and takes place principally in doorways, owing to the greater thickness of wall, and depth of archivolt; so that we find the rich shafted succession of ornament, in the doorway and window aperture, associated with the earliest and rudest double archivolt, in the nave arches, at St. Michele of Pavia. The nave arches, therefore, are most usually treated by the chamfer, and the voussoirs are there defeated much sooner than by the shafted arrangements, which they resist, as we saw, in the south by color; and even in the north, though forced out of their own shape, they take that of birds' or monsters' heads, which for some time peck and pinch the rolls of the archivolt to their hearts' content; while the Norman zigzag ornament allies itself with them, each zigzag often restraining itself amicably between the joints of each <b>voussoir</b> in the ruder work, and even in the highly finished arches, distinctly presenting a concentric or sunlike arrangement of lines; so much so, as to prompt the conjecture, above stated, Chap. XX. § XXVI., that all such ornaments were intended to be typical of light issuing from the orb of the arch. I doubt the intention, but acknowledge the resemblance; which perhaps goes far to account for the never-failing delightfulness of this zigzag decoration. The diminution of the zigzag, as it gradually shares the defeat of the <b>voussoir,</b> and is at last overwhelmed by the complicated, railroad-like fluency of the later Gothic mouldings, is to me one of the saddest sights in the drama of architecture.|$|E
6000|$|... § VII. The most usual condition, however, is that {{unity of}} the two members above described, § V., and which may be {{generally}} represented by the archivolt section a, Fig. LXX.; and from this descend a family of Gothic archivolts of the highest importance. For the cornice, thus attached to the arch, suffers exactly the same changes as the level cornice, or capital; receives, in due time, its elaborate ogee profile and leaf ornaments, like Fig. 8 or 9 of Plate XV.; and, when the shaft loses its shape, and is lost in the later Gothic jamb, the archivolt has influence enough to introduce this ogee profile in the jamb also, through the banded impost: and we immediately find ourselves involved in deep successions of ogee mouldings in sides of doors and windows, which {{never would have been}} thought of, but for the obstinate resistance of the classical architrave to the attempts of the <b>voussoir</b> at its degradation or banishment.|$|E
6000|$|... § VI. If the Gothic {{spirit of}} the {{building}} be thoroughly determined, and victorious, the architrave cornice is compelled to relinquish its classical form, and take {{the profile of a}} Gothic cornice or dripstone; while, in other cases, as in much of the Gothic of Verona, it is forced to disappear altogether. But the voussoirs then concede, on the other hand, so much of their dignity as to receive a running ornament of foliage or animals, like a classical frieze, and continuous round the arch. In fact, the contest between the adversaries may be seen running through all the early architecture of Italy: success inclining sometimes to the one, sometimes to the other, and various kinds of truce or reconciliation being effected between them: sometimes merely formal, sometimes honest and affectionate, but with no regular succession in time. The greatest victory of the <b>voussoir</b> is to annihilate the cornice, and receive an ornament of its own outline, and entirely limited by its own joints: and yet this may be seen in the very early apse of Murano.|$|E
