That year, the Lucerne <b>Valley</b> Chamber of Commerce began an effort to have a state highway designated from Lucerne <b>Valley</b> to Yucca <b>Valley</b> along Old Woman Springs Road.

After passing the turnoff to Darwin, SR 190 enters Death <b>Valley</b> National Park and becomes curvier as it heads down into the Panamint <b>Valley.</b> The highway crosses the <b>valley</b> and then turns northeast over Towne Pass and into the northern part of Death <b>Valley</b> at Stovepipe Wells. Within the <b>valley,</b> {{at the intersection}} with North Highway, which leads to Scotty's Castle and Beatty, Nevada, SR 190 turns southeast through Death <b>Valley,</b> which it remains inside until the turnoff to Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America, near the settlement of Furnace Creek. It leaves the <b>valley</b> to the southeast alongside Furnace Creek Wash, where the highway is usually closed at least once a year by flash floods. SR 190 turns east away from the wash at the turnoff to Dante's View, and soon leaves the park, after which it follows a mostly straight alignment to its end at State Route 127 at Death <b>Valley</b> Junction.|$|E

5|$|The path of SR 190 {{east of the}} Panamint Range in Death <b>Valley</b> National Park was {{followed}} in late 1849 and early 1850 by the Death <b>Valley</b> '49ers, a group of '49ers that had left the Old Spanish Trail at Enterprise, Utah {{to look for a}} shortcut to Walker Pass. The pioneers crossed the state line from Nevada near Ash Meadows, following the general route of present SR 190 from Death <b>Valley</b> Junction into Death <b>Valley,</b> which they left to the west into Panamint <b>Valley</b> and then turned south towards present State Route 178.
