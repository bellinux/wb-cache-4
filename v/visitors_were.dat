The exhibition covered several topics related to taiko in the United States, {{such as the}} formation of performance groups, their construction using available materials, and social movements. <b>Visitors</b> <b>were</b> able to play smaller drums.|$|E
5|$|Guillemin's final plaudit came {{as part of}} {{the team}} that played Stade Toulousain in the final of the Championnat de France, and {{finished}} runner-up. Although favourites to win and leading 0–6 at half time, the <b>visitors</b> <b>were</b> narrowly beaten 8–6.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, metal {{detectors}} {{were added to}} the gates and security was doubled after a person was killed in a shooting during a crowded Mother's Day. It happened after two <b>visitors</b> <b>were</b> involved in a fight, apparently over a drug exchange before their visit to the park.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>visitors</b> <b>are</b> from Asia while approximately one-third of <b>visitors</b> <b>are</b> from North America, Europe, and Oceania in 2016.|$|R
50|$|When {{visitors}} first {{arrive at}} the farm, they are given shirts and pants traditionally worn by mahouts. <b>Visitors</b> <b>are</b> {{from all over the}} world, including the United States, Canada, Austria, France, Germany, Puerto Rico, and Singapore. Then, they are asked to sit down and Theerapat gives a talk on the history of domesticating elephants in Thailand, the state of elephants in Thailand today, and why the farm was founded. After the talk, <b>visitors</b> <b>are</b> led to an open area where the elephants <b>are.</b> <b>Visitors</b> <b>are</b> then called over by Theerapat to be paired-up with an elephant. <b>Visitors</b> <b>are</b> paired with elephants based on their personality in order to promote a good relationship between visitors and the elephants they <b>are</b> paired with. <b>Visitors</b> <b>are</b> also helped by the elephant's mahout who makes sure they properly care for and interact with their elephant. Furthermore, when baby elephants are at the farm, <b>visitors</b> <b>are</b> also allowed to interact with them while the babies mothers are nearby.|$|R
25|$|<b>Visitors</b> <b>are</b> cautioned {{to be on}} {{the lookout}} for prairie rattlesnakes, which {{frequent}} the site. <b>Visitors</b> <b>are</b> asked to wear heavy hiking boots, watch small children closely, and keep pets on a leash.|$|R
5|$|In May 2012, {{several hundred}} zoo <b>visitors</b> <b>were</b> forced to seek shelter after {{a family of}} red river hogs escaped from keepers and ran amok. Those who had taken refuge in the monkey house later {{described}} scenes where zoo workers pursued the animals with various equipment including brushes and dart guns. Though the drama lasted over an hour, the adult hogs were recaptured unharmed.|$|E
5|$|It {{was around}} this time that Edinburgh Zoo's now famous Penguin Parade was established. A zookeeper accidentally left a gate to the penguin pool open, and was {{followed}} around the zoo by a train of penguins. <b>Visitors</b> <b>were</b> so delighted with the procession that it became a regular occurrence, and today around {{two thirds of the}} zoo's penguins parade round the park every day.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} was not recorded, {{but it probably}} involved replacing the blood {{with a mixture of}} turpentine and vermilion. The body was then put in an old clock case and stored in the house of Beswick's family physician, Dr Charles White. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a local celebrity, and <b>visitors</b> <b>were</b> allowed to view her at White's house.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, foreign <b>visitors</b> count <b>is</b> 84,368 persons (77.2 percent), while {{domestic}} <b>visitors</b> <b>is</b> 24,853 persons (22.8 percent).|$|R
5000|$|Due to past {{problems}} with vandalism, <b>visitors</b> <b>are</b> no longer granted admission {{inside of the}} cemetery gates. While <b>visitors</b> <b>are</b> still welcome and encouraged to see the site, <b>visitors</b> <b>are</b> asked to observe the cemetery from outside the metal gate, {{where there is a}} historical marker displaying the history of the site. The only exception to this rule is that of family descendants who may need access to a relative's plot.|$|R
50|$|The area {{contains}} many lakes {{and the most}} known is Lake Plav, {{one of the largest}} in this region. The lakes Hrid and <b>Visitor</b> <b>are</b> mountain lakes, and <b>Visitor</b> <b>is</b> noted for its floating island.|$|R
5|$|All public activities, flights, {{and schools}} were either closed or {{canceled}} on Puerto Rico. Eighteen shelters were {{open on the}} eastern part of the island. Also, on Anguilla, residents in the Sandy Ground, Valley Bottom, Welches and Mount Fortune areas were placed under evacuation orders. Shelters were opened throughout the island for those in need of shelter. Schools and government offices were also closed and <b>visitors</b> <b>were</b> told to leave the island.|$|E
5|$|Both {{games against}} Barcelona ended in draws. Despite Giggs, Scholes and Beckham putting the team into a 3–2 lead at Old Trafford, the <b>visitors</b> <b>were</b> awarded a late penalty after Butt was sent off for {{handling}} the ball. Luis Enrique converted {{the ball into}} the net to leave both teams with a point on Matchday One. In the return game on 25 November at the Camp Nou, a fixture that Barça needed to win to avoid elimination, Dwight Yorke's goals put United ahead 3–2, but Barça star Rivaldo equalized and nearly scored again but his effort hit the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|In 1806, poverty forced Lambert to {{put himself}} on {{exhibition}} to raise money. In , he took up residence in London, charging spectators to enter his apartments to meet him. <b>Visitors</b> <b>were</b> impressed by his intelligence and personality, and visiting him became highly fashionable. After some months on public display, Lambert grew tired of exhibiting himself, and in , he returned, wealthy, to Leicester, where he bred sporting dogs and regularly attended sporting events. Between 1806 and 1809, he made a further series of short fundraising tours.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Visitors</b> <b>are</b> {{also taught}} {{to read their}} elephant's behavior. They are told that {{elephants}} who are calm and happy wag their tails and wave their ears back and forth. When talking to an elephant, <b>visitors</b> <b>are</b> told that if the elephant responds, {{it is a good}} sign. To communicate with their elephant, <b>visitors</b> <b>are</b> taught the Thai words boun, which means [...] "open your mouth," [...] and didi, which means [...] "good." [...] Visitors learn these words when they are feeding their elephant right after they have been introduced. When first meeting their elephant, <b>visitors</b> <b>are</b> given a basket of food consisting of sugar cane, tamarind, and bananas to give to their elephant in order to make friends with them. <b>Visitors</b> <b>are</b> also taught that elephants express affection by putting their trunk around them. These are referred to as elephant [...] "kisses." ...|$|R

5|$|On 7 September 1909 two <b>visitors</b> <b>were</b> left {{stranded}} {{at the top}} of {{the tower}} as the final lift car of the night descended without them. The woman and twelve-year-old child were not noticed during the final round of inspection and so, without a way to communicate with anyone on the ground, they spent the night on the tower until 10am the following morning. They did not appear too concerned by the ordeal and left without giving their names to officials.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{was officially}} opened in 2000, {{but has been}} closed for {{renovation}} since at least February 2008. While it was open, <b>visitors</b> <b>were</b> allowed to tour portions of the complex; the Underground City was popular with foreign tourists but remained virtually forgotten by local citizens. Though {{there are many other}} entrances, foreign visitors entered approved sections accessed via a small shop front in Qianmen, south of Tiananmen Square, at 62 West Damochang Street. Tour groups could enter free of charge and without prior permission while individual tourists not part of a group were charged 20 yuan (US$2.40) each.|$|E
5|$|The new Indian River Inlet Bridge {{opened to}} {{southbound}} traffic on January 20, 2012. Delaware Governor Jack Markell, U.S. Senator Tom Carper, and DelDOT Secretary Shailen Bhatt rode {{in the first}} car across the bridge. On January 30, 2012, one northbound lane of the new bridge opened. On May 6, 2012, the Indian River Inlet Bridge was officially dedicated in a public ceremony in which <b>visitors</b> <b>were</b> able to walk across the bridge. All remaining lanes of the four-lane bridge {{as well as its}} pedestrian and bicycle walkway opened that day.|$|E

5|$|A second {{satellite}} studio, Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida, {{opened in}} 1989 with 40 employees. Its offices were {{located within the}} Disney-MGM Studios theme park at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, and <b>visitors</b> <b>were</b> allowed to tour the studio and observe animators at work. That same year, the studio released The Little Mermaid, which became a keystone achievement in Disney's history as its largest critical and commercial success in decades. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, who'd been co-directors on The Great Mouse Detective, The Little Mermaid earned $84 million at the North American box office, a record for the studio. The film was built around a score from Broadway songwriters Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, {{who was also a}} co-producer and story consultant on the film. The Little Mermaid won two Academy Awards, for Best Original Song and for Best Original Score.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time castles were {{becoming}} tourist attractions for the first time. By the 1740s Windsor Castle had become an early tourist attraction; wealthier visitors who could afford to pay the castle keeper could enter, see curiosities such as the castle's narwhal horn, and by the 1750s buy the first guidebooks. The first guidebook to Kenilworth Castle followed in 1777 with many later editions following in the coming decades. By the 1780s and 1790s <b>visitors</b> <b>were</b> beginning to progress as far as Chepstow, where an attractive female guide escorted tourists around the ruins {{as part of the}} popular Wye Tour. In Scotland Blair Castle became a popular attraction on account of its landscaped gardens, as did Stirling Castle with its romantic connections. Caernarfon in North Wales appealed to many visitors, especially artists. Irish castles proved less popular, partially because contemporary tourists regarded the country as being somewhat backward and the ruins therefore failed to provide the necessary romantic contrast with modern life.|$|E
5|$|Dewar {{moved to}} Taranaki in 1910, {{where he played}} his club rugby for Stratford; he captained the team in 1913. He was first {{selected}} for Taranaki that year and continued to represent the club until {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. In 1912, Taranaki, with Dewar in the team, came close to winning the Ranfurly Shield from Auckland, losing 6–5. In front of a 12,000-spectator home crowd, Auckland dominated in the first half, scoring six points through a try and a penalty kick. The second half saw Taranaki's forwards take control for long periods, resulting in a converted try, but despite ongoing attacks, the <b>visitors</b> <b>were</b> unable to add to their score and lost by just one point.|$|E

5|$|For {{the return}} match between NSW and the British Isles on 25 June, each side made four changes. In the opening period, the sides were evenly matched but {{eventually}} the British scored a try in the corner, which was converted, and a second try soon after took them eight points clear. The <b>visitors</b> <b>were</b> up 13–0 at half time after another converted try: the home side had made numerous attacking attempts but had failed to cross the line. The second half started as the first had ended, with NSW dominating, but they failed to score; instead, the British managed to counter-attack to score another converted try. NSW then managed to score a try but Verge failed to convert. The tourists then scored another three tries, one of them converted. With Britain leading 3–29 in the closing minutes, NSW scored a second try; this time Wickham missed the conversion. The final score was 6–29.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{residents}} were stranded in Hatteras following {{the formation of}} the new inlet created by rising waters. Many parts of North Carolina Highway 12 were partially washed or damaged, which slowed recovery efforts and the return of homeowners in the Outer Banks. Sections of the highway were closed to one lane. The ferry between Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island was temporarily closed due to damage after the hurricane, though a small passenger ferry remained available for Hatteras Village residents and emergency workers. People who were not residents were not allowed to be on the Outer Banks for two weeks after the hurricane due to damaged road conditions. When <b>visitors</b> <b>were</b> allowed to return, many ventured to see the new inlet, despite a 1-mile (1.6km) walk from the nearest road.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Flemming Knudson {{was moved}} to head the Royal Greenland fishing concern and current CEO Michael Binzer was hired with a mandate to lead the company towards greater {{commercialisation}} and self-sufficiency under the Qarsoq 2012 ("Arrow 2012") plan. On 13 June, SAS announced its intention to sell its stake in Air Greenland, a move later incorporated into its restructuring programme, but as of 2012 it has not found any buyers. On 1 October, the airline introduced its e-ticket system. Also in 2007, Air Greenland began direct service with Baltimore/Washington International Airport in the United States of America. After sixty American <b>visitors</b> <b>were</b> stranded by a strike of Air Greenland employees and the company refused to make alternate arrangements for their return, ticket sales slumped and the route was closed in March 2008.|$|E
