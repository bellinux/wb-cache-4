He examined the RR Lyrae <b>variables</b> in the clusters (which he assumed were Cepheid <b>variables)</b> and used their period–luminosity relationship for distance estimates. Later, it was found that RR Lyrae <b>variables</b> are fainter than Cepheid <b>variables,</b> which caused Shapley to overestimate the distances of the clusters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{stationary}} {{distribution of the}} number of customers in the infinite-server system with non-Poissonian arrivals is dependent on the form of the service time distribution. In particular, when the interarrival time is a hyperexponential random <b>variable</b> that is more <b>variable</b> than an exponential random <b>variable,</b> the stationary state distribution becomes stochastically less <b>variable,</b> as the service time becomes more <b>variable.</b> On the other hand, when the interarrival time is an Erlang random <b>variable</b> that is less <b>variable</b> than an exponential random <b>variable,</b> the more <b>variable</b> service time yields the more <b>variable</b> stationary state distribution...|$|R

For the boundedness of integral operators in <b>variable</b> function spaces, we recommend [32] and [33]. In [39], Noi gave Fourier multiplier theorems for Besov and Triebel–Lizorkin spaces with <b>variable</b> exponents. Motivated by the mentioned work, we shall present the boundedness of the bilinear pseudodifferential operator associated to bilinear Hörmander classes in Besov and Triebel–Lizorkin spaces with <b>variable</b> exponents. Indeed, by using the embedding properties of the Besov and Triebel–Lizorkin spaces with <b>variable</b> exponents, we shall establish corresponding Leibnitz-type inequalities for the Besov and Triebel–Lizorkin spaces with <b>variable</b> exponents.|$|R
5|$|The 2-satisfiability {{problem is}} to find a truth {{assignment}} to these <b>variables</b> that makes the whole formula true. Such an assignment chooses whether to make each of the <b>variables</b> true or false, so that at least one literal to true in every clause becomes true. For the expression shown above, one possible satisfying assignment is the one that sets all seven of the <b>variables</b> to true. Every clause has at least one non-negated variable, so this assignment satisfies every clause. There are also 15 other ways of setting all the <b>variables</b> so that the formula becomes true. Therefore, the 2-satisfiability instance represented by this expression is satisfiable.|$|E

40|$|Confounding {{of three}} binary-variables {{counterfactual}} model {{is discussed in}} this paper. According to the effect between the control <b>variable</b> and the covariate <b>variable,</b> we investigate three counterfactual models: the control <b>variable</b> is independent of the covariate <b>variable,</b> the control <b>variable</b> has {{the effect on the}} covariate <b>variable</b> and the covariate <b>variable</b> affects the control <b>variable.</b> Using the ancillary information based on conditional independence hypotheses, the sufficient conditions to determine whether the covariate <b>variable</b> is an irrelevant factor or a confounder in each counterfactual model are obtained...|$|R
30|$|In step three, {{mediation}} {{analysis was}} conducted when a predictor <b>variable</b> was correlated to the proposed outcome <b>variable</b> and another dependent <b>variable.</b> Mediation analysis measures {{the significance of the}} indirect effect {{and the extent to which}} the mediator <b>variable</b> accounts for the relationship between the predictor and the outcome <b>variable.</b> Mediation analysis is particularly appropriate to use when (A) the predictor <b>variable</b> is experimentally manipulated and the mediator <b>variable</b> measured and (B) the dynamic change in the predictor <b>variable</b> precedes the dynamic change in the mediator variable; and both precede the outcome <b>variable</b> [23, 26].|$|R
5|$|In {{computer}} science, 2-satisfiability, 2-SAT or just 2SAT is a computational {{problem of}} assigning values to <b>variables,</b> {{each of which}} has two possible values, in order to satisfy a system of constraints on pairs of <b>variables.</b> It is a special case of the general Boolean satisfiability problem, which can involve constraints on more than two <b>variables,</b> and of constraint satisfaction problems, which can allow more than two choices for the value of each variable. But in contrast to those more general problems, which are NP-complete, 2-satisfiability can be solved in polynomial time.|$|E
5|$|Locking {{multiple}} <b>variables</b> using non-atomic locks {{introduces the}} possibility of program deadlock. An atomic lock locks multiple <b>variables</b> all at once. If it cannot lock all of them, it does not lock any of them. If two threads each need to lock the same two <b>variables</b> using non-atomic locks, {{it is possible that}} one thread will lock one of them and the second thread will lock the second variable. In such a case, neither thread can complete, and deadlock results.|$|E
5|$|Perl {{also takes}} {{features}} from shell programming. All <b>variables</b> are marked with leading sigils, which allow <b>variables</b> to be interpolated directly into strings. However, unlike the shell, Perl uses sigils on all accesses to <b>variables,</b> and unlike most other programming languages that use sigils, the sigil doesn't denote {{the type of}} the variable but the type of the expression. So for example, to access a list of values in a hash, the sigil for an array ("@") is used, not the sigil for a hash ("%").|$|E

50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Sobel’s test {{is performed}} {{to determine if}} the relationship between the independent <b>variable</b> and dependent <b>variable</b> has been significantly reduced after inclusion of the mediator <b>variable.</b> In other words, this test assesses whether a mediation effect is significant. It examines the relationship between the independent <b>variable</b> and the dependent <b>variable</b> compared to the relationship between the independent <b>variable</b> and dependent <b>variable</b> including the mediation factor.|$|R

25|$|The {{language}} of second-order arithmetic is two-sorted. The first sort of terms {{and in particular}} <b>variables,</b> usually denoted by lower case letters, consists of individuals, whose intended interpretation is as natural numbers. The other sort of <b>variables,</b> variously called “set variables,” “class variables,” or even “predicates” are usually denoted by upper-case letters. They refer to classes/predicates/properties of individuals, and so {{can be thought of}} as sets of natural numbers. Both individuals and set <b>variables</b> can be quantified universally or existentially. A formula with no bound set <b>variables</b> (that is, no quantifiers over set <b>variables)</b> is called arithmetical. An arithmetical formula may have free set <b>variables</b> and bound individual <b>variables.</b>|$|E

25|$|Principal {{component}} regression (PCR) is {{used when}} the number of predictor <b>variables</b> is large, or when strong correlations exist among the predictor <b>variables.</b> This two-stage procedure first reduces the predictor <b>variables</b> using principal component analysis then uses the reduced <b>variables</b> in an OLS regression fit. While it often works well in practice, there is no general theoretical reason that the most informative linear function of the predictor <b>variables</b> should lie among the dominant principal components of the multivariate distribution of the predictor <b>variables.</b> The partial least squares regression is the extension of the PCR method which does not suffer from the mentioned deficiency.|$|E
25|$|<b>Variables</b> are {{denoted by}} a string {{consisting}} of letters, numbers and underscore characters, and beginning with an upper-case letter or underscore. <b>Variables</b> closely resemble <b>variables</b> in logic {{in that they}} are placeholders for arbitrary terms.|$|E

25|$|Because <b>variables</b> {{conforming}} only to nominal or ordinal measurements {{cannot be}} reasonably measured numerically, {{sometimes they are}} grouped together as categorical <b>variables,</b> whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative <b>variables,</b> which can be either discrete or continuous, due to their numerical nature. Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with data type in computer science, in that dichotomous categorical <b>variables</b> may be represented with the Boolean data type, polytomous categorical <b>variables</b> with arbitrarily assigned integers in the integral data type, and continuous <b>variables</b> with the real data type involving floating point computation. But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented.|$|E
