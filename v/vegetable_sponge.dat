40|$|The use {{of biomass}} as an {{adsorbent}} material follows {{the principles of}} sustainability and Green Chemistry. Given the low cost, high abundance, easy availability and high adsorption capacity of the <b>vegetable</b> <b>sponge</b> (Luffa cylindrica), this study aimed to explore the adsorption process of the toxic metal cadmium (Cd). The parameters evaluated were pH, contact time, adsorption isotherms, thermodynamic parameters, percolation and desorption. The proposed method showed high retention of Cd ions, being 99. 80 % at pH 5. 0 for the percolation method, more effective than with stirring, which had 89. 6 %. It is noteworthy that the <b>vegetable</b> <b>sponge</b> adsorbs significant amounts of Cd {{in the range of}} pH 4. 0 to 6. 0, indicating that is not necessary to adjust pH for most treatments in real samples. The Cd ion is spontaneous and favorably adsorbed by this material, according to the Freundlich isotherm model. According to the obtained results, it is feasible to use <b>vegetable</b> <b>sponge</b> as a material for the remediation of effluents due to high retention of Cd ions...|$|E

40|$|Loofah (Luffa cylindrica) {{is grown}} {{in several states}} of Brazil, but is found more {{frequently}} as spontaneous plant and in small plantings, as in the State of Rio de Janeiro. In different locations in the State of Rio de Janeiro loofah plants were observed exhib-iting symptoms characteristic of diseases caused by phytoplasmas. Symptomatic plants were tested {{for the presence of}} phytoplas-mas, using phytoplasma-specific DNA amplification in PCR. Sequences of 16 S rRNA phytoplasma were amplified in nested PCR primed by P 1 /P 7 and R 16 F 2 n/R 2. PCR assays primed by R 16 (III) F 2 /R 1 yielded an amplified product of approximately 0. 8 kb. The results demonstrated the presence of a phytoplasma associated with loofah witches ’ broom {{for the first time in}} Brazil, and revealed that the phytoplasma is affiliated to 16 SrIII group.

40|$|Surveys from March to August 2005 at lowland {{areas in}} South Sumatera were {{conducted}} to determine parasitoid species attacking Liriomyza sativae in vegetable crops, i. e. long bean (Vigna sinensis), current tomato (Lycopersicum pimpeneliifolium), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), and <b>vegetable</b> <b>sponge</b> (Luffa cylindrica). Leafminer-infested leaves of the host plants were collected every two-week. The laboratory observation was carried out to identify parasitoid species, and to determine the apparent parasitism of L. sativae by those parasitoids. Fourteen species of the hymenopterous parasitoids found in the vegetable crops were Asecodes sp., Chrysonotomyia sp., Diglyphus albiscapus, Diglyphus sp., Diphoropria kushell, Diphoropria sp., Gronotoma sp., Hemiptarsenus varicornis, Neochrysocharis okazakii, Neochrysocharis sp., Opius sp., Quadrasticus liriomyzae, Quadrastichus sp, and a mymarid wasp (an unidentifiable species). In South Sumatera, all the parasitoids except H. varicornis were reported {{for the first time}} parasitizing L. sativae larvae. The apparent parasitism by those parasitoids amounted to 42. 86...|$|E
40|$|The {{frequent}} {{contamination of}} water resources with drugs comprises one the most important environmental problems. In order to avoid serious disturbances for aquatic life, efficient and economically viable procedures should be developed for removing common pollutants, as paracetamol. From these considerations, the present work evaluated the efficiency of sugar cane bagasse (SCB) and <b>vegetable</b> <b>sponge</b> (VS), two natural adsorbents commonly found in Brazil, for retaining paracetamol molecules dispersed in aqueous solutions. Thus, systems composed of glass columns and peristaltic pumps were optimized and, for pH, the best value was 7. 0. After optimisation, adsorption isotherms were built and it was possible to calculate the MAC F values for SCB (120. 5 µg/g) and VS (37. 5 µg/g). Additionally, real matrices of pretreated water, from a municipal plant for water catchment, were enriched with paracetamol at 5 µM and passed through glass columns packed with SCB, VS and activated carbon (AC). The results showed that SCB was more attractive than AC in terms of price and efficiency (60 % against 45 % adsorption, respectively), while VS was responsible for removing 40 % of paracetamol dissolved in the enriched water samples. Thus, the proposed natural adsorbents can be classified as viable materials to remove paracetamol from water used for human consumption...|$|E
40|$|Luffa (Luffa aegyptica Mill syn. L. cylindrica), or Loofah or <b>vegetable</b> <b>sponge,</b> is {{a member}} of the Cucurbitaceae family. Luffa is closely related to and has similar {{cultural}} requirements as the cucumber. It is an annual climbing vine, which produces a fruit containing a fibrous vascular system. When separated from the skin, flesh and seeds, the fiber network can be used as a bathroom sponge. Luffa can also be used as packing material, for making crafts, and as filters. Used as a bath sponge it produces a mild glow on the skin. The blood circulation the sponge induces on the skin has been credited as a relief for rheumatic and arthritic sufferers. The versatility of the luffa goes beyond producing sponges. The young fruit, when small, (around 6 inches) are delicious used in soup or stew. They can also be cooked like summer squash. Older fruit have been reported to develop purgative chemicals. Because luffa has a compact network of close fibers, its resiliency makes it useful for many products like filters, slipper soles, baskets. Small pieces of luffa sponge are good for scraping vegetables like carrots without having to remove the valuable nutrients by peeling them. You can also wash dishes, scrub your tub, etc. with luffa. When they become soiled throw them in the washer! Luffa is environmentally safe, biodegradable and a renewable resource. Growing: Luffa requires a very long growing season in order to mature into dried sponges. Luffa is cold sensitive. Th...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Endodontic {{treatment}} comprises individual {{steps that}} should be effectively performed {{in order to achieve}} therapeutic success. Among these steps is the determination of the real tooth length, which prevents damage to the periapical tissues during instrumentation and obturation, due to restrict the operator action, favoring tissue repair. Objective: The present study aimed to evaluate in vitro the reliability of two electronic apical locators (Root ZX II® and Propex II®) in working length determination, compared to direct visual measurement. Material and methods: Forty single-rooted human teeth were selected; the pulp chamber was accessed and a size 10 Kerr file was inserted into the canal until its tip was visible at the apical foramen with x 8 magnification. At this point, a rubber stop was placed on the file, at the incisal edge, and this length was measured with an endodontic ruler, therefore, recording the real tooth length (RTL). Then, the teeth were embedded in a <b>vegetable</b> <b>sponge</b> (loofah) base, soaked in saline solution. Electronic measurements were carried out using Root ZX II® and Propex II® locators, until an “Apex” reading was observed. The measurements obtained by the different methods were compared. Results: Root ZX II® apical locator showed 93 % of correct readings, while Propex II® locator was correct in 90 % of the measurements. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two apex locators tested (p = 0. 05). Conclusion: Both apex locators showed an acceptable percentage of correct readings and, therefore, may be recommended for clinical use...|$|E
