Here Shunryu studied a <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Zen, one that promoted the attainment of satori through the concentration on koans through zazen. Suzuki had problems sitting with his koan. Meanwhile, all the other boys passed theirs, and he felt isolated. Just before the ceremony marking their departure Suzuki went to the Rinzai teacher and blurted out his answer. The master passed Suzuki; later Shunryu believed {{he had done it}} simply to be kind.|$|E
25|$|A <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> search came to {{prominence}} in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization. For many problems, {{it is possible to}} begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing, beam search and random optimization.|$|E

500|$|The two symphonies are {{strongly}} contrasted with one another. The First is {{on a large}} scale, reminiscent at times of Sibelius. Grove says {{of the work that}} its [...] "orgiastic power, coruscating malice, sensuous desolation and extroverted swagger" [...] make the symphony a tribute to Walton's tenacity and inventive facility. Critics have always differed on whether the finale lives up {{to the rest of the}} work. In comparison with the First, the Second Symphony struck many reviewers as lightweight, and, as with many of Walton's works of the 1950s, it was regarded as old fashioned. It is a <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> work from the First Symphony. David Cox describes it as [...] "more a divertimento than a symphony ... highly personal, unmistakably Walton throughout", and Kennedy calls it [...] "somewhat enigmatic in mood, and a superb example of Walton's more mature, concise, and mellow post-1945 style." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} {{explanations}} of the Greek success. Most scholars believe that the Greeks had better equipment and used superior tactics. According to Herodotus, the Greeks were better equipped. They did not use bronze upper body armour at this time, but that of leather or linen. The phalanx formation proved successful, because the hoplites had a long tradition in hand-to-hand combat, whereas the Persian soldiers were accustomed to a <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> conflict. At Marathon, the Athenians thinned their centre {{in order to make}} their army equal in length to the Persian army, not {{as a result of a}} tactical planning. It seems that the Persian centre tried to return, realizing that their wings had broken, and was caught in the flanks by the victorious Greek wings. Lazenby (1993) [...] believes that the ultimate reason for the Greek success was the courage the Greeks displayed: ...|$|E
500|$|While {{searching for}} investors, Nagy and Berwin {{learned that the}} {{homosexuality}} of the characters was not {{as much of an}} obstacle for securing financing as {{the fact that they were}} women. [...] "Having two women leads was the issue," [...] Nagy noted. In 2015, Berwin said that, in those days, it was a risky idea to play the role of Carol. [...] "As a project it came together with Cate Blanchett. You needed to always start with her role". Film4 Productions and Tessa Ross financed the development of the film and kept it alive throughout the years, as it [...] "underwent a decade-plus of revision under various directors and investors" [...] − including Hettie MacDonald, Kenneth Branagh, Kimberly Peirce, John Maybury, and Stephen Frears − until the project completely stalled. The long trek was a result of the struggles and roadblocks experienced with funding, rights, and trepidations about a film with a gay theme and two female leads. [...] "During its development, there was a <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> lesbian or gay movie that got financed", Nagy said. [...] "They were very agenda or issue driven, and this was not. In fact it insists on not being that in order to make the point.

2500|$|Wilde's {{contemporary}} George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950) was a <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> writer. Born in Dublin, Shaw {{moved to}} London in 1876 intending {{to become a}} novelist. Here he became active in socialist politics and {{became a member of}} the Fabian Society. He was also a very public vegetarian. His writing for the stage was influenced by Henrik Ibsen. His early political plays were not popular, but he made a breakthrough with John Bull's Other Island (1904). Shaw was extremely prolific, and his collected writings filled 36 volumes. Many of his plays are now forgotten, but a number, including Major Barbara, Saint Joan (usually considered his masterpiece) and Pygmalion [...] are still regularly performed. Pygmalion [...] was the basis for the movie My Fair Lady, a fact which benefitted the National Gallery of Ireland as Shaw had left the royalties of the play to the gallery. A statue to the playwright now stands outside the gallery entrance. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1925.|$|E
