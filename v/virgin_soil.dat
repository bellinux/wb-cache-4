40|$|The main {{sources of}} cadmium in soil-plant {{continuum}} in amounts that might present a hazard are liquid and solid wastes of sewage sludge, farm manures and fertilizers. In the southwest of Iran (Khuzestan Province) over 50, 000 ha of land is under sugarcane (Saccarum officinarum) cultivation and more than 80, 000 ha will be under sugarcane {{by the end of}} the year 2000. In these sugarcane fields, about 400 kg ha- 1 diamonium phosphate (DAP) and 400 kg ha- 1 urea are applied annually. There is no data available to show the fertilizers impact on soil, water and plant contaminations in Iran with respect to cadmium. The objective of this research was to compare the extractable cadmium of <b>virgin</b> <b>soils</b> with that of soils under sugarcane.  Four sugarcane growing stations viz. Haft-tapeh, Karoon, Shoeibieh and Ghazali with cultivation histories of 36, 20, 2 and 1 year, respectively, were selected. In each site, along a transect soil samples from 0 - 30 cm of both furrows and ridges of cultivated <b>soils</b> and of <b>virgin</b> <b>soils</b> were collected. Electrical conductivity (EC), pH, clay and organic carbon contents, CI and Cd of 101 soil samples were measured according to standard methods.

25|$|Yet, on the whole, {{it was an}} {{agricultural}} society without skill or resources. It committed all those sins which characterize a wasteful and ignorant husbandry.

Instruments of cultivation were rude and clumsy and only too few, many of them being made on the farm. It is plain why the American frontier settler was on the move continually. It was, not his fear of a too close contact with the comforts and restraints of a civilized society that stirred him into a ceaseless activity, nor merely the chance of selling out at a profit to the coming wave of settlers; it was his wasting land that drove him on.

[...] Since humans have a physical nature, they cannot be saved by a spiritual law. [...] Instead, they need a human Savior. [...] This is why {{it was necessary for}} Christ to take human flesh.

He also was instrumental in developing in Saskatchewan a comprehensive medicare program. His popularity and qualities of administrator and teacher served the U of S well during his presidency. The fourth and youngest Canadian university president, John William Tranter Spinks (1959–74) brought in a whirlwind era for the university. ...enrolment sky rocketed, a new campus was opened, new buildings were erected, new colleges and schools were started and course offerings were increased. This included a comprehensive health care complex, establishment of a Crop Development Centre, a Linear Accelerator Laboratory, SED Systems, an Institute for Northern Studies, and an Indian and Northern Education Program. Robert William Begg (1974–80) became the fifth U of S president, who received the Order of Canada during his term in office for his distinguished career in education and for his contributions to cancer research.

40|$|Introduction: Multiple {{biological}} and physiological {{processes in the}} plant, including carbohydrates and proteins formation, activation of 50 enzymes for energy transmission as well as reducing water losses from leaf pores, are mostly affected {{by the presence of}} potassium in the plant. In order to test this hypothesis, five soil subgroups (TypicCalcixerepts, FluventicHaploxerepts, TypicEndoaquepts, TypicHalaquepts and VerticEndoaquepts) belonging 15 series of gardened and adjoining <b>virgin</b> <b>soils</b> were described and sampled. The studied soils had been influenced under horticultural practices for over five decades. Materials and Methods: The soil samples were analyzed for different K forms, K adsorption and physico- chemical properties after air drying and grinding to pass through a 2 mm-sieve. The particle-size distribution was determined by the hydrometer method (Bouyoucos, 1962). The total carbonate in the soil expressed as the calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) was determined by a rapid titration method (Nelson, 1982). Organic matter (OM) was measuredby the Walkley and Black (1934) dichromate oxidation method. The pH of the soil was analyzed in 2 : 1 CaCl 2 /soil suspension using glass electrode pH meter (Crockford and Norwell, 1956) and EC was detected in a saturated extract. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) was measured using sodium acetate (1 M NaOAc) at pH 8. 2 (Chapman, 1965). Water soluble K was extracted with deionized water (1 : 5 w/v) after shaking for 30 minutes on a mechanical shaker and later contents were centrifuged to separate clear extract (Jackson 1973). Exchangeable K was determined by extracting the soil with neutral normal ammonium acetate, Non-exchangeable K was estimated as the difference between boiling 1 N HNO 3 –K and neutral normal ammonium acetate K (Thomas 1982). Results and Discussion: The result showed that for most of the studied soils, long-terms horticultural practices decreased the amount of different K forms as a result of changes in soils types, agricultural practices and soil properties. In Comparing to the <b>virgin</b> <b>soils,</b> long-term horticultural and irrigation activities caused a decrease?? in soluble K from 0. 05 (a drop of 15...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{solarization}} {{was carried}} out at three eucalyptus forest nurseries in Argentina in order to evaluate an al-ternative method for controlling damping-off of seedlings. The experiments were performed at forest nurseries, located in a temperate climate (province of Buenos Aires), infected with Fusarium (mainly F. oxy-sporum) and Pythium species, using single and double layers of transparent polyethylene film during summer months (January and February). Effectiveness of the treatments was evaluated using a biological assay en-abling assessment of soil inoculum potential. Soil temperatures reached during solarization at the three nurseries were 44, 45 and 49 °C, respectively. The soilborne pathogens were controlled within 4 weeks us-ing {{a single layer in}} one of the nurseries and using a double layer in the two others.

If possible, the minimum or zero agronomic forms of agricultural tillage must be applied in the system of adaptive-landscape agriculture for the restoration and conservation of agronomically valuable soil structure...|$|R

Little information is available on enzyme activities of eroded soils in Bulgaria, especially on their relations to the degree of erosion and soil properties. In this work, slightly, moderately and severely eroded Chromic Luvisols under different land use (pasture, crop field and virgin) were studied. Enzyme activities (invertase, catalase and phosphatase), total nitrogen, total carbon, available phosphorus contents and soil particle distribution were determined and possible relations between them were examined.

In the single metal system, Zn exhibited a greater {{affinity for the}} alkaline soil, {{as indicated by the}} Langmuir constant (KL = 8. 85 L/kg) compared with Cd (KL = 1. 79 L/kg). However, much less sorption of both Zn (KL = 0. 19 L/kg) and Cd (KL = 0. 07 L/kg) was observed in the acidic soil. The competitive sorption data were modeled using two-metal Freundlich and Langmuir functions. The competition for metal sorption occurred in the alkaline soil only at a higher concentration of the competing metals, whereas the effect was significant even at lower concentrations in the acidic soil. The cumulative amount of both metals sorbed in the soil was similar to that of single metal systems in the studied concentration range, demonstrating that the number of sites available for sorption remained constant irrespective of the competition. This study indicated that Cd might be more mobile in a mixed-metal system than in a single-metal scenario and thus poses a serious ecotoxicological threat.

Both soils are characterized by the accumulative type of magnetic susceptibility and F-factor values distribution patterns with depth.

Indeed, the present domestic requirements of the United States are estimated at more than ninety per cent of the average yield of the five years 1909-1913.[5] At that time, however, the tendency towards stringency was showing itself, not so much in a lack of abundance as in a steady increase of real cost. That is to say, taking the world as a whole, there was no deficiency of wheat, but in order to call forth an adequate supply it was necessary to offer a higher real price.
