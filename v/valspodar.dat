40|$|INTRODUCTION: This {{trial was}} {{designed}} to determine the maximum tolerated dose of intravenous daunorubicin (DNR) in combination with <b>valspodar</b> and to test the feasibility of P-glycoprotein modulation using <b>valspodar</b> in elderly patients with previously untreated acute myelogenous leukemia receiving standard induction chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients > or = 60 years of age with previously untreated AML received <b>valspodar</b> (10 mg/kg/ 24 h by continuous intravenous infusion [CIV] on days 1 - 4 with a 2 -mg/kg loading dose on day 1) in conjunction with two cycles of induction chemotherapy consisting of cytarabine (200 mg/m(2) CIV on days 1 - 7), and DNR (35 mg/m(2) [cohort 1] or 45 mg/m(2) [cohort 2] on days 1 - 3, intravenous bolus). Patients were assessed for dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), response rate, event-free and overall survival, and pharmacokinetics of <b>valspodar</b> and DNR. RESULTS: <b>Valspodar</b> was well tolerated at the lower DNR dose level (ie, 35 mg/m(2)) resulting in a 21 % rate of DLT and only three toxic deaths. Treatment-related mortality was unacceptably high at the 45 mg/m(2) DNR dose level. The complete response rate was 49 % overall and similar in both cohorts. The median overall survival of patients was 333 days in cohort 1 compared to 98 days in cohort 2. At baseline, 70 % of assessable patients were P-glycoprotein positive. CONCLUSION: Substantial inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity can be achieved in this patient population at clinically tolerable doses of <b>valspodar</b> and DNR. The maximum tolerated dose of DNR was established as 35 mg/m(2). This regimen is being further evaluated in phase III trials. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Chemotherapy {{of primary}} and {{secondary}} brain tumors is hampered by {{the existence of the}} blood-brain-barrier (BBB) which reduce the brain concentrations of lipophilic cytostatic agents by efflux transport proteins like p-glycoprotein 170 (p-gp). Combining cytostatic agents that are p-gp substrates with inhibitors of p-gp like <b>valspodar</b> is a new approach to overcome the BBB. As a model of non-small cell lung cancer metastases, intracerebral implanted human NCI-H 460 cells were treated with a combination of <b>valspodar</b> and vinblastine (50 mg/kg of <b>valspodar</b> p. o.; 0. 8 mg/kg of vinblastine i. p., every 5 day). Brain metastases of small cell lung cancer were simulated by the intracerebral injection of DMS 114 cells and treated with a combination of <b>valspodar</b> and paclitaxel (50 mg/kg of <b>valspodar</b> p. o.; 3 mg/kg of paclitaxel i. v. on day 8, and 2 mg/kg on day 15). No therapeutic benefit was observed in the intracerebral tumor models despite restoration of chemosensitivity in vitro. The high aggressiveness of NCI-H 460 cells together with the rapid cell proliferation may be the reason for the negative in vivo result. Furthermore, the increase in the vinblastine concentration in the brain, resulting from the p-gp inhibition by <b>valspodar</b> seemed to be extremely low. In case of intracranial DMS 114 tumors chemosensitivity of DMS 114 cells against paclitaxel seemed to be lower compared to the in vitro sensitivity. The 3 rd generation p-gp modulators elacridar and tariquidar were characterized with respect to their activity to inhibit p-gp mediated efflux and their specificity against other ABC proteins present at the BBB like the ABCG 2 transporter. Both compounds showed an up to 80 times higher inhibitory activity against p-gp than <b>valspodar</b> with IC 50 values of 20. 5 nM for elacridar and 26. 5 nM in case of tariquidar. Elacridar and tariquidar are non-specific modulators as both compounds were able to inhibit not only the p-gp mediated efflux but also ABCG 2 transport. However, they differed concerning the selectivity for the two ABC transport proteins. Also, the effect of the two modulators on the paclitaxel distribution in nude mice was examined. The paclitaxel levels were detected in liver, kidney, plasma and brain of nude mice 1. 5, 3, 4. 5 and 24 hours after the intravenous injection of paclitaxel by HPLC. The results were compared to the paclitaxel distribution after co-administration of the 2 nd generation modulator <b>valspodar.</b> In contrast to <b>valspodar,</b> elacridar and tariquidar distribution in the nude mice was determinable. Compared to the IC 50 values for p-gp inhibition determined in vitro, 500 to 2500 times higher elacridar and 100 times higher tariquidar concentrations were detected in the brain samples. Hence, sufficient modulator levels were reached for p-gp modulation at the BBB. In liver and kidney the paclitaxel concentrations were similar in the control, the elacridar and the tariquidar group, whereas in the <b>valspodar</b> group the paclitaxel concentrations were significantly higher. In the plasma of <b>valspodar</b> treated mice the paclitaxel levels were about 10 times higher than in the plasma of mice treated with tariquidar, elacridar or vehicle. The paclitaxel concentrations in the brains of the <b>valspodar</b> group were 5 to 8. 5 times higher than in the control group, whereas in the elacridar and tariquidar groups an only 4 fold increase compared to the control group was measured. Compared with <b>valspodar,</b> the brain/plasma ratio of paclitaxel in mice treated with elacridar or tariquidar indicates a more specific accumulation of paclitaxel in the brain. Although the increase in paclitaxel brain concentration in case of elacridar and tariquidar co-administration was not as pronounced as in case of <b>valspodar,</b> a dose reduction of anticancer drugs, as in case of <b>valspodar</b> paclitaxel co-administration, seems unnecessary with new modulators, {{due to the lack of}} p-gp modulation in liver and kidney, and the low cytostatic drugs concentrations in plasma. Another method to increase intracerebral drug concentrations is the utilization of the transferrin receptor mediated transcytosis at the BBB for drug delivery to the brain. To be able to perform treatment studies with cytostatic drug loaded immunoliposomes targeted to the transferrin receptor both at the BBB and in tumor cells, a tumor model of primary brain tumors in the brain of nude rats was established. For this purpose, three human glioblastoma cell lines were examined, but only the U- 373 MG cells turned out to be suited as an orthotopic tumor model. In summary, the administration of p-gp modulators of the 3 rd generation in combination with anticancer drugs is a promising strategy for the treatment of {{primary and secondary}} brain tumors. Approaches exploiting specific transcytotic pathways at the BBB might also enhance the concentrations of cytostatic drugs in the brain, a prerequisite for a successful therapy of malignant brain tumors...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Previously, {{we studied}} {{the effect of}} co-administration of {{paclitaxel}} with the second generation ABCB 1 (p-gp) modulator <b>valspodar</b> on the intracerebral growth of human U 118 -MG glioblastoma in nude mice. <b>Valspodar</b> significantly increased the brain levels of paclitaxel by inhibition of p-gp expressed at the blood brain barrier. Thus, the tumour burden was reduced by 90 %, which was considered as a proof of concept. However, the paclitaxel dose had to be reduced because of toxic side effects resulting from increased drug levels due to p-gp modulation in peripheral tissues. Therefore, {{in the present study}} we examined the co-application of paclitaxel with the third generation ABCB 1 modulators elacridar and tariquidar, which were supposed to preferentially modulate p-gp in brain capillaries. METHODS: The inhibitory activity of the modulators was measured by a flow cytometric and a chemosensitivity assay in vitro. To determine the distribution of paclitaxel in vivo, nude mice received 50 mg/kg of <b>valspodar,</b> elacridar or tariquidar p. o. (control: vehicle) 4 h before i. v. injection of 8 mg/kg of paclitaxel. Brain, liver, kidney and plasma were collected and analyzed by RP-HPLC. RESULTS: Our in vitro experiments demonstrate that the new modulators are about 80 times more effective in comparison to <b>valspodar.</b> Co-administration of paclitaxel with elacridar and tariquidar led to a long lasting fivefold increase in the concentration of the cytostatic in the brain. Although the increase (2. 5 - to 7 -fold) tended to be lower compared to that induced by co-administered <b>valspodar</b> (six- to eightfold), the brain/plasma ratios achieved with the new modulators were 2 - 15 times higher. CONCLUSIONS: Elacridar and tariquidar seem to modulate p-glycoprotein preferentially at the blood-brain barrier. Our results suggest that the systemic toxicity of cytostatics combined with elacridar or tariquidar should be lower than in combination with <b>valspodar...</b>|$|E

We examined whether <b>valspodar,</b> a selective inhibitor of the ATP binding cassette B 1 transporter (ABCB 1, a. k. a., p-glycoprotein/multidrug resistance protein- 1) used in the neoadjuvant setting would sensitize LPCs to doxorubicin and extend the length of remission in dogs with therapy naïve large B-cell lymphoma. Twenty dogs were enrolled into a double-blinded, placebo controlled study where experimental and control groups received oral <b>valspodar</b> (7. 5 mg/kg) or placebo, respectively, twice daily for five days followed by five treatments with doxorubicin 21 days apart with {{a reduction in the}} first dose to mitigate the potential side effects of ABCB 1 inhibition. Lymph node and blood LPCs were quantified at diagnosis, on the fourth day of neoadjuvant period, and 1 -week after the first chemotherapy dose. <b>Valspodar</b> therapy was well tolerated. There were no differences between groups in total LPCs in lymph nodes or peripheral blood, nor in event-free survival or overall survival. Overall, we conclude that <b>valspodar</b> can be administered safely in the neoadjuvant setting for canine B-cell lymphoma; however, its use to attenuate ABCB 1 + cells does not alter the composition of lymph node or blood LPCs, and it {{does not appear to be}} sufficient to prolong doxorubicin-dependent remissions in this setting...|$|E
40|$|Ticagrelor is {{the unique}} {{reversible}} oral antiplatelet drug commercialized today. During this study, the intestinal permeability of ticagrelor {{and its potential}} P-glycoprotein (P-gp) -mediated active transport were assessed. To this end, bidirectional transport of ticagrelor was performed across Caco- 2 (human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma) monolayer model in the presence and absence of potent P-gp inhibitor <b>valspodar.</b> Ticagrelor presented an apical-basolateral apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of 6. 0 × 10 (- 6) cm/s. On the other hand, mean efflux ratio (ER) of 2. 71 was observed for ticagrelor describing a higher efflux permeability compared to the influx component. <b>Valspodar</b> showed a significant inhibitory effect on the efflux of ticagrelor suggesting involvement of P-gp in its oral disposition. Co-incubation of the P-gp inhibitor decreased the efflux Papp of ticagrelor from 1. 60 × 10 (- 5) to 1. 13 × 10 (- 5) cm/s and decreased its ER by 70 %. Results suggest a modest active transport of ticagrelor by P-gp across the Caco- 2 cell monolayer. The co-administration of ticagrelor with a P-gp inhibitor seems altogether unlikely to have an extended impact on pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor and cause bleeding events in patients...|$|E
40|$|Paclitaxel {{concentrations}} in the brain are very low after intravenous injection. Since paclitaxel is excluded from some tumors by p-glycoprotein (p-gp), the same mechanism may prevent entry into the brain. In vitro, paclitaxel transport was examined in capillaries from rat brains by confocal microscopy using BODIPY Fl-paclitaxel. Western blots and immunostaining demonstrated apical expression of p-gp in isolated endothelial cells, vessels, and tissue. Secretion of BODIPY Fl-paclitaxel into capillary lumens was specific and energy-dependent. Steady state luminal fluorescence significantly exceeded cellular fluorescence and was reduced by NaCN, paclitaxel, and SDZ PSC- 833 (<b>valspodar),</b> a p-gp blocker. Leukotriene C 4 (LTC 4), an Mrp 2 -substrate, had no effect. Luminal accumulation of NBDL-cyclosporin, a p-gp substrate, was inhibited by paclitaxel. In vivo, paclitaxel levels in the brain, liver, kidney, and plasma of nude mice were determined after intravenous injection. Co-administration of <b>valspodar</b> led to increased paclitaxel levels in brains compared to monotherapy. Therapeutic relevance was proven for nude mice with implanted intracerebral human U- 118 MG glioblastoma. Whereas paclitaxel did not affect tumor volume, co-administration of paclitaxel (intravenous) and PSC 833 (peroral) reduced tumor volume by 90 %. Thus, p-gp is an important obstacle preventing paclitaxel entry into the brain, and inhibition of this transporter allows the drug to reach sensitive tumors within the CNS...|$|E

Two out of these 43 plant extracts (extracts of Annickia kummeriae and Acacia nilotica) appeared to have a modulatory effect on P-gp related efflux carriers.

Leukemia K 562 /R 7 cells and sarcoma MES-SA/Dx 5 cells expressing high levels of the MDR 1 (ABCB 1) gene were resistant to IDA (42 -fold and 150 -fold, respectively). In both of these cell lines, resistance to IDA was equivalent to that for doxorubicin, the drug used to select for the MDR variants. The P-gp inhibitor PSC 833 (<b>valspodar)</b> at 2 mM completely restored sensitivity to IDA. IDA accumulation was decreased 12 -fold in MES-SA/ Dx 5 cells vs parental cell line, and drug uptake was restored to control levels by PSC 833. Reduced intracellular IDA was correlated with P-gp content by flow cytometry.

The pharmacokinetics of sunitinib was examined in rats treated with PSC 833 (<b>valspodar)</b> and pantoprazole, potent inhibitors of P-gp and BCRP, respectively. The sunitinib concentrations in plasma, bile, liver, kidney, and brain were determined by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spec-trometry. It was found that the area under the concentration-time curve for 4 hours (AUC 0 – 4) and maximum concentration (Cmax) of sunitinib administered intraintestinally were significantly increased by pretreatment with PSC 833 or pantoprazole. Each inhibitor markedly reduced the biliary excretion of sunitinib for 60 minutes after an intravenous administration and significantly increased the distribution of sunitinib to the liver as well as kidney. In addition, the brain distribution of sunitinib was significantly increased by PSC 833 but not pantoprazole, and coadministration of both inhibitors further enhanced the accumulation of sunitinib in the brain.

Western blot analysis confirmed a moderate increase in the expression of P-glycoprotein and MRP 2, but not MRP 1 also at the protein level.

40|$|ABSTRACT Bacteria {{coordinate}} {{a variety}} of social behaviors, important for both environmental and pathogenic bacteria, through a process of intercellular chemical signaling known as quorum sensing (QS). As microbial resistance to antibiotics grows more common, a critical need has emerged to develop novel anti-infective therapies, such as an ability to attenuate bacte-rial pathogens by means of QS interference. Rgg quorum-sensing pathways, widespread in the phylum Firmicutes, employ cyto-plasmic pheromone receptors (Rgg transcription factors) that directly bind and elicit gene expression responses to imported peptide signals. In the human-restricted pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, the Rgg 2 /Rgg 3 regulatory circuit controls biofilm development in response to the short hydrophobic peptides SHP 2 and SHP 3. Using Rgg-SHP as a model receptor-ligand target, we sought to identify chemical compounds that could specifically inhibit Rgg quorum-sensing circuits. Individual compounds from a diverse library of known drugs and drug-like molecules were screened for their ability to disrupt complexes of Rgg and FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) -conjugated SHP using a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay. The best hits were found to bind Rgg 3 in vitrowith submicromolar affinities, to specifically abolish transcription of Rgg 2 / 3 -controlled genes, and to prevent bio-film development in S. pyogeneswithout affecting bacterial growth. Furthermore, the top hit, cyclosporine A, as well as its non-immunosuppressive analog, <b>valspodar,</b> inhibited Rgg-SHP pathways in multiple species of Streptococcus.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the involvement of P-gp in the transport of acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon and warfarin using an in vitro Caco- 2 cell monolayer model. These results were compared with those obtained with rivaroxaban, a new oral anticoagulant known to be a P-gp substrate. The transport of these four drugs was assessed at pH conditions 6. 8 / 7. 4 in the presence or absence of the P-gp inhibitor cyclosporine A (10  μM) and the more potent and specific P-gp inhibitor <b>valspodar</b> (5  μM). Analytical quantification was performed by LC/MS. With an efflux ratio of 1. 7 and a significant decrease in the efflux (Papp B-A), in the presence of P-gp inhibitors at a concentration of 50  μM, acenocoumarol can be considered as a weak P-gp substrate. Concerning phenprocoumon, the results suggest that this molecule is a poor P-gp substrate. The P-gp inhibitors did not affect significantly the transport of warfarin. The efflux of rivaroxaban was strongly inhibited by the two P-gp inhibitors. In conclusion, none of the three VKAs tested are strong P-gp substrates.

Ivermectin is known to interact with P-glycoprotein (P-gp/MDR 1), being a good substrate and a potent inhibitor, however, the influence of ivermectin on {{the expression of the}} transporter has not been investigated. Expression of P-glycoprotein was investigated in cultured mouse hepatocytes acutely exposed to ivermectin. The two P-glycoprotein murine isoforms, Mdr 1 a and Mdr 1 b, mRNA levels were assessed by real-time RT-PCR. Ivermectin induced a clear time- and concentration-dependent up-regulation of Mdr 1 a and Mdr 1 b mRNA levels (as early as a 12 -h exposure and up to 2. 5 -fold at 10 mu M). Moreover, ivermectin-treated cells displayed enhanced cellular efflux of the P-glycoprotein substrate calcein that was inhibited by the P-glycoprotein blocker <b>valspodar,</b> providing evidence that the ivermectin-induced P-glycoprotein was functional. The mechanisms underlying these effects were investigated. lvermectin-mediated Mdr 1 mRNA induction was independent of the two nuclear receptors CAR and PXR, which are known to be involved in drug transporters regulation. Moreover, by using reporter cell lines that detects specific ligand-activated transcription factors, we showed that ivermectin did not displayed CAR, PXR or AhR ligand activities. However, studies with actinomycin D revealed that the half-life of Mdr 1 a and Mdr 1 b mRNA were significantly prolonged by two-fold in ivermectin-treated cells suggesting a post-transcriptional mode of ivermectin regulation.

P-gp has also been implicated in causing apoptosis of tumor cells, which was shown to be another important mechanism of MDR recently. To study the influence of P-gp in tumor cell apoptosis, K 562 /A cells (P-gp+) and K 562 /S cells (P-gp−) were subjected to doxorubicin (Dox), serum withdrawal, or independent co-incubation with multiple P-gp inhibitors, including <b>valspodar</b> (PSC 833), verapamil (Ver) and H 108 to induce apoptosis. Apoptosis was simultaneously detected by apoptotic rate, cell cycle by flow cytometry and cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease 3 (caspase 3) activity by immunoassay. Cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by PSC 833 were evaluated through an MTT method and apoptosis rate, and cell cycle combined with caspase 3 activity, respectively. The results show that K 562 /A cells are more resistant to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest than K 562 /S cells after treatment with Dox or serum deprivation. The apoptosis of K 562 /A cells increased after co-incubation with each of the inhibitors of P-gp. P-gp inhibitors also enhanced cell cycle arrest in K 562 /A cell. PSC 833 most strikingly decreased viability and led to apoptosis and S phase arrest of cell cycle in K 562 /A cells. Our study demonstrates that P-gp inhibits the apoptosis of tumor cells in addition to participating in the efflux of intracellular chemotherapy drugs. The results of the caspase 3 activity assay also suggest that the role of P-gp in apoptosis avoidance is caspase-related...|$|E
40|$|P-glycoproteins (P-gps) play an {{important}} role in the sensitivity of nematodes to anthelmintic drugs. They have been implicated in a number of anthelmintic resistances, particularly for macrocyclic lactone drugs. Hence, inhibition of nematode P-gps has been suggested as a means of reversing some types of anthelmintic resistance. The present study aimed to investigate the ability of the most-recently developed group of P-gp inhibitors (the so-called 2 ̆ 7 third generation 2 ̆ 7 of inhibitors) including tariquidar, zosuquidar and elacridar, to increase the sensitivity of Haemonchus contortus larvae to various anthelmintics (ivermectin, levamisole and thiabendazole) in vitro. We compared these compounds to some older P-gp inhibitors (e. g. verapamil and <b>valspodar).</b> Larval migration and development assays were used to measure the sensitivity of larvae to anthelmintics alone, or in combination with P-gp inhibitors. Significant increases in sensitivity to ivermectin were observed with zosuquidar and tariquidar in larval migration assays (synergism ratios up to 6 -fold). Several of the inhibitors increased the sensitivity of both the drug-resistant and -susceptible isolates (e. g. tariquidar with ivermectin in migration assays, zosuquidar with ivermectin in larval development assays), while others had significant effects on the resistant isolate only (e. g. zosuquidar with ivermectin in migration assays, verapamil with ivermectin in development assays). This suggests that some of the inhibitors interact with P-gps representing intrinsic pathways present across nematode populations with quite different drug sensitivities, while other inhibitors interact with P-gps of significance only to resistant nematodes, and hence most likely representing an acquired resistance mechanism. The study highlights the potential of the third generation of P-gp inhibitors for increasing the sensitivity of nematodes to anthelmintics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Inhibition of P-gp-mediated R 123 efflux by 12 N,N-bis(cyclohexanolamine) aryl esters and 4 significantly correlated with LBE values.

Since the clusters of DBD amino acid residues interacting with EPI were different, if EPI docked alone or after pre-docking of EPI or 2 c, the existence of alternative secondary binding site for EPI on P-gp is credible.

40|$|ABSTRACT − The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of morin, an antioxidant, on the bioavailability of doxorubicin (DOX) in rats. Thus, DOX was administered intravenously (10 mg/kg) or orally (50 mg/kg) with or without oral morin (0. 5, 3 and 10 mg/kg). In the presence of morin, the total area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) of DOX was significantly greater than that of the control. In the presence of 3 and 10 mg/kg of morin, the peak concentration (C max) was significantly higher than that of the control. Consequently, the absolute bioavailability (AB) of DOX in the pres-ence of morin was 3. 7 - 8. 3 %, which was significantly enhanced compared with those of the control group (2. 7 %). The rel-ative bioavailability (RB) of DOX was 1. 36 to 3. 02 times higher than those of the control group. Compared to the intravenous control, the presence of morin increased the AUC of DOX, but was not significantly affected. The enhanced bioavailability of oral DOX by oral morin may be due to the inhibition of both P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3 A in the intestine and/or liver by morin. This result may suggest that the development of oral DOX combination with morin is feasible, which is more convenient than the i. v. dosage forms. The present study raised the awareness about the potential drug interactions by concomitant use of DOX with morin.

We studied metabolism {{and transport}} of the citrus flavonoid hesperetin, the aglycone of hesperidin, using a two-compartment transwell Caco- 2 cell monolayer system, simulating the intestinal barrier. The role of apically located ABC transporters P-glycoprotein (MDR 1 /ABCB 1), multidrug resistance protein 2 (ABCC 2), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ ABCG 2) in the efflux of hesperetin and its metabolites was studied by coadministration of compounds known to inhibit several classes of ABC transporters, including cyclosporin A, GF 120918 [N-(4 -[2 -(1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro- 6, 7 -dimethoxy- 2 -isoquinolinyl) ethyl]-phenyl) - 9, 10 -dihydro- 5 -methoxy- 9 -oxo- 4 -acridine carboxamide], Ko 143 [3 -(6 -isobutyl- 9 -methoxy- 1, 4 -dioxo- 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 12 a-octahydropyrazino[1 ', 2 ': 1, 6]pyrido[3, 4 -b]indol- 3 -yl) -propionic acid tert-butyl ester], MK 571 (3 -[[3 -[2 -(7 -chloroquinolin- 2 -yl) vinyl]phenyl]-(2 -dimethylcarbamoylethylsulfanyl) methylsulfanyl] propionic acid), and PSC- 833 (<b>Valspodar).</b> Apically applied hesperetin (10 µM) was metabolized into hesperetin 7 -O-glucuronide and hesperetin 7 -O-sulfate, identified using high-performance liquid chromatographydiode array detector (DAD), ultraperformance liquid chromatography-DAD-tandem mass spectrometry, and authentic standards, which were transported predominantly to the apical side of the Caco- 2 cell monolayer (1. 12 cm 2), at average (S.

Hesperetin aglycone also permeated to the basolateral side, and this process was unaffected by the inhibitors used, possibly implying a passive diffusion process. Inhibition studies, however, showed that efflux of hesperetin conjugates to the apical side involved active transport, which from the pattern of inhibition appeared to involve mainly BCRP. Upon inhibition by the BCRP inhibitor Ko 143 (5 µM), the apical efflux of hesperetin conjugates was 1. 9 -fold reduced (p 0. 01), and transport to the basolateral side was 3. 1 -fold increased (p 0. 001).

40|$|Domperidone is a {{dopamine}} D 2 -receptor antagonist, {{which has}} been marketed in Europe as a prokinetic and anti-emetic drug. Previously, {{it has been reported}} that domperidone is extensively metabolized (mainly by CYP 3 A) 1 and is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 2. However, to our knowledge, there is no literature data on the hepatic uptake of domperidone. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether hepatic uptake transporter(s) are involved in the transport of domperidone into hepatocytes. Domperidone disposition was assessed using rat and human suspended hepatocytes. Both in rat and human hepatocytes, domperidone (5 µM) uptake was very rapid, with equilibrium of accumulation reached already after 0. 5 min. The mean (± SD) accumulation rate of domperidone in rat and human hepatocytes was 2603 ± 339 and 2040 ± 789 pmol/min/million cells, respectively. Moreover, uptake was temperature-dependent, with mean (± SD) uptake rates at 4 °C of 963 ± 181 pmol/min/million cells and 380 ± 93 pmol/min/million cells in rat and human hepatocytes, respectively. When the cells were pretreated with 50 µM of the Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide (OATP/Oatp; human/rat) inhibitor rifampicin, no significant effects were observed. However, co-incubation with aminobenzotriazole (ABT; 500 µM; CYP inhibitor) significantly (p < 0. 05) increased domperidone accumulation after 10 min by 141. 4 ± 8. 6 %. Concentration-dependent (0. 1 – 50 µM) uptake kinetics of domperidone were described by a Km and Vmax value in cryopreserved rat hepatocytes (n = 1) of 51 ± 15 µM and 23407 ± 3936 pmol/min/million cells, respectively. In rat hepatocytes, 100 and 200 µM fluoxetine (inhibitor of the Organic Cation Transporter; OCT/Oct) decreased the domperidone accumulation to 85. 2 ± 5. 5 and 27. 6 ± 3. 0 %, respectively, compared to the control, suggesting possible Oct-mediated uptake of domperidone. On the contrary, co-incubation of domperidone with Ntcp (Sodium Taurocholate Co-transporting Polypeptide) or other Oatp inhibitors showed no effects on domperidone uptake. In human hepatocytes, both fluoxetine (100 µM) and taurocholic acid (inhibitor of NTCP/Ntcp; 50 µM) decreased the domperidone uptake to 50 ± 10 and 77 ± 8 %, respectively, compared to the control. Known P-gp inhibitors, <b>valspodar,</b> zosuquidar and digoxin increased the accumulation of domperidone, as reported previously. In conclusion, our results suggest that domperidone hepatic uptake is transporter-mediated by OCT/Oct and/or Ntcp in rat and human hepatocytes. 1. 	Simard, C. et al.

40|$|The ABCB 1 {{transporter}} (P-glycoprotein), an ATP-driven efflux protein, strongly {{influences the}} absorption, distribution and excretion of various drugs. As {{an essential component}} of the blood-brain barrier, P-glycoprotein limits the penetration of potent cytostatic agents (e. g. paclitaxel) into the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, over-expression of ABCB 1 transporters in tumor cells {{is one of the major}} mechanisms of classical multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer. Hence, inhibition of P glycoprotein is an attractive strategy to improve the therapy of both, tumors in the CNS and MDR malignancies in the periphery. Accordingly, a series of potent inhibitors derived from the 3 rd generation P-glycoprotein modulator tariquidar was investigated in vitro. A fluorescence-based efflux-assay using human Kb-V 1 cells was established at the microtiter plate format. The obtained data were in good agreement with the validated flow cytometric method while throughput was substantially increased. Additionally, cells expressing the murine transporter were generated to assure activity at rodent P-glycoprotein. Further biopharmaceutical investigations (concerning toxicity, stability, plasma albumin binding and inhibition of cytochrome P 450 isoenzymes) confirmed the suitability of tariquidar and the three most promising derivatives (bearing polar residues such as a methoxyethoxyethylamino (ME 27 - 4), a morpholino (ME 30 - 1) or an ethoxyethyloxy (ME 33 - 1) moiety) for further in vivo studies. In order to determine the concentration of the selected modulators in brain and plasma samples, a solid-phase extraction procedure followed by RP-HPLC analysis was established and validated. The method yielded reproducible high recoveries, a low limit of quantification as well as high accuracy and precision. The concomitant administration of paclitaxel in successive bio-distribution studies in NMRI mice revealed favorable bioavailability and high metabolic stability of the tariquidar-like compounds. As desired, the modulators significantly increased the brain AUC of paclitaxel. The observed increase by a factor of two to four correlated with the previously determined in vitro potency of the various inhibitors. In contrast to the co-administration of the 2 nd generation modulator <b>valspodar,</b> the plasma AUC of paclitaxel was unaffected, indicating lower systemic toxicity. To investigate if the increased paclitaxel brain concentration is of relevance for the therapy of malignant brain tumors, an intracerebral xenograft model in nude mice was refined. Human U 118 MG glioblastoma cells were transfected with the genes encoding for the far-red fluorescent protein or the luciferase 2 (Luc 2) enzyme to facilitate non-invasive determination of tumor burden by means of fluorescence or bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Tumors originating from intracerebral injection of luciferase 2 expressing cells were detectable in the living animal. Unfortunately, the growth behavior was unsuitable for the intended in vivo investigations. Alternatively, highly tumorigenic U 87 -Luc 2 xenografts were utilized for subsequent treatment experiments evaluating the combination of paclitaxel with the most potent modulators ME 33 - 1 or tariquidar. Since the obtained light signals largely correlated with the histological determined tumor burden, BLI revealed a moderate retardation of tumor progression when paclitaxel was combined with an ABCB 1 modulator. Furthermore, the therapeutic value of the co-administration of ABCB 1 modulators with paclitaxel in the treatment of MDR tumors was investigated. For this purpose, ABCB 1 transporter over-expressing Kb-V 1 cells were extensively characterized in vitro followed by subcutaneous implantation into nude mice. The resulting malignancies showed high tumorigenicity, reproducible growth kinetics and maintained transporter expression in vivo. In subsequent treatment experiments ME 30 - 1, ME 33 - 1 and tariquidar were investigated. In contrast to the other modulators, only the combination of ME 30 - 1 with paclitaxel significantly slowed down the growth of Kb-V 1 tumors compared to paclitaxel mono-therapy. Additionally, molecular modeling investigations were performed based on the very recently published x-ray structure of the murine Abcb 1 a transporter. Conformational analysis of the tariquidar-like modulators provided the starting conformation for successive docking experiments. The location of the subsequently identified binding region is in accordance with the suggested transport mechanism and experimental data from the literature. The proposed binding modes largely agree with the inhibitory potencies of the investigated ABCB 1 modulators and explain the negligible ABCB 1 activity of tariquidar-derived, selective ABCG 2 modulators. The findings facilitate the structure based design of optimized ABCB 1 modulators and may contribute to improve the adjuvant cancer chemotherapy of glioblastomas and MDR tumors. ...|$|E
40|$|Multidrug {{transporter}} proteins such as ABCB 1, ABCC 1 and ABCG 2 {{are known}} to contribute the chemoresistance of malignant tumors. Expression of these transporters by cancer cells leads to an efflux of anticancer drugs. The inhibition of efflux pumps, namely ABCB 1, has been explored in clinical trials to overcome ABC transporter mediated drug resistance in cancer patients, but {{did not lead to}} a drug approval. The limitations of this approach can be explained by multiple resistance mechanisms including the contribution of ABC transporters other than ABCB 1. The relevance of ABCG 2 inhibition has not been adequately explored. Apart from chemoresistance in cancer, ABC transporters play a major role as efflux pumps expressed in epithelia and endothelial cells, influencing the bioavailability, tissue distribution and the excretion of drugs. In particular, modulation of ABC transporters at the blood brain barrier (BBB) may considerably increase the entry of drugs into the central nervous system (CNS) and enhance the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy, including the chemotherapy of malignancies in the CNS, as demonstrated in a proof-of-concept study in mice with paclitaxel in combination with the ABCB 1 modulator <b>valspodar.</b> This strategy should even be more effective in case of inhibition of ABCG 2, as this transporter is considered {{to be the most important}} efflux transporter at the BBB. To prove this hypothesis, potent and selective ABCG 2 modulators are required. This doctoral project was pursued in collaboration with Prof. Dr. B. König (Institute of Organic Chemistry, University of Regensburg), aiming at the development of selective ABCG 2 modulators. Previously reported quinoline carboxamide-type compounds from our laboratory were highly potent and selective ABCG 2 modulators, but revealed unfavourable physico-chemical properties due to poor solubility and rapid enzymatic cleavage of a central benzamide bond. Next generation inhibitors were characterized in various functional assays (Hoechst 33342, calcein-AM, pheophorbide a, kinetic cytotoxicity assay) available in our laboratory. Additional in vitro models for the characterization of the transporter inhibitors were established (mitoxantrone microplate assay for ABCG 2, ABCG 2 -ATPase assay using Sf 9 membranes), the selectivity for ABCG 2 compared to ABCB 1 and ABCC 1 was determined, and (bio) analytical studies (plasma protein binding by ultrafiltration, equilibrium dialysis, isothermal titration calorimetry and HPLC; stability against enzymatic cleavage) were performed. Preliminary preclinical studies in nude mice bearing orthotopically implanted genetically modified human glioblastoma enabling optical in vivo imaging, proved that U- 87 MG xenografts grow rapidly in the brain. However, these tumors were too aggressive to perform therapeutic studies. Therefore, in search for a more appropriate tumor entity, three malignant human brain tumor cell lines (Daoy, LN 18, SW 1783) were characterized regarding growth kinetics, chemosensitivity against several anti-cancer drugs, and ABC transporter expression as well as tumorigenicity in a subcutaneous tumor model in nude mice. Bioisosteric replacement of the central amide core of the first and second generation of ABCG 2 inhibitors by a biphenyl, quinoline, indol or triazole moiety resulted in chemically more stable compounds, and the introduction of triethyleneglycol residues increased solubility. In the new compound libraries dual ABCB 1 /ABCG 2 and ABCG 2 -selective modulators were identified which are among the most potent BCRP inhibitors reported so far (IC 50 in the two-digit nM range). Selected ABCG 2 modulators were additionally investigated in an in vitro model of the BBB (porcine brain capillary endothelial cell layer, expressing ABCG 2; cooperation with Prof. H. J. Galla, University of Münster) to get closer to the physiological situation and to predict the influence of the compounds on the penetration of co administered drugs into the brain of nude mice bearing orthotopically growing xenografts. Surprisingly, in the BBB model the investigated inhibitors were much more potent than in the fluorescence based assays. The reduced transport of a substrate used to determine ABCG 2 activity in the presence of a modulator may result from different modes of action: competition of the test compound with the indicator as a substrate or inhibition of the transport. To discriminate between the mechanisms of modulation, a colorimetric ATPase assay in the microplate format was established using membrane preparations from baculovirus-infected Sf 9 cells expressing the human ABCG 2 protein. All tested compounds turned out to be ‘true’ ABCG 2 inhibitors, capable of inhibiting substrate-induced ATPase activity. In summary, the new ABCG 2 modulators were highly potent inhibitors, but showed poor water solubility and very high plasma protein binding (almost 100...|$|E
40|$|No {{effective}} chemotherapy for {{the treatment}} of malignant brain tumors, especially glioblastoma, exists so far. Despite the progress in surgical techniques and advances in the irradiation treatment, the concomitant chemotherapy is essential for the prevention of relapse and of major importance for patient outcome. The introduction of temozolomide combined with radiation in clinical practice led to slightly improved long-term survival, but malignant gliomas remain resistant to cancer chemotherapy. Thus, new strategies {{for the treatment}} of brain tumors are still needed. Objectives of this work were the evaluation of the TmHU protein as siRNA transfection reagent (Chapter 2), investigations on new kinesin Eg 5 inhibitors, which specifically inhibit cell division during mitosis (Chapter 3), and the exploration of new tariquidar analogs as ABCB 1 and ABCG 2 inhibitors (Chapter 4). Due to the selective down-regulation of oncogene expression by small interfering RNA, siRNAs are considered as promising anticancer agents allowing the selective killing of tumor cells. The suitability of the non-toxic TmHU protein as siRNA transfection reagent was explored in vitro and in vivo in order to investigate the down-regulation of gene expression in human glioblastoma cells. The efficient transfection of the cancer cells is a prerequisite for this new concept, and, therefore, reliable in vitro and in vivo models were developed for the proof of principle. A suitable and convenient in vitro method was established for the quick detection of siRNA effects on the EGFP or DsRed 2 expression, respectively, with respect to total cell number by using a fluorescence plate reader. In order to study siRNA effects in vivo subcutaneous tumor models were established in nude mice and two fluorescence detection methods were evaluated. The fluorescence intensity was quantified by confocal laser scanning microscopy of paraffin embedded tumor sections and by in vivo imaging. In preliminary tests with micro-osmotic pumps the continuous release of a suspension and the practicability of subcutaneous implantation were assured. Unfortunately, the established in vivo methods could not be used for the intended investigations on TmHU because this protein was not suitable for siRNA transfection. Nevertheless, these methods are recommendable for the investigation of promising in vivo transfection reagents. The inhibition of kinesin Eg 5 by small molecules such as monastrol is currently evaluated as an approach to develop a novel class of antiproliferative drugs {{for the treatment of}} malignant tumors. Therefore, the effects of new monastrol analogs on the proliferation of human U- 87 MG, U- 118 MG, and U- 373 MG glioblastoma cells were investigated. Compared to monastrol, the new cell cycle specific compounds showed an at least one order of magnitude higher antiproliferative activity. The compounds were neither inactivated by hydrolysis nor by binding to serum proteins. Due to the necessity of overcoming the blood�brain barrier (BBB) in the treatment of brain tumors, it was investigated if the new monastrol analogues are modulators or substrates of the ABCB 1 transporter by a flow cytometric calcein-AM efflux assay. The tested compounds showed no modulating effects on the ABCB 1 function. With respect to the treatment of primary and secondary CNS tumors, the results suggest that the new monastrol analogs represent an interesting class of potential anticancer drugs, predicted to be less neurotoxic in comparison to classical tubulin inhibitors. The efflux of cytostatics due to expression of ABC transporters such as ABCB 1 and ABCG 2 at the BBB leads to extremely low drug concentrations in the brain and is therefore a major limitation in cancer chemotherapy. A strategy to overcome the BBB is the administration of an efflux inhibitor in combination with a cytostatic. The 3 rd generation inhibitor tariquidar led to better brain/plasma ratios of paclitaxel but could not increase the paclitaxel brain levels compared to co-administration of the 2 nd generation inhibitor <b>valspodar.</b> The very high tariquidar brain levels indicate that the very lipophilic tariquidar is trapped in the lipid compartment of the brain. Aiming at tariquidar analogs with improved solubility and pharmacokinetics, more hydrophilic analogs were synthesized. The compounds were investigated on ABCB 1 overexpressing Kb-V 1 and ABCG 2 overexpressing MCF- 7 /Topo cells for inhibitory activity and for cytotoxicity, alone and in combination with cytostatics. Surprisingly, slight structural modifications resulted in ABCG 2 selective inhibitors. Three analogs have IC 50 values of 55, 100, and 154 nM, comparable with the most potent reported ABCG 2 inhibitor Ko 143. Some ABCG 2 inhibitors showed specific toxicity which could be advantageous regarding the treatment of brain tumors. These very potent and selective ABCG 2 inhibitors should be useful pharmacological tools for in vitro and in vivo investigations...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the {{mechanisms by which}} a drug is absorbed from the intestinal lumen into the blood, many techniques have been developed over the years. In early drug discovery, the absorption properties of new chemical entities are usually assessed by high-throughput techniques, e. g., automated Caco- 2 screening. In the later drug discovery stages, when drug properties are being optimized and/or when detailed insight into the mechanisms underlying oral drug disposition isrequired, Caco- 2 cells or more advanced absorption models (Ussing Chambers or intestinal perfusion systems) are being used. The Caco- 2 model has many advantages, {{including the fact that}} (1) it is from human origin, (2) it is suitable for high-throughput screening, (3) it allows retrieving absorption mechanisms as it expresses a wide variety of uptake and efflux transporters, and (4) it provides a good prediction ofthe fraction absorbed (Fa) for passively transported drugs in humans. Unfortunately, this model has also some drawbacks: (1) the expression of CYP 3 A 4 (which is the most abundant phase I drug-metabolizing enzyme present in the human small intestine) is very low to non-existent, whichmay result in overprediction of drug transport, (2) there is no mucus layer which protects the cells and forms an extra barrier for compounds to reach the cells, (3) pregnane X receptor (PXR) -mediated drug-drug interactions cannot be studied since this nuclear receptor is not expressed, (4) there are interlaboratory differences in enzyme and drug transporter expression levels. Another absorption model which can be considered in late discovery and early development stages is the in situintestinal perfusion with mesenteric blood collection. Of all presentlyavailable models, it is the closest one to the in vivo situation becauseof (1) an intact intestinal mucosa, nerve system and blood flow; (2) thepresence of sink conditions; and (3) the expression of all relevant enzymes and transporters. The rat is the standard animal used in this technique. Recently, the in situ intestinal perfusion technique with mesenteric blood sampling was successfully downsized from the rat to themouse in our laboratory, which opens new opportunities in pharmaceuticalresearch. First, the use of knockout mice allows studying the involvement of one specific drug transporter or enzyme in the absorptionof a drug. This may not be possible with the use of chemical inhibitorsdue to a lack of specificity. Second, transgenic (humanized) mice, which carry human genes in their genome, may be invaluable in order to eliminate species differences between rodents and humans. The aim of this dissertation research was to evaluate the use of the mouse in the in situ intestinal perfusion technique with mesenteric blood sampling. We investigated the use of wild-type, knockout and humanized mice in different studies, of which the specific objectives were to: 1),,Validate the use of P-gp knockout mice in the in situ intestinal perfusion technique, and explore the role of P-gp in the intestinal permeability for darunavir. 2),,Investigate the use of the mouse in situ intestinal perfusion technique to elucidate the role of both efflux transporters (P-gp) and metabolism (P 450) towards the intestinal absorption of HIV protease inhibitors. 3),,Evaluate the use of PXR/CYP 3 A 4 -humanized mice for studying drug-druginteractions involving intestinal P-glycoprotein. The effect of rifampicin (PXR activator) was investigated on the intestinal permeability for darunavir. 4),,Explore a novel combination of human intestinal fluids (HIF) with the mouse in situ intestinal perfusion technique to assess food effects. We used indinavir as model compound. HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) were selected as model compounds in our studies because of their interesting pharmacokinetic properties. The drugs of this class are characterized by an extensive first-pass elimination as they are metabolized by CYP 3 A 4 present in the liver and intestine. In addition, these drugs {{have been shown to be}} substrates ofefflux transporters present in the intestine, which potentially limit their absorption. The most important and best characterized intestinal efflux transporter is P-glycoprotein (P-gp), present in the apical membrane of enterocytes. Although all PIs were shown to be substrates of P-gp, the exact role of P-gp in limiting their intestinal absorption in vivo remains to be elucidated. As a consequence of their unfavorablepharmacokinetics, PIs are always co-administered with the pharmacokinetic booster ritonavir, which is known to inhibit their CYP 3 A 4 -mediated metabolism. In addition, ritonavir is a known P-gp inhibitor, thereby potentially inhibiting their intestinal efflux. In the first part of this doctoral research, we evaluated the use of P-gp knockout mice in the in situ intestinal perfusion technique. We explored the contribution of P-gp to the transport characteristics of darunavir (up to 100 µM) using Caco- 2 monolayers and the in situ intestinal perfusion technique using wild-type and mdr 1 a/ 1 b(#/#) mice. We observed that, in vitro, P-gp has a modulatory effect on the absorption of darunavir, even at a concentration of 100 µM (efflux ratio= 25). Fasted state simulated intestinal fluids (FaSSIF) partially inhibited P-gp functionality, which was further inhibited by including the P-gp inhibitors verapamil, PSC 833 (<b>valspodar),</b> GF 120918 (elacridar),or ritonavir. Using the in situ intestinal perfusion technique, we demonstrated that co-perfusion with ritonavir resulted in a similar apparent permeability coefficient to that observed using P-gp knockout mice, which was 2. 7 -fold higher than in control mice. From these data, we conclude that in mice, even at a relevant intraluminal concentration of darunavir, P-gp has a modulatory effect on the absorption of darunavir. However, this P-gp-mediated darunavir transport is inhibitedwhen it is combined with ritonavir. In the next study, we subsequently expanded our focus from darunavir to a broad series of PIs. In addition, we investigated the role of both P-gp and intestinal metabolism on their absorption. We explored the impact of ritonavir on the intestinal absorption of PIs in two models: the Caco- 2 system and the in situ intestinal perfusion model using wild-type mice. In the Caco- 2 model, the effect of ritonavir on the permeability of the other PIs was significant for saquinavir (2 -fold increase) and indinavir (3 -fold increase), negligible for darunavir and amprenavir, and nonexistent for nelfinavir, lopinavir, tipranavir, and atazanavir. However, performing the in situ intestinal perfusion technique in mice for three selected PIs showed a significant increase in the intestinal permeability for all: indinavir (3. 2 -fold), lopinavir (2. 3 -fold), and darunavir (3 -fold). The effect of aminobenzotriazole (anonspecific P 450 inhibitor) on lopinavir permeability was comparable with using ritonavir, whereas there was no effect for indinavir and darunavir. We conclude that ritonavir can boost drug absorption by inhibiting P-glycoprotein and/or metabolism, in a compound-specific manner. Because the dual effect of ritonavir on metabolism and transporter inhibition could only be observed in a system co-expressing both, the Caco- 2 model might be insufficient when studying drug-drug interactions at the level of the intestinal mucosa. In the third study, we evaluated the use of humanized mice in the in situ intestinal perfusion technique. Humanized mice hold great promise to overcome species differences between rodents and humans. Conventional rodent models are less suitable for predicting drug-drug interactions at the level of the human intestinal mucosa, especially when nuclear receptors like pregnane X receptor (PXR) are involved. Recently, a transgenic mouse model, expressing both human PXR and CYP 3 A 4, was developed and shown to be a better predictor of CYP 3 A 4 induction by xenobiotics in humans compared to wild-type mice. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that this mouse model can also predict PXR-mediated induction of intestinal P-gp in humans. By use of the in situ intestinal perfusion technique with mesenteric blood sampling, the effect of oral rifampicin treatment on the intestinal permeability for darunavir was investigated. Rifampicin treatment lowered the intestinal permeability for darunavir by 50 % compared to non-treated mice. The P-gp inhibitor GF 120918 increased the permeability for darunavir by 400 % in rifampicin-treated mice, while this was only 56 % in mice that were not treated, thus indicating P-gp induction by rifampicin. The non-specific P 450 inhibitor aminobenzotriazole (100 µM) did not affect the permeability for darunavir. Quantitative Western blot analysis of the intestinal tissue showed that rifampicin treatment induced intestinal P-gp levels four-fold, while CYP 3 A 4 levels remained unchanged. Oral co-administration of rifampicin with the phytochemical sulforaphane (present in many cruciferous vegetables including broccoli) for three days increased the permeability for darunavir by 50 % compared to rifampicin treatment alone. These data show that PXR/CYP 3 A 4 -humanized mice can be used to study the inducing effects of xenobiotics on intestinal P-gp. In addition, food-drug interactions playing at the level of the intestine can be investigated. In the last study, we explore a novel combination of human intestinal fluids (HIF) with the mouse in situ intestinal perfusion technique to assess food effects. Fed state conditions cannot be easily implemented in the presently available permeability tools, including the frequently used Caco- 2 system. Therefore, exploring food effects during drug development can be quite challenging. In this study, we investigated the effect of fasted and fed state conditions on the intestinal absorption of the PI indinavir using simulated and human intestinal fluids in the in situ intestinal perfusion technique in mice. Indinavirwas selected as model compound because it is very susceptible to a negative food effect in humans. Although the solubility of indinavir was 6 -fold higher in fed state human intestinal fluid (FeHIF) as compared to fasted state HIF (FaHIF), the intestinal permeation of indinavir was 22 -fold lower in FeHIF as compared to FaHIF. Dialysis experiments showed that only a small fraction of indinavir is accessiblefor absorption in FeHIF due to micellar entrapment, possibly explaining its low intestinal permeation. These findings could not be confirmed using simulated intestinal fluids. From these data, we conclude that the use of HIF in the in situ intestinal perfusion model is very promising for biorelevant absorption evaluation as it allows to directlyexplore the complex solubility/permeability interplay on drug absorption. In conclusion, the results obtained in this dissertation research using the mouse in situ intestinal perfusion technique with mesenteric blood sampling clearly show that this powerful tool holds great promise in elucidating drug absorption mechanisms, drug-drug interactions and food effects in the most biorelevant way. The possibility to use knockout and knockin (humanized) mice emphasizes the benefit of using the mouse instead of the rat in this model. status: publishe...|$|E
