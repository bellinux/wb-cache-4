40|$|Aims: This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the performance of two chromogeni cmedia designed for the isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (<b>VRE)</b> and compare them with a traditional bile-esculin medium for the isolation of <b>VRE</b> from stool samples. Methods and Results: A total of 285 stool samples were inoculated onto Chromogenic <b>VRE</b> Agar (AES <b>VRE</b> agar; AES Chemunex), chromID <b>VRE</b> (bio-Merieux) and <b>VRE</b> Agar (Oxoid) both directly and also following broth enrichment. In total 18 strains of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium were recovered, including 17 harbouring the vanA gene and one with vanB. Ondirect culture, {{the sensitivity of the}} three media was 66. 7 %, 77. 8 % and 44. 4 % and after broth enrichment 66. 7 %, 83. 3 % and 77. 8 % using AES <b>VRE</b> Agar,chromID <b>VRE</b> and Oxoid <b>VRE</b> Agar respectively. Conclusions: All three media are useful tools for the isolation of <b>VRE</b> from stool samples. AES <b>VRE</b> Agar and bioMerieux chromID <b>VRE</b> are easier to use than Oxoid <b>VRE</b> Agar due to diffusion of black coloration from the latter.

Methods: We searched PubMed and EMBASE up to May 2013 for studies reporting the prevalence of <b>VRE</b> upon admission to the ICU and performed a meta-analysis to assess rates and trends of <b>VRE</b> colonization. We calculated the prevalence of <b>VRE</b> on admission and the acquisition (colonization and/or infection) rates to estimate time trends {{and the impact of}} colonization on ensuing <b>VRE</b> infections. Findings: Across 37 studies (62, 959 patients at risk), the estimated prevalence of <b>VRE</b> on admission to the ICU was 8. 8 % (7. 1 - 10. 6). Estimates were more consistent when cultures were obtained within 24 hours from admission. The <b>VRE</b> acquisition rate was 8. 8 % (95 % CI 6. 9 - 11. 0) across 26 evaluable studies (35, 364 patients at risk). Across US studies, <b>VRE</b> acquisition rate was 10. 2 % (95 % CI 7. 7 - 13. 0) and demonstrated significant decline in annual trends.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} numerical {{predictions of}} ship manoeuvring motions {{with the help}} of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. A program applying the modular concept proposed by the Japanese ship manoeuvring mathematical modelling group (MMG) to simulate the standard manoeuvring motions of ships has been initially developed for 3 degrees of freedom manoeu- <b>vring</b> motions in deep water with regression formulae to derive the hydrodynamic derivatives of the vessels. For higher accuracy, several CFD generated derivatives had been substituted to replace the empirical ones. This allows for the prediction of the maneuve- rability of a vessel in a variety of scenarios such as shallow water with expected good results in practice, which may be significantly more time-consuming if performed using a fully CFD approach. The MOERI KVLCC 2 tanker vessel was selected as the sample ship for prediction. Model scale aligned and oblique resistance and Planar Motion Mechanism (PMM) simulations were carried out using the commercial CFD software StarCCM+. The PMM simulations included pure sway and pure yaw to obtain the linear manoeuvring derivatives required by the computational model of the program. Simulations of the standard free running manoeuvers were carried out on the vessel in deep water and compared with published results available for validation. Finally, simulations in shallow water were also presented based on the CFD results from existing publications and compared with model test results. The challenges of using a coupled CFD approach in this manner are outlined and discussed...|$|E

Reports of UVR levels within media weather forecasts {{appear to be}} well received by the public and have good potential to communicate the need for appropriate sun protection to a broad audience. This study describes provision of UVR messages by New Zealand newspapers, radio and TV stations over a 4 -year period, and examines the impact of an intervention which aimed to address media concerns about the financial costs of accessing UVR information for broadcast. Newspaper and radio presentation of UVR information increased immediately after these costs were removed; however, among radio stations it dropped in subsequent years. Among those media that were presenting UVR, this information was broadcast throughout the summer period and repeated throughout the day. Furthermore, most reports included concomitant, behavioral sun protection messages. At the final assessment (summer 2001 / 02), 66 % of radio stations, both TV channels and 48 % of newspapers reported UVR information in summertime weather reports. Efforts to further increase UVR presentation will need to address media concerns about time constraints on weather forecasts and media perceptions of poor audience demand or understanding of some UVR messages.

METHODS: Seventy-one patients referred for routine electrophysiologic testing were randomized to receive one of three intravenous treatments: placebo n = 23, 15 mg mibefradil in 15 min followed by 25 mg in 60 min (group 1, n = 24), or 35 mg mibefradil in 15 min followed by 45 mg in 60 min (group 2, n = 24). Electrophysiologic evaluations were performed prior to study drug administration and 30 min after the start of the infusion. Plasma samples were obtained {{at the start of the}} infusion and after 15, 75, and 105 min. RESULTS: Sinus node recovery time decreased significantly in Group 1 patients (- 103 ms). Corrected sinus node recovery time in group 2 patients was 68. 7 ms (P = 0. 053). Compared to placebo, mibefradil produced mild but significant slowing of conduction in group 2 patients as manifested by an increase in the AH interval of 6. 7 ms. Atrioventricular (AV) nodal refractoriness was increased, as indicated by a prolongation of the Wenckebach point in patients in both group 1 (32. 1 ms) and group 2 (32. 5 ms), compared to placebo. All adverse events were classified as mild to moderate and only one event (vasovagal attack) was considered to be treatment related. CONCLUSIONS: At plasma levels close to those found after chronic oral administration of 50 and 100 mg mibefradil, the higher dose produced an increase in corrected sinus node recovery time. Mibefradil also produced small but significant effects on AV nodal conduction and increased AV nodal refractoriness.

A hospital-wide prevalence study was performed to identify cases with <b>VRE</b> faecal colonisation. A case-control study using two randomly selected VRE-negative controls for each positive case was performed to assess risk-factors for <b>VRE</b> colonisation by univariate and multivariate analysis. <b>VRE</b> faecal colonisation was documented in 53 (14. 3 %) of 370 patients screened. Previous exposure to anti-anaerobic agents, as well as quinolones, was associated with <b>VRE</b> colonisation (p < 0. 05). The presence of an invasive device (OR 4. 8, p 0. 003) and the duration of any antimicrobial treatment before <b>VRE</b> isolation (OR 1. 2, p < 0. 001) predicted <b>VRE</b> colonisation in multivariate models.

40|$|AbstractBloodstream {{infection}} {{caused by}} vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (<b>VRE)</b> {{is associated with}} very high mortality among allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) recipients. However, it remains unclear whether <b>VRE</b> bloodstream infection directly causes mortality in the early posttransplant period or is simply a marker of poor outcome. To determine the risk factors for <b>VRE</b> bloodstream infection {{and its effect on}} outcome, we followed 92 patients screened for stool colonization by <b>VRE</b> upon admission for alloHSCT. Patient records were reviewed to determine outcomes, including mortality and microbiologic failure. Colonization by <b>VRE</b> was extremely common, occurring in 40. 2 % of patients. <b>VRE</b> bloodstream infection developed in 34. 2 % of colonized patients by day + 35, compared to 1. 8 % without <b>VRE</b> colonization (P <. 01). <b>VRE</b> bloodstream infection was associated with a significant decrement in survival and frequent microbiologic failure, despite treatment with linezolid and/or daptomycin. Five (35. 7 %) of 14 patients with <b>VRE</b> bloodstream infection had attributable mortality or contributing mortality from the infection. Strain typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified 9 different <b>VRE</b> strains among the 37 colonized patients and 5 patients with different strains recovered from the stool and the blood. In conclusion, stool screening effectively identified patients at extremely high risk for <b>VRE</b> bloodstream infection. The high mortality of <b>VRE</b> in the early posttransplant period supports the use of empiric antibiotics with activity against <b>VRE</b> during periods of fever and neutropenia in colonized patients...|$|R

40|$|In a German {{hospital}} of maximum care with approximately 1, 200 beds, {{the occurrence of}} <b>VRE</b> {{over a period of}} eight years was observed. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the temporal development and distribution side of <b>VRE</b> in different areas of the hospital (intensive care / general wards) and which factors influence the infection and the mortality rate with enterococci. All patients who were hospitalized during the period in the study hospital during their stay and had a positive detection of <b>VRE</b> were collected. For the period 1998 to 2001, a detailed evaluation was performed taking into account the smear series, colonization of the site and micro-and molecular-biological data. In this period, a total of 133 patients had proven <b>VRE.</b> The following data were recorded: age and sex of patients, colonization status (colonized / infected) and type of occupation (nosocomial / personal) of <b>VRE,</b> hospital stay, the detection station, check locations and mortality. Significant risk factors for increased detection of <b>VRE</b> presented intensive care units, conservative stations, male gender and older age. The overall length of stay and mortality in <b>VRE</b> patients compared to patients without <b>VRE</b> increases significantly. In the comparisons within the group of VRE-patients, surprising results showed. As expected, infected patients increase significantly in intensive care and operating stations, also older age was more common. In addition it was shown by multivariate analysis that also brought-in <b>VRE</b> pathogens and the female sex represent significant risk factors for infection. VRE-infected patients also showed a significantly longer hospital stay than patients colonized and reflect the cost intensity of these patients. As in similar works, <b>VRE</b> patients in the ICU were significantly older than in other wards and died significantly more often. Surprisingly it was also shown by multivariate analysis that brought-in <b>VRE</b> pathogens were a risk factor associated with a significantly increased mortality. The thesis that patients with nosocomial acquired <b>VRE</b> are in a more fragile state of health and therefore have a higher mortality was not confirmed. The nosocomial acquisition of <b>VRE</b> was more common in middle-aged patients and less frequently in patients who were older than 75 years. Overall a steady decrease of both, the hospital-acquired <b>VRE</b> and the number of brought-in <b>VRE</b> was shown. The VRE-day prevalence confirmed this positive development by a decrease. The ratio of nosocomial <b>VRE</b> cases and brought-in <b>VRE</b> cases approached, because the proportion of brought-in <b>VRE</b> cases increased over the period. The reduction of the nosocomial <b>VRE</b> cases was only partly due to the improvement of hygienic measures in the studied hospital and appears to the decreasing number of brought-in <b>VRE</b> cases in general.

We describe here an ongoing high prevalence of VanB type E. faecium in a neonatal ICU hardly to identify by routine diagnostics. Methods: During a 10 [*]months’ key period 71 E. faecium isolates including 67 vanB-type isolates from 61 patients were collected non-selectively. Vancomycin resistance was determined by different MIC methods (broth microdilution, Vitek® 2) including two Etest® protocols (McFarland 0. 5 / 2. 0. on Mueller-Hinton/Brain Heart Infusion agars). Performance of three chromogenic <b>VRE</b> agars to identify the vanB type outbreak <b>VRE</b> was evaluated (BrillianceTM <b>VRE</b> agar, chromIDTM <b>VRE</b> agar, CHROMagarTM <b>VRE).</b> Isolates were genotyped by SmaI- and CeuI-macrorestriction analysis in PFGE, plasmid profiling, vanB Southern hybridisations as well as MLST typing. Results: Majority of vanB isolates (n[*]=[*] 56, 79 %) belonged to a single ST 192 outbreak strain type showing an identical PFGE pattern and analyzed representative isolates revealed a chromosomal localization of a vanB 2 -Tn 5382 cluster type. Vancomycin MICs in cation-adjusted MH broth revealed a susceptible value of ≤ 4 [*]mg/L for 31 (55 %) of the 56 outbreak <b>VRE</b> isolates. Etest® vancomycin on MH and BHI agars revealed only two vanB <b>VRE</b> isolates with a susceptible result; in general Etest® MIC results were about 1 to 2 doubling dilutions higher than MICs assessed in broth and values after the 48 [*]h readout were 0. 5 to 1 doubling dilutions higher for vanB <b>VRE.</b> Of all vanB type <b>VRE</b> only three, three and two isolates did not grow on BrillianceTM <b>VRE</b> agar, chromIDTM <b>VRE</b> agar and CHROMagarTM <b>VRE,</b> respectively.

All hospitalized patients with <b>VRE</b> positive culture were included and followed from their diagnosis until they were negative for <b>VRE</b> or their discharge. Only the first admission for each <b>VRE</b> positive patient was included. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed to determine how <b>VRE</b> had spread. Results: A total of 315 cases of <b>VRE</b> were identified, 224 of which were isolated from rectal swabs. Vancomycin-resistant/ampicilin susceptible Enterococcus faecalis were identified in 312 isolates. PFGE was performed in 47 <b>VRE</b> isolates that presented an indistinguishable migratory profile.

From 1 (st) April 2008 to 31 (st) March 2009, all patients admitted to a surgical ICU (SICU) were put on active surveillance for <b>VRE.</b> The surveillance cultures, obtained by rectal swab, were taken on admission, weekly while staying in the SICU, and on discharge from the SICU. A total of 871 patients were screened. Among them, 34 were found to carry <b>VRE</b> before their admission to the SICU, and 47 acquired <b>VRE</b> during their stay in the SICU, five of whom developed <b>VRE</b> infections. The incidence of newly acquired <b>VRE</b> during ICU stay was 21. 9 per 1000 patient-days (95 % confidence interval [CI], 16. 4 - 29. 1). Using multivariate analysis by logistic regression, we found that the length of ICU stay was an independent risk factor for new acquisition of <b>VRE.</b> In contrast, patients with prior exposure to first-generation cephalosporin were significantly less likely to acquire <b>VRE.</b> Strategies to reduce the duration of ICU stay and prudent usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics are the keys to controlling <b>VRE</b> transmission...|$|R
40|$|Process for the Management of Patients with <b>VRE</b> Enterococci are Gram-positive {{bacteria}} that are naturally {{present in the}} intestinal tract of all people. Enterococci generally are of low pathogenicity but may cause opportunistic infections in patients who are immunocompromised or are receiving high-acuity healthcare. Vancomycin is an antibiotic to which some strains of enterococci have become resistant. These resistant strains {{are referred to as}} <b>VRE</b> and are frequently resistant to other antibiotics generally used to treat enterococcal infections. Patients can be colonised or infected with <b>VRE.</b> <b>VRE</b> infections usually occur in hospitalised patients with invasive devices in situ and recent or ongoing antibiotic treatment. In Queensland the majority of <b>VRE</b> isolates to date have been from colonised patients. The majority of <b>VRE</b> colonised patients do not develop a serious <b>VRE</b> infection. <b>VRE</b> can be transmitted by direct or indirect contact for example via: • shared patient equipment if not cleaned appropriately between patient uses. Disposable or patient dedicated equipment is preferred • hands of healthcare workers after touching an infected or colonised <b>VRE</b> patient...|$|R

40|$|In a {{recently}} published article, Peltroche-Llacsahuanga and colleagues (2) compared {{the performance of}} two chro-mogenic media, i. e., chromID <b>VRE</b> (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) and CHROMagar <b>VRE</b> (Chromagar, Paris, France). Screening 259 stool samples for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (<b>VRE),</b> they detected a total of 55 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates, 54 of them harboring a vanA resistance gene and only 1 harboring vanB. Comparing these two highly selective media, they concluded that the sen-sitivity of the test was 98. 2 %. We agree that the chromID <b>VRE</b> is highly specific for <b>VRE.</b> However, our own evaluation indi-cates a lower sensitivity of this medium.

40|$|Active {{surveillance}} {{is part of}} {{a multifaceted}} approach used {{to prevent the spread of}} vancomycin-resistant enterococci (<b>VRE).</b> The impact of fecal density, the vancomycin MIC of the isolate, and the vancomycin concentration in liquid medium on test performance are uncertain. Using fecal specimens spiked with a collection of 18 <b>VRE</b> (predominantly vanB) with a wide vancomycin MIC range, we compared the performances of commercial chromogenic agars (CHROMagar <b>VRE,</b> chromID <b>VRE,</b> Brilliance <b>VRE,</b> and <b>VRE</b> Select) and 1 liquid medium (Enterococcosel enrichment broth) for <b>VRE</b> detection. The specificity of solid media was excellent; however, the sensitivity at 48 h varied from 78 to 94 %. Screening using liquid medium was less sensitive than screening with solid media, particularly as the vancomycin content increased. Sensitivity declined (i) as the fecal <b>VRE</b> density decreased, (ii) when the media were assessed at 24 h (versus 48 h), and (iii) for isolates with a low vancomycin MIC (sensitivity, 25 to 75 % versus 100 % for isolates with vancomycin MIC of 32 mg/liter on solid medium using 106 CFU/ml of feces). Depending on local epidemiology and in particular <b>VRE</b> vancomycin MICs, the sensitivity of culture-based methods for <b>VRE</b> screening of stool or rectal specimens may be suboptimal, potentially facilitating secondary transmission...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the prevalence {{and rate of}} acquisition of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (<b>VRE)</b> among patients undergoing chronic (i. e., long-term) hemodialysis who were admitted to a tertiary care center, serial rectal cultures for <b>VRE</b> were performed at hospital admission and every 5 days until hospital discharge. A total of 7 (6 %) of the 119 patients were colonized with <b>VRE</b> at admission.
