30|$|Currently, we use {{the same}} DWT level for each object region in a single image. However, {{it is better to}} change the DWT level adaptively {{according}} to the size of object region since the permissible <b>visible</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> each object is not identical. The realization of this function is one of our future work. In our current method, when JPEG 2000 is applied for image compression, we have to calculate DWT twice; one is for image compression using 5 – 3 filter, and another one is for privacy protection using Haar bases. If these two DWTs can be unified, the process of recoverable privacy protection becomes much simpler, and the computational time will be further reduced. The development of such methods is also our future work.|$|R

40|$|A major {{hindrance}} {{to image}} segmentation tasks are {{the presence of}} specular highlights on object surfaces. Specular highlights appear on object surfaces where the specular component of reflection from illuminating light sources is so dominant that most <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> the object surface is obscured by a bright region of reflected light. Specular highlights are very common artifacts of most lighting environments and are not part <b>of</b> the intrinsic <b>visible</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> an object surface. As a result, in addition to obscuring <b>visible</b> <b>detail,</b> specular highlight regions of an image can easily deceive image understanding algorithms into interpreting these regions as separate objects or regions on an object with high albedo. Recently, a couple of approaches to identifying specular highlight regions in images of object surfaces have produced some good results using color analysis. Unfortunately these methods work only for dielectric materials (e. g. plastic, rubber etc.) and require that {{the color of the}} object be different from the color of the light source. In this paper a technique is presented exploiting the polarization properties of reflected light to identify specular highlight regions. This technique works for both dielectric and metal surfaces regardless of the color of the illuminating light source, or the color detail on the object surface. In addition to separating out diffuse and specular components of reflection, the technique presented here also as a bonus can identify whet her certain image regions correspond to a dielectric or metal object surface. Extensive experimentation will be presented for a variety of dielectric and metal surfaces, both polished and rough. Experimentation with coated surfaces using the technique presented here have not yet been studied...|$|R

Specimens: Three temporal bones were extracted from cadaveric human heads for use with small-bore UHF-MRI. Intervention: Ex vivo cadaveric temporal bone specimens were imaged using an 11. 7 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner via T 1 - and T 2 -weighted-imaging with and without contrast. Main Outcome Measure: Qualitative visualization of membranous components of the inner ear compared with reports of UHF-MRI at lower field strengths. Results: The membranous anatomy of the inner ear was superbly visualized at 11. 7 T. In the cochlea, Reissner's membrane, the scala media, and the basilar membrane were clearly shown on the scan.

40|$|Importance: Optical {{coherence}} tomography angiography (OCTA) allows visualization <b>of</b> <b>iris</b> racemose hemangioma {{course and}} its relation to the normal iris microvasculature. Objective: To describe OCTA features <b>of</b> <b>iris</b> racemose hemangioma. Design, Setting, and Participants: Descriptive, noncomparative case series at a tertiary referral center (Ocular Oncology Service of Wills Eye Hospital). Patients diagnosed with unilateral iris racemose hemangioma were included in the study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Features <b>of</b> <b>iris</b> racemose hemangioma on OCTA. Results: Four eyes of 4 patients with unilateral iris racemose hemangioma were included in the study. Mean patient age was 50 years, all patients were white, and Snellen visual acuity was 20 / 20 in each case. All eyes had sectoral iris racemose hemangioma without associated iris or ciliary body solid tumor on clinical examination and ultrasound biomicroscopy. By anterior segment OCT, the racemose hemangioma was partially visualized in all cases. By OCTA, the hemangioma was clearly visualized as a uniform large-caliber vascular tortuous loop with intense flow characteristics superimposed over small-caliber radial iris vessels against a background <b>of</b> low-signal <b>iris</b> stroma. The vascular course on OCTA resembled a light bulb filament (filament sign), arising from the peripheral <b>iris</b> (base <b>of</b> light bulb) and forming a tortuous loop on reaching its peak (midfilament) near the pupil (n[*]=[*] 3) or midzonal iris (n[*]=[*] 1), before returning to the peripheral <b>iris</b> (base <b>of</b> light bulb). Intravenous fluorescein angiography performed in 1 eye depicted the iris hemangioma; however, small-caliber radial iris vessels were more distinct on OCTA than intravenous fluorescein angiography. Conclusions and Relevance: Optical coherence tomography angiography is a noninvasive vascular imaging modality that clearly depicts the looping course <b>of</b> <b>iris</b> racemose hemangioma.

30|$|It {{has been}} shown that modern {{multipurpose}} ultrasound systems provide the capability of viewing and recording real-time grayscale images <b>of</b> the <b>iris</b> in coronal or near-coronal planes, with a clear, high-resolution view of the pupillary opening. Such imaging equipment, commonly found in a hospital’s emergency department, could be used in a fast and practical manner for many clinical scenarios in which visual access to the pupil is hindered or rendered impossible. The dynamic nature of ultrasound imaging offers the possibility to measure and monitor the pupillary diameter and determine {{the presence or absence of}} consensual PLR, an important neurological test. This technique can also be used to record the pupillary diameter versus time, thus allowing analysis <b>of</b> the fine <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> the <b>iris</b> constriction, oscillations (hippos), or relaxation for both real-time and post examination. For this purpose, the M-mode capability of the ultrasound system is used. Other probes with slimmer design and higher (up to 15  MHz) frequencies may be more practical and convenient. Testing and application of the suggested procedure in the clinical setting seems to be a promising and valuable tool.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{authentication}} {{of individuals}} using irisbased recognition {{is a widely}} developing technology. Precise and unobtrusive image acquisition is not always possible. This introduces a number of ill-affecting factors to the subsequent localisation and characterisation stages. Common problems include variations in lighting, poor image quality, noise and interference caused by eyelashes. The feature extraction and classification procedures rely heavily on the rich textural <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the <b>iris</b> to provide a unique digital signature for an individual. As a result, the stability and integrity of a system depends on effective segmentation <b>of</b> the <b>iris</b> to generate the iris-code. The previously mentioned problems hinder this task. A new segmentation method is presented to tackle these problems. Principal component analysis (PCA) is discussed as a preprocessing technique that removes redundant and useless data. Variations in lighting and noise are handled using an application of median filtering and adaptive thresholding. Finally, edge detection and the Hough transform are discussed for locating the circular boundaries of the pupil and sclera. keywords:Person Identification, Principal component analysis, Haar Transform, segmentatio...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade a new family of methods, namely Image-Based Rendering, has appeared. These {{techniques}} rely {{on the use of}} precomputed images to totally or partially substitute the geometric representation of the scene. This allows to obtain realistic renderings even with modest resources. The main problem is the amount of data needed, mainly due to the high redundancy and the high computational cost of capture. In this paper we present a new method to automatically determine the correct camera placement positions in order to obtain a minimal set of views for Image-Based Rendering. The input is a 3 D polyhedral model including textures and the output is a set of views that sample all visible polygons at an appropriate rate. The viewpoints should cover all visible polygons with an adequate quality, so that we sample the polygons at sufficient rate. This permits to avoid the excessive redundancy of the data existing in several other approaches. We also reduce the cost of the capturing process, as the number of actually computed reference views decreases. The localization of interesting viewpoints is performed with the aid of an information theory-based measure, dubbed viewpoint entropy. This measure is used to determine the amount of information seen from a viewpoint. Next we develop a greedy algorithm to minimize the number of images needed to represent a scene. In contrast to other approaches, our system uses a special preprocess for textures to avoid artifacts appearing in partially occluded textured polygons. Therefore no <b>visible</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> these images is lost.

40|$|Abstract: A new iris feature {{extraction}} approach using both spatial and frequency domain is presented. Steerable pyramid is adopted to get the orientation information on iris images.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the rise across {{acute care settings}} {{in the industrialized world}} of techniques that encourage clinicians to record their experiences about adverse events they are personally involved in; that is, to share narratives about errors, mishaps or 'critical incidents'. The paper proposes that critical incident reporting and the 'root cause' investigations it affords, are both central to the effort to involve clinicians in managing and organizing their work, and a departure from established methods and approaches to achieve clinicians' involvement in these non-clinical domains of health care. We argue that critical incident narratives render <b>visible</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the clinical work that have thus far only been discussed in closed, paperless meetings, and that, as narratives, they incite individuals to share personal experiences with parties previously excluded from knowledge about failure. Drawing on a study of 124 medical retrieval incident reports, the paper provides illustrations and interpretations of both the narrative and the meta-discursive dimensions of critical incident reporting. We suggest that, as a new and complex genre, critical incident reporting achieves three important objectives. First, it provides clinicians with a channel for dealing with incidents in a way that brings problems to light in a non-blaming way and that might therefore be morally satisfying and perhaps even therapeutic. Second, these narrations make available new spaces for the apprehension, identification and performance of self. Here, the incident report becomes a space where clinicians publicly perform concern about what happened. Third, incident reporting becomes the basis for radically altering the clinician-organization relationship. As a complex expression of clinical failure and its re-articulation into organizational meta-discourse, incident reporting puts doctors' selves and feelings at risk not just within the relative safety of personal or intra-professional relationships, but also in the normative context of organizational coordination, accountability, planning and management.

40|$|The <b>iris</b> <b>of</b> {{the eye is}} {{considered}} to be the most discriminatory of facial features. It is often assumed that an individual's iris pattem remains unchanged throughout their lifetime. However, clinical findings suggest that changes in the iris can occur due to ageing and in response to external factors such as medications, disease and surgery. Such changes in the appearance <b>of</b> the <b>iris</b> need to be addressed when considering the iris as a biometric. The extent of change over time and whether this affects the appearance <b>of</b> the <b>iris</b> sufficiently to impact on its value as a biometric measure requires investigation. To enable a <b>detailed</b> study <b>of</b> <b>iris</b> stability, a novel database <b>of</b> high resolution <b>iris</b> images is presented comprising 364 irides with images captured at regular time intervals. To facilitate iris analysis, an enhanced localisation method is proposed for iris segmentation. An extensive evaluation of a number of feature extraction algorithms is described and applied to a database <b>of</b> <b>iris</b> images captured over increasing time intervals of three, six, nine and twelve months. Irides are analysed in order to determine whether significant variation exists between images captured at increasing time lapses and {{to assess the impact of}} such variations on recognition performance. Iris matching schemes are also evaluated and compared. Results are presented in which increased dissimilarity is observed in iris comparisons as the time interval between comparisons increases. These differences increase the probability of recognition failure in iris recognition. A greater number of recognition failures are observed as the time lapse between images increases. Such failures are also found to differ depending on iris texture pattern. It is concluded that whilst the iris remains an appropriate biometric identifier, it may not be as stable as originally proposed.

Design: Cross-sectional study Participants. Congenital glaucoma patients over age of 5 years. Materials and Methods: A prospective consecutive pilot study was done in congenital glaucoma patients who were older than 5 years. Methods used are indirect gonioscopy and RetCam imaging. Clarity of the image, extent <b>of</b> angle <b>visible</b> and <b>details</b> <b>of</b> angle structures seen were graded for both methods, on digitally recorded images, in each eye, by two masked observers.

Here we report a surgical case of subependymoma occurring in the lateral ventricle and provide the first documentation of the crush cytologic features of this tumor. CASE: A 34 -year-old woman {{was found to have}} a tumorous lesion in the right lateral ventricle. At surgery, a 2 -cm-diameter tumor was detected in the anterior horn. Histologic examination during surgery revealed that the mass was composed of loose, fibrillary networks and clusters of nuclei showing mild pleomorphism. A number of microcystic formations were evident. Histologically, the neoplasm was considered benign-specifically, a subependymoma. Papanicolaou- or Giemsa-stained crush specimens and imprint smears were also prepared. The cytologic morphology was fundamentally the same as the histologic. In the crush specimens, microcystic formations were readily <b>visible.</b> Moreover, <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the cellular morphology were more easily recognized in the cytologic slides than in the frozen sections.

40|$|Goal: MRI imaging of the {{temporomandibular}} joint (TMJ) at a {{field intensity}} of 1. 5 T with surface coils {{has been an}} established method for diagnosing temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) for some years now. The use of 3. 0 T technology offers an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio and improved image quality. The goal {{of the study was}} to compare the subjective and objective image quality of the 3. 0 T MRI with that of the 1. 5 T MRI of the temporomandibular joint. Methodology: In a prospective study 20 temporomandibular joints of patients with TMD and 27 of subjects without symptoms were examined in a 1. 5 T system with a 3 -inch double surface coil and in a 3. 0 T MRI with 4 -cm surface coil on the same day. The images were analyzed independently by a radiologist and a dentist using a standardized questionnaire. One part of the analysis assessed the <b>visible</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> anatomical structures such as disk, joint surfaces, joint capsule, bilaminar zone, ligament structures, joint compartments and muscular structures and the other part assessed the subjective image quality and the signal-to-noise ratio. The results of the questionnaire were statistically evaluated with two two-factor non-parametric analyses for data with measurement repetition. Cross tabulations were used to display to what extent there was an accord of the diagnostic findings of the two MRI scanners concerning the position of the discus, the condyle morphology and the discus luxation. Results: The evaluated anatomical details could be clearly recognized in both image series. Almost 80 % of the anatomical features were evaluated significantly differently in favor of the 3. 0 T MRI, but with the other structures neither an advantage nor a disadvantage could be detected. The image quality and the SNR were also significantly better in the 3. 0 T images in the majority of cases. It turned out that there were differences in the assessments of condyle morphology, discus position and discus luxation between the MRI scanners. When a bite wedge was used to stabilize the mandible the images at maximum mouth opening were better than at the rest jaw position. Conclusion: This study shows that the view of the TMJ at 3. 0 T improves diagnostic capacity compared to 1. 5 T in the majority of cases...|$|R

Further, since the iris is an overt body, its appearance is amenable to remote examination {{with the aid of a}} machine vision system. The body <b>of</b> this paper <b>details</b> issues in the design and operation of such systems. For the sake of illustration, extant systems are described in some amount <b>of</b> <b>detail.</b> Keywords—Biometrics, <b>iris</b> recognition, machine vision, object recognition, pattern recognition...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{takes as}} a {{starting}} point, therefore, a concrete example by applying Chen and Paul's (2001) techniques of domain visualisation to a community of information systems development practitioners. In particular, this example not only makes available a series of conceptual configurations, but also allows for {{a demonstration of the}} conceptual apparatus employed. The potentially contingent nature of the concepts of actions, identities and virtual communities of practice can thus be rendered <b>visible</b> during the <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> the extended analysis. This is principally through the use of temporal frames. As a result, the salience of retrievability, in addition to visibility, as a pivotal methodological feature for tool/medium design is made apparent. Further research into comparable methods for making visible, and retrievable, the work practices of virtual communities is proposed, and the possible design implications for social domain visualisation per se are discussed.
