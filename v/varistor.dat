25|$|The name <b>varistor</b> is a {{portmanteau}} {{of varying}} resistor. The term is only used for non-ohmic varying resistors. Variable resistors, {{such as the}} potentiometer and the rheostat, have ohmic characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Multi-layer <b>varistor</b> (MLV) devices provide {{electrostatic}} discharge protection to electronic circuits from low to medium energy transients in sensitive equipment operating at 0-120 volts dc. They have peak current ratings from about 20 to 500 amperes, and peak energy ratings from 0.05 to 2.5 joules.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the <b>varistor,</b> in form of {{a new type of}} rectifier based on a cuprous oxide layer on copper, originated in the work by L.O. Grondahl and P.H. Geiger in 1927. Another form made from silicon carbide by R. O. Grisdale in the early 1930s was used to guard telephone lines from lightning.|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of degradation induced by electroplating in ZnO ceramic <b>varistors</b> was investigated. It {{was found that}} for ZnO ceramic <b>varistors</b> with dense microstructure, electroplating exerts a twofold influence on the <b>varistors.</b> Atomic hydrogen generated in electroplating reduced ZnO to Zn in {{the surface of the}} <b>varistors</b> and nickel was deposited on Zn subsequently. It was shown that hydrogen weakens the potential barrier at the grain boundaries of the <b>varistors</b> causing great increases in the leakage current and the dielectric loss of the <b>varistors.</b> Department of Applied Physic...|$|R
40|$|For ZnO-based ceramic <b>varistors,</b> it {{was found}} that the current leakage is largely {{increased}} by the reduction of hydrogen generated in nickel electroplating and electroless nickel plating. Nickel acts as a barrier to protect the silver electrode of ZnO chip <b>varistors</b> from dissolution while soldering surface mounting. Hydrogen-induced degradation also occurs in in-service ZnO-based <b>varistors</b> when hydrogen is generated by the electrolysis of water condensed from environmental moisture. In this study, we investigated hydrogen-induced degradation in SrTiO 3 -based ceramic <b>varistors,</b> which shows that the ambient-temperature reduction of hydrogen is also an important cause for the degradation of SrTiO 3 -based ceramic <b>varistors...</b>|$|R

Details of the apparatus, its evaluation and application to standard resistors as well as commercially available <b>varistors</b> are presented in this paper. The non linear coefficient ct of the <b>varistors</b> has been measured and is found to vary between 29 - 66 for <b>varistors</b> ranging from 40 - 150 V...|$|R
25|$|A <b>varistor</b> is an {{electronic}} component with an electrical resistance that {{varies with the}} applied voltage. Also known as a voltage-dependent resistor (VDR), it has a nonlinear, non-ohmic current–voltage characteristic {{that is similar to}} that of a diode. In contrast to a diode however, it has the same characteristic for both directions of traversing current. At low voltage it has a high electrical resistance which decreases as the voltage is raised.|$|E
25|$|A <b>varistor</b> {{provides}} no equipment protection from inrush current surges (during equipment startup), from overcurrent (created {{by a short}} circuit), or from voltage sags (also known as a brownout); it neither senses nor affects such events. Susceptibility of electronic equipment to these other power disturbances is defined by {{other aspects of the}} system design, either inside the equipment itself or externally by means such as a UPS, a voltage regulator or a surge protector with built-in overvoltage protection (which typically consists of a voltage-sensing circuit and a relay for disconnecting the AC input when the voltage reaches a danger threshold).|$|E
500|$|ZnO discs, {{acting as}} a [...] <b>varistor,</b> are the active {{material}} in most surge arresters.|$|E
2500|$|Typical {{capacitance}} for consumer-sized (7–20nbsp&mm diameter) <b>varistors</b> are in {{the range}} of 100–2,500nbsp&pF. [...] Smaller, lower-capacitance <b>varistors</b> are available with capacitance of ~1nbsp&pF for microelectronic protection, such as in cellular phones. These low-capacitance <b>varistors</b> are, however, unable to withstand large surge currents simply due to their compact PCB-mount size.|$|R
40|$|Powders used {{to produce}} zinc oxide ceramic <b>varistors</b> were prepared, by wet {{chemical}} route. SEM and XRD were used to characterize the powder properties and the microstructure of the <b>varistors.</b> It was shown that nearly spherical ZnO powders could obtain <b>varistors</b> of homogenous microstructure and help to improve its nonlinear coefficient in large current case and current surge capability. The effects of preparation technique of ZnO powders doped with Co,Mn and the additive powders on <b>varistors</b> were also studied. The microstructure of <b>varistors</b> made from the powders prepared by co-precipitation is more homogeneous and the nonlinear coefficient about 50 and high breakdown fields and large surge capability were achieved...|$|R
50|$|Typical {{capacitance}} for consumer-sized (7-20 mm diameter) <b>varistors</b> are in {{the range}} of 100-2,500 pF. Smaller, lower-capacitance <b>varistors</b> are available with capacitance of ~1 pF for microelectronic protection, such as in cellular phones. These low-capacitance <b>varistors</b> are, however, unable to withstand large surge currents simply due to their compact PCB-mount size.|$|R
2500|$|The main {{parameter}} affecting <b>varistor</b> {{life expectancy}} is its energy (Joule) rating. [...] Increasing the energy rating raises the number of (defined maximum size) transient pulses that it can accommodate exponentially {{as well as the}} cumulative sum of energy from clamping lesser pulses. [...] As these pulses occur, the [...] "clamping voltage" [...] it provides during each event decreases, and a <b>varistor</b> is typically deemed to be functionally degraded when its [...] "clamping voltage" [...] has changed by 10%. Manufacturer's life-expectancy charts relate current, severity and number of transients to make failure predictions based on the total energy dissipated {{over the life of the}} part.|$|E
2500|$|In {{consumer}} electronics, particularly surge protectors, the MOV <b>varistor</b> size employed {{is small}} enough that eventually failure is expected. Other applications, such as power transmission, use VDRs of different construction in multiple configurations engineered for long life span.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>varistor</b> remains {{non-conductive}} as a shunt-mode device during {{normal operation}} when the voltage across it remains well below its [...] "clamping voltage", thus varistors are typically used for suppressing line voltage surges. Varistors can fail {{for either of}} two reasons.|$|E
40|$|Water-induced {{degradation}} in ZnO-based ceramic <b>varistors</b> is reported. A comparison {{experiment was}} conducted in which some <b>varistors</b> were immersed in a 0. 05 M NaOH solution for some time while other <b>varistors</b> were placed in a 0. 05 M NaOH solution to evolve hydrogen on their silver electrode by electrolysis of water. No degradation occurred to those samples that were immersed in the NaOH solution; the leakage currents increased by orders of magnitude and the switch voltage remained unchanged in the samples treated by electrolysis of water. These {{results indicate that the}} degradation resulted from the reduction reaction of hydrogen atoms generated by electrolysis of water rather than the permeation of water into the ceramics. Because water can be formed on <b>varistors</b> by condensation of aqueous vapor in air and <b>varistors</b> are usually operated under electric fields, it is proposed that the reduction reaction of hydrogen atoms generated by electrolysis of water may be an important origin for the degradation in ZnO <b>varistors.</b> Department of Applied Physic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{numerical}} simulation {{is an effective}} method for researching the relationship between macroscopic properties of ZnO <b>varistors</b> and their microstructural characteristics. However, the computing efficiency {{is a big problem}} for further researches. In this paper, a quick piecewise linear method for solving the complicated nonlinear resistor networks of ZnO <b>varistors</b> is proposed, which can significantly improve the computing efficiency by a hundred times. The simulating models for the microstructural characteristics of ZnO <b>varistors</b> are improved based on actual conduction mechanism of grain boundaries. The simulations of more bulk characteristics of ZnO <b>varistors</b> become possible, such as alternating current (AC) and surge properties...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The doping {{effects of}} Cu on the {{microstructure}} and non-ohmic electrical properties of ZnO <b>varistors</b> were studied. Addition of Cu 2 O {{can enhance the}} ZnO grain growth during sintering. The SEM and EDS results revealed that the added Cu mainly distributed in the grain boundary and spinel phases of ZnO <b>varistors.</b> The Cu 2 O addition increased the both of grain and grain boundary resistances. However it decreased the non-ohmic electrical characteristics of ZnO <b>varistors,</b> {{which is a good}} agreement with similar findings on Ag 2 O additions, but contrasts to the reports of good non-ohmic electrical property which found on binary Cu doped ZnO <b>varistors...</b>|$|R
2500|$|A {{catastrophic failure}} occurs from not {{successfully}} limiting {{a very large}} surge from an event like a lightning strike, where the energy involved is many orders of magnitude greater than the <b>varistor</b> can handle. Follow-through current resulting from a strike may melt, burn, or even vaporize the <b>varistor.</b> [...] This thermal runaway {{is due to a}} lack of conformity in individual grain-boundary junctions, which leads to the failure of dominant current paths under thermal stress when the energy in a transient pulse (normally measured in joules) is too high (i.e. significantly exceeds the manufacture's [...] "Absolute Maximum Ratings"). The probability of catastrophic failure can be reduced by increasing the rating, or using specially selected MOVs in parallel.|$|E
2500|$|Good quality {{multimeters}} {{designed to}} meet CAT II and above standards include High Rupture Capacity ceramic fuses typically rated at more than 20kA capacity; [...] these are {{much less likely to}} fail explosively than more common glass fuses [...] [...] They will also include high energy overvoltage MOV (Metal Oxide <b>Varistor)</b> protection, and circuit over-current protection {{in the form of a}} Polyswitch.|$|E
2500|$|Cumulative {{degradation}} {{occurs as}} more surges happen. [...] For historical reasons, many MOVs have been incorrectly specified allowing frequent swells to also degrade capacity. [...] In this condition the <b>varistor</b> is not visibly damaged and outwardly appears functional (no catastrophic failure), but {{it no longer}} offers protection. [...] Eventually, it proceeds into a shorted circuit condition as the energy discharges create a conductive channel through the oxides.|$|E

The electrical properties of ZnO <b>varistors</b> follow, giving a detailed and up to date review of all the models published with an attempt to explain their complex conduction mechanisms. Stresses found in HV networks are also reviewed in detail, their knowledge being necessary to link the de gradation and fail ure mechanisms of ZnO <b>varistors</b> which are explained at depth. The manufacture of ZnO <b>varistors</b> on a laboratory scale is also presented: disc type as well as thick-film type <b>varistors</b> were manufactured and tested during this inv estigation. The parameters influencing the microstructure and electrical characteristics of <b>varistors</b> during sintering were reviewed.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{experiment was}} designed and carried out to study the influence of electroless nickel plating on ZnO-based ceramic <b>varistors.</b> It {{was found that the}} influence was not caused by permeation of the plating solution; the influence was directly related to nickel deposition. It is proposed that adsorbed hydrogen atoms generated in electroless plating can diffuse into ZnO ceramic <b>varistors</b> and undergo a reduction reaction with them, which result in a substantial increase in the leakage current of the <b>varistors.</b> Some implications for the influence of electroplating on I–V characteristics and for the long-term degradation of ZnO <b>varistors</b> are also discussed, in which much attention is paid to the reduction reaction of atomic hydrogen generated by electrolysis of water.

2500|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>varistor</b> is the metal-oxide <b>varistor</b> (MOV). This type {{contains}} a ceramic mass of zinc oxide grains, in a matrix of other metal oxides (such as small amounts of bismuth, cobalt, manganese) sandwiched between two metal plates (the electrodes). [...] The boundary between each grain and its neighbour forms a diode junction, which allows current to flow in only one direction. [...] The mass of randomly oriented grains is electrically equivalent to a network of back-to-back diode pairs, each pair in parallel with many other pairs. [...] When a small or moderate voltage is applied across the electrodes, only a tiny current flows, caused by reverse leakage through the diode junctions. [...] When a large voltage is applied, the diode junction breaks down due to a combination of thermionic emission and electron tunneling, and a large current flows. [...] The result of this behaviour is a highly nonlinear current-voltage characteristic, in which the MOV has a high resistance at low voltages and a low resistance at high voltages.|$|E
2500|$|Memristor {{resistance}} {{depends on}} the integral of the input applied to the terminals (rather than on the instantaneous value of the input as in a <b>varistor).</b> Since the element [...] "remembers" [...] the amount of current that last passed through, it was tagged by Chua with the name [...] "memristor". Another way of describing a memristor is as any passive two-terminal circuit element that maintains a functional relationship between the time integral of current (called charge) and the time integral of voltage (often called flux, as it is related to magnetic flux). The slope of this function is called the memristance M and is similar to variable resistance.|$|E
2500|$|To protect {{telecommunication}} lines, transient suppression {{devices such}} as 3 mil carbon blocks (IEEE C62.32), ultra-low capacitance varistors, and avalanche diodes are used. [...] For higher frequencies, such as radio communication equipment, a gas discharge tube (GDT) may be utilized. A typical surge protector power strip is built using MOVs. Low-cost versions may use only one <b>varistor,</b> from the hot (live, active) to the neutral conductor. A better protector contains at least three varistors; one across {{each of the three}} pairs of conductors. In the United States, a power strip protector should have an Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 1449 3rd edition approval so that catastrophic MOV failure does not create a fire hazard.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Through a {{conventional}} ceramic process, Y 2 O 3 and Sb 2 O 3 co-doped ZnO-based <b>varistors</b> were prepared. The microstructure and electrical {{properties of the}} as-prepared <b>varistors</b> were investigated. Y 2 O 3 could act as an inhibitor {{to the growth of}} ZnO grains when working with Sb 2 O 3. The mean size of ZnO grains in the Sb 2 O 3 and Y 2 O 3 co-doped samples was smaller than those of the samples only added with Y 2 O 3 or Sb 2 O 3. And with appropriately increased ratio of Y:Sb, it would result in increased sample densification. When the doping level of Y 2 O 3 was small, the nonlinear coefficient and breakdown voltage of the <b>varistors</b> would increase with increasing doping amounts of Y 2 O 3, and the leakage current would decrease. However, when Y 2 O 3 was doped without Sb 2 O 3, both the nonlinear coefficient and breakdown voltage of the <b>varistors</b> would decrease sharply, thus the leakage current increase dramatically. The electrical properties of the Sb 2 O 3 and Y 2 O 3 co-doped <b>varistors</b> would be better than those of the samples only added with Y 2 O 3 or Sb 2 O 3, and when the Y:Sb atom ratio was 5, the nonlinear coefficients, breakdown voltages and leakage current of the <b>varistors</b> reached their optimum values of 777 V/mm, 23 and 0. 17 mA/cm 2, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{degradation}} behaviour of SnO 2 -based <b>varistors</b> (SCNCr) due {{to current}} pulses (8 / 20 µs) is reported {{here for the}} first time in comparison with the ZnO-based commercial <b>varistors</b> (ZnO). Puncturing and/or cracking failures were observed in ZnO-based <b>varistors</b> possessing inferior thermo-mechanical properties in comparison with that found in a SCNCr system free of failures. Both systems presented electric degradation related to the increase in the leakage current and decrease in the electric breakdown field, non-linear coefficient and average value of the potential barrier height. However, it was found that a more severe degradation occurred in the ZnO-based <b>varistors</b> concerning their non-ohmic behaviour, while in the SCNCr system, a strong non-ohmic behaviour remained after the degradation. These results indicate that the degradation in the metal oxide <b>varistors</b> is controlled by a defect diffusion process whose rate depends on the mobility, the concentration of meta-stable defects and the amount of electrically active interfaces. The improved behaviour of the SCNCr system is then inferred to be associated with the higher amount of electrically active interfaces (85 %) and to a higher energy necessary to activate the diffusion of the specific defects.
