50|$|The way Thomas Aquinas viewed sin and <b>vices</b> was radically {{different}} from later approaches, especially that of 17th century moral theology.

40|$|During {{the medieval}} age {{the scheme of}} the seven <b>vices</b> constitutes, as John Bossy underlines, a sort of great {{speculum}} societatis {{in which all the}} <b>vices</b> which ingenerate social disorder, conflict and violence can be recognised. The English historian believes that, on the contrary, this system proves itself weak with reference to the psychological introspection. Various elements, however, convey the impression that the social use of the seven vices' structure never obscured the interior life of the individual. On the contrary, in a first moment the capital <b>vices</b> (as delineated by Giovanni Cassiano) are actually expression and vehicle of a solitary morality: the one of the monk, who sees in the genealogy of the seven <b>vices</b> a series of psychological conditions progressively turned towards evil and who aims to self-knowledge and self-dominion within a search of purification and of approach to God. Even when, from Gregory the Great's age onwards, the interlocutor of the moral message is all mankind and the "mundane" use of the seven <b>vices</b> is favoured by the elimination of sloth and by the introduction of envy, the system's strong social character does not lessen its individual and psychological dimension. When the individual confession of the <b>vices</b> becomes obligatory for everyone, the seven vices' structure proves to be a perfect system of individuation and classification of the various <b>vices,</b> capable of guiding the whole social body through the administration of the souls, by tracing from the external actions the interior movements which have caused them. And even if the genealogical order of the <b>vices</b> tends to turn into a taxonomic, the system does not lose its guiding function of penetrating the human soul's recesses: on the contrary, the powerful psychological analysis of the capital <b>vices,</b> previously guaranteed by the monastic knowledge, finds new strength in the suggestions that, with special reference to human passions, derive from the discovery of Greek psychology...|$|R

Yet fallacies cannot just {{be identified with}} <b>vices,</b> since <b>vices</b> are dispositional properties of agents whereas fallacies are types of argument. Rather, if the normativity of good argumentation is explicable in terms of virtues, we should expect the wrongness of bad argumentation to be explicable in terms of <b>vices.</b> This approach is de-fended through analysis of several fallacies, with particular emphasis on the ad misericordiam. 1...|$|R
