Finely divided lithium fluoride powder has been used for thermoluminescent radiation dosimetry (TLD): when a sample of such is exposed to radiation, it accumulates crystal defects which, when heated, resolve via a release of bluish light whose intensity is proportional to the absorbed dose, thus allowing this to be quantified. Lithium fluoride is sometimes used in focal lenses of telescopes.|$|E

This review focuses on the spores of various Bacillus species: (i) their mechanisms of UV resistance; (ii) their survival in unmanned spacecraft, space flight and simulated space flight and Martian conditions; (iii) the UV flux in space and on Mars; (iv) factors affecting spore survival in such high UV flux environments...|$|R
40|$|Two flight {{experiments}} {{dedicated to}} the study of the performance of materials in space have been carried out. Material samples have been exposed passively to low-Earth orbit (LEO) environment, then retrieved for laboratory study. The first experiment was conducted in the framework of the FRECOPA project and was flown on the trailing edge of the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) (exposure to <b>vacuum</b> and ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> radiation for 5. 5 years). The experiment COMES was installed outside of the MIR space station during an extravehicular activity; it was exposed to <b>vacuum,</b> O-atoms, and <b>UV</b> radiation for 1. 1 year; and it was brought back to Earth by cosmonauts. The difference in exposure conditions and the use of transparent filters protecting some samples of COMES enable to differentiate the effects of UV radiation and oxygen atoms. The degradations of several thermal control coatings (paints, metalized polymeric films with and without ITO), structural materials, and optical components have been observed, measured, and compared after these two flight experiments.

Although recent and increasingly realistic studies have concluded SPTs an unattractive option, the motivation behind this work is to progress the novel SPT concepts by resolving two problems identified: presenting a feasible solution for deployment and maintaining tight control over the collector shape; and addressing the space durability of carbon-fibre reinforced epoxy-resin composites for long duration solar sailing missions. Laterally curved bistable reeled composites were manufactured {{in such a way}} that their beneficial structural properties and bistable behaviour have been complimented with improved environmental resistance.

40|$|Depending on the {{processing}} conditions in liquid crystal (LC) display manufacturing, LC/polymer composite films may exhibit unusual properties {{with respect to}} the compositional and phase behavior of the LC constituents.

Therefore, the influence of real manufacturing conditions such as thermal stress, storage in <b>vacuum,</b> and <b>UV</b> irradiation on the nematic isotropic (n-i) transition temperatures of commercial nematic mixtures was investigated. Shifts of the clearing temperature of up to 88 K, presumably due to partial evaporation or UV degradation, were observed. Furthermore, we found that annealing may lead to the replacement of the nematic phase by the smectic A phase at room temperature in both LC/polymer composites and pure LC samples. Among the tested commercial LC blends, the mixtures E 7, MLC- 6650, and L 101 showed the smallest stress effects. Practical consequences of our results are discussed...|$|R

The resonant radiation from Xe(P- 3 (1)) dominates for 3. 5 %, while that from Xe- 2 ((3) Sigma(u) (+)) becomes dominant over Xe(P- 3 (1)) for 10 %- 30 %. Remarkably for 30 %, the intensity from Xe- 2 ((1) Sigma(u) (+)) is even larger than that from Xe(P- 3 (1)).
