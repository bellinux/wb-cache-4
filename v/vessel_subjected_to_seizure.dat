40|$|The Criminal Procedure Law Article 106 (3) {{defines as}} follows. ? When {{the object of}} seizure is {{computer}} disk, or other storage medium of similar digital information, Court should be offered {{in the form of}} a printed document or a copy of digital information only to prove the facts of suspicion. ? However, when it is acknowledged that such method is impossible or it seems hard to achieve the goal of seizure, the Court can confiscate the storage medium to save digital information. The Criminal Procedure Law Article 106 (3) makes ? a principle, and then exceptively allows court to seize the storage medium. The legislative intent is that protecting the fundamental rights of the submitting person should be respected. When the execution of warrant by an investigative agency with a way of ?, generally an investigative agency acquires digital information to prove the facts of suspicion through several stage: (?) acquiring and moving storage medium from storage medium location to an office of an investigative agency or other external sites.

In such cases, the most important two issues are: When the execution of warrant completed at step (?) or step (?) ?

40|$|Acoustic {{emissions}} (AE) {{generated from}} Kevlar 49 /epoxy composite pressure <b>vessels</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> sustained load-to-failure tests were studied.

It was found that AE from vessel wall-mounted transducers showed a wide variance from those for identical <b>vessels</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> the same pressure loading. Emissions from boss-mounted transducers did, however, yield values that were relatively consistent. It appears that the signals from the boss-mounted transducers represent an integrated average of the emissions generated by fibers fracturing during the vessel tests. The AE from boss-mounted transducers were also independent of time for vessel failure. This suggests that a similar number of fiber fractures must occur prior to initiation of vessel failure. These studies indicate a potential for developing an AE test procedure for predicting the residual service life or integrity of composite vessels...|$|R
