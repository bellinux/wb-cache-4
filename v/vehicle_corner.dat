40|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} to estimate {{the force of a}} semiactive damper, particularly of a magnetorheological damper because of its importance in automotive and civil engineering. Usually, all models have been proposed assuming experimental data in nominal operating conditions {{and some of them are}} estimated for control purposes. Because dampers are prone to fail, fault estimation is useful to design adaptive vibration controllers to accommodate the malfunction in the suspension system. This paper deals with the diagnosis and estimation of faults in an automotive magnetorheological damper. A robust LPV observer is proposed to estimate the lack of force caused by a damper leakage in a <b>vehicle</b> <b>corner.</b> Once the faulty damper is isolated in the vehicle and the fault is estimated, an Adaptive Vibration Control System is proposed to reduce the fault effect using compensation forces from the remaining healthy dampers. To fulfill the semiactive damper constraints in the fault adaptation, an LPV controller is designed for vehicle comfort and road holding. Simulation results show that the fault observer has good performance with robustness to noise and road disturbances and the proposed AVCS improves the comfort up to 24 % with respect to a controlled suspension without fault tolerance features...|$|E
40|$|Diverse vehicle {{active safety}} systems {{including}} vehicle electronic stability control (ESC) system, anti-lock braking system (ABS), and traction control system (TCS) are significantly relying on information about the vehicle's states and parameters, {{as well as the}} vehicle's surroundings. However, many important states or parameters, such as sideslip angle, tire-road friction coefficient, road gradient and vehicle mass are hard to directly measure, and hence advanced estimation algorithms are needed. Furthermore, enhancements of sensor technologies and the emergence of new concepts such as Internet of Things and their automotive version, Internet of Vehicles, facilitate reliable and resilient estimation of vehicle states and road conditions. Consequently, developing a resilient estimation structure to operate with the available sensor data in commercial vehicles and be flexible enough to incorporate new information in future cars is the main objective of this thesis. This thesis presents a reliable corner-based vehicle velocity estimation and a road condition classification algorithm. For vehicle velocity estimation, a combination of vehicle kinematics and the LuGre tire model is introduced in the design of a corner-based velocity observer. Moreover, the observability condition for both cases of time-invariant and parameter varying is studied. The effect of suspension compliance on enhancing the accuracy of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>corner</b> velocity estimation is also investigated and the results are verified via several experimental tests. The performance and the robustness of the proposed corner-based vehicle velocity estimation to model and road condition uncertainties is analyzed. The stability of the observer is discussed, and analytical expressions for the boundedness of the estimation error in the presence of system uncertainties for the case of fixed observer gains are derived. Furthermore, the stability of the observer under arbitrary and stochastic observer gain switching is studied and the performances of the observer for these two switching scenarios are compared. At the end, the sensitivity of the proposed observer to tire parameter variations is analyzed. These analyses are referred to as offline reliability methods. In addition to the off-line reliability analysis, an online reliability measure of the proposed velocity estimation is introduced, using vehicle kinematic relations. Moreover, methods to distinguish measurement faults from estimation faults are presented. Several experimental results are provided to verify the approach. An algorithm for identifying (classifying) road friction is proposed in this thesis. The analytical foundation of this algorithm, which is based on vehicle response to lateral excitation, is introduced and its performance is discussed and compared to previous approaches. The sensitivity of this algorithm to vehicle/tire parameter variations is also studied. At the end, various experimental results consisting of several maneuvers on different road conditions are presented to verify the performance of the algorithm...|$|E

The controllability-related limitations of integrated yaw rate and sideslip control, together with its potential benefits, are discussed through the tools of multi-variable feedback control theory and non-linear phase-plane analysis. Two examples of integrated yaw rate and sideslip control systems are presented and their effectiveness is experimentally evaluated and demonstrated on a four-wheel-drive fully electric vehicle prototype.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the development of}} vehicle stability control systems {{comes from the fact that}} vehicle dynamic behavior in unfavorable driving conditions such as low road-tire adhesion and high speed differs greatly from its nominal behavior. Due to this unexpected behavior, a driver may not be successful in controlling the vehicle in challenging driving situations based only on her/his everyday driving experience. Several noteworthy research works have been conducted on stability control systems over the last two decades to prevent car accidents due to human error. Most of the resultant stability controllers contain individual modules, where each perform a particular task such as yaw tracking, sideslip control, or wheel slip control. These design requirements may contradict each other in some driving scenarios. In such situations, inconsistent control actions can be generated with individual modules. The development of a stability controller that can satisfy diverse and often contradictory requirements is a great challenge. In general, transferring a control structure from one vehicle to another with a different drivetrain layout and actuation system configuration requires remarkable rectifications and repetition of tuning processes from the beginning to achieve a similar performance. This can be considered to be a serious drawback for car manufacturing companies since it results in extra effort, time, and expenses in redesigning and retuning the controller. In this thesis, an integrated controller with a modular structure has been designed to concurrently provide control of the vehicle chassis (yaw rate and sideslip control) and wheel stability (wheel slip ratio control). The proposed control structure incorporates longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics to decide on a unified control action. This control action is an outcome of solving an optimization problem that considers all the control objectives in a single cost function, so integrated wheel and vehicle stability is guaranteed. Moreover, according to the particular modular design of the proposed control structure, it can be easily reconfigured to work with different drivetrain layouts such as all-wheel-drive, front-wheel-drive, and rear-wheel-drive, as well as various actuators such as torque vectoring, differential braking, and active steering systems. The high-level control module provides a Center of Gravity (CG) based error analysis and determines the required longitudinal forces and yaw moment adjustments. The low-level control module utilizes this information to allocate control actions optimally at each <b>vehicle</b> <b>corner</b> (wheel) through a single or multi-actuator regime. In order to consider the effect of the actuator dynamics, a mathematical description of the auction system is included in distribution objective function. Therefore, a legitimate control performance is promised in situations requiring shifting from one configuration to another with minimal modifications. The performance of the proposed modular control structure is examined in simulations with a high-fidelity model of an electric GM Equinox vehicle. The high-fidelity model has been developed and provided by GM and the use of the model is to reduce the number of labor-intensive vehicle test and is to test extreme and dangerous driving conditions. Several driving scenarios with severe steering and throttle commands, then, are designed to evaluate the capability of the proposed control structure in integrated longitudinal and lateral vehicle stabilization on slippery road condition. Experimental tests also have been performed with two different electric vehicles for real-time implementation as well as validation purposes. The observations verified the performance qualifications of the proposed control structure to preserve integrated wheel and vehicle chassis stability in all track tests...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Conventionally, {{the well}} known position-velocity-acceleration (PVA) model is adopted as the dynamic model of Kalman filter for GPS positioning. However, as a moving <b>vehicle</b> <b>corners</b> at faster speeds, the {{conventional}} PVA model without using extra sensors {{can no longer}} be adequate for describing the motion of the vehicle. Thus, the positioning result of the vehicle will be less accurate, and normalized innovation squared (NIS) is not suitable as the test statistic for FDE anymore. Therefore, the delta range (DR) equation is proposed to accurately model the dynamic behavior of a maneuvering vehicle. Simulation results show that the proposed DR can perform both positioning and FDE well as the vehicle manoeuvres. Copyright © 2005 IFA...|$|R

40|$|Safety in {{automobiles}} {{is gaining}} increasing importance. With the increasing trend of U. S. buyers towards SUVs, appropriate safety measures for SUVs {{need to be}} implemented. Since SUVs, as a vehicle type, have a higher center of gravity and hence have a greater tendency to rollover at high cornering speeds. The rollover can also occur due to the vertical road inputs like bumps and potholes which induce a rolling moment. The proposed rollover identification system would "couple" the two inputs from the suspension relative position sensors and the lateral acceleration sensor to predict rollover. The input to the suspension relative position sensors could be either due to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>cornering,</b> which results in the outer suspension getting compressed and the inner suspension getting extended, or maybe due to vertical road inputs. The principal objective is to differentiate {{the two types of}} inputs (since they can have opposing moment values) and further couple the same with the lateral acceleration input to form a rollover identification system. The work involves modeling of a semi-car model using the Dymola-vehicle dynamics simulation software. The semi-car model is developed to simulate values for the two proposed sensors. Then using NHTSA standard steering procedures and steering angle as the input, the lateral tire forces are generated. These tire forces serve as input to the Dymola model which is integrated into a Simulink model. The lateral acceleration and suspension relative position sensor values obtained are then used by LabVIEW to pass judgments on the type of rollover. The model was successfully developed in Dymola. The model with steering angle as input was able to generate values of lateral acceleration and lateral tire forces. The roll angle induced due to road inputs and <b>vehicle</b> <b>cornering</b> were estimated.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge in}} electric vehicles with multiple motors {{is how to}} control the individual drivetrains {{in order to achieve}} measurable benefits in terms of <b>vehicle</b> <b>cornering</b> response, compared to conventional stability control systems actuating the friction brakes. This paper presents a direct yaw moment controller based on the combination of feedforward and feedback contributions for continuous yaw rate control. When the estimated sideslip exceeds a pre-defined threshold, a sideslip-based yaw moment contribution is activated. All yaw moment contributions are entirely tunable through model-based approaches, for reduced vehicle testing time. The purpose of the controller is to continuously modify the vehicle understeer characteristic in quasi-static conditions and increase yaw and sideslip damping during transients. Skid-pad, step-steer and sweep steer tests are carried out with a front-wheel-drive fully electric vehicle demonstrator with two independent drivetrains. The experimental test results of the electric motor-based actuation of the direct yaw moment controller are compared with those deriving from the friction brake-based actuation of the same algorithm, which is a major contribution of this paper.
