5000|$|The 1926 Olympia Motor Show premiered a new 10 kW (14 hp) tourer for ₤510. There {{was also}} another new small car in 1928, the 2060 cc (126ci) 16/40 hp Type XX and a 4-liter 29/70 hp six Type XVI, with <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo-assisted</b> <b>brakes</b> by Bosch-Dewandre.|$|R
5000|$|The 350 GT had an all-aluminium alloy V12 engine mated to a {{five-speed}} ZF manual transmission. [...] It had an aluminium body (some had steel bodies), a Salisbury differential, four-wheel independent suspension, and <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo-assisted</b> Girling disc <b>brakes</b> all round.|$|R
50|$|The 3-litre P5 car {{introduced}} in September 1958 {{was in full}} production and the obsolescent P4 range was reduced to just two cars, this new four-cylinder 80, announced on 24 October 1959 and the Rover 100 announced at the same time. The 80 engine was a new Land Rover-derived straight-4 overhead-valve engine displacing 2.3 L, entirely different from the units used in all the other models. With 80 hp (59 kW) available, the car could top 85 mph (137 km/h). Girling 10.8 in <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo-assisted</b> disc <b>brakes</b> at the front were new, and the car used wider tyres and had updated styling. Overdrive, operating on top gear only, was standard on the four-speed transmission. Options included a radio, two tone paint schemes, and either a bench or individual front seats. These options also apply to the 100 (see below).|$|R
50|$|The <b>servo-assisted</b> <b>braking</b> {{system has}} Metro {{ventilated}} discs and four-pot calipers at the front, with modified drums at the rear. The car has adjustable shock absorbers all round, and the ride height is lowered.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{transmission}} on {{the original}} car was a 4-speed manual gearbox. (overdrive and Borg-Warner Type 35 3-speed automatic transmission were options.) The monocoque body had independent suspension all-round using coil springs. The <b>servo-assisted</b> <b>brakes</b> were disc at the front and drums at the rear.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, the TR {{line was}} updated with <b>servo-assisted</b> <b>brakes</b> and a 2.5 L {{version of the}} straight-six engine {{that had been used}} in the Triumph 2000. Two {{different}} models were made: the TR250 with two Stromberg carburettors for the US market, and the TR5 with Lucas fuel injection {{for the rest of the}} world.|$|R
50|$|The chassis had rigid {{front and}} rear axles and leaf springs all round. Early cars only had brakes on the rear wheels {{operated}} by a hand lever, with a pedal-operated transmission brake acting on the propeller shaft. The footbrake system moved to drums on the rear axle in 1913. Four-wheel <b>servo-assisted</b> <b>brakes</b> became optional in 1923.|$|R
50|$|The Bedford OB was {{designed}} as a successor to the Bedford WTB. It had a wheelbase of 14 ft, and was a semi-forward control model, designed to carry 26 to 29-passenger bodywork. It was fitted with a 27.34 horsepower petrol engine, and had a four-speed manual gearbox and fully floating rear axle. The brakes were of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo-assisted</b> hydraulic type.|$|R
50|$|The chassis of the Phantom II was {{completely}} new. The front axle was mounted on semi-elliptical leaf springs as on earlier 40/50 hp models, but the rear axle was now also mounted on semi-elliptical springs instead of cantilever springs. This, {{along with the}} drivetrain changes, allowed the frame to be lower than before, improving the handling. The 4-wheel <b>servo-assisted</b> <b>brakes</b> from the Phantom I were continued, and the Bijur centralized lubrication system from the Springfield-built Phantom I was included on all Phantom II chassis.|$|R
2500|$|The SII and the SIIA {{are very}} {{difficult}} to distinguish. There were some minor cosmetic changes, but the most significant change was under the bonnet in the guise of the new 2.25-litre diesel engine. Body configurations available from the factory ranged from short-wheelbase soft-top to the top-of-the-line five-door station wagon. In 1967 a 2.6-litre inline six cylinder petrol engine was introduced for the long-wheelbase models, which also had <b>servo-assisted</b> <b>brakes.</b> [...] 811 of these were NADA (or North American Dollar Area) trucks, which were the only long-wheelbase models made for the American and Canadian markets.|$|R
50|$|<b>Servo-assisted</b> ABS <b>brakes</b> were {{ruled out}} as they would imply {{increased}} mass, complexity and reduced brake feel; however {{at the cost of}} increasing the required skill of the driver.|$|R
50|$|The car {{features}} on-board jacking and {{a one-shot}} chassis lubrication system, {{operated by a}} lever inside the driver's compartment. Independent front suspension by a coil spring-based system is complemented by a carryover semi-elliptical spring unit in the rear. The car has a 4-speed manual transmission with synchromesh on gears 2, 3 and 4. An overdrive gearbox was added in 1938,the ratio change being contained in the gearbox {{rather than in a}} separate unit. The car has 4-wheel <b>servo-assisted</b> <b>brakes</b> applied by cable (using a servo made under licence from Hispano-Suiza). The radiator shell is of Staybrite steel.|$|R
50|$|The gearbox {{was still}} three-speed with column change but an {{overdrive}} was available. As standard, the 3.3-litre cars had a three-speed column-change gearbox, with a four-speed floor-change unit as an option. Three-speed hydramatic automatic transmission was available with both engines {{but this was}} changed to the two-speed Powerglide unit {{towards the end of}} the 3.3-litre PB run. <b>Servo-assisted</b> <b>brakes,</b> with discs at the front, were fitted. Minor changes to gearing and the option of power steering were introduced early in 1965 and the PB series continued until replaced by the PC models in October of that year.|$|R
50|$|Two {{new models}} were {{launched}} in 1922 - the 11CV, with a 2-litre engine, and a badge-engineered {{version of the}} Salmson AL3, a one-litre four-cylinder powered sports car. The 11CV had a four-speed gearbox and <b>servo-assisted</b> <b>brakes.</b> The production model developed 50 bhp, but the competition version developed 70 bhp, due {{to the use of}} desmodromic valves. Only two of these competition models were built, but they were considered fast and reliable. The best competition result was a class victory at Spa-Francorchamps. The 11CV was redesigned in 1926, with an 8-valve engine featuring twin oil pumps, giving 60 bhp.|$|R
50|$|A {{facelift}} in 1990 (referred to unofficially as the Mark 2F or IIF) saw square headlights, bigger bumpers {{and a new}} interior (dash {{and door}} trim). The three different styles (hatchback, coupé hatchback and sedan) were maintained. As well as the cosmetic differences, under the skin the car received modifications to the chassis and suspension {{as well as the}} addition of <b>servo-assisted</b> <b>brakes</b> to all models including right hand drive versions. The new Polo still had the 4-cylinder engine but now as well as the carburetor 1.0 L, a fuel injection model was available with single-point injection and all engines came standard with a catalytic converter to combat tightening EU laws on automobile emissions.|$|R
50|$|In late 2002, the {{optional}} ABS system {{was replaced with}} an electrically <b>servo-assisted</b> combined <b>braking</b> system. In addition the engines were equipped with twin spark plugs on each cylinder to improve emissions and improve a persistent surging problem that affected many BMW boxer models.|$|R
5000|$|The Mk IV {{range was}} launched, not at an October motorshow, but in early 1966 with new V-format engines, the 4 having a [...] V4 and the 6 a [...] V6 unit. The {{independent}} suspension was aided by <b>servo-assisted</b> disc <b>brakes</b> on all wheels.|$|R
5000|$|The car had dual circuit, <b>servo-assisted</b> disc <b>brakes,</b> {{and most}} cars were {{supplied}} with a 3-speed automatic B & W gearbox. The exterior body panels were constructed from aluminium alloy over a Superleggera tubular steel frame. The interior was upholstered in leather {{and had a}} burled walnut dashboard.|$|R
50|$|The Series II {{launched}} in October 1960 had disc front <b>brakes,</b> <b>servo-assisted.</b> The automatic option {{was no longer}} available on the home market.|$|R
50|$|The {{tubular steel}} chassis {{was based on}} that of the GTC/4, but the {{wheelbase}} was lengthened 200 mm to 2700 mm. The bodies were steel, with a fiberglass floor; they were manufactured by Pininfarina at its Turin plant, then shipped fully finished to Modena where Ferrari assembled the cars. Suspension consisted of double wishbones, coil springs coaxial with the shock absorbers, and anti-roll bars all around; the rear axle featured an hydraulic self-levelling system.Under the bonnet there was a Tipo F 101 Colombo V12 that underwent many changes through the years. It was an alloy head and block, four overhead cams, 24-valve unit using wet sump lubrication.The transmission was conventionally coupled directly to the engine, as on the GTC/4, with a driveshaft connecting it to the rear limited slip differential. The steering was <b>servo-assisted.</b> <b>Brakes</b> were discs on all four wheels.|$|R
50|$|The ABS/EBD-featured MK20-E <b>servo-assisted</b> dual-circuit <b>brake</b> {{system is}} {{partially}} manufactured by Iranian Toklan Toos under license of Continental Teves. It is coupled to ventilated discs on front and solid discs on rear wheels. Front single-piston calipers are also manufactured by Toklan Toos under license of Lucas-TVS and rear single-piston calipers are manufactured by Girling.|$|R
50|$|A {{retractable}} radiator, deployed via a handwheel in the cockpit, {{was mounted}} under the nose. When retracted this radiator warmed {{the cockpit and}} it was claimed {{that there would be}} no need for electrically heated clothing in the open cockpit, even at 20,000 ft (6,100 m) in winter. There were air vents for cooling the cockpit in summer and also a skin-type ancillary radiator built into the upper wing centre section surface. The land undercarriage was of the single-axle type, with forward-leaning oleo legs to the lower fuselage ahead of the leading edge and rearward struts. The wheels incorporated <b>servo-assisted</b> <b>brakes</b> operated from the rudder bar. The land- and seaplane undercarriages were designed to be rapidly interchangeable and shared the same attachment points, though the oleo legs were moved aft for the floats and there were additional bracing struts forward from their feet to the fuselage. The floats, linked by a pair of horizontal struts, were duralumin with a single step and water rudder.|$|R
50|$|Alvis did {{not make}} any of the bodies for the Speed 25. The cars were {{supplied}} in chassis form and firms such as Cross & Ellis (standard tourer) Charlesworth (standard saloon and Drop Head Coupé) as well as Vanden Plas, Lancefield, Offord andothers would fit suitably elegant open touring or saloon car bodies.The car was built on a heavy steel chassis with a substantial cross brace. With its sporty low slung aspect, all-synchro gearbox, independent front suspension and <b>servo-assisted</b> <b>brakes,</b> this was a fast, reliable and beautifully made car, although at almost £1000 it was not cheap. The survival rate for what was after all a hand-built car is surprisingly good. Later models featured increased chassis boxing, and to reduce the car’s weight Alvis cut numerous holes in the chassis box sections, which was also a solution tried less successfully earlier in the decade by Mercedes-Benz when confronting the same challenge with their enormously heavy Mercedes-Benz SSKL.|$|R
5000|$|A sporty derivative, the VX4/90, {{announced}} {{separately in}} mid-October 1961 was also available. It was {{fitted with a}} twin-carburettor, alloy head, high-compression, nitrided crankshaft engine giving [...] and <b>servo-assisted</b> disc <b>brakes</b> on the front wheels. Externally the car was distinguished from the standard car by a coloured stripe down the side, revised grille and larger tail-light clusters. These cosmetic features were essentially similar to the Canadian-market-only Envoy models.|$|R
2500|$|A {{retractable}} radiator, deployed via a handwheel in the cockpit, {{was mounted}} under the nose. [...] When retracted this radiator warmed {{the cockpit and}} it was claimed {{that there would be}} no need for electrically heated clothing in the open cockpit, even at 20,000ft (6,100 m) in winter. [...] There were air vents for cooling the cockpit in summer and also a skin-type ancillary radiator built into the upper wing centre section surface. The land undercarriage was of the single-axle type, with forward-leaning oleo legs to the lower fuselage ahead of the leading edge and rearward struts. [...] The wheels incorporated <b>servo-assisted</b> <b>brakes</b> operated from the rudder bar. [...] The land- and seaplane undercarriages were designed to be rapidly interchangeable and shared the same attachment points, though the oleo legs were moved aft for the floats and there were additional bracing struts forward from their feet to the fuselage. [...] The floats, linked by a pair of horizontal struts, were duralumin with a single step and water rudder.|$|R
50|$|All models {{had gained}} air outlets {{added to the}} C-pillar for better ventilation, and a split brake circuit; while some {{features}} previously exclusive to the 124 Special such as <b>servo-assisted</b> <b>brakes,</b> back-up light and an alternator were made standard across the range. Berlina and Familiare both had a new grille with alternated chrome and black horizontal bars, and larger bumper over-riders. Additionally the Berlina had large, nearly square tail lamps made up by two stacked rectangular elements.The renewed Special sported a completely a redesigned front end. A black, square-mesh radiator grille was crossed by an horizontal bright bar joining the dual headlamps; {{each of the four}} round lamps was set in its own square, bright-edged housing. The grille-headlamps assembly was flanked by the turn indicators. Front and rear the bumpers had lost their over-riders, replaced by full-width rubber strips. At the rear the lamps were also new—still horizontal and rectangular in shape unlike the ones used on the standard saloon—and the whole tail panel was surrounded by a chromed profile.Inside there was a new dashboard with imitation wood inserts, carpets instead of rubber mats, and cloth upholstery.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspension}} set-up was unchanged {{from that}} on the Taunus TC (as improved in September 1973). The twin circuit hydraulic braking system still operated on disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear, their diameters unchanged. However, where in 1970 a buyer of the entry level 1294 cc would have found a brake servo only on the options list, <b>servo-assisted</b> <b>brakes</b> for the Taunus TC2 were standard across the range. On the six-cylinder cars, which had heavier engine blocks, it also became possible from August 1977 to specify as an option power assisted steering. [...] The range of engine sizes was the same apart from one important addition: buyers could specify an enlarged 1993 cc version of the [...] "Pinto" [...] OHC engine. It was therefore now possible to buy a 2-litre Taunus with either 4 or 6 cylinders. The four-cylinder powered car came with an advertised maximum output of [...] while the six-cylinder version offered only [...] The more recently designed four-cylinder unit also came with more torque. Nevertheless, the six-cylinder car achieved its maxima at lower engine speeds and some commentators found it more relaxing to drive.|$|R
5000|$|A 4-speed manual {{transmission}} with synchromesh on 3rd and 4th, 4-wheel leaf spring suspension, and 4-wheel <b>servo-assisted</b> mechanical <b>brakes</b> were all common with other Rolls-Royce models. The chassis was manufactured from nickel steel, and featured a [...] "double-dropped" [...] layout to gain vertical {{space for the}} axles and thus keep the profiles of the cars low. The strong chassis needed no diagonal cross-bracing, and was very light {{in comparison to the}} chassis built by its contemporary competitors, weighing in at 2510 lb in driveable form ready for delivery to the customer's chosen coachbuilder.|$|R
5000|$|The Humber was also, at launch, {{fitted with}} a high tune version of the 1,592 cc and, from September 1965, 1,725 cc {{oversquare}} engine producing [...] and [...] respectively. Early models with the 1,592 cc engine had twin single Zenith downdraught carburettors - later 1,592/1,725 cc engines used a Solex twin choke downdraught carburettor for simplicity. The twin Zenith carburettors had been hard to keep balanced. Other modifications included a water-jacketed inlet manifold, timing adjustments and stronger valve springs to eliminate valve bounce at high engine speeds. The later H120's [...] engine is a straight swap for both of these units and looks almost identical - it provides a useful boost in power to an already swift automobile. The unique Sceptre interior featured full instrumentation, including a tachometer marked up to 6,000 rpm, and a four-speed floor-mounted transmission with self-cancelling overdrive (with column-mounted control and indicator) on third and fourth gear {{for a total of}} six separate ratios in standard form. The lockout could be removed on first and second gears, and this was often done by Rootes in cars used for competitions such as rallying. In addition, the Sceptre was from the beginning provided with <b>servo-assisted</b> <b>braking</b> control and, unusually in 1963, 10-inch front disc-brakes. The Marks 1 and 1A were not available with an automatic option - although this was rectified with the Mark II cars, using a three-speed unit with automatic kick-down. This was a cheaper option than was usual at the time due to the deletion of the Laycock De Normanville overdrive fitted to the Manual cars.|$|R
25|$|May 1975 - Introduction of the Chevette three-door Hatchback in {{base and}} L model variations. Both had an {{improved}} {{version of the}} 1,256 cc OHV engine from the Viva, with a similar four-speed gearbox, rear wheel drive, independent front suspension, rack-and-pinion steering and <b>servo-assisted</b> dual circuit <b>brakes.</b> Initial standard equipment included two-speed heater fan, radial tyres, reversing lights, heated rear window and reclining front seats.|$|R
5000|$|In 1968 the 125S ("Special") {{was added}} to the range, with 100 bhp (from a {{modified}} cylinder head, camshafts, inlet/outlet manifold and Weber/Solex carburettor) and, unusually at this time, a five-speed gearbox. [...] It also had one of the worlds first intermittent wipers, halogen lights, <b>servo-assisted</b> twin circuit <b>brakes</b> and optional superlight magnesium wheels.A variety of other improvements were made including improved cabin ventilation, trim and styling.|$|R
2500|$|The {{performance}} was such in 1923, three tourers [...] "put up a passable showing" [...] {{at the first}} 24 Hours of Le Mans, leading to the creation for 1924 of the 15 Sport, with twin carburetion, larger valves, and Dewandre-Reprusseau <b>servo-assisted</b> four-wheel <b>brakes</b> (at a time when four-wheel brakes of any kind were a rarity); they ran second and third, and were comparable to the 3 litre Bentleys. The 15 CV Sport did better in 1925, winning Le Mans, followed home by a sister in third, while in 1926, Bloch and Rossignol won at an average 106km/h (66mph), leading a 1-2-3 sweep by Lorraines. Lorraine-Dietrich thus became the first marque to win Le Mans twice {{and the first to}} win in two consecutive years.|$|R
50|$|Injection engine XCKF1 (85 hp) {{replaced}} by XCKF2, with power increased to 96 hp. XC5 carburettor engine power increased to 76 hp.Thermostable Hydrovac <b>brakes</b> <b>servo-assisted</b> by a mechanical vacuum manufactured by Bendix. The Super Luxe, coupé and convertible get eight-hole wheel covers cells instead of six-hole ones. New seat pads for Grand Touring, with cloth quilted to form longitudinal ridges {{similar to the}} 404 Super Luxe. All models are given reclining front seats.|$|R
50|$|The 3.7 L (3670 cc/223 in³) engine, {{designed}} by Tadek Marek, was a double overhead cam straight-6, with cylinder head and block of cast R.R.50 aluminium alloy, a {{further development of}} the earlier engine. The engine was prone to overheating initially, but the 240 hp (179 kW) produced by the twin-SU carburettor version made buyers forgive this unfortunate trait. <b>Servo-assisted</b> disc <b>brakes</b> were fitted all round: early 11.5 in Dunlops were replaced by Girlings. The independent front suspension used ball-jointed wishbones, coil springs and rack-and-pinion steering. The live rear axle also used coil springs and was located by a Watt's linkage. The normal final-drive ratio for British and European use was 3.54:1: in the United States the ratio was usually 3.77. Customers wanting a car with an especially high top speed could choose a 3.31:1 ratio.|$|R
5000|$|The Mark IX was {{the first}} {{production}} Jaguar to offer four-wheel <b>servo-assisted</b> Dunlop disc <b>brakes</b> and recirculating ball power steering, which were now standard equipment. The brake system included a vacuum reserve tank to preserve braking {{in the event that}} the engine stalled. On models with automatic transmission, the brakes were equipped with an electromagnetic valve that maintained brake pressure at rest when the brake pedal was released to prevent the car from rolling back on an incline, hence its name [...] "Hill Holder". The Hill Holder was often troublesome (failing to release the brakes when the accelerator was depressed) and was disconnected on most cars without ill effect.|$|R
5000|$|The Rover 90 and Rover 105 were {{replaced}} by the more powerful 100 announced on 24 October 1959. Its new but similar 2.6 L IOE straight-6 engine was a short-stroke version of the P5 3-Litre unit. The 100 could reach 100 mph (161 km/h). The interior was luxurious, with wood and leather accents on traditional English car elements like a curved [...] "Shepherds Crook" [...] handbrake lever. A bench front seat or individual front seats could be ordered. A heater was a standard fitting. Like the smaller 80 version, the 100 was fitted with <b>servo-assisted</b> Girling disc <b>brakes</b> at the front, keeping drum brakes at the rear. Overdrive, on top gear only, was a standard fitting.|$|R
