40|$|On the {{background}} of seasonal and helio-geomagnetic disturbances, disturbances of the <b>ionization</b> <b>density</b> near noon connected to earthquakes are investigated. The study is performed for some tens of earthquakes with magnitudes M> 5 and depths hR=exp(M) + 150 km. The analysis is performed using data registered by the three sounding stations every hour during 30 years. Especially methods of the statistical analysis are applied to search for regularities in the lithospheric-ionospheric links before and after earthquakes. The growth of the mean <b>ionization</b> <b>density</b> N at the F-layer electron density maximum Fof 2 five-three days before earthquakes, and the decrease of N approaching the eruption and during {{a few days after}} the earthquake is investigated in dependence on both the magnitude of the earthquake M and the <b>ionization</b> <b>density</b> N near the F-layer maximum. It is found that some days before earthquakes the decrease of the <b>ionization</b> <b>density</b> &Delta;N is proportional to the values of M and N. After the earthquakes, &Delta;N depends much weaker on the magnitude M, and it is not influenced by the <b>ionization</b> <b>density</b> N.

40|$|Three {{outstanding}} {{effects of}} <b>ionization</b> <b>density</b> on the thermoluminescence (TL) mechanisms {{giving rise to}} the glow peaks of LiF:Mg,Ti (TLD- 100) are currently under investigation: (i) the dependence of the heavy charged particle (HCP) relative efficiency on <b>ionization</b> <b>density</b> {{and the effectiveness of}} its modeling by track structure theory (TST) (ii) the behavior of the TL efficiency, f(D), as a function of photon energy and dose and (iii) the shape of composite peak 5 in the glow curve for various HCP types and energies and following high dose electron irradiation. It is concluded that (i) The predictions of TST are very strongly dependent on the choice of photon energy used in the determination of f(D), (ii) Modified TST employing calculated values of f(D) at 2 keV is in agreement with 5 MeV alpha particle experimental results for composite peak 5 but underestimates the 1. 5 MeV proton relative efficiencies. Both the proton and alpha particle relative TL efficiencies of the high temperature TL (HTTL) peaks 7 and 8 are underestimated by an order of magnitude suggesting that the HTTL efficiencies are affected by other factors in addition to radial electron dose. (iii) The dose response supralinearity of peaks 7 and 8 change rapidly with photon energy: this behavior is explained in the framework of the Unified Interaction Model as due to a very strong dependence on photon energy of the relative intensity of localized recombination, (iv) The increased width and decrease in Tmax of composite peak 5 as a function of <b>ionization</b> <b>density</b> is due to the greater relative intensity of peak 5 a (a low temperature component of peak 5 arising from two-energy-transfer events which leads to localized recombination) ...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation and {{monitoring}} of the cancer risk from space radiation exposure is a crucial requirement {{for the success of}} long-term space missions. One important task in the risk calculation is to properly weigh the various components of space radiation dose according to their assumed contribution to the cancer risk relative to the risk associated with radiation of low <b>ionization</b> <b>density.</b> Currently, quality factors of radiation both on the ground and in space are defined by national and inter-national commissions based on existing radiobiological data and presumed knowledge of the <b>ionization</b> <b>density</b> distribution of the radiation field at a given point of interest. This approach makes the determination of the average quality factor of a given radiation field a rather complex task. In this contribution, we investigate the possibility to define quality factors of space radiation exposure based on nanodosimetric data. The underlying formalism of the determination of quality factors on the basis of nanodosimetric data is described, and quality factors for protons and ions (helium and carbon) of different energies based on simulated nanodosimetric data are presented.

40|$|By "polar cliff" we {{mean the}} steep {{increase}} in the <b>ionization</b> <b>density</b> observed in the morning sector of the polar ionosphere. Here the properties of this remarkable feature are investigated. The data set consists of electron density and temperature measurements obtained by the Dynamics Explorer 2 satellite. Only data recorded in the Northern Hemisphere winter are considered (solar zenith angle ≥ 90 °). We find that for moderately disturbed conditions, {{the foot of the}} polar cliff is located below 60 ° invariant latitude. Here, within about 4 °, the density increases by a factor of 4, on average. The actual location of the polar cliff depends primarily on the level of geomagnetic activity, its associated density increase on geographic longitude and altitude. As to the longitudinal variations, they are attributed to asymmetries in the background <b>ionization</b> <b>density</b> at middle latitudes. Using a superposed epoch type of averaging procedure, mean latitudinal profiles of the polar cliff and the associated electron temperature changes are derived. Since these differ significantly from those derived for the afternoon/evening sector, we conclude that the subauroral ionospheric trough does not extend into the morning sector. As to the origin of the polar cliff in the morning sector, local auroral particle precipitation should play only a secondary role...|$|R

40|$|The risk of {{internal}} exposure to 137 Cs, 134 Cs, and 131 I {{is of great}} public concern after the accident at the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE, defined herein as effectiveness {{of internal}} exposure relative to the external exposure to c-rays) is occasionally believed to be much greater than unity due to insufficient discussions on the difference of their microdosimetric profiles. We therefore performed a Monte Carlo particle transport simulation in ideally aligned cell systems to calculate the probability densities of absorbed doses in subcellular and intranuclear scales for internal exposures to electrons emitted from 137 Cs, 134 Cs, and 131 I, {{as well as the}} external exposure to 662 keV photons. The RBE due to the inhomogeneous radioactive isotope (RI) distribution in subcellular structures and the high <b>ionization</b> <b>density</b> around the particle trajectories was then derived from the calculated microdosimetric probability density. The RBE for the bystander effect was also estimated from the probability density, considering its non-linear dose response. The RBE due to the high <b>ionization</b> <b>density</b> and that for the bystander effect were very close to 1, because the microdosimetric probability densities were nearly identical between the internal exposures and the external exposure from the 662 keV photons. On the other hand, the RBE due to the RI inhomogeneity largely depended on the intranuclear RI concentration and cell size, but their maximum possible RBE was only 1. 04 even under conservative assumptions. Thus, it can be concluded from the microdosimetric viewpoint that the risk from internal exposures to 137 Cs, 134 Cs, and 131 I should be nearly equivalent to tha...|$|R

40|$|A {{quality control}} system {{especially}} designed for dosimetry in scanning proton beams {{has been designed}} and tested. The system consists of a scintillating screen (Gd 2 O 2 S:Tb), mounted at the beam-exit side of a phantom, and observed by a low noise CCD camera with a long integration time. The purpose of the instrument {{is to make a}} fast and accurate two-dimensional image of the dose distribution at the screen position in the phantom. The linearity of the signal with the dose, the noise in the signal, the influence of the <b>ionization</b> <b>density</b> on the signal, and the influence of the field size on the signal have been investigated. The spatial resolution is 1. 3 mm (1 s. d.), which is sufficiently smaller than typical penumbras in dose distributions, The measured yield depends linearly on the dose and agrees within 5 % with the calculations. In the images a signal to noise ration (signal/l s. d.) of 10 (2) has been found, which is in the same order of magnitude as expected from the calculations. At locations in the dose distribution possessing a strong contribution of high <b>ionization</b> <b>densities</b> (i. e., in the Bragg peak), we found some quenching of the light output, which can be described well by existing models if the beam characteristics are known. For clinically used beam characteristics such as a Spread Out Bragg peak, there is at most 8 % deviation from the NACP ionization chamber measurements. The conclusion is that this instrument is a useful tool for quick and reliable quality control of proton beams. The long integration-time capabilities of the system make it worthwhile to investigate its applicability in scanning proton beams and other dynamic treatment modalities.

40|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} used in {{attempting}} to kill tumor cells by inducing DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), the most critical DNA lesions. Recent and planned radiation therapy strategies use high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation to effectively treat malignant tumors. The aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} mechanisms of DNA DSB induction and repair after exposure to ionizing radiation of different <b>ionization</b> <b>densities,</b> with focus on the role of DNA damage clustering and chromatin structure, as well as the activation of repair-related proteins at clustered damage sites in human cells. DSB induction was assessed after exposure to accelerated ions of different <b>ionization</b> <b>densities</b> with LET ranging from 40 eV/nm to 300 eV/nm. Exposure of human cells to high-LET radiation resulted in clustering of DSB, leading to an excess of small DNA fragments (< 1 Mbp), as measured by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Importantly, it was found that DNA organization into chromatin fibers and higher-order structures is responsible for most of DSB clustering induced by high-LET radiation. A newly developed cold lysis protocol for preparation of genomic DNA, which avoids release of heat-labile sites (HLS) into DSB at elevated temperatures, was used to accurately measure the DSB number. DSB yields and relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values were strongly influenced by chromatin compactness. Furthermore, the presence of HLS had a substantial impact on DSB induction yields and DSB rejoining rates measured by PFGE. The lesions involved in the release of HLS into DSB were repaired independent of DNA-PKcs, XRCC 1 or PARP- 1. Moreover, cells with defect or inhibited function of DNA-PKcs did not show any fast rejoining of DSB when HLS were eliminated. The substructure and spatial dynamics of DNA damage and repair along high-LET particle tracks was monitored by immunofluorescence. Interestingly, high-LET ion track irradiation revealed one of the earliest responses to ionizing radiation, ATM phosphorylation at Ser 1981, as pATM foci that clearly correlated with gamma-H 2 AX foci within particle tracks, as well as punctuated/diffuse staining dispersed throughout the whole nucleoplasm, far away from DSB. In addition, the number of gamma-H 2 AX foci detected at early time-points was independent of the number of DSB, indicating that a single gamma-H 2 AX focus contains clusters of several DSB within 1 - 2 Mbp of chromatin. In summary, the presented data show that DSB yields and distributions are greatly influenced by <b>ionization</b> <b>density</b> and chromatin compactness. Clustering of DSB and other DNA lesions may affect the reparability. Furthermore, detection of protein activation in single cells after ion track irradiation suggested that chromatin changes or other signalling processes might take place at distance from DSB. This thesis provides new insights on the importance of the chromatin organization and the repair of clustered DNA damage sites, as well as the role of repair-associated proteins in DNA damage recognition after high-LET radiation...|$|R
