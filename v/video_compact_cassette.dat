50|$|Video 2000 (also {{known as}} V2000, with the tape {{standard}} <b>Video</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette,</b> or VCC) is a consumer videocassette system and analogue recording standard developed by Philips and Grundig {{to compete with}} JVC's VHS and Sony's Betamax video technologies. Designed for the PAL colour television standard (some models additionally handled SECAM), distribution of Video 2000 products began in 1979 exclusively in Europe, South Africa and Argentina and ended in 1988.|$|E

50|$|The DA-88 was a digitalmultitrack {{recording}} device {{introduced by the}} TASCAM division of the TEAC Corporation in 1993. This modular, digital multitrack device uses tape as the recording medium and could record up to eight tracks simultaneously. It also allowed multiple DA-88 devices to be combined to record 16 or more tracks. The first models in the series (the TASCAM DA-88, DA-38, DA-98 and Sony PCM-800) recorded at 16-bit resolution. TASCAM later introduced the DA-98HR and DA-78HR, which recorded at 24-bit resolution. Audio data was stored in the DTRS (Digital Tape Recording System) format on Hi-8mm <b>video</b> <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes,</b> allowing up to 108 minutes of continuous recording on a single tape.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, Funai {{launched}} a sales and manufacturing subsidiary in Germany. Funai also developed the <b>Compact</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Cassette</b> (CVC) format {{in the same}} year, a joint development with Technicolor, trying to compete with VHS and Betamax. Sales were poor and not well-received due to ongoing VHS vs. Beta war, and the CVC format was abandoned a few years later.|$|R
5|$|In 1979, Muntz {{decided to}} sell blank tapes and VCRs as loss leaders to attract {{customers}} to his showroom, where he would then try to sell them his projection TV systems. His success continued through the early 1980s until he invested heavily in the Technicolor <b>Compact</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Cassette</b> (CVC), a 1/4in(0.6cm) system designed to compete with Betamax, VHS, and the Super 8 film home-movie system. The CVC format failed in the marketplace, sales quickly eroded, and Muntz's store closed soon after.|$|R
50|$|<b>Compact</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Cassette</b> (CVC) {{was one of}} {{the first}} analog {{recording}} videocassette formats to use a tape smaller than its earlier predecessors of VHS and Betamax, and was developed by Funai Electronics of Japan for portable use. The first model of VCR for the format was the Model 212, introduced in 1980 by both Funai and Technicolor as they had created a joint venture to manufacture and introduce the format to the home movie market. The system, which included the VCR and a hand held video camera, was very small and lightweight for its time.|$|R
40|$|It is {{proposed}} {{to carry out}} slitless spectroscopy at ultraviolet wavelengths from orbit of meteoric debris associated with comets. The Eta Aquarid and Orionid/Halley and the Perseid/ 1962 862 Swift-Tuttle showers would be principal targets. Low light level, ultraviolet video technique will be used during night side of the orbit in a wide field, earthward viewing mode. Data will be stored in <b>compact</b> <b>video</b> <b>cassette</b> recorders. The experiment may be configured as a GAS package or in the HITCHHIKER mode. The latter would allow flexible pointing capability beyond that offered by shuttle orientation of the GAS package, and doubling of the data record. The 1100 to 3200 A spectral region should show emissions of atomic, ionic, and molecular species of interest on cometary and solar system studies...|$|R
50|$|Philips' {{development}} of the <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> in 1963 and Sony's {{development of}} the Walkman in 1979 led to widespread consumer use of magnetic audio tape. In 1990, the <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> was the dominant format in mass-market recorded music. The development of Dolby noise reduction technology in the 1960s brought audiophile quality recording to the <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> also contributing to its popularity.|$|R
50|$|The {{system is}} {{technically}} sound, but a nearly complete {{failure in the}} marketplace, with a very low take-up by a few audiophiles only. Apart from {{the problem of the}} bulky cassettes, the performance of <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes</b> had improved dramatically with the use of new materials such as chromium dioxide, Dolby B noise reduction, and better manufacturing quality. For most people, the quality of <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes</b> was adequate, and the benefits of the expensive Elcaset system limited. Audiophiles turned away from Elcaset and towards high-end <b>compact</b> <b>cassette</b> decks from companies like Nakamichi, which began making very high-quality tape decks using the <b>compact</b> audio <b>cassette</b> in late 1973, even three years before the Elcaset was released. The tapes they made could be played on any <b>compact</b> <b>cassette</b> machine. Also, the Elcaset machines were expensive. Elcaset began a fast fade-out in 1978.|$|R
50|$|The {{cassette}} itself looks {{similar to}} a <b>compact</b> <b>cassette,</b> only larger—about twice the size. Like the earlier RCA tape cartridge, it contained 6 mm (0.25 in) tape running at 9.5 cm/s (3.75 in/s), twice the width and twice {{the speed of a}} <b>compact</b> <b>cassette,</b> providing greater frequency response and dynamic range with lower high-frequency noise than the <b>compact</b> <b>cassette.</b> Another notable difference from <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes</b> is that the tape is withdrawn from the cassette when run through the transport mechanism so that the manufacturing tolerances of the cassette shell will not affect sound quality. The top-of-the-line Elcaset decks also have all the features of deluxe open-reel decks, such as separate heads for erasing, recording, and playback; remote control, and heavy-duty transports for low wow & flutter.|$|R

Sony introduced the MiniDisc format in 1992 as an alternative to Philips DCC or Digital <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> and as a successor to the <b>compact</b> <b>cassette.</b> Since the introduction of MiniDisc, Sony has attempted to promote its own audio compression technologies under the ATRAC brand, against the more widely used MP3. Until late 2004, Sony's Network Walkman line of digital portable music players did not support the MP3 standard natively.|$|R

5000|$|DCCs {{are similar}} to <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes,</b> except {{that there are no}} [...] "bulges" [...] where the tape-access holes are located. The top side of a DCC is flat and there are no access holes for the hubs on there (they are not {{required}} because auto-reverse is a standard feature on all DCC decks), so this side can be used for a bigger label than can be used on an analog <b>compact</b> <b>cassette.</b> A spring-loaded metal shutter similar to the shutters on 3.5 inch floppy disks and MiniDiscs covers the tape access holes and locks the hubs while the cassette is not in use. Cassettes provide several extra holes and indentations so that DCC recorders can tell a DCC apart from an analog <b>compact</b> <b>cassette,</b> and so they can tell what the length of a DCC tape is. Also, there is a sliding marker on the DCC to enable and disable recording. Unlike the break-away notches on analog <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes</b> and VHS tapes, this marker makes it easier to make a tape recordable again, and unlike on analog <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes,</b> the marker protects the entire tape rather than just one side.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> was {{a popular}} medium for distributing {{pre-recorded}} music in the late 1970s through to the 1990s. The very first [...] "Compact Cassette" [...] was introduced by Philips in August 1963 {{in the form of}} a prototype. <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassettes</b> became especially popular during the 1980s after the advent of the Sony Walkman, which allowed the person to control what they listened to. The Walkman was convenient because of its size, the device could fit in most pockets and often came equipped with a clip for belts or pants. <b>Compact</b> <b>cassettes</b> also saw the creation of mixtapes, which are tapes containing a compilation of songs created by any average listener of music. The songs on a mixtape generally relate to one another in some way, whether it be a conceptual theme or an overall sound. The <b>compact</b> <b>cassette</b> used double-sided magnetic tape to distribute music for commercial sale. The music is recorded on both the [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] side of the tape, with cassette being [...] "turned" [...] to play the other side of the album. <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassettes</b> were also a popular way for musicians to record [...] "Demos" [...] or [...] "Demo Tapes" [...] of their music to distribute to various record labels, in the hopes of acquiring a recording contract. The sales of <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassettes</b> eventually began to decline in the 1990s, after the release and distribution Compact Discs. After the introduction of Compact discs, the term [...] "Mixtape" [...] began to apply to any personal compilation of songs on any given format. Recently there has been a revival of <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassettes</b> by independent record labels and DIY musicians who prefer the format because of its difficulty to share over the internet.|$|R
