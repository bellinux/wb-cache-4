2500|$|Under {{steady state}} flow {{conditions}} (e.g. no flood wave), {{open channel flow}} can be subdivided into three types of flow: uniform flow, gradually varying flow, and rapidly varying flow. [...] Uniform flow describes a situation where flow depth does not change with distance along the channel. [...] This can only occur in a smooth channel that does not experience any changes in flow, channel geometry, roughness or channel slope. [...] During uniform flow, the flow depth is known as normal depth (yn). [...] This depth {{is analogous to the}} terminal velocity of an object in free fall, where gravity and frictional forces are in balance (Moglen, 2013). [...] Typically, this depth is calculated using the Manning formula. [...] Gradually <b>varied</b> <b>flow</b> occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is very small. [...] In this case, hydrostatic relationships developed for uniform flow still apply. [...] Examples of this include the backwater behind an in-stream structure (e.g. dam, sluice gate, weir, etc.), when there is a constriction in the channel, and when there is a minor change in channel slope. [...] Rapidly <b>varied</b> <b>flow</b> occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is significant. In this case, hydrostatics relationships are not appropriate for analytical solutions, and continuity of momentum must be employed. [...] Examples of this include large changes in slope like a spillway, abrupt constriction/expansion of flow, or a hydraulic jump.|$|E

[...] In the mild reach, the hydraulic jump occurs downstream of the gate, but in the steep reach, the hydraulic jump occurs upstream of the gate.

Two-dimensional vertical Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations {{were used to}} simulate the flow. They were solved with the SIMPLE algorithm of the finite difference method using the Marker and Cell technique to trace free surface movement. The dam-break flow (water column collapse) problem on a horizontal and frictionless bottom was investigated as a test case. The mechanics of dam-break flow for wet and dry bed conditions was analyzed {{on the basis of}} numerical simulations. The obtained results are shown for varying head of water in the downstream channel.

For optimal operation, the solution {{level in the}} high temperature generator should be kept constant. However, a sensor for measuring continuous level is not available because of varying solution concentration.

In the study, inverter frequencies are estimated from a dynamic simulation model and pump performance. Designed frequencies are compared with those implemented in real chillers. It {{was found that the}} frequencies used in real chillers are larger than those needed in circulation flow rates. It was intended to prevent system shut-off caused by dry-out.
