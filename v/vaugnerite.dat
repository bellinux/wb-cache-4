40|$|We report mineral textures, {{geochemistry}} and age {{relations of}} two ultrapotassic dykes from a dyke swarm in the Western {{part of the}} Moldanubian Zone at contact to the Teplá-Barrandian Block. The dykes have orientation almost perpendicular to the NNE–SSW trending Central Bohemian plutonic complex and cross cut metamorphic foliation in basement gneisses and migmatites. Based on mineral compositions and geochemistry, the dykes show close relations to Mg-K syenite plutons in the Moldanubian Zone. The two dykes are <b>vaugnerite</b> and syenite in compositions and contain talc pseudomorphs after olivine within a fine-grained matrix that consists of K-feldspar, phlogopite with small amounts of clinopyroxene and accessory quartz, apatite, titanite and sulphides of Fe, Cu, Ni. The syenite porphyry dyke cross cuts the <b>vaugnerite.</b> It contains quartz phenocrysts and comparing to <b>vaugnerite</b> has lower modal content of talc pseudomorphs. The <b>vaugnerite</b> and syenite porphyry have high K 2 O (6 to 7 wt. ...|$|E
40|$|Basic to {{intermediate}} high-K, high-Mg mantle-derived rocks occur throughout the Iberian Massif and {{are particularly important}} in the Tormes Dome, where vaugnerites form several stocks and small plutons. One {{of the largest and}} geochemically most variable among these plutons is the Calzadilla pluton in the Tormes Dome that crystallized at 318 ± 1. 4 Ma (Bashkirian; U-Pb TIMS zircon). This age reveals that the <b>vaugnerite</b> pluton was emplaced during the transition from late D 2 extensional deformation to early D 3 contractional deformation (319 to 317 Ma). Large-scale extension in the area resulted, on one hand, in extensive anatexis in the crust due to quasiisothermal decompression and mica-dehydration melting and, on the other hand, in the upwelling of the mantle, which induced partial melting of the enriched domains in the lithospheric mantle. The driving reason why crustal and mantle melts were coeval is extension. The U-Pb ID-TIMS age of allanite is not related to the emplacement nor cooling of the Calzadilla <b>vaugnerite,</b> but it seems to be related to a younger subsolidus overprint ca. 275 Ma that, in the scale of the Central Iberian Zone, corresponds to a period of hydrothermal alteration, including episyenite formation and tungsten mineralization...|$|E
40|$|Early post-collision Variscan {{magmatism}} in Corsica, France was characterised by high-K granitic intrusions of Namurian age. They {{consist of}} quartz-monzonites, monzogranites and leuco-monzogranites associated with <b>vaugnerite</b> (meladiorites or hornblende–biotite diorites) intrusive stocks and enclaves. The {{composition of the}} vaugnerites shows that they originated from slowly cooled syn-magmatically amphibolitized lamprophyric magmas probably derived from enriched mantle melts that were injected into the lower crust and contributed to its extensive anatexis giving the high-K granitic melts. Deep-seated interactions between felsic and mafic magmas {{were responsible for the}} common characteristics of both magma suites. The granitoid suite is characterised by: high K and Mg contents; relatively high concentrations of Th, Rb, Sr and Ba; (La/Yb) N from 10 to 20; LREE enrichments (LaN≈ 100 – 300); Sri≈ 0. 707; δ 18 O≈ 6; εNd≈− 3. 5 to − 2. 5. The Mg-rich minerals of the high-K plutonic suite and the vaugnerites constrain emplacement conditions to: 270 ± 100 MPa (Al-in-hornblende geobarometer), 675 ± 25 °C (solidus temperature), logfO 2 ≈− 16 and H 2 O contents in the range 3 – 4 wt. %. K-rich magmatism of Carboniferous age mostly occurs in two parallel belts in the high grade zones of the Variscan orogen. It is interpreted as resulting from continental crust–mantle interactions under high-pressure conditions (≈ 1. 5 GPa). The chemical evolution of post-collision plutonism is explained in terms of mantle–crust interactions at decreasing depths during post-orogenic extension...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe late {{stages of}} the Variscan orogeny are {{characterized}} by middle to lower crustal melting and intrusion of voluminous granitoids throughout the belt, which makes it akin to “hot” orogens. These processes resulted {{in the development of}} large granite–migmatite complexes, the largest of which being the 305 – 300 -Ma-old Velay dome in the eastern French Massif Central (FMC). This area also hosts a wide range of late-Variscan plutonic rocks that can be subdivided into four groups: (i) cordierite-bearing peraluminous granites (CPG); (ii) muscovite-bearing peraluminous granites (MPG); (iii) K-feldspar porphyritic, calc-alkaline granitoids (KCG) and (iv) Mg–K-rich (monzo) diorites and lamprophyres (“vaugnerites”). New results of LA-SF-ICP-MS U–Pb zircon and monazite dating on 33 samples from all groups indicate that both granites and mafic rocks emplaced together {{over a long period of}} ~ 40 million years throughout the Carboniferous, as shown by intrusion ages between 337. 4 ± 1. 0 and 298. 9 ± 1. 8 Ma for the granitoids, and between 335. 7 ± 2. 1 and 299. 1 ± 1. 3 Ma for the <b>vaugnerites.</b> Low zircon saturation temperatures and abundant inherited zircons with predominant late Ediacaran to early Cambrian ages indicate that the CPG and MPG formed through muscovite or biotite dehydration melting of ortho- and paragneisses from the Lower Gneiss Unit. The KCG and <b>vaugnerites</b> contain very few inherited zircons, if any, suggesting higher magma temperatures and consistent with a metasomatized lithospheric mantle source for the <b>vaugnerites.</b> The KCG can be explained by interactions between the CPG/MPG and the <b>vaugnerites,</b> or extensive differentiation of the latter. The new dataset provides clear evidence that the eastern FMC was affected by a long-lived magmatic episode characterized by coeval melting of both crustal and mantle sources. This feature is suggested here to result from a lithospheric-scale thermal anomaly, triggered by the removal of the lithospheric mantle root. The spatial distribution of the dated samples points to a progressive southward delamination of the lithospheric mantle, perhaps in response to rollback following continental subduction, or to “retro-delamination” owing to the retreat of a south-verging subduction zone...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMg-K mafic {{intrusive}} rocks are commonly observed {{during the late}} stages {{of the evolution of}} orogenic belts. The Variscan French Massif Central has many outcrops of these rocks, locally called <b>vaugnerites.</b> Such magmas have a mantle-derived origin and therefore allow discussion of the role of mantle melting and crust-mantle interactions during late-orogenic processes. In the Southern Velay area of the French Massif Central, LA-ICPMS U-Pb dating on zircons and monazites from three <b>vaugnerites</b> and four coeval granites reveals that the two igneous suites formed simultaneously, at c. 305 Ma. This major igneous event followed after an early, protracted melting stage that lasted for 20 - 30 My and generated mig- matites, but the melt was not extracted efficiently and therefore no granite plutons were formed. This demonstrates that widespread crustal anatexis, melt extraction and granite production were synchronous with the intrusion of vaugneritic mantle-derived melts in the crust. The rapid heating and subsequent melting of the crust led to upward flow of partially molten rocks, doming and collapse of the belt...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEarth's {{continental}} {{crust is}} dominantly made of buoyant, felsic igneous material (granitoids), that were ultimately {{extracted from the}} mantle {{as a result of}} Earth's differentiation. Since felsic melts are not in chemical equilibrium with the mantle, they can originate either from melting of older crustal lithologies, or from differentiation of a primitive mantle melt; only the latter case will contribute to crustal growth. To understand the mechanisms of continental crust growth and differentiation through time, it is therefore necessary to unravel the respective contribution of these two different mechanisms in the genesis of granitoid suites. In modern Earth, granitoids are chiefly generated in convergent plate boundaries (subduction and collision). This paper examines the granitic suites in a late-collision environment, the Variscan French Massif Central (FMC), and compares them with the suites found in an oceanic arc. We therefore describe, and compare, two end-members sites of granite generation. In the FMC, several main types of granites are described. Muscovite and Cordierite bearing Peraluminous Granites (resp. MPG and CPG) contain large amounts of inherited zircons, and their chemistry demonstrates that their sources were older crustal material (resp. Metasediments and metaigneous). On the other hand, Potassic Calc-alkaline Granites (KCG), associated to potassic diorites (<b>vaugnerites)</b> do not contain inherited zircons, and ultimately derive from the <b>vaugnerites.</b> The <b>vaugnerites</b> in turns form by partial melting of a mantle contaminated by the regional crust. Therefore, although they are isotopically similar to the crust, the KCG are net contributors to crustal growth. Thus we conclude that although late-orogenic settings are dominated by crustal melting and recycling, they may be sites of net crustal growth, even though this is not visible from isotopes only. In contrast, arc granitoids are purely or almost purely mantle derived. However, the preservation potential of arcs is much smaller than the preservation of late-orogenic domains, such that at the scale of a whole orogenic belt, late-orogenic magmatism is probably as important as arc magmatism. Finally, we speculate that the situation may have been similar in the Archaean, or even more skewed towards late-orogenic sites (or similar environments, dominated by melting of a altered mafic protocrust), owing to the hotter mantle and less stable subductions during that period...|$|R
40|$|In certain {{peripheral}} {{zones of}} the Anatectic Tormes Dome {{there exists a}} group of rocks, which are from basic to acid as well as rich in alkali feldspar, apatite and allanite. Such an unusual mineralogy makes the rocks to be enriched in K 20, P 2 O 5, LREE and other elements of low ionic potential. Their geochemical signature {{is related to the}} volcanic shoshonites, to the <b>vaugnerites</b> of the French Central Massif {{as well as to the}} monzonitic series of Ballon, being, in turn, almost exceptional in the iberian variscan. The least evolved terms are rather fractionated, therefore, they are not primary melts. During the differentiation, the saturation of accessory phases such as apatite, allanite and zircon exerts an important effect in the evolution of the residual liquid giving rise to an inflection point in the Harker diagrams. From the good adjustments obtained in mass balance and Rayleigh fractionation modelling, we can infer that the process of fractional crystallization is the dominant one. In this respect, the porphyritic granitoids can be derived from a liquid of monzodioritic composition, being rocks genetically to the associated acid rocks. The corroded cores of plagioclase and the spatial relations suggest the existence of different pulses of magma from basic to acid coming from the same magmatic chamber. En dos bandas del Domo anat&# 233;ctico del Tormes aparece un conjunto de rocas plut&# 243;nicas desde b&# 225;sicas a &# 225;cidas ricas en feldespato pot&# 225;sico, apatito y allanita. Esta mineralog&# 237;a tan particular hace que est&# 233;n enriquecidas en K 20, P 205, LREE y otros elementos de bajo potencial i&# 243;nico. Su quimismo es af&# 237;n a las shoshonitas volc&# 225;nicas, a las vaugneritas del Macizo Central franc&# 233;s y a las series monzon&# 237;ticas de Ballon, siendo, a su vez, casi excepcional en el varisco ib&# 233;rico. Los t&# 233;rminos menos evolucionados est&# 225;n bastante fraccionados por lo que no se trata de fundidos primarios. Durante la diferenciaci&# 243;n existen fases accesorias como apatito, allanita y circ&# 243;n cuya saturaci&# 243;n ejerce un importante efecto en la evoluci&# 243;n del l&# 237;quido residual originando evoluciones quebradas en los diagramas de Harker.
