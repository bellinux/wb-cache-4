50|$|The Northern Sierra Madre forest monitor (Varanus bitatawa), {{also known}} by the local names bitatawa, baritatawa, and butikaw, is a large, arboreal, frugivorous lizard of the genus <b>Varanus.</b> The <b>lizard</b> is a staple food of the Aeta and Ilongot {{indigenous}} people of the Philippines.|$|R
40|$|Four {{new species}} of Abbreviata (Physalopteridae) are {{reported}} from Western Australian snakes, viz. Abbreviata barrowi, sp. nov., Abbreviata occidentalis, sp. nov., Abbreviata kumarinae, sp. nov., and Abbreviata aechmespiculum, sp, nov. Larval Abbreviata not identifiable to species were found in almost half the snakes examined. These were almost absent from the south-west part of Western Australia and were most prevalent {{in the north of}} the state. Infections could not be related to season, or to food residues in the hosts. It is suggested that these larvae were unable to mature in the snakes, which were acting as paratenic hosts, and that the most likely definitive hosts were <b>Varanus</b> <b>lizards.</b> A key to the Abbreviata species from Australian and Papua New Guinea reptiles is provided...|$|R

50|$|The name Perentie {{originates}} from Land Rover's {{successful tender}} to Project Perentie, {{which was the}} official Australian Army trial to select new 1 and 2-tonne light vehicles. During the Project Perentie trials the Land Rover/Isuzu 110 and 6 x 6 variants were compared against the Jeep AM10, the Mercedes-Benz 300GD and the Unimog, while the Toyota Land Cruiser was evaluated two years later. The origins of the name comes from the Perentie (<b>Varanus</b> giganteus) <b>lizard</b> species, {{which is the largest}} goanna lizard native to Australia.|$|R

5000|$|The black {{roughneck}} monitor <b>lizard,</b> <b>Varanus</b> rudicollis, is {{a species}} of monitor lizard found in Southeast Asian countries of Thailand, Burma, and Malaysia.

Can bite human to death.|$|R
5000|$|... 19 {{species of}} {{reptiles}} have been identified, eight {{of which are}} endemic. Common species in the area include large predators like the common reticulated python reticulates, the monitor <b>lizard</b> (<b>Varanus</b> salvator) and the green crested lizard (Bronchocoela cristatella). Amphibian fauna include ten species. The Philippine woodland frog (Rana acanthi) is the most dominant and frequently encountered. One species, Barbourula busuangensis, endemic to Palawan was also observed in the area.|$|R
50|$|Platynota {{was given}} a phylogenetic {{definition}} in 1997. It was erected as a stem-based clade that included Heloderma (the Gila monster and Beaded lizard), Lanthanotus (the Earless monitor <b>lizard),</b> and <b>Varanus</b> (monitor <b>lizards),</b> and all lizards that are {{more closely related to}} them than to other anguimorphs. These other anguimorphs were traditionally called Diploglossa, and include Anguidae, Anniellidae (American legless lizards), and Xenosauridae (knob-scaled lizards). A node-based definition was first given in 1998 in which Platynota included the last common ancestor of Monstersauria (helodermatids) and Varanidae (monitor lizards) and all of its descendants. Under this definition, Platynota includes the same forms as Varanoidea in its traditional sense. Varanoidea, however, has been redefined as a node-based clade including the extinct Telmasaurus and varanids.|$|R
5000|$|Bawean hosts other rare mammals, such as {{crab-eating macaque}} (Macaca fascicularis), Sunda {{porcupine}} (Hystrix javanica), small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). Most common birds are black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), purple heron (Ardea purpurea), great frigatebird (Fregata minor) and gull-billed tern (Gelochelidon nilotica). Reptiles {{are represented by}} different kinds of <b>lizards</b> (<b>Varanus</b> sp [...]), reticulated python (python reticulatus) and saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) which sometimes (rarely) swims to the island.|$|R
50|$|This stork is {{sometimes}} hunted for food, either by native forest dwellers or non-natives {{who have been}} attracted to the area by large-scale land exploitation projects. Although there is a relatively low human population density in areas of undisturbed forest habitat of this species, these people concentrate on gleaning forest products and poaching wildlife. During these activities, Storm's storks are occasionally caught for food either directly by people who extract latex from the jelutong tree, or in baited traps for the monitor <b>lizard</b> <b>Varanus</b> serator.|$|R
5000|$|Eiji Tsuburaya and Akira Watanabe based Varan's {{design on}} {{that of a}} Draco lizard, Godzilla, and a kappa. The name Varan is derived from Varanus pater, or [...] "father of lizards." [...] However, {{it may also be}} named after the genus of monitor <b>lizards</b> <b>Varanus.</b> In its film appearances, Varan does not have any special {{abilities}} such as fiery or radioactive breath. It can however glide at speeds of Mach 1.5, and has a row of spines along its body which may afford protection.|$|R
5000|$|Nile crocodiles, today very {{restricted}} in range, were {{in ancient times}} occasionally found in Southern Europe, having swum across the Mediterranean. Such wayward crocodiles may have inspired dragon myths. Skeletons of whales, as well as dinosaur and mammalian fossils may have been occasionally mistaken for the bones of dragons and other mythological creatures; for example, a discovery in [...] in Wucheng, Xingwen County, Sichuan, China, was labeled as such by Chang Qu. Adrienne Mayor has written {{on the subject of}} fossils as the inspiration for myths in her book The First Fossil Hunters, and in an entry in the Encyclopedia of Geology she wrote: [...] "Fossil remains generated a variety of geomyths speculating on the creatures' identity and cause of their destruction. Many ancient cultures, from China and India to Greece, America, and Australia, told tales of dragons, monsters, and giant heroes..."In Australia, stories of such creatures may have referred to the land crocodiles, Quinkana sp., a terrestrial crocodile which grew to 5 to possibly 7 metres long, or the monitor <b>lizard</b> <b>Varanus</b> priscus (formerly Megalania prisca) a giant carnivorous goanna that might have grown to 7 m, and weighed up to 1,940 kg, or rainbow serpents (possibly Wonambi naracoortensis) that were part of the extinct megafauna of Australia. Today the Komodo monitor <b>lizard</b> <b>Varanus</b> komodoensis is known in English as the Komodo dragon.|$|R
30|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the Forensic Science Simulation site at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia (West of Malaysia Peninsular: 2.9 ° N, 101.8 ° E, at an altitude of 42 [*]m above sea level). This site is a protected area and has been used for many decomposition studies in the previous years. The carcass placement site is a shaded secondary forest which received moderate sunlight. Common scavengers in the study area are domestic dogs, cobras (Naja naja), and monitor <b>lizards</b> (<b>Varanus</b> salvator). The duration of the study was two [*]years, from 13 November 2009 until 8 June 2011.|$|R
50|$|Ecologically, Bangka and its waters {{contain an}} {{abundance}} of biodiversity. Land animals include Javanese deer (Rusa timorensis), tarsier (Carlito syrichta - a nocturnal arboreal primate), common cuscus (Phalanger orientalis), Asian water monitor <b>lizard</b> (<b>Varanus</b> salvator) and wild boar (Sus scrofa). There are many coral reefs that attract tropical fish species, such as Napoleon fish, frogfish, pygmy seahorses and nudibranchs, as well as dugongs: a species of protected marine mammal. Dugongs are known to dwell and feed in waters off the island's coast. Also present is a species of tubular marine sponge, the Petrosia nigricans, from which four new purine derivatives have been isolated.|$|R
