5|$|The {{skull of}} the Acrocanthosaurus atokensis holotype shows light exostotic {{material}} on the squamosal. The neural spine of the eleventh <b>vertebra</b> was fractured and healed while the neural spine of its third tail <b>vertebra</b> had an unusual hook-like structure.|$|E
5|$|Apatodon mirus, {{based on}} a scrap of <b>vertebra</b> Marsh first {{thought to be a}} {{mammalian}} jaw, has been listed as a synonym of Allosaurus fragilis. However, it was considered indeterminate beyond Dinosauria by Dan Chure, and Mickey Mortimer believes that the synonymy of Apatodon with Allosaurus was due to correspondence to Ralph Molnar by John McIntosh, whereby the latter reportedly found a paper saying that Othniel Charles Marsh admitted that the Apatodon holotype was actually an allosaurid dorsal <b>vertebra.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pseudoryzomys has 19 or 20thoracic (chest) and lumbar vertebrae, 13 {{of which}} bear ribs, as is {{characteristic}} of oryzomyines. The first ribs contact both the seventh cervical (neck) <b>vertebra</b> and the first thoracic <b>vertebra,</b> an important character of the Sigmodontinae. Unlike in most sigmodontines, including Holochilus and Lundomys, the fourth lumbar <b>vertebra</b> lacks the processes known as anapophyses. There are three or four sacral and about 29caudal (tail) vertebrae. Between {{the second and third}} caudal vertebrae, separate bones called hemal arches are present. These display a spinous process at the back, as in both Holochilus and Lundomys. On the humerus, the upper arm bone, the entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; in some other cricetids, it perforates the far (distal) end of the humerus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vertebrae</b> {{take their}} names from {{the regions of}} the {{vertebral}} column that they occupy. There are thirty-three <b>vertebrae</b> in the human vertebral column—seven cervical <b>vertebrae,</b> twelve thoracic <b>vertebrae,</b> five lumbar <b>vertebrae,</b> five fused sacral <b>vertebrae</b> forming the sacrum and three to five coccygeal <b>vertebrae,</b> forming the coccyx. The regional <b>vertebrae</b> increase in size as they progress downwards but become smaller in the coccyx.|$|R
5|$|The {{vertebral}} column of Scelidosaurus contained {{at least six}} neck <b>vertebrae,</b> seventeen dorsal <b>vertebrae,</b> four sacral <b>vertebrae</b> and at least thirty-five tail <b>vertebrae.</b>|$|R
25|$|The axial column {{consisted}} of eleven neck <b>vertebrae,</b> seventeen dorsal <b>vertebrae,</b> six sacral <b>vertebrae</b> and forty tail <b>vertebrae.</b> The tail was relatively short.|$|R
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} a metal box brought in {{containing}} the remains of Billy Miles. The coroner examines it and notices {{what appears to be}} a metal <b>vertebra.</b> After he leaves the room, the metal <b>vertebra</b> begins to spin, growing into what looks like the beginnings of a metallic spine. Meanwhile, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Monica Reyes arrive at the abandoned town where Special Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) was born.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is one of}} {{the upper}} parts of the digestive system. There are taste buds on its upper part. It begins {{at the back of the}} mouth, passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum, through the diaphragm, and into the stomach. In humans, the esophagus generally starts around the level of the sixth cervical <b>vertebra</b> behind the cricoid cartilage of the trachea, enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth thoracic <b>vertebra,</b> and ends at the cardia of the stomach, at the level of the eleventh thoracic <b>vertebra.</b> The esophagus is usually about 25cm (10in) in length.|$|E
5|$|Adam Yates (2004) {{described}} a single sauropod tail <b>vertebra</b> from the Upper Elliot Formation of South Africa that may {{belong to a}} genus closely related to Vulcanodon. The Upper Elliot Formation {{is famous for its}} abundant fossils of the prosauropod Massospondylus.|$|E
50|$|The {{vertebral}} column of Scelidosaurus contained {{at least six}} neck <b>vertebrae,</b> seventeen dorsal <b>vertebrae,</b> four sacral <b>vertebrae</b> and at least thirty-five tail <b>vertebrae.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{articulating}} <b>vertebrae</b> {{are named}} {{according to their}} region of the spine. There are seven cervical <b>vertebrae,</b> twelve thoracic <b>vertebrae</b> and five lumbar <b>vertebrae.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thoracic <b>vertebrae</b> in all {{mammalian}} {{species are}} those <b>vertebrae</b> that also carry {{a pair of}} ribs, and lie caudal to the cervical <b>vertebrae.</b> Further caudally follow the lumbar <b>vertebrae,</b> which also belong to the trunk, but do not carry ribs. In reptiles, all trunk <b>vertebrae</b> carry ribs and are called dorsal <b>vertebrae.</b>|$|R
5|$|A Megalosaurus rib {{figured in}} 1856 and 1884 by Sir Richard Owen has a {{pathological}} swollen spot {{near the base}} of its capitular process. The swollen spot {{appears to have been}} caused by a healed fracture and is located at the point where it would have articulated with its <b>vertebra.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kühn {{was born}} in Dresden, Germany on 14 February 1982. At the age of 20, after {{finishing}} high school, she took a holiday in the United States. While horseback riding in Monument Valley, she had a bad fall and became paralysed from the fifth thoracic <b>vertebra</b> down.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe's neck {{vertebrae}} have {{ball and}} socket joints. In particular, the atlas–axis joint (C1 and C2) allows the animal to tilt its head vertically and reach more branches with the tongue. The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie {{between the first and}} second thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike most other ruminants where the articulation is between the seventh cervical <b>vertebra</b> (C7) and T1. This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra cervical <b>vertebra.</b> However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating rib, deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and maladies.|$|E
25|$|There {{are seven}} {{cervical}} <b>vertebrae,</b> twelve thoracic <b>vertebrae</b> and five lumbar <b>vertebrae.</b> The number of <b>vertebrae</b> {{in a region}} can vary but overall the number remains the same. The number {{of those in the}} cervical region however is only rarely changed. The <b>vertebrae</b> of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spines are independent bones, and generally quite similar. The <b>vertebrae</b> of the sacrum and coccyx are usually fused and unable to move independently. Two special <b>vertebrae</b> are the atlas and axis, on which the head rests.|$|R
50|$|The <b>vertebrae</b> in {{the human}} {{vertebral}} column are divided into different regions, which correspond to the curves of the spinal column. The articulating <b>vertebrae</b> are named according to their region of the spine. <b>Vertebrae</b> in these regions are essentially alike, with minor variation. These regions are called the cervical spine, thoracic spine, lumbar spine, sacrum and coccyx.There are seven cervical <b>vertebrae,</b> twelve thoracic <b>vertebrae</b> and five lumbar <b>vertebrae.</b> The number of <b>vertebrae</b> in a region can vary but overall the number remains the same. The number {{of those in the}} cervical region however is only rarely changed. The <b>vertebrae</b> of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spines are independent bones, and generally quite similar.

5|$|Although {{the exact}} numbers are unknown, the {{vertebral}} column of Megalosaurus was probably divided into ten neck <b>vertebrae,</b> thirteen dorsal <b>vertebrae,</b> five sacral <b>vertebrae</b> and fifty to sixty tail <b>vertebrae,</b> as {{is common for}} basal Tetanurae.|$|R
5|$|The neck <b>vertebra</b> {{referred}} to Hatzegopteryx sp. contains {{a number of}} traits that allow {{for it to be}} definitely identified as that of an azhdarchid. The centrum is relatively low, the zygapophyses are large and flattened, and the preserved portions of the neural spine indicate that it is bifid, or split into two.|$|E
5|$|The tail, {{according}} to Schwartz, {{is longer than}} in the potto. He does not provide measurements of the tail of AMZ 6698 and notes {{that at least one}} <b>vertebra</b> is missing, but Sarmiento counted 11 caudal vertebrae in an illustration of AMZ 6698 and Groves counted at least 15. However, Sarmiento found that the number of caudal vertebrae ranges from 5 to 17, with an average of 11, in pottos. Relatively long tails are also common in the western form of the potto, though {{according to}} Stump the tail of Pseudopotto is longer than any seen in pottos. The false potto allegedly has shorter spines on its cervical (neck) and first and second thoracic (chest) vertebrae, but Leon notes that this feature is also seen in western pottos. Schwartz writes that the false potto differs from pottos and angwantibos in lacking a bifid (two-tipped) spine on the second cervical <b>vertebra,</b> but Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 potto specimens he examined.|$|E
5|$|Though wounded, Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury kept shooting. One of them, perhaps Billy, shot Morgan Earp {{across the}} back in a wound that struck both {{shoulder}} blades and a <b>vertebra.</b> Morgan went down for a minute before picking himself up. Either Frank or Billy shot Virgil Earp in the calf (Virgil thought it was Billy). Virgil, though hit, fired his next shot at Billy Clanton.|$|E
50|$|Cats {{have seven}} {{cervical}} <b>vertebrae</b> like almost all mammals, thirteen thoracic <b>vertebrae</b> (humans have twelve), seven lumbar <b>vertebrae</b> (humans have five), three sacral <b>vertebrae</b> (humans have five {{because of their}} bipedal posture), and, except for Manx cats and other shorter tailed cats, twenty-two or twenty-three caudal <b>vertebrae</b> (humans have three to five, fused into an internal coccyx). The extra lumbar and thoracic <b>vertebrae</b> account for the cat's enhanced spinal mobility and flexibility, compared to humans. The caudal <b>vertebrae</b> form the tail, used by the cat as a counterbalance to the body during quick movements. Between their <b>vertebrae,</b> they have elastic discs, useful for cushioning the jump landings.|$|R
25|$|Ornitholestes had a {{relatively}} short neck with a slight sigmoidal (S-shaped) curve. The tail was long and whiplike, comprising {{over half of the}} body's length. Not all of the <b>vertebrae</b> were preserved, but Osborn (1917) estimated that Ornitholestes had nine or ten cervical (neck) <b>vertebrae,</b> thirteen dorsal (back) <b>vertebrae,</b> four sacral (hip) <b>vertebrae,</b> and 39 to 44 caudal (tail) <b>vertebrae.</b> Carpenter et al. (2005a) recorded that the specimen contained five sacral <b>vertebrae.</b> Ornitholestes was a short-bodied theropod, and this was reflected in the short front-to-back dimensions of the cervical and dorsal <b>vertebrae.</b>|$|R
50|$|Iberolacerta {{contains}} presacral <b>vertebrae</b> {{that differ}} upon sex. Males presacral <b>vertebrae</b> {{can range from}} 25-26, white the larger females presacral <b>vertebrae</b> can range from 26-29. Both sex also contain an average of 6 posterior presacral <b>vertebrae</b> with relatively short ribs. The tail <b>vertebrae</b> can contain the common A-type pattern or less common B-type pattern.|$|R
5|$|As {{in other}} dromaeosaurs, Velociraptor tails had long bony {{projections}} (prezygapophyses) {{on the upper}} surfaces of the vertebrae, as well as ossified tendons underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (caudal) <b>vertebra</b> and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail {{to act as a}} single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S-shape, suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought.|$|E
5|$|As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, there are twelve ribs. The first rib articulates {{with both the}} last {{cervical}} (neck) and first thoracic (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. Anapophyses, processes {{at the back of}} a <b>vertebra,</b> are absent from the fifth lumbar. Between the second and third caudal vertebrae, hemal arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen perforates the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone).|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{from other}} parts of the UK and Iberia, mostly {{isolated}} teeth, have subsequently been attributed to Baryonyx or similar animals. Isolated teeth and bones from the Isle of Wight, including hand bones and a <b>vertebra,</b> have been attributed to this genus. A maxilla fragment from La Rioja, Spain, was attributed in 1995. In 1999 a postorbital bone, a squamosal bone, a tooth, <b>vertebra</b> remains, metacarpals, and a phalanx from the Sala de los Infantes deposit in Burgos Province, Spain, were attributed to an immature Baryonyx (though some of these elements are unknown in the holotype), and dinosaur tracks near Burgos have been identified as those of Baryonyx or a similar theropod. In 2011 a specimen (ML1190) from the Papo Seco Formation in Boca do Chapim, Portugal, with a fragmentary dentary, teeth, vertebrae, ribs, hip bones, a scapula, and a phalanx bone, was attributed to Baryonyx, the most complete Iberian remains of the animal. The skeletal elements of this specimen are also represented in the more complete holotype NHM R9951, except for the mid-neck vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of A. atacis {{is a group}} of three connected dorsal <b>vertebrae.</b> Cervical <b>vertebrae</b> are uncommon from Bellevue {{and most of them are}} poorly preserved. The <b>vertebrae</b> are opisthocoelous, with centra that lengthen toward the rear. Neural spines have been preserved on the <b>vertebrae,</b> and they face toward the rear. Two dorsal <b>vertebrae</b> were preserved with a complete, but very crushed neural arch, a neural spine with a characteristic shape: it is very widened distally and narrows downwards. The <b>vertebrae</b> also have an internal structure that is spongy, with very large cells. The caudal <b>vertebrae</b> are all strongly procoelous and are compressed on the sides. The neural spines of the caudal <b>vertebrae</b> are very narrow and very tall and point toward the rear. The middle caudal <b>vertebrae</b> are more compressed on the sides that the others. Also, the centrum of middle caudal <b>vertebrae</b> is longer proportionally. Two sacral <b>vertebrae</b> were known from Bellevue. They are poorly preserved, and are thought to belong to a juvenile. A complete sacrum was also found in 2002.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} the bones of Lohuecotitan were {{internally}} pneumatized, including the cervical <b>vertebrae,</b> sacral <b>vertebrae,</b> and ilium. As is common in somphospondylans, the pneumatic fossae on the cervical <b>vertebrae</b> are shallow; {{this was also the}} case in the dorsal <b>vertebrae.</b> The cervical and dorsal <b>vertebrae</b> are opisthocoelous; the caudal <b>vertebrae</b> were procoelous (a characteristic common in Lithostrotia). The seventh and eighth tail <b>vertebrae</b> are fused together; this probably represents a pathology. As in other titanosauriforms, the dorsal ribs are compressed and blade-like. The ulna was robust, and the bottom surface of the tibia was oval-shaped, as is common in titanosaurs.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the spinal}} column of Simosuchus is known. There are eight {{cervical}} <b>vertebrae</b> in the neck, at least fifteen dorsal <b>vertebrae</b> in the back, two sacral <b>vertebrae</b> at the hip, {{and no more}} than twenty caudal <b>vertebrae</b> in the tail. The number of <b>vertebrae</b> in the tail is less than that of most crocodyliforms, giving Simosuchus a very short tail.|$|R
5|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a unique {{combination}} of traits not in themselves unique. The transverse processes, the side extensions, of the tail are present up to the twenty-eighth <b>vertebra</b> of the series. The transverse processes of the front tail vertebrae are rod-shaped with narrow bases and do not touch the plate formed by the fusion of the processes of the sacral vertebrae. The chevrons, bones pointing to below from the bottom side of the tail vertebrae, have {{the shape of an}} inverted T. The length of the ilium equals, or is greater than, that of the thighbone.|$|E
5|$|Holger Glinicki {{was born}} in Hamburg on 25 October 1952. He was paralysed {{following}} a motorcycle accident in 1972 that broke his fourth thoracic <b>vertebra.</b> He became involved in disability sports, playing wheelchair basketball for RSC Hamburg, who were the German national champions in 1983, and played a total of 123 international games. He became assistant coach of the German women's national wheelchair basketball team in 2003, and then coach in 2006. The team won five consecutive European championships, in 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011, and a silver medal at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} educate people about extinct forms of life, the Geological Survey of India {{installed}} lifesize fibreglass models of Rajasaurus and Titanosaurus at their Lucknow regional office. The installation is presented in an appropriate setting, with representations of plants that existed during the Mesozoic Era. Also displayed are limb bones, <b>vertebra,</b> eggs and coprolites of sauropod dinosaurs and fossil eggs of Rajasaurus collected from Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} tail, {{the number of}} <b>vertebrae</b> in mammals is {{generally}} fairly constant. There are almost always seven cervical <b>vertebrae</b> (sloths and manatees are among the few exceptions), followed by around twenty or so further <b>vertebrae,</b> divided between the thoracic and lumbar forms, depending {{on the number of}} ribs. There are generally three to five <b>vertebrae</b> with the sacrum, and anything up to fifty caudal <b>vertebrae.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>vertebrae</b> in {{the middle}} and {{toward the end of the}} tail were short, {{distinguishing}} it from titanosaurs like Andesaurus, Malawisaurus, Aeolosaurus, Alamosaurus, and Saltasaurus. The neural spines {{in the middle}} tail <b>vertebrae</b> are angled toward the front of the animal. These <b>vertebrae</b> resemble those of Cedarosaurus, Aeolosaurus, and Gondwanatitan. The <b>vertebrae</b> are located at a transitional position from anterior to posterior caudal <b>vertebrae.</b>|$|R
50|$|The hyposphene-hypantrum {{articulation}} is {{an accessory}} joint {{found in the}} <b>vertebrae</b> of several fossil reptiles of the group Archosauromorpha. It consists of a process on the backside of the <b>vertebrae,</b> the hyposphene, that fits in a depression in the front side of the next <b>vertebrae,</b> the hypantrum. Hyposphene-hypantrum articulations occur in the dorsal <b>vertebrae</b> and sometimes also in the posteriormost cervical and anteriormost caudal <b>vertebrae.</b>|$|R
