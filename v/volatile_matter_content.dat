Volatile matter is known to {{decrease}} {{with an increase in}} rank, and {{it is one of the}} most important parameters that determine the suitable application of a coal. In metallurgical coke making, volatile matter does not form part of the coke; it usually evolves as tar during carbonization. High-volatile bituminous coal, due to its high <b>volatile</b> <b>matter</b> <b>content,</b> generates high pressure during carbonization which can damage the coke oven walls[13]. Medium-volatile coals (volatile contents in the range of 27.70 % to 30.30 %) are known to produce good coke[15].

Initially the stockpile coal (1 st November 2015) had 23.9 % VM, that increased within a month to 25.3 %. Initial increase in volatile content results due to adsorption of oxygen from the atmosphere. Subsequent erratic, but gradual decrease till 1 st June 2016 to the level of 22 % is possibly due to oxidation at low temperature with release of combustion products (Banerjee et al. 2000; Leonard 1977; Kus and Kennan 2017; Jose et al. 1996) and natural decomposition of various hydrocarbons as described in Sect.  3.1. During June and subsequent monsoon months, volatile matter consistently increases possibly because of natural decomposition of fixed carbon and producing thereof volatile matter by oxidation process, weather (alternatively intense heat and intense rain) being conducive to that (Leonard 1977; Kus and Kennan 2017; Fredricks et al. 1983).
