5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The <b>Vampire</b> <b>Slayer</b> franchise.

5|$|The role of John Hart in Torchwood {{was written}} with the casting of Marsters in mind after he {{contacted}} the shows' producers expressing {{his interest in}} appearing in the programme's parent show, Doctor Who. The character is used to illuminate some of Jack's own characteristics as a doppelgänger who provides both an exaggerated version of, and a parallel to, aspects of Jack's persona.

5|$|Christy is {{the oldest}} of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal, and her powers were {{inherited}} from her maternal grandmother, making her a carrier of the genes determining magical ability. As a witch, Christy possesses the basic ability to cast spells, perform rituals, brew potions, scry for lost people or objects {{through the use of}} a crystal pendant, and communicate with the dead.

Carl and Helen Jenkins (David Starzyk and Barbara Niven) said Christy heard voices prior to her kidnapping, implying that this power was already active. As a firestarter, Christy had the power of pyrokinesis; this power could be augmented by Billie's projection powers to vanquish demons previously believed to be invincible. Christy was identified as the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her relationship with Billie. Demain of Television Without Pity compared Christy to Buffy the <b>Vampire</b> <b>Slayer</b> character Dawn Summers as they were both referenced as the Key.|$|E
5|$|Veteran Disney Channel writers Schooley and McCorkle were {{recruited}} by the network to develop an animated series that could attract both younger and older audiences, and conceived Kim Possible as a show about a talented action heroine and her less competent sidekick. Inspired by the scarcity of female-led animated series at the time, the episodes, {{some of which are}} based on the creators' own high school experiences, combine elements of action, adventure, drama, romance and comedy to appeal to both girls and boys, while parodying the James Bond franchise, spy and superhero films, and teen sitcoms. Distinct from other Disney Channel shows in its use of self-referential humor, Schooley and McCorkle developed fast-paced sitcom-style dialogue to cater to adult viewers. Set in fictional Middleton, USA, the show's setting and locations exhibit a retro-influenced aesthetic. With a strong emphasis on modern-day technology and the Internet, the series also explores themes such as feminism, girl power and relationships, and receives heavy comparisons to other female-driven action shows such as Buffy the <b>Vampire</b> <b>Slayer,</b> Alias and The Powerpuff Girls.|$|E
