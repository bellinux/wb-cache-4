5|$|As {{with many}} {{cities and towns}} in the United Kingdom, the age {{of a number of}} the {{buildings}} in Chew Stoke, including the church, school, and several houses, reflects the long history of the <b>village.</b> <b>For</b> example, Chew Stoke School has approximately 170 pupils between 4 and 11 years old. After the age of 11, most pupils attend Chew Valley School. These two buildings were built in 1858 on the site of a former charity school founded in 1718. The architect was S.B. Gabriel of Bristol. Additional classrooms were built in 1926, and further alterations and extensions were carried out in 1970.|$|E

They operate two facilities off Gnangara Road in Cullacabardee, {{both of which were}} established in 1991 - the Rick Hammersley Centre, a therapeutic community where residents spend 10 weeks, followed by a two-week community re-entry skills development program, and the Saranna Women's Program, a residential <b>village</b> <b>for</b> women affected by addictive or compulsive behaviour and their children, where residents spend a minimum of three months and also receive assistance for re-entry into the general community.|$|E
5|$|Following {{an initial}} {{decline in the}} {{population}} of Navenby {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, the post-war years saw numbers rise steeply. This increase can be directly linked to the 35-plus new houses built from the end of The Great War until the 1950s, as well as to other building projects from the 1970s onwards. Other post-war changes include the move away from a dependence on farming. Although Navenby continues to be surrounded by farms, it is now largely a dormitory <b>village</b> <b>for</b> Lincoln, Grantham and beyond. Figures from the 2001 census show that, out of a population of 1,666, almost 600 commute to work each day.|$|E
5|$|Gyeongju {{emerged as}} a {{railroad}} junction in the later years of the Japanese Occupation, as the Donghae Nambu Line and Jungang Line were established {{in preparation for the}} Second Sino-Japanese War and to exploit the rich resources of {{the eastern part of the}} Korean peninsula. Following liberation in 1945, Korea was plunged into turmoil, and Gyeongju was no exception. Returnees from abroad were numerous; a <b>village</b> <b>for</b> them was constructed in present-day Dongcheon-dong. In a period marked by widespread conflict and unrest, the Gyeongju area became particularly notorious for the level of guerrilla activity in the mountains.|$|E

Construction commenced in 1948, and the first residents moved in two years later. It housed the entire Black community of Oak Ridge until the early 1960s.|$|E

The valet service has no extra charge.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid 19th century Radyr was a {{collection}} of small farms, crofts and cottages, but after Radyr railway station opened in 1863, the population rose from 400 to more than 600 in 20 years. The Taff Vale Railway and its successor, the Great Western Railway, brought significant employment to Radyr. Junction Terrace (the first street in Radyr) was built to house the railway workers. It {{was the start of}} strong demand for housing in Radyr that transformed the hamlet. The Barry Railway's Walnut Tree Viaduct, built in 1901, dominated the <b>village</b> <b>for</b> some 70 years.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{had left}} Canton, Simão de Andrade landed at Xiamen and Ningbo, {{establishing}} settlements there. Simão continued to defy local Chinese laws at Ningbo, and when his men were cheated on a trade deal with a Chinese man in 1545, Simão sent a band of armed men into the town, pillaged it, and took local women and young girls as their captives. The outraged locals banded together and slaughtered the Portuguese under Simão. A similar episode occurred later when Coelho de Sousa seized {{the house of a}} wealthy foreign resident in Jinzhou of Fujian, which led authorities to cut off supplies to the Portuguese; the Portuguese then attacked and ransacked a nearby <b>village</b> <b>for</b> supplies, which prompted Chinese authorities to destroy thirteen of their ships while thirty Portuguese survivors of this settlement fled to the Portuguese settlement at Macau in 1549.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff Manor {{maintains}} a voting custom that dates {{to at least}} around 1905. In addition to its customary general election, held at the same day in every municipality in New York, the village has a nonpartisan caucus, a town meeting-style forum to determine officeholders. The system of the People's Caucus is largely unique to the village, and {{has been described as}} an extension of the New England town hall concept. The People's Caucus, officially formed in 1946, chooses candidates by majority vote two months before the village election, where the candidates usually run unopposed, turning the election into a formality. The caucus is open to citizens of 18 years or over who have lived in the <b>village</b> <b>for</b> at least a month; voter registration is not required. Voters and candidates do not declare party affiliations, instead candidates present their platforms in early January of each year, and weeks later the caucus meets again to vote.|$|E

Later, Harsha and Charuseela learn that Ratnam is going to take over all the agricultural land around the <b>village</b> <b>for</b> political gain since the value of the land will appreciate following the official declaration of a new coastal industrial corridor.

5|$|In {{its early}} years, the library {{received}} book donations {{from the village}} Sunday school and the Club. In July 1928, the library moved from the Community Center building to the tower room of the former Briarcliff Farms office building, currently {{a branch of the}} International Union of Operating Engineers. The Community Center building was sold in October 1929 for $16,000; these funds were required to be used for recreational purposes. Thus, the organization gave $11,000 to the <b>village</b> <b>for</b> the construction of the Law Memorial Park pool, and $5,000 to the library. Upon the building's sale and the Club's dissolution, the library was reconstituted as an association library with a 15-member board of trustees.|$|E
5|$|Lead mining on Grassington Moor became {{important}} in the 18th century, {{and as a result}} of the mines' success, a number of the mine owners promoted the provision of the Grassington to Pately Bridge turnpike road, which was begun in 1760 and provided an all-weather route across the moors for wagons. From the early 19th century Hebden was a dormitory <b>village</b> <b>for</b> some miners, contributing to the population rising to more than 500 in the 1830s. In the early 1850s profitable mines were established in the parish to the north of the village on veins associated with Grassington Moor, which helped sustain the population. Although activity continued sporadically into the last decade of the century, the accessible ore was largely exhausted by 1865, and the population declined to a low of 199 in 1901.|$|E
