5|$|As a youth, Berkman was {{influenced}} by the growing radicalism that was spreading among workers in the Russian capital. A wave of political assassinations culminated in a bomb blast that killed Tsar Alexander II in 1881.

He became <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> when his favorite uncle, his mother's brother Mark Natanson, was sentenced to death for revolutionary activities.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} volumes of The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley were {{published}} in 1858, but were poorly received by critics. The book was not as well edited as his previous article and many felt {{that it did not}} contain the insights about Shelley and his works that Shelley at Oxford did. The reception was not universally negative however, and several of Shelley's friends enjoyed the book. The Shelley family was <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> at the way Shelley was portrayed; they demanded the return of Shelley's papers and obtained an injunction preventing the publication of any further volumes. Hogg had begun writing a third, but it was never completed.|$|E
5|$|D was {{a success}} in Japan. In total it sold one million copies there and the Saturn version {{reached the top of}} the sales charts in its first week. It was one of the few genuine hits for the 3DO in Japan, and drew a {{significant}} cult following of hardcore fans even before being ported to other systems. A Japanese re-release for the 3DO titled D's Diner: Director's Cut contained additional content and a bonus soundtrack disc. The PlayStation release of D was set to be published by Acclaim and manufactured by Sony. Orders for around 100,000 units had already been made before Sony decided to give their other titles manufacturing priority. Sony told Eno they had only manufactured 40,000 units, which made Eno <b>very</b> <b>upset,</b> but ultimately, Sony had only manufactured 28,000 units. This shortage upset Eno so much that he later announced, at a Sony event, that he would release his next games for the Sega Saturn. WARP's later games, including those in the D series, Enemy Zero (1996) and D2 (1999), were released exclusively on Sega platforms.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am sorry, Béla! I seem to {{have been}} all queer the whole of to-day. It is a <b>very</b> <b>upsetting</b> time for any girl, you must remember.

5|$|Few {{people in}} London {{other than their}} close friends knew that the couple were not married. Hogg's family had heard rumours that he was {{planning}} to marry, and had been curious to know whom he had chosen. They were <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> after hearing of his plans for a union with Jane. His mother was unwilling to introduce Jane to their social circles as Mrs Hogg, which ensured that she would never visit them. Hogg did not enter his family's house in Durham for seven years after he informed them of his relationship with Jane. Word of their union spread throughout Durham, and Hogg stopped practising law there for some time because of the damage to his reputation. Several of their friends were supportive of their union. Mary Shelley particularly approved of their match, despite having earlier been jealous of the time Hogg had spent with Jane.|$|E
