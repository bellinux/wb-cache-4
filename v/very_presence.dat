5|$|Under the new system, {{newly elected}} magistrates were awarded with {{automatic}} {{membership in the}} senate, although it remained difficult for a Plebeian from an unknown family to enter the senate. Several factors {{made it difficult for}} individuals from unknown families to be elected to high office, in particular the <b>very</b> <b>presence</b> of a long-standing nobility, as this appealed to the deeply rooted Roman respect for the past. Ultimately, a new Patricio-Plebeian aristocracy emerged, which replaced the old Patrician nobility. It was the dominance of the long-standing Patrician nobility which ultimately forced the Plebeians to wage their long struggle for political power. The new nobility, however, was fundamentally different from the old nobility. The old nobility existed through the force of law, because only Patricians were allowed to stand for high office, and it was ultimately overthrown after those laws were changed. Now, however, the new nobility existed due to the organization of society, and as such, it could only be overthrown through a revolution.|$|E

In this edition, the main character checks into a small-town hotel, his <b>very</b> <b>presence</b> seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife.

25|$|The {{effect of}} the {{partisan}} psychological warfare is hard to evaluate. Nevertheless, it appears that at least {{a part of the}} defections from the Wehrmacht and other Axis troops, that occurred on the Eastern front in 1942-1944, might be attributed to the partisan propaganda effort, as well as the relatively high number of the local volunteers to the Soviet guerrilla detachments starting from the summer of 1943. Furthermore, in many occupied areas the <b>very</b> <b>presence</b> of anti-German irregulars emphasized the continued presence of ‘Kremlin’s watchful eye’, unnerved occupying forces and their collaborators and thus undermined the enemy’s attempt to ‘pacify’ the local populace.|$|E
25|$|For Governor Trott, {{this proved}} a tempting offer. The Nine Years' War had been raging for eight years, and the island, which the Royal Navy had not visited in several years, was perilously underpopulated. Trott {{knew that the}} French had {{recently}} captured Exuma, 140 miles to the southeast, and were now headed for New Providence. With only sixty or seventy men living in the town, half of whom served guard duty at any one time, there was no practical way to keep Fort Nassau's twenty-eight cannons fully manned. However, if the Fancy's crew stayed in Nassau it would {{more than double the}} island's male population, while the <b>very</b> <b>presence</b> of the Fancy in the harbor might deter a French attack. On the other hand, turning away Captain Bridgeman might spell disaster if his intentions turned violent, as his crew of 113 (plus ninety slaves) would easily defeat the island's inhabitants. Lastly, there was also the bribe to consider, which was three times Trott's annual salary of £300.|$|E
25|$|As Frank Herbert's Dune (1965) begins, Duke Leto Atreides {{finds himself}} in a {{dangerous}} position; the 81st Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV has put him {{in control of the}} desert planet Arrakis, known as Dune, which is the only natural source of the all-important spice melange. The most valuable commodity in the known universe, the spice not only makes safe and reliable interstellar travel possible, but also prolongs life, protects against disease, and is used by the Bene Gesserit to enhance their abilities. The potential financial gains for House Atreides are mitigated by the fact that mining melange from the desert surface of Arrakis is an expensive and hazardous undertaking, thanks to the treacherous environment and constant threat of giant sandworms which protect the spice. In addition, Leto is aware that Shaddam, feeling threatened by the rising power and influence of the Atreides, has sent him into a trap; failure to meet or exceed the production volume of their predecessors, the vicious House Harkonnen, will negatively affect the position of House Atreides in CHOAM, which relies on spice profits. Further, the <b>very</b> <b>presence</b> of the Atreides on Arrakis inflames the long-simmering War of Assassins between House Atreides and House Harkonnen, a feud ignited 10,000 years before when an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after the Butlerian Jihad.|$|E

Zelena then sees Emma {{trying to break the}} protection spell that Zelena put on the town hall knowing that Emma wants to kill Hades (after she saw the new pages appear in front of her), leading to a confrontation between the women. Back inside the town hall after they entered through a tunnel, Regina and Robin uses Zelena's distraction to take the baby, only to be caught by Hades, who wants to use the crystal to destroy Regina first explaining that the crystal won't allow the person {{to move on to the}} Underworld but rather simply destroying their <b>very</b> <b>presence,</b> but Robin sacrifices himself as he saves Regina from being destroyed by Hades. Then Zelena comes in, and picks up the crystal as Hades tempted Zelena to kill Regina, only to have Zelena realize that Hades never changed and kills Hades instantly by stabbing the crystal through his heart. Later, Emma, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, Regina, Zelena and others attend Robin Hood's funeral, as Zelena tells Regina that she has named her daughter Robin in honor of her father. Emma decides to stay for a couple more minutes, and notices a resurrected Hook, who was brought back by Zeus as a reward for helping to defeat Hades, and the two are happily reunited. During this time, Mr. Gold comes inside Regina's office, and it is revealed that a piece of the Olympian Crystal is still around, which Mr. Gold collects for a new plan.|$|E

500|$|The Huffington Posts Matthew Jacobs {{placed it}} at number 26 of his list [...] "The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles".

Similarly, Spins Annie Zaleski wrote that the [...] "nuanced but proud" [...] rendition of the song [...] "marked the start of Madonna’s Serious Phase, one where she balanced youthful coquettishness with a more mature, introspective outlook". AllMusic's Jose F.

In his review of Madonna's second greatest hits album, GHV2 (2001), Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave a more critical reception, as he felt the track was out of place among other Madonna songs; [...] "the <b>very</b> <b>presence</b> of 'Don't Cry for Me Argentina' [...] simply does not feel comfortable next {{to the rest of the}} savvy, modern music". A negative review came from NMEs Alex Needham, who wrote; [...] "by 1996 Madonna was fast turning into the pop equivalent of Sunset Boulevards Norma Desmond, croaking, 'I'm still big!

In the winter of 1899–1900 he began attending the Sreda (Wednesday) literary group in Moscow, striking up a friendship with the Nikolay Teleshov, among others.

[...] The ship was built from clustered space shuttle external fuel tanks which, instead of reentering Earth's atmosphere, had been boosted into orbit until enough had been amassed to build the ship. [...] The mission is a joint American–Russian undertaking, and seventy of the First Hundred are drawn from these countries (except, for example, Michel Duval, a French psychologist assigned to observe their behavior). The book details the trip out, construction of the first settlement on Mars (eventually called Underhill) by Russian engineer Nadia Cherneshevsky, as well as establishing colonies on Mars' hollowed out asteroid-moon Phobos, the ever-changing relationships between the colonists, debates among the colonists regarding both the terraforming of the planet and its future relationship to Earth.

[...] David Balls of Digital Spy agreed saying that [...] "Timbaland dips into his usual bag of production tricks here and many of the supporting cast dutifully return, but never does this quite reach the same excitement levels as its predecessor. [...] it feels as though Tim's trying so hard to impress us with his pimped-up SUV that he's driven the thing off the road. The result? A disparate, disjointed collection of songs that feels like less {{than the sum of its}} parts.
