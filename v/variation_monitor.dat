40|$|In {{studies that}} {{estimate}} the short-term effects {{of air pollution}} on health, daily measurements of pollution concentrations are often available {{from a number of}} monitoring locations within the study area. However, the health data are typically only available in the form of daily counts for the entire area, meaning that a corresponding single daily measure of pollution is required. The standard approach is to average the observed measurements at the monitoring locations, and use this in a log-linear health model. However, as the pollution surface is spatially variable this simple summary is unlikely to be an accurate estimate of the average pollution concentration across the region, which may lead to bias in the resulting health effects. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that jointly models the pollution concentrations and their relationship with the health data using a Bayesian spatio-temporal model. We compare this approach with the simple spatial average using a simulation study, by investigating the impact of spatial <b>variation,</b> <b>monitor</b> placement, and measurement error in the pollution data. An epidemiological study from Greater London is then presented, which estimates the relationship between respiratory mortality and four different pollutants...|$|E
40|$|For {{nanotechnology}} nodes, {{the feature}} size is shrunk rapidly, the wire becomes narrow and thin, {{it leads to}} high RC parasitic, especially for resistance. The overall system performance are dominated by interconnect rather than device. As such, {{it is imperative to}} accurately measure and model interconnect parasitic in order to predict interconnect performance on silicon. Despite many test structures developed in the past to characterize device models and layout effects, only few of them are available for interconnects. Nevertheless, they are either not suitable for real chip implementation or too complicated to be embedded. A compact yet comprehensive test structure to capture all interconnect parasitic in a real chip is needed. To address this problem, this paper describes a set of test structures {{that can be used to}} study the timing performance (i. e. propagation delay and crosstalk) of various interconnect configurations. Moreover, an empirical model is developed to estimate the actual RC parasitic. Compared with the state-of-the-art interconnect test structures, the new structure is compact in size and can be easily embedded on die as a parasitic <b>variation</b> <b>monitor.</b> We have validated the proposed structure on a test chip in TSMC 28 nm HPM process. Recently, the test structure is further modified to identify the serious interconnect process issues for critical path design using TSMC 7 nm FF process...|$|E
40|$|The {{continued}} {{push for}} traditional Silicon technology scaling faces the main challenge of non-scaling power density. Exploring alternative power-efficient technologies {{is essential for}} sustaining technology development. Many emerging technologies have been proposed as potential replacement for Silicon technology. However, these emerging technologies need rigorous evaluation in the contexts of circuits and systems to identify their value prior to commercial investment. We have developed evaluation frameworks covering emerging Boolean logic devices, memory devices, memory systems, and integration technologies. The evaluation metrics are in terms of delay, power, and reliability. According to the evaluation results, the development of emerging Boolean logic devices is still far {{from being able to}} replace Silicon technology, but magnetic random access memory (MRAM) is a promising memory technology showing benefits in performance and energy-efficiency. As a specific example, we co-optimize MRAM with application circuits and systems. Optimized MRAM write and read design can significantly improve the system performance. We have proposed magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) based process and temperature <b>variation</b> <b>monitor,</b> which enables variation-aware MRAM write and read optimization. We have also proposed utilizing negative differential resistance (NDR) to enable fast and energy-efficient write and zero-disturbance read for resistive memories including MRAM. In addition, we also design and adapt MRAM technology into low-power stochastic computing system to improve energy-efficiency. To further improve the stochastic computing system, a promising VC-MTJ based true random stochastic bitstream generator is proposed and utilized...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThree {{methods for}} the {{determination}} of the large-strain behavior of ductile polymers are compared in both tension and compression. Each method relies on some (non-contact) measurement of the strain and some approximations in the calculation of stress. The strain measurement techniques include digital image correlation (DIC) and two techniques of video-based extensometry: marker tracking and area <b>variation</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Since the specimens are inevitably subject to structural plastic instabilities (necking in tension, barreling in compression) the strain and stress states are no longer uniform in the gauge section after the peak load. Under such circumstances, it is demonstrated that the three experimental methods can lead to significant differences. It is inferred from the comparative analysis that the method based on vertical marker tracking is not reliable. Validated by DIC, video-based area variation is shown to be a simple alternative way to obtain an excellent estimate of the intrinsic true stress–strain behavior of the polymer...|$|R

The ambient seismic noise at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano on La Réunion island is analyzed from January 2006 to June 2007. During this period, five eruptions occurred showing a great diversity in eruption duration, intensity and eruptive fissure location. Two different methods are used to compute the velocity variations in order to compare their stability in quasi real-time routine. We compare the obtained velocity variations with the surface deformation observed by GPS and extensometers networks. This allows us to identify and quantify three major processes at the origin of seismic wave velocity variations in the edifice. Firstly, the observed pre-eruptive summit inflation is accompanied by a decrease in seismic velocity. Secondly, the edifice deflation following the opening of an eruptive fissure is characterized by an increase of the velocity. Finally, the summit caldera collapse generates a strong velocity drop.

The obtained time series show a precursory seismicity pattern, characterized by low and high probability periods, which preceded earthquakes of magnitude M ≥ 4. 0.
