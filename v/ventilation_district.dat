40|$|Nowadays, {{energy is}} {{becoming}} more and more important. With the development of society, the demand of energy is also increasing correspondingly. There is 22 % of the total energy which is used in building part. A more effective and sustainable energy system becomes necessary due to increasing energy prices and demand. The aim of this thesis is to make an energy survey of this building, evaluating different sources of energy supply and losses in this building. By evaluating, a better thermal comfort is expectedly achieved when having examinations, and a possible saving method is also expected in order to reduce the cost of this system.  In this project, the building is located in University of Gävle which is surveyed. It has 2 floors. The first floor is underground as a basement. An examination room is included in the second floor. There are a space heating system and heating recovery system ventilation in this examination building. At first step of analysis, the data of construction, <b>ventilation,</b> <b>district</b> heating and hot tap water were arranged by Mr. Magnus. Secondly, an energy balance had been done, and it helped to make energy input and output more clearly. In energy supply part, the solar radiation is 22. 4 MWh, the internal heat from people is 1. 95 MWh, the internal heat from equipment is 5. 63 MWh and district heating is 184 MWh. In energy losses part, the transmission loss is 165 MWh, the mechanical ventilation loss is 38. 3 MWh, the infiltration loss is 8. 38 MWh and the hot tap water is 2. 09 MWh. Thirdly, results of calculations were analyzed. At last, the optimization methods were given to save energy. The optimization methods were changing type of windows and improving indoor temperature which influenced the transmission loss part. Another method was reducing operating time of the ventilation system. Through these optimizing methods, the total energy use is reduced from 214 MWh to 179 MWh, and district heating is reduced from 184 MWh to 149 MWh. District heating of this building is supplied by Gävle Energi company, which is able to save 20 % cost by these optimizing methods. According to the investment analysis, 19 thousand SEK energy is saved per annum...|$|E
40|$|The Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) {{investigated}} ways {{to increase}} mine airflow to underground metal/nonmetal (M/NM) mine working areas to improve miners' health and safety. One of those areas is controlled recirculation. Because the quantity of mine air often cannot be increased, reusing part of the ventilating air {{can be an effective}} alternative, if implemented properly, until the capacity of the present system is improved. The additional airflow can be used to provide effective dilution of contaminants and higher flow velocities in the underground mine environment. Most applications of controlled recirculation involve taking a portion of the return air and passing it back into the intake to increase the air volume delivered to the desired work areas. OMSHR investigated a Nevada gold mine where shaft rehabilitation was in progress and one of the two main fans was shut down to allow reduced air velocity for safe shaft work. Underground booster fan operating pressures were kept constant to maintain airflow to work areas, inducing controlled recirculation in one work zone. Investigation into system behavior and the effects of recirculation on the working area during times of reduced primary ventilation system airflow would provide additional information on implementation of controlled recirculation into the system and how these events affect M/NM ventilation systems. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health monitored the <b>ventilation</b> <b>district</b> when both main fans were operating and another scenario with one of the units turned off for maintenance. Airflow and contaminants were measured to determine the exposure effects of induced recirculation on miner health. Surveys showed that 19 % controlled recirculation created no change in the overall district airflow distribution and a small reduction in district fresh air intake. Total dust levels increased only modestly and respirable dust levels were also low. Diesel particulate matter (DPM) levels showed a high increase in district intake mass flow, but minor increases in exposure levels related to the recirculation percentage. Utilization of DPM mass flow rates allows input into ventilation modeling programs to better understand and plan for ventilation changes and district recirculation effects on miners' health.

50|$|Conditions in {{the mine}} before the {{explosion}} were presented in evidence at the inquiry into the disaster. Firstly underground mine <b>ventilation</b> in some <b>districts</b> of Dennis was probably inadequate; in particular, the 14's and 29's districts were notorious for poor air quality. The main return airway for the 109's, 14's and 29's districts {{was said to be}} 4 ft by 4 ft and far too small to provide adequate ventilation. Secondly, working conditions in the 2600 ft deep 95's and 24's district were always uncomfortably hot. Thirdly there were also numerous breaches of safety regulations such as the firing of explosive charges in 14's district and the failure to take dust samples.|$|R
50|$|The report {{noted that}} before the {{accident}} <b>ventilation</b> in some <b>districts</b> was possibly inadequate: in particular, {{it was noted that}} 14's and 29's districts were poorly ventilated. The report after the accident, considered that the main return airway for the 109's, 14's and 29's districts was far too small at 4 feet by 4 (according to one witness). Evidence was given that 95's and 24's district, at 2,600 feet deep, was uncomfortably hot. There were numerous breaches of regulations regarding the firing of explosive charges in 14's district, taking of dust samples, and other matters. The colliery had made an operating loss in 1933, and the manager, William Bonsall, had been under pressure from the Dennis family to increase profitability. He had spent little time in the Dennis section of the pit in the months before the disaster, as he was overseeing the installation of new machinery in the mine's other section, the South-Eastern or Slant.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} carried out on behalf of IV Produkt AB and intends to set an average ratio of thermal energy losses in {{apartment}} buildings that were built during the 1960 - 1990. This shall be derived by analyzing the total district energy consumption that has been divided into three parts: heat energy losses (the actual heating requirements), the heating of domestic hot water and heating energy consumption for the controlled ventilation. Three different residential areas that were built during the years 1962 - 1966 and one that was built in 1993 has been analyzed. All residential areas are located in Växjö urban and contains between four and six apartment buildings. The analyzed objects have a mechanical exhaust <b>ventilation</b> systems and <b>district</b> heating as the heating method. No own laboratory work or experiments have been done in this thesis, the calculations have been done on the basis of parameters from VEAB, interviews with property managers, and literature studies. By calculations, we have got a result that is reported in Chapter 6. The result is given as a thermal energy loss {{as a percentage of the}} total heat consumption. In this thesis there has also been a review of the rules on requirements for the specific energy consumptions in buildings, indoor environment and indoor temperature from the National Board of Housing and the National Board of Health and Welfare...|$|R
