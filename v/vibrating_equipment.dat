5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} types of work-related injuries is musculoskeletal disorder. Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMDs) result in persistent pain, loss of functional capacity and work disability, but their initial diagnosis is difficult because they are mainly based on complaints of pain and other symptoms.

50|$|An {{alternative}} to the high frequency vibrating screens is the rotary sifter. A rotary sifter uses a screen which rotates in a circular motion and the finer particles are sifted through the apertures. It is also generally used for finger separations; between 12mm to 45μm particle size. The rotary sifter will usually be chosen based {{on the nature of}} the substance being separated; whey, yeast bread mix, cheese powder, fertilizers. The rotary sifter is often preferred in the non-metallurgical industry and operates in a way to achieve a dust and noise free environment. The limitation for the rotary sifter is that it cannot handle a high capacity compared to the high frequency <b>vibrating</b> screen.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. This study {{sought to}} provide data on the {{relationship}} of work exposures to long-term back problems in a population survey. METHODS. The Ontario Health Survey in 1990 used a representative population sample of the province. It included data on long-term back problems, occupational activity, and physical work exposures. The current study examined relationships between these variables. RESULTS. The prevalence of long-term back problems was 7. 8 % in working-age adults. It generally increased with age. Long-term back problems were more prevalent in blue-collar occupations and among those not working, as well as among people with less formal education, smokers, and those overweight. Physical work exposures [...] awkward working position, working with <b>vibrating</b> vehicles or <b>equipment,</b> and bending and lifting [...] were all associated with a greater risk of back problems. The number of simultaneous physical exposures was monotonically related to increased risk. CONCLUSIONS.

40|$|Bulk solids {{handling}} play {{a critical}} role in modern industrial processes. Particulate classification is one aspect of materials (bulk solids) handling, the aim of which is to distinguish unique particles by virtue of predetermined criteria. Construction, foods, mining, pharmaceutical industries, power generation (e. g. the now versatile biomass-based co-generation plants), and waste management etc., often require sorting in terms of size, specific gravity, grain loading, shape, chemical composition, bulk density, resistivity, friability, wettability, cohesiveness, resilience etc., prior to end-use or further utilization in downstream unit operations. Moreover, bulk solids have been a complex material for several decades, as the process is often referred to as ‘not fully understood’. This dissertation is aimed at developing enhanced, and deeply understood methods for modelling the flow of particles during size classification, by incorporating modern study tools, including computer simulations, and experimental designs, targeted at improved processes. One key objective is to understand the dynamics of granular flow in depth, and to find ways to correlate the energy spent, and the efficiency in such solids classification, both with gravity and <b>vibrated</b> screening <b>equipment.</b> This direct link holds the key to a better understanding that may lead to optimal design and operation of particle classification equipment. The second objective is to address the inefficiency caused by operations at high capacity, through further development of the methods of determination of the rates and optimization of classification processes. The final objective is to simplify these models, to make them easy and applicable for rapid prototyping, fabrication and up-scaling in relevant the industries. First order rate law (FORL) has been used for a long time to estimate the rate of particles’ classification during screening. However FORL only calculates the current population of particle (overflow), but does not estimate the difference in particle population, or the underflow. In order to get the passage, the overflow must be subtracted from the original mass or the particle count. Due to this problem, there are only a few mathematical models (apart from someWeibull distribution functions), that can estimate underflow growth from zero. The existence (or non-existence), of such models is usually described as failure, as it censors some useful results. Secondly, FORL does not necessarily relate the moments or rate constants, to the key design parameters of the unit operation, such as screen dimensions and area, aperture sizes and shapes, and transient motion of particles along the sieve lengths in general. These problems present a challenge for, and are a limitation of the FORL, and thus necessitates empirical, or data-driven modelling. In this thesis, all the components of particle population are estimated simultaneously, which seems to be a successful methodology for further development. An attempt is made to link these constants to the design parameters, used in a representative case study on designing the unit operation. An improved theoretical model for the quantification of the rate of classification is postulated, based on discrete and continuum mathematical theories. These models are tested through a prototype screening equipment designed for studying the impacts of feed throughput, flowability, and screen deck declinations on the overall performance of the screen. Two extremes usually exist when considering rheology in fluid flow. Either it is assumed purely compressible or incompressible. Contrary to these assumptions, it is shown in this study that granular flows are divided into two regimes - the continuum constituting the middle of the flow cross-section, and the bulk flow around it. The specific gravity of the particle fluid tend to vary with the position (vector in space) in the continuum, but invariant with time. In the bulk region, however, the specific gravity varies more with time, but less with position, and thus the flow forms a quasi-compressible flow. Granular flow is therefore described in this study as turbulent, unsteady, Newtonian fluid flow (in a wide channel), with nominal to high densities, and generally low dynamic viscosities, and consequently even lower kinematic viscosities. It is therefore incompressible within the core continuum, but compressible around the bulk flow regime. The volume of the continuum changes with space, and thus the density varies only macroscopically, but remains nearly constant microscopically inside the continuum. The flow over the screens is classified as unidirectional subsonic, meaning that the flow velocity is low (<_ 3 : 5 ms - 1) and only in one direction (downslope), giving Mach numbers below 0. 011. On the other hand, when discrete models are considered, granular materials and powders are assumed to be incompressible, dry, non-cohesive, and rigid, in order to allow time averaging of the bulk velocity. Both models result in Newton’s second law for variable masses, whose solution is found analytically and numerically. Obtaining and zeroing the gradient of the fluctuation velocity enables achieving the agitation force requirements in G-force. A close correlation was found between the developed theoretical and simulation models, and experimental results. In general, dense screen loading is the main source of momentum accumulation that increases the underflow rates, rather the capacity in ton per hour, but reduces the flowability, and consequently the efficiency of size classification. For multi-sized screens, it was shown that up to 99. 99 % efficiency can be achieved for gravity separators while operating at low to medium capacity, but the same efficiency can only be achieved operating at low capacities in vibrated screens...|$|R

40|$|In {{structure-borne}} sound problems in buildings, {{knowledge of the}} contact forces between <b>vibrating</b> <b>equipment</b> and a receiving element is often required. When multiplying these forces with the simultaneously measured velocities at the contact points of the equipment, the {{structure-borne sound}} power can be determined, which is the quantity governing the sound energy transfer from a source space to a receiving space.

This technique is already used in the automotive industry, but applications in buildings are rather rare. The installation used is a vibrating platform, which induces tonal, low-frequency vibrations into the building. Therefore, the used sound source has to perform well for low frequencies.

This type of concrete is transported, placed, distributed and finally compacted using heavy road construction equipments. Generally concrete pavements {{are widely used}} for heavy traffic roads and to reduce maintenance. Roller {{compacted concrete}} is placed in layers thin enough to allow complete compaction. The optimum layer thickness ranges from 20 to 30 cm. To ensure adequate bonding between the new & old layer are at cold joint, segregation must be prevented and a high plasticity bedding mix must be used {{at the start of}} the placement. A compressive strength of above 7 Mpa to 30 Mpa have been obtained.

Bernard 1 Corresponding author ([nicole. bernard@mcgill. ca](nicole. bernard@mcgill. ca)). ### INTRODUCTION The {{enzyme-linked}} immunospot (ELISPOT) assay {{measures the}} secretion intensity of effector molecules released by immune cells {{in response to}} ex vivo antigenic stimulation, {{as well as the}} frequency of these responding cells. This assay is highly sensitive, quantitative, easy to use, and amenable to high-throughput screening. For these reasons, the ELISPOT assay is considered by many as a gold standard for monitoring cellular immune responses. Until recently, ELISPOT assays using chromophores to detect the T cell secretion of cytokines were limited to the characterization of a single effector molecule. Notably, studies evaluating the immune response to chronic viral infections often measured IFN-γ secretion by ELISPOT because of the known antiviral effects of this cytokine as well as its correlation to the cytotoxic capacity of T cells. However, maintenance of both IFN-γ and IL- 2 secretion by pathogen-specific T cells has been linked to a more favorable clinical outcome in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Leishmania infections. Therefore, an ELISPOT assay able to simultaneously characterize T cell responses in terms of IL- 2 and IFN-γ secretion is potentially relevant for the monitoring of immune responses to certain infectious agents. In this protocol, we describe an ELISPOT assay for the simultaneous detection of IL- 2 and IFN-γ upon stimulation with viral peptides. ### RELATED INFORMATION Early uses of the ELISPOT assay for studies of immune cell secretion intensity and frequency are described in Currier et al. (2002) and Czerkinsky et al. (1988). The principles of the ELISPOT assay are reviewed in Letsch and Scheibenbogen (2003), and its use in high-throughput screening is described in Hernandez-Fuentes et al. (2003). The pathogen studies by Harari et al. (2005) illustrate the potential utility of simultaneous detection of IFN-γ and IL- 2 secretion for monitoring immune response. Darrah et al. (2007) demonstrate that immune responses secreting IFN-γ and IL- 2 and other cytokines play a protective role in a Leishmania major infection model. The assay presented in this protocol has also been described in Boulet et al. (2007). ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1.

Negative control: 50 μL R 10 medium with no stimulus added. - *Unstimulated cells should give no or few spots in Step 28 *. - iii. Positive control: Anti-CD 3 mAb at a final well concentration of 0. 3 μg/mL. - iv. CEF control: Most individuals respond to this pool of peptides isolated from cytomegalovirus (C), Epstein-Barr virus (E), and influenza virus (F). - v. Peptides from infectious agent: Optimal peptides (8 - to 11 -mers) or 15 -mers are usually recommended. Pools of peptides may be used. Final concentration of the individual peptides or each peptide within a pool should be ~ 4 μg/mL. 14. Retrieve cells from the incubator and pool into a single 50 ‐mL PP tube. Add warm (37 °C) wash medium to fill the tube and remove a 30 -μL aliquot to count PBMCs. 15. Centrifuge cells at 1500 rpm for 7 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in warm (37 °C) R 20 medium at 4 × 10 e 6 cells per mL.

Activate AEC buffer by adding 4. 8 μL of H 2 O 2 to 10 mL of AEC buffer and filter through a 0. 45 -μm filter. Add 100 μL per well of activated AEC buffer to each well and incubate up to 5 - 10 min. 26. Wash the ELISPOT plate: - i. Twice with 200 μL per well of filtered H 2 O, using the VPW. - ii. One minute under running tap H 2 O. Remove the bottom of the ELISPOT plate and wash both sides of the membrane. 27. Air-dry the plates. 28. Take a picture of the wells and count spots using the CTL-Immunospot Analyzer as described by the manufacturer. If a picture of the plates cannot be taken and counted on the same day, keep the plates away from light until it can be done. - *For counting spots, sensitivity and compensation are set using wells coated with either anti-IL- 2 or anti-IFN-γ coating buffer (Step 3), in which cells were stimulated with one of the positive control stimuli, i. e., CEF or anti-CD 3 mAb (Step 13). Wells coated with anti-IL- 2 coating buffer should contain only blue spots. Wells coated with anti-IFN-γ coating buffer should contain only red spots*. - i. Set sensitivity for each color separately, such that a maximum number of spots are detected in each of the anti-IL- 2 or anti-IFN-γ coated wells. - ii. Using the software’s embedded algorithm, set compensation such that no blue spots are detected in the wells coated with anti-IFN-γ coating buffer and that no red spots are detected in the wells coated with anti-IL- 2 coating buffer. - *Using these settings, a spot that represents the footprint of both IFN-γ and IL- 2 secretion appears purple and is detected when the color of a spot meets the threshold at the intersection of both single colors*. - iii. Count the cells in each of the three types of antigen-specific cell populations: single IFN-γ responding cells, single IL- 2 responding cells, and IFN-γ/IL- 2 dual cytokine responding cells. - iv. Always audit the counts obtained from the software well-by-well. *See Troubleshooting*. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: Wells leak coating buffer. **[Step 10]** - **Solution**: Treatment with MeOH in Step 1 may be too long. Make sure exposure of the wells to MeOH is kept to a minimum. If the problem persists, try less concentrated MeOH solutions or replace MeOH with ethanol. - **Problem**: The positive control is weak or negative. **[Step 28]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Avoid using cells for which viability is < 70 % after thawing (Step 8). - 2. Avoid cell stress, such as prolonged exposure to concentrated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), insufficient medium, insufficient CO 2, or prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. - 3. Increase incubation time in Step 23 and/or Step 25. - **Problem**: Spot quality is poor. **[Step 28]** - **Solution**: Spot quality can be affected in several ways: - 1. A spot with a white center is the result of improper washing of the plate during Step 17; cells remain bound to the membrane and create a “ghost” image during development. Make sure plates are washed vigorously. - 2. Double spots or spots with a cobweb appearance result from plate displacement occurring during Step 16. Ensure plates are not moved during incubation and that the incubator is not located in an active area or near <b>vibrating</b> <b>equipment</b> (e. g., a centrifuge). - 3. Spots that are too dark with a black center make compensation with the counting instrument difficult. Reduce incubation time in Step 23 and/or Step 25. - **Problem**: The response to background stimuli is elevated. **[Step 28]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Avoid cell stress (see solution above for the positive control being weak or negative). - 2. Put cells on a shaker during Step 9 to avoid cell clumping. - 3. In wash steps using R 10 and R 20 media, screen lots of fetal bovine serum (FBS) to identify ones supporting low background. Some lots result in increased background and it is recommended that these be tested prior to use. If the problem persists, replace FBS with human AB serum. - 4. Check reagents for contaminants. - 5. Filtration may remove precipitated material that could cause background. ### DISCUSSION Immune monitoring methods have become essential tools for understanding the correlates of protective immune responses. The dual-color ELISPOT assay described in this protocol allows for the simultaneous detection of antigen-specific T cells secreting IFN-γ and/or IL- 2. The rationale for selecting cytokines to target in a dual-color ELISPOT assay may vary based on the experimental question being posed. IFN-γ secretion is an antiviral T cell function that is resistant to functional exhaustion in the course of infections characterized by high persistent antigen load and it is the cytokine most frequently assessed in standard ELISPOT assays used to monitor vaccine trials (Shiver et al. 2002; Wherry et al. 2003; Harari et al. 2005; Hill et al. 2007; Kester et al. 2008). IL- 2 secretion, on the other hand, is sensitive to functional exhaustion in a setting of high persistent antigen load. However, it tends to identify responses that are more likely to be multifunctional, i. e., have the ability to proliferate and effectively control viral replication (Wherry et al. 2003; Harari et al. 2004; Zimmerli et al. 2005). Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) is also used to characterize antigen-specific immune responses. It has the advantage of allowing for extensive phenotyping and functional analyses of the responding cells. However, ICS usually requires a greater number of PBMCs per condition tested, and it is more expensive and less amenable to high-throughput screening than the ELISPOT assay. The ELISPOT assay is at least as sensitive (if not more so) than ICS for detecting antigen-specific cells (Sun et al. 2003; Streek et al. 2009). In resource-limited settings, comprehensive screening with the dual-color ELISPOT could be used to identify specificities that could later be further phenotypically and functionally characterized by multiparametric flow cytometry. Although both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses can be detected with the dual-color ELISPOT, the use of optimal peptides or overlapping 15 -mers usually favors the detection of antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells (Boulet et al. 2007; Ndongala et al. 2009). However, the ELISPOT assay also allows for the stimulation of T cells with complex antigens such as whole proteins, cell lysates, or whole or apoptotic cells. In the case of complex antigens, these would need to be pre-incubated with antigen-presenting cells (APC) (Schmittel et al. 2000). In this case, antigens would be processed by the APC and appropriately presented to CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells, with co-stimulatory signals, according to each cell’s specific requirements. In this context, CD 4 + T cells may be more effectively stimulated and, therefore, their responses more accurately detected. In addition, stimulation of T cells with APCs previously exposed to the antigen may favor the detection of antigen-specific cells that were not previously primed in vivo. If the dual-color ELISPOT protocol is adapted to utilize antigen-pulsed APCs as a stimulus, then the APC-priming procedure and incubation time with the responder cells should be optimized. Another caveat of this method is the decreased magnitude of IFN-γ responses, by ~ 15 %, in wells where both IL- 2 and IFN-γ are captured when compared to wells coated with IFN-γ alone (Boulet et al. 2007). This may be a consequence of the mAb-mediated sequestration of IL- 2, which is a known inducer of IFN-γ. Depending on the type of study undertaken, it is therefore necessary to determine whether the information gained from simultaneously detecting both cytokines outweighs the cost of a decreased IFN‐γ magnitude. The dual-color ELISPOT assay has been used to demonstrate the importance of the link between the predominance of different T cell functional subsets in HIV-infected individuals with different clinical outcomes or at different stages of disease (Peretz et al. 2007; Ndongala et al. 2009). ### REFERENCES 1.
