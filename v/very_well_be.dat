5|$|Encouraged by Villa's and Orozco's actions, {{as well as}} the {{outbreak}} of the Zapatista rebellion in Morelos, Madero crossed back into Mexico in February 1911. After a few minor engagements with units of Diaz's army, Madero, Orozco and Villa decided to attack the federal garrison at Ciudad Juárez. If they could take the city, they would control traffic between Mexico and the US. Furthermore, such a major success by the revolutionaries could <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> the final push that would knock over the Porfiriato.|$|E
5|$|By many general {{criteria}} of mutual intelligibility, the Continental Scandinavian languages could <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> considered dialects {{of a common}} Scandinavian language. However, because of several hundred years of sometimes quite intense rivalry between Denmark and Sweden, including {{a long series of}} wars from the 16th to 18th centuries, and the nationalist ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the languages have separate orthographies, dictionaries, grammars, and regulatory bodies. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a dialect continuum of Scandinavian (North Germanic), and some of the dialects, such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden, especially parts of Bohuslän, Dalsland, western Värmland, western Dalarna, Härjedalen, Jämtland and Scania, could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages.|$|E

The anclabris is depicted as if it were made out of marble, and two sphinxes—beings that serve as allegories for the secrets and mysteries of the Dionysian cult—are supporting the table. On the anclabris stands a small statue of Hermes, next to which hangs a mask with pipes. Above this mask may <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> the raven of Apollo. On {{the left side of the}} table, a goat is seen resting on the ground, surrounded by the symbols of the cult. Finally, a wicker basket can be found to the right of the table, out of which a snake emerges; this basket motif is often found in Dionysian artwork, and seemingly was an object of great importance to the religion.|$|E

25|$|The origin {{behind the}} hydronym 'Wear' is {{uncertain}} but is generally {{understood to be}} Celtic.

The name 'Wear' has also been explained as being an ancient Celtic name meaning 'river of blood'.|$|E
25|$|According to Glazer (1980, p.111), from 15 May 1948 onwards, {{expulsion}} of Palestinians became a regular practice.

25|$|Prevalence {{estimates}} {{place the}} number of people with PBA between 1.5 and 2million in the United States alone, which would be less than 1% of the U.S. population even at {{the high end of the}} estimate. Some argue that the number is probably higher and that clinicians underdiagnose PBA. However, the prevalence estimate of 2million is based on an online survey. Self-selected computer-savvy patients in at-risk groups evaluated their own symptoms and submitted their self-diagnoses. No doctor or clinic confirmed the data. Motivation to participate could have been influenced by the presence of symptoms, which would have skewed the results. The actual prevalence could <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> quite a bit lower than estimated.|$|E

25|$|While Turing's proof {{shows that}} there can be no general method or {{algorithm}} to determine whether algorithms halt, individual instances of that problem may <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> susceptible to attack. Given a specific algorithm, one can often show that it must halt for any input, and in fact computer scientists often do just that as part of a correctness proof. But each proof has to be developed specifically for the algorithm at hand; there is no mechanical, general way to determine whether algorithms on a Turing machine halt. However, there are some heuristics that can be used in an automated fashion to attempt to construct a proof, which succeed frequently on typical programs. This field of research is known as automated termination analysis.|$|E
25|$|In {{many places}} {{throughout}} the Hebrew Scriptures – particularly the Book of Hosea – Israel is figured as Yahweh's wife or bride. Malachi's discussion of divorce {{may also be}} understood to conform to this metaphor. Malachi could <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> urging his audience not to break faith with Yahweh (the God of Israel) by adopting new gods or idols. It is quite likely that, since the people of Judah were questioning Yahweh's love and justice (1:2, 2:17), they {{might be tempted to}} adopt foreign gods. William LaSor suggests that, because the restoration to the land of Judah had not resulted in anything like the prophesied splendor of the messianic age which had been prophesied, the people were becoming quite disillusioned with their religion.|$|E

An episode in season 2 even featured a vision of an alternate reality where instead of being a physical therapist, Bruce was a reverend who never met Johnny after waking up from his coma. And thus, with the absence of his guidance, this version of Johnny became unstable, deranged, and driven mad by his abilities.|$|E

However, the tables were turned once more and in the 2004 NBA Playoffs the Kings defeated the Mavericks once again four games to one in the quarterfinals with dominating performances from. Since that time, free agency and trades would dull the rivalry and the teams haven't met in the playoffs since.|$|E
