50|$|The <b>veneer</b> <b>saw</b> {{is a small}} {{double-edged}} {{tool for}} cutting thin hardwood veneer. Its narrow curved blade facilitates precision work, and its elevated offset handle {{makes it possible to}} cut flush with a surface. The blade is usually 3 or 4 inches long and it has 13 tpi (teeth per inch).|$|E
5000|$|When {{used for}} {{different}} purposes may have other {{names such as}} for converting logs into lumber they are also called a pit-saw or whipsaw and for sawing veneer may simply be called a <b>veneer</b> <b>saw.</b> It is unknown how early framed pit-saws came into use however there is an Italian fresco from [...] depicting their use.|$|E
50|$|A French flush-cut saw is a {{double-edged}} tool, {{similar to a}} <b>veneer</b> <b>saw,</b> that is designed for trimming the ends of dowels, tenons, and other protusions flush with a surface. The blade usually has 11 teeth per inch on one side, and 20 teeth per inch on the other side, making it more versatile than other flush-cutting saws. The blade is approximately 6 inches long, {{and in order to}} avoid marring the surface, the saw teeth are angled slightly upward.|$|E
50|$|Types of {{hand saws}} {{used to make}} rip cuts are rip saws, frame saws {{some of which are}} whipsaws, and <b>veneer</b> <b>saws.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{prevent the}} body of the blade binding and for other {{enhancements}} to the cutting action, the teeth can be set (angled out) from the blade. Teeth can be set in several patterns: single-sided set, alternating set or a patterned set. Most Western and Asian handsaws use an alternating set, whereby a tooth is set the opposite direction from the preceding one. Specialized tools like <b>veneer</b> <b>saws</b> or flush-cut saws may be set only to one side. Some hacksaws and machine saw blades have patterned sets that may require specially designed saw sets to create.|$|R
40|$|A novel wood-based {{composite}} {{has been}} developed for use in structural applications. The process was designed to utilize rapidly-grown, low density, wood species. Plantation grown radiata pine is particularly well suited to this process. This is a laminated composite, where the lamina may be comprised of various materials, {{some of which have}} been treated with the viscoelastic thermal compression (VTC) process. The VTC process increases the density of wood, without causing fractures in the cell wall, thus increasing strength and stiffness of the wood material. The process may be applied to <b>veneer,</b> <b>sawn</b> wood, or strand composites. The VTC lamina is then bonded to other lamina to produce the final product. The strength and stiffness of this VTC composite exceeds any wood-based composite that is currently on the market. For example, modulus of elasticity in bending of over 20 GPa is easily obtainabl...|$|R
40|$|Eucalypts are {{renowned for}} their high growth stress levels. These {{stresses}} cause splitting, warping and dimensional instability when cutting, processing and drying the wood. In Chile, large Eucalyptus nitens plantations can be found, which, due to these problems, are scarcely utilised for solid wood products (<b>veneer,</b> <b>sawn</b> wood). This study aims {{to determine the}} factors influencing growth stress {{at different stages of}} tree’s development, and to identify whether the factors influencing growth stress change over time. In five stands of different ages, growth strain, as an indicator of growth stress, was measured at different tree heights with the single hole drilling method. The tree variables DBH, tree height, slenderness (height/diameter ratio) and crown parameters also were measured. A correlation analysis of tree variables and growth strains was undertaken. The results obtained indicate a high variability in growth strain values. It was concluded that growth strain is not correlated with a single growth parameter, but with a combination of factors that variously influence it at different ages and tree heights...|$|R
50|$|Techniques of wood {{marquetry}} {{were developed in}} Antwerp and other Flemish centers of luxury cabinet-making during the early 16th century. The craft was imported full-blown to France after the mid-seventeenth century, to create furniture of unprecedented luxury being made at the royal manufactory of the Gobelins, charged with providing furnishings to decorate Versailles and the other royal residences of Louis XIV. Early masters of French marquetry were the Fleming Pierre Golle and his son-in-law, André-Charles Boulle, who founded a dynasty of royal and Parisian cabinet-makers (ébénistes) and gave his name to a technique of marquetry employing tortoiseshell and brass with pewter in arabesque or intricately foliate designs. Boulle marquetry dropped out of favor in the 1720s, but was revived in the 1780s. In the decades between, carefully matched quarter-sawn <b>veneers</b> <b>sawn</b> from the same piece of timber were arranged symmetrically on case pieces and contrasted with gilt-bronze mounts. Floral marquetry came into favor in Parisian furniture in the 1750s, employed by cabinet-makers like Bernard van Risenbergh, Jean-Pierre Latz and Simon-François Oeben. The most famous royal French furniture veneered with marquetry are the pieces delivered by Jean Henri Riesener in the 1770s and 1780s. The Bureau du Roi was the most famous amongst these famous masterpieces.|$|R
30|$|The {{value of}} {{hardwood}} lumber is {{inversely proportional to}} the quantity and size of its defects, both internal and external. Hardwood, therefore has an appearance-based value. Due to this, log breakdown strategies tend to minimize defects in the resulting boards. Therefore, knowledge of internal defects in hardwood logs prior to log breakdown can be useful. It is in the log yard where the first important decision is made regarding the final use of the log. Based upon the external log characteristics, logs may be sorted as <b>veneer</b> logs, <b>saw</b> logs or pulpwood.|$|R
50|$|Historically <b>veneers</b> {{were also}} <b>sawn,</b> {{but this is}} more {{wasteful}} of wood. Veneering is an ancient art, dating back to at least the ancient Egyptians who used expensive and rare wood veneers over cheaper timbers to produce their furniture and sarcophagi. During the Roman Empire, Romans also used veneered work in mass quantities.|$|R
2500|$|The {{family was}} prosperous and ostensibly happy, {{but behind the}} <b>veneer,</b> Winnicott <b>saw</b> himself as oppressed by his mother, who tended toward depression, {{as well as by}} his two sisters and his nanny. He would {{eventually}} speak of 'his own early childhood experience of trying to make [...] "my living" [...] by keeping his mother alive'. His father's influence was that of an enterprising freethinker who encouraged his son's creativity. Winnicott described himself as a disturbed adolescent, reacting against his own self-restraining [...] "goodness" [...] acquired from trying to assuage the dark moods of his mother. These seeds of self-awareness became the basis of his interest in working with troubled young people.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Astronium graveolens Jacq., also {{commonly}} known as "Gateado" or "Gateado Galán," is a timber tree often used for making fine furniture, decorative sliced <b>veneer,</b> <b>sawn,</b> keels and long structures such as beams and trusses posts (1 - 2). The species are used in Brazilian folk medicine to treat allergies, inflammation, diarrhea and ulcers. Previous phytochemical studies report the presence of gallotannins as galloylglucose compounds, trans-ocimene (3) and flavonoids. In this work, we reported the isolation of known compounds as chlorogenic acid, quercitrin, quercetin 3 -O-glucoside (4) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose (5). Studies report an interesting anti-angiogenic activity for 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose (6), we evaluated its ability to bind and inhibit the Human Placental Growth Factor (hPlGF), a key mediator of pathological angiogenesis. Materials and Methods. The leaves of Astronium graveolens collected (July 2010) at the Experimental Station "Caparo,― Barinas State, Venezuela were defatted with n-hexane and successively extracted for 48 h with chloroform and and methanol, to give 8. 5, 8. 0 and 8. 3 g of the respective residues. A portion of methanol extract (2. 5 g), was chromatographed on Sephadex LH- 20 using MeOH as eluent. A total of 106 fractions were collected (8 ml each) and combined by TLC results on silica 60 F 254 gel-coated glass sheets with n-BuOH–AcOH–H 2 O (60 : 15 : 25) and CHCl 3 –MeOH–H 2 O (40 : 9 : 1), to give 11 pooled fractions (A–K). The fractions more interesting were purified by RP-HPLC. The structures of isolated compounds were elucidated by 1 D- and 2 D-NMR Spectroscopy (1 H, 13 C, 13 C DEPT, DQF-COSY, HSQC, HMBC, ROESY) and confirmed by mass spectrometry studies. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) was used to study the interaction of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose and the h-PlGF binding to its receptor (h-VEGF-R 1 or h-Flt- 1); the concentrations are: 0, 5 mg for h-Flt- 1, 10 ng for h-PlGF, 0, 5 mg for the biotinylated antibody and 200, 100, 50, 25, 12, 5, 6, 25, 3, 12 μM for the natural compound. Finally, we measured the binding affinity between 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose and h-PlGF with surface plasmon resonance assays, using Biacore technology. Results and Discussion. The phytochemical study of methanol extract led to isolation of phenolic compounds as chlorogenic acid, quercitrin, quercetin 3 -O-glucoside (4) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose (5). The competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose is able to reduce by 58...|$|R
50|$|The {{house was}} built in 1807 by James Rundlet, who {{acquired}} his wealth in the textile trade.

40|$|International audienceContext: Woodcutting is a {{very old}} {{technology}} but scientific research is scarce on the subject. In the last 50 years much work on basic mechanisms as well as industrial processes {{has been done in}} France. Aims: The specific nature of wood introduces strong differences between wood and metal cutting processes. The paper focuses on French teams' contributions. Results: The basic aspects of the tool–material interaction for different basic modes in woodcutting are highlighted. In primary conversion such as <b>sawing,</b> <b>veneer</b> cutting or green wood chipping, huge progress comes from automation and the possibility of linking the process to log and product quality through new sensors. In secondary processing much has been done on the links between the cutting process, surface qualification and the properties of these surfaces for further processing, such as gluing or coating. Tool wear depends on the cutting process, timber quality, and species. Trade-offs are required in tool technology and coating technologies may improve tool life. Conclusion: A large amount of knowledge and innovation has come from 50 years of worldwide research effort, with France being particularly active in this period. The transfer of skills from metals cutting industry was often a key, but much is needed to move closer to both metal cutting sector and woodcutting skills among craftsmen...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{potential}} of infrared (IR) technology in estimating the moisture content (MC) of birch (Betula pendula Roth) veneer was investigated. A total of 56 birch veneer sheets (42 × 130 cm 2) were dried with a convective type laboratory-scale veneer dryer at drying times ranging from 1 to 6 min at 1 min intervals. After drying, IR data were recorded and the <b>veneer</b> sheets were <b>sawn</b> into 100 × 100 mm 2 pieces. IR data were averaged {{over the same}} area and then the true MC and density values were assessed gravimetrically. The dependency between temperature and MC {{was found to be}} non-linear and between temperature and density there was no dependency. The relationship between temperature and MC was modeled with a neural network and a Gaussian model. Both model types gave similar results. At a true MC below 10 %, the root mean square error of prediction (RMSE) was 1. 5 % for the 100 × 100 mm 2 pieces and 1. 2 %, for the larger veneer sheets, whereas at higher MC (above 10 %), the RMSE increased to 2. 6 % for the 100 × 100 mm 2 pieces and 1. 9 % for the sheets. It was observed that the IR measurement should be taken within 5 s, since after that the RMSE increased rapidly. Based on the results of this study, it was concluded that veneer MC can be estimated with reasonably good accuracy using IR technology...|$|R

40|$|During {{the first}} year of the program I will be working on designs for {{domestic}} use made according to the simple guidelines of modern design. That is that the items be, functional, durable, aesthetically pleasing, of reasonable cost and quality. I would like to develop a related range of furniture, which accords with the way in which I would like these items to be made for myself. As I do not feel that I have particularly unusual needs I hope that some of these pieces will have commercial potential. In addition I will work on drawings and ideas for the work I would like to do in the second year. During the second year I will work on some larger pieces which address some of the concerns of theory and practice with which I am grappling. I would hope to develop these pieces as expressive both of the technical and resource problems in which I am interested (use of minor species timbers, the possibilities of <b>sawn</b> <b>veneer,</b> the aesthetics of combinations of materials) and that the works should be expressive emotively. I am interested in developing work which has a distinct emotional quality, not that it would be particularly disturbing, but that it provokes a response. To a certain extent furniture is regarded like air conditioning in that if you don't notice it then it must be working. Whilst I do not want to simply do the opposite; there are certain characteristics of furniture which have strong emotional connotations, drawers and secrecy, chairs and comfort, desks and efficiency, shelves and order, I would like to play around with some of these qualities to produce a different response to the typical...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{clusters}} are {{a worldwide}} phenomenon and a vital economic development strategy. The approach is defined {{to be an}} interrelationship between its participants, suppliers and related industries that produce synergy in a particular location. Clustering has become to be a crucial feature in nation’s economic development. However, the approach {{has not yet been}} studied widely in Sub-Saharan African countries and the existing number of empirical studies are limited. Therefore, this leaves a gap for an up-to-date study to investigate the possibilities of developing an efficient forest industry cluster in Angola. The {{purpose of the study was}} to critically assess and to define the potential of different wood processing industries in connection to develop an efficient forest industry cluster in the Province of Huambo. The objective was to create a comprehensive picture of the existing market situation through a field study and to develop the future concept of wood processing industries. Research methods were qualitative in the empirical part of the study and quantitative in the investment calculations. The primary data were collected through a semi-structured field interviews and observations of existing operators. Interviews were conducted in January and February 2017 to obtain knowledge about the prevailing market situation and about the existing wood product manufacturers. The data were collected with nine interviews, which were transcribed. Pictures and video clips were recorded to support the observations from the factories in the data collection. Based on the field study and observations, investment alternatives were decided and calculated to different wood processing industries. Profitability of the investments were calculated with the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Multiple of Invested Capital (MOIC) and Wood Paying Capability (WPC) at stumpage. Attention was paid to the uncertainty in the calculations with the help of sensitivity analysis. The literature review was based on the cluster theory, collective efficiency and the capital expenditure projects. As a result of this study, an investment model was developed in a shape of a cluster. The cluster model contains five different dimensions: sustainable plantation forestry, production of primary wood products, production of secondary wood products, wood residues sufficient utilization and production of sustainable energy. This study suggests that <b>veneer</b> peeling and <b>sawn</b> timber production could be selected for the primary wood production, carpentry and furniture for the secondary processing and wood residues to produce sustainable energy. The corresponded 10 -year investments NPVs varied from USD 606 000 to USD 974 000 at an interest rate of 15 %. The maximum IRR achieved was 31. 6 % and the minimum was 16. 8 %. The highest WPC at stumpage achieved was USD 69. 8 and the lowest was USD 44. 1. The MOIC ranged between 2. 4 and 4. 0 times the invested capital. This study suggests that the Company could develop an efficient forest industry cluster around veneer peeling with the support from other wood processing industries to the region...|$|R
