5|$|Some sources, {{including}} the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in the F <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> work, state that Æthelred was transferred in 870 from the Bishopric of Wiltshire to the see of Canterbury.

Although the story of his transfer is false, Æthelred was consecrated as archbishop in 870. Why he was selected for Canterbury is unknown, as there is no contemporary information on his election.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the various extant manuscripts is complex, and a definitive scheme of how the various manuscripts {{relate to each other}} cannot be made. Blake, in his edition of the Liber, suggests that Book I once existed as a stand-alone work, which influenced the B manuscript. A separate Book II, with parts of Book III, was then written and combined with the stand-alone Book I, into either manuscript E or an earlier <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> manuscript. Book II was then revised, combined with parts of G, Book I, and parts of E to make manuscript F.|$|E

5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain {{forms the}} final {{part of an}} {{unofficial}} trilogy with Moonlight Syndrome, a spin-off of the Twilight Syndrome series Suda's final work for Human Entertainment, and The Silver Case. According to Suda, while they use the same setting and have some recurring characters, there is otherwise no connection. Despite acting as a sequel to The Silver Case, and featuring a <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> game's protagonist Sumio Kodai, the story was almost completely unrelated {{to the events of}} The Silver Case. This approach was inspired by the Star System utilized by manga artist Osamu Tezuka. The opening scene, where Mondo drives his car towards the island, was put into the game to both introduce Mondo's character to newcomers, and to throw players of The Silver Case off guard and confirm Mondo's two different identities in the two games. It also helped establish the setting and get the player used to Mondo's point of view. His portable computer Catherine, stored in a suitcase, was a reference to the events of The Silver Case due to earlier events being concentrated within it. Despite this, its silver color was coincidental rather than a deliberate reference to the previous game's title.|$|E
5|$|In the Jamiltepec {{region of}} Mexico, there exists {{perhaps the most}} {{colorful}} <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> kind of dance, the Chareos dance. It represents a battle between Moors, led by Pilate, and Christians, led by James, the apostle. Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer who plays the part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, white cotton square over their shoulders, velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete. In addition, the leader has a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two red flags and two white flags, red symbolizing the blood spilt by James' soldiers and white symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory. The sounds of drums and flutes accompany the dance. These dances that pit Christian against Moor are almost certainly Christianized versions of earlier, pre-Cortez dances that ritualized the battle between the tiger and the eagle.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system of}} Mortal Kombat II is an improved <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> {{from the original}} Mortal Kombat. There are several changes in standard moves: a crouching punch and turnaround kick are added, low and high kicks have greater differentiation (be they crouching or standing up), the roundhouse kick are made more powerful (knocking an opponent across the screen, like the game's uppercut), and {{it is easier to}} perform a combo due to reduced recovery times for attacks. Returning characters also gained new special moves, including some to be used in mid-air, and the game plays almost twice as fast as the original. However, all playable characters in the game still share most generic attributes (such as power and jump height) and all normal moves are also the same between each character.|$|E
