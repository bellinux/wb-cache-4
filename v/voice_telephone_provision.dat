40|$|Using econometric methods, this {{analysis}} develops quantity impacts of impediments {{to trade in}} <b>voice</b> <b>telephone</b> services, focusing on the perspective of negotiated agreements. These impacts, estimated {{on the basis of}} market, demographic, and policy variables, establish a baseline from which the achievements of future trade rounds, including the Doha Round, could be compared. In a departure from previous literature in this area, this article draws on documents appended or pertaining to the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) to identify barriers to trade in <b>voice</b> <b>telephone</b> services, and to estimate quantity impacts on this basis. The article finds that market access and national treatment commitments scheduled by WTO members under the GATS, when complemented by commitments to pro-competitive regulatory disciplines, may be formulated into meaningful policy variables. These policy variables are found to be statistically significant in explaining market penetration in <b>voice</b> <b>telephone</b> services, as are variables for income and private sector ownership. ...|$|R

40|$|Now {{part of many}} {{regional}} market places, telecentres are {{a new way to}} provide universal access to ICTs in rural areas. A telecentre provides public and private information-based services, such as <b>voice</b> <b>telephone,</b> fax, email, Internet access, tele-medicine (where a patient can consult a doctor elsewhere in the world), ICT training and agricultural and market information. In South Africa, telecentres are a key component in the government's USA Universal Service Agency. In Senegal, there are more than 4, 000 privately-run telecentres, under license from the telephone company. In Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique, Mali and Benin, pilot projects are underway. At the 1998 ITU World Telecommunications Development Conference in Malta, women delegates from Suriname and Kenya urged for rural telecentres to be accessible to and managed by women's groups.

ADSL is generally only installed for short distances from the telephone exchange (the last mile), typically less than 4 km, but has been known to exceed 8 km if the originally laid wire gauge allows for further distribution.|$|R
