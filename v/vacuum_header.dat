40|$|As {{part of the}} {{plutonium}} stabilization operations in the 234 - 5 Z Building, several runs of 26 -inch (26 inches of Hg) process <b>vacuum</b> <b>header,</b> along with associated smaller piping is to be cut into sections and disposed of. This criticality safety evaluation report (CSER) requested by Nirider (1996) addresses the removal of several hundred feet of abandoned 3 and 4 inch nominal diameter <b>vacuum</b> <b>header</b> and associated smaller diameter piping runs located in the duct level of the 234 - 5 Z Building in rooms 262, 263, and 264 {{as shown in the}} two attached drawings...|$|E
40|$|The HC- 4, HC- 7, HC- 227 s and {{the tank}} 50 High Level Liquid {{detection}} interlock systems detect {{the potential for}} a liquid up take into the 26 inch Vacuum Headers. All of the detectors are well upstream of the 26 inch Vacuum Liquid Detection system that is designed to prevent a criticality due to liquid uptake. Failure of any of the four glovebox liquid detection systems would not impact the operation of the 26 inch Vacuum Liquid Detection system. The systems are completely separate. The liquid detectors and interlocks were installed after an incident in HC- 227 s resulted in a significant volume of RMC feed grade plutonium solution to be drawn out of the glovebox and into the <b>vacuum</b> <b>header.</b> The vacuum trap liquid detection interlock system operability is verified by a weekly functional test per maintenance procedure 2222124. Removal of the HC- 7 Liquid Detection Interlock system from the WHC-SD-CP-SDD- 013 document will not impact this maintenance procedure...|$|E
5000|$|Switching from an exhaust {{manifold}} to exhaust headers (also known as extractors in Australia) will optimize the {{exhaust gas flow}} speed and in turn increase the high-end power of the engine. This is done by using an individual pipe for each exhaust port that has smoother bends with a larger turn radius, decreasing airflow resistance, {{as well as a}} calculated pipe diameter to obtain a good scavenging effect for the specific engine capacity. The pipes then merge into a collector and then flow into a larger pipe (down pipe), just before the catalytic converter. With equal length headers, as each exhaust valve in the head of the engine is opened and exhaust gas is forced out, it passes down one of the header pipes and through to the down pipe, where the exhaust gas velocity causes a slight <b>vacuum</b> in another <b>header</b> pipe. This has an effect of scavenging exhaust gas from the cylinder, which is beneficial for performance. In performance engines, which have cam overlap, the scavenging effect will pull air through from the intake manifold as well, further increasing performance. The length of exhaust headers can be tuned to perform best at specific RPM ranges. Stock {{exhaust manifold}}s are usually made of cast iron and can be restrictive. Headers may or may not increase the dB level of the exhaust, depending on the original exhaust manifold it replaces and the engine. However, the pipes do [...] "ring" [...] with the exhaust pulses and increase underhood noise. Headers can be ceramic coated to reduce the heat radiated in the engine compartment, and to increase the temperature of the pipes which increases the velocity of the exhaust gases.|$|R
