For this study an experimental set up of the system was constructed to achieve the centrifugal pump performances such as H-Q, η-Q, P-Q curves and operating points which interact between performance and system curves. In the <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> system, a vector controlled inverter driving (variable voltage variable frequency) was installed in the experimental system. A numerical investigation also applied for getting the pump performances for the validation and reliability of the pump design development and also the pressure and velocity effects in internal flows of the pump are analyzed. For the numerical analysis, the Navier-Stokes equations were discretized by the finite volume method and two equations transport turbulence (SST) model accounts for three dimensional steady flows.
