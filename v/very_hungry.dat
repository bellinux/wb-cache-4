5|$|Sir John Tenniel drew {{a famous}} {{illustration}} of Alice meeting a caterpillar for Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, c. 1865. The caterpillar is {{seated on a}} toadstool and is smoking a hookah; the image {{can be read as}} showing either the forelegs of the larva, or as suggesting a face with protruding nose and chin. Eric Carle's children's book The <b>Very</b> <b>Hungry</b> Caterpillar portrays the larva as an extraordinarily hungry animal, while also teaching children how to count (to five) and the days of the week.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 5 of the Varaha Upanishad is {{dedicated}} to Yoga, as a discussion between Ribhu and his student Nidagha. There are three types of Yoga, states the text, and these are Laya (soft), Mantra (mystic), and Hatha (middle), recommending Hatha Yoga as foremost of three. It discusses various aspects of Yoga, ranging from recommending that healthy food should be eaten in temperate quantities, in small portions, several times a day, to recommending that Yoga should not be performed when one is not feeling well or is <b>very</b> <b>hungry.</b> The goal of Yoga, states Varaha, is manifold, including the gain of body strength and suppleness, acquisition of knowledge of one's own body and its auras, meditation, and Self (soul) knowledge.|$|E

25|$|For {{the next}} several years Sara is abused by Miss Minchin and the other servants, except for Becky. Amelia deplores how Sara is treated but is too weak to speak up about it. Sara is starved, worked for long hours, sent out in all weathers, poorly dressed in outgrown and {{worn-out}} clothes, and deprived of warmth or a comfortable bed in the attic. Despite her hardships, Sara is consoled by her friends and uses her imagination to cope, pretending she is a prisoner in the Bastille or a princess disguised as a servant. Sara also continues to be kind and polite to everyone, including those who treat her badly. One day she finds a coin in the street and uses it to buy buns at a bakery, but despite being <b>very</b> <b>hungry,</b> she gives most of the buns away to a beggar girl dressed in rags who is hungrier than herself. The bakery shop owner sees this and wants to reward Sara, but she has disappeared, so the shop owner instead gives the beggar girl bread and warm shelter for Sara's sake.|$|E
500|$|After {{his release}} by Hull, Donaldson was spoken to by Barrow, but {{was signed by}} Conference National club York City on 23 June 2005, with manager Billy McEwan saying: [...] "He's a young player who is <b>very</b> <b>hungry</b> for his chance and he'll bring {{competition}} up front". He made his debut in a 0–0 home draw with Crawley Town on 13 August 2005. His first goal came in a 1–0 win against Cambridge United on 2 September 2005. Picking the ball up on the half-way line, he ran past two opposition defenders on the left wing before shooting {{the ball into the}} bottom-right corner from outside the penalty area. During 2005–06, Donaldson scored 18 goals for York and was awarded the Clubman of the Year award, voted for by the club's supporters, before the final match of the season against Hereford United on 29 April 2006. He agreed a contract extension with York for 2006–07 in July 2006.|$|E

But rather than flying {{to a place of}} safety among the Spanish inhabitants of the island the gansas fly higher and higher. On the first day of his flight Gonsales encounters [...] "illusions of 'Devils and Wicked Spirits in the shape of men and women, some of whom he is able to converse with.

Gonsales declines their offer, and after a journey of 12 days reaches the Moon. Suddenly feeling <b>very</b> <b>hungry</b> he opens the provisions he was given en route, only to find nothing but dry leaves, goat's hair and animal dung, and that his wine [...] "stunk like Horse-piss". He is soon discovered by the inhabitants of the Moon, the Lunars, whom he finds to be tall Christian people enjoying a happy and carefree life in a kind of pastoral paradise. Gonsales discovers that order is maintained in this apparently utopian state by swapping delinquent children with terrestrial children.|$|E

2500|$|During a 2004 interview, Ehrlich {{answered}} {{questions about the}} predictions he made in The Population Bomb. He acknowledged that {{some of what he}} had published had not occurred, but reaffirmed his basic opinion that overpopulation is a major problem. He noted that, [...] "Fifty-eight academies of science said that same thing in 1994, as did the world scientists' warning to humanity in the same year. My view has become depressingly mainline!" [...] Ehrlich also stated that 600 million people were <b>very</b> <b>hungry,</b> billions were under-nourished, and that his predictions about disease and climate change were essentially correct.

Speakers remembered Rogers' love of children, devotion to his religion, enthusiasm for music, and quirks.

2500|$|The former {{rich man}} {{found it hard}} having so many mouths to feed. So he made a plan to abandon his daughters in the forest. He hid this plan from his wife but his {{youngest}} daughter named Phao heard about it. When their father left them alone in the deep forest, the twelve girls {{were able to find}} their way back home thanks to their younger sister who had left marks in the path. But their father tried again and this time they were not able to find their way back home. They spent days walking deeper and deeper into the forest and became <b>very</b> <b>hungry.</b> Their father had given them twelve packets of rice, but when they opened them they found out that eleven of them were filled with sand and only one had rice in it. They shared that little rice and ate it crying, lamenting their misfortune. Wandering aimlessly the twelve girls came to a lake, where they tried to catch fish to satiate their hunger. Each of the sisters succeeded in catching a fish and eleven of them playfully poked the eyes of their fish with sharp twigs, except for the youngest one who poked only one eye.|$|E

2500|$|Jones {{was always}} {{prepared}} {{to adapt to}} changing tastes. In 1950, when America was nostalgically {{looking back at the}} 1920s, Jones recorded an album of Charleston arrangements. In 1953 he responded to the growing market for children's records, with tunes aimed directly at kids (like [...] "Socko, the Smallest Snowball"). Jones had become unhappy at RCA Victor and left the label in 1955. His later recordings were issued by Verve, Liberty and Warner Bros. In 1956 Jones supervised an album of Christmas songs, many of which were performed seriously. In 1957, noting the television success of Lawrence Welk and his dance band, he revamped his own act for television. Gone was the old City Slickers mayhem, replaced by a more straightforward big-band sound, with tongue-in-cheek comic moments. The new band was known as Spike Jones and the Band that Plays for Fun.The last City Slickers record was the LP Dinner Music for People Who Aren't <b>Very</b> <b>Hungry.</b> The whole field of comedy records changed from musical satires to spoken-word comedy (Bob Newhart, Mort Sahl, Stan Freberg). Spike Jones adapted to this, too; most of his later albums are spoken-word comedy, including the horror-genre sendup Spike Jones in Stereo (1959) and the send-up of television programs of the period in Omnibust (1960). Jones remained topical to the last: his final group, Spike Jones's New Band, recorded four LPs of brassy renditions of pop-folk tunes of the 1960s (including [...] "Washington Square" [...] and [...] "The Ballad of Jed Clampett"). One of his New Band tracks in 1964 was a cover of [...] "Dominique", a hit by The Singing Nun, in which he not only plays part of the melody on a banjo but melds the melody successfully with [...] "When the Saints Go Marching In!" ...|$|E
