It is shown that a Sagnac-interferometer gravitational-wave detector is a speed meter and therefore in principle it can beat the SQL by large amounts over a wide band of frequencies. It is shown, further, that, when one ignores optical losses, a signal-recycled Sagnac interferometer with Fabry-Perot arm cavities has precisely the same performance, for the same circulating light power, as the Michelson speed-meter interferometer recently invented and studied by P.

40|$|The word “radar ” is {{an acronym}} for “radio {{detection}} and ranging. ” A radar measures the distance, or range, to an object by transmitting an electromagnetic signal to and receiving an echo reflected from the object. Since electromagnetic waves propagate {{at the speed of}} light, one only has to measure the time it takes the radar signal to propagate to the object and back to calculate the range to the object. The total distance traveled by the signal is twice the distance between the radar and the object, since the signal travels from the radar to the object and then back from the object to the radar after reflection. Therefore, once we measured the propagation time (t), we can easily calculate the range (R) as R = 1 ct (1 - 1) 2 where c is the speed of light in a <b>vacuum.</b> The <b>factor</b> 1 / 2 accounts {{for the fact that the}} radar signal actually traveled twice the distance measured: first from the radar to the object and then from the object to the radar. If the electric property of the propagation medium is different from that of the vacuum, the actual propagation velocity has to be estimated for advanced radar techniques, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry. Radars provide their own signals to detect the presence of objects. Therefore, radars are known as active, remote-sensing instruments. Because radars provide their own signal, they can operate during day or night. In addition, radar signal...|$|R
40|$|We derive three {{alternative}} formulas for the {{refracted ray}} direction in ray tracing {{in order to}} prove their equivalence and to demonstrate the process of translating physical laws into optimized computational formulas. It is common knowledge that light rays refract when they strike aninterface between two different transparent media, such as air-water, air-glass, or glass-water. In 1621 Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snell discovered a formula quantifying this observation: the ratio of the sines of the incident and refracted angles equals the ratio of the indices of refraction of the two materials. Snell’s law is: η 1 sin θ 1 = η 2 sin θ 2 where θ 1 is the angle of incidence, θ 2 is the angle of refraction (both measured from the perpendicular to the interface) and η 1 and η 2 are the two indices of refraction on the incident and refracted sides of the interface, respectively. Light passing through a material slows relative to its speed in a <b>vacuum</b> by a <b>factor</b> equal to the index of refraction of that material.

40|$|Adhesion forces between submicrometer-sized {{silicate}} grains play {{a crucial}} role in the formation of silicate dust agglomerates, rocky planetesimals, and terrestrial planets. The surface energy of silicate dust particles is the key to their adhesion and rolling forces in a theoretical model based on the contact mechanics. Here we revisit the cohesion of amorphous silica spheres by compiling available data on the surface energy for hydrophilic amorphous silica in various circumstances. It turned out that the surface energy for hydrophilic amorphous silica in a <b>vacuum</b> is a <b>factor</b> of 10 higher than previously assumed. Therefore, the previous theoretical models underestimated the critical velocity for the sticking of amorphous silica spheres, as well as the rolling friction forces between them. With the most plausible value of the surface energy for amorphous silica spheres, theoretical models based on the contact mechanics are in harmony with laboratory experiments. Consequently, we conclude that silicate grains with a radius of 0. 1 μm could grow to planetesimals via coagulation in a protoplanetary disk. We argue that the coagulation growth of silicate grains in a molecular cloud is advanced either by organic mantles rather than icy mantles or, if there are no mantles, by nanometer-sized grain radius.

It is found that, in the region of comparatively weak fields, (κ ≪ 1) field-induced corrections to the standard decay width of the W-boson in a vacuum are about a few percent. As the external-field-strength parameter is increased, the partial width with respect to W-boson decay through the channel in question, Γ(κ), first decreases, the absolute minimum of Γmin = 0. 926 · Γ(0) being reached at κ = 0. 6116. A further increase in the external-field strength leads to a monotonic growth of the decay width of the W-boson.

Diamond films with a surface roughness (R rms) ranging from 15 to 160 nm were produced by microwave-plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition. In humid air and in dry nitrogen, abrasion occurred when the diamond pin made grooves in the surfaces of diamond films, and thus the initial coefficients of friction increased with increasing initial surface roughness. The equilibrium coefficients of friction were independent of the initial surface roughness of the diamond films. In vacuum the friction for diamond films contacting a diamond pin arose primarily from adhesion between the sliding surfaces. In these cases, the initial and equilibrium coefficients of friction were independent of the initial surface roughness of the diamond films.

40|$|Ring {{instability}} is an impulsive deformation that progresses. At worst, instability is ring collapse. Buried pipes can invert only if {{the ring}} deflects and the soil slips at the same time. Instability of buried pipes is analyzed as a soil-structure interaction. Ring stiffness resists inversion; soil supports the ring to keep it close to circular shape. The present paper demonstrates the basic manners of ring instability for buried flexible pipes, ring deformation and buckling at yield stress. The analysis found that if the pipe is {{to be subjected to}} vacuum {{it is very important to}} limit ring deflection to 5 %. Because it increases the maximum vacuum to be larger than atmospheric pressure, therefore the pipe would not collapse. If the pipe is so flexible ring stiffness cannot be support any of the soil load. With 8 % ring deflection, the vacuum at collapse is,- 0. 55 bar with neglect term, Ed/rn 3, for ring stiffness.

It thus follows that identities are not formed, claimed, protected nor resisted in a <b>vacuum.</b> Contextual <b>factors,</b> which are influenced not only by historical processes and events, but also by current social, political and economic forces, are significant determinants of identity. In this study, one of South Africa’s former Model C schools {{was chosen as the}} research site in which to investigate the relationship between different, but related, contexts, the identities of learners, and the friendships that they formed. Three contexts were examined, namely the historical background of schooling in South Africa, the current school environment and the social context, which refers to relationships between teachers and learners. The teachers, in particular, were found to {{play a crucial role in}} shaping the learners’ identities. Their views, attitudes towards schooling and methods of teaching were informed largely by apartheid education, and most of their teaching experience was gained within this context. The general feeling among the teachers was that things had worked better in the past, under a system of segregated education. Although they did not reject or disregard the principle of equal education for all, they were not prepared or equipped beforehand to deal with the changes that the Schools Act introduced, and hence little effort was made on the part of the teachers to actively challenge racial stereotypes in a manner that underlies anti-racist education. De-racialised education did not only result in diversity in terms of ‘race’. It also changed the language and religious profile of the school. In its interrogation of these, and other, identity markers, this study assessed the ways in which the contexts, mentioned above, have impacted on the learners’ conceptions of themselves and others. It is clear that the immediate school context, which is ordered largely by teachers, provides little opportunity for seeking out shared experiences beyond obvious similarities, such as ‘race’, age, grade, sex, and language. However, despite the similarities among members of friendship groups, in terms of the more overt identity markers, learners display a tendency to group around other shared experiences, such as likes or dislikes, similar tastes or hobbies, and it is these experiences that, learners argue, have brought them together as friends.

Despite the fact that ARVs have been {{demonstrated}} to improve quality of life, reduce AIDS prevalence and AIDS deaths, many people in Nigeria still {{do not have access to}} ARV therapy. At the time this study was started, the ARV access rate was 16. 6 %. This Grounded Theory study examines the experiences of HIV positive people accessing ARVs in Abuja, Nigeria. 30 Patients living with HIV/AIDS were interviewed in an iterative manner. The results of the Grounded Theory analysis were triangulated with the documentary analysis of preliminary and secondary literature. As reported by the participants of the study, patients initially found it very difficult to access treatment. Stigma emerged as the main concern of the research participants. Although access to anti retroviral treatment has improved over the years, different forms of stigma still pose important barriers to access in this group of participants. The results of this research suggest that stigma occurs at individual, familial, community, organisational and national levels. The main concern of research participants was resolved mainly through the use of social connections. The contribution to knowledge is the development of the Social Connection Theory. 5 main stages that patients pass through when they attempt to access ARVs were identified in this study. During each of these stages, the patient may experience barriers through stigma or other forms of structural issues such as poverty. They may also move from one stage to another through social connectors who assist them to access ARVs. In the Social Connection Theory, it is argued that in African settings, social connectors play a vital role in influencing the way that patients access antiretroviral treatment. Social connectors are social acquaintances of the patient who help shape their health care seeking decisions. They play a vital role in supporting and linking HIV positive persons to where they can access ARVS. Social connection serves as a useful tool for empowering HIV patients to overcome different obstacles and access treatment. However, these processes do not occur in a structural <b>vacuum.</b> Structural <b>factors</b> such as religion, gender, politics and the economy were also found to shape the way stigma is experienced in Nigeria and how people access HIV treatment.

It was in these high quality factor regimes where much of the theory and understanding of the cantilever dynamics in dAFM originally developed. Prompted by the motivation to image a number of biological samples in pseudo-native environments, the oscillating dAFM probe was introduced to a liquid medium in the mid-nineties. The move to liquid environments brought with it theory and underlying assumptions that were established for operation in air and vacuum but frequently break down in liquids. Due to the presence of significant hydrodynamic loading, the quality factors of microcantilever probes in liquids are typically moderate to low. These low quality factor regimes introduce a new class of nonlinear phenomena in addition to new channels for compositional mapping of material properties. ^ This thesis focuses on aspects of the microcantilever dynamics unique to liquid environment dAFM. A high-fidelity model for the dynamics of microcantilevers interacting with substrates that is able to incorporate experimentally calibrated lumped parameters is developed. A study of the dynamics of microcantilevers with moderate quality factors based on a slow time description of the probe dynamics is presented. An investigation into the dynamics of microcantilevers with low quality factors through numerical simulations, experiments and continuation is provided.

40|$|Neonatal stroke {{refers to}} {{cerebrovascular}} events between 28 weeks of gestational age and 28 days postnatal and includes thromboembolic cerebral infarction {{and all kinds}} of intracranial haemorrhage. Neonatal stroke may contribute to severe neurological deficit, such as cerebral palsy and even death. International reports suggest the incidence to be approximately 1 / 4000 live births per year (1). There are several etiological hypothesises regarding risk factors, such as maternal, obstetrical and neonatal. Some maternal risk factors are thought to be of relevance, but conclusive results are yet to be revealed. In literature some authors hypothesisethat hypercoagulabilty of the maternofoetal circulation may predispose neonatal stroke as well as placental injuries (2). Regarding obstetrical <b>factors,</b> <b>vacuum</b> delivery is associated with intracranial haemorrhage in neonates (3). Duration of labour and mode of delivery play an important role as well (4; 5). Neonatal risk factors include embolic, thrombotic and ischemic events. Other possible causes are congenital heart disease (6; 7), intravascular catheters (8), coagulation disorders (9; 10), septicaemia and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (11), asphyxia (12) and polycytemia (13). However, in {{more than a third of}} cases, no causes are found (14). Materials and Methods The survey was carried out as a retrospective data collection of the cases of neonatal stroke at Rikshospitalet during the period of 1993 - 2003. Study parameters were chosen based on scientific publications and clinical consensus on maternal, intrauterine, obstetrical and neonatal variables. All maternal and neonatal charts were analyzed on the selected parameters. Ideally, the study should have been designed having a control group, but for many reasons this would require more time than accessible for the purpose of this project. To learn more about the pathological mechanisms, we read literature (14) as well as recent studies found by searching Medline, some of which are referred to in the abstract. Results The survey included 40 neonates and 40 mothers. Outcome data on cerebral events in neonates were 30 % cerebral infarction (12), and 70 % cerebral haemorrhage, with differences in haemorrhages located in brain parenchyma 40 % (16), sub-/epidural 20 % (8) and subarachnoidal 10 % (4). Seizures (35 %) and irritability (35 %) were the two major debut symptoms in neonates with infarction or cerebral haemorrhage. Only one child did not have any symptoms at all. Time to onset and diagnosis was approximately 20 hours. Many of the revised parameters, such as coagulation disorders, operative delivery and intravascular catheters showed similarities to published data. One German study of 91 neonates with ischemic events showed an OR of 6, 70 for at least one prothrombotic risk factor compared to the control group (9). Data from our survey, showed that four children with cerebral infarction that also were tested for coagulation disorders had at least one prothrombotic risk factor. Furthermore, our data showed a high number of operative deliveries (60 %), also being consistent with international literature (3; 5). Finally, 22, 5 % of the neonates in our survey had intravasal catheters for replacement therapy and monitoring. Indeed, this finding is interesting due to data in international studies (8; 13) indicating the combination of intravasal catheters and familial thrombophilia to play an important role in thromboembolism in children (15). Discussion The etiology of neonatal stroke has multiple causes. Knowledge on maternal, obstetric and neonatal risk factors is of major importance for providing prophylactic interventions as well as improving treatment both for obstetrical and neonatal care. We hope that this study may contribute to an increased awareness of neonatal stroke, thus apply a standardized evaluation of possible thrombotic disease in all cases of ischemic stroke in infants. Its causes and risk factors need further investigations. Reference List (1) Lynch JK, Hirtz DG, DeVeber G, Nelson KB.
