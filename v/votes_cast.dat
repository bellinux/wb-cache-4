Ford's 720,891 votes represented 65 {{percent of the total}} <b>votes</b> <b>cast</b> in the election, a record for a statewide race in Kentucky. Against Republican Jackson Andrews IV in 1986, Ford shattered that record, securing 74 percent of the <b>votes</b> <b>cast</b> and carrying all 120 Kentucky counties. State senator David L.
