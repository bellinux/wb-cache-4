50|$|In 1869 the First Transcontinental Railroad was {{completed}} using the more level route along the Humboldt River to the north—along {{much of the}} original California Trail route. Alongside the railroad a telegraph line was also constructed where {{it was easier to}} maintain and supply operators, relay stations, etc. The Central Route was now obsolete for the telegraph. After 1869 the stage and freight lines' traffic was now carried cheaper and faster on the railroad. The stage and <b>telegraph</b> <b>relay</b> stations were abandoned, and the soldiers at Fort Ruby were transferred north to Fort Halleck to protect the railroad.|$|R

5000|$|In 1890, Édouard Branly {{demonstrated}} what {{he later}} called the [...] "radio-conductor," [...] which Lodge in 1893 named the coherer, the first sensitive device for detecting radio waves. Shortly after the experiments of Hertz, Dr. Branly discovered that loose metal filings, {{which in a}} normal state have a high electrical resistance, lose this resistance {{in the presence of}} electric oscillations and become conductors of electricity. This Branly showed by placing metal filings in a glass box or tube and making them part of an ordinary electric circuit. According to the common explanation, when electric waves are set up in the neighborhood of this circuit, electromotive forces are generated in it which appear to make the filings move closer together, that is, to cohere, and thus their electrical resistance decreases accordingly, Sir Oliver Lodge termed this piece of apparatus a coherer. Hence the receiving instrument, which may be a <b>telegraph</b> <b>relay,</b> that normally would not indicate any sign of current from the small battery, can be operated when electric oscillations are set up. Prof. Branly further found that when the filings had once cohered, they retained their low resistance until shaken apart, for instance, by tapping on the tube.|$|R
5000|$|The beacon at {{the summit}} of One Tree Hill was erected to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of King George VI in 1935. It was {{subsequently}} used for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, her silver and golden jubilees and also at the Millennium. Beacons on the same site were used to give warning of invasion by the Spanish and later the French. The Hill was also the site of Watson's General <b>Telegraph,</b> a <b>relay</b> system established in 1841 linking London with shipping in the English Channel ...|$|R
50|$|Toll {{bridges and}} ferries were active at nearly all {{previously}} dangerous river crossings as the trail became not only safer but quicker. Stage coaches by changing teams at newly established stage stations about every ten to (16 km) twenty miles (32 km) and traveling day and night, {{could make a}} transit from the Missouri River to California in 25 to 28 days. After 1861, <b>telegraph</b> <b>relay</b> stations and their crews joined these stage stations along much of the route. Forts and army patrols helped protect these various stations from Indian attacks throughout the U.S. Civil War period and later. Regular wagon trains that only had one team per wagon and stopped at night cut their transit time from about 160 days in 1849 to 120 days in 1860. The tolls on the various bridges, ferries and toll roads typically averaged about $30.00 per wagon by 1860. All these toll bridges, roads and ferries shortened the journey west by about 40 days and made it much safer as bad parts of the trail were improved and dangerous river crossings were done now by ferries and toll bridges that cost money but were much safer and faster. Nearly all improvements were financed by tolls on the various roads, bridges and ferries.|$|R

40|$|The {{articles}} {{that make up}} this Sociological Inquiry feature emerged from the 1995 meetings of the American Sociological Association. The authors included in this issue were expressly solicited for a special session on “Technologically Generated Commu-nities. ” The authors were asked to individually provide their own perspectives on the intersection of technology, community, and social action. My essay attempts to crystallize several key changes that the new communication technologies demand of conceptual frames long embraced by sociologists. In particular, the pages that follow propose some necessary adjustments {{to the ways in}} which sociologists formulate and apply three key analytic concepts: social interaction, social bonding, and empirical experience. During my second year in graduate school, I had occasion to read Alfred Chandler’s fine book, The Visible Hand. The experience remains quite vivid in my mind, because The Visible Hand was the type of work that took its readers on a journey. In this case, the journey traversed those wondrous years at the end of the 1800 s, a time when U. S. shores were joined by cold metal train tracks and <b>vibrating</b> <b>telegraph</b> wires. Chandler told the story of a world faced, for better or worse, with profound change and profound possibilities. And as Chandler’s prose guided me through the era, I remember wondering if there could be a more exciting time to be alive than in those final decades of the nineteenth century. The past few years have silenced my query. Fiber optics, satellite transmis-sion, cellular radio technology, and microchips have entered the social playing field. Words like fax, internet, downloading, and virtual imaging have become a part of our everyday vocabulary. The arrival of these new communication tech-nologies makes it clear to me that “the more exciting time ” that I pondered as a graduate student is here and it is now...|$|R
50|$|The {{use of the}} Windmill Tower as {{a signal}} station from 1855 {{demonstrates}} an aspect of innovative technology to develop a system of communication linking semaphore and electric <b>telegraph</b> to <b>relay</b> shipping news to the settlement. The tower {{is also an important}} reflection of the management of timekeeping in the {{nineteenth and early twentieth centuries}} through the use of time balls and a time gun at the site from 1861 until 1930. The earliest research in Queensland into wireless radio and telephony was undertaken at the tower from 1922. Cutting edge television technology was also researched and demonstrated at the tower from 1924 until at least 1949.|$|R

50|$|The 13.716 m {{diameter}} satellite uplink dish {{was located}} on a perfectly flat concrete pad shielded by the Radar Dome. The dish had electro-mechanical actuators and was constantly tracking a NATO satellite positioned in geosynchronous orbit {{off the coast of}} Africa which broadcast a signal in the Super High Frequency. In this signal there could be 10,000 different channels of information which was received at SGT Folly Lake by a low-noise amplifier located on the dish. The amplified signal was then sent to a de-multiplexer which translated the signal into the appropriate channels and routed them to their correct destinations. Military NATO communications traffic was sent to the <b>Telegraph</b> Automated <b>Relay</b> Equipment (TARE) located at CFS Debert (until 1994), while civilian NATO communications traffic was sent through the local telecommunications company MT&T. The system allowed voice, video, faxes, teletype, and digital information to be sent.|$|R
2500|$|Vendetta {{was laid}} down at Williamstown Naval Dockyard, Melbourne on 4 July 1949. By 1950, {{it was already}} {{apparent}} that the Australian Darings would not be completed on time, as the Australian dockyards were experiencing difficulty in {{keeping up with the}} construction schedule. The destroyer was launched on 3 May 1954 by the widow of Hector Waller, who commanded the Scrap Iron Flotilla (including the original [...] ) during World War II. On 18 July 1958, on the first occasion Vendetta engaged her engines during builder's trials, the destroyer accidentally rammed the Alfred Dock caisson. The collision was caused when the sailor manning the engine <b>telegraph</b> incorrectly <b>relayed</b> an order of [...] "half astern" [...] as [...] "half ahead", then repeated the mistake when the order was repeated to compensate for the first error. Vendettas bow breached the caisson, and threatened to flood the dock with [...] inside. A controlled flooding kept the caisson from failing and prevented damage to Quickmatch or further damage to Vendetta, but the repairs to the destroyer's bow set completion back by three months.|$|R
25|$|The LCA's crew of four ratings {{included}} a Sternsheetsman, whose action station {{was at the}} stern to assist in lowering and raising the boat at the davits of the Landing Ship Infantry (LSI), a Bowman-gunner, whose action station was {{at the front of}} the boat to open and close the armoured doors, raise and lower the ramp, and operate the one or two Lewis guns in the armoured gun shelter opposite the steering position, a stoker-mechanic responsible for the engine compartment, and a Coxswain who sat in the armoured steering shelter forward on the starboard side. Though in control of the rudders, the coxswain did not have direct control of the engines and gave instructions to the stoker through voicepipe and <b>telegraph.</b> The craft <b>relayed</b> signals and orders to the other two craft in the group by signal flags in the earlier part of the war, but by 1944 many of the boats had been fitted with two-way radios.|$|R
60|$|Travelling on foot {{very early}} one morning due east from here about twenty miles, from Caleb Harriman's tavern in Hampstead toward Haverhill, when I reached the {{railroad}} in Plaistow, I heard at some distance a faint music {{in the air like}} an Aeolian harp, which I immediately suspected to proceed from the cord of the <b>telegraph</b> <b>vibrating</b> in the just awakening morning wind, and applying my ear to one of the posts I was convinced that it was so. It was the telegraph harp singing its message through the country, its message sent not by men, but by gods. Perchance, like the statue of Memnon, it resounds only in the morning, when the first rays of the sun fall on it. It was like the first lyre or shell heard on the sea-shore,--that vibrating cord high in the air over the shores of earth. So have all things their higher and their lower uses. I heard a fairer news than the journals ever print. It told of things worthy to hear, and worthy of the electric fluid to carry the news of, not of the price of cotton and flour, but it hinted at the price of the world itself and of things which are priceless, of absolute truth and beauty.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{identifiable}} {{communications and}} information distribution organization {{was called the}} NATO Integrated Communications Systems Central Operating Authority (NICS-COA) and was established to control, operate and maintain the NATO Communication systems of that time. The main elements of these systems were the Initial Voice Switched Network (IVSN), <b>Telegraph</b> Automated <b>Relay</b> Equipment (TARE), Status Control Alerting and Reporting System (SCARS), SATCOM systems and equipment and the ACE High Tropospheric Scatter trunk communication network. By the early 1990s due mainly {{to the arrival of}} new systems and new technology it became necessary to reorganize the Communication and Information systems support for NATO. This coincided with a major restructuring of the NATO Command {{to take advantage of the}} [...] "peace dividend" [...] after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In 1993 the NATO Communication and Information Systems Operating and Support Agency (NACOSA) was formed by the integration of functions previously undertaken by NICS-COA and some elements of the Communications and Information Systems Division of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE CISD). Over time it became apparent that there was still a need for establishments to streamline their operations to improve management and control and also to make a manpower saving of some 25% so NACOSA also took command of 4 subordinate elements. These were the Integrated System Support Centre (ISSC), Allied Command Europe Communications Security (ACE Comsec) (which later became INFOSEC Command NACOSA), The NATO Communication and Information Systems School (NCISS) at Latina, Italy and the Regional Signal Group SHAPE. In the following years, NACOSA developed into an organization with responsibilities for the operation and support of communication and information systems on both sides of the Atlantic and for all NATO Operational deployments.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} 1865 that the {{decision}} to build a town hall was made. The decision was made during a council meeting and also decided the construction of a boys school and part funding for a new church. Until then, the small municipal archives were kept by the mayor in office. At least some council meetings were held in some of the mayors' homes. When deciding to build a town hall it was stipulated that one room should be used exclusively by a library. Once built, two rooms houses the post office for letters and <b>telegraphs</b> (which were <b>relayed</b> to the semaphore on top of the Butte de Houlgate). A superb mahogany desk was donated to the commune in 1875 and was once used by the council as a meeting table; it is now the mayor's desk. In 1880 was created a permanent post office organisation and it moved to its own premises in 1895. The town hall was modified several times such as the building of a village hall. In June 1897, the municipal council voted to cover the walls of the village hall and to buy 150 chairs at a cost of 5.60₣ each. In 1980 the offices were extended, the council meeting room was extended, the vicarage was converted into a tourist office and its garden transformed into an open square.|$|R

On longer journeys they might relieve them to rest. They also manned any additional machine guns and operated the kedge anchor, if it was required. In mine fields and among anti-invasion obstacles and rocks seaman would sit on the bow or stern or move about the sides of his boat piloting or preventing it from hitting the obstacles.|$|R
25|$|The {{track laying}} was divided up into various parts. In {{advance of the}} track layers, {{surveyors}} consulting with engineers determined where the track would go. Workers then built and prepared the roadbed, dug or blasted through hills, filled in washes, built trestles, bridges or culverts across streams or valleys, made tunnels if needed, and laid the ties. The actual track-laying gang would then lay rails on the previously laid ties positioned on the roadbed, drive the spikes, and bolt the fishplate bars to each rail. At the same time, another gang would distribute telegraph poles and wire along the grade, while the cooks prepared dinner and the clerks busied themselves with accounts, records, using the <b>telegraph</b> line to <b>relay</b> requests for more materials and supplies or communicate with supervisors. Usually the workers lived in camps built near their work site. Supplies were ordered by the engineers and hauled by rail, possibly then to be loaded on wagons if they were needed ahead of the railhead. Camps were moved when the railhead moved a significant distance. Later, as the railroad started moving long distances every few days, some railroad cars had bunkhouses built in them that moved with the workers—the Union Pacific had used this technique since 1866. Almost all of the roadbed work {{had to be done}} manually, using shovels, picks, axes, two-wheeled dump carts, wheelbarrows, ropes, scrapers, etc., with initially only black powder available for blasting. Carts pulled by mules, and horses were about the only labor saving devices available then. Lumber and ties were usually provided by independent contractors who cut, hauled and sawed the timber as required.|$|R
