Exhaust heat recovery based on organic Rankine cycle (ORC) {{system has been}} considered as an effective approach for improving engine fuel economy. This article presents the investigation of water or air cooling method for an ORC exhaust heat recovery system on a heavy duty truck through simulations. The models of the truck engine and the ORC system were developed in GT-suite, and the integration system model {{was developed in the}} Simulink environment. The validity of the models was verified experimentally. The performance of the <b>vehicular</b> <b>engine</b> with ORC system using water or air cooling method was comparatively analyzed. The simulation results indicated that water cooling method is more suitable for the vehicular ORC system than air cooling method. The relation between benefit and penalty of the ORC system and cooling system was discussed. The operating condition of the cooling system was confirmed having significant effects on the combined system performance, especially the fan speed. The performance improvement of the engine with the use of ORC system was further evaluated under different engine operating conditions and ambient temperatures. Lower ambient temperature had positive impacts on the engine fuel economy. The mass flow rate of exhaust gas for heat recovery should be regulated for better performance under high ambient temperature...|$|E
40|$|Many {{events of}} {{interest}} to the security commnnity produce acoustic emissions that are, in principle, identifiable as to cause. Some obvious examples are gunshots, breaking glass, takeoffs and landings of small aircraft, <b>vehicular</b> <b>engine</b> noises, footsteps (high frequencies when on gravel, very low frequencies. when on soil), and voices (whispers to shouts). We are investigating wavelet-based methods to extract unique features of such events for classification and identification. We also discuss methods of classification and pattern recognition specifically tailored for acoustic signatures obtained by wavelet analysis. The paper is divided into three parts: completed work, work in progress, and future applications. The completed phase has led to the successful recognition of aircraft types on landing and takeoff. Both small aircraft (twin-engine turboprop) and large (commercial airliners) were included in the study. The project considered the design of a small, field-deployable, inexpensive device. The techniques developed during the aircraft identification phase were then adapted to a multispectral electromagnetic interference monitoring device now deployed in a nuclear power plant. This is a general-purpose wavelet analysis engine, spanning 14 octaves, and can be adapted for other specific tasks. Work in progress is focused on applying the methods previously developed to speaker identification. Some of the problems to be overcome include recognition of sounds as voice patterns and as distinct from possible background noises (e. g., music), as well as identification of the speaker from a short-duration voice sample. A generalization of the completed work and the work in progress is a device capable of classifying any number of acoustic events-particularly quasi-stationary events such as engine noises and voices and singular events such as gunshots and breaking glass. We will show examples of both kinds of events and discuss their recognition likelihood...|$|E
40|$|The {{recognised}} {{deficiencies in}} sustainable {{development and the}} extensive environmental deterioration and global warming concerns caused by anthropological CO 2 emissions are major issues facing the world today. Massive reduction in atmospheric CO 2 concentration, {{through the development of}} processes that utilize CO 2 or minimise CO 2 emissions, is critical to ensure environmental sustainability. One of the major contributors to anthropological CO 2 emission is the combustion of petroleum fuels in <b>vehicular</b> <b>engines</b> for transportation. Biofuel, as an alternative to petroleum transport fuels, has become a partial substitute for fossil fuel. The use of microalgae for biofuel production has gained enormous research interests in recent years, primarily due to the ability to photosynthetically convert CO 2 (a biology-inspired process engineering route) into potential biofuel biomass, as well as food, feed stocks, and high value biochemicals. In this review, the CO 2 fixation ability of microalgae in comparison to other plant species and genetic engineering methods of improving microalgae photosynthetic rate, have been discussed. Advances in bioprocess technologies for microalgal biomass creation and biodiesel production are also described and other important matters are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Huge {{amounts of}} low-grade heat energy are {{discharged}} {{to the environment}} by <b>vehicular</b> <b>engines.</b> Considering {{the large number of}} vehicles in the world, such waste energy has a great impact on our environment globally. The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), which uses an organic fluid with a low boiling point as the working medium, is considered to be the most promising technology to recover energy from low-grade waste heat. In this study, a dual-loop ORC is presented to simultaneously recover energy from both the exhaust gases and the coolant of a petrol engine. A high-temperature (HT) ORC loop is used to recover heat from the exhaust gases, while a low-temperature (LT) ORC loop is used to recover heat from the coolant and the condensation heat of the HT loop. Figure 1 shows the schematic of the dual-loop ORC. Differing from previous research, two more environmentally friendly working fluids are used, and the corresponding optimisation is conducted. First, the system structure and operating principle are described. Then, a mathematical model of the designed dual-loop ORC is established. Next, the performance of the dual-loop cycle is analysed over the entire engine operating region. Furthermore, the states of each point along the cycle and the heat load of each component are compared with the results of previous research. The results show that the dual-loop ORC can effectively recover the waste heat from the petrol engine, and that the effective thermal efficiency can be improved by about 20 ~ 24 %, 14 ~ 20 %, and 30 % in the high-speed, medium-speed, and low-speed operation regions, respectively. The designed dual-loop ORC can achieve a higher system efficiency than previous ORCs of this structure. Therefore, it is a good choice for waste heat recovery from vehicle engines...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{improvements}} in efficiency in many combustion processes including <b>vehicular</b> <b>engines,</b> the level of nitrogen dioxide in the typical urban environment continues to impact a human health and requires regular monitoring. This thesis describes {{the development of a}} novel remote-sensing instrument configured for the measurement of nitrogen dioxide and other trace species in an urban environment.;A novel concurrent multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy(CMAX-DOAS) system has been developed in this work based on scattered light spectroscopy. Data from the measurements has a temporal resolution of a minute or less and therefore the capability to spatially resolve different air masses as they traverse the instrument input optics. Such sampling capabilities are unique to a ground-based scattered-light DOAS system and are well suited to analysis of rapidly moving and distinct plumes in an urban environment.;The CMAX-DOAS instrument was built in 2002, and tested and validated during an intercomparison campaign in Norway in 2003. During 2004 concurrent measurements from multiple viewing geometries were made in Leicester (52. 6 oN, 1. 12 o W). Measured slant columns of nitrogen dioxide from the CMAX-DOAS instrument have errors calculated at less than 2 % for a single axis, and 4 to 6 % for analysis using a reference spectrum from another axis. These measurements agree well with in situ measurements and identify significant boundary layer concentrations (up to 80 microg m [...] 3) of nitrogen dioxide which clearly correlate with anthropogenic activity over diurnal, weekly and annual timescales.;Through concurrent measurement of different air masses, considerable information on individual plumes has been obtained, including estimates of source location, plume size provide on nitrogen dioxide emissions on an urban scale and are necessary to determine the link between urban activity, nitrogen dioxide emissions, air quality and ultimately human health...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} the {{potential}} of <b>vehicular</b> gas <b>engines</b> could not be realized because component materials served to limit the turbine operating temperature, thereby restricting fuel economy and initial cost. It was, therefore, not possible for the vehicular gas turbine to compete with more conventional engines. The emergence of low-cost, high-temperature ceramic components {{has the potential to}} reverse this situation. For example, the Allison GT 404 engine, operating with ceramic components at turbine inlet temperatures up to 2350 F to 2500 F, has the potential of a fuel economy which is better than that of current Diesel engines. The Allison AGT 100 engine operating with ceramic components offers the possibility of a 30 % improvement in fuel economy over 1985 spark ignition engines. The materials considered for an employment in the ceramic components include silicon carbide, silicon nitride, aluminum silicate, and lithium aluminum silicate...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} part of the world economy depends on stationary or <b>vehicular</b> Diesel <b>engines.</b> Such engines are fed mainly by fossil fuels, among these, the standard diesel. The growing interest in renewable energy sources makes the use of ethanol in these engines a real technological demand. From the existing concepts to meet this goal the Diesel-Ethanol in the Dual-Fuel mode has demand for published experimental data. Such concept brings a greater degree of freedom, but implications in technological challenges. It works through a PFI (Port Fuel Injection) system to prepare a pre-mixture of air and ethanol in the intake port which is compressed in the combustion chamber and ignited by pilot injection of diesel. In this work a single cylinder research engine with 100 % electronically controlled calibration was used. The engine control parameters were set to maximize diesel substitution rate by ethanol with a limited indicated efficiency loss. Comparisons were made among different working conditions. Initially, the flow structure in the combustion chamber was tested in both quiescent and high swirl modes. Compression ratios were adjusted at 3 different levels: 14 : 1, 16 : 1 and 17 : 1. Two injectors were tested, the first one with mass flow of 35 g/s and another of 45 g/s. Regarding pressure diesel injection, 4 levels were investigated namely 800, 1000, 1200 and 1400 bar. The experiments discussed in this work were able to achieve up to 65 % of diesel energy substituted by hydrated ethanol energy with an indicated efficiency of 49 %. In comparison with the diesel only running condition, the NOx emissions was improved by up to 60 %. But the HC, CO and aldehydes emissions had a penalty, showing a trade-off that shall be further investigated with a final design engine in the beginning of product development process...|$|R
40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAH) {{are a common}} pollutant created by natural (forest fires) or anthropogenic sources, such as incomplete combustion in <b>engines</b> (<b>vehicular</b> traffic) or incinerators. Many PAHs are known or suspected carcinogens and also have mutagenic properties and endocrine disrupting effects. Although most atmospheric PAHs are measured using high-volume sample collection on filters, a convenient way of monitoring these pollutants is through plant matrices, such as pine needles that act as passive samplers. The needles are covered with a lipid-rich cuticle that absorbs the pollutants. Evergreens are especially useful because they continue to accumulate pollutants during the winter. In order to use plants as monitors, a method to extract the PAHs must be used. Ultrasonication is a method that leaches the PAHs from the needles and into the solvent. The sonication agitates the pine needles and produces increased temperatures, which further abet {{the efficiency of the}} solvents 2 ̆ 7 extraction. This rapid method can be applied to batches of samples. The procedure is followed by a cleanup step.

40|$|Receptor-oriented source {{apportionment}} {{models are}} often used to identify sources of ambient air pollutants and to estimate source contributions to air pollutant concentrations. In this study, a PCA/APCS model {{was applied to the}} data on non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) measured from January to December 2001 at two sampling sites: Tsuen Wan (TW) and Central & Western (CW) Toxic Air Pollutants Monitoring Stations in Hong Kong. This multivariate method enables the identification of major air pollution sources along with the quantitative apportionment of each source to pollutant species. The PCA analysis identified four major pollution sources at TW site and five major sources at CW site. The extracted pollution sources included <b>vehicular</b> internal <b>engine</b> combustion with unburned fuel emissions, use of solvent particularly paints, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or natural gas leakage, and industrial, commercial and domestic sources such as solvents, decoration, fuel combustion, chemical factories and power plants. The results of APCS receptor model indicated that 39 % and 48 % of the total NMHCs mass concentrations measured at CW and TW were originated from vehicle emissions, respectively. 32 % and 36. 4 % of the total NMHCs were emitted from the use of solvent and 11 % and 19. 4 % were apportioned to the LPG or natural gas leakage, respectively. 5. 2 % and 9 % of the total NMHCs mass concentrations were attributed to other industrial, commercial and domestic sources, respectively. It was also found that vehicle emissions and LPG or natural gas leakage were the main sources of C 3 -C 5 alkanes and C 3 -C 5 alkenes while aromatics were predominantly released from paints. Comparison of source contributions to ambient NMHCs at the two sites indicated that the contribution of LPG or natural gas at CW site was almost twice that at TW site. High correlation coefficients (R 2 > 0. 8) between the measured and predicted values suggested that the PCA/APCS model was applicable for estimation of sources of NMHCs in ambient air.
