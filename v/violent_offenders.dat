5|$|Patton did {{not stop}} with the {{juvenile}} justice system, however. He encouraged passage of a bill that required that <b>violent</b> <b>offenders</b> serve at least 85percent of their sentences (up from the 50percent previously mandated), while requiring that judges consider home incarceration for first-time, non-violent offenders. The bill also allowed judges to sentence criminals to life without parole; previously, life without parole for 25years had been the harshest non-capital sentence. The bill passed the legislature in 1999.|$|E
5|$|As Attorney General, Dosanjh {{oversaw the}} {{resolution}} of the Gustafsen Lake Standoff involving the Secwepemc Nation, set up a database for registering <b>violent</b> <b>offenders,</b> established a hate crime division in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and lobbied for more police officers, probation officers, and judiciary. At the same time his office drew criticism for reducing legal aid and closing courthouses. As the Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism, Human Rights and Immigration he successfully lobbied for laws giving same-sex couples the equal rights and responsibilities for child support, custody and access. In early 1999, a special prosecutor under the RCMP opened an investigation into possible influence peddling by Premier Glen Clark concerning casino licensing. On March 4, after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) raided the Premier's house, they briefed Attorney General Dosanjh, whose office had to assist, and placed him under a gag order. The order was lifted on August 13, he informed Clark, and called a press conference, after which Clark resigned as Premier. Dosanjh's actions were variously criticized for not informing his party caucus and not going public sooner, and applauded for avoiding perceptions of conflict of interest despite his power to intervene.|$|E

40|$|In Texas, {{determinate}} sentencing allows extremely {{serious and}} violent delinquents {{one more chance}} to change their ways by releasing them to the streets instead of being transferred to prison. This research study examined the recidivism outcomes of 416 serious and <b>violent</b> juvenile <b>offenders</b> previously exposed to rehabilitative treatment in the renowned Capital and Serious <b>Violent</b> <b>Offender</b> Treatment Program provided by the Texas Youth Commission.

In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most <b>violent</b> <b>offenders</b> of modern times.|$|E
25|$|Under the Constitution of 1869, a Reconstruction {{document}} that centralized many governmental functions, no constables were elected in Texas from 1869 to 1872, though some were appointed by justices of the peace. Many of these appointees lacked experience in handling <b>violent</b> <b>offenders</b> {{and access to}} secure jail facilities, and had few deputies to call upon for assistance. They were {{no match for the}} poor, embittered, and heavily armed former soldiers from both sides who roamed the state, often turning to crime. As a result, the office of constable began to diminish in importance, and the better-equipped county sheriffs began to assume a leading role in law enforcement. Still, a number of prominent Texas peace officers of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries began their careers as constables or deputy constables, including Thomas R. Hickman, George A. Scarborough, and Jess Sweeten. In 1896, while serving as a United States deputy marshal, Scarborough shot and killed the controversial El Paso constable John Selman, who had himself gunned down the notorious John Wesley Hardin in 1895.|$|E
25|$|A large {{percentage}} of pimps in the United States are also documented gang members, which causes concerns for police agencies in jurisdictions where prostitution is a significant problem. Pimping rivals narcotic sales as {{a major source of}} funding for many gangs; this is particularly true with African-American gangs. Gangs need money to survive, and money equates to power and respect. While selling drugs may be lucrative for a gang, this activity often carries significant risk as stiff legal penalties and harsh mandatory minimum sentencing laws exist. However, with pimping, gang members still make money while the prostitutes themselves bear the majority of the risk. Pimping has several benefits to the gang that the pimp belongs to. These benefits include helping the gang recruit new members because the gang has women available for sex and the money brought in by prostitution allows gang members to buy cars, clothes and weapons, all of which help to recruit younger members into the gang by increasing the reputation of the gang in the local gang subculture. The presence of gangs (and weapons and drugs) is a virtual guarantee when prostitutes are present, which is why many law-enforcement agencies advocate taking an aggressive stance against prostitutes. Many vice units work to ascertain if the prostitute they have arrested has a pimp, and if so, they pressure them to provide information about their pimp and the gang involved. This information can then be used to go after the more serious and <b>violent</b> <b>offenders.</b>|$|E

Many have been ordered to undergo drug/alcohol testing, and are put on a random testing program. If the defendant continues to use drugs and/or alcohol, fails to get counseling, or otherwise violates his conditions of probation, they will be re-arrested by the Probation officer and returned to court for additional sentencing and/or other sanctions.|$|R

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{longitudinally}} investigated the criminal profiles of violent juvenile sex and <b>violent</b> juvenile non-sex <b>offenders.</b> To {{make up for}} this lack, this study used police records of juveniles to determine {{the nature of the}} criminal profiles of <b>violent</b> sex <b>offenders</b> (n = 226) and <b>violent</b> non-sex <b>offenders</b> (n = 4, 130).

2500|$|Parole is a {{controversial}} political {{topic in the}} United States. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, at least sixteen states have abolished parole entirely, and four more have abolished parole for certain <b>violent</b> <b>offenders.</b> During elections, politicians whose administrations parole any large number of prisoners (or, perhaps, one notorious criminal) are typically attacked by their opponents as being [...] "soft on crime". The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) stated in 2005 that about 45% of parolees completed their sentences successfully, while 38% were returned to prison, and 11% absconded. These statistics, the DOJ says, are relatively unchanged since 1995; even so, some states (including New York) have abolished parole altogether for violent felons, {{and the federal government}} abolished it in 1984 for all offenders convicted of a federal crime, whether violent or not. Despite the decline in jurisdictions with a functioning parole system, the average annual growth of parolees was an increase of about 1.5% per year between 1995 and 2002.|$|E
2500|$|Controversy has {{surrounded}} {{the privatization of}} prisons with the exposure of {{the genesis of the}} landmark Arizona SB 1070 law. This law was written by Arizona State Congressman Russell Pearce and the CCA {{at a meeting of the}} American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) in the Grand Hyatt in Washington, D.C. Both CCA and GEO Group, the two largest operators of private facilities, have been contributors to ALEC, which lobbies for policies that would increase incarceration, such as three-strike laws and [...] "truth-in-sentencing" [...] legislation. In face, in the early 1990s, when CCA was co-chair of ALEC, it co-sponsored (with the National Rifle Association) the so-called [...] "truth-in-sentencing" [...] and [...] "three-strikes-you're-out" [...] laws. Truth-in-sentencing called for all <b>violent</b> <b>offenders</b> to serve 85 percent of their sentences before being eligible for release; three strikes called for mandatory life imprisonment for a third felony conviction. Some prison officers unions in publicly run facilities such as California Correctional Peace Officers Association have, in the past, also supported measures such as three-strike laws. Such laws increased the prison population.|$|E
