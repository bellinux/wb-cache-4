40|$|AbstractThree {{methods for}} the {{determination}} of the large-strain behavior of ductile polymers are compared in both tension and compression. Each method relies on some (non-contact) measurement of the strain and some approximations in the calculation of stress. The strain measurement techniques include digital image correlation (DIC) and two techniques of video-based extensometry: marker tracking and area variation monitoring. Since the specimens are inevitably subject to structural plastic instabilities (necking in tension, barreling in compression) the strain and stress states are no longer uniform in the gauge section after the peak load. Under such circumstances, it is demonstrated that the three experimental methods can lead to significant differences. It is inferred from the comparative analysis that the method based on <b>vertical</b> <b>marker</b> tracking is not reliable. Validated by DIC, video-based area variation is shown to be a simple alternative way to obtain an excellent estimate of the intrinsic true stress–strain behavior of the polymer...|$|E
40|$|Coral reefs around Guam {{are faced}} with {{multiple}} threats including soil erosion and sedimentation. In several of Guam’s southern watersheds, infertile soil upland has significantly deterred the growth of erosion-mitigating vegetation. Additionally, sediments that wash down to sea reduce the ability of coral reefs to thrive. The need to ameliorate the ecosystem decline related to erosion and sedimentation is particularly patent and pertinent in Pago Watershed. To inform restoration efforts, this research will identify the efficiency of GeoJute® barriers {{as a method of}} erosion control. Factoring cost, labor, and effectiveness in containing sediment, GeoJute® barriers are hypothesized as a practical and sustainable method. A representative area measuring 100 -by- 50 ft. will be used to conduct the research including a control area at the center. To the left of the control, 1 GeoJute® barrier measuring 20 ft. long will be implemented at every 10 -feet <b>vertical</b> <b>marker</b> going up slope. Sediment buildup at each barrier will be used to gauge erosion control. The cost and labor needed to initiate and maintain the treatment will be calculated to evaluate the barrier’s practicality as a restoration method. GeoJute® barriers should be effective in trapping sediments that wash down slope. The labor in starting and maintaining the 40 -by- 50 ft. treatment area should only require a workforce of 1 person ranging from 30 - 240 minutes of labor and monitoring a da...|$|E

The time difference (t) between triggering time and signal arrival at the nth receiver is the spread-time between transmitter and receiver along a fixed distance equal to the l = (n− 1) ×  0.1  m (the separation) between neighboring sensors. The wave velocity is then defined by simply dividing: V = l/t. Examples of field records are presented in Fig.  6 d, e. The transmitting transducer in Fig.  6 d is no. 1 marked on records by an asterisk (see ultrasonic probe in Fig.  6 c for explanation).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{systematically}} assess the effect of Oxford Foot Model (OFM) marker misplacement on hindfoot relative to tibia, and forefoot relative to hindfoot kinematic calculations during the stance phase of gait. Marker trajectories were recorded with an 8 -camera motion analysis system (Vicon Motion Systems Ltd., UK) and ground reaction forces were recorded from three force platforms (AMTI, USA). A custom built marker cluster consisting of 4 markers in a square arrangement (diagonal distance 2 cm) was used to assess the effect of marker misplacement in the superior, inferior, anterior and posterior direction for the sustentaculum tali (STL), the proximal 1 st metatarsal (P 1 M), distal 5 th metatarsal (D 5 M), proximal 5 th metatarsal (P 5 M) and lateral calcaneus (LCA) markers. In addition manual movement of the heel complex 1 cm superiorly, inferiorly, medially and laterally, and also an alignment error of 10 ° inversion and 10 ° eversion was assessed. Clinically meaningful effects of marker misplacement were determined using a threshold indicating the minimal clinically important difference. Misplacement of the heel-wand complex had the most pronounced effect on mean kinematic profiles during the stance phase across all degrees-of-freedom with respect to hindfoot–tibia and forefoot–hindfoot angles. <b>Vertical</b> <b>marker</b> misplacement of the D 5 M and P 5 M markers affected the sagittal plane, {{and to a lesser extent}} frontal plane, forefoot–hindfoot kinematics.

A total of 281 MG positive field isolates out of 571 MG samples were detected with the primer targeted pMGA gene {{and a total of}} 188 MG positive field isolates out of 571 MG samples were detected with the primer targeted pvpA gene. Similar and identical banding pattern among MG isolates obtained from progenies samples however, there was a variable on the banding pattern among MG isolates obtained from commercial chickens using the agarose gel electrophoresis. The sequencing analysis results of MG based on selected genes targeted specific sequences were obtained. The genetic diversity of the pMGA and pvpA genes of MG field isolates detected in progenies and commercial chickens were investigated. The gene size variation patterns of the pMGA and pvpA genes among MG field isolates shared identical variations with the pathogenic reference and vaccine strains that is an insertion bp fragments by using the pMGA gene primer set and a deletion bp fragments by using the pvpA gene primer set. However, the gene size variation patterns are quite different from the variation pattern of the less pathogenic vaccine strain that can’t be transmitted vertically. The polymorphism pattern of the primer for pMGA gene might be considered as a pathogenic <b>vertical</b> <b>marker</b> and the polymorphisms patterns of the two primers sets for both pMGA and pvpA genes might be useful for determining the two genetic potential pathogenic marker for MG infection that can differentiate between the highly and the less pathogenic MG isolates...|$|E

In this paper, we demonstrate {{how to do the}} same with objects arranged in a three-dimensional structure without modifying the table. We present lumino, a system of building blocks. In addition to a marker, each block contains a glass fiber bundle. The bundle optically guides the light reflected off markers in the higher levels down to the table surface, where the table’s built-in camera reads it. While guiding marker images down, the bundle optically scales and rearranges them. It thereby fits the images of an entire <b>vertical</b> arrangement of <b>markers</b> into the horizontal space usually occupied by a single 2 D marker. We present six classes of blocks and matching marker designs, each of which is optimized for different requirements. We show three demo applications.

40|$|Group {{synchronisation}} in choir {{performance was}} studied using motion capture. The choir consisted of South-African experts and Finnish novices. 4 + 4 participants’ movements were recorded during {{a performance of}} a traditional song and choreography. The aim {{of the study was}} to: 1) describe possible differences in movement implementation between the two groups; 2) investigate synchronicity between all participants and within and between each of the two groups; 3) visualise the dynamics of interpersonal influence. Preliminary results indicate that simple indicators such as cumulative distance and position as a function of time reveal differences in implementation of choreography between the groups. Movements were very synchronous, but cross-correlations of the <b>vertical</b> velocities of <b>markers</b> revealed a subtle phase difference between individuals and shows that the expert group was more coherent than the novices, as was expected. This could be due to having more attentional resources to spend on coordination, as the musical and movement material is more familiar to the experts than the novices. Finally, the interpersonal interaction was visualised using windowed cross-correlation. This suggests that the temporal relationship of movements reflects the participants’ mutual adaptation to each other’s subtle timing perturbations, and that this adaptation is a dynamic process...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} a neglected area of castles studies - the spiral stair. It studies the origins, evolution, placing, structure, role, significance {{and meaning of}} spiral stairs in medieval stone castles between 1066 and 1500, so covering the rise, zenith and decline of the castle in England and Wales. Although focussed upon England and Wales, it has a wider geographical spread across Ireland, Scotland, Europe, the Middle East and Japan with particular regard to castles and on even wider when searching for {{the origins of the}} spiral stair, encompassing the whole globe. The date range was also extended, both much earlier than 1066 when searching for these origins and very selectively beyond 1500 when exploring how the spiral was used in the later medieval and early modern periods. It is proposed that the first known spiral stair was employed in Trajan's Column in the first century AD, that it was then used more selectively in secular and later ecclesiastical buildings during the first millennium AD and that, from the eleventh century onwards, the spiral stair became a common feature of the medieval castle. From the emergence of the spiral stair in Rome, this thesis places its principal use in European elite and ecclesiastical structures. Focusing on the castle, this thesis argues that it was employed as a <b>vertical</b> boundary <b>marker</b> to signal and control movement between two different types of spaces, from a more public to a more private space and from a general or less restricted space to a space which was more restricted, often elite domestic quarters. This use of the spiral is seen in and is traced through different types of English and Welsh castles, from stronghold to enclosure and on to the so-called sham or cult castles of the late medieval period. The thesis also looks at the spiral in a range of medieval castles and other defensive buildings outside England and Wales and finds that, in the main, spirals were employed in the same way. It also explores the presence and role of the spiral within other medieval buildings, both in England and Wales and further afield, and argues that, although there are some exceptions and variations, in the main spiral stairs played the same role in those buildings. This thesis interprets the spiral stair within the medieval castle as a key component of the landscape of lordship and argues that the interpretation of this elite landscape, hitherto focused on the environs and outward appearance of the castle, should not stop at the castle gate but should move inside. Accordingly, this thesis takes a step to bring the interior of the castle deeper into research and discussion; to explore individual items and features within the castle; and to consider their placing, access and meaning within the medieval world.

40|$|Part 6 of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) {{describes}} {{several types}} of channelizing devices {{that can be used}} to warn road users and guide them through work zones; these devices include cones, tubular <b>markers,</b> <b>vertical</b> panels, drums, barricades, and temporary raised islands. On higher speed/volume roadways, drums and/or vertical panels have been popular choices in many states, due to their formidable appearance and the enhanced visibility they provide when compared to standard cones. However, due to their larger size, drums also require more effort and storage space to transport, deploy and retrieve. Recent editions of the MUTCD have introduced new devices for channelizing; specifically of interest for this study is a taller (> 36 inches) but thinner cone. While this new device does not offer a comparable target value to that of drums, the new devices are significantly larger than standard cones and they offer improved stability as well. In addition, these devices are more easily deployed and stored than drums and they cost less. Further, for applications previously using both drums and tall cones, the use of tall cones only provides the ability for delivery and setup by a single vehicle. An investigation of the effectiveness of the new channelizing devices provides a reference for states to use in selecting appropriate traffic control for high speed, high volume applications, especially for short term or limited duration exposures. This study includes a synthesis of common practices by state DOTs, as well as daytime and nighttime field observations of driver reactions using video detection equipment. The results of this study are promising for the day and night performance of the new tall cones, comparing favorably to the performance of drums when used for channelizing in tapers. The evaluation showed no statistical difference in merge distance and location, shy distance, or operating speed in either daytime or nighttime conditions. The study should provide a valuable resource for state DOTs to utilize in selecting the most effective channelizing device for use on high speed/high volume roadways where timely merging by drivers is critical to safety and mobility...|$|R
40|$|The late Albian Mowry Shale of Wyoming and Montana, and {{the time}} {{equivalent}} Big River Formation of Saskatchewan, were studied to {{determine the cause of}} anoxia within the Mowry Seaway and {{the presence or absence of}} small scale (fourth order) cyclicity. The Mowry Shale is an important source rock, characterized by high total organic carbon content (TOC) (0. 5 - 5. 0 %), abundant fish debris, numerous bentonites, and prolific radiolarians. Minimal bioturbation at distal sites from Wyoming to Canada indicates that the preservational quality of bottom water with respect to organic matter was high throughout the basinal area of the seaway. TOC values were highest at the southern end however, coincident with a high in radiolarian abundance. This correlation suggests an added input of planktonic organic carbon at the southern end of the seaway, due to higher levels of paleoproductivity. Therefore, anoxia within the Mowry Seaway may have resulted from two processes, stagnation in Canada, and elevated planktonic fertility in Wyoming and Montana. Seasonal upwelling has been predicted along the SE margin of the Albian seaway from independent climate models. Burial rates of Si and P in the Mowry Shale indicate paleoproductivity levels comparable to lower values reported from modern coastal upwelling zones. This fertility could have been supported entirely by nutrients derived from a (depleted) seawater source, even with limited renewal rates. Six locations in N. Wyoming were tied into an onshore - offshore resistivity well log transect. TOC, phosphorous content, and lithologic profiles from each section could then be correlated using numbered bentonite <b>markers.</b> <b>Vertical</b> sedimentation trends were divisible into three intervals. Within the context of sequence stratigraphy, these units may be interpreted as the Transgressive Systems Tract (decreasing sand, increasing TOC), the Condensed Interval (minimum sand, peak TOC), and the Highstand Systems Tract (increasing sand, decreasing TOC). Higher order cyclicity is present in the Mowry Shale, as 1 - 10 m coarsening-up cycles near the western margin, and 5 - 30 m fertility cycles in the basin. Correlation of marginal to basinal cycles indicate that during shallowing-up, decreases in TOC on the shelf coincide with minor increases in TOC in the basin...|$|R
40|$|Reinforcement of soil {{enables a}} soil slope or wall to be {{retained}} at angles steeper than the soil material’s angle of repose. Geosynthetic Reinforced Soil (GRS) systems enable shortened construction time, lower cost, increased seismic performance and potentially improve aesthetic benefits over their conventional retaining wall counterparts such as gravity and cantilever type retaining walls. Experience in previous earthquakes such as Northridge (1994), Kobe (1995), and Ji-Ji (1999) indicate good performance of reinforced soil retaining walls under high seismic loads. However, this good performance {{is not necessarily}} due to advanced understanding of their behaviour, rather this highlights the inherent stability of reinforced soil against high seismic loads and conservatism in static design practices. This is an experimental study {{on a series of}} seven reduced-scale GRS model walls with FHR facing under seismic excitation conducted using a shake-table. The models were 900 mm high, reinforced by five layers of stiff Microgrid reinforcement, and were founded on a rigid foundation. The soil deposit backfill was constructed of dry dense Albany sand, compacted by vibration (average Dr = 90 %). The influence of the L/H ratio and wall inclination on seismic performance was investigated by varying these important design parameters throughout the testing programme. The L/H ratio ranged from 0. 6 – 0. 9, and the walls were primarily vertical except for one test inclined at 70 o to the horizontal. During testing, facing displacements and accelerations within the backfill were recorded at varying levels of shaking intensity. Mechanisms of deformation, in particular, were of interest in this study. Global and local deformations within the backfill were investigated using two methods. The first utilised coloured horizontal and <b>vertical</b> sand <b>markers</b> placed within the backfill. The second utilised high-speed camera imaging for subsequent analysis using Geotechnical Particle Image Velocimetry (GeoPIV) software. GeoPIV enabled shear strains to be identified within the soil at far smaller strain levels than that rendered visible by eye using the coloured sand markers. The complementary methods allowed the complete spatial and temporal development of deformation within the backfill to be visualised. Failure was predominantly by overturning, with some small sliding component. All models displayed a characteristic bi-linear displacement-acceleration curve, with the existence of a critical acceleration, below which deformations were minor, and above which ultimate failure occurs. During failure, the rate of sliding increased significantly. An increase in the L/H ratio from 0. 6 to 0. 9 caused the displacement-acceleration curve to be shallower, and hence the wall to deform less at low levels of acceleration. Accelerations at failure also increased, from 0. 5 g to 0. 7 g, respectively. A similar trend of increased seismic performance was observed for the wall inclined at 70 o to the horizontal, when compared to the other vertical walls. Overturning was accompanied by the progressive development of multiple inclined shear surfaces from the wall crest {{to the back of the}} reinforced soil block. Failure of the models occurred when an inclined failure surface developed from the lowest layer of reinforcement to the wall crest. Deformations largely confirmed the two-wedge failure mechanism proposed by Horii et al. (2004). For all tests, the reinforced soil block was observed to demonstrate non-rigid behaviour, with simple shearing along horizontal planes as well as strain localisations at the reinforcement or within the back of the reinforced soil block. This observation is contrary to design, which assumes the reinforced soil block to behave rigidly...|$|R
