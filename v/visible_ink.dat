25|$|As of July 2015, the Philippine Passport {{is printed}} in Asian Productivity Organization or APO Productions under the Presidential Communications Group. On August 15, 2016, the new {{generation}} e-passport was released by the Department of Foreign Affairs with advanced security features such as the upgraded microchip to capture the personal data of the applicant, invisible ultraviolet (UV) fluorescent ink and thread, and elaborate design when subject to UV light. Security inks were also used to print the passports to prevent forgery. These inks include intaglio, which are <b>visible</b> <b>inks</b> that have a distinct ridged feel and ultraviolet ink that appears when exposed to infrared lights. Other security features include watermarks, perforated passport numbering, embedded security fibers, among others. Aside from making the new e-passport tamper-proof, each leaf of the 44-page document depicts Philippine artifacts, cultural icons, historic places, renowned tourist destinations, and even lyrics of the national anthem.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Documents {{written on}} both sides on {{translucent}} paper make <b>visible</b> the <b>ink</b> from one side on the other. This artefact is called “back-to-front interference”, “bleeding ” or “showthrough”. The direct binarization of documents with such interference yields unreadable documents. The literature presents several algorithms for suitably removing such artefact. This paper presents a quantitative method to assess algorithms to remove back-to-front interference...|$|R

50|$|Inking of {{the stamp}} occurs through the {{application}} of a thiol solution either by immersion or coating the stamp with a Q-tip. The highly hydrophobic PDMS material allows the ink to be diffused into the bulk of the stamp, which means the thiols reside not only on the surface, but also in the bulk of the stamp material. This diffusion into the bulk creates an ink reservoir for multiple prints. The stamp is let dry until no liquid is <b>visible</b> and an <b>ink</b> reservoir is created.|$|R

50|$|Handwriting is {{historically}} considered the widest taught motor skill. It {{is also one}} of the first, and often the only motor skill that children will learn at elementary school. It takes years of practice and maturing before a person has mastered the adult handwriting skill. Handwriting is not considered only as a movement that leaves a <b>visible</b> trace of <b>ink</b> on paper (product) but it can also be considered as a movement (process). Understanding of the handwriting product will not be complete until the handwriting process is understood. Therefore, handwriting movement has been researched since measurement techniques became available.|$|R
50|$|As a Lorraine inhabitant, Jean Rouppert {{had been}} {{influenced}} by German art and Lorraine art from the 16th and 17th century (Dürer, Callot) which enhanced his stroke with cogency and accuracy. The influence of Gallé and {{to a greater extent}} the Arts and Crafts Movement, the Art Nouveau and japonisme appear in his works. This influence becomes <b>visible</b> through his <b>ink</b> drawings as much as in his water colours, his gouache works or his sculptures. Jean Rouppert put his art on display during the 1930s, 1940s and the 1950s. He exhibited his works in museums and galleries, including the “Salon de la Société lyonnaise des Beaux-Arts” and the “Salon des Amis des Arts à Roanne”.|$|R

40|$|Direct {{chemical}} analysis and molecular imaging of questioned documents in a non/minimal-destructive manner {{is important in}} forensic science. Here, we demonstrate that solvent-free gold-nanoparticle-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry is a sensitive and minimal destructive method for direct detection and imaging of <b>ink</b> and <b>visible</b> and/or fluorescent dyes printed on banknotes or written on questioned documents. Argon ion sputtering of a gold foil allows homogeneous coating of {{a thin layer of}} gold nanoparticles on banknotes and checks in a dry state without delocalizing spatial distributions of the analytes. Upon N 2 laser irradiation of the gold nanoparticle-coated banknotes or checks, abundant ions are desorbed and detected. Recording the spatial distributions of the ions can reveal the molecular images of <b>visible</b> and fluorescent <b>ink</b> printed on banknotes and determine the printing order of different ink which may be useful in differentiating real banknotes from fakes. The method can also be applied to identify forged parts in questioned documents, such as number/writing alteration on a check, by tracing different writing patterns that come from different pens. © 2010 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Capsular polysaccharides of C. liquefaciens were incorporated onto the cell surface of acapsular C. neoformans mutant cells. Polysaccharide composition determinations in combination with confocal microscopy revealed that C. liquefaciens capsule consisted of mannose, xylose, glucose, glucuronic acid, galactose and N-acetylglucosamine. Physical chemical analysis of the C. liquefaciens polysaccharides in comparison with C. neoformans samples revealed significant differences in viscosity, elastic properties and macromolecular structure parameters of polysaccharide solutions such as rigidity, effective diameter, zeta potential and molecular mass, which nevertheless appeared to be characteristics of linear polysaccharides that also comprise capsular polysaccharide of C. neoformans. The environmental yeast, however, showed enhanced susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of the environmental phagocytes, suggesting that the C. liquefaciens capsular components are insufficient in protecting yeast cells against killing by amoeba. These results suggest that capsular structures in pathogenic Cryptococcus species and environmental species share similar features, but also manifest significant difference that could influence their potential to virulence...|$|R

40|$|The YMoO 4 nanophosphors codoped with Ho 3 +/Yb 3 +/Li+ ions {{synthesized}} by {{the chemical}} coprecipitation method have been structurally characterized by using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) techniques. The TEM {{bright field imaging}} shows that the developed nanophosphors are crystalline in nature with particle size similar to 45 nm. The upconversion (UC) emission spectra upon excitation at 980 nm of the nanophosphors at low pump power (= 900 mW) an intense broad band ranging from 400 - 900 nm along with a UV band has been observed. The enhancement of about similar to 104 times corresponding to the green band in the Ho 3 +-Yb 3 +-Li+ codoped nanophosphors {{compared to that of}} the Ho 3 + singly doped nanophosphors has been observed. This enhancement is caused by the energy transfer from the Yb 3 + to Ho 3 + ions and modified the local crystal field developed around the rare earth ions. A higher value of the slope (i. e., n similar to 6. 38) for broad band emission within the 944 mW- 1200 mW pump power region in the Ho 3 +-Yb 3 +-Li+ codoped nanophosphors is found to be due to the involvement of the photon avalanche population process but it is not related to the black body radiation. The intense peak at similar to 564 nm and similar to 648 nm for the broad band emission is attributed to the charge transfer luminescence of codoped nanophosphors, which is related to the oxygen ion present in the MoO 4 group and Yb 3 + ion. The observations described in this paper may be of significant interest for developing the <b>visible</b> upconverters, security <b>ink,</b> and novel devices for displays in the low and high pump power region.

40|$|Manufactured products, such as furniture, {{laminate}} flooring, {{and large}} signs, are very labour intensive, time-consuming, and costly to produce as they require multiple coating and cutting operations {{on a series}} of independent machines, which can each introduce manufacturing errors between the tools and the work piece. By combining the processes of printing and milling, printing integrated manufacturing has the potential to eliminate some of these steps, significantly reduce errors, and preserve resources. Inkjet printing is an ideal method for both image transfer and coating operations due to its non-contact method of directly depositing various types of fluid onto a substrate. With improved positioning accuracy and droplet miniaturisation, inkjet printing could even be used for future applications like the mass-production of MEMS devices, which are traditionally fabricated with a highly complex process involving photolithography. 	This thesis presents the integration of a Xaar 126 inkjet printing system with an existing industrial flatbed CNC router to develop a combined printing and cutting system. This integration required modification to the overall system through mechanical, electrical, and software means to the existing 3 -axis CNC milling system. A secondary z-axis was installed onto the router gantry for positioning of the printheads relative to the substrate, which required development of a separate homing routine to consistently position the printheads to a specified location. Based on the identified frequency response of the machine, a loop-shaping controller was designed for improved y-axis positioning, {{which is one of the}} main contributions to droplet placement accuracy. This resulted in a continuous motion tracking accuracy within ± 20. 2 µm at 250 mm/sec along a print pass (measured by 1. 22 nm resolution linear encoder), which is significantly better than the industrial benchmark of ± 100 µm. 	Extensive image processing and calibration methods were utilised on various substrate preparations of paper, wood, and coatings, to demonstrate the capability of the printing system and quantify the quality of print resolution. Calibration results tested on high-gloss Hewlett-Packard paper showed that the swath angle could be aligned within ± 1 °. Also, bidirectional printing could be used to reduce print time by at least 15 % in multi-colour printing with comparable droplet placement accuracy to unidirectional printing. The inkjet system was successfully used to print custom designs on paper and, to a certain extent, on medium density fibreboard at a feed rate of 250 mm/sec. It was difficult to achieve satisfactory image results on wood, as the wood or paint grain was <b>visible</b> through the <b>ink.</b> Thus, without a white pre-coat, the printed image would appear significantly darker than the original image, even after adjusting the image in a graphics editor. For better quality results, it is recommended that greyscale printheads be implemented for greater resolution and a UV system should be investigated for more versatility in printing on different substrates such as glass, metals, plastics, and ceramics...|$|R
