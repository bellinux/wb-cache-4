50|$|<b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> are rugged {{and have}} long lasting accuracy, are coolant proof, are not {{affected}} by magnetic fields, and are largely shock proof. They may have both centimeter and inch scales. However, <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> require good eyesight or a magnifying glass to read and {{can be difficult to}} read from a distance or from awkward angles. It is relatively easy to misread the last digit. In production environments, reading <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> all day long is error-prone and is annoying to the workers.|$|E

50|$|The vernier scales {{may include}} metric {{measurements}} {{on the lower}} part of the scale and inch measurements on the upper, or vice versa, in countries that use inches. <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> commonly used in industry provide a precision to 0.01 mm (10 micrometres), or one thousandth of an inch. They are available in sizes that can measure up to 72 in.|$|E
50|$|In machine design, some {{components}} are particularly sensitive to angular errors. For example, if {{the shaft of}} a lathe is angled slightly, the part will have errors in diameter far down the part. <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> are not free from abbe error, while screw gauges are free from abbe error. Abbe error {{is the product of}} the abbe offset and the sine of angular error in the system.|$|E
50|$|A vernier {{throttle}} is a throttle {{often used}} in aircraft. It uses a cable and a screw mechanism to provide the operator precise control over an engine's operation. The concept is similar in use to <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> which have a primary scale for gross measurements, and a secondary scale for fine measurements. Like many other inventions that bear his name, the Vernier throttle {{is based on the}} work of mathematician Pierre Vernier.|$|E

40|$|Simple tool used in {{conjunction}} with conventional <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> to measure outside diameter of round post or tube to which lateral access limited. Chuck-like jaws closed gently onto end of post or tube. Tool slipped off without changing jaw setting, and distance between jaws measured with <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper.</b> In original application, posts are liquid-oxygen-injector posts surrounded by forest of many such posts on rocket engine. Used in other applications in which desire to measure diameters despite limited lateral access, provided there is longitudinal access...|$|R

50|$|It {{was also}} endowed with many {{teaching}} and experimental instruments, such as desks, chairs, microscopes, <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers,</b> and multitesters from the Official Development Assistance Japan. This was the sequence to the Japan's 3rd Program of Secondary Education Equipment for Minority Areas in the People's Republic of China (第三次少数民族地区中学教育器材装备计划) launched by ODA Japan in 1999; the No.1 Senior High School {{was one of}} those to have been endowed, while the equipment was put into service in 2000.|$|E
50|$|A vernier {{thruster}} is {{a rocket}} engine {{used on a}} spacecraft for fine adjustments to the attitude or velocity of a spacecraft. Depending {{on the design of}} a craft's maneuvering and stability systems it may simply be a smaller thruster next to the main propulsion motors, or it may complement larger attitude control motors, or may {{be a part of the}} reaction control system.The name is derived from <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> (named after Pierre Vernier) which have a primary scale for gross measurements, and a secondary scale for fine measurements.|$|E
50|$|Zero {{error is}} defined as such a {{condition}} when a measuring instrument registers a reading when {{there should not be}} any reading. In case of <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> it occurs when a zero on main scale does not coincide with a zero on vernier scale. Rather the zero error may be of two types i.e. when the scale is towards numbers greater than zero it is positive else negative.The method to use a vernier scale or caliper with zero error is to use the formula: actual reading = main scale + vernier scale − (zero error).Zero error may arise due to knocks that cause the calibration at the 0.00 mm when the jaws are perfectly closed or just touching each other.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{evaluate}} the applicability and suitability of the different methods, including weight loss, <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper,</b> drainage method, 3 D scanning and XCT methods in the measurement of geometric parameters and amount of corrosion of a steel bar. A single 400 mm long and 14. 11 mm diameter steel bar was measured first as non-corroded specimen before an accelerated corrosion of its 300 mm long middle part took place. This {{was followed by the}} measurement and evaluation of the geometrical parameters of the same bar specimen within its 300 mm long corroded part and 30 mm non-corroded part at its right end using different methods. The results show that the geometrical parameters of a corroded bar measured using 3 D scanning and XCT methods well matched each other and much more precise than those using weight loss, <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> and drainage methods. 3 D scanning is the most suitable method to measure the geometrical parameter of a corroded bar. <b>Vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> is the best option for measuring the geometrical parameter of a non-corroded bar...|$|R
30|$|Subsequently, anthropometric {{measurements}} were {{taken with a}} digital <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper,</b> followed by frontal and profile facial photographs taken in a natural head position. A sliding digital <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> {{was used to measure}} predetermined anthropometric facial parameters directly on each subject. These {{measurements were}} performed in agreement with well-established methods previously described [13]. The frontal and profile photograph of each participant was taken utilizing a standardized method with the participant in natural head position, the same camera to participant distance, the same background, and comparable illumination by means of a digital camera, a Canon 70 D (with macro lens 100 and Macro Ring Flash II).|$|R
30|$|We {{evaluate}} the antibacterial activities of samples by detecting the inhibition zone. The antibacterial efficiency on S. aureus is obtained {{by measuring the}} diameter of the bacteriostasis circles, which is measured by a <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> while testing three bacteriostasis circles repeatedly.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of thou {{as a base}} unit for machining work required the dissemination of <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> and screw micrometers throughout the trade, as the unit {{is too small to}} be measured with practical repeatability using rules alone. (Most rule markings were far too wide to mark a single mil, and even if such dividing is accomplished, it is illegible to the naked eye, being discernible but not useful for measuring.) During the following half century, such measuring instruments went from expensive rarities to widespread, everyday use among machinists. Bringing more metrology into machining increased the separation of concerns to make possible, for example, designing an assembly to the point of an engineering drawing, then having the mating parts made at different firms who did not have any contact with (or even awareness of) each other—yet still knowing with certainty that their products would have the desired fit.|$|E
40|$|To enable {{investigation}} of palatal changes in infants who are prematurely born, {{it is necessary}} to first establish a reliable method of measurement of these tiny edentulous palates. This study compared the Olivetti-Inspector machine, <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers,</b> and stereophotogrammetry for this purpose. Measurements were taken of 12 palatal casts of four infants at prescribed time intervals during the neonatal period. In each of the three methods, measurements were recorded as variables generated in the X and Z axes of the Cartesian scale in relation to three specified points along the Y axis. The results revealed that all methods were comparable, but the <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> differed significantly from the other two methods in height measurements, (p < 0. 001). It was also found that both the Olivetti-Inspector machine and the <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> consistently underestimated the width, compared with Olivetti-Inspector machine, (p < 0. 05). Stereophotogrammetry was found to be the most consistent method of measuring the configuration of preterm infant palates...|$|E
30|$|N.B: To {{facilitate}} accurate measurement, the caliper {{scale was}} aligned {{parallel to the}} long axis of the foot. The long axis of the foot runs through the second digit. Foot breadth was measured perpendicular to the long axis with <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> as a straight distance between the metatarsal fibulare and metatarsal tibiale, with the foot in a fully stretched position.|$|E
50|$|The modern <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper,</b> {{reading to}} {{thousandths}} of an inch, {{was invented by}} American Joseph R. Brown in 1851. It was the first practical tool for exact measurements that could be sold at a price within the reach of ordinary machinists.|$|R

5000|$|Also {{existing}} colloquially but not {{in formal}} usage is referring to a <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> as a [...] "vernier" [...] or a [...] "pair of verniers". In imprecise colloquial usage, some speakers extend this even to dial calipers, although they involve no vernier scale.|$|R
30|$|The SH, BD and CW {{data for}} each progeny at 4  years of age were {{measured}} using diameter tape and <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers.</b> The {{location of the}} BD measurements was on the trunk, 20  cm above the ground. The CW of each seedling was calculated using the mean value of canopy diameter measured along two different orientations: from south to north and from east to west.|$|E
30|$|Studies {{comparing}} {{the accuracy of}} implant impression techniques with methods such as micrometers, <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers,</b> strain gauges, or measuring microscopes could merely carry out two-dimensional measurements [5, 34 – 36]. However, when the measurements are two dimensional only, relevant information is lost. Therefore, CMM {{was used as the}} measuring device in this study because it made three-dimensional evaluation of any distortion possible. When points from different implant casts have a common reference within a coordinate system, the 3 D orientation of analogs can be recorded [37].|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} first case of leucism in the spadenose shark, Scoliodon laticaudus from India. This report {{is based on the}} study of a single {{specimen}} of S. laticaudus caught by a commercial trawler off Mangalore coast. Photographs were taken and measurements recorded using <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers.</b> Partial reduction in pigmentation and no other morphometric differences were seen between the specimen studied and other normal spadenose sharks. Conclusion of leucism in the specimen was done based on the partial lack of integumentary pigments and normal eye colour...|$|E
5000|$|The {{method to}} use a <b>vernier</b> scale or <b>caliper</b> with zero error {{is to use the}} formula [...] "actual reading = main scale + vernier scale − (zero error)". Zero error may arise due to knocks that cause the {{calibration}} at the 0.00 mm when the jaws are perfectly closed or just touching each other. Positive zero error refers to the fact that when the jaws of the <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> are just closed, the reading is a positive reading away from the actual reading of 0.00 mm. If the reading is 0.10 mm, the zero error is referred to as +0.10 mm. Negative zero error refers to the fact that when the jaws of the <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> are just closed, the reading is a negative reading away from the actual reading of 0.00 mm. If the reading is −0.08 mm, the zero error is referred to as −0.08 mm.|$|R
50|$|Positive {{zero error}} {{refers to the}} fact that when the jaws of the <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> are just closed, the reading is a {{positive}} reading away from the actual reading of 0.00mm. If the reading is 0.10mm, the zero error is referred to as +0.10 mm.|$|R
50|$|A caliper must be {{properly}} applied against the part {{in order to}} take the desired measurement. For example, when measuring the thickness of a plate a <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> must be held at right angles to the piece. Some practice may be needed to measure round or irregular objects correctly.|$|R
30|$|Routinely cultured {{hepatoma}} {{cells were}} collected, washed with PBS, and resuspended in PBS to 2 [*]×[*] 106 cells/mL. A total of 0.2  mL of the prepared cell suspension (4 [*]×[*] 105 HepG 2 cells) was {{injected into the}} right armpit of each nude mouse and tumor growth observed every other day. Typically, subcutaneous foreleg tumors became visible after 5 to 7  days. At this time, tumor sizes were measured with <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers,</b> and the long diameter, short diameter, and height of each tumor were recorded. Treatment started when tumor volumes reached approximately 0.5  cm 3. The mice were randomly divided into the following groups (n[*]=[*] 15): normal control animals (neither photosensitizer nor light treatment), and nanoscale photosensitizer and conventional photosensitizer treatment groups. Each animal in the treatment groups received an intraperitoneal injection of 10  mg photosensitizer per kilogram. Four hours later, animals were irradiated with a 63 -nm laser (500  mW, 10  min). The subcutaneous xenograft tumors were ellipsoid in shape; thus, tumor volumes were calculated using the equation for ellipsoid volume: V[*]=[*]a[*]×[*]b[*]×[*]c[*]×[*]π[*]×[*] 4 / 3 (a: long diameter of the tumor; b: short diameter of the tumor; c: tumor height). After treatment, tumor sizes were measured every other day with <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers.</b> Tumor dimensions were determined by averaging three repeated measurements. Lag phases in tumor growth before and after treatment and final mouse survival times were recorded.|$|E
30|$|Emergence {{percent was}} {{calculated}} by dividing the number of seedlings that emerged {{by the total number}} of seeds planted. For destructive measures, three transplants were harvested at random from each experimental unit plug tray, with the exception of tray edges. Transplant height was measured from the root collar to apical meristem. Leaves were collected, cleaned with tissue paper, and then measured using an LI-COR LI- 3000 leaf area meter (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Transplants were uprooted when the media were moist. Roots were washed and dried with tissue paper before weighing to determine the fresh weight of transplants. Stem diameter was measured below the cotyledon node with <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers.</b>|$|E
30|$|In the laboratory, {{samples of}} L. fortunei were rinsed with running {{water in a}} sieve (containing a 60 -μm wire gauze). Individuals of greater than 1  mm, which {{included}} juveniles and both prereproductive and reproductive adults, were separated with forceps or by hand from sediment particles and then counted, and the shell length was measured (the maximum anterior-posterior axis) with digital <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers.</b> Sediment particles retained in the sieve were observed, and recruits (of less than 1  mm), i.e., early juveniles, were counted under a binocular magnifying glass. These recruits were ready to attach to a hard substrate {{as evidenced by the}} well-developed foot and the presence of a shell (Cataldo and Boltovskoy 2000).|$|E
30|$|The {{quality of}} {{appearance}} {{is determined by}} grain length, width, width/length ratio, size and shape, and translucency of endosperm (Juliano and Villareal., 1993; Unnevehr et al., 2006). Several appearance-related traits were also used to test whether they have any relationship with BRR. The length and width of 10 fully formed grains from each DH line were measured using a <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper.</b> The length/width ratio of the grains was calculated with dividing grain width by grain length. It reflects the shape of grains. Ten randomly selected unbroken brown rice grains of each DH line were lined up to measure grain length, width, and length/width ratio {{in the same way}} as described above. The thickness of 10 grains and 10 brown rice grains in each line were also measured using a <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper.</b>|$|R
30|$|The whole-leaf {{thickness}} {{expressed by}} the average of thirty leaves thickness taken from the third considered section after {{the division of the}} aerial part of every individual in four equal sections extending from the ground level to tip of the top leaf.

30|$|At {{least five}} plants of each Artemisia species were {{carefully}} {{removed from the}} soil. The roots were washed carefully. The lengths of the main root, lateral root and the diameter {{at the base of}} the main root, were determined using a <b>Vernier</b> <b>caliper.</b> Lateral root number was counted, and root volume was determined through the water replacement method.|$|R
