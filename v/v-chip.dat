5|$|The PTC {{has been}} {{frequently}} criticized for hypocrisy, slanted reporting and only criticizing shows that {{are aimed at}} adults. Critics of the PTC have alleged that it supports increased governmental censorship of television by lobbying the FCC for indecency enforcement for certain television shows and inaccurately reporting on the <b>V-Chip</b> {{in order to further}} their agenda.|$|E
5|$|La Resistance {{infiltrate}} the USO show, but The Mole is discovered {{and killed by}} guard dogs. The remaining boys attempt to warn their mothers {{about what will happen}} if Terrance and Phillip are killed, but they are laughed at, and Mr. Garrison activates the electric chair. A Canadian force attacks the base and a battle ensues between the two armies. In the confusion, the boys are able to free Terrance and Phillip, though Cartman's <b>V-chip</b> begins to malfunction. The mothers, seeing the destruction their movement has incited, decide to give up and look for their children.|$|E
5|$|Stan {{leads the}} kids to Terrance and Phillip, who have been cornered by the US army. La Resistance forms a human shield while Kyle tries to persuade the army and his mother against killing the two. Sheila refuses and shoots Terrance and Phillip, which results in Satan, his minions, and Saddam attacking Earth. As a result, Sheila regrets everything. Saddam tries to usurp Satan's authority, but is sent back to Hell and killed, thanks to Cartman's {{malfunctioning}} <b>V-Chip</b> and Kenny's encouragement. Satan then grants Kenny a wish; Kenny asks for everything to return to how {{it was before the}} war, even though it means he will {{have to go back to}} Hell. He takes off his hood to say goodbye to his friends, but instead of returning to Hell, Kenny ascends to Heaven due to his act of sacrifice. Everything returns to normal in South Park.|$|E

25|$|HBO {{has long}} {{maintained}} a policy {{not to run}} R-rated films on its primary channel between 6:00a.m. and 8:00p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time; this policy (which may have once stemmed from HBO's availability on analog cable tiers, while its multiplex channels generally required a digital cable subscription or at least scrambling) remains in place , despite {{the existence of the}} <b>V-chip</b> and other premium services having incorporated R-rated films onto their daytime schedules starting in the mid-1980s. The policy was also applied to all TV-MA rated programs after the TV Parental Guidelines were implemented on January 1, 1997; however the main HBO channel began airing a limited amount of TV-MA rated original series, movies and documentaries that contain some strong profanity and violence, but are largely devoid of nudity, and graphic violent or sexual content on weekends before 8:00p.m. Eastern in 2010. However, HBO does occasionally rebroadcast R-rated films as early as 6:00p.m. Eastern Time as part of its Sunday rebroadcast of the prior Saturday's movie premiere telecast, depending on the length of the film and the scheduling of any HBO original series that air after it.|$|E
500|$|Since the <b>V-Chip</b> was {{established}} {{in conjunction with the}} TV Parental Guidelines ratings system, PTC has frequently accused the guidelines of having inaccuracy and low standards. In 1997, PTC was twice as likely to rate a show with the toughest rating classification, [...] "red light" [...] in the PTC's case, and [...] "TV-14" [...] in the Guidelines. Bill Berkowitz quoted PTC president Bozell as stating, based on PTC research, that [...] "the current ratings system and <b>V-chip</b> are failures." [...] In response to a <b>V-Chip</b> advertising campaign in the summer of 2006, Bozell proposed instead that cable companies either apply FCC-style broadcast television standards or offer choice in ordering channels. Television Watch considers PTC's reporting on the <b>V-chip</b> inaccurate and ideologically charged.|$|E

During a discussion about <b>v-chips,</b> Connecticut senator Joseph Lieberman told series co-creator Marta Kauffman that he was appalled by the scene where Monica and Rachel fight over the last condom and turned off his television. Kauffman dismissed Lieberman's comments because he misunderstood the scene; the characters were advocating safe sex by agreeing that whoever did not have the condom could not have sex.|$|R

After overhearing Cartman leading the children in a song degrading her, Sheila has Dr. Vosknocker implant a <b>V-Chip.</b> The device gives Cartman an electric shock every time he swears. Back in Hell, Satan declares that if the blood of the two innocent Canadians touches American soil, he will invade Earth. Later, Kenny's ghost visits Cartman to warn him of the consequences of executing Terrance and Phillip. After failing to convince their parents, the boys decide to take matters into their own hands.

500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on DVD in the US [...] on November 23, 1999, with a VHS release initially for rental services only, such as Blockbuster. A traditional retail VHS release followed on May 16, 2000. The DVD contained three theatrical trailers for special features, which many criticized as being typical of [...] "bare-bones" [...] DVD releases. There is also a NTSC laserdisc version that {{was released on}} January 18, 2000; copies are extremely rare. The film was re-released on Blu-ray on June 30, 2009 in celebration of its decade-long anniversary. The film's 1080p AVC encode (at [...] ) {{was taken from the}} original film source as well with random audio sync issues, despite the fact the film was animated entirely digitally. IGN's Scott Lowe explained, [...] "Although clearly aged, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut looks great and is free of the washed out, compressed imperfections of previous standard definition releases of the film." [...] However, Michael Zupan of DVDTalk notes that an automatic digital scratch removal process may have inadvertently removed some intentional lines from the picture, notably during Cartman's first scene with the <b>V-chip.</b> The disc contained a full-length audio commentary from Parker and Stone, as well as other crew members though most of them had no recollection of making the film due to heavy scheduling.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} a [...] "certified fresh" [...] {{approval}} rating of 81% {{with an average}} rating of 7/10 based on 94 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes; the site's consensus states: [...] "Its jokes are profoundly bold and rude but incredibly funny at the same time." [...] It also has a 73 out of 100 rating based on 31 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews", at Metacritic. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film [...] "outrageously profane" [...] and [...] "wildly funny", writing that [...] "While censorship is the filmmakers' main target [...] favorite monster is the Motion Picture Association of America, self-appointed guardians of the nation's chastity. It's all in good dirty fun and in service of their pro-tolerance theme." [...] Stephen Holden of The New York Times heavily praised the film, regarding the film's [...] "self-justifying moral" [...] as [...] "about mass entertainment, censorship and freedom of speech." [...] He also praised Cartman's subjection to the <b>V-chip,</b> which he called [...] "the movie's sharpest satirical twist, reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange". Entertainment Weekly graded the film an A− and praised the film's message in a post-Columbine society, as well as Parker and Shaiman's musical numbers, which [...] "brilliantly parody / honor the conventions of Broadway show tunes and, especially, the Disney-formula ditties that began with Alan Menken and Howard Ashman." [...] The Washington Post Michael O'Sullivan neutrally regarded the offensive nature of the film, commenting [...] "Yes, the lampooning is more broad than incisive, but under the bludgeoning of this blunt instrument very few sacred cows are left standing." [...] In a review that was later quoted on the film's original home video cover, Richard Corliss from Time warned viewers [...] "You may laugh yourself sick – as sick as this ruthlessly funny movie is." [...] Corliss would later name the film his fifth favorite animated film of all time. The film had {{its fair share of}} critical detractors, without noting the conservative family groups offended by the film's humor. Jack Matthews of the Daily News suggested the film's running time made Parker and Stone [...] "run out of ideas", while Roger Ebert stated that the [...] "vicious social satire" [...] of the film both [...] "offended" [...] and [...] "amazed" [...] him. Ebert called the film [...] "the year's most slashing political commentary", but also said, [...] "It is too long and runs out of steam, but it serves as a signpost for our troubled times. Just for the information it contains about the way we live now, thoughtful and concerned people should see it. After all, everyone else will." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Parents Television Council, {{which has}} {{frequently}} criticized MTV, has also frequently criticized The Real World for its overtly sexual content. In addition, that organization contends that because MTV routinely reruns Real World episodes {{with a simple}} [...] "TV-14" [...] rating without the [...] "L" [...] (language) descriptor, parents cannot block out the show with a <b>V-Chip,</b> although countering reports claim that the <b>V-Chip</b> does not totally rely on content descriptors added to the general ratings to work. An episode of [...] that was broadcast in January 2004 came under intense criticism from both the PTC and American Family Association for its sexual content.|$|E
2500|$|Responding to {{two columns}} that Bozell wrote in early 2005, San Francisco Chronicle {{columnist}} Neva Chonin claimed that Bozell wanted to forbid offensive television programs {{not only from}} his views, but [...] "from all our living rooms, choice and taste be damned." [...] Television Watch, an organization promoting parental responsibility for children's television viewing over increased government regulation of television, used a short clip of Bozell saying that the <b>V-Chip</b> is ineffective at blocking inappropriate television programs in a promotional video released in July 2005 intended to claim that special-interest groups like Bozell's own Parents Television Council are using such propaganda to justify increased government control of the public airwaves.|$|E
50|$|Three {{experimental}} groups (High Information, Low Information, Control Group) {{were used to}} determine how crucial pre-emptive training and informational sessions on the <b>V-chip</b> were to their actual use. The first group was given a new TV, equipped with <b>V-chip</b> technology, and detailed information about the <b>V-chip.</b> The second group was also given a new TV equipped with <b>V-chip</b> technology but no special training on the <b>V-chip.</b> The control group was not given a new TV or special training but was followed over the same time period to observe their <b>V-chip</b> use.|$|E
50|$|From 1999-2001, a {{research}} {{study was conducted}} at the University of Pennsylvania Annenberg Public Policy Center to observe {{the use of the}} <b>V-chip</b> in family households. The study was conducted on a total of 150 families with {{children between the ages of}} 7 and 10 who had <b>V-chip</b> television sets in their homes. Over the course of a year, families' use of the <b>V-chip</b> technology was observed to draw conclusions about the overall use of the <b>V-chip</b> in family environments.|$|E
50|$|Many {{families}} {{either had}} no idea that their television possessed a <b>V-chip</b> or gave up after struggling to program it. Even families who were given extensive information on the <b>V-chip</b> still opted to not use the technology. Overall, this study suggests that there are an insufficient number of households that implement the <b>V-chip</b> technology.|$|E
50|$|A March 2007 Zogby poll indicated, {{among other}} things, that 88% of {{respondents}} {{did not use}} a <b>V-chip</b> or cable box parental controls in the previous week, leading the Parents Television Council to call thetelevision industry's <b>V-chip</b> education campaign a failure.

50|$|As {{stated in}} an article in the Washington Times from March 1998, the <b>V-chip</b> was envisioned to be inexpensive. The cost to install the <b>V-chip</b> into {{televisions}} that are not already equipped with it is between $5-10. In addition, every television set with screens of 13″ or larger sold after the year 2000 is required to have a <b>V-chip</b> pre-installed. Therefore, some say the cost is insignificant when purchasing a television.|$|E
5000|$|Many parents' {{groups are}} in favor of {{monitoring}} children's viewing habits, mostly for the purpose of building family values. [...] "America's families will be now the ultimate judges of new ratings system's effectiveness,"http://www.educationpolicy.org/briefs/refrmnws-Jul97B.htmsaid Lois Joan White, Parent-Teacher Association president, in 1997 in support of <b>V-chip</b> technology. The <b>V-chip</b> is also supported by other websites like FamilySafeMedia.com, http://www.familysafemedia.com/v-chip.html which presents technologies like the Weemote and TVGuardian as alternatives to the <b>V-chip.</b> http://www.familysafemedia.com/about_us.html ...|$|E
5000|$|According to a 2003 study, parents' {{low level}} of <b>V-chip</b> use is {{explained}} in part by their unawareness of the device and the [...] "multi-step and often confusing process" [...] necessary to use it. Only 27% of all parents in the study group could {{figure out how to}} program the <b>V-chip,</b> and many parents [...] "who might otherwise have used the <b>V-Chip</b> were frustrated by an inability to get it to work properly." ...|$|E

5000|$|While {{a lot of}} controversies {{have been}} sparked by the <b>V-chip,</b> what sets it apart from other issues is that the <b>V-chip</b> imposes no {{government}} constraints on television programming itself; {{it is up to}} an individual family's discretion to choose which programs to block. When Congressman Ed Markey, chair of the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, introduced the first <b>V-chip</b> legislation, he told the press that parents [...] "will be given the power to send a message directly to the industry.

50|$|<b>V-chip</b> is {{a generic}} term for {{technology}} used in television set receivers in Canada, Brazil and the United States, {{which allows the}} blocking of programs based on their ratings category. It is intended for use by parents to manage their children's television viewing. Televisions manufactured for the United States market since 1999 and all units as of January 2000 are required to have the <b>V-chip</b> technology. The idea for blocking programs in this way was patented by Brett West and John P. Gardner in 1994 and tested in Canada. Since then many devices using <b>V-chip</b> technology have been produced.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the amount}} that has been spent on educating parents on use of the <b>V-chip,</b> {{there is still a}} low {{proportion}} of users. Of parents who have access to the <b>V-chip,</b> just 20% actually use it. As reported in 2007, 52% of parents who had access to the <b>V-chip</b> were unaware of its existence, and 27% of parents who knew of the V-chip's existence opted not to try it. Tim Winters, the Executive director for the now-defunct Parents Television Council stated, [...] "What I see is a solution that's flawed at every level.

5000|$|In 1993, Keith Spicer {{met with}} top American {{executives}} and disclosed {{information about the}} <b>V-Chip</b> Technology. [...] "Tim Collings' creation holds promise {{in the future of}} the television industry, and the more exposure achieved, the more nations are able to benefit." [...] Discussions took place about the increasing amount of violence on TV and the importance of monitoring and blocking shows. This sparked interest, but no steps were taken for implementation. In 1994 the technology was presented at a Violence on TV conference in France and later again at a conference in Belgium. This is where Al Gore first became familiarized with the concept of the <b>V-Chip</b> and the exposure helped him to advise Bill Clinton which led to the decision to pass the Telecommunications Act of 1996. [...] Once the <b>V-Chip</b> gained the ability to block multiple shows at the same time interest in the technology expanded significantly.
