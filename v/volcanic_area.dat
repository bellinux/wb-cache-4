5|$|The geology of the Lassen <b>volcanic</b> <b>area</b> {{presents}} {{a record of}} sedimentation and volcanic activity {{in the area in}} and around Lassen Volcanic National Park in Northern California, U.S. The park is located in the southernmost part of the Cascade Mountain Range in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Pacific Oceanic tectonic plates have plunged below the North American Plate in this part of North America for hundreds of millions of years. Heat from these subducting plates has fed scores of volcanoes in California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia over at least the past 30 million years (see Geology of the Pacific Northwest) and is also responsible for activities in the Lassen <b>volcanic</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later, but not {{precisely}} dated, eruptions from the Lassen <b>volcanic</b> <b>area</b> have formed over 30 smaller steep-sided, mound-shaped accumulations of volcanic rock, called lava domes. Crescent Crater, which {{at first glance}} appears as a parasite on Lassen's northeast flank, has been more heavily glaciated and thus is older. Other dacite domes which rose on Tehama's flanks are Bumpass Mountain, Helen Ridge, Eagle Peak, Vulcan's Castle and Reading Peak. An upper limit of 10,000years has been set for the domes next to Lost Creek (north domes). All of these domes must have risen with great rapidity.|$|E
5|$|Somewhat later, andesitic lavas {{poured out}} {{from what is}} now Reading Peak and mainly flowed {{to the south and}} east, {{reaching}} the head of Warner Valley. By this time, the park's eastern portion had been transformed into a relatively flat plain. The activity was followed by an eruption of the Eastern basalts from volcanoes east of the park. These thick flows have subsequently eroded to produce rugged hills that limit the park on the east. Taken together, these various flows built the lava plateau that the Lassen <b>volcanic</b> <b>area</b> is located on.|$|E

50|$|Andosols (from Japanese an meaning {{dark and}} do soil, a synonym of kuroboku) are soils found in <b>volcanic</b> <b>areas</b> formed in <b>volcanic</b> tephra. In some cases can andosols {{also be found}} outside active <b>volcanic</b> <b>areas.</b> Andosols cover an {{estimated}} 1-2% of earth's ice-free land surface. Andosols {{are closely related to}} other types of soils such as vitrosols, vitrandosols, vitrons and Pumice Soils that are used in different soil classification systems.|$|R
5|$|Hot springs {{are closely}} {{associated}} with fumaroles, which are vents in an active <b>volcanic</b> <b>area</b> releasing steam and hot gases, such as sulfur dioxide. In general, the water is rotating groundwater that comes into contact with rocks heated by magma and finds openings to the surface. The formation of the springs depends both on the rocks the water has passed through and the profusion of volcanic discharges mixed with the groundwater. Iron oxide, iron sulfides and other substances usually colour pools of boiling mud brilliant yellow, red, brown or green. Hot springs comprising significantly softened silica may deposit it to form siliceous sinter, whereas those comprising softened calcium carbonate deposit spongy-looking calcareous rock called tufa. Overflow of the springs can build masses, spires or stepped terraces of calcareous sinter or tufa.|$|E
25|$|Warm springs are {{sometimes}} {{the result of}} hot and cold springs mixing. They may occur within a <b>volcanic</b> <b>area</b> or outside of one. One example of a non-volcanic warm spring is Warm Springs, Georgia (frequented for its therapeutic effects by paraplegic U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who built the Little White House there).|$|E
25|$|The longest {{road tunnel}} was the Cocceius Tunnel near Naples, Italy, which {{connected}} Cumae with {{the base of}} the Roman fleet, Portus Julius. The 1000m long tunnel was part of an extensive underground network which facilitated troop movements between the various Roman facilities in the <b>volcanic</b> <b>area.</b> Built by the architect Cocceius Auctus, it featured paved access roads and well-built mouthes. Other road tunnels include the Crypta Neapolitana to Pozzuoli (750m long, 3–4m wide and 3–5m high), and the similarly sized Grotta di Seiano.|$|E

40|$|Stress {{inversion}} of seismological datasets became an essential tool {{to retrieve the}} stress field of active tectonics and <b>volcanic</b> <b>areas.</b> In particular, in <b>volcanic</b> <b>areas,</b> {{it is able to}} put constrains on volcano-tectonics and in general in {{a better understanding of the}} volcano dynamics. During the last decades, a wide range of stress inversion techniques has been proposed, some of them specifically conceived to manage seismological datasets. A modern technique of stress inversion, the BRTM, has been applied to seismological datasets available at three different regions of active volcanism: Mt. Somma-Vesuvius (197 Fault Plane Solutions, FPSs), Campi Flegrei (217 FPSs) and Long Valley Caldera (38, 000 FPSs). The key role of stress inversion techniques in the analysis of the volcano dynamics has been critically discussed. A particular emphasis was devoted to performances of the BRTM applied to <b>volcanic</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
25|$|The Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province {{is part of}} an area of {{intensive}} earthquake and volcanic activity around the Pacific Ocean called the Pacific Ring of Fire. However, the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is commonly interpreted {{to be part of a}} gap in the Pacific Ring of Fire between the Cascade Volcanic Arc further south and the Aleutian Arc further north. But the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is recognized to include over 100independent volcanoes that have been active in the past 1.8million years. At least three of them have erupted in the past 360 years, making it the most active <b>volcanic</b> <b>area</b> in Canada. Nevertheless, the dispersed population within the volcanic zone has witnessed few eruptions due to remoteness and the infrequent volcanic activity.|$|E
25|$|The Neogene {{experienced}} {{periods of}} volcanic activity. While the northern {{areas of the}} Altiplano Cundiboyacense were affected by the near-surface volcanism of Paipa and Iza, both in Boyacá, the <b>volcanic</b> <b>area</b> closer to the Eastern Hills was located around present-day Guatavita. The volcanism here has been analysed to have been post-Andean uplift. The Plio–Pleistocene period was marked {{by the presence of}} a fluvio-lacustrine depositional environment (Lake Humboldt) on the Bogotá savanna, sourced by rivers running off the Eastern Hills. The sedimentological record revealed various stages of infill, where the smaller-scale setting was determined by the paleo-water level and climate conditions. During the coldest periods, Lake Humboldt was surrounded by páramo ecosystems, with plant growth around the lake reducing lake shore erosion. The Latest Pleistocene was characterised by a period of cooling with a minor glacier present in the highest part of the central Eastern Hills.Moraines in this area have been dated to 18,000 until 15,500 years BP, in the late Last Glacial Maximum.|$|E

Because these eruptions are relatively nonviolent, they rarely cause human fatalities.|$|E
500|$|In {{the past}} 50,000years, {{at least seven}} major episodes of dacitic {{volcanism}} produced lava domes and pyroclastic deposits in the Lassen <b>volcanic</b> <b>area,</b> and another five episodes produced basaltic and andesitic (silica content between basalt and dacite) lava flows. Eruptions have occurred at sites including Lassen Peak, Chaos Crags, and Sunflower Flat (explosive dacite eruptions followed by dome growth) and Tumble Buttes, Hat Mountain, and Prospect Peak (basalt eruptions). [...] In addition, about 30 smaller volcanoes erupted basaltic lavas in the larger region surrounding the Lassen volcanic center.|$|E

500|$|The {{composition}} of the molten rock (magma) that feeds volcanism in the Lassen <b>volcanic</b> <b>area</b> ranges widely in its content of silica or the higher the silica content, the greater {{the ability of the}} magma to trap and hold on to gas and water vapor. When high-silica (dacitic) magma rises to the Earth's surface, the trapped gases and vapors can erupt explosively to produce ash clouds and pyroclastic flows that consist of superheated gas, ash and volcanic fragments. Dacite magma that is extruded nonexplosively as lava forms lava domes because it is too viscous (sticky) to flow far away from its source. Low-silica (basaltic) magma is more fluid and usually erupts as lava in less explosive eruptions than dacite because gas and water vapor escape easily from it. Eruptions of basalt magma typically produce elongate lava flows, as well as build cinder cones (piles of small frothy lava fragments or 'cinders') around volcanic vents.|$|E
2500|$|Ando (1980) {{focused on}} {{identifying}} shear-wave anisotropy {{in the upper}} mantle. [...] This study focused on shear wave splitting recorded near the Chubu <b>Volcanic</b> <b>Area</b> in Japan. [...] Using newly implemented telemetric seismographic stations, {{they were able to}} record both P-wave and S-wave arrivals from earthquakes up to 260km beneath the <b>volcanic</b> <b>area.</b> [...] The depths of these earthquakes make this area ideal for studying the structure of the upper mantle. [...] They noted the arrivals of two distinct shear waves with different polarizations (N-S, fast and E-W, slow) approximately 0.7 seconds apart. It was concluded that the splitting was not caused by the earthquake source but by the travel path of the waves {{on the way to the}} seismometers. [...] Data from other nearby stations were used to constrain the source of the seismic anisotropy. [...] He found the anisotropy to be consistent with the area directly below the <b>volcanic</b> <b>area</b> and was hypothesized to occur due to oriented crystals in a deep rooted magma chamber.
