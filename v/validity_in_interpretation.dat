I do not focus here on Szahaj’s detailed objections to the concepts proposed {{by the author of}} <b>Validity</b> <b>in</b> <b>Interpretation.</b> I concentrate instead on the idea that forms the basis for such objections, i. e. radical, cultural interpretative constructivism. As a skeptical intentionalist, I cannot fully share his opinion and, therefore, I draw attention to views according to which the constructivist paradigm is becoming conventionalized and exhausted (especially in the humanities) and to the possible ways in which it can be overcome. </span...|$|E
40|$|Whereas {{psychology}} has particularly studied motivation as a processus, sociology, despite Weber's and Mills's contributions, {{has often}} neglected to conceive {{the status of}} motives. This article tries {{to show that a}} sociological study of motives should contribute {{to a better understanding of}} some religions phenomena which are related to our technological societies. The author describes the motive as an act of social communication and as a function of language, which permits a reconsideration of the problem of redevance and <b>validity</b> <b>in</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Consequently, the sociological study of motives appears to be a way to understand the dynamics of social groups and to establish that socioology is a theory of knowledge.

The collected material covers the production available in the specialised literature in this field over the last 30 years. The whole body of surface science experimental and theoretical tools were exploited. According to the investigated physical properties the paper is divided into six sections including experimental, surface atomic geometry, vibrational properties, electronic properties and adsorption and desorption. The most extended part of the collected material deals with the (100) and (110) GaAs surfaces, InP surfaces were extensively studied as well, though at a reduced extent. As a general result the hydrogenation of GaAs can {{be taken as a}} case study and the consequent picture of general <b>validity</b> <b>in</b> the <b>interpretation</b> of the hydrogenation of all the III-V surfaces.

40|$|Contemporary {{literary}} theorists, {{very much}} aware of themselves as constituting a break in, and a refutation of, an entire classical metaphysics, are trying to prove that James Joyce, the foremost prose writer of the twentieth century, writing when that classical view was falling from grace and the modern perspective was forcing itself upon the intellectual world, is, in fact, in his work [...] all works considered as one work-undermining the very tradition which critics consider his foundation. Consequently, the way in which Ulysses and Finnegans Wake are read and valued will be linked to an entire theory of literature. The body of this paper will comprise a general overview of criticism which has attempted to measure Ulysses subsequent to its publication; an analyzation of the direct influence of one of the earliest language theorists, Giambattista Vico, on Joyce 2 ̆ 7 s Ulysses; a brief review of the classical metaphysics; a detailed presentation of the Deconstructionist position; and an investigation into ways in which Joyce, and Ulysses, may be viewed as Modern and as Contemporary. In the conclusion, the writer, using E. D.

40|$|Literary {{knowledge}} {{represents the}} state of affairs in the holistic nature of literature. Within the scheme of co-ordinates that constitute the holistic nature of literature, legitimate aesthetic experience cannot occur unless a valid interpretation of meaning is considered as the probable intention of the author. Understanding meaning initiates legitimate aesthetic experience {{as opposed to an}} aesthetic awareness that inadvertently distorts authorial intention to satisfy wishfulfilment gratification of the audience. <b>Validity</b> <b>in</b> <b>interpretation</b> implies satisfying the conditions of knowledge, in that agreement in. judgements about literature is possible. Yet, though meaning may satisfy the conditions of objectivity, each legitimate aesthetic experience is peculiar to the individual's empathic relationship to the valid interpretation.. The significance of the text may be an ineffable aesthetic experience which is a self-evident form of knowledge. The synthesis of Hirsch's theory of 'meaning and 'significance' with Hirst's belief that literature is ? 'unique form of knowledge' gives a dual nature to, and foundation for, the epistemological status of literature. Consequently, there is justification for teaching literary knowledge in texts and procedural knowledge for construal of valid interpretation. Interpretation and criticism have different functions. One attempts to give coherence and objectivity to textual meaning, while criticism imbues a valid interpretation with a 'unique' knowledge that is relative to the dynamic of history and the dialectic of criticism. If students are to perceive in some degree the holistic nature of literary knowledge, then trainee teachers ought to be familiar with the synthesis of Hirsch and Hirst which is a primary principle both in the construal of textual meaning and in the attempt to express legitimate aesthetic experience.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the use of}} positive linear and relevant logics to provide logical accounts of static process structure, and combinations of relevance and modality to account also for dynamic behaviour. A general notion of model is introduced, based on which, three examples are given using Milner's synchronous process calculus SCCS. The structure of models is enriched by prefixing operators to cover also dynamic behaviour. Logically dynamic behaviour is captured by adding past and future modal operators. The resulting logic is given sound and complete axiomatlzations and shown to conservatively extend the positive fragment of linear logic. Finally the induced interpretations of formulas on process terms are characterized, and axiomatisations are given which are sound and complete with respect to <b>validity</b> <b>in</b> the process-based <b>interpretations.</b> The completeness proofs are based on rewriting and provide procedures for deciding validity and consistency of formulas {{with respect to the}} process-based interpretations...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} effect, if any, of tax credit legislation for contributions to higher education in Indiana, Michigan, and North Dakota. Secondary purposes were twofold: 1) to discover differences in patterns of giving to public and private institutions of higher education, and 2) to compare existing tax credit laws and develop recommendations for model legislation. Data, collected from published journals and reports of private and governmental agencies, were subjected to analyses for consistency and compatibility in order to assure <b>validity</b> <b>in</b> <b>interpretation.</b> All dollar amounts were converted to 1967 Constant Dollar Values for analysis. Data for voluntary giving in areas of business and corporate giving, non-alumni giving, giving by other groups, and alumni giving for individual institutions were compared with composite national data for giving to higher education. Findings 1. Annual reports of voluntary giving to higher education have presented raw data reflecting a growth of 40 percent for 1970 - 1977, when converted to real dollar purchasing power, a loss in excess of 8 percent is documented. 2. Growth in voluntary giving to institutions studied exceeded growth on a national basis; growth in giving to public institutions far exceeding growth in giving to private institutions. 3. Voluntary giving to higher education by business and industry has declined during a period when growth would have been expected. 4. Tax credit legislation is possible in all states. Conclusions 1. Voluntary giving to higher education in Indiana, Michigan, and Forth Dakota, states having tax credits for gifts to higher education, increased at rates demonstrably greater than the rate of increase for the national composite. 2. Growth in voluntary giving to higher education was directly related to length of time the tax credit law has been in effect. Implications 1. Voluntary giving to higher education is directly related to fund raising campaign efforts causing wide fluctuations in year-to-year levels of giving. 2. Growth in voluntary giving to higher education using a tax credit is related to awareness, a component of fund raising campaigns. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) {{measures}} {{the adequacy of}} asthma treatment as identified by international guidelines. It consists of seven items (5 ×symptoms, rescue bronchodilator use and FEV 1 % of predicted normal). A validation study suggested that in clinical studies measurement of FEV 1 and bronchodilator use may not be needed but this has never formally been tested in a clinical trial. The aims of this analysis were (1) to examine the measurement properties of three shortened versions of the ACQ (symptoms alone, symptoms plus FEV 1 and symptoms plus short-acting β 2 -agonist) and (2) to determine whether using the shortened versions would alter {{the results of a}} clinical trial. In the randomised trial, 552 adults completed the ACQ at baseline and after 13 and 26 weeks of treatment. The analysis showed that the measurement properties of all four versions of the ACQ are very similar. Agreement between the original ACQ and the reduced versions was high (intraclass correlation coefficients: 0. 94 – 0. 99). Mean differences between the ACQ and the shortened versions were less than 0. 04 (on the 7 -point scale). Clinical trial results using the four versions were almost identical with the mean treatment difference ranging from − 0. 09 (P= 0. 17), to − 0. 13 (P= 0. 07). For interpretability, the minimal important difference for all four versions was close to 0. 5. In conclusion, these three shortened versions of the ACQ can be used in large clinical trials without loss of <b>validity</b> or change <b>in</b> <b>interpretation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Falling poses a {{major threat}} to the {{steadily}} growing population of the elderly in modern-day society. A major challenge in the prevention of falls is the identification of individuals who are at risk of falling owing to an unstable gait. At present, several methods are available for estimating gait stability, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we review the currently available measures: the maximum Lyapunov exponent (lS and lL), the maximum Floquet multiplier, variability measures, long-range correlations, extrapolated centre of mass, stabilizing and destabilizing forces, foot placement estimator, gait sensitivity norm and maximum allowable - perturbation. We explain what these measures represent and how they are calculated, andwe assess their validity, divided up into construct <b>validity,</b> predictive <b>validity</b> <b>in</b> simple models, convergent <b>validity</b> <b>in</b> experimental studies, and predictive <b>validity</b> <b>in</b> observational studies. We conclude that (i) the validity of variability measures and lS is best supported across all levels, (ii) the maximum Floquet multiplier and lL have good construct validity, but negative predictive <b>validity</b> <b>in</b> models, negative convergent validity and (for lL) negative predictive <b>validity</b> <b>in</b> observational studies, (iii) long-range correlations lack construct validity and predictive validity inmodels and have negative convergent validity, and (iv) measures derived from perturbation experiments have good construct validity, but data are lacking on convergent <b>validity</b> <b>in</b> experimental studies and predictive <b>validity</b> <b>in</b> observational studies. In closing, directions for future research on dynamic gait stability are discussed. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved...|$|R
