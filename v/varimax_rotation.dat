50|$|Groth and Ghil (2011) have {{demonstrated}} that a classical M-SSA analysis suffers from a degeneracy problem, namely the EOFs do not separate well between distinct oscillations when the corresponding eigenvalues are similar in size. This problem is a shortcoming of principal component analysis in general, not just of M-SSA in particular. In order to reduce mixture effects and to improve the physical interpretation, Groth and Ghil (2011) have proposed a subsequent <b>VARIMAX</b> <b>rotation</b> of the spatio-temporal EOFs (ST-EOFs) of the M-SSA. To avoid a loss of spectral properties (Plaut and Vautard 1994), they have introduced a slight modification of the common <b>VARIMAX</b> <b>rotation</b> that does take the spatio-temporal structure of ST-EOFs into account. Alternatively, a closed matrix formulation of the algorithm for the simultaneous rotation of the EOFs by iterative SVD decompositions has been proposed (Portes and Aguirre, 2016).|$|E

5000|$|In statistics, a <b>varimax</b> <b>rotation</b> is used {{to simplify}} the {{expression}} of a particular sub-space in terms of just a few major items each. The actual coordinate system is unchanged, it is the orthogonal basis that is being rotated to align with those coordinates. The sub-space found with principal component analysis or factor analysis is expressed as a dense basis with many non-zero weights which makes it hard to interpret. Varimax is so called because it maximizes the sum of the variances of the squared loadings (squared correlations between variables and factors). Preserving orthogonality requires that it is a rotation that leaves the sub-space invariant. Intuitively, this is achieved if, (a) any given variable has a high loading on a single factor but near-zero loadings on the remaining factors and if (b) any given factor is constituted by only a few variables with very high loadings on this factor while the remaining variables have near-zero loadings on this factor. If these conditions hold, the factor loading matrix is said to have [...] "simple structure," [...] and <b>varimax</b> <b>rotation</b> brings the loading matrix closer to such simple structure (as much as the data allow). From the perspective of individuals measured on the variables, varimax seeks a basis that most economically represents each individual—that is, each individual can be well described by a linear combination of only a few basis functions.|$|E
50|$|Higher-order factor {{analysis}} is a statistical method consisting of repeating steps {{factor analysis}} - oblique rotation - {{factor analysis of}} rotated factors. Its merit is to enable the researcher to see the hierarchical structure of studied phenomena. To interpret the results, one proceeds either by post-multiplying the primary factor pattern matrix by the higher-order factor pattern matrices (Gorsuch, 1983) and perhaps applying a <b>Varimax</b> <b>rotation</b> to the result (Thompson, 1990) or by using a Schmid-Leiman solution (SLS, Schmid & Leiman, 1957, also known as Schmid-Leiman transformation) which attributes the variation from the primary factors to the second-order factors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Varimax</b> <b>rotation</b> is an {{orthogonal}} {{rotation of}} the factor axes to maximize the variance of the squared loadings of a factor (column) on all the variables (rows) in a factor matrix, which {{has the effect of}} differentiating the original variables by extracted factor. Each factor will tend to have either large or small loadings of any particular variable. A varimax solution yields results which make it as easy as possible to identify each variable with a single factor. This is the most common rotation option. However, the orthogonality (i.e., independence) of factors is often an unrealistic assumption. Oblique rotations are inclusive of orthogonal rotation, and for that reason, oblique rotations are a preferred method.|$|E

These lead to some theoretical considerations of the validity of Western urban theories and concepts since the Hong Kong spatial pattern tends towards a greater degree of regularity. It is also recommended that the orthogonal and oblique rotations can complement each other to give the macro and micro variations of the urban dimensions. ...|$|R

Multivariate treatments using cluster analysis, principal component analysis and factorial design were employed, in which the data were characterised as a function of season and sampling site, thus enabling significant discriminating factors to be discovered. Cluster analysis study based on data which were characterised as a function of sampling sites showed that at a chord distance of 75. 25 two clusters are formed.

All 90 items were scored on 5 -point rating scales. A principal component analysis with orthogonal Procrustes rotation towards the a priori 7 component structure yielded congruence measures (Tucker's phi) of. 82 or less, implying that the original 7 dimensions of the AEQ-A could not be reproduced. A second, explorative principal component analysis produced a three-component solution explaining 27. 8 % of the variance: two unipolar components measuring positive and negative personal and social expectancies, and a bipolar component measuring expectancies regarding cognitive and motor capacities. A cross-validation using a random-split half of the sample and performing <b>VARIMAX</b> <b>rotations</b> on each subsample confirmed this three-component solution, which was further confirmed by an orthogonal Procrustes rotation of the first subsample towards the second revealed. After the elimination of 27 items due to overlapping factor loadings, scales were produced with Cronbach alpha of. 94,. 78 and. 70.

RESEARCH DESIGN: A preliminary questionnaire was drafted containing 78 self report items measuring three behaviours related to oral health (i. e. dietary habits, oral hygiene habits and dental attendance), {{as well as the}} attitudes, perceived social norms and self-efficacy for each behaviour. The questionnaire was completed by 201 health care workers for the initial validation and 966 other health care workers for a replication. OUTCOMES: A principal component analysis with Procrustes rotation toward an a priori three component structure on the original sample yielded high congruence measures for reported dental attendance, but not for dietary habits and oral hygiene habits. Subsequent exploratory <b>Varimax</b> <b>rotations</b> and discarding of redundant items resulted in three component solutions explaining 43 % of the variance in dietary habits, 57 % in oral hygiene habits and 66 % in dental attendance, respectively. For all three behaviours, these components corresponded to the dimensions of the TPB. Internal consistency of the scales was satisfactory, with Chronbach's alpha's ranging from 0. 51 to 0. 87.

However, youth themselves are rarely asked about their needs, and it is unknown if caretakers recognize these needs as such. Using Q-methodology, this study aimed to describe what youth consider their most important needs and if foster parents and foster care professionals are aware of these needs. Participants consisted of 15 foster youth (17 - 25 years old) who reported a history of sexual abuse, and nine foster parents and seven foster care workers who reported having cared for youth who experienced sexual abuse.

The sortings of the foster parents and foster care workers only matched the second and fourth factor, indicating that they recognized these two sets of foster youth’s needs, but not the other two.
