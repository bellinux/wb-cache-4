In some cases, these facilities were dead amidships presenting a perfect target for enemy ships at night. Ready service lockers added to the destruction and {{it was noted that}} these lockers were never close to being depleted. The Commander in Chief would order sweeping changes be made before ships entered surface combat in the future.|$|E
