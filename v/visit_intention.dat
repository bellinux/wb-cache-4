In this study, we empirically investigated the relationship between the components of storytelling, empathy and behavioral intentions. By studying 155 readers, we found that perceived esthetics, narrative structure, self-reference will evoke reader empathy.

40|$|Introduction The National Department of Tourism (NDT) {{identified}} the underutilisation of tourist attractions {{as a challenge}} facing South Africa’s tourism. According to eThekwini Municipality (2014) and Gauteng Provincial Government (2001), domestic business tourists, amongst others, visit tourist attractions. The likelihood of business tourists requesting that hotel front office staff arrange visits to tourist attractions is acknowledged in the literature. There is, however, a dearth of research investigating the relationship between hotel front office staff and business tourists’ <b>intentions</b> to <b>visit</b> tourist attractions (hereafter mostly referred to as business tourists’ <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions).</b> The conceptualisation of this relationship is discussed {{in the context of}} hotel front office staff, interest in tourist attractions, and business tourists’ <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions.</b> The proposed mediating role of Interest in tourist attractions is highlighted, which was tested statistically, while evidence is provided that Hotel front office staff, Interest in tourist attractions, and Business tourists’ <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions</b> can serve in a causal Model of Business Tourist’s <b>Intentions</b> of <b>Visiting</b> Tourist Attractions. The inclusion of these constructs in a causal model will enable hotel and tourist attractions managers develop strategies to attract business tourists. Main research question Against the background of Frazier, Tix and Barron’s (2004) and Ro’s (2012) Mediation Model, see section 1. 3, the following main research question was proposed for the present study: Is the relationship between Hotel front office staff and Business tourists’ <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions</b> mediated by Interest in tourist attractions in a Model of Business Tourists’ <b>Intentions</b> of <b>Visiting</b> Tourist Attractions? Literature review Based on the main research question, this study resulted in the proposal of a theoretical causal model for the mediating role of tourist attractions and a causal Model of Business Tourists’ <b>Intentions</b> of <b>Visiting</b> Tourist Attractions. The likelihood of the newly conceptualised Interest in tourist attractions as a mediator in the relationship between the Hotel front office staff and Business tourists’ <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions</b> is evident in tourism literature. As far as could be determined, the influence of interest in tourist attractions in the relationship between hotel front office staff and business tourists’ <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions</b> has not been established to date. An extensive literature review was conducted to conceptualise hotel front office staff, interest in tourist attractions, and business tourists’ <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions</b> as constructs to include in the theoretical model from which the causal model was developed. Business tourists’ demographic details were investigated in the context of gender, age, and province. Research design A research design comprises the research approach and research method of a study. In the present research, a cross-sectional survey was conducted to generate the study’s primary data. A statistical study design was adopted for the purpose of conducting factor analysis (FA) and validating the causal model by means of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) through structural equation modelling (SEM). Furthermore, this study was causal-explanatory, as it explored the mediating role of Interest in tourist attractions. International Business Machines (IBM) software SPSS 22. 0 was used to conduct this study’s FA, and IBM SPSS AMOS 22. 00 was used for this study’s CFA through SEM. Research method Convenience sampling, which is a non-probability sampling method, was used to select the respondents. The target population was domestic business tourists who stayed at the selected three-star hotel between 15 July 2014 and 15 April 2015. A new measuring instrument was developed to comprehensively investigate hotel front office staff, interest in tourist attractions, and business tourists’ <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions.</b> A seven-point intensity Likert scale was used for all items in the questionnaire. Data were collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire issued to domestic business tourists upon hotel check-in. The sample comprised 282 respondents. Results and discussion Data sets for all constructs were inspected for central tendency, distribution, and missing values. Missing values were replaced by the respective items’ mean score. Once inspected, PCA was conducted to explore the uni-dimensionality of items, and to reduce constructs. All constructs were retained by the PCA, and the achievement of Cronbach alpha scores exceeding. 70 confirmed the validity and reliability of constructs (Hotel front office staff, Interest in tourist attractions, and Business tourists’ <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions).</b> PCA was not conducted on Business Tourists’ <b>Visiting</b> <b>Intentions,</b> due to a significant Cronbach’s alpha and the presence of only four items measuring the construct. Pearson’s product-moment correlation revealed positive inter-correlations between dimensions of the constructs Hotel front office staff and Interest in tourist attractions. CFA was conducted to establish the causal Model of Business Tourists’ <b>Intentions</b> of <b>Visiting</b> Tourist Attractions. The establishment of a causal model was followed by exploring the mediating effect of Interest in tourist attractions on the relationship between Hotel front office staff and Business tourists’ <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions.</b> The causal model confirmed that Interest in tourist attractions fully mediates the relationship between Hotel front office staff and Business tourists’ <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions.</b> This successfully answered this study’s main research question. This study makes a unique contribution by establishing a causal Model of Business Tourists’ <b>Intentions</b> of <b>Visiting</b> Tourist Attractions, confirming Interest in tourist attractions as a mediator in the relationship between Hotel front office staff and Business tourists’ <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions.</b> The causal model proves that there is no relationship between Hotel front office staff and Business tourists’ <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions</b> without the indirect connection with Interest in tourist attractions. In support of this study’s results, Yang, Jou, and in tourist attractions, and business tourists’ <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions.</b> A seven-point intensity Likert scale was used for all items in the questionnaire. Data were collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire issued to domestic business tourists upon hotel check-in. The sample comprised 282 respondents.

In support of this study’s results, Yang, Jou, and Cheng (2011) asserted that business tourists expect hotels to arrange their visits to tourist attractions. According to Kasavana and Brooks (2009), it is a duty of the hotel front office staff to arrange visits to tourist attractions. Limitations This study was limited to domestic business tourists only, thereby excluding international business tourists. A non-probability sampling method was used to select respondents; this study’s results can therefore not be generalised to the population of domestic business tourists who stay at the selected three-star hotel in Pretoria. This study’s sample was uneven in the context of gender, age, and province of residence. Future research Future studies could explore the established causal Model of Business Tourists’ <b>Intentions</b> of <b>Visiting</b> Tourist Attractions at a different hotel, to verify the validity of the model. Future studies could also explore the moderating effect of domestic business tourists with regard to age, gender, and province of residence in the relationship between Hotel front office staff and Interest in tourist attractions. Future studies could further explore the causal Model of Business Tourists’ <b>Intentions</b> of <b>Visiting</b> Tourist Attractions using a different biographical segment, e. g., leisure tourists. Conclusion This study aimed to determine whether scores for Hotel front office staff related to scores for Business tourists’ <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions,</b> and how this relationship is mediated by scores on Tourist attractions scores. The Model of Business Tourists’ <b>Intentions</b> of <b>Visiting</b> Tourist Attractions confirmed that Interest in tourist attractions fully mediates the relationship between Hotel front office staff and Business tourists’ <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions.</b> Based on these results, this study’s main research objective has been achieved.

Specifically, the social influence variables of friendly staff, friendship with a staff employee and feeling respected are compared with tangible attributes, such as rooms, facilities and locational convenience to determine the greatest influence. A cross-sectional survey of 119 motel guests revealed that feeling respected is the greatest influence on revisit intentions but {{was not a significant}} predictor of word of mouth activity. Furthermore, both facilities and motel convenience were not significant predictors of either repeat <b>visit</b> <b>intentions</b> or word of mouth. Both friendship and room presentation were significant predictors of both dependent variables. It is suggested that the nature of the dependent variable may account for the different results. For public activities such as word of mouth, predictors that guests may favour talking about could dominate whereas private feelings such as feeling respected may more strongly predict the more introspective service outcomes.

The results of structural equation analyses showed that OI is a positive function of ATGB and that OI significantly affects VI, WOMI, and WPM. Additionally, the findings from a structural modeling comparison revealed that OI completely mediates the effect of ATGB on components of behavioral intentions. Subsequent tests for metric invariances demonstrated that the relationships among study variables were generally stronger among females and high age groups.

Methods 517 randomly selected adult public dental patients completed a questionnaire assessing dental attitudes and beliefs which was matched with electronic records for past and future dental service use. A questionnaire measured intentions, attitudes, subjective norms and perceptions of behavioural control and self-efficacy in relation to visiting public dentists. A measure of dental attendance at public dental clinics was obtained retrospectively (over 3 1 / 2 years) and prospectively (over a one year period following the return of the questionnaire) by accessing electronic patient clinical records.

Even if it is generally accepted that telepresence mediates information to attitudes and behavioural intention, f~w destination image studies include telepresence as a part of image formation models. Since the adoption ofInformation Technology (IT) to tourism as both communication and distribution channel tools, the importance of conceptualising and developing a destination image virtualised by DMOs' Websites become all the more obvious. Moreover, few studies. have applied the defmition of a destination image to the Web environment by focusing on its conceptualisation and empirical development at the same time. Therefore, the main aim ofthis study is to develop and empirically examine the concept of a Virtual Destination Image Formation (VDIF) model by adopting a hierarchical-based attitude model (e;g., Integrated information response model). This research adds new aspects to traditional image models: telepresence, Web-usage motivations; virtual information, multiple item-based behavioural responses which are traditionally measured by a single item such as <b>visit</b> <b>intention.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The South African National Department of Tourism has {{recently}} initiated the National Tourism Sector Strategy aimed at developing a sustainable tourism economy, {{and making the}} country a Top 20 global tourism destination by 2020. China is one of South Africa’s major non-African sources of tourist arrivals. To ensure a growing share of this booming market, South African tourism scholars and practitioners have {{to pay close attention}} to the behaviour of Chinese outbound tourists, particularly their destination choice behaviour. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) – an extension of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) – can serve as a basis for researching destination choice. According to the TPB literature, intention is the most immediate and important determinant of behaviour. Three direct predictors of intention, namely, attitude, subjective norms, and perceived control, are functions of latent behavioural, normative, and control beliefs, respectively. The TPB is parsimonious but open to the inclusion of additional predictors if there is evidence that these predictors may explain a significant proportion of the variance in intention and behaviour after the basic predictors (attitude, subjective norms, and perceived control) have been accounted for. The current research successfully extended the TPB model for predicting potential Chinese tourists’ intentions to visit South Africa by adding two additional variables: travel motivation and travel constraints. The push-pull motivation framework discussed in the study postulates that people travel because they are pushed by internal forces (inner needs) and pulled by external forces (destination attributes). Typical barriers to travel include intrapersonal, interpersonal, and structural constraints. The new model makes an important contribution to the literature on destination choice, and provides South Africa’s destination marketers with suggestions for attracting and serving Chinese tourists. In addition, the research shows that both travel motivation and travel constraints can be used as bases for segmenting the outbound Chinese tourist market interested in visiting South Africa. A survey approach and a structured questionnaire distributed electronically to the online panel members of a Chinese market research company were instrumental in collecting the empirical data for the study. The questionnaire was originally written in English and translated into Chinese (Mandarin) via a blind translation-back-translation method. Attitude, subjective norms, perceived control, and <b>visit</b> <b>intention</b> were all operationalised as unidimensional and used scales adapted from previous studies. New scales were developed for travel motivation and travel constraints – both operationalised as multidimensional. Quota sampling, used to identify respondents aged 18 or older and living in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, resulted in 630 usable questionnaires obtained from 1, 510 sent invitation e-mails, yielding a response rate of 41. 7 %. The raw data collected were prepared through the sequential steps of editing, coding, and filing, and then analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Descriptive analysis suggested that broadening personal horizons, viewing the natural scenery, and seeing something different were the top motives for visiting South Africa, while language, fear of crime, and lack of travel companions were the top barriers to visiting South Africa. According to the factor analysis, travel motivation had three underlying dimensions – learning, escape, and aesthetics and appreciation, while operational, risk and fear, and social barriers were three underlying dimensions of travel constraints. Regression analysis showed that the proposed extended TPB model had higher predictive power for <b>visit</b> <b>intention</b> than both TRA and TPB models; the basic predictors – attitude, subjective norms, and perceived control – all {{had a significant impact on}} visit intention; and in terms of the additional predictors, learning, operational constraints, and social constraints had a significant impact on <b>visit</b> <b>intention.</b> The analysis of variance indicated that travel frequency and age were the most profound background factors with an influence on the extended TPB model. Finally, cluster analysis resulted in two market segments with distinct profiles, that is, High-Motivation/ Low-Constraint (HMLC) tourists and Low-Motivation/High-Constraint (LMHC) tourists. Based on the theoretical and empirical findings of the current research, it is recommended that destination marketers in South Africa: advertise specific benefits of touring South Africa, namely, increasing knowledge, relieving stress, and enjoying high environmental quality, to advance Chinese residents’ perceptions of the country; develop tourism experiences that can be taken in a week or shorter to cater for the unique annual leave and public holiday policy in China; launch a media relations campaign in China to ensure that the facts about South Africa are communicated without distortion; collaborate with other destination stakeholders such as government and businesses, to actively attract and retain Chinese tourists for example by educating the public about Chinese culture and training employees to improve the quality of service; target the HMLC tourists via the Internet (particularly the social media) and by developing holiday packages that include activities related to cultural tourism, rest and relaxation, and nature-based tourism; and target the LMHC tourists by cooperating with local travel agencies and by developing holiday packages that highlight the diversity of tourism activities and offer value-added products/service...|$|E
40|$|Background There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} {{of the influence of}} psychosocial factors and health beliefs on public dental patient's patterns of service use in Australia. The research aims were to examine associations between dental attitudes and beliefs of public dental service users and dental <b>visiting</b> <b>intention</b> and behaviour using the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Methods 517 randomly selected adult public dental patients completed a questionnaire assessing dental attitudes and beliefs which was matched with electronic records for past and future dental service use. A questionnaire measured intentions, attitudes, subjective norms and perceptions of behavioural control and self-efficacy in relation to visiting public dentists. A measure of dental attendance at public dental clinics was obtained retrospectively (over 3 1 / 2 years) and prospectively (over a one year period following the return of the questionnaire) by accessing electronic patient clinical records. Results Participants had positive attitudes, subjective norms and self-efficacy beliefs towards dental visiting but perceived a lack of control over visiting the dentist. Attitudes, subjective norms, self-efficacy and perceived control were significant predictors of intention (P < 0. 05). Intentions, self-efficacy and past dental attendance were significant predictors of actual dental attendance (P < 0. 05). Conclusion Public dental patients held favourable attitudes and beliefs but perceived a lack of control towards dental visiting. Reducing structural barriers may therefore improve access to public dental services. Liana Luzzi and A John Spence...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to assess the recreational value (access value) provided by Yuelu Mountain Park in China applying travel cost method (TCM) which is commonly used to estimate non-market benefits. Also, a fee that would maximize the entrance fee income is tentatively calculated. The potential trips to be lost next year are estimated based on local respondents <b>visiting</b> <b>intentions</b> among different age groups. The travel cost demand function is estimated by using basic count data travel cost model-Poisson regression, and survey data collected on-site. Average access values per trip were estimated to be € 0. 75 for local and € 64. 52 for non-local individuals producing aggregate annual access value of € 20. 43 million. Based on the travel cost demand function, an entrance fee of € 5. 43 would maximize the revenue collected from the visitors. This would mean more than doubling of the present entrance fee. The result could potentially be utilized when deciding on the entrance fees. It is also suggested that the park management could further study visitors' intentions and reasons either to visit or not to visit the park in the future. Estimated consumer surpluses as well as suggested entrance fee must however, be considered with caution because truncation of the on-site survey data is not accounted for in the Poisson model estimations of this study...|$|R

40|$|Given that Pahang, {{being the}} largest state in Peninsula Malaysia is {{targeting}} more tourists visit, it is proposed to use advertisement featuring sports celebrities to increase potential consumers’ awareness and to spark their interest {{to travel to}} Taman Negara National Park. This study has investigated the effectiveness of using of celebrity endorsement especially using sports celebrities (national and international) to promote ecotourism in Malaysia’s National Park. Besides, this study also looked into which endorser (local or foreign sports celebrity) had more celebrity credibility in a print advertisement to influence consumer <b>visit</b> <b>intention</b> pertaining to ecotourism. Additionally, this study would help to identify Malaysian consumers’ environmental values (consisting of eco-centrism, conservation values and sustainable tourism) which {{play an important role}} to influence attitude toward the ecotourism destination. A review of existing literature relating to celebrity endorsement and ecotourism were made in order to grasp some background knowledge on this research area. After that, Chapter 3 Research Methodology explained the data collection method i. e. self-administrated questionnaire. There were three sets of surveys used which each having stimulus material i. e. advertisement created – ad without celebrity; ad with local sport figure; and ad with international sport figure which were randomly given to the samples. Convenience sampling was used yet with an endeavour to attain a balanced and heterogeneous sample. Followed to that, 305 questionnaires with collected data were presented in Chapter 4 titled Data Analysis and Finding after data screening. For data analysis, statistical analysis employed were descriptive analysis, measurement of central tendencies, independent sample t-test, correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis. Based on the conceptual framework, there were 14 hypotheses. After conducting respective tests, eight hypotheses were accepted and six were rejected. Overall, the conceptual model was valid as examined using regression analysis. In Chapter 5 - Discussion, recommendation and conclusion, the results were discussed with the support from literature review. Lastly, the research was completed with a conclusion and recommendations as well as appendices that were attached with the necessary documents for this study...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that special events have become key {{components}} of the tourism development strategy for many regions, the amount of research that has been conducted {{within the field of}} special events does not reflect its importance. It is unlikely that the substantial growth rate that the field of special events has experienced in recent years is sustainable and an understanding of consumer patronage in relation to special events will be crucial for the development and promotion of events in the future. This study seeks to help address these shortcomings. In seeking to understand the field of special events, a model that involved the perspectives of six major parties was proposed. The fundamental aim {{of this study was to}} explore one of these perspectives, namely, that of consumers. This perspective was then used as the basis for a proposed consumer decision making model in relation to visitor attractions, including special events, that underpinned the second part of the thesis. The first part of this study sought to conceptualise systematically, special events from a consumer perspective and to conduct a comparative methodological assessment of three approaches to market segmentation in terms of their ability to explain consumer behaviour in relation to special events. The three approaches used were personal values, psychographics and demographics. A comprehensive and systematic literature review was conducted to identify the attributes that could be used to categorise an event as ‘special’. Based upon this review, a schema of event categories was proposed as well as a listing of the core and qualifying attributes that could be used to describe each of the special event categories. A set of definitions for each of the main special event categories was then developed. In order to operationalise the term ‘special event’, primary research was then conducted to identify the attributes that consumers believed were important in describing a special event. Several distinct measuring techniques, including elicitation, attribute rating and conjoint analysis, were used in the questionnaire for this part of the study, in an effort to derive a comprehensive view of the consumer understanding of special events and to facilitate the convergent validation of the various techniques. It was found that there were four principal attributes that consumers used to describe a special event, these being: the number of attendees, the international attention due to the event, the improvement to the image and pride of the host region as a result of hosting the event, and the exciting experience associated with the event. The study also found a high degree of convergence between the techniques used. The second part of this study sought to understand and predict consumer behaviour in relation to visitor attractions in general, and special events in particular. This further developed the consumer perspective that was the key underlying theme of the thesis. In the second part of this study, 500 randomly selected Melbourne residents were asked to indicate their visit behaviour in relation to a range of visitor attractions including special events. Three dimensions of visit behaviour were measured in order to overcome limitations noted in earlier studies. The visit dimensions used were actual visitation, visit interest and <b>visit</b> <b>intention.</b> This enabled analysis of respondents’ visit behaviour on three dimensions to be assessed at both the generic level and at the individual attraction level. Being an origin-based study, unlike most of the studies that have been conducted in this field which have been destination-based, enabled consumers and non-consumers alike to be considered. Although the consumer decision making model, referred to earlier, which was used in this part of the study, included a range of variables thought to impact upon the consumer decision process, the focus of this thesis was on the comparative abilities of personal values, psychographics and demographics to explain consumer behaviour. Personal values were measured in the questionnaire via the List of Values (LOV) and psychographics were measured using a battery of AIO statements (Activity, Interest and Opinion). Assessing the explanatory power of three techniques on three dimensions of visitation to a wide range of visitor attractions enabled a systematic evaluation to be conducted that was more methodologically rigorous than many of the other studies that have been reported in this field.

Based on the research that has been reported on the importance of personal values to consumers, it would be expected that values should have substantial explanatory power. The fact that the LOV was not able to provide substantial explanatory power in relation to special events in this study was suggested to be related to the measurement of values as opposed to a more fundamental problem with values themselves. Results of this study questioned the comprehensiveness of the LOV. The finding that none of the variables used in this study was able to account for a large percentage of consumer behaviour suggested strongly that there were other important independent variables not measured in this study.

While the traditional emphasis on sales maintains its status, repeat purchasing or repeat travel demonstrates great potentials {{in terms of its}} size and economic contribution. However, the repeat travel market, particularly the international market, has been understudied. Theoretically, this study was built upon the theories of consumer decision processes and the purchase-consumption feedback loop particularly in consumer behavior, leisure, and tourism studies. It was found that travelers 2 ̆ 7 decision processes do not cease once the trip in a destination is completed, instead their experiences with the destination {{will have an impact on}} their decisions on future visitation and the post-evaluation of the destination mediates between their present visit experiences and their revisits intentions. The structure of destination involvement was applied to explain the complicated process of travel experience as a relationship between a traveler and a destination. The causal relationship of destination involvement and repeat <b>visit</b> <b>intentions</b> was assessed via the mediation of satisfaction in the context of long-haul pleasure travel. The validity of the causal relationship provides a reliable theoretical foundation for the destination marketers to segment the potential repeat travel market and predict the travelers 2 ̆ 7 revisit potentials based on their destination involvement profiles during their current or recent visits in the destination. Given the key destination involvement variables, the destination marketers will be able to categorize the travelers, detect their influential facets in their involvement profile, and predict their revisit intentions.
