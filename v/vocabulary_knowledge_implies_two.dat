40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop and {{implement}} a program for learning second language (L 2) academic vocabulary with the objective of enhancing vocabulary learning strategies for reading proficiency and comprehension. This specially tailored program, based on language learning research, consists of five alternative strategies in order to identify ways of learning academic vocabulary for university level efl learners. <b>Vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> not only <b>implies</b> being familiar with the meaning of a word, but also with its form (spoken, written, and its affixation) and its uses (collocations, grammatical pattern, and limits of its use). My experience as an english teacher of university students is that learners have considerable technical vocabulary because they are required to read texts in english related to their field of study. For that reason, their word knowledge is merely related to meaning by translation. GuayaquilMagister en Enseñanza del Inglés como Lengua Extranjer...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the role played by learners' <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> in their reading comprehension performance. It intends to determine whether the breadth and depth of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> are related to EFL learners' reading comprehension, and to investigate which one of these variables, that is, depth or breadth of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge,</b> makes a more important contribution to reading comprehension. Finally, it attempts to investigate whether there is a relationship between these two dimensions of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The participants of the study were 58 EFL Iranian students of Intensive English Course (IEC) in UTM based on purposive non-random sampling. To collect data, three tests were administered to the students during their class time to measure the students’ breadth and depth of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> along with their reading comprehension ability. The results obtained from the analysis of the data indicated that while both breadth and depth of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> play an important role in EFL learners' reading comprehension performance, depth of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> makes a more important contribution. The results further revealed that depth and breadth of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> are positively correlated, that is, those learners who had large vocabulary size tend to have a deeper knowledge of the words, too...|$|R

Both aspects of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge,</b> breadth and depth, continue to play roles in vocabulary research. Few studies, however, have focused on which aspect plays the predominant role in L 2 reading. Using three language tests [...] -the GRE (Graduate Record Examinations) for reading comprehension, Nation's (1990) Vocabulary Levels Test, and Read's (1998) Word Associates Test [...] -and verbal reports, the general {{purpose of the study}} was to examine the relationship between <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> and reading comprehension, and the specific focus was to find out which aspect of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge,</b> breadth or depth, has greater impact on determining reading comprehension performance.

40|$|Background: Children {{who have}} poor <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{are at risk}} of wider {{language}} weaknesses and reading comprehension difficulties, which will impact upon their educational achievement. The central question addressed in this paper is how best to teach new vocabulary items to these children. Aims: To investigate the effects of two different methods of teaching vocabulary on both <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> and reading comprehension. Methods & Procedures: Twenty-four children (aged 7 – 8 years) with poor existing <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> took part in an intervention study. Half the children were taught new vocabulary items using definitions; the other half were taught a strategy for deriving meanings from written context. Tests of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> were given before teaching, immediately after teaching and 3 months later. Outcomes & Results: Immediately after teaching, both groups had improved equivalently in <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> for the taught words. However, 3 months later, the context group showed significantly better expressive <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The context group went on to show significantly better comprehension of text containing a number of the taught words and demonstrated that they could use the newly acquired strategy independently to derive meanings from written context. Conclusions: The context method developed is effective in increasing <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> and improving reading comprehension in children with poor existing <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and this is therefore recommended for use with children who require extra help developing vocabulary and comprehension skills...|$|R

The focus is on three different areas of productive vocabulary use: lexical diversity (i. e. the proportion of different words in a text), lexical sophistication (i. e. the proportion of advanced words in a text) and lexical density (i. e. the proportion of content words in a text). The results of a bivariate correlation analysis indicate that there is a moderate relationship between learners’ receptive <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> and lexical diversity of the texts they produce; there is a weak relationship between their receptive <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> and lexical sophistication in the texts; and there is no relationship between their receptive <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> and lexical density...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{looks at the}} {{internal}} structure of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> along the receptive and productive continuum under a multi-aspect framework. It examines the receptive knowledge of meaning, form, morphology, collocation and association and explores their relationship with productive <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> over time through a multi-task approach. Participants were 513 Year 8 EFL learners from two junior high schools in southern China. They completed two identical sets of five different vocabulary tests in a pre- and post-test design with a four-month interval. The five vocabulary tests captured five different receptive aspects of and the productive use of 26 target words. Correlation and regression analyses were {{used to examine the}} relationships among different receptive aspects and between receptive aspects and the productive word use, and the changes of their relationships over time. Results show that as learners’ <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> develops their receptive knowledge of form, meaning, morphology, association and collocation together explains a stable amount of variance in productive <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The proportion of individual contribution from the five receptive aspects to productive word use changes over time. As learners’ productive <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> improves, their receptive knowledge of association and collocation becomes more and more important. The findings suggest that the receptive knowledge learners draw upon in their productive word use varies depending on their level of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and growth in depth of word knowledge would be needed as productive <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> progresses. This study offers a new perspective on the developmental pattern from receptive to productive <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> that refines the theoretical framework of receptive-productive <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and could inspire future research addressing the puzzle of how a word develops from receptive to productive use.

In addition, different relationships of paradigmatic relations, syntagmatic relations, analytic relations and morphological knowledge with reading comprehension are explored. At last, the paper suggests a conceptual framework of depth of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> and its relationship with academic reading comprehension, and future research works need to encompass paradigmatic relations, syntagmatic relations, analytic relations and morphological knowledge as integral parts of depth of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> in relation with academic reading comprehension...|$|R

40|$|Measurements of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> are {{powerful}} indicators of language proficiency, as they correlate with other language skills (Milton 2013; Stæhr 2009). It is evident to all L 2 educators that L 2 <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{is an essential}} component of L 2 competency. The underlying constructs of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> are generally accepted as consisting of multiple dimensions (Milton 2013). Among these <b>knowledge</b> dimensions, <b>vocabulary</b> fluency, or the ability to access and apply <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> under time constraints, is arguably one of the most important. This is especially the case in regard to the ability to apply existing L 2 <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> in a communicatively competent manner. This paper asserts that the ability to apply <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> in a fluent manner has been systemically undervalued in contemporary L 2 educational contexts. In support of this assertion, empirical data drawn from the results of two equivalent vocabulary tests administered among a cohort of 113 tertiary-level L 2 learners are presented. Results showed significantly lower mean vocabulary scores on the fluency dependent (FD) test than those attained by the cohort on the fluency non-dependent (FND) test. The implications of this significant discrepancy between these two measures of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>knowledge</b> are discussed. The paper concludes that the cohorts’ FD knowledge of high frequency and academic words was significantly lower than their FND knowledge of those same categories of words. These results encourage an invigoration of teaching, testing, and learning approaches that emphasize the development of FD word knowledge.
