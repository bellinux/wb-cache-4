40|$|The {{creation}} of the <b>vocational</b> <b>baccalauréat</b> track in 1985 contributed to a main innovation in the French initial secondary education system. In its objective and in its innovative way of learning combining sandwich courses (work and school places learning), this program offer students who were at school in a failure situation a path for continuing their studies or a springboard to jump into a new career or professional plan. This diploma has been implemented in different ways: through student status or in apprenticeships, and through {{the responsibility of the}} Ministry of Education in vocational high schools but also, under the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture like in the Maisons Familiales Rurales (MFR). First, this paper will present the institutional framework: what is the <b>Vocational</b> <b>Baccalauréat</b> (VETBac) <b>diploma,</b> its roles and purposes? And as the national French system of education from the Ministry of education has been the subjects of number of articles in European VET reviews (Gendron, 2005), it will be presented more in details the MFR system less known and its philosophy. The second part, briefly developed here, will give some views of the convergence and divergence of the conditions of competence development of <b>vocational</b> <b>baccalauréat</b> trainees or students with a workplace learning focus in those two previous organizations.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this article}} we wish to clarify not only if, but also how - through which {{institutional}} settings - higher education (HE) is accessed by students from vulnerable immigrant groups in France, Switzerland and Canada.

We analyse using panel data in each country the accessibility of different pathways to HE while taking into account the characteristics of the students. In terms of educational mobility, in France the democratization of the educational system, including the development of the <b>vocational</b> <b>baccalauréat,</b> has enabled more youths of immigrant background to access HE.

5000|$|Such popular educations {{were also}} a major feature of May '68 and of the {{following}} decenie, leading in particular {{to the establishment of}} the University of Paris VIII: Vincennes—Saint-Denis in Paris, in 1969. The Vincennes University (now located in Saint-Denis) was first a [...] "Experimental University Center," [...] with an interest in reshaping relations between students and teachers (so-called [...] "mandarins", in reference to the bureaucrats of Imperial China, for their authority and classic, Third Republic pedagogy) as well as between the university itself and society. Thus, Vincennes was largely opened to those who did not have their <b>baccalauréat</b> <b>diploma,</b> as well as to foreigners. Its courses were focused on Freudo-Marxism, psychoanalysis, Marxist theory, cinema, theater, urbanism or artificial intelligence. Famous intellectuals such as Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan and others held seminars there, in full classrooms where no seats could be found. The assistance was very heterogeneous. For instance, musicians such as Richard Pinhas assisted at Deleuze's courses, and after having written the Anti-Oedipus (1972) with Félix Guattari, Deleuze used to say that non-specialists had best understood their work. Furthermore, Vincennes had no amphitheatres, representatives of the mandarin teacher facing and dominating several hundred students silently taking notes. It also enforced a strict equality between professors and teaching assistants. The Student Revolt continued throughout the 1970s in both Vincennes and the University of Paris X: Nanterre, created in 1964. In 1980, the Minister of Education Alice Saunier-Seité imposed the transfer of Vincennes' University to Saint-Denis. Although education was normalized in the 1980s, during the Mitterrand era, in both Saint-Denis and Vincennes, these universities have retained a less traditional outlook than the classic Sorbonne, where courses tend to be more conservative and sociological composition more middle-upper class.|$|R

40|$|Une étude des activités et des trajectoires de bacheliers professionnels industriels laisse apparaître des décalages importants {{par rapport}} à ce qui était {{initialement}} attendu. Ces écarts invitent à reconsidérer les hypothèses, sur les transformations de l'organisation du travail, sur les modernisations techniques en œuvre dans les entreprises, qui ont présidé à la création de ce nouveau cursus scolaire. Lorsque des réorganisations s'opèrent, elles ne remettent pas en question la division du travail, comme cela était escompté. La polyvalence est la forme que prend l'évolution du travail des ouvriers. L'activité des bacheliers employés en fabrication, maintenance, demeure donc essentiellement un travail de fabrication/intervention. Il n'intègre pas de composante amélioration : de produit, de procédé, d'équipement. Les modernisations techniques n'ont pas toujours l'ampleur et les effets attendus sur les contenus d'activité. Si les bacheliers professionnels de spécialité électrique tirent profit de l'accent mis en cours de formation sur les aspects technique/automatisme, il n'en va pas de même des diplômés de spécialité mécanique. Ceux-ci sont confrontés à un apprentissage délicat de savoirs professionnels, notamment dans l'usinage. Patrick Veneau and Philippe Mouy, From the goals to reality. The industrial <b>vocational</b> « <b>baccalauréats</b> ». The {{results of a}} study on the activities and the occupational trajectories of industrial <b>vocational</b> « <b>baccalauréat</b> »- holders in France show the existence of some wide gaps between the situation as it is and the initial expectations. These gaps suggest {{that there is a need}} to reconsider the hypotheses (about the organization of work and the ways in which technical modernisation is being carried out within firms) on which the creation of this new type of school course was based. Contrary to what was expected to occur, it is not the distribution of tasks which is reorganised whenever a re-organisation takes place. The workers tend rather to acquire a variety of different tasks. Now the tasks of « baccalauréat »-holders employed on a production line and/or in a maintenance capacity will always consist mainly of production and maintenance jobs. There is no scope for finding ways of improving the product, the process or the equipment. Technical reforms do not always affect the contents of workers' activity to the extent or in the way they were intended to do. Although electricity specialists with <b>vocational</b> « <b>baccalauréats</b> » may be able to benefit from what they learned during their training about general technical matters and automation, the same cannot be said of those who have specialized in mechanics : these young apprentices often find they have to start learning some rather delicate skills, such as how to handle machine tools. find they have to start learning some rather delicate skills, such as how to handle machine tools.

Wenn eine Reorganisation stattfindet, so wird dadurch nicht wie erwartet die Arbeitsteilung in Frage gestellt. Die Arbeit des Arbeiters wird vielseitig. Die Tätigkeit der in der Fabrikation, Wartung eingestellten Fachabiturienten bleibt in erster Linie eine Arbeit der Fabrikation/lntervention.
