40|$|Abstract. There {{exists a}} high risk of water-inrush in mining activities. Therefore, it is {{critical}} to develop a conceptual model of Mine Water-inrush, especially for the underground environment. The general structure of Mine Water-inrush Simulation System consists of core network, the underground monitoring network, and the operational system. Through the application of data processing system, simulation system and the application system, the original data can be processed. The results is then passed to the operators and managers, which require them increase the understanding of factors leading to accidents and consequently take action to improve mining safety. This new water-inrush model captures three characteristics to regard the mine water-inrush: the inrush sources, inrush process, and submerging process. <b>Virtual</b> <b>length</b> has been applied to the model, which is combined with a Traversal Algorithm, can be used to calculate the area of increased influence over time for each process.

The single-edge precracked-beam (SEPB) fracture toughness method has been investigated using finite element methods to analyze the stress intensity (K 1) resulting from variations in bridge span, punch <b>length,</b> and <b>virtual</b> crack <b>length.</b> A two-dimensional half-plane, semi-infinite model was used to approximate the stress intensity from a fit of the nodal displacements of a crack face under SEPB loading conditions.

40|$|Columns are {{the most}} {{critical}} elements in structural systems. They may fail catastrophically in buildings exposed to bomb blast, {{which could lead to}} progressive collapse of the entire structure. Past global blast events have shown that preventing progressive collapse would significantly reduce the number of casualties and minimize structural damage. Hence, columns in existing critical facilities must be upgraded to resist the effects of blast loads in order to minimize the risk of fatalities, injuries, and damage costs. To predict the behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) structures under blast load, single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) dynamic analysis can be used. However, in this analysis the force-displacement relationship (also called resistance function) of the structural member must be identified. An idealized resistance function can be established by simply specifying the moment capacity and the corresponding curvature for the section at different load levels, like yield level (My) and ultimate level (Mu) and by knowing the equivalent plastic hinge length (Lp). This length can be predicted using one of the models available in the literature. In RC columns exposed to catastrophic events (e. g., significant earthquake, significant blast or impact) plastic hinges form at maximum moment regions where the most damage occurs. Plastic hinge length (Lp) can be defined as the <b>virtual</b> <b>length</b> over which the plastic curvature is assumed to be constant. The rotation over a cantilever RC member can be computed by integrating curvatures along the member length if Lp is known, from which the tip displacement can be computed; and vice versa. For this reason it is essential to predict the plastic hinge length with acceptable accuracy since it is a key step in correlating the section-level response to the member level response of a concrete column. Indeed, the plasticity spreads over a larger physical length, referred to as the yield length (Ly). The yield length is the distance between the critical section and the location where the tension steel reaches its yield stress. Hence, the plastic hinge length can be expressed as Lp= 3 ̆b 2 Ly, where 3 ̆b 2 is a dimensionless reduction factor for the curvature distribution near the support and it is always smaller than 1. 0. While a large number of studies were carried out to estimate the plastic hinge length formed in un-retrofitted RC beams and columns subjected to monotonic or cyclic loading, only a very limited studies were conducted to investigate the plastic hinge formation mechanism in FRP-jacketed RC columns. No experimental investigation has been conducted so far to compute the plastic hinge length of RC concrete elements exposed to blast effects despite the importance of this parameter in establishing the resistance function. This function in turn is essential in obtaining the blast response of the member using SDOF model. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present the experimental evidence of the enhancement of the structural performance of RC columns when retrofitted by CFRP laminate. The focus will be on the ductility enhancement by increasing the deformation capacities and plastic hinges length. This paper presents part of the results of a large study to develop high performance protection systems for concrete columns subjected to blast loads. The results show that columns retrofitted with CFRP laminate have higher blast resistance, significantly higher ductility in terms of longer plastic hinge compared to non-retrofitted columns. Columns retrofitted with CFRP laminate containing woven 1452 ̆da CFRP fabrics developed longer yield lengths than those that had unidirectional fabrics only when subjected to the same blast loads. Hence, CFRP strengthening laminate including woven 1452 ̆da CFRP fabric improved the ductility of the column. It can also be concluded that when the applied lateral load is less than the column lateral capacity, the residual axial load reached 95...|$|E

30|$|This {{property}} {{was found to}} hold true for longer arrays as well. In general, the FE technique seems to permit, with reasonable effort and good quality of the resulting beam patterns, the achievement of <b>virtual</b> <b>lengths</b> exceeding the actual size by approximately one wavelength or slightly more. This is not surprising, however, as similar results are mentioned in the literature dealing with band-limited signal extrapolation. Indeed, in [9], it is shown that a band-limited signal after truncation in the time domain can be extrapolated, with reasonable effort and accuracy, over an interval exceeding the truncation window by a very few times the inverse of the signal bandwidth. Attempts to do better soon conflict with feasibility issues. From the above, we can argue {{that the benefits of}} FE are especially valuable for relatively small arrays, with size say up to a few wavelengths, when adding a further (albeit virtual) wavelength to the array size produces a significant directivity upgrade.|$|R

Participants experienced, through a head-tracked stereo head-mounted display a virtual body coincident with their real body. There were 5 conditions in a between-groups experiment, with 10 participants per condition. In all conditions there was visuo-motor congruence between the real and virtual dominant arm.

30|$|The third {{category}} aims at relieving the last packet problem which often causes large latency in networks with dynamic short-lived or low-rate flows. For this purpose, the delay-based back-pressure scheduling in [14] assigns link weight based on packet delay instead of queue length differential. Ref. [13] proposes an adaptive redundancy technique for back-pressure routing, which generates copies of packets to artificially increase {{the length of}} a queue when the queue’s occupancy is low, which dramatically improves the delay performance of back-pressure under light load condition. The idea in [13] is somewhat similar to our work in this paper in terms of using artificially increasing the length of nodes’ queue lengths when calculating link weights. However, in [13], a packet’s duplicate copies in a queue need to be really transmitted. In contrast, the VBR algorithm in this paper only uses a <b>virtual</b> queue <b>length</b> (as a counter) for transmission scheduling decision-making and causes no extra packet to be transmitted.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{we design}} a new virtual queue-based {{back-pressure}} scheduling algorithm (VBR) for achieving significant delay reduction in {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSN). Our algorithm design comes from an observation that classical back-pressure scheduling algorithm usually needs {{a long period of}} time to form a queue backlog-based gradient in a network, which decreases towards the sink in the network, before achieving stable packet delivery performance. To address this issue, VBR is designed to pre-build proper virtual queue-based gradient at nodes in a WSN, which is chosen to be a function of traffic arrival rate, link rate, and distance to sink, in order to be adaptive to different network and application environments while achieving high network performance. Moreover, the queue backlog differential between each pair of neighbor nodes is decided by their actual queue lengths and also their <b>virtual</b> queue <b>lengths</b> (gradient values).
