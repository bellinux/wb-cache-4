5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension (IIH) {{is a condition}} characterized by increased intracranial pressure (pressure around the brain) without a detectable cause. The main symptoms are headache, vision problems, ringing in the ears with the heartbeat, and shoulder pain. Complications may include <b>vision</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hypertension (HTN or HT), {{also known}} as high blood {{pressure}} (HBP), is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms. Long-term high blood pressure, however, is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, <b>vision</b> <b>loss,</b> and chronic kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Pressure on {{the part}} of the optic nerve known as the chiasm, which is located above the gland, leads to loss of vision on the outer side of the visual field on both sides, as this {{corresponds}} to areas on the retinas supplied by these parts of the optic nerve; it is encountered in 75% of cases. Visual acuity is reduced in half, and over 60% have a visual field defect. The visual loss depends on which part of the nerve is affected. If the part of the nerve between the eye and the chiasm is compressed, the result is <b>vision</b> <b>loss</b> in one eye. If the part after the chiasm is affected, visual loss on one side of the visual field occurs.|$|E
25|$|Many {{solvents}} {{are known}} or suspected to be cataractogenic, greatly increasing {{the risk of}} developing cataracts in the lens of the eye. Solvent exposure has also been associated with neurotoxic damage causing hearing <b>loss</b> and color <b>vision</b> <b>losses.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractUsing {{the method}} of limits, we {{measured}} spatial and temporal vision in 15 patients, aged 4 – 28 years, who had been monocularly deprived of patterned visual input during infancy by a dense cataract. All patients showed losses in both spatial and temporal <b>vision,</b> with greater <b>losses</b> in spatial than in temporal <b>vision.</b> <b>Losses</b> were smaller when there had been more patching of the non-deprived eye.

40|$|We {{assessed}} chromatic {{discrimination in}} multiple sclerosis (MS) patients both with (ON) and without (no ON) {{a history of}} optic neuritis using the Cambridge color test (CCT). Our goal {{was to determine the}} magnitude and chromatic axes of any color <b>vision</b> <b>losses</b> in both patient groups, and to evaluate age-related changes in chromatic discrimination in both patient groups compared to normals. Using the CCT, we measured chromatic discrimination along the protan, deutan and tritan axes in 35 patients with MS (17 ON eyes) and 74 age matched controls. Color thresholds for both patient groups were significantly higher than controls` along the protan and tritan axes (P < 0. 001). In addition, the ON and no-ON groups differed significantly along all three-color axes (p < 0. 001). MS patients presented a progressive color discrimination impairment with age (along the deutan and tritan axes) that was almost two times faster than controls, {{even in the absence of}} ON. These findings suggest that demyelinating diseases reduce sensitivity to color vision in both red-green and blue-yellow axes, implying impairment in both parvocellular and koniocellular visual pathways. The CCT is a useful tool to help characterize <b>vision</b> <b>losses</b> in MS and the relationship between these losses and degree of optic nerve involvement...|$|R

25|$|Glaucoma is a {{group of}} eye {{diseases}} which result in damage to the optic nerve and <b>vision</b> <b>loss.</b> The most common type is open-angle glaucoma with less common types including closed-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly over time and there is no pain. Side vision may begin to decrease followed by central vision resulting in blindness if not treated. Closed-angle glaucoma can present gradually or suddenly. The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, and nausea. <b>Vision</b> <b>loss</b> from glaucoma, once it has occurred, is permanent.|$|E
25|$|Another popular {{technique}} is electro-physiologic testing using visual evoked (cortical) potentials (VEPs or VECPs), {{which can be}} used to estimate visual acuity in doubtful cases and expected severe <b>vision</b> <b>loss</b> cases like Leber's congenital amaurosis.|$|E

50|$|Retinal {{degeneration}} is {{the deterioration}} of the retina caused by the progressive and eventual death of the cells of the retina. There are several reasons for retinal degeneration, including artery or vein occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, R.L.F./R.O.P. (retrolental fibroplasia/ retinopathy of prematurity), or disease (usually hereditary). These may present in many different ways such as impaired vision, night blindness, retinal detachment, light sensitivity, tunnel <b>vision,</b> and <b>loss</b> of peripheral <b>vision</b> to total <b>loss</b> of <b>vision.</b> Of the retinal degenerative diseases retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a very important example.|$|R
25|$|In {{treating}} advanced diabetic retinopathy, the burns {{are used}} to destroy the abnormal blood vessels that form in the retina. This {{has been shown to}} reduce the risk of severe <b>vision</b> <b>loss</b> for eyes at risk by 50%.|$|E
25|$|Sleepiness (12.5%), {{headache}} (3.8%), dizziness (3.8%), nervousness (2.7%), depression (2.5%), memory disturbances (2.3%), diplopia (2.2%), aggression (2.0%), ataxia (1.9%), vertigo (1.9%), hyperactivity (1.8%), <b>vision</b> <b>loss</b> (1.6%) (See below), confusion (1.4%), insomnia (1.3%), impaired concentration (1.2%), personality issues (1.1%). Out of 299 children, 33 (11%) became hyperactive.|$|E
25|$|If an {{infected}} person survives, recovery may be quick and complete. Prolonged cases are often {{complicated by the}} occurrence of long-term problems, such as inflammation of the testicles, joint pains, muscular pain, skin peeling, or hair loss.

40|$|These {{guidelines}} {{address the}} need for valid and reliable measures to aid in making decisions on teaching of braille and/or print to students with moderate to severe <b>vision</b> <b>losses.</b> After an introductory section, section 1 presents basic principles organized into the following categories: (1) learning media, (2) students who use the learning media, (3) selection of learning medium/media, and (4) use of learning media in educational settings. Section 2 addresses assessment and evaluation, detailing both individual child attributes to be measured and educational and noneducational environmental attributes to be measured. Section 3 presents 16 guidelines for decision making in selection of learning media. These include: low vision children must have annual low vision evaluations; some children show definite preferences for either visual or tactual learning at an early age; some low vision students may utilize both braille and print for selected purposes; keyboardin...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{evaluate}} achromatic and chromatic vision of workers chronically exposed to organic solvents through psychophysical methods. Thirty-one gas station workers (31. 5 ± 8. 4 years old) were evaluated. Psychophysical tests were achromatic tests (Snellen chart, spatial and temporal contrast sensitivity, and visual perimetry) and chromatic tests (Ishihara's test, color discrimination ellipses, and Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test—FM 100). Spatial contrast sensitivities of exposed workers were lower than the control at spatial frequencies of 20 and 30 cpd whilst the temporal contrast sensitivity was preserved. Visual field losses were found in 10 – 30 degrees of eccentricity in the solvent exposed workers. The exposed workers group had higher error values of FM 100 and wider color discrimination ellipses area compared to the controls. Workers occupationally exposed to organic solvents had abnormal visual functions, mainly color <b>vision</b> <b>losses</b> and visual field constriction...|$|R

25|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} {{often has}} no early warning signs. Even macular edema, {{which can cause}} rapid <b>vision</b> <b>loss,</b> may not have any warning signs for some time. In general, however, a person with macular edema {{is likely to have}} blurred vision, making it hard to do things like read or drive. In some cases, the vision will get better or worse during the day.|$|E
25|$|Age {{can result}} in visual impairment, whereby non-verbal {{communication}} is reduced, {{which can lead to}} isolation and possible depression. Macular degeneration causes <b>vision</b> <b>loss</b> and increases with age, affecting nearly 12% of those above the age of 80. This degeneration is caused by systemic changes in the circulation of waste products and by growth of abnormal vessels around the retina.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} major {{treatments}} for diabetic retinopathy, {{which are very}} effective in reducing <b>vision</b> <b>loss</b> from this disease. In fact, even people with advanced retinopathy have a 95 percent chance of keeping their vision when they get treatment before the retina is severely damaged. These three treatments are laser surgery, injection of corticosteroids or anti-VEGF agents into the eye, and vitrectomy.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: we {{have tested}} the {{hypothesis}} that the co-occurrence of common impairments (motor and cognitive impairments, <b>vision</b> and hearing <b>loss,</b> depressive symptoms) of later life have exacerbating effects on disability [activities and instrumental activities of daily living, social and role function, (in) activity]. Method: data were drawn from a community-based sample of 624 people aged 57 and older. Results: motor impairments and depressive symptoms were associated with all disability measures, even when the effects of other impairments, age and gender were controlled. This indicates independent, predominant effects of motor impairments and depressive symptoms. Although several significant first-order interaction effects (indicating exacerbation) of impairments on disability were found, they were not very strong, but <b>vision</b> and hearing <b>losses</b> exacerbate the impact of the other impairments on disability. Conclusions: impairments, particularly motor impairments and depressive symptoms, largely act 'solo', by main effects on disability. Only a few combinations including <b>vision</b> or hearing <b>loss</b> further exacerbate the effects of other impairments on disability...|$|R
