40|$|The neighbourhoods, which {{create the}} very fabric of cities, are incomprehensibly {{changing}} by forces {{far out of}} the control of many residents. The vital connections to their communities, which can ensure a sustainable vitality across generations, are being broken by the effects of intensification, and by the ebb‐and‐flow of resident migration and commercial development. Our children can renew our connections to our cities, first by getting to know their own neighbourhoods, then by reaching out to fellow communities across the city. By offering our children a mechanism to explore how their urban environs are changing, they themselves can become experts on their local community with a genuine voice. The cultural importance of storytelling and play are finding their way back as rediscovered learning tools. Legends, myths, campfire lore, secrets between friends – these are the stories which leave their greatest impact on how we understand our ever‐changing world, and how we begin to see our place in it. This research seeks ways to engage our young citizens to weigh alternate urban visions and to share their understandings through shared stories found in urban play – explore its sidewalks, buildings, walls, trees and people, and then share, in their own way, a collective <b>voice</b> of <b>guidance...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Our {{objective}} {{of this study is}} the develop-ment of the navigation system which is used in the indoor space(eg. underground shopping mall, hospital, etc.) and supports activities of the visually impaired without help of others. This system is composed of optical beacons which are set on the ceiling and emit the position code as infrared signal, an optical receiver which receives sig-nal from beacons, and a navigator which guides a user by articial voice. Three subjects with low vision werer tested in the hos-pital with our navigation system. 49 optical beacons were set on the ceiling, and the subject equipped with an op-tical receiver and a navigator. Each subject walked from the start point to the destination following the <b>guidance</b> <b>voice.</b> From these experiment, the following character-istics became clear. 1) On a pathway where a subject can feel the wall, every subjects could follow the naviga-tion voice. 2) Some subjects couldn't go across the wide pathway straight, and then the system lost their position. Therefore, if the problem of crossing the pathway is im-proved, our navigation system will be a very valuable one to support activities of the visually impaired.

40|$|Automation {{becomes more}} {{significant}} on increasing effectiveness and efficiency. Therefore, to provide better facilities, hotels take {{a turn for}} automation. For that reason, an automation system on giving service by hotels for receiving and sending a certain message in a certain moment to the guest, has been designed. The guest {{will be in charge}} with the Interactive Voice Response system through the telephone line to receive messages. The recorded voice messages will guide the guest to enter necessary data to form the message such as room number, date, time and kind of message. The automation system is designed in Delphi 3. 0 using Sound Card. The <b>guidance</b> <b>voice</b> is pre-recorded messages. The services provided are Wake Up Call and Personal Reminder. The hardware involved in the system are on/off hook, ring detector, tone detector and DTMF decoder, while the software are DTMF encoder and the controller system. The conclusion shows that system enables computer functions as the receiver and message deliverer automatically without operator interference. Unfortunately, the telephone voice recording has a noise that is caused by the sidetone effect of the line. Furthermore, this interactive voice system can be equipped with voice recognition and speech synthesizer instead of using stored speech, as done in this final project...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} current {{features}} {{of state and}} proprietary traveler information applications, elements of good design and usability, human factors issues regarding visual and cognitive distraction, and makes recommendations {{for the next generation}} of Minnesota’s traveler information application, MN 511. Traveler information systems were created to serve drivers by providing accurate information about traffic and road conditions before drivers began their trip. The advancement of cellular telephones provided a new opportunity for drivers to access traffic and road information en-route, but introduced considerable cognitive distraction on drivers navigating the complex phone trees. The evolution of traveler information systems onto smartphone applications has eased the cognitive demand previously imposed by phone tree systems, but has shifted the demand to drivers’ visual resources. The dichotomy between state-funded 511 travel information applications and proprietary traveler information applications is primarily determined by the features each contains. The common features included in the current proprietary traveler information applications provide insight into the opportunities for future iterations of MN 511 mobile applications. The MN 511 application can continue to improve by incorporating select features from proprietary applications, such as <b>voice</b> commands, route <b>guidance,</b> saved places, and travel time estimates, while taking into account cognitive workload and visual distraction. This is important because publicly funded traveler information applications have a greater responsibility, compared to proprietary applications, to account for distraction and ensure the safety of its users...|$|R

40|$|Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) {{are getting}} more {{popularity}} due to the potential Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) technology. It provides many efficient network services such as safety warnings (collision warning), entertainment (video and <b>voice),</b> maps based <b>guidance,</b> and emergency information. VANETs most commonly use Road Side Units (RSUs) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V 2 V) referred to as Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V 2 I) mode for data accessing. IEEE 802. 11 p standard which was originally designed for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) is modified to address such type of communication. However, IEEE 802. 11 p uses Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) for communication between wireless nodes. Therefore, it does not perform well for high mobility networks such as VANETs. Moreover, in RSU mode timely provision of data/services under high density of vehicles is challenging. In this paper, we propose a RSU-based efficient channel access scheme for VANETs under high traffic and mobility. In the proposed scheme, the contention window is dynamically varied according to the times (deadlines) the vehicles {{are going to leave}} the RSU range. The vehicles with shorter time deadlines are served first and vice versa. Simulation is performed by using the Network Simulator (NS- 3) v. 3. 6.

Methods: An observational and documental study for which were selected sound sources presenting musical genres and styles {{that are part of}} the experience of the researchers, which were analyzed considering origins, formative elements and vocal features. Alongside we carried out a review of literature grounded in databases research and free review of websites and classical books of the area. Results: The selected styles (Rock and Roll, Heavy Metal, Trash Metal, Grunge, Gothic Metal, Rap, Funk, Blues, R&B – Rhythm and Blues, Soul, Gospel, MPB, Samba, Forro, Sertanejo, Bossa Nova, Opera and Chamber Music) were described, pointing the reasons for the speech therapist to be informed about them and about singing <b>voice</b> aspects. His <b>guidance</b> may minimize possible vocal damage caused by each style, since each of them carries its own patterns to which the interpreter must submit. Conclusions: We conclude that the singer will use a specific vocal pattern that resembles the musical style he intends to sing, regardless of any harm it may or may not cause to vocal health. When choosing a musical style, it is important that the singer has the knowledge and understanding of how the use of his vocal apparatus will cause or not cause injury to his voice.

40|$|Most {{people are}} not {{familiar}} with the indoor environment because most interior spaces are similar, and as such do not arouse the interest of most visitors. Although the GPS combined with the GIS has been broadly applied to many navigation applications, it might be still insufficient in an indoor environment where GPS signals are often severely obstructed. To meet the indoor requirements, the technique of RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) was utilized to play an important locating role in the implementation of an indoor guidance system. The RFID tags, containing 1 KB capacity divided by 64 blocks, were adopted to accommodate the spatial-related information for working with the shortest routing for the system. By selecting the start and end points in the operation, the guidance system can suggest a direct, shortest distance, path. The locations of the passing points were identified and obtained by retrieving the spatial-related data from the tags next to the moving RFID reader. The guidance messages, including suggested path, modified path and moving directions, can be immediately presented to the users and arrive at their destination via the system’s graphic and <b>voice</b> interfaces. This <b>guidance</b> system has been comprehensively tested for its operation functions and was evaluated by a group of users, indicating that the average time for way finding in an indoor guidance trial can be efficiently reduced by 50 %. This prototype for an indoor guidance system is expected to be capable of working on a portable device, such as a PDA or mobile phone, thereby extending its practical application...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there has}} been {{considerable}} research on in-vehicle navigation systems, many safety and usability problems re-occur in system after system, even in systems that {{have been subjected to}} some sort of safety or human factors evaluation. This paper describes those problems and a test protocol to identify them. Common problems were identified from detailed evaluations of four contemporary navigation systems. Those problems, described in layman’s terms, were found both with destination entry and route guidance. Destination entry problems were associated with (1) the layout and labeling of the control and menus, (2) audio and visual feedback, and (3) order of entry of the destination information. Route guidance problems were most commonly associated with (1) starting guidance and ending, (2) display design and readability, (3) <b>voice</b> <b>guidance</b> and timing, and (4) rerouting. The test protocol, developed as {{part of the process of}} evaluating the four systems, consists of two parts. The first part concentrates on the control layout, destination entry, and other tasks performed while the vehicle is parked.
