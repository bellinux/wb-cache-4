50|$|The {{discount}} for voluntary repayments of a pre-2005 HECS {{debt was}} reduced from 15% to 10% from 1 January 2005. On 1 January 2012, the <b>voluntary</b> <b>repayment</b> discount {{was reduced to}} 5%, and was removed completely from 1 January 2017.|$|E
50|$|HELP account debtors {{can make}} {{voluntary}} repayments. These repayments attract a 5% bonus (reduced from 10% from January 2012) for repayments over $500. If the remaining debt {{is less than}} $500 the bonus still applies on repayment of their balance of the debt. As making voluntary repayments does not exempt the person from compulsory repayments, if the person intends {{to pay off the}} total debt voluntarily, it is financially advantageous for them to do it before lodging the tax return. This will attract the 5% bonus on the repayment, {{and there would be no}} balance on the debt to which the compulsory repayment provisions can apply. Better still, if the <b>voluntary</b> <b>repayment</b> is made before the indexation date of 1 June, the avoiding of the indexation adjustment is an additional bonus. Even factoring in the 5% bonus on voluntary repayments, many people elect not to pay off their debt in advance of the required repayments because it still works out to be one of the cheapest loans most people will ever receive. As of 1 January 2017 the Commonwealth Government removed the 5% <b>voluntary</b> <b>repayment</b> bonus on all HELP debt repayments.|$|E
5000|$|From 1 April 2013, the {{repayment}} rate for student loan deductions increased from 10% to 12% and the <b>voluntary</b> <b>repayment</b> bonus was abolished. (Student allowances were also restricted {{to four years}} worth of study.) The changes which came into effect in 2013 were introduced because the Government said it wanted to shift its investment from student support to supporting universities. The changes were criticised by Labour Party Tertiary Education Spokesperson, Grant Robertson, who said they would [...] "dampen demand" [...] for tertiary education and drive graduates overseas.|$|E
50|$|The Trust is {{well known}} for its {{efficient}} administration: although the Trust gives £2 million a year to several hundred beneficiaries, it does so with only two full-time and three part-time employees. The Trust also enjoys many <b>voluntary</b> <b>repayments</b> by beneficiaries (mainly through legacies) which go towards the Trust's general fund - in 2004-5, these repayments amounted to £134,850.|$|R
2500|$|Since most claims {{revolved}} around MP's second homes in London, a panel {{was established to}} investigate all claims relating to the [...] "second homes" [...] allowance between 2004 and 2008. Headed by former civil servant Sir Thomas Legg, the panel published its findings on 12 October as MPs returned to Westminster following the summer recess. Each MP received a letter stating {{whether or not he}} or she would be required to repay any expenses claimed. Details of <b>voluntary</b> <b>repayments</b> by MPs amounting to almost £500,000 were also officially published.|$|R
50|$|From 1 April 2009, <b>voluntary</b> {{student loan}} <b>repayments</b> above $500 in a tax year were awarded at 10% bonus.|$|R
50|$|HELP debts do not attract {{interest}} (in {{the normal}} sense), but are instead indexed to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on 1 June each year, {{based on the}} annual CPI to March of that year. The indexation rate applied on 1 June 2006 was 2.8% and 3.4% on 1 June 2007. Indexation applies to {{the part of the}} debt that has been unpaid for 11 months or more. Thus, indexation is calculated on the opening HELP debt balance on 1 July of the previous year plus any debt incurred {{in the first half of}} the current year (usually for first semester courses) less any compulsory and <b>voluntary</b> <b>repayments,</b> with bonus. Any HELP debt incurred on second semester courses (usually determined in June) will not be subject to indexation until the next year. After indexation, the new balance is rounded down to a whole dollar amount.|$|R
40|$|The rate-of-return-dominance puzzle asks why low-return assets, like fiat money, {{are used}} in actual economies given that risk-free higher-return assets are available. As long as this {{question}} remains unresolved, most conclusions from monetary models which arbitrarily restrict the marketability properties of alternative assets to make money valuable are difficult to assess. In this paper, I provide a framework in which fiat money has value in equilibrium, even though a higher-return asset is available and there are neither restrictions nor transaction costs in using it. I suggest {{that the use of}} money is associated with frictions underlying debt contracts. In an environment where full enforcement is not feasible, the actual rate of return on assets is determined by incentives eliciting <b>voluntary</b> debt <b>repayment.</b> I show that the inflation rate or, more generally, the depreciation rate of an asset in which debts are denominated may function as a commitment device. As a result, money is used in equilibrium and the optimal inflation rate is positive. Money, Inflation, Debt Enforcement, Banking. ...|$|R
