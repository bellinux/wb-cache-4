40|$|In this paper, a novel {{resin-based}} crystallisation {{method was}} developed for the recovery of succinic acid (SA) crystals from fermentation broths (FB) using Actinobacillus succinogenes. Direct crystallisation of synthetic fermentation broths was firstly investigated and {{the results indicated that}} the synthetic fermentation broth consisting of a mixture of organic acids (in the free acid form rather than in the salt form) could significantly benefit in succinic acid recovery. Therefore, a commercially available cation-exchange resin Amberlite IR 120 H was employed to convert the fermentation end-products such as succinate, formate, acetate and pyruvate from the salt form into the free acid form. Then, succinic acid was selectively separated from the acid mixture by vacuum evaporation and crystallisation. Highly purified SA crystals were successfully recovered from both synthetic and real fermentation broths using this method. A higher SA crystal purity (99 %) and yield (89. 5 %) were obtained in the direct crystallisation method using an ion-exchange resin as compared to the direct acid addition method (46 % and 35 %, respectively). The work presented here sets the stage for the development of an efficient resin-based <b>vacuum-distillation</b> and crystallisation system for the recovery of succinic acid crystals from fermentation broths...|$|E

If you are the author please contact PEARL Admin (pearladmin@plymouth. ac. uk) to discuss options. The gas chromatograms of crude oil hydrocarbons reveal both resolved and unresolved components. The unresolved feature is {{commonly referred to as}} the unresolved complex mixture (UCM). UCMs are thought to result from the co-elution of complex mixtures of hydrocarbons with similar chemical properties and become more obvious as resolved components are removed by processes such as weathering and refining. Consequently UCMs are a prominent feature in oil-polluted sediments, biodegraded crudes and refineiT products. The characterisation of both aliphatic and aromatic unresolved complex mixtures (UCMs) of hydrocarbons, as well as their possible effects on the environment, is described. An aliphatic hydrocarbon UCM isolated from the base oil of Silkolene 150 lubricating oil was characterised by a combination of micro <b>vacuum-distillation</b> and oxidative degradation. <b>Vacuum-distillation</b> produced six distillate cuts and a residue which were all highly unresolved by GC (ca. 951 / 6). The average molecular weight of each cut was determined by probe CIMS (310 - 440 Daltons), and varied by - 20 Daltons. Cr 03 oxidation of each fraction yielded similar distributions of n-monocarboxylic acids, ketones and lactones as well as C 02 (ca. 6 %). The resolved products of oxidation suggest that the aliphatic UCM is a rather homogeneous mixture of highly branched alkanes. However a significant amount of the products remain unresolved (UCMox.; ca. 70 - 95 %). A retro -structural analysis approach, using an aromatic UCM oxidant (Ru 04), combined with a mass balance approach, was used to characterise aromatic UCMs. Following reproducibility studies and the analysis of authentic aromatic compounds, the method was applied to the characterisation of unresolved aromatic refinery oil fractions and a suite of aromatic UCM distillate fractions. Selected refinery oils were separated into mono-, di-, tri- and tetraaromatics by BPLC and shown to be mainly unresolved by GC (ca. 80 %). Ru 04 oxidation of these fractions yielded DCM soluble products (24 - 74 %), water soluble products (0 - 10 %) and C 02 (12 - 78 %). The principal resolved products in each oxidation were monocarboxylic acids and dicarboxylic acids which were used to reconstruct precursor compounds. <b>Vacuum-distillation</b> of Tia Juana Pesado crude (Venezuela) gave six cuts and a residue which were analysed by GC, 1 H NMP, UV and probe CIMS to obtain molecular weight (171 - 301 Daltons) and broad structural information whilst Ru 04 oxidation was used to obtain molecular information via the retro -structural analysis approach. This showed that the aromatic UCM was in fact highly aliphatic and contained alkyl and cycloalkyl tetralins. A significant advancement in the quantitative characterisation of UCMOx. and subsequently the characterisation of aromatic UCMs was made. Ion cyclotron resonance spectrometry (ICR) was used to characterise the Ru 04 oxidation products of selected refinery fractions. Analysis of the oxidation products of a monoaromatic refinery fraction indicated the presence of monocarboxylic acids (Cl - C 21; 58 %) and alicyclic carboxylic acids (C 7 - C 19; 16 %), a hydrogenated monoaromatic sample contained monocarboxylic acids (Cl - C 20; 30 %), dicarboxylic acids (C 2 - C 11, 7 %) and alicyclic carboxylic acids (C 7 - C 18; 11 %), whilst a diaromatic fraction contained monocarboxylic acids (C 10 - C 19; 7 %), alkyl phthalic acids (C 8 - C 17 ', 17 %) and cycloalkyl phthalic acids (C 11 - C 15; 3 %). Retro -structural analysis suggests that the nonhydrotreated monoaromatic UCM is mainly comprised of alicyclic and alkyl substituted benzenes, the monoaromatic UCM isolated from the hydrotreated oil of alky'l and cycloalkyl substituted tetralins and the diaromatic fraction of alkyl and cycloalkyl naphthalenes. This was supported by, FIMS analysis of the fractions prior to oxidation. As an investigation of the environmental toxicity of UCMs, the effect of a saturated aliphatic UCM, and its chemical oxidation products, on the feeding rate of mussels (Mytilus edulis), was investigated. The UCM had little effect, whilst oxidation resulted in an increase in toxicity. The non-toxic nature of the hydrocarbons was attributed to their low aqueous solubility, whilst oxidation resulted in the formation of products NNith a greater solubility, which were sufficiently hydrophobic to be narcotic toxicants.

Furthermore, unsaturated-zone pore water has significantly larger concentrations of major ions and dissolved solids than does the saturated-zone water. Recharge of perched or saturated-zone water, therefore, requires rapid flow through fractures or permeable regions in the unsaturated zone to avoid mixing with the chemically concentrated water in the unsaturated zone. This conceptual model is consistent with observations of rapidly moved post-bomb (post- 1954) tritium and chlorine- 36 in the deep unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain. Presence of post-bomb tritium in matrix water away from fracture zones further indicates that parts of the fast-flow water that moves through fractures have been diverted laterally into nonwelded units. Experimental data show that different lithologic units require specific water-extraction methods for stable-isotope analyses of hydrogen and oxygen to ensure accurate characterization. <b>Vacuum-distillation</b> and compression-extraction methods both can yield accurate data but must be used with specific lithologies. Column experiments demonstrate that percolating water can exchange with pore water of the core as well as water held in zeolite minerals in the core. Exchange rates range from days to months. Pore-water samples from core, therefore, reflect the most recently infiltrated water but do not reflect percolating water of the distant past...|$|E
