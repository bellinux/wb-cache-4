At that time jails were much neglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all public wrongdoing--and which is always its heaviest and longest punishment--was still far off. So felons were not lodged and fed better than soldiers, (to say nothing of paupers,) and seldom set fire to their prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup.

Now, if you'll believe me, she hasn't come out of that house since noon to- day. So not to give her up too easily, I was waiting about, a little last bit more, when I passed close to this good lass two or three times; and her face being so friendly I spoke to her, and she spoke to me.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} polling {{systems with}} an autonomous server that remain at a queue for an exponential {{amount of time}} before moving to a next queue incurring a generally distributed switch-over time. The server remains at a queue until the exponential <b>visit</b> <b>time</b> expires, also when the queue becomes empty. If the queue is not empty when the <b>visit</b> <b>time</b> expires, service is preempted upon server departure, and repeated when the server returns to the queue. The paper first presents a necessary and sufficient condition for stability, and subsequently analyzes the joint queue-length distribution via an embedded Markov chain approach. As the autonomous exponential <b>visit</b> <b>times</b> may seem {{to result in a}} system that closely resembles a system of independent queues, we explicitly investigate the approximation of our system via a system of independent vacation queues.

40|$|Abstract Background Longitudinal {{studies using}} data {{collected}} {{as part of}} usual care risk providing biased results if <b>visit</b> <b>times</b> {{are related to the}} outcome of interest. Statistical methods for mitigating this bias are available but rarely used. This lack of use could be attributed to a lack of need or to a lack of awareness of the issue. Methods We performed a systematic review of longitudinal studies that used data collected as part of patients’ usual care and were published in MEDLINE or EMBASE databases between January 2005 through May 13 th 2015. We asked whether the extent of and reasons for variability in <b>visit</b> <b>times</b> were reported on, and in cases where there was a need to account for informativeness of <b>visit</b> <b>times,</b> whether an appropriate method was used. Results Of 44 eligible articles, 57 % (n = 25) reported on the total follow-up time, 7 % (n = 3) on the gaps between visits, and 57 % (n = 25) on the number of visits per patient; 78 % (n = 34) reported on at least one of these. Two studies assessed predictors of <b>visit</b> <b>times,</b> and 86 % of studies did not report enough information to assess whether there was a need to account for informative follow-up. Only one study used a method designed to account for informative <b>visit</b> <b>times.</b> Conclusions The low proportion of studies reporting on whether there were important predictors of <b>visit</b> <b>times</b> suggests that researchers are unaware of the potential for bias when data is collected as part of usual care and <b>visit</b> <b>times</b> are irregular. Guidance on the potential for bias and on the reporting of longitudinal studies subject to irregular follow-up is needed...|$|R
30|$|In our OSFP data, {{each patient}} data consist of {{information}} at different hospital visits {{as demonstrated in}} Fig.  15. For example, patients p_ 1, p_ 2, and p_ 3 have <b>visited</b> 5 <b>times</b> each. However, the <b>visit</b> <b>times</b> of patients vary significantly. For example, all p_ 1 visits are from 2009 to 2012, while all p_ 2 visits are from 2013 to 2016. Thus, {{it will not be}} reasonable if we create snapshots by using the exact <b>visit</b> <b>times</b> since patients with the same OSA symptoms and severities may be referred at different times and different follow-up points. Hence, our medical expert suggests to use the relative <b>visit</b> <b>times.</b> Concretely, we treat the first visit of a patient as time 0 (time of diagnosis) and calculate the next <b>visits</b> by the <b>time</b> difference in months to the first one. By this way, we can capture the disease evolvements. Following the relative <b>visit</b> <b>times,</b> we create different snapshots after a specific <b>time</b> frame of <b>visits.</b> For example, in Fig.  15, we use 4 different snapshots after 0, 12, 24, and 36 months. Note that if a patient has several visits at a specific snapshot, we use the last visit to present the patient status at that snapshot.|$|R

40|$|Background and aims: Visit {{quality is}} a crucial {{component}} of patient-physician interaction that its inadequacy can negatively influence the diagnosis and treatment efficiency. The waiting <b>time</b> and <b>visit</b> length are important determinants of quality in the outpatient care setting. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to determine waiting <b>time</b> and <b>visit</b> length and to compare them before Implementation of health sector evolution in Iran. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted during autumn 2014. A sample of 540 patients who referred to the outpatient clinics of Sheikh Al Raeis of Tabriz Province (North West of Iran) were randomly selected and surveyed. Data were collected by the collection tools and analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. Results: The average <b>visit</b> <b>time</b> and standard deviation were 8. 52 min and 3. 14 respectively, which is significantly lower than the minimum average of 15 min approved by the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Educations (MOHME). Average of waiting time was 101. 57 min for patients. The result showed that <b>visit</b> <b>time</b> was shorter than standard (7. 5 min per patient) of health sector evolution in specialties of general Surgery, ophthalmologist, ENT, orthopedics and pediatrics. Also, the variables such as: number of visits, age of physicians, experience of physicians, men physicians, working shift of afternoon influenced on <b>visit</b> <b>time</b> significantly. Conclusions: The starting points of health care delivery to patients are consultations. This study showed that <b>visit</b> <b>time</b> is short and waiting time is very long.

40|$|Background: Patients with {{critical}} {{conditions would}} create an anxiety on their familes. It makes {{them want to}} always be beside the patient. <b>Visiting</b> <b>time</b> is the time given to the family {{to interact with the}} patient. Objective: To explore the family’s perceptiontoward the <b>visiting</b> <b>time</b> at the ICU. Methods: This was a descriptive qualitative research with four family members of the critical patients selected based on purposive sampling technique. The data were collected using in-depth interviews and analyzed using analytical techniques by Collaizi. Results: It was found 3 main themes: <b>visiting</b> <b>time,</b> functions of the <b>visiting</b> <b>time,</b> and family’s expectations during the <b>visiting</b> <b>time.</b> Most families said that the <b>visiting</b> <b>time</b> should be flexible, should adjust the patients’ conditions, {{they should be able to}} visit at anytime, there should be one family member that always beside the patient, and the visit time should not disrupt the patients’ rest period. During the <b>visiting</b> <b>time,</b> the family could provide support to the patients such as motivation, communication, touch and prayer.
