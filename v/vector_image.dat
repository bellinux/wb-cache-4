These include the 'behaviour' CSS property, which connects the HTML elements with JScript behaviours (known as HTML Components, HTC); HTML+TIME profile, which adds timing and media synchronization support to HTML documents (similar to the W3C XHTML+SMIL), and the VML vector graphics file format. However, all were rejected, {{at least in}} their original forms; VML was subsequently combined with PGML (proposed by Adobe and Sun), resulting in the W3C-approved SVG format, {{one of the few}} <b>vector</b> <b>image</b> formats being used on the web, which IE did not support until version 9.|$|E

40|$|Figure 1 : A scene using several vector textures {{with some}} closeups showing {{embossing}} and transparency. Vector graphics representations of images are resolution independent. Direct use of <b>vector</b> <b>images</b> for real-time texture mapping would be desirable to avoid sampling artifacts such as blurring common with raster <b>images.</b> Scalable <b>Vector</b> Graphics (SVG) files {{are typical of}} <b>vector</b> graphics <b>image</b> representations. Such representations composite images from layers of paths and strokes defined with lines, elliptical arcs, and quadratic and cubic parametric splines. High-quality texture mapping requires both random access and anisotropic antialiasing. For <b>vector</b> <b>images,</b> these goals {{can be achieved by}} computing the distance to the closest primitives from a sample point and then mapping this distance through a soft threshold function. Representing transparency masks in this way is especially useful, since vector mattes can be used to render complex curvilinear geometry as textures on simple geometric primitives. Unfortunately, computing the exact minimum distance to the parametric curves used in <b>vector</b> <b>images</b> is difficult. Previous work has used approximations, but an accurate minimum distance is desirable in order to enable wide strokes and special effects such as embossing. In this paper, a simple algorithm is presented that can efficiently and accurately compute the minimum distance to a parametric curve when the sample point is within its radius of curvature and the curve can be segmented into monotonic regions. This technique {{can be used in a}} GPU shader to render antialiased <b>vector</b> <b>images</b> exactly as defined by SVG files...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to create a}} set of {{illustrated}} tasks for teaching vector graphics in elementary schools.

The main outcome of these tasks are <b>vector</b> <b>images</b> with a file containing the assignments for individual tasks. In case of not finding an Inkscape tool corresponding to the Callisto tool, with which work the textbooks that are used to create the tasks in Inkscape, the work proposes a possibility of replacing the tool with a different one.

40|$|Introduction Two-dimensional strain {{analysis}} {{is a powerful}} analysis modality, however, clinical utilization has been limited by variability between different analysis systems and operators. We compared strain in adults and children using vendor-specific and vendor-independent software to evaluate variability. Methods One hundred and ten subjects (50 / 110 pediatric, 80 / 110 normal left ventricular function) had echocardiograms with a General Electric ultrasound scanner between September 2010 and January 2012. Left ventricular longitudinal strain was derived with EchoPAC (General Electric, v 10. 8. 1), a vendor-specific software, and Velocity <b>Vector</b> <b>Imaging</b> (Siemens, v 3. 5), which is vendor-independent. Three independent readers analyzed all the echocardiograms yielding 330 datasets. Results Mean left ventricular global longitudinal Lagrangian strain was − 18. 1 [*]±[*]SD 4. 4 % for EchoPAC and − 15. 3 [*]±[*]SD 4. 1 % for Velocity <b>Vector</b> <b>Imaging.</b> Velocity <b>Vector</b> <b>Imaging</b> yielded lower absolute global longitudinal Lagrangian strain by mean 2. 9 (±SD 2. 7, p[*] 3 – 5 strain points on repeat measurements.

40|$|Abstract <b>Vector</b> {{graphics}} <b>images</b> {{are composed}} of lists of discrete geometric shapes, such as circles, squares, and lines. Vector graphics is popular in illustration and graphic design. The generation of <b>vector</b> <b>images</b> by evolutionary computation techniques, however, has been given little attention. This paper uses genetic algorithms to evolve <b>vector</b> <b>images.</b> By restricting the numbers of primitives and colour schemes used, stylized interpretations of target images are produced. Automatic evolution involves measuring the pixel-by-pixel colour distance between a candidate and target image. The JNetic evolutionary vector graphics system is described. JNetic supports automatic and user-guided evolution, chromosome editing, and high-detail masks. The user can paint masks over areas of the target image, which {{will be used to}} reproduce the high-detail features within those areas. The system has been successfully used by the authors as a creative tool...|$|R
