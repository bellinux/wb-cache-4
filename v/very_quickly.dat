In 1894, another major flood occurred on the Willamette, and although it too caused huge damage, it was not as large as that of 1861.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{rarity of}} the {{syndrome}} itself, {{it is hard}} to determine whether certain additional diseases are actually part of the syndrome.

5|$|At {{the second}} board, expert {{witnesses}} suggested {{that what was}} observed was the venting, through the engine-room ventilators, of a violent—but not instantaneous—explosion or deflagration in the 4-inch magazines. The same deflagration would have collapsed the bulkhead separating the 4-inch and 15-inch magazines, resulting <b>very</b> <b>quickly</b> in a catastrophic explosion similar to those previously witnessed at Jutland. This theory was ultimately adopted by the board.|$|E
5|$|Darius {{therefore}} began {{raising a}} huge new army {{with which he}} meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. Darius then died while preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and <b>very</b> <b>quickly</b> restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece.|$|E
5|$|From the beginning, the studio's {{goal was}} to be able develop {{multiple}} projects simultaneously, and the decision led the company to expand <b>very</b> <b>quickly.</b> Soon after the development of The Sith Lords began the team expanded to 20 employees. As of July 2004 it had expanded to 27, with 18 from Black Isle, and others from Blizzard Entertainment, Electronic Arts, Taldren, Totally Games, Treyarch, and Troika.|$|E

5|$|The Mark 1 was {{to provide}} a {{computing}} resource within the university, to allow researchers to gain experience in the practical use of computers, but it <b>very</b> <b>quickly</b> also became a prototype on which the design of Ferranti's commercial version could be based. Development ceased at the end of 1949, and the machine was scrapped towards the end of 1950, replaced in February 1951 by a Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer.|$|E
5|$|The P. rebeli {{developmental}} rate shows great {{phenotypic plasticity}} (changing its developmental rate {{in response to}} changes in the environment), as it develops <b>very</b> <b>quickly</b> in the lab and in the Pyrenees and Southern Alps. Scientists hypothesize that this plasticity is due to warm conditions and more light exposure, which affects larval development. Abundant food resources are also thought to play a part in quickened development.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{used the}} basic {{design of the}} Cerberus-class breastwork {{monitors}} to reduce design and construction time. Their hulls were completed <b>very</b> <b>quickly,</b> but the pace of building reduced as the likelihood of their immediate use diminished. They were delivered to the Royal dockyards in 1872 and commissioned for fitting out, {{but a number of}} years elapsed before that process was completed as little sense of urgency remained.|$|E

50|$|The first planar {{transistors}} {{had much}} worse characteristics than alloy junction transistors of the period, {{but as they}} could be mass-produced and alloy junction transistors could not, they cost much less and the characteristics of planar transistors improved <b>very</b> rapidly, <b>quickly</b> exceeding those of all earlier transistors and making earlier transistors obsolete.|$|R
5|$|The work {{begins with}} a sinfonia and then {{alternates}} choral movements and arias. There are no recitatives, no da capo repeats, {{and there is no}} chorale tune, unusually for Bach's cantatas. Bach makes extensive use of choral fugues and imitative polyphony, often shifting the tempo and character of the music within movements <b>very</b> <b>quickly</b> to accommodate a new musical idea with each successive phrase of text.|$|E
5|$|Those {{still on}} board Gothenburg tried {{to cling to}} the rigging, but {{throughout}} the early morning of 25 February, several more people were drowned after they were swept overboard by large broadside waves. Many passengers associated with the gold diggings were unwilling {{to let go of}} their gold and money belts, as it was probably their life savings; these individuals insisted on keeping them tied and once overboard reportedly drowned <b>very</b> <b>quickly.</b>|$|E
5|$|When hunting a {{web spider}} in the prey's web, a P. schultzi walks very slowly towards the prey and then, when {{two to three}} {{centimetres}} away, pauses for some minutes. During this time the P. schultzi quivers <b>very</b> <b>quickly</b> with its whole body at regular intervals. In almost all cases the prey stays motionless. P. schultzi never plucks the web as Portia fimbriata does.|$|E

This was fueled primarily by the combination of pitching and defense.|$|R
5|$|Although thin, these {{outer layers}} {{determine}} the thermal {{evolution of the}} white dwarf. The degenerate electrons in the bulk of a white dwarf conduct heat well. Most of a white dwarf's mass is therefore at almost the same temperature (isothermal), {{and it is also}} hot: a white dwarf with surface temperature between 8,000K and 16,000K will have a core temperature between approximately 5,000,000K and 20,000,000K. The white dwarf is kept from cooling <b>very</b> <b>quickly</b> only by its outer layers' opacity to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Argasid ticks, unlike ixodid ticks, may {{go through}} {{up to seven}} nymphal stages (instars), {{requiring}} a meal of blood each time. Their life cycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs {{over the course of}} her lifetime. Larvae feed <b>very</b> <b>quickly</b> and detach to molt into nymphs. Both male and female adults feed on blood, and they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process which is unique to argasid ticks.|$|E
5|$|At {{least in}} some species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are well below adult size, and adults produce eggs and sperm {{for as long as}} they have sufficient food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing eggs and sperm, and then shrink in size. When the food supply improves, they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction. These features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations <b>very</b> <b>quickly.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bellomont sailed for New York in late 1697, {{accompanied}} by his wife and her cousin, John Nanfan, who had been appointed Lieutenant Governor of New York. The voyage was exceptionally stormy, and Bellomont's ship was blown well south, eventually putting into Barbados before continuing on to New York. He arrived in New York City on 2 April 1698. Bellomont's stylish dress, good looks, and positive relationship with the king predisposed New Yorkers to like him, but he <b>very</b> <b>quickly</b> ran into difficulties and began making enemies.|$|E
5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between {{the top of the}} cargo and the top of the hold. Cargo is then free to move {{from one side of the}} ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker <b>very</b> <b>quickly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high {{velocity}} in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move <b>very</b> <b>quickly,</b> {{they need to be}} video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved to walk {{on the surface of the}} water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E
