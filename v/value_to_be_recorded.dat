We focus on the use of earnouts following changes to the accounting treatment of contingent consideration following the 2008 introduction of SFAS 141 (R). The revised standards require earnout fair <b>value</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> at acquisition date, while earnouts under the previous standards were only reported if, and when, they were paid. Our results indicate that earnout usage decreases in response to increased financial reporting costs of contingent liabilities. This decrease is strongest among financially constrained bidders, who are also observed to decrease participation in M&A markets. A Heckman probit model is employed to correct for sample selection bias. The implications of these findings for deal design and success are discussed...|$|E

The results of the tests (glucose <b>values)</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> in a logbook and brought to the physician.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRange image {{acquisition}} {{can be defined}} as the process of determining the physical distance from a given observation point to all points of consideration in a three-dimensional (3 D) surface object. The technology of range finders has been used for many years in military and airborne remote sensing survey applications. This paper suggests the use of computer databases (instead of mathematical formulas) for modeling 3 D surfaces. The basic concept is the proper selection of representative samples from the measured range <b>values</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>records</b> in the model database. The main contribution in this paper is developing an Intelligent Database Management System (IDMS) used for selecting samples and giving depth prediction at a given space point. The IDMS performs standard database operations such as adding, updating and deleting records in order to minimize the data storage memory size and prediction error. Search for specific data which are not previously stored in the database is impossible in classical database management systems (DMS) ...|$|R

I propose a new investigation of gain and NF at different EDFA configurations. Configurations such as SPSS, DPSS, DPSSF, TPDS, TPDSF, and QPDSF are designed, investigated and compared. A continuous progress of gain values is observed from SPSS to QPDSF, and a change of NF <b>values</b> related <b>to</b> configurations <b>is</b> <b>recorded.</b> The NF variations show different behaviors at different configurations.

[...] A manor house—likely <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> a simple timber-framed structure—would have existed at this time, but no trace survives. [...] The manor was held by the Episcopal See at Selsey, then by the Bishop of Chichester after the See transferred there in 1075. [...] The Domesday survey calculated the manor's <b>value</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> £25, and <b>recorded</b> 12 ploughs (a team of eight oxen), a church, the manor house and a mill of unspecified type. [...] A parish population of about 50 is suggested by the existence of 12 ploughs. [...] The present St Peter's Church, built in the mid-13th century, stands on the site of two earlier churches.|$|R
40|$|During early lactation, {{various studies}} have {{demonstrated}} a substantial change in the endocrinological-metabolic profile. The aim of this research <b>was</b> <b>to</b> study {{the characteristics of the}} pulsatile liberation of LH (luteinizing hormone) using a new mathematical approach in Simmental cows during the dry period and the early stage of lactation. Blood samples (every 10 min for 12 h) from 5 mature Simmental cows were collected every 7 - 10 days before calving until 130 days post-partum. The plasma were analyzed for their concentrations of LH. To confirm post-partum negative energy balance, NEFA (non esterified fatty acids) and IGF-I (insulin-like growth factor-I) were determined in the plasma while progesterone was evaluated in the milk whey to characterize when the cyclic ovaric activity restarted. A detailed statistical analysis was performed in order to check the normality of the distribution of LH concentrations, the definition and randomness of the spikes and the existence of periodicity. In conclusion, it is clear that a correct definition of the LH spike can only be achieved by a determination of the distribution of values that permits the statistical definition of outlying values by comparison with the frequency density histogram. To have a good distribution histogram, a large number of LH <b>values</b> need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> over a long period. In any case, the theoritical form of the distribution could not be determined and it appears that it does not belong to a ny of the classical distributions. Therefore this point will require supplementary studies...|$|R

Tendo por objetivo {{investigar}} paradigmas que nortearam a criação e habitabilidade de cidades em diferentes lugares e períodos históricos, pressupõe que uma reflexão sobre esses paradigmas, ainda que breve, fornecerá algum subsídio para uma leitura da cidade contemporânea e da crise que atravessa. Nesse intuito, propõe o cotejamento de textos históricos e míticos, atribuindo igual valor ao que se tem registrado sobre a gênese das cidades, à luz dos estudos culturais. Destacam-se a presença da morte e a maneira como propiciou o desejo de união dos grupos. Nesse contexto, diferentes religiões incidiram como laço e lastro do espaço público, condição necessária para a manutenção da ética. Exerceram seu papel de religar vivos e mortos, a realidade natural e a sobrenatural, mesmo quando manipuladas em busca de poder. Isso se dá, de diferentes maneiras, até o século XIX, quando cedem lugar a outras instituições e novos pressupostos. No século XXI, assistimos a uma crise das cidades, o que, se bem valiado, pode propiciar a construção de outros paradigmas, em consonância com as aspirações contemporâneas. Palavras-chave: Cidade; Morte; Religião. ABSTRACT This {{article presents}} {{a reading of}} the relation between the city, death and some of the religions that presided over or consolidated the development of cities. Aiming at investigating the paradigms that oriented the creation and viability of cities in various places and historical periods, it assumes that a reflection on those paradigms, however brief, can provide subsidies for {{a reading of the}} contemporary city and the crisis it is facing. In that sense, it focuses on historical and mythical texts, attributing equal <b>value</b> <b>to</b> what <b>is</b> <b>recorded</b> concerning the genesis of cities, in the light of cultural studies. Emphasis <b>is</b> given <b>to</b> the presence of death and the way it propitiated an urge for union in groups. In that context, different religions were the bonds and the reservoir of public space, a necessary condition to preserve ethics. They played the role of re-connecting the living and the dead, natural and supernatural reality, even when they were manipulated in the search for power. This happened, in different ways, until the 19 th century, when new institutions and presuppositions emerged. In the 21 st century, we witness a crisis in the cities, which, if properly assessed, may lead to the construction of other paradigms, in harmony with contemporary expectations. Key words: City; Death; Religion. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Although FAS 157 {{does not}} require fair <b>value</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used on any new classes of assets, it does apply to assets and {{liabilities}} that <b>are</b> <b>recorded</b> at fair value in accordance with other applicable rules. The accounting rules for which assets and liabilities are held at fair value are complex. Mutual funds and securities companies have recorded assets and some liabilities at fair value for decades in accordance with securities regulations and other accounting guidance. For commercial banks {{and other types of}} financial services companies, some asset classes <b>are</b> required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> at fair <b>value,</b> such as derivatives and marketable equity securities. For other types of assets, such as loan receivables and debt securities, it depends on whether the assets are held for trading (active buying and selling) or for investment. All trading assets <b>are</b> <b>recorded</b> at fair value. Loans and debt securities that are held for investment or <b>to</b> maturity <b>are</b> <b>recorded</b> at amortized cost, unless they <b>are</b> deemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> impaired (in which case, a loss is recognized). However, if they are available for sale or held for sale, they <b>are</b> required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> at fair <b>value</b> or the lower of cost or fair value, respectively. (FAS 65 and FAS 114 cover the accounting for loans, and FAS 115 covers the accounting for securities.) Notwithstanding the above, companies <b>are</b> permitted <b>to</b> account for almost any financial instrument at fair value, which they might elect to do in lieu of historical cost accounting (see FAS 159, [...] "The Fair Value Option").|$|R
