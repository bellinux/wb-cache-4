40|$|This study investigates how two experiments, held by UU-København, in {{cooperation}} with Uddannelseslaboratoriet, can increase the intake and reduce the dropout rate of the <b>vocational</b> <b>educations,</b> by using nudging. Furthermore it discusses which ethical and democratic challenges {{that the use of}} nudging entails. The investigation uses quantitative investigations of the youth educations in Denmark, as well as qualitative interviews of the student councilors in Copenhagen municipality. The study finds that the <b>vocational</b> <b>educations</b> are seen as an inferior youth education in comparison to the Danish high schools, because the students lack information. The experiments can reduce the asymmetric information between the <b>vocational</b> <b>educations,</b> the student counselors, the parents and the students. This can be done through different initiatives in the council practice. Nudging brings with it a risk of manipulation and using nudging must entail that it is transparent so that the person being nudged can identify how one has been influenced...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Clinton made {{reform of the}} Arkansas {{education}} system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was also an attorney {{as well as the}} chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, <b>vocational</b> <b>education,</b> higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session—the longest in Arkansas history. Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).|$|E
5|$|Many of Khrushchev's {{innovations}} {{were reversed}} after his fall.

His <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> program {{for high school students}} was also dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended. However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures, which lacked elevators or balconies. He began to change the economic base of the country, away from heavy industry beginning light, consumer industries.
