5|$|The {{defenders}} {{expected the}} German and Ottoman attack {{to be one}} of containment against their prepared line of defence, and an all-out attack on the right south of Katib Gannit. They also appreciated that such an attack would expose the German and Ottoman left flank. Murray's plan was to firstly delay the attackers and make it <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to gain ground south of Katib Gannit, and secondly, only when the German and Ottoman force was totally committed, to then disorganise their flank attack with an attack by Section Troops at Hill 70 and Dueidar, with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the Mobile Column operating more widely against the flank and rear.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{the wreck}} could not {{determine}} whether the escape hatch was workable from the inside. Analysts theorise that the men may have rejected risking the escape hatch {{even if it were}} operable, and would have preferred to wait for a submarine rescue ship to attach itself to the hatch. The sub was relatively close to shore {{and in the middle of}} a large naval exercise. The sailors had every reason to believe that rescue would arrive quickly. Using the escape trunk was risky. The sailors were in a compartment that was initially at surface atmosphere pressure, so they did not risk decompression sickness ('the bends') if they used the rescue hoods to ascend to the surface. But the Arctic water was extremely cold and they could not survive long in the water. Also, water was slowly seeping into the ninth compartment, increasing the atmospheric pressure and thus the risk of decompression sickness and death when they ascended to the surface. In addition it was likely that some of the men were seriously injured and escape would have been <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

The herd instinct is strengthened greatly if those making funding decisions are members of that herd.

2500|$|Benazir Bhutto was prime {{minister}} {{at a time}} of great racial tension in Pakistan. Her approval poll rose by 38% after she appeared and said in a private television interview after the elections: [...] "We are unhappy with the manner in which tampered electoral lists were provided in a majority of constituencies; our voters were turned away." [...] The Conservatives attracted voters from religious society (MMA) whose support had collapsed. The Friday Times noted [...] "Both of them (Nawaz and Benazir) have done so badly in the past, it will be <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to do worse now. If Bhutto's government fails, everyone knows there will be no new elections. The army will take over". In confidential official documents Benazir Bhutto had objected to the number of Urdu speaking class in 1993 elections, in context that she had no Urdu-speaking sentiment in her circle and discrimination was continued even in her government. Her stance on these issues was perceived as part of rising public disclosure which Altaf Hussain called [...] "racism".

40|$|A rapid {{assessment}} was undertaken in early 2005 {{on the impact}} of the Asian tsunami on the CBMS site in the Hambantota District on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. The site which comprises of two coastal lagoon systems – Kalametiya and Rekawa typically represents poor rural coastal communities that were badly impacted by the tsunami. For our rapid assessment, participatory research methods were adopted and included: focus group discussions (FGDs) and a household survey. Data collection was undertaken with the assistance of local field researchers who had been previously engaged in the CBMS study. These community members played a vital role in data collection and methodology development. In addition, the communities in both sites extended their utmost corporation and support during data collection, although these were <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> times <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> This can be at least partly attributed to the involvement of local field researchers in the process, giving the communities a sense of ownership and empowerment. The FGDs were forward-looking and positive – getting the community’s perspective of how best rehabilitation and reconstruction should be undertaken in their area, taking their own priority needs into consideration. The household surveys revisited 210 households which {{have been the subject of}} ongoing research on factors affecting rural livelihoods since 2002.

40|$|Introduction: Patients with HIV/AIDS {{may have}} {{various types of}} {{psychological}} responses. It was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> situation <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> Difficulty can measured by using Adversity Quotient. As a nurse, we can give extrinsic motivation {{to bring back the}} patient HIV/AIDS 2 ̆ 7 s quality of life. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the presence effect of extrinsic motivation on Adversity Quotient in patients with HIV/AIDS in Infectious Disease Intermediateatery Treatment Unit, Dr. Soetomo Hospital, Surabaya. Method: This study was used a quasy experimental purposive sampling design. The population was taken from ambulatory patients. There were 16 respondents who met to the inclusion criteria. The independent variable was extrinsic motivation and dependent variable was Adversity Quotient. Data were collected by using questionnaire and interview, then analyzed by using Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and Mann Whitney U Test with significance level p= 0. 05. Result: The result revealed that there was an effect of extrinsic motivation on Adversity Quotient of patients with HIV/AIDS (p= 0. 017). The extrinsic motivation was found to have an effect on control response (p= 0. 027) and origin response (p= 0. 028), there was no influence of extrinsic motivation on ownership response (p= 0. 334), reach (p= 0. 129) and endurance (p= 0. 161). Discussion: It can be concluded that the extrinsic motivation with intervention of social support has a positive effect on the improvement of Adversity Quotient in patients with HIV/AIDS. Further studies should measure the effectiveness of Adversity Quotient training on acceptance response in patients with HIV/AIDS...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{identified}} {{an association between}} socioeconomic status and sleep health. While some research has studied this association among sexual minority groups, including {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM), they exclusively focused on US-based populations. The interplay between the two in shaping sleep health has not been previously examined on populations residing outside the US. This study considers both determinants, by investigating whether financial hardship is associated with sleep health among a sample of MSM in Paris, France. Broadcast advertisements were placed on a popular geosocial-networking smartphone application for MSM to direct users in Paris to a web-based survey measuring financial hardship and five dimensions of sleep health as well as socio-demographic characteristics. Modified Poisson models with robust error variance were computed to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between financial hardship and the following self-reported outcomes: 1) poor sleep quality, 2) short sleep duration; and 3) sleep problems. In total, 580 respondents completed the survey. In this sample, both financial hardship and poor sleep health were common - 45. 5 % reported that it was extremely, <b>very,</b> or somewhat <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to meet their monthly payments on bills (referred to as “high financial hardship”) and 30. 1 % rated their sleep as fairly bad or very bad (referred to as “poor sleep quality”). Multivariate models revealed that, compared to participants who reported low financial hardship, those who reported high financial hardship were more likely to report poor sleep quality (aRR: 1. 35, 95 % CI: 1. 04, 1. 77), to report problems falling asleep (aRR: 1. 23, 95 % CI: 1. 02, 1. 49), and to report problems staying awake in the daytime (aRR: 3. 12, 95 % CI: 1. 83, 5. 31). Future research should investigate whether this relationship is causal and determine whether interventions to reduce financial hardships could promote sleep health among MSM...|$|R
