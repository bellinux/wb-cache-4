25|$|Wilfred Ward, Newman's first biographer, {{describes}} the Lectures as follows: We have the <b>very</b> <b>curious</b> spectacle of a grave religious apologist giving rein {{for the first}} time at the age of fifty to a sense of rollicking fun and gifts of humorous writing, which if expended on other subjects would naturally have adorned the pages of Thackeray's Punch.|$|E
25|$|Wolf-dog hybrids are {{a mixture}} of genetic traits, which results in less {{predictable}} behavior patterns compared to either the wolf or dog. The adult behavior of hybrid pups also cannot be predicted with comparable certainty to dog pups, even in third-generation pups produced by wolfdog mating with dogs or from {{the behavior of the}} parent animals. Thus, though the behavior of a single individual wolf hybrid may be predictable, the behavior of the type as a whole is not. The majority of high wolf-content hybrids are <b>very</b> <b>curious</b> and are generally no more destructive than any other curious or active dogs.|$|E
25|$|Off Kii Peninsula, in April 2011, {{the same}} whale-watching {{operator}} who had encountered two different right whales in 2006 {{had a very}} close encounter with a right whale. This whale was <b>very</b> <b>curious</b> and active; it swam around a vessel for more than 2 hours, displayed all the aerial actions several times (breaching, spyhopping, tail-slapping, pec-slapping) alongside the vessel, and the vessel had to cruise away from the whale because it kept following the vessel. Many professional whale photographers were on this tour, {{some of them were}} also on the board when this tour operator during the 2006 sightings.|$|E

25|$|The other {{significant}} {{form of communication}} is between the two couples and is different between the genders. Nancy is <b>very</b> <b>curious</b> about and open with the lizards. Though she does become slightly frustrated by their limitations, she tries to help them by explaining aspects of human life they do not understand. Her general kindness toward them and offer of help when the lizards are deciding whether to stay on land or {{to go back to}} the sea influences their decision. Charlie is less forthcoming and more suspicious. He has a hard time accepting the lizards and quickly becomes testy when they do not understand his explanations.|$|E
25|$|The pear-shaped Takifugu, {{like all}} pufferfish, are not fast {{swimmers}} as they mainly use their pectoral fins for propulsion, {{but they are}} very manoeuvrable and able to hover, swim backwards, and change direction much more quickly than most other types of fish. As a result, they are rarely found in open water and prefer to stay relatively close to the sea bed where they can explore complex environments such as oyster beds, seagrass meadows, and rocky reefs. Nevertheless, these fish are <b>very</b> <b>curious</b> and active, and in some cases even aggressive against other fugu or other fish. In the event of danger, the fish inflates itself by filling its extremely elastic stomach with water (or air when outside of the water) until the fish is almost spherical (hence the name blowfish or pufferfish).|$|E
25|$|As of 2006, {{scientists}} had minimal success satellite tagging North Pacific right whales. Observations total probably less than 50 hours {{over the last}} 50 years. What {{little is known about}} North Pacific right whale behavior suggests that it is similar to the behavior of right whales in other oceans, except in its choice of wintering grounds. The individual which was observed during a whale-watching tour off the Kii Peninsula, Japan breached six times in a row in 2006. The same whale watching operator had two different sightings in 2006 and again had a very close encounter with a right whale in 2011. This animal was <b>very</b> <b>curious</b> and active; it swam around the vessel for more than 2 hours, breaching, spyhopping, tail-slapping, and pec-slapping close to the boat. The ship had to cruise away from the whale because it kept following them. Another curious and playful individual was encountered during a whale-watching trip off Bonin Islands in March 2014.|$|E

25|$|Myshkin {{makes the}} {{acquaintance}} of Lizaveta Prokovyevna {{and her three}} daughters—Alexandra, Adelaida and Aglaya, the last being the youngest and the most beautiful. They are all <b>very</b> <b>curious</b> about him and not shy about expressing their opinion, particularly Aglaya. He readily engages with them and speaks with remarkable candor {{on a wide variety}} of subjects – his illness, his impressions of Switzerland, art, philosophy, love, death, the brevity of life, capital punishment, and donkeys. In response to their request that he speaks of the time he was in love, he tells a long anecdote from his time in Switzerland about a downtrodden woman—Marie—whom he befriended, along with a group of children, when she was unjustly subjected to cruel persecution and universal moral condemnation. The Prince ends by describing what he divines about each of their characters from studying their faces and surprises them by saying that Aglaya is almost as beautiful as Nastassya Filippovna.|$|E
25|$|I {{never did}} {{know exactly what}} was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the {{original}} meeting, association, comradeship of Allen , myself, Michael , Lawrence , Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory , for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory {{as well as the}} others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come really close together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's <b>very</b> <b>curious</b> and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which none of us had any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's very interesting that we find ourselves so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.|$|E
500|$|Darwin {{sent the}} {{incomplete}} manuscript to his publisher John Murray on 9 February 1862, {{while he was}} still working on the last chapter. Although anxious that the book might not sell, he could [...] "say with confidence that the M.S. contains many new & <b>very</b> <b>curious</b> facts & [...] conclusions". When the book was printed, he sent out presentation copies to all the individuals and societies who had helped him with his investigations, and to eminent botanists in Britain and abroad for review.|$|E
50|$|The Morab's {{temperament}} and personality is {{best described as}} a true combination of the Morgan and the Arabian. Morabs are generally <b>very</b> intelligent, <b>curious,</b> and personal horses. They are often very quick to learn, and establish strong relationships with humans, who they are eager to please. Morabs make excellent family horses, and are sometimes used as lesson and therapy horses.|$|R
50|$|These giant {{tortoises}} were <b>very</b> slow, <b>curious,</b> {{and had no}} fear of man. They {{were therefore}} easy prey for the first inhabitants of the island, and were slaughtered in vast numbers - to be burnt for oil, as food for people, and also as food for pigs. Large numbers were also stacked into the holds of passing ships, as food supplies for sea trips.|$|R

500|$|After the war, while {{possessing}} false identification {{papers and}} introducing himself as [...] "Josef Huber", Schaub {{was arrested by}} American troops on 8 May 1945 in Kitzbühl, and remained in custody until 17 February 1949. Ultimately, Schaub was classified by denazification investigators as being only a [...] "fellow traveler" [...] and was not accused or associated with any war crimes. Schaub died on 27 December 1967 in his hometown Munich. Junge described Schaub in her memoirs as [...] "extremely kind, but <b>very</b> <b>curious</b> too". She further notes that [...] "for historical purposes, it's not worth saying much about him".|$|E

Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8.0/10, ("Impressive") writing, [...] "For an episode that began ho-hum, things certainly got interesting {{in the last}} half, with two surprise introductions." [...] Goldman praised the fight sequences {{as well as the}} unveiling of Tombstone and Mary Jane. Goldman concluded his review by writing, [...] "It's a testament to this show that it has it exactly right that Peter Parker's everyday, unmasked persona is so integral to the story, and that I actually am <b>very</b> <b>curious</b> how this dance goes." ...|$|E
500|$|Liviu Librescu {{was born}} in 1930 to a Jewish family {{in the city of}} Ploiești, Romania. After Romania allied with Nazi Germany in World War II, his family was {{deported}} to a labor camp in Transnistria, and later, along with thousands of other Jews, was deported to a ghetto in the Romanian city of Focșani. His wife, Marlena, who is also a [...] Holocaust survivor, told Israeli Channel 10 TV the day after his death, [...] "We were in Romania during the Second World War, and we were Jews there among the Germans, and among the anti-Semitic Romanians." [...] Dorothea Weisbuch, a cousin of Librescu living in Romania, said in an interview to Romanian newspaper [...] Cotidianul: [...] "He was an extraordinarily gifted person and very altruistic. When he was little, he was <b>very</b> <b>curious</b> and knew everything, so that I thought he would become very conceited, but it did not happen so; he was of a rare modesty." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{great white}} shark {{is one of only}} a few sharks known to {{regularly}} lift its head above the sea surface to gaze at other objects such as prey. This is known as spy-hopping. This behavior has also been seen in at least one group of blacktip reef sharks, but this might be learned from interaction with humans (it is theorized that the shark may also be able to smell better this way because smell travels through air faster than through water). White sharks are generally <b>very</b> <b>curious</b> animals, display intelligence and may also turn to socializing if the situation demands it. At Seal Island, white sharks have been observed arriving and departing in stable [...] "clans" [...] of two to six individuals on a yearly basis. Whether clan members are related is unknown but they get along peacefully enough. In fact, the social structure of a clan is probably most aptly compared to that of a wolf pack; in that each member has a clearly established rank and each clan has an alpha leader. When members of different clans meet, they establish social rank nonviolently through any of a variety of interactions.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed {{review for}} The Observer, Kitty Empire wrote that Jamie xx [...] "tear up Russell's soundbed entirely and {{showcase}} his own emerging versatility", {{but said that}} while his productions are [...] "consistently excellent, they aren't really there to augment Scott-Heron's words". Andy Gill of The Independent commented that the remixing techniques [...] "only occasionally work in its favour". Louise Brailey of NME wrote that he [...] "coaxes fresh narratives from the source material" [...] and that it [...] "isn’t exactly groundbreaking, but it showcases a producer {{so in love with}} the music of now that he not only preserves the power of his source material, but makes it more relevant". In MSN Music, Christgau called the record [...] "a young man's bad dream about mortality, and of interest as such", and wrote of the source material's importance to Jamie xx's remix, [...] "the snatches of Scott-Heron's voice, cracked for sure but deeper than night nonetheless, delivers it from callow generalization and foregone conclusion." [...] August Brown of the Los Angeles Times felt that [...] "the duo lends each other gravitas and levity on this <b>very</b> <b>curious</b> but ultimately immersive LP".|$|E
500|$|Frederick the Great was {{published}} later in 1970 to a muted reception. Mitford's remaining years {{were dominated by}} her illness, although for a time she enjoyed visits from her sisters and friends, and working in her garden. In April 1972 the French government made her a Chevalier of the Légion d'Honneur, and later that year the British government appointed her a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). She was delighted by the former honour, and amused by the latter—which she remembered Waugh had called an [...] "insult" [...] and turned down. At the end of 1972 she entered the Nuffield Clinic in London, where {{she was diagnosed with}} Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the blood. She lived for another six months, unable to look after herself and in almost constant pain, struggling to keep her spirits up. She wrote to her friend James Lees-Milne: [...] "It's <b>very</b> <b>curious,</b> dying, and would have many a drôle amusing & charming side {{were it not for the}} pain". She died on 30 June 1973 at her home in the rue d'Artois and was cremated in Versailles, after which her ashes were taken to Swinbrook for burial alongside her sister Unity.|$|E
50|$|None of Sophie's {{letters to}} Diderot {{has ever been}} found and no {{portrait}} of Sophie has survived. The only concrete details known about her are that she wore glasses, was often in poor health, and had la menotte sèche (small, dry hands) but that she was apparently <b>very</b> intellectually <b>curious</b> and capable, studying both science and philosophy, for which Diderot admired her very much. She died on February 22, 1784 and Diderot only survived her by five months.|$|R
6000|$|But, {{after the}} {{appearance}} of Reichel's speculations, the Homeric words for [...] "round" [...] and [...] "circular" [...] have been explained as meaning something else, and Mr. Leaf, in place of maintaining that Homer knew no shields but round shields, now writes (1900), [...] "The small circular shield of later times...is equally unknown to Homer, with a <b>very</b> few <b>curious</b> exceptions," [...] which Reichel discovered-- erroneously, as we shall later try to show.

500|$|When Ehrich first {{stepped into}} the role, he stated: [...] "There [...] so many places where they can go with this role. I have just gotten back into Genoa City. It’s such a {{vulnerable}} age, so really there [...] so many different paths I can go down. And there’s so much that can happen. I’m very, <b>very</b> <b>curious</b> to see where they go with it." [...] When asked how he would describe Fenmore, Ehrich said: [...] "He is definitely figuring himself out. You’re {{on the brink of}} adulthood. You have to start taking a bit of responsibility. [...] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." [...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is. He has such a strict dad, who just became D.A., so of course his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong." [...] Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that the character had become [...] "creepy" [...] during his angst and acting out.|$|E
500|$|Soon, Shakira {{began work}} on her next studio album, titled She Wolf, which was, among other places, {{recorded}} at the Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that specifically chose the studio after she learned that it had previously been used for recording sessions by artists like Bob Marley, The Cure, and AC/DC, of whom she is a fan. Unlike most of her previous projects, which are predominantly composed of Latin and pop rock styles, She Wolf is an electropop album with world music influences. When asked why the album had electronic influences, Shakira responded, [...] "I felt <b>very</b> <b>curious</b> and intrigued about the electro-pop world and everything it has to offer. I {{wanted to make sure}} that this album was very bassy and that the kicks hit really hard, and I wanted to concentrate on the beat. But my music, to a certain extent, is very complex– because I always try to experiment with sounds from other parts of the world." [...] Explaining the meaning behind the title, Shakira said that [...] "'She Wolf' is the woman of our time. The woman who knows what she wants and is free of prejudice and preconceived notions. She defends her deepest desires with teeth and claws like a wild animal".|$|E
500|$|Clive Russell, who portrayed Blackfish, {{spoke about}} working with Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth, noting [...] "There's {{something}} <b>very</b> <b>curious,</b> by the way, I'm probably about 6'6" [...] tall. I think she's about 6'3", but all the time I worked with her, I {{felt like she was}} taller than me. Now I don't really know what {{that has to do with}} it. It might be something to do with being confronted by a physically charismatic very tall woman, or maybe it's that she's caught the impressiveness of the character of that woman, that soldier. She's also an extraordinarily hilarious woman. We had great fun together. It was great fun to play." [...] Gwendoline Christie also spoke about filming with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who portrays Jaime Lannister, again, saying [...] "I was excited, It was really fun to be with Nikolaj again, and I thought the way of which their reunion happens is not really expected. I just loved that it was so formal, because within the confines of such formality, and having to negotiate with each other, there are so many other stories begging to be told in those moments. There's a slow process of creeping familiarity among two people who haven't been together for a long time; it was allowed to build." [...] Coster-Waldau also spoke about their first reunion scene, stating [...] "It's a great scene. These characters are so much about holding their cards so close to their chest and they don't want to reveal how they're feeling. But we know there's history between them, that this is more than two knights meeting. But they would never acknowledge that." ...|$|E
