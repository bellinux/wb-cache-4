40|$|The {{evaporation}} of methanol from needle-shaped {{particles of}} cellobiose octaacetate (COA) {{has been studied}} directly in a jacketed <b>vacuum</b> <b>drier</b> using in situ measurements by Raman spectrometry. A design of experiments (DoE) approach was used to investigate the effects of three parameters (method of agitation, % solvent loss on drying and jacket temperature), {{with the intention of}} minimising the drying time and extent of particle attrition. Drying curves based on Raman signals for methanol and COA in the spectra of the wet particles indicated the end of drying and revealed three stages in the drying process {{that could be used to}} monitor the progress of solvent removal in real time. Off-line particle size measurements based on laser diffraction were made to obtain information on the extent of attrition, to compare with the trends revealed by the Raman drying curves.

40|$|It is {{advantageous}} to formulate protein drugs as dry powders to enhance stability {{to achieve a}} desired shelf-life for the product. However, the inherent steps involved, in the commonly used process of lyophilization, lead to protein instability in many cases. In the present work, a novel process based on the precipitation of proteins by polyethylene glycols (PEG) and followed by <b>vacuum</b> <b>drying</b> of the precipitate {{in the presence of}} stabilizers, is proposed to formulate proteins as dry powders. ^ The feasibility studies were carried out using interferon alpha- 2 a (IFNα 2 a) as a model protein. Precipitation of IFNα 2 a was successfully carried out at pH 6. 5 using various molecular weight PEGs. Ten percent w/v PEG 1450 at pH 6. 5 and at a solution ionic strength of 71 mM precipitated about 97 % of the protein from a 1 mg/ml IFNα 2 a solution. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>drying</b> of the precipitated protein containing 1 : 10 : 100 w/w IFNα 2 a:trehalose:mannitol ratio at 100 mTorr and at a shelf temperature of 25 °C resulted in complete drying within 24 hours (final residual moisture content of 1 % w/w). Both mannitol and trehalose were effective in preventing formation of insoluble aggregates of IFNα 2 a during <b>vacuum</b> <b>drying</b> of the precipitate. From a separate set of studies the stabilizing action of mannitol was attributed to its tendency to remain amorphous in the presence of proteins upon <b>vacuum</b> <b>drying.</b> ^ Accelerated stability studies indicated that the <b>vacuum</b> <b>dried</b> formulation containing IFNα 2 a:mannitolarehalose in a 1 : 10 : 100 w/w ratio exhibited sufficient ratio exhibited at stability when stored at 40 °C for 3 months. The stability of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>dried</b> formulation of IFNα 2 a was comparable to that of a similar lyophilized formulation. ^ In an attempt to understand protein tertiary structure in solid state, a novel technique based on the steady state Trp fluorescence spectroscopy of proteins was developed. This technique demonstrated that mannitol was ineffective to preserve IFNα 2 a tertiary structure in the solid state, whereas, trehalose was effective in preserving both the secondary as well as the tertiary structure of IFNα 2 a upon drying. ^ This work demonstrates that proteins can be conveniently formulated as dry powders by PEG-induced precipitation of proteins followed by <b>vacuum</b> <b>drying</b> of the precipitate. ...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the influence of the preparation method (the impact of freezing treatment at- 18 ºC, osmotic dehydration in sucrose solution 61. 5 %) of raw material and storage (from 32 days to 399 days) on the rehydration of dried strawberries. Dried strawberries obtained by the vacuum method from frozen fruits have larger relative weight gain with prolongation of rehy-dration time than dried fruits obtained from raw strawberries. Osmotic dehydration of straw-berries before <b>vacuum</b> <b>drying</b> did not cause a significant difference in rehydration of dried strawberries stored for a long period. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>dried</b> strawberries stored for about 360 days longer at ambient temperature obtained slightly lower relative weight gain and higher solids content. Key words: rehydration, <b>vacuum</b> <b>dried</b> fruits, osmotic dehydration, storag...|$|R
