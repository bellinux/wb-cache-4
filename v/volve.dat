40|$|This {{report is}} {{the results of}} the work on a master thesis {{concerning}} intelligent monitoring of hydro power stations. In the report two different types of computer software is investigated to find out whether they are suitable to make out a monitoring system capable of giving the user information about faults and unwanted operating conditions at an early stage. It is also investigated whether the software has proven the capability to detect faults and unwanted operating conditions. The different advantages and disadvantages of the two software products are commented and the two software products are compared. This report shows that the two software products are quite different. The software from <b>Volve</b> is software meant to construct an expert system capable of recognising faults from previous cases of faults. The software from SKF is software that gives intelligent machine diagnostics from analysis of vibration measurements in addition to measuring and trending of other variables. It also gives the user tools for analysing the root cause of faults influencing the bearing system of different industry machinery. This means that the software from SKF demands some involvement from the user to produce the best and most precise results. The expert system developed from the <b>Volve</b> software on the other hand is meant to present only results and advice to the user. The results from tests and simulations of the expert system developed by the <b>Volve</b> software are very limited. It is not possible to conclude which of the two software products is better before more tests of the <b>Volve</b> system is performed. In addition to the investigation of these two monitoring software products two different types of sensors are investigated. The sensors that are investigated are smoke sensors and sensors for detection of ultrasonic sound. Both types are commonly used in monitoring of industry processes similar to those in hydro power stations. These two sensors are capable of giving additional information to the monitoring system making it possible to detect faults {{that it is difficult to}} detect today. This is because the two sensor types perform measurements that the normal measuring equipment of today is incapable of. This will increase the information flow to the monitoring systems of hydro power stations making it possible to perform better and more precise monitoring. </p...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{hydropower}} stations are equipped with the latest technology in both regulation and remote control, {{it is not enough}} to replace the traditional machine expert. The machine expert was a person stationed in the power plant. He had the responsibility for the running and maintenance of the station. This person’s experience and human senses made him crucial for the surveillance of the station. Since the machine expert has now been replaced by electronics and newer technology, there are still areas of his expertise that are to be made. Today’s facilities are highly sophisticated and contain the latest technology, but there are still situations that the surveillance system may fail to intercept. To help the surveillance system detect these situations, the idea is to implement an expert system. In this way the control system can match the machine expert’s skills. Oystein Fjellheim has already done extensive work in finding a suitable development kit. He explored several software packages looking for one to use for this purpose [XXFjellheimM]. The result was the program <b>Volve</b> Knowledge Tools, and the purpose of this report is to further test this program for use in expert systems. This testing considers more advanced and intelligent forms of reading raw data, such as mean calculation, derivation and integration. It also includes testing of how the program learns and uses existing knowledge to solve problems. Since hydropower plants can be constructed in so many ways, it is almost impossible to make an expert system that can include all varieties. One solution is to narrow down the system to a reference system. This system consists of defined components that are common in today’s facilities. Despite this narrowing there are still many processes in a hydropower station that need to be monitored. Voith Siemens has promoted that thermal surveillance is desirable. The reason is that, when performing thermal surveillance, the rest of the system would be indirectly monitored as well. A good example of this would be to monitor the bearings. To detect the condition of a bearing, one has to compare several parameters, of which temperature is the most essential. Two conditions of the bearing are simulated, defective bearing and water in the bearing oil. When constructing the program, three models were made: an ontology model, a causal model and a case model. All models were made pursuant to the reference system. The models are general, but still represent a good approach to the real world. All three models are considered as a good starting point for further work. By developing a simple expert system in <b>Volve</b> Knowledge Tools and using this program for simulations, I gathered a lot of information about how the program operates and functions. After considering advantages versus disadvantages, and the suitability of the program for developing expert systems, I concluded that: <b>Volve</b> Knowledge Tools fulfils the demands that the development an expert system entails. I therefore recommend by <b>Volve</b> Knowledge Tools as the development kit for evolving an expert system in continuing work. </p...|$|E
