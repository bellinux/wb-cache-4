5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and the <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{the cause of the}} disease until 1903 when Adelchi Negri (1876–1912) first saw {{microscopic}} lesions– now called Negri bodies– in the brains of rabid animals. He wrongly thought they were protozoan parasites. Paul Remlinger (1871–1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa, and even smaller than bacteria. Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150nanometres long, now known to be the size of rhabdovirus particles– the <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> rabies.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis {{has existed}} for {{thousands}} of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art. The disease was first recognized as a distinct condition by Michael Underwood in 1789 and the <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> it was first identified in 1908 by Karl Landsteiner. Major outbreaks started {{to occur in the}} late 19th century in Europe and the United States. In the 20th century it {{became one of the most}} worrying childhood diseases in these areas. The first polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Jonas Salk. It is hoped that vaccination efforts and early detection of cases will result in global eradication of the disease by 2018.|$|E

25|$|Chlamydia, human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV), gonorrhea, herpes, hepatitis (multiple strains), and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), {{can be transmitted}} through oral sex. Any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with HIV, the <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> AIDS, poses a risk of infection. Risk of STI infection, however, is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex, with HIV transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex.|$|E

This led to the World Health Organization declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. The emergency was lifted in November 2016, but 84 countries still reported cases as of March 2017.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, a Kaiser Family Foundation {{study found}} that 95% of public {{secondary}} schools offered sex education programs.

A 2000 {{study found that}} almost all schools included information about HIV, the <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> AIDS, in their curricula. There have been efforts among social conservatives in the US government to limit sex education in public schools to abstinence-only sex education curricula.

25|$|Humans can be {{infected}} with foot-and-mouth disease through contact with infected animals, {{but this is}} extremely rare. Some cases were caused by laboratory accidents. Because the <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> FMD is sensitive to stomach acid, it cannot spread to humans via consumption of infected meat, except in the mouth before the meat is swallowed. In the UK, the last confirmed human case occurred in 1966, {{and only a few}} other cases have been recorded in countries of continental Europe, Africa, and South America. Symptoms of FMD in humans include malaise, fever, vomiting, red ulcerative lesions (surface-eroding damaged spots) of the oral tissues, and sometimes vesicular lesions (small blisters) of the skin. According to a newspaper report, FMD killed two children in England in 1884, supposedly due to infected milk.|$|E
25|$|These lesions are all Type one infections {{also known}} {{specifically}} as Herpes simplex, Herpes Zoster, and Herpes Gladiatorial are {{all types of}} herpes that are common in skin to skin contact sports. Type two herpes is known as herpes on the genitals which is spread through sexual contact. These lesions come from skin to skin contact or body secretions. The skin starts to develop blisters which can happen anywhere on the body. To return to any activity one must be cleared by a doctor. Herpes Simplex is the <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> cold sores this virus can be spread by oral seceretions and can also cause Herpes Gladiatorial. Once a person becomes infected the virus stays in the body forever and can reactivate itself anytime causing cold sores. Herpes Gladiatorial is a skin infection. {{it comes from the}} Herpes Simplex virus which is causes the same lesion one has when they have a cold sore. This form of herpes is on the skin and can be spread through contact with others or sharing beverages with someone who is infected or using anything that they may have contaminated. This virus remains in your system and can reactivate itself at any time causing lesions to appear. Herpes Zoster is the virus which causes shingles and chicken pox. Once one has had the chicken pox they carry the virus forever. Once one has chicken pox the virus is inactive but, if it becomes active again they get the shingles.|$|E

2500|$|The white {{appearance}} {{is created by}} hyperkeratosis (overproduction of keratin) and epithelial hyperplasia.

After the primary EBV infection has been overcome, the virus will persist {{for the rest of}} the host's life and [...] "hides" [...] from the immune system by latent infection of B lymphocytes. The virus also causes lytic infection in the oropharynx, but is kept in check by a normal, functioning immune system. Uncontrolled lytic infection is manifested as oral hairy leukoplakia in immunocompromised hosts. OHL usually arises where the immunocompromise is secondary to HIV/AIDS. Rarely are other causes of immunocompromise associated with OHL, but it has been reported in people who have received transplants and are taking immunosuppressive medication. OHL may also accompany chronic graft versus host disease. Even more rare are reports of OHL in persons with competent immune systems.|$|E
2500|$|The 2008 award went to Harald zur Hausen [...] in {{recognition}} of his discovery that human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause cervical cancer, and to Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier for discovering the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Whether Robert Gallo or Luc Montagnier deserved more credit for {{the discovery of the}} <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> AIDS has been a matter of considerable controversy. As it was, Gallo was left out and not awarded a prize. Additionally, there was scandal when it was learned that Harald zur Hausen was being investigated for having a financial interest in vaccines for the cervical cancer that HPV can cause. AstraZeneca, who with a stake in two lucrative HPV vaccines could benefit financially from the prize, had agreed to sponsor Nobel Media and Nobel Web. According to Times Online, two senior figures in the selection process that chose zur Hausen also had strong links with AstraZeneca.|$|E
