Here, we report the first demonstration of the VCMA effect in novel epitaxial Ru/Co 2 FeAl(CFA) /MgO heterostructures with interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Perpendicularly magnetized tunnel junctions with the structure of Ru/CFA/MgO were fabricated and exhibited an effective <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> on <b>switching</b> fields for the CFA free layer. A large VCMA coefficient of 108 (139) fJ/Vm for the CFA film was achieved at room temperature (4 K). The interfacial stability in the heterostructure was confirmed by repeating measurements.

It is found that the temperature dependences follow power laws of the saturation magnetization with an exponent of ~ 2.

30|$|Because {{switching}} {{transmission lines}} {{can change the}} network topology and consequently alter the distribution of power flows, switching out some transmission lines can be an alternative <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> method. <b>Switching</b> out transmission lines can physically remove the equivalent shunt capacitors of the lines. In addition, switching out lines {{will lead to the}} power flow increases of other lines indirectly, and thereby increase the consumption of reactive power. Some power system operators in different regions of China have chosen to switch out some transmission lines to relieve the voltage violations during spring festivals in recent years. However, the system operators usually make the transmission line switching decisions {{on the basis of their}} experience. The choices of the transmission lines to be switched out and the coordination with other <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> measures are actually a type of optimal transmission switching (TS) problem.

The change in the magnetic properties {{of the system is}} observed in a relatively thick film of 15 nm. A surface charge is induced by the formation of electrochemical double layer between the metallic thin film and non-aqueous lithium LiClO 4 electrolyte to manipulate the magnetism. The change in the magnetic properties occurred by the application of an external electric field. As the negative voltage was increased, the coercivity and the switching magnetic field decreased thus activating magnetization switching. The results are envisaged to lead to faster and ultra-low power magnetization switching as compared to spin-transfer torque (STT) switching in spintronic devices. Comment: 5 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

Some of these constraints represent limits on the number of switching operations of transformer load tap changers (LTCs) and capacitors, which are modeled as discrete control variables. The discrete variables are treated here as continuous variables during the solution process, thus transforming the MINLP problem into an NLP problem that can be more efficiently solved exploiting its highly sparse matrix structure; a strategy is developed to round these variables off to their nearest discrete values, so that daily switching operation limits are properly met. The proposed method is compared with respect to other well-known MINLP solution methods, namely, a genetic algorithm and the popular GAMS MINLP solvers BARON and DICOPT.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a MEMS RF switch designed and developed specifically for space communication systems, {{with a novel}} geometry and operating mode that overcome the drawbacks of previous devices. To avoid the need for high <b>voltage</b> <b>control,</b> the <b>switch</b> uses electro-thermal rather than electrostatic operation; although this requires higher power consumption during switching, a latching configuration was used such that the hold power is zero in either switch state. This requires that the actuation is lateral (with respect to the chip surface) rather than vertical as in most MEMS switches. Lateral actuation allowed a large open-state separation to be achieved, leading to high-isolation performance. The latching operation also inherently provides high mechanical stability. While most reported MEMS switches have been 2 -port series or shunt switches, the system requirement addressed here was for a 3 -port, single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switch (i. e. one input, two selectable outputs). To keep the device compact, this necessitated the use of strongly confining transmission lines, so thin-film microstrip (TFMS), rather than coplanar waveguides (CPWG), was used. By integrating low-loss TFMS with our novel MEMS switch geometry, the SPDT switch operation was achieved with good initial performance, including operating voltage 3 V, isolation 50 dB and insertion loss 1. 8 dB at 5 GHz, and operating range 1 - 20 GHz.

40|$|Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as {{many other}} {{utilities}} uses breaker switched capacitor banks for voltage support and reactive power compensation in grid substations. At present it has a 320 Mvar installed capacity and 70 Mvar more to be come in next few years. The main intentions {{of the use of}} capacitor banks is to give voltage support at the substation level, reduction of losses in power transformers and transmission lines, and to release the capacity constraints in transformers and lines. CEB uses power factor regulation for switching these capacitor banks. The general view of the system control center (SCC) who operates the network is that this concept does not allow economical utilization of capacitor banks and sometimes they need to manually switch on them overriding the auto controller and vise versa. Underutilizing an economical reactive power source is a factor to consider. Therefore, the objective of this research is to study the technical feasibility of connecting maximum available capacitor banks in each sub station and by doing so, to propose a better switching policy than the existing one. The research was planned as a case study, selecting a typical grid sub station in CEB and then, the results are expected to be extrapolated to a general concept, to suit the whole CEB network. First, actual substation data was collected, logged and analyzed. The possibilities of connecting more capacitor banks, under such real time system characteristics were studied in a computer simulation model. PSCAD is the simulation software used for the network simulations. The impacts due to additional banks on the system conditions, technical constraints, non violation of general standards and economics were studied using the results from the simulations. The results were compared with actual data measurement by forcing the simulated conditions for the maximum utilization, in the real system. The analysis revealed that the present switching concept does not fully fit for CEB network. The possibilities of further utilization of already installed capacitor banks, was identified. Instead of present switching criteria, reactive power based <b>control</b> and <b>voltage</b> based <b>control</b> schemes were evaluated. Although the present criterion has a comparatively high utilization factor, it also seems that banks are not utilized at mostly required periods. As per the observations, reactive power <b>controlled</b> capacitor bank <b>switching</b> criteria is more useful compared to loss reduction in the system. When comparing the <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> based <b>switching,</b> the switching pattern is similar to the pattern with reactive power <b>control</b> based <b>switching</b> in the day time. -During night time it gets closure to the requirement that SCC actually needs. However, complex algorithms are necessary to coordinate the two control loops, AVR and capacitor bank controller when-using such <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> schemes.
