5|$|Beginning in 2014, a minor moral panic {{occurred}} over the Slender Man after readers of his fiction were connected to several <b>violent</b> <b>acts,</b> particularly a near-fatal stabbing of a 12-year-old girl in Waukesha, Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|In the film, {{most of the}} {{numerous}} acts of violence are committed off-screen. The <b>violent</b> <b>acts</b> were also designed to be quick, reflecting the actual speed {{of violence in the}} real world. The focus was not on the direct victims of the perpetuated violence, but the impact of violence on the perpetrators or witnesses to the act.|$|E

40|$|Limited {{research}} has examined attributional biases {{in the context}} of extreme intergroup conflict, and the research that does exist contains methodological shortcomings. To remedy this, 282 Indonesians read a newspaper article describing a violent incident in Ambon. Christians (but not Muslims) used stronger situational attributions for <b>violent</b> ingroup <b>acts</b> than for <b>violent</b> outgroup <b>acts.</b> In contrast, both Muslims and Christians used stronger dispositional attributions for <b>violent</b> outgroup <b>acts</b> than for <b>violent</b> ingroup <b>acts.</b> This latter tendency emerged independently of who was described in the article as the perpetrators of the violence. Implications for our understanding of intergroup conflict are discussed...|$|R
5|$|In a rare {{example of}} the {{political}} protest for which Trafalgar Square is famous occurring in the National Gallery, the Rokeby Venus was damaged on 10 March 1914 by Mary Richardson, a campaigner for women's suffrage, in protest against the arrest of Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day. Later that month another suffragette attacked five Bellinis, causing the Gallery to close until {{the start of the}} First World War, when the Women's Social and Political Union {{called for an end to}} <b>violent</b> <b>acts</b> drawing attention to their plight.|$|E
5|$|Fairman {{writes that}} legal {{precedent}} regarding {{use of the}} word is unclear because of contradictory court decisions. He presents case studies of these contradictory applications of the law, and uses them to analyze public perceptions surrounding freedom of speech. He provides examples of exceptions to the First Amendment, such as speech intended to cause <b>violent</b> <b>acts,</b> and discusses the manner in which federal and state governments sanction these exceptions. Fairman draws parallels between protection of comedians' usage of taboo language to the ability of individuals in society to express ideas freely. He argues that once citizens allow the government to restrict specific words {{that can be used in}} speech, this will lead to an encroachment upon freedom of thought.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{with severe}} mental illness, {{including}} schizophrenia, {{are at a}} significantly greater risk of being victims of both violent and non-violent crime. Schizophrenia {{has been associated with}} a higher rate of <b>violent</b> <b>acts,</b> but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse. Rates of homicide linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse, and parallel the overall rate in a region. What role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug misuse is controversial, but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors. About 11% of people in prison for homicide have schizophrenia while 21% have mood disorders. Another study found about 8-10% of people with schizophrenia had committed a violent act in the past year compared to 2% of the general population.|$|E

5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and <b>violent</b> <b>acts,</b> are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon {{be taken off the}} ship.|$|E
25|$|Independent India has {{witnessed}} caste-related violence. According to a 2005 UN report, approximately 31,440 cases of <b>violent</b> <b>acts</b> committed against Dalits {{were reported in}} 1996. The UN report claimed 1.33 cases of <b>violent</b> <b>acts</b> per 10,000 Dalit people. For context, the UN reported between 40 and 55 cases of <b>violent</b> <b>acts</b> per 10,000 people in developed countries in 2005. One example of such violence is the Khairlanji massacre of 2006.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the above}} cited evidence, {{psychiatrist}} David Healy and certain patient activist groups have compiled case reports of <b>violent</b> <b>acts</b> committed by individuals taking fluoxetine or other SSRIs, and {{have argued that}} these drugs predispose susceptible individuals to commit <b>violent</b> <b>acts.</b>|$|E

25|$|Social and {{cultural}} aspects may significantly {{interfere with the}} distinct expression of aggressiveness.

50|$|It is {{here that}} the <b>violent</b> <b>act</b> is carried out. In order to be as {{effective}} as possible, any inhibition about killing innocent people must be overcome.
