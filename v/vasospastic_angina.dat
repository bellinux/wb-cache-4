Following this clinical description, Constantinides 9, in 1995, raised the possibility that ‘‘even ordinary allergic reactions could promote plaque disruption’’ that can lead to coronary thrombus formation and coronary occlusion. This was based on Constantinides’s observation that circulating mast cell precursors could penetrate the open junctions between endothelial cells that line human atheromatous plaques in contrast to closed junctions over the normal arterial intima.

The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of diagnosing <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> based on coronary artery tone as assessed by M-mode echocardiographic measurement of the dilation response of the left main coronary artery to nitroglycerin. Background. The definite diagnosis of <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> is done by a coronary spasm provocative test using ergonovine maleate or acetylcholine during cardiac catherization. Current noninvasive, nonpharmacologic diagnostic methods are not sensitive enough for the diagnosis of <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina.</b> Methods. Thirty-eight patients who had an angiographically normal left main trunk were studied. These patients were classified into four groups based on the presence or absence of more than 50 % stenosis in the coronary arteries except for the left main trunk and the results of the acetylcholine or ergonovine provocative test. At 7 a. m. and at noon on the same day, the left main trunk diameter was measured by M-mode echocardiography before and after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin (0. 3 mg), and its percent dilation was calculated to assess coronary artery tone. Results. The percent dilation of the left main trunk diameter induced by sublingual nitroglycerin at 7 a. m. and at noon was 22. 4 ± 4. 7 % (mean ± SD) and 18. 1 ± 4. 0 % in 11 patients with <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> and without coronary stenosis, 14. 9 ± 7. 1 % and 11. 2 ± 6. 9 % in 9 patients with <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> and coronary stenosis, 6. 1 ± 3. 5 % and 7. 0 ± 5. 1 % in 8 patients without <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> but with coronary stenosis and 8. 1 ± 5. 6 % and 7. 8 ± 5. 7 % in 10 control subjects. The percent dilation at 7 a. m. was significantly greater in the <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> without coronary stenosis group than in the remaining three groups, and in the <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> groups, the percent dilation at 7 a. m. was significantly greater than that at noon.

In addition, the prevalence of typical symp-toms is higher among people of South Asian descent than among white people. 3 Despite these findings, it is widely per-ceived that women, 4 – 6 South Asian people 7 – 9 and other ethnic minorities with suspected ischemia are more likely than white men to report atypical features of pain. 10, 11 This has been attributed to <b>vasospastic</b> and microvascular <b>angina</b> in women 12 and to the higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus 13 and socio-economic deprivation 7 among South Asian people.

Among subjects with angiographically smooth coronary arteries, we selected 14 subjects with <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> and 14 age- and gender-matched subjects with atypical chest pain. We compared coronary vasomotor response to acetylcholine infusion, glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose load (75 g), serum lipid concentrations, obesity, heart rate, blood pressure and smoking habits in both groups. Results. Fasting serum insulin concentrations and insulin response were higher in subjects with <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> than in those with atypical chest pain; however, glucose tolerance, obesity, heart rate, blood pressure and smoking habits did not differ between groups. In subjects with <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina,</b> nearly all coronary segments, except distal segments of the left circuraflex coronary artery, were constricted at peak acetylcholine infusion (20 to 100 μg), whereas all segments were dilated in subjects with atypical chest pain.

40|$|SummaryVasospastic angina is a {{frequent}} and well-recognized pathology with {{a high risk of}} life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The diagnosis of <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> requires the combination of clinical and electrocardiographic variables and the results of provocation tests, such as ergonovine administration. Smoking cessation {{is the first step in}} the management of <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina.</b> Optimal medical treatment using calcium-channel blockers and/or nitrate derivatives can provide protection, but life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias may occur despite optimal medical treatment and several years after the start of treatment. In this review, we evaluate the role of implantable defibrillators as a complement to optimal medical management in patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias due to vasospastic angina; this role is not well characterized in the literature or guidelines. We discuss the role of implantable defibrillators in secondary prevention in light of three recent cases managed in our departments and a review of the literature.

The percent change in coronary diameter after ergonovine and nitrate administration compared with the control diameter was used as an index of coronary vasoreactivity. In patients with <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina,</b> coronary artery responses to both ergonovine and nitrate were greater in the spastic segments than in the other segments (p < 0. 05), and those of the coronary arteries without spasm were greater than those of the coronary arteries in patients without ischemic heart disease (p < 0. 01). There {{were no significant differences between}} the coronary artery diameters in the two groups after nitrate administration, and the control diameters were less in patients with <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> than in patients without ischemic heart disease.

40|$|The {{coronary}} artery diseases (CAD) {{that can lead}} to the occurrence of a syncopal attack include acute coronary syndrome, <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina,</b> effort angina, and prior myocardial infarction. The possible mechanisms considered to lead to syncope in patients with CAD are pump failure, tachyarrhythmia, bradycardia, and vagal stimulation. Coronary artery spasm, in particular, is occasionally observed in patients with unexplained syncope in Japan. Life-threatening arrhythmias are among the most serious complications of an ischemic attack caused by coronary spasm, and are associated with an increased risk of syncope and/or sudden cardiac death (SCD). Therefore, during the initial evaluation of unexplained syncope, the diagnosis of <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> (VSA) needs to be made promptly, to avert the risk of SCD as a consequence of syncope triggered by the lethal arrhythmia. The inducibility of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, increased QT dispersion, T-wave alternans, and early repolarization during the asymptomatic period are considered risk markers for ventricular arrhythmias during coronary spasm.

The autonomic nervous system has been proposed to {{play a key role}} in attacks of <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina.</b> A unique feature of <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> attacks is periodic fluctuation, which complicates the assessment of disease activity. Methods. Twenty-five patients with left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) spasm were studied: 12 with recent onset of chest pain (group 1) and 13 free of angina for more than 3 months after discontinuing medication (group 2). Group 1 underwent iodine- 123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging (in the active phase) and atropine-stress MIBG imaging early after diagnostic angiography, and repeat MIBG imaging when they were free of angina for more than 3 months with medication (in the stable phase). Group 2 also underwent MIBG imaging (in remission). On a bull's-eye map, quantitative analysis of percent uptake and washout rate of MIBG was performed regionally. Results. In group 1 in the active phase, the washout rate of the LAD territory was significantly lower than the rates in the stable phase, in remission and during atropine-stress MIBG imaging. The regional washout rate of the territories of the right coronary artery and the circumflex artery in the active phase was also significantly lower than that during atropine-stress MIBG imaging. The washout rate of the LAD territory in the active phase was significantly lower than the rates of the other two regions. In contrast, there were no significant differences in the distribution of regional percent uptake in every image.

We {{assessed}} {{the ability of}} iodine- 123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging to identify and localize coronary spasm and determined the most useful method of MIBG analysis in <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> without significant coronary narrowing. Background. Various noninvasive methods {{have been used to}} detect <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina,</b> but they are not very sensitive in patients with sporadic attacks. MIBG imaging has recently been proposed as a useful tool for detecting <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina.</b> Methods. Normal limits of both visual and quantitative analysis of two-dimensional polar maps (bull’s-eyes) for MIBG imaging were at first established in 59 normal subjects. For optimal criteria of visual analysis, we established regional differences in abnormal MIBG defect scores. An abnormal region of the bull’s-eye was defined as an area > 2 SD below normal. An abnormal regional washout rate was defined as < 0 %. Using these criteria, we prospectively evaluated 104 patients with suspected <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina.</b> Visual, bull’s-eye and regional washout rate analyses were compared for overall detection of the disease and for individual vessel involvement. Results. Overall sensitivity by these methods was 30 %, 42 % and 76 %, respectively. Washout rate analysis showed a significantly higher sensitivity than the other two methods. Specificity was 78 %, 72 % and 87 %, respectively. The sensitivity of detecting spasm-induced coronary artery with washout rate analysis was 82 % for the left anterior descending (LAD), 76 % for the right (RCA) and 69 % for the circumflex (Cx) coronary arteries.

Although withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation of therapy with some cardiovascular drugs, there is no detailed report on similar complications of the cessation of therapy with calcium antagonists. In a 4 -month period eight patients with well documented and well controlled <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> experienced a marked increase in the frequency and duration of anginal episodes at rest following the involuntary cessation of treatment with nifedipine, 10 to 20 mg four times a day. The increase began within 2 to 5 days after the cessation of treatment. Substitute therapy with isosorbide dinitrate, 30 mg, and verapamil, 80 to 120 mg, each four times a day, was effective in all cases. Although the mechanism responsible for this rebound phenomenon is not known, awareness of its existence is essential considering the widespread use of calcium antagonists...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the efficacy and safety of amlodipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, in patients with <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina.</b> BACKGROUND. Previous studies have established the value of short-acting calcium channel blockers in the treatment of coronary spasm. METHODS. Fifty-two patients with well documented <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> were entered into the present study. After a single-blind placebo run-in period, patients were randomized (in a double-blind protocol) to receive either amlodipine (10 mg) or placebo every morning for 4 weeks. Twenty-four patients received amlodipine and 28 received placebo. All patients were given diaries in which to record both the frequency, severity, duration and circumstances of anginal episodes and their intake of sublingual nitroglycerin tablets. RESULTS. The rate of anginal episodes decreased significantly (p = 0. 009) with amlodipine treatment compared with placebo and the intake of nitroglycerin tablets showed a similar trend. Peripheral edema was the only adverse event seen more frequently in amlodipine-treated patients. No patient was withdrawn from the double-blind phase of the study because of an adverse event. Patients who completed the double-blind phase as responders to amlodipine or as nonresponders to placebo were offered the option of receiving amlodipine in a long-term, open label extension phase. During the extension, the daily dose of amlodipine was adjusted to 5 or 15 mg if needed and the rate of both anginal episodes and nitroglycerin tablet consumption showed statistically significant decreases between baseline and final assessment. CONCLUSION. This study suggests that amlodipine given once daily is efficacious and safe in the treatment of <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives：The {{causes of}} <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> {{are not well}} known. We {{attempted}} to elucidate the risk profiles of Korean patients with <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina.</b> Subjects and Methods：The risk profiles were analyzed in 181 patients with <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> (VA), 1533 patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary angiography at Samsung Seoul Hospital, and 455 normal control subjects, sex and age matched to the VA group and selected from the Health Promotion Center of Samsung Seoul Hos-pital. Results：The male to female ratio was significantly higher in the VA group (4. 6 ： 1) than the obstr-uctive CAD group (2. 7 ： 1). The {{mean age of the}} VA group (52. 2 ± 10. 7 years) was significantly younger than {{the mean age of the}} obstructive CAD group (59. 0 ± 10. 6 years) (p< 0. 01). Additionally, the smoking rate was significantly higher in the VA group (49. 2 %) as compared with the obstructive CAD group (43. 1 %) (p< 0. 01). Other major risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were significantly more prevalent in the obstructive CAD group than the VA group. Among the obstructive CAD group, a subgroup of Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) showed a significantly higher smoking rate (59. 3 %) as compared with VA group (49. 2 %) (p< 0. 01). Conclusion：The VA group showed a higher prevalence in males and younger subjects as compared with the obstructive CAD group, and smoking appeared to be the most important ris...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis {{study was}} an observational, multicenter {{registry}} to determine clinical characteristics and 24 -month {{prognosis of patients}} who underwent intracoronary ergonovine provocation tests. BackgroundThe clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients who underwent the ergonovine provocation for <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> were not fully elucidated. MethodsA total of 2, 129 patients in the VA-KOREA (<b>Vasospastic</b> <b>Angina</b> in Korea) registry were classified into positive (n = 454), intermediate (n = 982), and negative (n = 693) groups by intracoronary ergonovine provocation tests. The 24 -month incidences of cardiac death, new-onset arrhythmia, and acute coronary syndrome were determined (mean 26. 7 ± 8. 8 months). ResultsThe number of smokers, frequency of angina before angiography, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and triglyceride {{were higher in the}} positive group than in other groups. The clinical characteristics of the intermediate and the negative groups were very similar. In the positive group, the incidences of diffuse, focal, and mixed spasm were 65. 9 %, 23. 6 %, and 10. 6 %. Coronary spasm was more frequently provoked on atherosclerotic segments. The 24 -month incidences of cardiac death, arrhythmia, and acute coronary syndrome were low (0. 9 %, 1. 6 %, and 1. 9 %, respectively) in the positive group, and there was no cardiac death in the intermediate group (p = 0. 02). In the positive group, frequent angina, current smoking, and multivessel spasm were independent predictors for adverse events. ConclusionsThe 24 -month prognosis of the positive group in the intracoronary ergonovine provocation test was relatively worse than that of the intermediate group. More intensive clinical attention should be paid to <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> patients with high-risk factors including frequent angina before angiography, current smoking, and multivessel spasm...|$|E
40|$|Although {{diabetes}} mellitus {{is one of}} the established risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), the role of insulin resistance in the development of CAD has not been studied adequately. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the relationship between insulin resistance and the individual types of CAD. One hundred and twenty-seven patients with chest pain and 10 control patients without evidence of CAD were enrolled in this study. All patients with chest pain received cardiac catheterization, and were diagnosed as having cardiological syndrome X (n= 17), vasospas- tic angina pectoris (n= 37), or CAD with coronary artery stenosis (n= 73). The insulin sensitivity was assessed by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (EHC) method, as well as oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). M-value, the mean glucose infusion rate during EHC study, was used as an index of insulin resistance. M-values of patients with either <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> pectoris or CAD with coronary artery stenosis were significantly lower than those of control patients, while no difference was noted between patients with car- diological syndrome X and control patients. Insulin areas of OGTT of CAD patients with coronary artery stenosis were significantly higher than those of control patients and patients with <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina.</b> The ratio of insulin area to glucose area in CAD patients with coronary artery stenosis was significantly lower than in control patients and patients with <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina,</b> while no difference was noted between patients with cardiological syndrome X and control patients. These findings suggest that insulin resistance plays an important role in the development of both coronary arteriosclerosis and coronary vasospasm, but not of cardiological syn- drome X...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. : This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether the location of coronary spastic activity may change over time in patients with persistent variant angina. Background. : Although electrocardiographic studies have provided indirect evidence to indicate that the location of ischemia may change in patients with variant angina, it has not been tested by quantitative angiography whether the location of vasospastic activity may change over time. Methods. : Paired ergonovine provocation tests and coronary angiography were performed at a mean (±SD) interval of 43 ± 13 months apart in patients with persistent symptoms of <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> in the absence of significant atherosclerosis. A total of 87 spastic and nonspastic segments of 87 major vessels in 29 patients were analyzed by quantitative angiography at baseline, after the administration of ergonovine and after isosorbide dinitrate at the initial and follow-up tests. Results. : In 13 patients (group 1), coronary spasm was observed in the same 16 coronary segments at both the initial and follow-up ergonovine provocation tests. In 16 patients (group 2), the following angiographic changes occurred between the initial and follow-up tests in 48 major vessels: Of the 23 segments that developed spasm at the initial test, 10 did not have spasm at the follow-up test; of the 25 vessels that did not demonstrate spasm on the initial test, 12 demonstrated spasm on the follow-up test (a new site of spasm). Thus, in 22 (46 %) of 48 vessels, fluctuation of spastic location was observed at follow-up. Conclusions. : Quantitative coronary angiography and repeated ergonovine tests revealed that some patients with persistent <b>vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> demonstrate fluctuation of vasospastic location, whereas others exhibit a fixed location of vasospasm. <b>Vasospastic</b> <b>angina</b> may not only be a transient disease restricted in location, but may also be a persistent and variable condition involving multiple vessels over many years...|$|E
