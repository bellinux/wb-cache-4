40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{concerns}} {{the case of}} the insured loan based on an amortization schedule at <b>variable</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Basing on the cash flow structure, the aim is to evaluate the mathematical provision of a portfolio in a fair value approach. In this environment, the complexity of a life insurance contract management practically involves the choice of the most suitable mortality table and discounting process; in the paper the tool is treated in a stochastic scenario for <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and in random hypotheses for the mortality rates. The amortization schedule used for the loan repayment is considered at <b>variable</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> hooked at opportune rate indexes. A numerical application of the model is presented and a comparison between the behaviour of the fair values of the insured loan portfolio reserve in the two cases of an amortization schedule at fixed and at <b>variable</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> is reported. The fair reserve sensitivity to the changes of the amortization <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is studied and showed with illustrations...|$|R

50|$|The Federal Loan Consolidation Program {{was created}} in 1986.

50|$|To hedge {{costs on}} the sale of <b>variable</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> bonds, which can rise and fall with the market, local governments, such as Baltimore, {{purchased}} interest rate swaps which exchange a <b>variable</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> for a fixed interest rate. In a swap deal, when the interest rate rises, the swap seller pays the local government the increased cost on the bond, while when the interest rate falls, the swap seller saves and pays the local government the decreased cost on the bond. The interest rate swap mechanism generally works well, however, between 2007 and 2010 the payments to local governments on their swaps artificially decreased but the cost on their bonds remained at actual market rates. This was because most interest rate swaps are linked to the Libor interest rate, while municipal bond rates are linked to the SIFMA Municipal Bond Index interest rate. During the financial crisis the two benchmark rates decoupled. Municipalities continued to pay on their bonds at the actual market Sifma rate but were paid on their interest rate swaps at the artificially lower Libor rate.|$|E

50|$|<b>Interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{and loan}} terms are {{set by the}} {{financial}} institution that underwrites the loan, typically based on the perceived risk that the borrower may be delinquent or in default of payments of the loan. The underwriting decision {{is complicated by the}} fact that students often do not have a credit history that would indicate creditworthiness. As a result, <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> may vary considerably across lenders, and some loans have <b>variable</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R
50|$|For example, party B makes {{periodic}} interest payments to party A {{based on a}} <b>variable</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> of LIBOR +70 basis points.

The first rate is called variable because it is reset {{at the beginning of}} each interest calculation period to the then current reference rate, such as LIBOR. In reality, the actual rate received by A and B is slightly lower due to a bank taking a spread.|$|E
50|$|Municipalities {{began using}} {{interest}} rate swaps to hedge their municipal bond sales in the late 1990s. At this time, investment bankers began offering local governments {{a way to save}} money on the sale of municipal bonds. The banks suggested instead of selling fixed interest rate bonds that local governments sell <b>variable</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> bonds which typically have interest rates as much as one percentage point lower than fixed interest rate bonds. For a municipal government this could mean saving as much as $1 million a year on the sale of a $100 million bond.|$|E
5000|$|Capped rate - a <b>variable</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> {{but there}} is also a {{guarantee}} that the interest rate will not rise above a stated maximum. In order to provide this, the lender would probably need to purchase a derivative contract to protect itself against market interest rates rising above the cap, and would need to pass the cost of this on to the borrower. Sometimes there is also a collar, i.e. a stated minimum rate as well as a maximum. Capped rates are often offered over periods similar to fixed rates, e.g. 2, 3, 4 or 5 years.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{specific}} difference between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). A HELOC is a line of revolving credit with an adjustable interest rate whereas a home equity loan is a one time lump-sum loan, often with a fixed interest rate. With a HELOC the borrower can choose when and how often to borrow against the equity in the property, with the lender setting an initial limit to the credit line based on criteria {{similar to those used}} for closed-end loans. Like the closed-end loan, {{it may be possible to}} borrow up to an amount equal to the value of the home, minus any liens. These lines of credit are available up to 30 years, usually at a <b>variable</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> The minimum monthly payment can be as low as only the interest that is due.Typically, the interest rate is based on the prime rate plus a margin.|$|E
5000|$|After the referendum, new {{negotiations}} commenced. On 16 February 2011, the Icelandic parliament {{agreed to}} a repayment deal with the votes 44 for and 16 against, formally entitled Act 13/2011 but more {{commonly referred to as}} the Icesave bill 3. The third version of the Icesave bill entailed new terms and conditions for repayment of the full and remaining Icesave debt to UK and Netherlands, throughout a period stretching from one to 30 years starting from 2016 (with the length depending on how much time Iceland would need to repay its remaining obligations), to the sound of a fixed constant interest rate at 3.2% for 2009-15, which then ultimately would be substituted by a <b>variable</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> for the years beyond. Another improvement compared to the previous Icesave bills, was that it included an interest rate moratorium (rate being fixed to 0%) for the first three quarters of 2009. The yearly repayment amount would also be capped at the lowest of these two ceilings: Maximum 1.3% of Icelands GDP (i.e. €0.13bn in 2011), or maximum 5% of the total Icelandic government revenue from the previous year (i.e. €0.23bn in 2011). A minimum repayment was however also guaranteed by the mutual agreement, as it could never be less compared to a situation with traditional amortisation over 30 years. Finally the new deal also in practise had removed the demand for equal footing for all [...] "priority claims" [...] towards the Landsbanki receivership, meaning that it was now likely the receivership would repay 100% of the €4bn of owed minimum deposit guarantees during 2011-15, with the accrued interests being the only remaining responsibility for the Icelandic state subsequently to guarantee and cover. It was noted in the bill, that the expected remaining liabilities for the Icelandic state would now only amount to ISK 47bn (€0.24bn) in 2016, meaning it was now likely for the Icelandic state to repay all the remaining liabilities after only two years of amortisation in 2016 and 2017. The Icelandic president however once again refused to sign the new deal on 20 February 2011, and thus triggered a new Icesave referendum to be called. A referendum was held on 9 April 2011, asking the Icelandic electorate to vote yes/no for Icesave bill 3. A group of 15 concerned citizens organised under the name of Advice.is and campaigned for a No in Iceland and internationally.|$|E
