5|$|Tetrabenazine was {{approved}} in 2008 {{for treatment of}} chorea in Huntington's disease in the US. Other drugs that help to reduce chorea include neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. Compounds such as amantadine or remacemide are still under investigation but have shown preliminary positive results. Hypokinesia and rigidity, especially in juvenile cases, can be treated with antiparkinsonian drugs, and myoclonic hyperkinesia can be treated with <b>valproic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> may cause premature growth plate ossification in children and adolescents, resulting in decreased height. <b>Valproic</b> <b>acid</b> can also cause mydriasis, a dilation of the pupils. There {{is evidence}} that shows <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> may increase the chance of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder. Studies have shown this risk of PCOS is higher in women with epilepsy compared to those with bipolar disorder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Valproic</b> <b>acid</b> and {{valnoctamide}} both inhibit microsomal epoxide hydrolase (MEH), {{the enzyme}} {{responsible for the}} breakdown of carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide into inactive metabolites. By inhibiting MEH, <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> and valnoctamide cause a build-up of the active metabolite, prolonging the effects of carbamazepine and delaying its excretion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Valproic</b> <b>acid</b> {{has been}} found to {{directly}} stimulate androgen biosynthesis in the gonads via inhibition of histone deacetylases and has been associated with hyperandrogenism in women and increased 4-androstenedione levels in men. High rates of polycystic ovary syndrome and menstrual disorders have also been observed in women treated with <b>valproic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
25|$|Depakote tablets are {{a mixture}} of sodium valproate and <b>valproic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Valproic</b> <b>acid</b> has a {{black box}} warning for hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, and fetal abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Valproic</b> <b>acid</b> is a {{branched}} short-chain {{fatty acid}} and a derivative of valeric acid.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{amounts of}} <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> {{can result in}} sleepiness, tremor, stupor, {{respiratory}} depression, coma, metabolic acidosis, and death. In general, serum or plasma <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations are {{in a range of}} 20–100mg/l during controlled therapy, but may reach 150–1500mg/l following acute poisoning. Monitoring of the serum level is often accomplished using commercial immunoassay techniques, although some laboratories employ gas or liquid chromatography.|$|E
25|$|Valproate {{exists in}} two main {{molecular}} variants: sodium valproate and <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> without sodium (often implied by simply valproate). A mixture {{between these two}} is termed semisodium valproate. It is unclear whether there is any difference in efficacy between these variants, except {{from the fact that}} about 10% more of sodium valproate is needed than <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> without sodium to compensate for the sodium itself.|$|E
25|$|<b>Valproic</b> <b>acid</b> {{has been}} found to be an {{antagonist}} of the androgen and progesterone receptors, and hence as a nonsteroidal antiandrogen and antiprogestogen, at concentrations much lower than therapeutic serum levels. In addition, the drug has been identified as a potent aromatase inhibitor, and suppresses estrogen concentrations. These actions are likely to be involved in the reproductive endocrine disturbances seen with <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment.|$|E
25|$|Bipolar disorder: lithium carbonate, {{antipsychotics}} (like olanzapine or quetiapine), anticonvulsants (like <b>valproic</b> <b>acid,</b> lamotrigine and topiramate).|$|E
25|$|Decitabine: Complete {{response}} rate reported {{as high as}} 43%. A phase I study has shown efficacy in AML when decitabine is combined with <b>valproic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E

25|$|Based upon five case reports, <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> {{may have}} {{efficacy}} in controlling {{the symptoms of}} levodopa-induced DDS that arise {{from the use of}} levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|Based upon five case reports, <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> {{may have}} {{efficacy}} in controlling {{the symptoms of}} the dopamine dysregulation syndrome that arise from the treatment of Parkinson's disease with levodopa.|$|E
25|$|<b>Valproic</b> <b>acid,</b> one of {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed anticonvulsants that is also used to treat certain psychological conditions, is a known inhibitor of folic acid, and as such, has been shown to cause neural tube defects and cases of spina bifida and cognitive impairment in the newborn. Because of this considerable risk, those mothers who must continue to use <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> or its derivatives during pregnancy to control their condition (as opposed to stopping the drug or switching to another drug or to a lesser dose) should take folic acid supplements under the direction and guidance of their health care providers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Valproic</b> <b>acid</b> (VPA) is {{an organic}} weak acid. The {{conjugate}} base is valproate. The {{sodium salt of}} the acid is sodium valproate and a coordination complex of the two is known as divalproex sodium.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} exactly how valproate works. Proposed {{mechanisms}} include affecting GABA levels, blocking voltage-gated sodium channels, and inhibiting histone deacetylases. <b>Valproic</b> <b>acid</b> is a branched short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) made from valeric acid.|$|E
25|$|Ethosuximide, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Zarontin among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat absence seizures. It may be used by itself or with other antiseizure medications such as <b>valproic</b> <b>acid.</b> Ethosuximide is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to other antiepileptic drugs, at present {{there is little}} favorable evidence for salivary therapeutic drug monitoring. Salivary levels of <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> correlate poorly with serum levels, partly due to valproate's weak acid property (pKa of 4.9).|$|E
25|$|Cells produce GHB by {{reduction}} of succinic semialdehyde via succinic semialdehyde reductase (SSR). This enzyme appears to be induced by cAMP levels, meaning substances that elevate cAMP, such as forskolin and vinpocetine, may increase GHB synthesis and release. Conversely, endogeneous GHB production in those taking <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> will be inhibited via inhibition of the conversion from succinic acid semialdehyde to GHB. It is important to note, however, that direct administration of GHB or endogenous GHB already present in the body will not be affected by <b>valproic</b> <b>acid.</b> People with the disorder known as succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, also known as γ-hydroxybutyric aciduria, have elevated levels of GHB in their urine, blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
25|$|It {{also has}} histone deacetylase-inhibiting effects. The {{inhibition}} of histone deacetylase, by promoting more transcriptionally active chromatin structures, likely presents the epigenetic mechanism for regulation {{of many of}} the neuroprotective effects attributed to <b>valproic</b> <b>acid.</b> Intermediate molecules mediating these effects include VEGF, BDNF, and GDNF.|$|E
25|$|Because of valerian's {{historical}} {{use as a}} sedative, antiseptic, anticonvulsant, migraine treatment, {{and pain}} reliever, most basic science research has been directed at the interaction of valerian constituents with the GABA receptor. Many studies remain inconclusive and all require clinical validation. The mechanism of action of valerian in general, and as a mild sedative in particular, has not been fully elucidated. However, some of the GABA-analogs, particularly valerenic acids as components of the essential oil along with other semivolatile sesquiterpenoids, generally {{are believed to have}} some affinity for the GABAA receptor, a class of receptors on which benzodiazepines are known to act. Valeric acid, which is responsible for the typical odor of mostly older valerian roots, does not have any sedative properties. Valeric acid is related to <b>valproic</b> <b>acid,</b> a widely prescribed anticonvulsant; <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> is a derivative of valeric acid.|$|E
25|$|Key {{studies using}} such {{strategy}} {{were conducted in}} 2008. Melton et al. studied the effects of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor <b>valproic</b> <b>acid.</b> They found that it increased reprogramming efficiency 100-fold (compared to Yamanaka’s traditional transcription factor method). The researchers proposed that this compound was mimicking the signaling that is usually caused by the transcription factor c-Myc.|$|E
25|$|Valproate (VPA), and its <b>valproic</b> <b>acid,</b> sodium valproate, and {{valproate semisodium}} forms, are {{medications}} primarily {{used to treat}} epilepsy and bipolar disorder and to prevent migraine headaches. It is useful {{for the prevention of}} seizures in those with absence seizures, partial seizures, and generalized seizures. It can be given intravenously or by mouth. Long and short acting formulation of tablets exist.|$|E
25|$|Smoking {{is known}} to {{increase}} levels of liver enzymes that break down drugs and toxins. That means that drugs cleared by these enzymes are cleared more quickly in smokers, which may result in the drugs not working. Specifically, levels of CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 are induced: substrates for 1A2 include caffeine and tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline; substrates for 2A6 include the anticonvulsant, <b>valproic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Valproic</b> <b>acid</b> (VPA) is a {{treatment}} for epilepsy, migraines, and bipolar disorder that {{has been linked to}} many conditions including autism. An animal model of autism exists in which pregnant rats are given VPA. The offspring have traits similar to those of humans with autism. Shortly after birth, these animals exhibit decreased excitability and increased NMDA currents. These effects are corrected at later stages in life. The changes in intrinsic excitability in these animals helped to offset the effects of increased NMDA currents on network activity, a form of homeostatic plasticity. It is believed that this helps mediate the detrimental effects that the increased NMDA currents would have.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines are the {{preferred}} initial treatment after which typically phenytoin is given. Possible benzodiazepines include intravenous lorazepam {{as well as}} intramuscular injections of midazolam. A number of other medications may be used if these are not effective such as <b>valproic</b> <b>acid,</b> phenobarbital, propofol, or ketamine. Intubation {{may be required to}} help maintain the person's airway. Between 10 and 30% of people who have status epilepticus die within 30 days. The underlying cause, the person's age, and the length of the seizure are important factors in the outcome. Status epilepticus occurs in up to 40 per 100,000 people per year. It makes up about 1% of people who visit the emergency department.|$|E
25|$|Some {{medications}} {{are commonly}} associated with pancreatitis, most commonly corticosteroids such as prednisolone, but also including the HIV medications didanosine and pentamidine, diuretics, the anticonvulsant <b>valproic</b> <b>acid,</b> the chemotherapeutic agents L-asparaginase and azathioprine, estrogen by way of increased blood triglycerides, and antihyperglycemic agents like metformin, vildagliptin, and sitagliptin. It may be noted here that the drugs used to treat conditions that are themselves associated with increased events of pancreatitis may also be incidentally linked to pancreatitis. Examples include statins in dyslipidemia and DPP-4 inhibitors in diabetes. According to the Food and Drug Administration's MedWatch Surveillance System and Published Reports Atypical, atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine can also cause pancreatitis.|$|E
25|$|In March 1989, Coulter, Huguenard and Prince {{showed that}} {{ethosuximide}} and dimethadione, both effective anti-absence agents, reduced low-threshold Ca2+ currents in T-type calcium channels in freshly removed thalamic neurons. In June {{of that same}} year, they also found the mechanism of this reduction to be voltage-dependent, using acutely dissociated neurons of rats and guinea pigs; it was also noted that <b>valproic</b> <b>acid,</b> which is also used in absence seizures, did not do that. The next year, they showed that anticonvulsant succinimides did this and that the pro-convulsant ones did not. The first part was supported by Kostyuk et al. in 1992, who reported a substantial reduction in current in dorsal root ganglia at concentrations ranging from 7 µmol/L to 1mmol/L.|$|E
25|$|By 1980, {{primidone}} {{was seen}} as not worth mentioning as an option for childhood temporal lobe epilepsy by doctors in the United Kingdom. In January 1981, Dr. O'Brien and colleagues reported that primidone had {{a positive effect on}} the essential tremor of one of their patients. This led them to initiate a twenty-person prospective study. Twelve of the participants responded well. By 1984, <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> was the drug of choice for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and not the equally effective primidone. However, as late as 1985, primidone was {{still one of the most}} widely used anticonvulsants. At the close of the 1980s, primidone was still the preferred anticonvulsant for complex partial seizures in Germany. In 1989, Dainippon Pharmaceutical launched Exegran (zonisamide), the first new, chemically unique, non-benzodiazepine anticonvulsant in decades.|$|E
25|$|Carbamazepine has a {{potential}} for drug interactions; caution {{should be used in}} combining other medicines with it, including other antiepileptics and mood stabilizers. Lower levels of carbamazepine are seen when administrated with phenobarbital, phenytoin, or primidone, which can result in breakthrough seizure activity. Carbamazepine, as a CYP450 inducer, may increase clearance of many drugs, decreasing their concentration in the blood to subtherapeutic levels and reducing their desired effects. Drugs that are more rapidly metabolized with carbamazepine include warfarin, lamotrigine, phenytoin, theophylline, and <b>valproic</b> <b>acid.</b> Drugs that decrease the metabolism of carbamazepine or otherwise increase its levels include erythromycin, cimetidine, propoxyphene, and calcium channel blockers. Carbamazepine also increases the metabolism of the hormones in birth control pills and can reduce their effectiveness, potentially leading to unexpected pregnancies. As a drug that induces cytochrome P450 enzymes, it accelerates elimination of many benzodiazepines and decreases their action.|$|E
25|$|It {{is also a}} {{moderate}} inhibitor of CYP2D6 and also a substrate for CYP2D6 and hence can inhibit its own metabolism. It can also inhibit the clearance of CYP2D6 substrates such as dextromethorphan and hence also potentiate their effects. Other drugs like codeine and tamoxifen which require CYP2D6-mediated activation into their respective active metabolites may have their therapeutic effects attenuated. Likewise CYP2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine or fluoxetine can reduce chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase serum levels of chlorpromazine and hence potentially also its adverse effects. Chlorpromazine also reduces phenytoin levels and increases <b>valproic</b> <b>acid</b> levels. It also reduces propranolol clearance and antagonises the therapeutic effects of antidiabetic agents, levodopa (a Parkinson's medication. This is likely {{due to the fact}} that chlorpromazine antagonises the D2 receptor which is one of the receptors dopamine, a levodopa metabolite, activates), amfetamines and anticoagulants. It may also interact with anticholinergic drugs such as orphenadrine to produce hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).|$|E
500|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of small, usually heritable, {{molecular}} modifications—or [...] "tags"—that bind DNA and modify gene expression levels. Targeting these tags with drugs can kill cancer cells. Early-stage research in NSCLC using drugs aimed at epigenetic modifications shows that blocking more than one of these tags can kill cancer cells with fewer side effects. Studies also show that giving patients these drugs before standard treatment can improve its effectiveness. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate how well these drugs kill lung cancer cells in humans. Several drugs that target epigenetic mechanisms are in development. Histone deacetylase inhibitors in development include <b>valproic</b> <b>acid,</b> vorinostat, belinostat, panobinostat, entinostat, and romidepsin. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in development include decitabine, azacytidine, and hydralazine.|$|E
