40|$|Abstract Background This {{prospective}} randomized blinded {{clinical study}} aimed {{to investigate the}} potential of <b>vedaprofen</b> for preventive analgesia, comparing its analgesic effects with ketoprofen administered post-operatively in dogs undergoing maxillectomy or mandibulectomy. Results Pain control was effective and rescue analgesia was not necessary in any group. Pain scores {{were not significantly different}} between groups. The respiratory rate and rectal temperature were decreased in all groups at extubation until 6  hours post-extubation compared to baseline. Cortisol and epinephrine levels were increased only at 0. 5  hours after extubation in all groups compared to baseline. Conclusions <b>Vedaprofen</b> did not present any preventive analgesic effect. Pre- and postoperative <b>vedaprofen</b> were as effective as ketoprofen for postoperative pain control. FAPESPINCo...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the authors aimed {{to compare the}} {{efficiency}} of carprofen, ketoprofen and <b>vedaprofen</b> for alleviating postoperative pain in bitches submitted to ovariohysterectomy (OH). Pre- and postoperative assessment of pain was made using serum levels of cortisol and glucose, the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the University of Melbourne pain scale (UMPS) in twenty-one bitches undergoing OH. Dogs {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three groups: <b>vedaprofen</b> at 0. 5 mg kg- 1, carprofen at 2. 2 mg kg- 1 or ketoprofen at 2. 2 mg kg- 1. All analgesics were given orally 2 hour before surgery. Assessments were made before surgery and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-extubation. No dog of this study required additional doses of analgesics. There were no significant differences on serum cortisol and glucose concentrations among groups or from basal values, excepted one hour after extubation. No significant differences on pain scores were observed. It was concluded that <b>vedaprofen</b> provided as good a level of postoperative analgesia as carprofen and ketoprofen...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) possess antibacterial properties with an unknown mechanism. We describe the in vitro antibacterial properties of the NSAIDs carprofen, bromfenac, and <b>vedaprofen,</b> and show that these NSAIDs inhibit the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III β subunit, an essential interaction hub {{that acts as a}} mobile tether on DNA for many essential partner proteins in DNA replication and repair. Crystal structures show that the three NSAIDs bind to the sliding clamp at a common binding site required for partner binding. Inhibition of interaction of the clamp loader and/or the replicative polymerase α subunit with the sliding clamp is demonstrated using an in vitro DNA replication assay. NSAIDs thus present promising lead scaffolds for novel antibacterial agents targeting the sliding clamp...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effects of {{treatment}} with either intra-articular medication, NSAIDs, or both, in horses that suffered from (aseptic) osteoarthritis, tenosynovitis or bursitis. Horses that met several criteria were included in the study. Patient data files (Vetware) of 120 lame horses that were investigated at the Department of Equine Sciences of Utrecht University were collected and evaluated: 42 horses were treated with orally administered NSAIDs only (<b>vedaprofen</b> or meloxicam), 39 with intrathecally administered corticosteroids only (methylprednisolone acetate, triamcinolone acetonide or dexamethasone) and 39 horses received orally administered NSAIDs as well as intrathecally administered corticosteroids. 30 % of horses treated with NSAIDs had a positive outcome. 33 % of horses treated with corticosteroids and 51 % of horses treated with both NSAIDs and corticosteroids had a positive outcome. Differences between these groups were not statistically significant (P > 0. 05). Outcome of these results was not influenced by the results of diagnostic imaging. It was concluded that in the present study there was a tendency that a combination of intrathecally administered corticosteroids with orally administered NSAIDs resulted in the best outcome, but it did not lead to scientific evidence that intrathecally administered corticosteroids with or without orally administered NSAIDs had a better prognosis...|$|E
40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{reliable}} LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous confirmation of twelve non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in bovine milk {{was developed and}} fully validated {{in accordance with the}} European Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC. The validation scheme was built in accordance with the MRLs or target analytical levels (EU-CRL recommended concentrations and detection capabilities) of the analytes, except for diclofenac for which the lower level of validation achieved was 0. 5 μg kg(- 1) whereas its MRL is 0. 1 μg kg(- 1). The NSAIDs investigated were as follows: phenylbutazone (PBZ), oxyphenylbutazone (OPB), naproxen (NP), mefenamic acid (MF), <b>vedaprofen</b> (VDP), flunixin (FLU), 5 -hydroxyflunixin (FLU-OH), tolfenamic acid (TLF), meloxicam (MLX), diclofenac (DC), carprofen (CPF) and ketoprofen (KTP). Several extraction procedures had been investigated during the development phase. Finally, the best results were obtained with a procedure using only methanol as the extraction solvent, with an evaporation step included and no further purification. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a C 18 analytical column and the run was split in 2 segments. Matrix effects were also investigated. Data acquisition implemented for the confirmatory purpose was performed by monitoring 2 MRM transitions per analyte under the negative electrospray mode. Mean relative recoveries ranged from 94. 7 % to 110. 0 %, with their coefficients of variation lying between 2. 9 % and 14. 7 %. Analytical limits expressed in terms of decision limits (CCα) were evaluated between 0. 69 μg kg(- 1) (FLU) and 27. 54 μg kg(- 1) (VDP) for non-MRL compounds, and at 0. 10 (DC), 15. 37 (MLX), 45. 08 (FLU-OH), and 62. 96 μg kg(- 1) (TLF) for MRL compounds. The validation results proved that the method is suitable for the screening and confirmatory steps as implemented for the French monitoring plan for NSAID residue control in bovine milk...|$|E
40|$|Summary Opioids have an {{unjustified}} {{reputation for}} causing mania in cats, but with refinements in dosing {{they are now}} used successfully in this species. The mu-opioid agonists are generally considered the best analgesics. Morphine (0. 1 e 0. 3 mg/kg) is effective in a clinical setting. Methadone (up to 0. 5 mg/kg) has a similar profile to morphine. Pethidine (Demerol, meperidine; 2 e 5 mg/kg) is a useful anal-gesic with a faster onset but shorter duration of action than morphine. Oxymor-phone and hydromorphone (0. 05 e 0. 1 mg/kg) are widely used in the USA. These opioids are more potent (up to 10 times), and longer acting than morphine in cats. Butorphanol (0. 1 e 0. 4 mg/kg) is a mu-opioid antagonist that produces its analgesic actions through kappa agonist activity. It rapidly reaches a ceiling effect, is short acting and is a weaker analgesic than pure mu opioids. Buprenorphine (0. 01 e 0. 02 mg/kg), a partial mu-agonist, {{is the most popular}} opioid used in small animal prac-tice in the UK, other parts of Europe, Australia and South Africa. In clinical studies it has produced better analgesia than several other opioids and appears to be highly suitable for perioperative pain management in cats. NSAIDs are also used in cats for pain management, although cats metabolise these differently from other spe-cies. With appropriate dosing, carprofen (1 e 4 mg/kg) and meloxicam (0. 3 mg/kg) have proved highly effective with few side effects. The use of ketoprofen (2 mg/ kg), tolfenamic acid (4 mg/kg) and <b>vedaprofen</b> (0. 5 mg/kg) has been reported in cats. Other less traditional analgesics such as ketamine, medetomidine and local anaesthetics are also used for clinical pain management. The transmucosal, trans-dermal and epidural routes offer novel methods for administration of analgesic drugs and have considerable potential for improving techniques in feline pain management...|$|E
