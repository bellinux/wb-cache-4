50|$|It is {{important}} not to confuse IFR with IMC. A significant amount of IFR flying is conducted in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). Anytime a flight is operating in VMC and in a volume of airspace in which <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> can operate, the crew is responsible for seeing and avoiding VFR traffic; however, because the flight is conducted under Instrument Flight Rules, ATC still provides separation services from other IFR traffic, and can in many cases also advise the crew of the location of <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> near the flight path.|$|E
50|$|Class D: Operations may be {{conducted}} under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. All flights {{are subject to}} ATC clearance (country-specific variations notwithstanding). Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated from each other, and are given traffic information in respect of VFR flights. Flights operating under <b>VFR</b> are given <b>traffic</b> information in respect of all other flights.|$|R
50|$|Class C: Operations may be {{conducted}} under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. All aircraft {{are subject to}} ATC clearance (country-specific variations notwithstanding). Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated {{from each other and}} from flights operating under VFR, but VFR flights are not separated from each other. Flights operating under <b>VFR</b> are given <b>traffic</b> information in respect of other VFR flights.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} depart and {{approach}} operations of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) {{in one of}} the most challenging scenarios: when flying under Visual Flight Rules (VFR). Inspired by some existing procedures for (manned) general aviation, some automatic and predefined procedures for UAS are proposed. Hence, standardized paths to specific waypoints close to the airport are defined for depart operations, just before starting the navigation phase. Conversely, and for the approach maneuvers, it is foreseen a first integration into a holding pattern near the landing runway (ideally above it) followed by a standard <b>VFR</b> airfield <b>traffic</b> pattern. This paper discusses the advantages of these operations which aim at minimizing possible conflicts with other existing aircraft while reducing the Pilot-in-Command workload. Finally, some preliminary simulations are shown where these procedures have been successfully tested with simulated surrounding traffic...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{execution}} of a contact approach, the pilot is responsible for obstruction clearance, but ATC will still provide separation from other IFR or Special <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic.</b> [...] If radar service is being received, it will automatically terminate when the pilot is instructed to change to the airport's advisory frequency.|$|E
50|$|Quisqueyana {{was founded}} in 1962, aiming at the Dominican <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> within the Americas and to Europe. It became the second largest airline of the Dominican Republic, but {{ultimately}} lost the competition with Dominicana. In 1978, the airline suspended all flights and was shut down, though technically its airline license stayed valid until 1993.|$|E
50|$|Though SID {{procedures}} are primarily designed for IFR traffic to join airways, {{air traffic control}} at busy airports can request that <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> also follows such a procedure so that aircraft separation can be more easily maintained. Usually VFR pilots will be given radar vectors corresponding to the SID lateral route with different altitude restrictions.|$|E
50|$|A contact {{approach}} {{that may be}} asked for by the pilot (but not offered by ATC) in which the pilot has 1 SM flight visibility and is clear of clouds {{and is expected to}} be able to maintain those conditions {{all the way to the}} airport. Obstruction clearances and <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> avoidance become the pilot's responsibility.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{area has}} {{five or six}} {{individual}} sectors that are worked by controllers. Southern California Tracon {{is responsible for the}} handling of aircraft departing and arriving these airports, generally below 16,000 feet. SCT is responsible for sequencing inbound, separating from crossing and <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic,</b> and departing traffic. Separation is achieved by vectoring traffic and assigning altitudes.|$|E
5000|$|A {{military}} operations area (MOA) is [...] "airspace established outside Class A airspace to separate or segregate certain nonhazardous military activities from IFR Traffic {{and to identify}} for <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> where these activities are conducted." [...] (14 CFR §1.1, U.S.A.) Similar structures exist under international flight standards. These are designed for routine training or testing maneuvers. Areas near actual combat or other military emergencies are generally designated as restricted airspace. See Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR).|$|E
50|$|Generally, VMC {{requires}} greater {{visibility and}} cloud clearance in controlled airspace than in uncontrolled airspace. In uncontrolled airspace {{there is less}} risk of a VFR aircraft colliding with an instrument flight rules (IFR) aircraft emerging from a cloud, so aircraft are permitted to fly closer to clouds. An exception to this rule is class B airspace, in which ATC separates <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> from all other traffic (VFR or IFR), which is why in class B airspace lower cloud clearance is permitted.|$|E
50|$|March 9, 1967, TWA Flight 553, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15 jet {{airliner}} {{operated by}} Trans World Airlines, {{en route to}} Dayton when it collided with a Beechcraft Baron over Urbana, Ohio. Visual flight rules (VFR) were in effect {{at the time of}} the accident. However, the uncontrolled <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> around Dayton airspace contributed to, also with high rate of descent of the DC-9 prompted, Federal Aviation Administration's decision to create Terminal Control Areas or TCAs (either called Class B airspace and Class C airspace) coordination.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s banner-towing {{started to}} become widely {{used as a}} {{cost-effective}} way of bringing {{a message to the}} attention of targeted groups of people. There were very few restrictions, the airspace was not nearly as tightly regulated as to-day. <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic,</b> meaning aircraft navigating solely by visual reference, could even fly into some major airports without using two-way radio, using special air corridors and getting landing-, take-off and taxi instructions by coloured light signals using an [...] "Aldis" [...] lamp from the control tower.|$|E
50|$|The NTSB {{recommended}} that the FAA revise the procedures for ATC facilities {{in the area to}} facilitate the process for <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> that wishes to transit Class B airspace.

50|$|It is {{important}} to note, {{that there is no}} official means of navigation for IR or VR routes. A VR route may be flown visually, and an IR route may be flown completely heads down (although this is rarely the case). Although ATC provides deconfliction for IR Routes, VR routes are flown completely independent of external separation. Since <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> does not legally have to be squawking, this provides for a serious hazard to navigation. The FAA claims the military maximizes use of IR routes for this purpose, however the vast majority of military training flights on MTRs are on VR routes.|$|E
5000|$|Between 15 April and 21 April 2010, Bournemouth Airport {{was closed}} to IFR Traffic {{as a result of}} the eruptions by Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland. The eruptions caused severe {{disruptions}} to services as the UK government deemed it necessary to close air space until ash ejected into the stratosphere had subsided. It was originally feared that disruptions could continue as the last eruption lasted around 16 months. [...] Services resumed on 22 April. Despite this, <b>VFR</b> <b>Traffic</b> continued and Bournemouth Airport became the busiest airport during this period as it has a large general aviation clientele.|$|E
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board in {{a report}} adopted July 15, 1970, {{released}} the following Probable Cause:The Board determines the probable cause of this accident to be the deficiencies in the collision avoidance capability of the Air Traffic Control system of the Federal Aviation Administration in a terminal area wherein there was mixed instrument flight rules (IFR) and visual flight rules (<b>VFR)</b> <b>traffic.</b> The deficiencies included the inadequacy of the see-and-avoid concept under the circumstances of this case; the technical limitations of radar in detecting all aircraft; {{and the absence of}} Federal Aviation Regulations which would provide a system of adequate separation of mixed VFR and IFR traffic in terminal areas.|$|E
50|$|Long {{established}} in the Los Angeles basin is the Los Angeles SFRA. Los Angeles International Airport is surrounded by extensive Class B airspace, which is difficult for <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> to navigate. In particular, the airport has four large runways running east/west that have airspace protection from 10,000 feet down to the surface that is 25 statute miles wide. This large swath of Class B airspace bisects Los Angeles and makes flights between the airports north of LAX and south of LAX require air traffic control to route these flights. To alleviate this load on ATC, the SFRA over LAX defines two exceptions to the Class B airspace to allow VFR aircraft to transit without control from ATC.|$|E
5000|$|VFR {{flight is}} not allowed in {{airspace}} known as class A, regardless of the meteorological conditions except after failure of two way radio communications or during declared emergencies such as <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> attempting to avoid severe weather formations. In the United States, class A airspace is measured using flight levels, and begins at FL180 up to FL600, which is about 18,000 to 60,000 feet as measured using an altimeter at standard pressure (29.92 inHg, 1013 mbar). An exception to IFR-only flying in this airspace is the occasional allowance of sailplanes within designated wave windows which may be opened by Air traffic control when high altitude flights are to be conducted into mountain Lee waves.|$|E
50|$|Flight 553 {{departed}} from Greater Pittsburgh Airport {{en route to}} Dayton Municipal Airport. After passing Columbus, Ohio, Flight 553 had been cleared to descend from Flight Level (FL) 200 (about 20000 ft above sea level) to 3000 ft. The flight was in uncontrolled airspace, but being handled by Dayton radar approach control, who advised them of uncontrolled <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> ahead and slightly to the right, and one mile away, about 18 seconds before the collision. The crew acknowledged the traffic advisory. As the airliner descended through 4500 ft at a speed of 323 knots on a southwest heading, it collided with the smaller craft, a southbound Beechcraft Baron 55. The front {{right side of the}} DC-9 hit {{the left side of the}} Beechcraft. Both aircraft fell to earth in Concord Township, a rural area northwest of the city of Urbana in Champaign County. The collision was just north of the intersection of Lippincott Road and State Route 29.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{addition}} to the program was the existence of VFR general aviation pilots in simulations. In many simulations, a number of VFR icons criss-cross the screen. Occasionally, one would call, [...] "Cherokee five five zulu with you at three thousand five hundred." [...] The player {{would have to ask}} the VFR pilot to squawk their transponder, making the VFR craft's icon bloom on the screen. This separated the calling aircraft's icon from other identical VFR icons on the screen. Within a short time frame, the player had to attach the correct ident (55Z) to the VFR aircraft. The squawked icon would only bloom for a few seconds. If too much time passed, the player had to repeat the request and try again. It becomes essential to have the sound working properly if you want to handle this <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic,</b> else it becomes necessary to scroll up/down your dialogue window to see the calls made by any VFR entering so that you may call them with their proper call sign or you can not identify them and consequently control them.|$|E
5000|$|The IFR {{flights were}} {{required}} to remain {{within the confines of}} the Los Angeles Group 1 TCA, while smaller planes {{were required to}} remain outside of the TCA, until the designated entry point, which was specified in their assigned VFR TCA arrival. In the case of GW 261, it was to remain outside of the TCA until the 10 DME fix of runway 24 right localizer, and to enter at an altitude of 1,500 feet MSL. The top of the TCA was 7,000 feet, while the base varied, depending on the distance from LAX. That mixed it in with all the other small plane <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> in the Los Angeles Basin, which did not have transponders. Most of those were not flying to LAX, so they were not in radio communication with LAX radar controllers. The only defense was the [...] "see and be seen" [...] method of collision avoidance. That deficient method of traffic separation, failed to work that day, as it has failed many other times in high density traffic areas.|$|E
50|$|Class B {{airspace}} is used {{to control}} the flow of traffic around major airports. The airspace is charted on a VFR sectional chart {{with a series of}} blue lines. Within these blue lines, the floor and the ceiling of the Class B airspace is defined. The lateral boundaries of Class B airspace are individually tailored to facilitate arriving and departing traffic operating under IFR. Class B airspace extends from the surface to generally 10000 ft MSL. In Denver, Colorado and Salt Lake City, Utah, the ceiling is at 12000 ft MSL, while in Phoenix, Arizona, the ceiling is at 9000 ft MSL. Charts must be consulted for the most current floor and ceiling information. Aircraft must establish two-way radio communication with ATC and obtain a clearance to enter Class B airspace. All aircraft operating inside or within 30 NM of Class B airspace are required to have a transponder with Mode C. The 30 NM Mode C Veil is denoted on VFR charts by a thin magenta line. <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> must remain clear of clouds and maintain 3 SM of visibility while operating within Class B airspace.|$|E
40|$|Executive summary Key findings, largely {{consistent}} with the earlier work both of Bischoff and Koenig-Lewis (2006) and the former English Tourism Council (ETC) (2002), relate specifically to (i) student-linked {{visiting friends and relatives}} (<b>VFR)</b> <b>traffic,</b> (ii) the customer journey, and (iii) future opportunities with respect to generating <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic.</b> Student-linked VFR traffic: Student-linked <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> meets the commonly accepted market segmentation criteria. It is: (i) definable; (ii) measurable; (iii) accessible; (iv) substantial; (v) congruent; and (vi) stable (Blythe, 2005). Students play a pivotal role in influencing VFR activity. They represent opinion leaders. Corroborating earlier research (Bischoff and Koenig-Lewis, 2006; ETC, 2002), this role was found to extend into five identifiable areas: (i) trip generation; (ii) accommodation selection; (iii) activity engagement; (iv) food and beverage selection; and (v) future/repeat business. 95 % of respondents in this study were overnight visitors with 79 % aged 16 - 34. 95 % of respondents indicated VFR to be their main reason for visiting Liverpool. International <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> and domestic <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> were found to exhibit different travel patterns, and to foster different needs and aspirations. They represent two separate markets and should be acknowledged as such...|$|E
40|$|LjubljanaAirport is {{the main}} and central airport of the Republicof Slovenia that serves {{the needs of the}} major part of thecountry as well as the needs of the eminent regions across theborder. Due to its {{proximity}} to the capital of Slovenia, it is ofspecial importance for the country. The traffic at Ljubljana Airportconsists of IFR and <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic.</b> In calculations, however,only IFR traffic is considered. Although the <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> participateswith a significant share in the total amount of traffic, it isso flexible that in the end, it only contributes to the overall capacityof the runway.

Take-offs can be executed in the directions 31 or 13. Both directions are considered in the calculations. The basiccalculations are done on the assumption that take-offs andlandings are executed in the same direction, that is, on runway 31. This presents a normal procedure at traffic peaks since sucha situation is clearer, easier and safer for an Air Traffic Controllerto handle.

40|$|Aim/Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore whether a full cost flight {{training}} device (FTD) was significantly better for simulator training than a low cost PC-Based Aviation Training Device (PCATD). Background: 	A quasi-transfer study was undertaken to ascertain whether a Civil Aviation Authority certified Flight Training Device (FTD) was more effective at improving pilot proficiency in the performance of a standard <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> pattern (Overhead Rejoin Procedure) than a customised low cost PCATD. Methodology: In this quasi-transfer study, a high fidelity FTD rather than an aircraft was used to test both training and transfer tasks. Ninety-three pilots were recruited to participate in the study. Contribution: The use of PCATDs is now well established for pilot training, especially for Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) skills training. However, little substantive research has been undertaken to examine their efficacy for VFR training. Findings: There was no evidence of a pre-test/post-test difference in VFR task perfor-mance between participants trained on the PCATD and the FTD, when post tested on the FTD. The use of both PCATD and FTD demonstrated signifi-cant improvements in VFR task performance compared to a control group that received no PCATD or FTD training. Recommendations for Practitioners	: We discuss the possibility that low cost PCATDs may be a viable alternative for flight schools wishing to use a flight simulator but not able to afford a FTD. Recommendation for Researchers: 	We discuss the introduction of improved low cost technologies that allow PCATDs to be used more effectively for training in VFR procedures. The development and testing of new technologies requires more research. Impact on Society: Flight training schools operate in a difficult economic environment with continued increases in the cost of aircraft maintenance, compliance costs, and aviation fuel. The increased utilisation of low cost PCATD’s especially for VFR instruction could significantly reduce the overall cost of pilot training Future Research: A new study is being undertaken to compare the effectiveness of a PCATD and a FTD at training transfer of other VFR task procedures such as forced landing training, forced landing after take-off, and low-level navigation exercises...|$|E
40|$|Flying is a {{difficult}} and complex activity that requires a significant level of attention from the pilot {{as well as a}} lengthy training period to gain sufficient competency. For issues of both cost and safety, flight simulation has been an integral part of flight training from its earliest beginnings. There {{have been a number of}} technological developments and improvements in both the level of fidelity and the training effectiveness of flight simulators. As a result, flight simulators in use today are the result of this technological, psychological, and engineering evolution. Indeed, simulator cockpits can now accurately replicate all of the functions of flight controls and instrumentation found in real aircraft. Furthermore, the development of high-resolution display systems utilising computer-generated imagery (CGI), means that flight simulators can now display very realistic terrain and environmental effects. The high cost of modern full motion flight simulators (FFSs) has meant that their use has generally been restricted to commercial airlines, military forces, and government agencies. More recently, rapid advances and decreasing costs in PC-based computer technology has enabled flight-training organisations to conduct more training with less expensive fixed-base flight training devices (FTDs). That said, the first study in this thesis indicated that in NZ, even the cost of certified FTDs is still beyond the reach of most flight training schools and their students. The central tenet of this thesis is that a cost effective strategy for smaller flight training schools could be the utilisation of low-cost personal computer based aviation-training devices (PCATDs) for flight instruction and procedural training tasks. Although a number of studies have indicated that the fidelity of PCATDs may be quite low when compared to FTDs, especially in control loading and flight dynamics, there is some evidence of a positive transfer of training from the PCATD to the aircraft. Significant research has been conducted on the effective use of PCATDs to reduce Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) training time in the aircraft. Conversely, few studies have examined the use of PCATDs for Visual Flight Rules (VFR) training. This lack of research is likely due to the limited fidelity of most PCATDs, especially in the critical area of visual displays. Customised PCATDs were developed to address these fidelity issues by utilising innovative and cost effective software and hardware technologies. The aim of this study was to investigate potential training benefits and cost effectiveness of utilising low cost PCATDs, to improve pilot proficiency in performing VFR procedures. A quasi-transfer study was undertaken to ascertain whether a customised low cost PCATD was as effective as a Civil Aviation Authority certified FTD at improving pilot proficiency in the performance of a standard <b>VFR</b> <b>traffic</b> pattern operation. 1. There was no evidence of a difference in VFR task performance between participants trained on the PCATD and the FTD when tested on the FTD. In addition, there were significant improvements in VFR task performance compared to a control group that received no simulator training. 2. A follow-up study compared VFR task performance of two groups with significantly different levels of aviation experience that were trained and tested on the PCATD. Again, there was no evidence of any significant differences in VFR performance between these two groups of pilot trainees and this demonstrated that the PCATD could impart equal training benefits to both experienced and ab-initio pilots. The Civil Aviation Authority certification of two of the PCATDs developed in this study provided formal recognition of the training potential of these devices. In addition, the study has demonstrated that small to medium sized flight schools could enhance their training programmes significantly by deploying low cost PCATDs...|$|E
