40|$|Abstract. Identification of <b>vulnerable</b> groups <b>in</b> water {{resource}} conflicts {{is to improve}} the identification of <b>vulnerable</b> groups <b>in</b> the allocation of water rights and water markets water rights system. There are two difficulties: one is how to determine the weight of evaluation indexes; another is how to effectively deal with the subjectivity of the evaluation process and the low resolution. Therefore, this paper proposes “Information Entropy Based Fuzzy Pattern Recognition Model for Identification of <b>Vulnerable</b> Groups <b>in</b> Water Resource Conflicts (EFPQ- VRWC) ” according to the fuzzy pattern recognition based on the combination of the maximum entropy principle and genetic algorithms. And identifying vulnerable groups of Daling River Basin in Liaoning Province, it illustrates the method of application value. And evaluation results have continuity, comparability and versatility so that can accurately reflect the level of <b>vulnerable</b> groups <b>in</b> {{water resource}} conflicts...|$|R

5|$|The Battle of Britain proved for {{the first}} time that the Junkers Ju 87 was <b>vulnerable</b> <b>in</b> hostile skies against well-organised and {{determined}} fighter opposition. The Ju 87, like other dive bombers, was slow and possessed inadequate defences. Furthermore, it could not be effectively protected by fighters because of its low speed, and the very low altitudes at which it ended its dive bomb attacks. The Stuka depended on air superiority, the very thing being contested over Britain. It was withdrawn from attacks on Britain in August after prohibitive losses, leaving the Luftwaffe without precision ground-attack aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{expense of}} {{resources}} during the RomanPersian Wars ultimately proved catastrophic for both empires. The prolonged and escalating warfare of the 6th and 7th centuries left them exhausted and <b>vulnerable</b> <b>in</b> {{the face of}} the sudden emergence and expansion of the Caliphate, whose forces invaded both empires only a few {{years after the end of}} the last RomanPersian war. Benefiting from their weakened condition, the Arab Muslim armies swiftly conquered the entire Sasanian Empire, and deprived the Eastern Roman Empire of its territories in the Levant, the Caucasus, Egypt, and the rest of North Africa. Over the following centuries, more of the Eastern Roman Empire came under Muslim rule.|$|E

5|$|The {{techniques}} and technologies to deliver supplies by air {{were in their}} infancy. There were few aircraft available, and these were {{of a variety of}} different types, complicating maintenance. Air operations in New Guinea were restricted by the weather. Transport aircraft were <b>vulnerable</b> <b>in</b> the air, and required fighter escorts. They were also subject to destruction on the ground by Japanese air raids. The loss of the airstrip at Kokoda led to the adoption of air dropping. Due to a shortage of parachutes, supplies often had to be dropped without them, and loss due to breakages and unrecoverable goods was high.|$|E
5|$|Tubenoses have smaller egg {{clutches}} {{and much}} {{longer and more}} variable incubation and fledging times than passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling swifts in these developmental factors. Tubenoses and swifts have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are <b>vulnerable</b> <b>in</b> the nest but food is usually plentiful. In the particular case of the storm petrel, it has a body temperature perhaps 3°C lower than other small birds, and this may {{also contribute to the}} lengthy incubation.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{classified}} as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and not listed nationally as threatened, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is declining in numbers in Victoria and South Australia. This is due to habitat fragmentation and loss of large trees used for breeding hollows, although birds have become more plentiful {{in the vicinity of}} pine plantations. It has been listed as <b>vulnerable</b> <b>in</b> South Australia, due to its decline in the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges, and particularly the perilous status of the small isolated population on the Eyre Peninsula, which has declined sharply since European settlement, probably from loss of suitable habitat. A recovery program was commenced in 1998. Efforts to increase the population include fencing off remnants of native bushland, planting food plants such as Hakea rugosa, monitoring breeding, and raising chicks in captivity. As a result, the population has increased from a low of 19–21 individuals in 1998.|$|E

5|$|Although the French {{troops would}} have a higher {{proportion}} of motorised units than their German adversaries, in view of the respective distances to be covered, they could not hope to reach their assigned sector advancing in battle deployment before the enemy did. Their only prospect of beating the Germans to it lay in employing rail transport. This implied they would be <b>vulnerable</b> <b>in</b> the concentration phase, building up their forces near Breda. They needed the Dutch troops in the Peel-Raam Position to delay the Germans for a few extra days to allow a French deployment and entrenchment, but French rapid forces also would provide a security screen. These consisted of the reconnaissance units of the armoured and motorised divisions, equipped with the relatively well-armed Panhard 178 armoured car. These would be concentrated into two task forces named after their commander: the Groupe Beauchesne and the Groupe Lestoquoi.|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 TGS event, it was {{revealed}} that Hope's silver hair was meant for Lightning, but when her hair color was decided as pink, Hope received the silver hair coloring instead. Hope's Academy uniform for XIII-2 was designed by Hideo Minaba. While he was portrayed as sensitive and <b>vulnerable</b> <b>in</b> XIII, for XIII-2, the game's director wished to portray Hope as a more mature, authoritative person. According to Toriyama, how Hope matured, as seen through Lightning's eyes, formed one of the main story themes for Lightning Returns. He was originally going to have a third unique design for the game, but the team eventually decided to settle on his original teenage appearance. In a later interview, he said that while the character was much liked by the team, he felt that Hope lacked the heroic image that could make him a leading character. Watanabe later said that he felt Hope helped complete Lightning's character and enable her to grow as a person. Hope is voiced by Vincent Martella in English and Yūki Kaji in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{released}} {{the results of}} a five-year-long study (the Highway Serial Killings Initiative) investigating the unsolved murders of prostitutes, hitchhikers, and stranded motorists. Over 500 female victims have been compiled in a database, most of whom were killed or discarded at truck stops, hotels, and roadsides. The FBI has speculated that many of these victims were murdered by long-haul truck drivers, some of whom may be serial killers. Investigators speculate that the easy access to potential victims, mobility, and lack of supervision enjoyed by long-haul truck drivers have contributed to this phenomenon. The head of the initiative, Michael Harrigan, says most of the victims lead high-risk lifestyles (e.g., prostitution) which left them particularly <b>vulnerable.</b> <b>In</b> 2004, the FBI began investigating a string of murders in which the victims were found along the Interstate 40 corridor in Oklahoma and several other states, which sparked the creation of the Highway Serial Killings Initiative.|$|E

5|$|Resident from India and Sri Lanka through Southeast Asia to Australia on coasts {{and major}} waterways, the white-bellied sea eagle breeds and hunts near water, and fish form around {{half of its}} diet. Opportunistic, it consumes carrion and {{a wide variety of}} animals. Although rated of Least Concern globally, it has {{declined}} in parts of southeast Asia such as Thailand, and southeastern Australia. It is ranked as Threatened in Victoria and <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>in</b> South Australia and Tasmania. Human disturbance to its habitat is the main threat, both from direct human activity near nests which impacts on breeding success, and from removal of suitable trees for nesting. The white-bellied sea eagle is revered by indigenous people in many parts of Australia, and is the subject of various folk tales throughout its range.|$|E
5|$|Swifts as {{a family}} have smaller egg {{clutches}} and much longer and more variable incubation and fledging times than passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling tubenoses in these developmental factors. Young birds reach a maximum weight heavier than their parents; they can cope with not being fed {{for long periods of}} time, and delay their feather growth when undernourished. Swifts and seabirds have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are <b>vulnerable</b> <b>in</b> the nest but food is usually plentiful. These adaptations mean that when conditions are good, the survival rate is very high. One large Yellow Sea colony had hatching success of 73.5%, with 63.6% of the chicks fledging. The average productivity was 1.24fledged young per pair per year.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the smalltail shark {{consists}} {{mainly of}} bony fishes such as croakers, while crustaceans, cephalopods, and smaller {{sharks and rays}} may also be consumed. It is viviparous, meaning the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection. Females bear litters of two to nine young on a biennial cycle, following an approximately 12-month gestation period. The smalltail shark is often caught as bycatch and {{may be used for}} meat, fins, liver oil, cartilage, and fishmeal. The impact of fishing on its population is largely unknown except off northern Brazil, where it seems to have declined significantly since the 1980s. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as Data Deficient overall and as <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>in</b> Brazil.|$|E
