25|$|Changes {{were again}} modest: Five smaller front fender vents {{replaced}} the three larger ones, and flat-finish rockers sans ribbing conferred a lower, less chunky appearance. New {{was a single}} backup light, mounted above the license plate. The previous models' wheel covers gave way to slotted six-inch Rally wheels with chrome beauty rings and lug nuts concealed behind chrome caps. Interior alterations were modest and included revised upholstery, and the handbrake moved from beneath the dash to between the seats. The convertible's optional hardtop was offered with a black <b>vinyl</b> <b>cover,</b> which was a fad among all cars at the time.|$|E

500|$|The cover art to [...] "Free Free"/"Super Music Maker" [...] {{was photographed}} by Takashiro Akihisa, who also {{directed}} the accompanying music video for the song, and was revealed on July 18, 2007. There are three different artworks; the normal CD cover featured Suzuki kneeling down, whilst the DVD had her bending {{down with her}} back towards the camera. The artworks {{were placed on the}} back of the jewelcases, and the booklet featured another shot of her looking upwards; when opened, her bottom half is shown on the other side of the book. Additionally, Avex printed the booklets in a special lenticular paper that imitated the LED lights in the background of the photoshoot. This shot was then used as the official <b>vinyl</b> <b>cover,</b> tinted in pink. Taken from the video shoot, an editor for the website Sanspo compared the art to the work of Japanese recording artist Kumi Koda, where he/she described the shoot as [...] "sexy". Another reviewer, reporting from Natalie.mu, commended its [...] "decorative" [...] lights and felt it expressed the songs [...] "technopop" [...] style.|$|E
2500|$|The Concept Grand Touring was {{a larger}} luxury {{hatchback}} designed for four-passengers. The interior was appointed in leather and corduroy upholstery and luxury appointments with deep-pile carpeting. The front end featured a [...] "venturi" [...] grille with rally-type lights. The {{rear side windows}} were [...] "opera" [...] recessed and surrounded by a <b>vinyl</b> <b>cover</b> that ran over the roof's rear quarter. The Concept GT car had genuine wire wheels.|$|E

2500|$|Modern Romance {{subsequently}} released {{their second}} studio album titled Trick of the Light (1983). The album was a success, reaching No. 53 on the UK Album Chart, and one significant change was the re-recording {{of the single}} [...] "Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White" [...] (the new recording of this version was included on both Trick of the Light and Party Tonight) with Mullins lending the song his softer vocals. The album itself has since {{made it into the}} Taschen book, 1000 Record Covers, that showcases the most interesting and original <b>vinyl</b> <b>cover</b> art from the 1960s – 1990s (Mullins and David Jaymes grace the front cover of the album). The third single to be taken from Trick of the Light – [...] "Don't Stop That Crazy Rhythm" [...] (1983) – made the Top 20, eventually rising to No. 14. The final single – an uncharacteristic ballad titled [...] "Walking in the Rain" [...] (1983) – settled again in the Top 10 at No. 7. Mullins toured with Modern Romance extensively, across Europe and the Far East; they picked-up silver and gold discs along the way, released the album Juanita (1983) in Japan, and reached the No. 1 spot in Thailand with [...] "Walking in the Rain" [...] (1983).|$|E
