5|$|The <b>Virgin</b> Islands dwarf sphaero, also {{referred}} to as the <b>Virgin</b> Islands dwarf gecko, was discovered in the summer of 1964 by biologist Richard Thomas during a collecting trip along the dry, wooded slopes of <b>Virgin</b> Gorda in the British <b>Virgin</b> Islands. The holotype for Sphaerodactylus parthenopion, MCZ 77211, was an adult female collected on 12 August 1964 on a hillside above Pond Bay. A total of eight paratypes were collected on <b>Virgin</b> Gorda and used to describe the new species.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{airlines}} {{interested in a}} takeover of <b>Virgin</b> America approached the airline in late 2015, prompting <b>Virgin</b> America to correspond with an undisclosed financial adviser about how and if to proceed with a sale. Alaska Air Group and JetBlue Airways were the two most interested companies to make offers to purchase the airline from <b>Virgin</b> Group. In December 2015, Alaska was interested at $44.75 per share, before JetBlue manifested its interest in February 2016. A bidding war ensued culminating on March 31 and April 1 at $57 per share, % higher than the day's closure at $38.9. On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced that it had agreed to buy <b>Virgin</b> America for $2.6 billion. Including debt and aircraft leases, the transaction was worth approximately $4 billion. Had the merger agreement been terminated by <b>Virgin</b> America, {{they would have been}} contractually obligated to pay Alaska Air Group a termination fee equal to $78.5 million.|$|E
5|$|Alaska Air Group {{acquired}} <b>Virgin</b> America in 2016, at a {{valuation of}} $2.6 billion, with additional expenses bringing {{the cost to}} approximately $4 billion.

5|$|In 2012, British Airways {{took over}} British Midland International (BMI) which {{gave them a}} {{monopoly}} on UK mainland flights from Heathrow.

Little Red was later revealed to be operated on a wet-lease by Aer Lingus whereby the planes would be operated by Aer Lingus but would bear <b>Virgin</b> Atlantic livery.

5|$|In March 2010, <b>Virgin</b> America {{announced}} {{its intention to}} start flying to Toronto from Los Angeles and San Francisco, making it the airline's first international destination. Following the Department of Transportation's approval of <b>Virgin</b> America's proposal to fly to Canada, international service began on June 29, 2010. However, due to high operating costs and higher demand for Dallas/Fort-Worth, <b>Virgin</b> America terminated Toronto service on April 6, 2011. <b>Virgin</b> America began its service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in December 2010, and continued until after {{the repeal of the}} Wright Amendment in October 2014, which prompted the airline to establish a focus city at the Dallas Love Field and enhance the number of connecting destinations.

5|$|Matthew and Luke each {{describe}} Jesus' nativity (or birth), {{especially that}} Jesus was born by a <b>virgin</b> Mary in Bethlehem in fulfillment of prophecy.

5|$|The <b>Virgin</b> Islands dwarf sphaero or <b>Virgin</b> Islands dwarf gecko (Sphaerodactylus parthenopion) is {{a species}} of gecko and {{also one of the}} {{smallest}} terrestrial vertebrates. It has only been found on three of the British <b>Virgin</b> Islands: <b>Virgin</b> Gorda, Tortola, and Moskito Island (also spelled “Mosquito Island”). It was discovered in 1964 and is suspected to be a close relative of Sphaerodactylus nicholsi, a dwarf sphaero from the nearby island of Puerto Rico. It shares its range with the big-scaled least gecko (S.macrolepis), which is found in leaf litter. Unlike this larger gecko, the <b>Virgin</b> Islands dwarf sphaero lives on drier hillsides, yet prefers moist microhabitats found under rocks because it lacks the adaptations necessary for preventing water loss, which is a significant problem due to its small body size.|$|E

50|$|The {{sculptures of}} the five wise and the five foolish <b>virgins</b> (see The ten <b>virgins</b> from the List of Bible stories), also around 1250.

The five wise <b>virgins</b> are prepared and bring oil to a wedding, whereas the five foolish <b>virgins</b> are unprepared and bring no oil. Hence they have to go find oil and subsequently arrive late and cannot join the wedding anymore. The unknown artist masterfully expresses the emotions in the faces and the body languages of the girls, showing a much more realistic expression than what was common in art around that time. All figures are different, and have ethnic Slavic features. The sculptures are outside of the north entrance to the transept.|$|R
