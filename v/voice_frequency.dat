50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} dial-up modems, which modulate bits into {{signals in}} the 300-3400 Hz baseband (voice service), DSL modems modulate frequencies from 4000 Hz to {{as high as}} 4 MHz. This frequency band separation enables DSL service and {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS) to coexist on the same copper pair facility. On the subscriber's end of the circuit, inline low-pass DSL filters (splitters) are installed on each telephone to filter the high-frequency signals that would otherwise be heard as hiss, but pass <b>voice</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Conversely, high-pass filters already incorporated in the circuitry of DSL modems filter out <b>voice</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Although ADSL and RADSL modulations do not use the voice-frequency band, nonlinear elements in the phone could otherwise generate audible intermodulation and may impair the operation of the data modem in the absence of high-pass filters.|$|R

50|$|In telephony, the usable <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> band {{ranges from}} {{approximately}} 300 Hz to 3400 Hz. It {{is for this}} reason that the ultra low frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum between 300 and 3000 Hz is also referred to as <b>voice</b> <b>frequency,</b> being the electromagnetic energy that represents acoustic energy at baseband. The bandwidth allocated for a single voice-frequency transmission channel is usually 4 kHz, including guard bands, allowing a sampling rate of 8 kHz to be used as the basis of the pulse code modulation system used for the digital PSTN. Per the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, the sampling frequency (8 kHz) must be at least twice the highest component of the <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> via appropriate filtering prior to sampling at discrete times (4 kHz) for effective reconstruction of the voice signal.|$|E

50|$|The wartime {{upgrading}} {{of telecommunications}} from Townsville to Thursday Island was a dedicated defence facility, but was linked {{directly to the}} 1880s overland telegraph. An R Type Carrier System, developed in Australia during World War II to cater for pockets of telecommunications traffic congestion, particularly in places where a telephone carrier was not available to supply a channel for a <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> system, was installed along the old overland telegraph route from Mount Surprise to Cape York. The R Type system was limited to four duo-directional channels using a frequency between 3300 and 5220 cycles per second, which was above normal <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> but below the range of other established carrier systems, which used high frequency bands. There was no interference when both normal speech frequency and the carrier frequency operated over the same pair of copper wires. In effect, one pair of copper wires from Townsville to Thursday Island was to carry 3 facilities: normal <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> telephone, upgraded telegraph carrier, and a telephone carrier.|$|E

40|$|This is a publisher’s {{version of}} an article {{published}} in the Journal of the Otolaryngological Society of Australia 1983. This version is reproduced with permission from the Otolaryngological Society of Australia. The results of a multiple-electrode cochlear implant carried out on 1 st August, 1978 on a totally deaf patient (post-lingual hearing loss) showed that he could perceive sounds of different pitches depending on the electrode stimulated, and this finding was consistent with the place theory of frequency coding. Furthermore, stimulating individual electrodes produced percepts which the patient described as vowel-like in quality. The patient could also perceive different pitches which varied with the rate of stimulation up to 200 pulses/second, but at higher rates he had difficulties perceiving pitch changes (Clark et al. 1978; Tong et al, 1979). As a result of the psychophysical studies a speech processor was developed. The speech processor extracted: firstly, the <b>voicing</b> <b>frequency</b> to help the patient hear the rhythm of speech and know whether a speech sound was voiced or unvoiced (e. g., /b/ versus /p/); and, secondly, the second formant to enable the patient to recognize vowels and consonants and so hear words. In order to maximize speech intelligibility, the second formant stimulated an appropriate electrode, and the rate of stimulation on that electrode was related to the <b>voicing</b> <b>frequency.</b> Open Acces...|$|R
