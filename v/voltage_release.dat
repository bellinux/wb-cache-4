The group's first two albums, High Voltage and the harder driving T.N.T., had been hits {{in their native}} Australia the single [...] "It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)" [...] peaked at #5 and now plans were made for the band to tour England in 1976. The group had already recorded their next single [...] "Jailbreak" [...] (for which they had shot a music video) and had already begun recording their third LP Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap when, in April 1976, they flew out on their first British tour. The international release only included two tracks from the Australian High <b>Voltage</b> <b>release</b> [...] "She's Got Balls" [...] and [...] "Little Lover" [...] {{with the rest of}} the songs taken from the T.N.T.. The band arrived in the UK in the midst of the fledgling punk movement, spearheaded by bands like the Sex Pistols and the Damned. AC/DC was never really part of the movement, but got misidentified as such by some observers, as guitarist Angus Young recalled to Guitar Worlds Alan Di Perna in 1993: ...|$|E
40|$|An {{electromagnetic}} relay test {{system is designed}} based on the 32 -bit floating-point Microcontrollers (MCU) : TMS 320 F 28335. In the test system, the relay characteristic parameters, such as the coil resistance, pull-in <b>voltage,</b> <b>release</b> voltage and time parameters, can be tested by sampling of the relay coil current, electric shock voltage and drive supply voltage. The tested results can be displayed on the LCD and transmitted to PC. The sampling frequency {{of the system is}} 10 M Hertz, which is higher than the other relay test system. The whole system is portable and has low power consumption. Finally, the experimental results verify that the required parameters of the relay can be tested accurately using the designed system...|$|E
40|$|Summary of Research {{that was}} part of the grant: NASA NAG 5 - 13405 : Magnetic Characterization of Micro Shutters for James Web Space Telescope (JWST) Period: May 1 2003 -October 31 2005 The above funding {{resulted}} in following major achievements related to microshutter system for JWST. 1. The original rectangular pattern of magnetic material was changed into magnetic striped pattern to prevent unnecessary twisting during the actuation. The Original geometry favored magnetic remanence vector being oriented along the longer side of the shutter and thus resulting torque caused out of plane twist. Stripe pattern minimizes the out of plane motion and thus prolongs the life-time of microshutter device. 2. We built a new magnetic system (magnetic rotisserie) allowing an accelerated life test of microshutters at various temperatures. This system identified that shutter are capable to withstand as many as several millions of actuating cycles. Our system also identified fabrication related features, like bowing with temperature, collisions with the frame due to misalignment, delaminating of the light shields due to uncontrolled <b>voltage</b> <b>release</b> and poorly fabricated light shields...|$|E

25|$|A {{photomultiplier}} is a phototube whose sensitivity {{is greatly}} increased {{through the use}} of electron multiplication. This works on the principle of secondary emission, whereby a single electron emitted by the photocathode strikes a special sort of anode known as a dynode causing more electrons to be released from that dynode. Those electrons are accelerated toward another dynode at a higher <b>voltage,</b> <b>releasing</b> more secondary electrons; as many as 15 such stages provide a huge amplification. Despite great advances in solid-state photodetectors, the single-photon detection capability of photomultiplier tubes makes this vacuum tube device excel in certain applications. Such a tube can also be used for detection of ionizing radiation {{as an alternative to the}} Geiger–Müller tube (itself not an actual vacuum tube). Historically, the image orthicon TV camera tube widely used in television studios prior to the development of modern CCD arrays also used multistage electron multiplication.|$|R
