His unit was tasked to {{approach}} the enemy by surprise and quickly return to camp. Luna had admired García's unit <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> he wanted to increase their size. However, García declined the offer. He believed that a larger force might undermine the efficiency of their work.

25|$|For {{thousands}} of years, male homosexuality {{was referred to}} in literature by alluding to two semi-legendary figures from the early Zhou Dynasty. The first was Mizi Xia and the half-eaten peach which he shared with his lover, the actual historical figure, Duke Ling of Wei. The second was Lord Long Yang, who convinced an unnamed King of Wei to remain faithful to him by comparing himself to a small fish which the King might throw back if a larger fish came along. While both Mizi Xia and Lord Long Yang may have actually existed, nothing is known about them beyond their defining stories, and their presence in Chinese literature was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> of legendary characters who served as archetypes of homosexual love.|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} {{appearance}} in over three months on 3 May 2009, Barton was sent off late in a 3–0 loss to Liverpool at Anfield for a sliding challenge on Xabi Alonso. The red card ruled Barton out of Newcastle's remaining three matches of the season, with the club in danger of relegation from the Premier League. Newcastle manager Alan Shearer raised doubts about Barton's future at the club, saying [...] "I {{think it would be}} wrong to discuss his future now, but I'm not very happy." [...] On 5 May, Newcastle United announced the suspension of Barton indefinitely, and Barton was told to stay away from the club. As a result, Barton's future at Newcastle United was put in doubt. The club suspension was widely reportedly to have resulted not directly from the red card, but from a dressing room confrontation with Shearer and assistant manager Iain Dowie following the match. Shearer said he made a mistake putting Barton back into the team, and that his tackle was [...] "a coward's tackle", to which Barton replied that he was [...] "the best player at the club", and Shearer had to play him. Shearer said that Barton was not, and that he was [...] "shit". Barton replied that Shearer was [...] "a shit manager with shit tactics". When Dowie intervened, Barton called him [...] "a prick". Barton was reportedly transfer listed, with former manager Sam Allardyce reported to have been interested in taking Barton to Blackburn Rovers. Barton's counsellor has said that Barton [...] "would love to work with Alan Shearer again" [...] and [...] "feels <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> he owes the club and the fans." ...|$|E
500|$|The Moving Picture World gave it minor {{praise and}} short {{summary of the}} film, {{but it does not}} {{evaluate}} or describe the special camera effects used to produce the film. The reviewer states: [...] "To see the doll and the pumpkin suddenly assume life is interesting and naturally causes the little girl to whom they belong surprise. The good times they have with the fairy's help will long remain in her memory, even though it is only a dream." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was critical of the production, stating [...] "This sounds as if it ought to be very clever, but aside from the work of the little heroine and the dance of the fairies it is entirely uninspired. It needs a drastic application of imagination. The broad idea is excellent, but the details of the management indicate impoverished resources. When the aid of fairies is invoked it opens up all sorts of avenues of fanciful treatment, but this film doesn't get away from stolid realities. For example, nobody could imagine anything more earthly than the outside of the house from which the little girl escaped with the fairy queen and her comrades. That should have been treated fancifully. The events pictured don't amount to anything; there is a sameness about them, nothing surprising happens, and not <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> is pretty. Worst of all is the poetry(?), which is interpolated to explain the narrative; that is beyond criticism. The Thanhouser Company has missed good opportunities in this film." [...] The strange inclusion of the question mark after poetry is not a note by Bowers, for it was actually written into the review itself in the edition. Though no other review mentions poetry.|$|E

2500|$|After Bill McCay {{had written}} a series of five novels {{continuing}} the story the original creators had envisioned, and despite {{the success of the}} Stargate television series, Dean Devlin stated in 2006 that [...] "he has struck a production deal with MGM and is developing the long-delayed sequel feature films that will pick up the story from the 1994 original" [...] According to Devlin, two movie sequels would have picked up the story from the 1994 original, but not the mythology of the SG-1 and Atlantis series, with the original stars Kurt Russell and James Spader. Devlin regretted giving MGM control over the franchise. The first movie already tapped into Egyptian mythology; the second one would have moved into other mythologies; and the third would tie all the mythologies together.

2500|$|In Taihoku, {{at around}} 2:30 PM as the bomber with Bose on board {{was leaving the}} {{standard}} path taken by aircraft during take-off, the passengers inside heard a loud sound, similar to an engine backfiring. [...] The mechanics on the tarmac saw something {{fall out of the}} plane. [...] It was the portside engine, or a part of it, and the propeller. [...] The plane swung wildly to the right and plummeted, crashing, breaking into two, and exploding into flames. Inside, the chief pilot, copilot and Lieutenant-General Tsunamasa Shidei, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, who was to have made the negotiations for Bose with the Soviet army in Manchuria, were instantly killed. [...] Bose's assistant Habibur Rahman was stunned, passing out briefly, and Bose, although conscious and not fatally hurt, was soaked in gasoline. [...] When Rahman came to, he and Bose attempted to leave by the rear door, but found it blocked by the luggage. [...] They then decided to run through the flames and exit from the front. [...] The ground staff, now approaching the plane, saw two people staggering towards them, one of whom had become a human torch. [...] The human torch turned out to be Bose, whose gasoline-soaked clothes had instantly ignited. Rahman and a few others managed to smother the flames, but also noticed that Bose's face and head appeared badly burned. [...] According to Joyce Chapman Lebra, [...] "A truck which served as ambulance rushed Bose and the other passengers to the Nanmon Military Hospital south of Taihoku." [...] The airport personnel called Dr. Taneyoshi Yoshimi, the surgeon-in-charge at the hospital at around 3 PM. Bose was conscious and mostly coherent when they reached the hospital, and for some time thereafter. [...] Bose was naked, except for a blanket wrapped around him, and Dr. Yoshimi immediately saw evidence of third-degree burns on many parts of the body, especially on his chest, doubting <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> he would live.
