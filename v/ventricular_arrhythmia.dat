40|$|Background. The {{impact of}} {{thrombolytic}} therapy on {{the incidence of}} complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> is not yet clarified. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the impact of thrombolytic therapy on the incidence of complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias,</b> as well as long term association between complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> and left <b>ventricular</b> remodelling, and their impact on five-year lethality. Methods. Ninety seven consecutive patients with first acute myocardial infarction (streptokinase was administered in 58 patients) underwent 24 -hours Holter monitoring at discharge. <b>Ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> were classified according to Lown classification, and patients were grouped into the group with simple <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> (Lown class 0 to 2), and the group with complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> (Lown class 3 to 5). Echocardiography was performed at discharge, and six and twelve months after the infarction. Left ventricular volume indexes and ejection fraction was determined using Simpson's biplane formula. Results. In patients with complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> left <b>ventricular</b> volume indexes were higher and ejection fraction was lower throughout the study, whereas wall motion score index was higher one year after the infarction. On the other hand, these variables were similar throughout the follow-up within the groups of patients with and without complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> who received thrombolytic therapy. The incidence of complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> was similar in thrombolysed and non-thrombolysed patients (11 / 58 vs. 5 / 39). There was no difference in five year lethality between patients with and without complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> (4 / 16 vs. 13 / 81 patients). Conclusion. Our data indicated that left ventricular remodelling in patients with complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> was not progressive after hospital discharge. The presence of complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> was not associated with the increased five-year lethality, despite of more pronounced left ventricular remodelling. It occured that thrombolysis per se had no influence on the incidence of complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> in the late hospital phase after the first acute myocardial infarction...|$|R
40|$|The incidence, {{risk factors}} and {{long-term}} prognosis of complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> after {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery are not known. Complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> are defined as Lown grades 4 a (couplets), 4 b (ventricular tachycardia) and 5 (R on T phenomenon). Ninety-two patients with normal left ventricular function who underwent elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery were prospectively evaluated. <b>Ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> were documented by predischarge 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring; 43 % of patients had no or simple <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> (Lown grades 1 to 3) and 57 % had complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> Risk factors analyzed included age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, preoperative digoxin or propranolol therapy, cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic crossclamp time, number of vessels bypassed, peak creatine kinase (CK) elevation and pericarditis. No risk factor identified patients at higher risk for complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> Patients were followed up for 6 to 24 months (mean 16). Patients with complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> did not have a higher incidence of sudden death, cardiac death, syncope, angina, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident. It was concluded that: 1) Complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> are common after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 2) None of the risk factors considered identify high risk patients. 3) Complex <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> after coronary artery bypass graft surgery do not indicate a poor prognosis in patients with normal left ventricular function...|$|R

25|$|Nadolol {{is one of}} the {{preferred}} beta-blockers in the management of patients with LQTS for shortening of the QT interval and prevention of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia.</b> It is more efficacious than metoprolol in the prevention of breakthrough cardiac events while on therapy and is equivalent to propranolol. Nadolol has the advantage of once daily dosing and thus improved patient compliance. For patients with decreased kidney function, nadolol may be dosed less often. It has also been found to be useful (off-label) for several neurological disorders such as the prevention of migraine attacks, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD) and its use has been explored as a treatment for essential tremor and Parkinson's disease but neither is well established.|$|E
25|$|While {{a healthy}} diet is beneficial, the effect of {{antioxidant}} supplementation (vitamin E, vitamin C, etc.) or vitamins has not been shown to protect against cardiovascular disease {{and in some cases}} may possibly result in harm.

The study was performed using physiological stress, such as the Valsalva manoeuvre, isometric exercise and treadmill exercise, to initiate <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> before and after intravenous propranolol or labetalol and to document arrhythmias during 24 hour electrocardiography before and after oral medication.

Kcne3 deletion in mice also predisposes to ventricular arrhythmogenesis, but KCNE3 expression is not detectable in mouse heart. The mechanism for ventricular arrhythmogenesis was demonstrated to be indirect, and associated with autoimmune attack of the adrenal gland and secondary hyperaldosteronism (KCNE3 is not detectable in the adrenal gland).

Aims: This {{study was designed}} to examine factors influencing {{development of}} <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> in adult patients undergoing cardiovascular operations during the catheter placement. Settings and Designs: Prospective, observational, cohort study. Methods: We prospectively studied 174 patients undergoing cardiovascular operations. A PAC was inserted through the right internal jugular vein by staff anesthesiologists. Electrocardiography tracings were recorded as the catheter was advanced from the right atrium to the pulmonary artery. Arrhythmias were classified as absent, single, or multiple (two or more consecutive) <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> We examined risk factors to produce <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> during the placement. Statistical Analysis: The data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis to assess factors for the occurrence of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> after univariate analyses. Results: <b>Ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> (single and multiple) occurred in 149 patients (85. 6 %) and multiple arrhythmias were observed in 78 patients (44. 8 %). There were no factors to facilitate the <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> (single and multiple), whereas it showed that valvular diseases (P = 0. 049) and the placement time (P < 0. 001) are significant factors to produce multiple arrhythmias.

MethodsThe Multidisciplinary Study of Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy established the North American ARVC Registry and enrolled patients with a diagnosis of ARVC. Patients were followed prospectively. ResultsOf 137 patients enrolled, 108 received ICDs. Forty-eight patients had 502 sustained episodes of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias,</b> including 489 that were monomorphic and 13 that were polymorphic. In the patients with ICDs, independent predictors of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> in follow-up included spontaneous sustained <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> before ICD implantation and T-wave inversions inferiorly. The only independent predictor for life-threatening arrhythmias, defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT)  ≥ 240 beats/min or ventricular fibrillation, was a younger age at enrollment. Anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP), independent of the cycle length of the VT, was successful in terminating 92 % of VT episodes.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{circadian}} variation of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> detected by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator in patients with and without ischemic heart disease. BACKGROUNDPrevious studies have shown a circadian variation of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias,</b> sudden death and myocardial infarction with a peak occurrence in the morning hours. The circadian pattern, which is similar for both arrhythmic and ischemic events, suggests that ischemia may play a critical role in the genesis of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> and sudden death. We hypothesized that, if ischemia plays an important role in the triggering of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias,</b> the circadian pattern should be different in patients with ischemic heart disease compared with patients with nonischemic heart disease. METHODSThe circadian variation of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> recorded by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator was studied in 310 patients during a mean follow-up of 181 ± 163 days. Two hundred four patients had a history of ischemic heart disease and 106 patients had nonischemic heart disease. The times of the episodes of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> were retrieved from the data log of each device during follow-up, and the circadian pattern was compared between the two groups. RESULTSDuring follow-up, 1, 061 episodes of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> were recorded by the device in the 310 patients. Six hundred eighty-two episodes occurred in the group of patients with ischemic heart disease and 379 occurred in the nonischemic heart disease group. The circadian variation of the episodes showed a typical pattern with a morning and afternoon peak in both groups of patients with ischemic and nonischemic heart disease, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONSThe circadian rhythm of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> in patients with ischemic heart disease is similar to patients with nonischemic heart disease, suggesting that the trigger mechanisms of the initiation of ventricular tachyarrhythmias may be similar, irrespective of the underlying heart disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} therapy with {{atenolol}} and tocainide, separately or in combination, was studied in 20 patients with hypertension and concomitant <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> Patients were given 400 mg tocainide, three times daily, 100 mg atenolol, once daily (plus 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 2. 5 mg amiloride diuretics if required) and {{a combination of}} these treatments. Tocainide alone significantly reduced the incidence of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> without affecting atrial arrhythmias. It also controlled exercise-induced arrhythmias in 7 / 13 (54 %) patients.

40|$|SummaryVasospastic angina is a {{frequent}} and well-recognized pathology with {{a high risk of}} life-threatening <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> and sudden cardiac death. The diagnosis of vasospastic angina requires the combination of clinical and electrocardiographic variables and the results of provocation tests, such as ergonovine administration. Smoking cessation {{is the first step in}} the management of vasospastic angina. Optimal medical treatment using calcium-channel blockers and/or nitrate derivatives can provide protection, but life-threatening <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> may occur despite optimal medical treatment and several years after the start of treatment. In this review, we evaluate the role of implantable defibrillators as a complement to optimal medical management in patients with life-threatening <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> due to vasospastic angina; this role is not well characterized in the literature or guidelines. We discuss the role of implantable defibrillators in secondary prevention in light of three recent cases managed in our departments and a review of the literature. An implantable defibrillator was implanted in two of the three cases of vasospastic angina with <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> that we managed. We considered secondary prevention by implantable defibrillator to be justified even in the absence of any obvious risk factor. <b>Ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> recurred during implantable defibrillator follow-up in the two patients implanted. ConclusionIn patients with life-threatening <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> due to vasospastic angina, an implantable defibrillator should be considered because of the risk of recurrence despite optimal medical management...|$|R
