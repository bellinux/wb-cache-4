40|$|Production {{of virus}} {{occlusion}} bodies that occlude virions comprising genomes of {{different species of}} baculoviruses {{that can be used}} to combat insect pests. A method is presented for the production of occlusion derived virions (ODVs) that simultaneously comprise genomes of different baculovirus species, occluded in a <b>viral</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>body</b> (OB) with the structural and morphological features characteristic of baculoviruses. Mixed genome ODVs and OBs can be produced by co-infecting insect cells or insect hosts using two or more different baculoviruses species. Co-infection may be achieved by simultaneous inoculation of the different baculoviruses or with a time interval between inoculations, which results in different proportions of each species' genomes in the ODVs and OBs that are produced. The produced OBs can be used either directly for preparing an insecticide, or to infect susceptible insects to produce larger quantities of mixed genome ODVs and OBs, also useful for combating pest insects.

This part of the viral genome {{contains}} the gene encoding the <b>viral</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>body</b> protein, polyhedrin. The polyhedrin gene has been sequenced in its entirety together with some of its 5 ' and 3 ' flanking sequences.

Comparison of the primary structures of the polyhedrin of the nuclear polyhedrosis virus of B. mori with that of Autographa californica suggests that considerable selective pressure has been exercised at the protein level during evolution. Nucleotide sequence comparisons of the two structural genes reveal that the coding sequences have diverged significantly through the accumulation of silent and replacement substitutions.

The present study aimed {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of the most prevalent isolate of the Chrysodeixis chalcites nucleopolyhedrovirus (ChchNPV, Baculoviridae) as a biological insecticide. Overall the prevalence of ChchNPV infection in C. chalcites populations was 2. 3 % (103 infected larvae out of 4, 438 sampled), but varied from 0 - 4. 8 % on Tenerife and was usually low (0 - 2 %) on the other islands. On Tenerife, infected larvae were present at 11 out of 17 plantations sampled. The prevalence of infection in larvae on bananas grown under greenhouse structures was significantly higher (3 %) than in open-field sites (1. 4 %). The ChchNPV-TF 1 isolate was the most abundant and widespread of four genetic variants of the virus. Application of 1. 0 x 109 <b>viral</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> (OBs) /l of ChchNPV-TF 1 significantly reduced C. chalcites foliar damage in young banana plants as did commonly used pesticides, both in greenhouse and open-field sites.

However, larvae collected at different time intervals following virus treatments and reared in the laboratory experienced 2 - 7 fold more mortality than insects from conventional insecticide treatments. This suggests that the acquisition of lethal dose occurred over an extended period (up to 7 days) compared to a brief peak in larvae on plants treated with conventional insecticides.

40|$|The Guatemala potato tuber moth Tecia solanivora (Povolny) (Lep. Gelechiidae) is an {{invasive}} species from Mesoamerica that has considerably extended its distribution area in recent decades. While this species {{is considered to}} be a major potato pest in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador, currently no specific control methods are available for farmers. To address this issue we developed a biopesticide formulation to be used in integrated pest management of T. solanivora, following three steps. First, search for entomopathogenic viruses were carried out through extensive bioprospections in 12 countries worldwide. As a result, new Phthorimaea operculella granulovirus (PhopGV) isolates were found in T. solanivora and five other gelechid species. Second, twenty PhopGV isolates, including both previously known and newly found isolates, were genetically and/or biologically characterized in order to choose the best candidate for a biopesticide formulation. Sequence data were obtained for the ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt) gene, a single copy gene known to play a role in pathogenicity. Three different sizes (1086, 1305 and 1353 bp) of egt were found among the virus isolates analyzed. Unexpectedly, no obvious correlation between egt size and pathogenicity was found. Bioassays on T. solanivora neonates showed a maximum of a 14 -fold difference in pathogenicity among the eight PhopGV isolates tested. The most pathogenic PhopGV isolate, JLZ 9 f, had a medium lethal concentration (LC 50) of 10 <b>viral</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> per square mm of consumed tuber skin. Third, we tested biopesticide dust formulations by mixing a dry carrier (calcium carbonate) with different adjuvants (magnesium chloride or an optical brightener or soya lecithin) and different specific amounts of JLZ 9 f.

40|$|Shortly {{prior to}} death, {{many species of}} Lepidoptera {{infected}} with nucleopolyhedrovirus climb upwards on the host plant. This results in improved dissemination of <b>viral</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> over plant foliage and an increased probability of transmission to healthy conspecific larvae. Following applications of Spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus for control of Spodoptera exigua on greenhouse-grown sweet pepper crops, necrophagy was observed by healthy S. exigua larvae that fed on virus-killed conspecifics. We examined whether this risky behavior was induced by olfactory or phagostimulant compounds associated with infected cadavers. Laboratory choice tests and olfactometer studies, involving infected and non-infected cadavers placed on spinach leaf discs, revealed no evidence for greater attraction of healthy larvae to virus-killed over non-infected cadavers. Physical contact or feeding on infected cadavers resulted in a very high incidence of transmission (82 - 93 % lethal disease). Observations {{on the behavior of}} S. exigua larvae on pepper plants revealed that infected insects died on the uppermost 10 % of foliage and closer to the plant stem than healthy conspecifics of the same stage, which we considered clear evidence of baculovirus-induced climbing behavior. Healthy larvae that subsequently foraged on the plant were more frequently observed closer to the infected than the non-infected cadaver. Healthy larvae also encountered and fed on infected cadavers significantly more frequently and more rapidly than larvae that fed on non-infected cadavers. Intraspecific necrophagy on infected cadavers invariably resulted in virus transmission and death of the necrophagous insect. We conclude that, in addition to improving the dissemination of virus particles over plant foliage, baculovirus-induced climbing behavior increases the incidence of intraspecific necrophagy in S. exigua, which is the most efficient mechanism of transmission of this lethal pathogen.

40|$|A 37 -kDa {{polypeptide}} {{specified by}} Autographa californica {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} was found to share significant homology with Choristoneura biennis entomopoxyvirus spheroidin protein, which is the major component of entomopoxvirus <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> Antibodies raised against spheroidin cross-reacted with the 37 -kDa protein and confirmed its expression in the late phase of wild-type baculovirus infection. Immunoblot analysis and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the protein was associated with purified A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> and was absent in purified virions. Immunofluorescence studies localized the protein to the periphery of <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> and the internal membranes of cells infected with wild-type baculovirus. The open reading frame encoding this spheroidinlike protein was inserted into a baculovirus expression vector, and recombinant protein was synthesized under control of the polyhedrin promoter. Studies of the recombinant protein demonstrated that it was heterogeneous in molecular mass {{as a result of}} N-linked glycosylation. Tunicamycin inhibited carbohydrate addition and yielded proteins of 34 and 33 kDa...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Autographa californica {{multiple}} nucleopolyhedrovirus ac 92 is a conserved baculovirus gene with homology to flavin adenine dinucleotide-linked sulfhydryl oxidases. Its product, Ac 92, is {{a functional}} sulfhydryl oxidase. Deletion of ac 92 results in almost negligible levels of budded virus (BV) production, defects in occlusion-derived virus (ODV) co-envelopment and their inefficient incorporation into <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> To determine {{the role of}} sulfhydryl oxidation {{in the production of}} BV, envelopment of nucleocapsids, and nucleocapsid incorporation into <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies,</b> the Trichoplusia ni single nucleopolyhedrovirus ortholog, tn 79, was substituted for ac 92. Tn 79 was found to be an active sulfhydryl oxidase that substituted for Ac 92, resulting in the production of infectious BV, albeit about 10 -fold less than an ac 92 -containing virus. Tn 79 rescued defects in ODV morphogenesis caused by a lack of ac 92. Active Tn 79 sulfhydryl oxidase activity is required for efficient BV production, ODV envelopment, and their subsequent incorporation into <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> in the absence of ac 92...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{role of the}} microtubule-associated P 10 protein of baculoviruses is not yet understood. P 10 has {{previously}} been linked {{with the formation of}} a number of cytoskeletal-like or cytoskeleton-associated structures in the nucleus and cytoplasm, thought {{to be involved in the}} morphogenesis of virus polyhedral <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> The formation of these structures was studied by immunofluorescence laser scanning confocal microscopy in TN 368 cells, a model system amenable to the study of virus interaction with the host cell cytoskeleton. We show that the Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus P 10 protein forms two distinct cytoskeletal-like structures, microtubule-associated filaments and perinuclear tubular aggregates. P 10 also associates with polyhedral <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> Depolymerisation of the microtubule network with colchicine prevents formation of P 10 filaments but not of P 10 tubules. Colchicine treatment enhances the association of P 10 with <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> Transient expression of P 10 showed that both filaments and tubules can form in the absence of other viral proteins. We postulate a number of possible roles of the P 10 protein during virus infection and morphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Scientific advancements {{built on}} an {{understanding}} of what nature already provides are leading to environmentally friendly crop-pest control by either biological agents or specifically designed synthetic antiinsect compounds. A case in point: research on baculoviruses. Baculoviruses are rod-shaped DNA viruses, many of which begin their life cycle reproducing inside cells. In the nuclei of caterpillar cells infected with baculoviruses, viral progeny multiply and are incorporated into protective polyhedronshaped protein structures called <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> Infected caterpillars die and contaminate the leaf surfaces with the <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> Then, healthy caterpillars ingest the <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> and release the virus when feeding on contaminated leaves, thus continuing the life cycle of infection and replication. “Each year, natural baculovirus epidemics nearly wipe out populations of some caterpillar pests, such as corn earworm, cotton bollworm, tobacco budworm, and cabbage’s nemesis—the diamondback moth,” says ARS microbiologist Arthur H. McIntosh, at the Biological Control of Insects Research Laboratory (BCIRL), Columbia, Missouri. If that assertion doesn’t have a familiar ring to most growers of major U. S. crops, it’s probably because the epidemics occur after crop damage has already been done...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method to}} introduce site-specific mutations into the genome of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus. Specifically, the A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus gene for polyhedrin, the major protein that forms <b>viral</b> <b>occlusions</b> in infected cells, was mutagenized by introducing deletions into the cloned DNA fragment containing the gene. The mutagenized polyhedrin gene {{was transferred to the}} intact viral DNA by mixing fragment and viral DNAs, cotransfecting Spodoptera frugiperda cells, and screening for viral recombinants that had undergone allelic exchange. Recombinant viruses with mutant polyhedrin genes were obtained by selecting the progeny virus that did not produce <b>viral</b> <b>occlusions</b> in infected cells (occlusion-negative mutants). Analyses of occlusion-negative mutants demonstrated that the polyhedrin gene was not essential for the production of infectious virus and that deletion of certain sequences within the gene did not alter the control, or decrease the level of expression, of polyhedrin. An early viral protein of 25, 000 molecular weight was apparently not essential for virus replication in vitro, as the synthesis of this protein was not detected in cells infected with a mutant virus...|$|R
50|$|Replication {{follows the}} DNA strand {{displacement}} model. DNA-templated transcription is {{the method of}} transcription. The virus exits the host cell by existing in <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> after cell death and remaining infectious until finding another host.Swine serve as the natural host.|$|R
40|$|A {{strategic}} {{model of}} Nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) genetics is developed {{and applied to}} co-occlusion and {{the dynamics of the}} few polyhedra (FP) phenotype. Co-occlusion is the incorporation of wild-type and mutant viruses in the same <b>occlusion</b> <b>body</b> as a strategy to deliver genetically modified viruses as an insecticide in a way that minimizes their persistence in the environment. The model predicts that the persistence of the modified virus depends most critically on the number of viruses that infect an occlusion body-producing nucleus, the number of <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> typically ingested by an insect, and the number of viruses that cross the gut wall. FP viruses occur at high frequency in cell culture where they have a replication advantage over wild-type virus. They cannot, however, produce viable <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies,</b> but it is shown that under certain circumstances they can persist in natural populations as parasites of wild-type viruses. FP viruses have not as yet been identified in natural NPV populations, and possible reasons for this are discussed. We suggest that the models developed here can also help in studying potential recombination between engineered and wild-type viruses in the environment...|$|R
40|$|Immunological {{comparisons}} {{were made of}} baculovirus structural proteins by using a modification of the radioimmunological techniques described by Renart et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76 : 3116 - 3120, 1979) and Towbin et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76 : 4350 - 4354, 1979). Viral proteins were electrophoresed in polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with viral antisera, and the antibodies were detected with 125 I-labeled Staphylococcus aureus protein A. Antisera were prepared to purified and intact virions from five baculoviruses: Autographa californica, Porthetria dispar, Trichoplusia ni, and Heliothis zea nuclear polyhedrosis viruses (NPVs) and T. ni granulosis virus (GV). These antisera were tested against the virion structural polypeptides of 17 different species of baculoviruses. Specific multiple-nucleocapsid NPV (MNPV), single-nucleocapsid NPV (SNPV), and GV virion polypeptides were shown to have similar antigenic determinants and thus be immunologically related. The molecular weights of the virion polypeptides with cross-reacting antigenic determinants were identified. Antisera prepared to purified A. californica and H. zea MNPV polyhedrin (the <b>occlusion</b> <b>body</b> protein from NPVs) recognized antigenic determinants on all the polyhedrins and granulins (<b>occlusion</b> <b>body</b> protein from GVs) that were tested. No immunological relationship was detected between A. californica MNPV polyhedrin and any of the A. californica MNPV virion structural polypeptides present on either the virus isolated from <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> or A. californica MNPV extracellular virus from infected-cell cultures...|$|R
40|$|The serial {{passaging}} of baculoviruses in {{cell lines}} numerous times {{can result in}} a variety of mutations or defective viral populations becoming predominant in the cultures. The generation of these mutants during cell culture passage, also known as the passage effect, can seriously hinder the use of in vitro methods for large-scale production of baculoviruses for use as biopesticides. In an effort to develop a large-scale in vitro method of producing Helicoverpa armigera singly enveloped nucleopolyhedrovirus (HaSNPV), it was essential {{to determine whether or not}} the passage effect was evident when this virus is serially passaged in cell cultures. An isolate of HaSNPV was serially passaged in Helicoverpa zea cell, cultures up to 10 times. The production of <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> decreased with increasing passage number and there was evidence of defective viruses becoming predominant in cultures after 5 passages. The number of virions present within cross sections of passage 3 <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> was 1. 5 times higher than those from passage 10 <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> when quantified using electron microscopy. A laboratory bioassay showed that potencies of passage 3 isolates against H. armigera larvae were 8 times higher than potencies of passage 10 isolates. This study indicated that changes typical of the passage effect were evident when HaSNPV was serially passaged in H. zea cell cultures up to 10 times. (C) 1999 Academic Press...|$|R

40|$|Nudiviruses are arthropod-specific large {{double-stranded}} circular DNA viruses, {{related to}} baculoviruses, which replicate in {{the nucleus of}} the cells they infect. Up to date six fully sequenced nudiviral genomes are available in databases and protein profile from nudivirus particles were mainly characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, only few direct matches were completed between genomic and proteomic data to the exception of the major <b>occlusion</b> <b>body</b> protein from Penaeus monodon nudivirus (PmNV) and four nucleocapsid proteins from Helicoverpa zea nudivirus 2 (HzNV- 2). Function of predicted nudiviral proteins is still inferred from what is known from baculoviruses or endogenous nudiviruses (i. e. bracoviruses). Tipula oleracea nudivirus (ToNV) is the causative agent of crane fly nucleopolyhedrosis. With PmNV, ToNV is the second fully sequenced nudivirus to be described as forming <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> Protein profile revealed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE is quite similar to those observed for other nudiviruses with five major protein bands of about 75, 48, 35, 25 and 12 kDa. Proteomic analysis using on-line nanoflow liquid chromatography tandem high resolution mass spectrometry revealed ToNV <b>occlusion</b> <b>bodies</b> are composed of 52 viral proteins, the most abundant of which are the functional homolog of baculovirus polyhedrin/granulin and the homologs of three HzNV- 2 predicted proteins: the two virion structural proteins 34 K (Hz 2 V 052, the baculovirus capsid protein VP 39 homolog) and 11 K (Hz 2 V 025); and the hypothetical protein Hz 2 V 079, a newly identified nudivirus core gene product...|$|R
