40|$|The master thesis investigates how {{employees}} {{in a business}} experience the interaction in a <b>videoconference.</b> The problem formulating is supported by three guiding questions. 1. How do <b>videoconference</b> participants feel, the interaction {{is influenced by the}} fact, that the screen mediates the communication. 2. What role does the screen play in the communication between the <b>videoconference</b> participants? 3. Do the <b>videoconference</b> participants feel, that <b>videoconferences</b> have created a new culture for meetings? Ten employees from different companies were interviewed. Furthermore four expert were conducted with two experts in body language, one business psychologist and one distributor of <b>videoconferences.</b> Erving Goffmans’ theory about presentation of self in everyday life and Bruno Latours’ actor network theory form the theoretical base of the thesis. These theories along with the expert interviews are used in the analysis and interpretation of the informants’ statements. The thesis concludes, that {{it is important for the}} meetings’ flow that participants build a trust prior to joining a <b>videoconference</b> together. As the screen creates a physical and psychological distance participants find it difficult to decode others’ signals. It is not possible to build relationships through <b>videoconferences,</b> neither is it possible to build a trust. Thus <b>videoconferences</b> should be combined with physical meetings. Furthermore the videoconferences’ form is demanding and there is a need for strict management of the meeting. Lastly the thesis concludes,that companies should look at the videoconferences’ strengths and weaknesses, when determining whether or not to conduct a meeting via <b>videoconference.</b> As a final perspective on the subject, the thesis forms a list of practical advice for companies to use, when working with <b>videoconferences...</b>|$|R
40|$|The University of Porto (U. PORTO), {{through is}} New Technologies in Education (NTE) office has {{available}} since March 2005 a <b>Videoconference</b> Studio. This equipment {{is closely related}} do the dissemination of the <b>videoconference</b> technologies at U. PORTO. Only in the years of 2007 and 2008 this equipment has registered an increase of about 300 % on his usage. Several efforts were developed by the NTE team that contributed to this high usage. We highlight especially the fluidity on the service, the multifunctional usage, the acquisition {{and the development of}} knowledge in this field and the internationalization of this service. Various educations scenarios were implemented during these past years using the <b>videoconference</b> infrastructure. We highlight the pedagogical scenarios that became long structured pedagogical projects with more than a year long. We had the example of a curricular unit from a Master degree between our Faculty of Economics and ISEG (Lisbon). In this case we had about twenty students in our <b>Videoconference</b> room during two semesters and the teacher was in Lisbon. Another example was a Doctoral curricular unit that happen between our Faculty of Sciences, IST (Lisbon) and Carnegie Mellon University (USA). In this case we had a teacher and about five students in Lisbon, one class of about five students in the USA and one student in our <b>Videoconference</b> Studio. Recently it was implemented a new telepresence room (Douro HD Room) in last July 2009 and we will join this year a portable <b>videoconference</b> system that will offer a complete and different set of options in the <b>videoconference</b> field to all the academic community. With different characteristics between them, these three equipments from U. PORTO will allow an optimization in the <b>videoconference</b> service offer in all the University. This segmentation on the types of <b>videoconference</b> contents that these equipments can give can also boost the usage of these infrastructures in the University but can also boost the pedagogical use of the <b>videoconference</b> technologies in all the academic community. In the past years several activities supported by the NTE team were developed in collaboration with several international institutions and even with the integration in international organizations with high experience with <b>videoconference.</b> This integration permitted to increase the knowledge in this field. This internationalization component was very important to the high intensity in the usage of the <b>videoconference</b> infrastructure in the U. PORTO. We can say that with this offer and this experience it's possible to create even more opportunities of usage, especially in the <b>Videoconference</b> Studio of U. PORTO (due to the multifunctional characteristics) on the usage to diverse, structured and constant pedagogical scenarios that can last several years...|$|R

25|$|A {{videoconference}} {{system is}} generally higher cost than a videophone and deploys greater capabilities. A videoconference (also {{known as a}} videoteleconference) allows two or more locations to communicate via live, simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions.

Again, technology improvements have circumvented traditional definitions by allowing multiple party <b>videoconferencing</b> via web-based applications.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our experiences}} {{in an ongoing}} collaboration between our research group in Palo Alto and a similar group in Japan.

During the collaboration, we encountered a number of technical issues that caused communication breakdowns, and have taken various steps to improve the <b>videoconference</b> experience. In addition to improving the sound quality by using better microphone placements, we developed a number of systems that support different aspects of a <b>videoconference.</b> One of the new components is a system for panoramic two-way video communication that digitally combines images from an array of inexpensive video cameras. We also provided a means for the remote display of presentations, made design changes to our conference room, and added support for taking meeting minutes and for reviewing captured <b>videoconferences.</b> These changes have resulted in an improved <b>videoconference</b> experience and in a more effective collaboration with our Japanese colleagues...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} whether a rural continuing education (CE) program delivered by <b>videoconference</b> can enhance access to, and uptake of, CE among pharmacists and determine their satisfaction with <b>videoconference</b> for {{the delivery of}} CE. Method: A postal survey was sent to 33 registered pharmacists in south-west Victoria and south-east South Australia who had attended at least one <b>videoconference</b> CE session organised in that region. Results: Respondents worked in different areas of pharmacy, and 40 % worked {{in more than one}} area of pharmacy. The use of <b>videoconference</b> facilities has increased access to and participation in CE generally, and most participants (88 %) have found it to be an acceptable medium for delivery. Increased access to high-quality CE opportunities, and reduced travel time for CE were seen as the principal benefits of the medium. Negative aspects included technical glitches, organisational issues, and the time-lag in voice transmission. Overall, most participants were happy to receive a substantial proportion of their contact CE using this medium. Conclusions: <b>Videoconference</b> technology is a valuable tool for the delivery of carefully structured CE sessions in rural and remote areas with an appropriate information technology infrastructure...|$|R
