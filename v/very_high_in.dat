5|$|From {{the end of}} World War II {{until about}} 1971, the Bretton Woods system of semi-fixed {{exchange}} rates meant that competitive devaluation was not an option, {{which was one of}} the design objectives of the systems' architects.

5|$|Mass {{transfer}} {{came to an}} {{end when}} the surface layers of the mass-losing star were depleted, and the core slowly shrunk to a white dwarf. Now the stars peacefully orbit around each other. The long-term prospects for PSR B1620-26 b are poor, though. The triple system, which is much more massive than a typical isolated star in M4, is slowly drifting down into the core of the cluster, where the density of stars is <b>very</b> <b>high.</b> <b>In</b> a billion years or so, the triple will probably have another close encounter with a nearby star. The most common outcome of such encounters is that the lightest companion is ejected from the multiple star system. If this happens, PSR B1620-26 b will most likely be ejected completely from M4, and will spend the rest of its existence wandering alone in interstellar space as an interstellar planet.|$|E

25|$|A typical {{rocket engine}} {{can handle a}} {{significant}} fraction of its own mass in propellant each second, with the propellant leaving the nozzle at several kilometres per second.

This compares with other jet propulsion engines that can exceed 5 {{for some of the}} better engines.|$|E

25|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{nature of}} ferroelectric materials {{can be used}} to make capacitors with tunable capacitance. Typically, a ferroelectric capacitor simply consists of a pair of electrodes sandwiching a layer of ferroelectric material. The permittivity of ferroelectrics is not only tunable but commonly also <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> absolute value, especially when close to the phase transition temperature. Because of this, ferroelectric capacitors are small in physical size compared to dielectric (non-tunable) capacitors of similar capacitance.|$|E

These nurture high levels of phytoplankton with associated copepods and Antarctic krill, and resultant foodchains supporting fish, whales, seals, penguins, albatrosses and a wealth of other species.|$|E

25|$|Education is {{compulsory}} {{from the}} ages of six to 18, but most Flemings continue to study until around 23.

Flanders also scores <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> international comparative studies on education. Its secondary school students consistently rank among the top three for mathematics and science.
