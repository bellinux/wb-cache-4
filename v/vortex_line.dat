40|$|Recently the Kelvin wave {{cascade process}} in {{superfluid}} $^ 4 $He {{at very low}} temperatures was discussed. In this mechanism, {{the dynamics of the}} waves on the <b>vortex</b> <b>lines</b> plays an important role.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the existence of}} stationary states composed of <b>vortex</b> <b>lines</b> attached to planar dark solitons in scalar Bose-Einstein condensates. Dynamically stable states of this type are found at low values of the chemical potential in channeled condensates, where the long-wavelength instability of dark solitons is prevented. In oblate, harmonic traps, U-shaped <b>vortex</b> <b>lines</b> attached by both ends to a single planar soliton are shown to be long-lived states. Our results are reported for parameters typical of current experiments, and open up a way to explore the interplay of different topological structures. These configurations provide Dirichlet boundary conditions for <b>vortex</b> <b>lines</b> and thereby mimic open strings attached to D-branes in string theory. We show that these similarities can be formally established by mapping the Gross-Pitaevskii theory into a dual effective string theory for open strings via a boson-vortex duality in 3 + 1 dimensions. Combining a one-form gauge field living on the soliton plane which couples to the endpoints of <b>vortex</b> <b>lines</b> and a two-form gauge field which couples to <b>vortex</b> <b>lines,</b> we obtain a gauge-invariant dual action of open <b>vortex</b> <b>lines</b> with their endpoints attached to dark solitons.

50|$|According to Helmholtz's theorems, a <b>vortex</b> <b>line</b> cannot start or end in {{the fluid}} - except momentarily, in non-steady flow, while the vortex is forming or dissipating. In general, vortex lines (in particular, the axis line) are either closed loops or end at the {{boundary}} of the fluid.

A vortex tube whose vortex lines are all closed will be a closed torus-like surface.|$|E
50|$|In a {{stationary}} vortex, the typical streamline (a line that is everywhere tangent to the flow velocity vector) is a closed loop surrounding the axis; and each <b>vortex</b> <b>line</b> (a line that is everywhere tangent to the vorticity vector) is roughly {{parallel to the}} axis.

50|$|The {{core of a}} vortex in air is {{sometimes}} visible because of a plume of water vapor caused by condensation in the low pressure and low temperature of the core; the spout of a tornado is an example. When a <b>vortex</b> <b>line</b> ends at a boundary surface, the reduced pressure may also draw matter from that surface into the core. For example, a dust devil is a column of dust {{picked up by the}} core of an air vortex attached to the ground. A vortex that ends at the free surface of a body of water (like the whirlpool that often forms over a bathtub drain) may draw a column of air down the core. The forward vortex extending from a jet engine of a parked airplane can suck water and small stones into the core and then into the engine.|$|E
