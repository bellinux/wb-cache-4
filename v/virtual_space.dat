In pre-modern societies, space was the area in which one moved, time was the experience one had while moving. In modern societies, however, the social space is no longer confined by the boundaries set by the space in which one moves. One can now imagine what other spaces look like, even if he has never been there. In this regard, Giddens talks about <b>virtual</b> <b>space</b> and virtual time.

Previously built to serve a war-faring species, Hactar was tasked to build a supernova-bomb that would link the cores of every sun in the Universe together at the press of a button and cause {{the end of the}} Universe. Hactar purposely created a dud version of the weapon instead, causing his creators to pulverise him into dust, which thus became the dust cloud around Krikkit. However, Hactar was still able to function, though at a much weaker level. Trillian and Arthur speak to Hactar in a <b>virtual</b> <b>space</b> that he creates for them to explain himself. Hactar reveals that he spent eons creating the spaceship that crashed on Krikkit to inspire their xenophobia and incite them to go to war, also influencing their thoughts. However, when the Slo-Time envelope was activated, his control on the population waned. As he struggles to remain functional, Hactar apologises to Trillian and Arthur for his actions before they leave for their ship.|$|E

From the background of modern community theory the author explores the designation of <b>virtual</b> <b>spaces</b> as “virtual communities. ” Literature and research about <b>virtual</b> <b>spaces</b> indicates that they can provide many of the values thought be to inherent to community membership. The strong localized community on campus makes students hesitant in calling Facebook a “virtual community,” despite its strong integration with the face-to-face community itself.

The resulting parametric functions allow fast calculation of the coordinates of the points {{on the surface of}} the objects. We devise an algorithm which evaluates the coefficients of these functions in real time. Given the small size of the resulting formulas and interactive rates for their calculation, we are able to efficiently use such PDE-based models for making virtual objects in shared <b>virtual</b> <b>spaces.</b> We describe the modeling framework and illustrate the proposed theoretical concepts with our function-based extension of VRML and X 3 D.

40|$|A digital {{implementation}} of a phase sampling interferometer antenna system based on the Robust Symmetrical Number System (RSNS) is built using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) items. The RSNS-based direction finding (DF) system uses short baselines to achieve a high resolution DF capability in a physically compact system for use as stand-in sensors on unmanned aerial vehicles. The RSNS inherent integer Gray code property minimizes the possible encoding errors and adds a robustness {{to the accuracy of}} the estimated Angle of Arrival (AOA). A digital architecture using quadrature demodulators and real-time controllers provide grreater flexibility for signal processing and allows for the {{implementation of}} a new <b>virtual</b> <b>spacing</b> algorithm. The <b>virtual</b> <b>spacing</b> concept changes the RSNS moduli values to implement a <b>virtual</b> antenna <b>spacing</b> without having to physically change the antenna element spacing. This enables higher resolution DF in circumstances where the Signal-to-Noise Ratio is high enough to provide error free coding of the AOA. Two four element, digital 3 -channel interferometer prototype systems were constructed and tested in the NPS anechoic chamber. The first antenna array is designed using pairwise relatively prime (PRP) moduli. When an extension of the <b>virtual</b> <b>spacing</b> concept for application to N-channel systems was successfully resolved, a second 3 -channel array was built using non-PRP moduli for evaluating the performance of the <b>virtual</b> <b>spacing</b> concept. The simulated and experimental results, hardware implementation and testing procedures are presented in this thesis. Results for the first array show that the RSNS-based DF system is able to provide 0. 7 degree RMS resolution with a baseline of 66 cm. For the second <b>virtual</b> <b>spacing</b> array, the short physical baseline of 14 cm was sensitive to noise and antenna spacing errors...|$|R
