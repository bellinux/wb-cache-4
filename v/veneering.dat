These joints were strengthened using pegs, dowels and leather or cord lashings. Animal glue came to be used only in the New Kingdom period. Ancient Egyptians invented the art of <b>veneering</b> and used varnishes for finishing, though the composition of these varnishes is unknown. Although different native acacias were used, as was the wood from the local sycamore and tamarisk trees, deforestation in the Nile valley resulted in {{the need for the}} importation of wood, notably cedar, but also Aleppo pine, boxwood and oak, starting from the Second Dynasty.|$|E
500|$|Isaac Epstein married Dinah Hyman in Manchester in 1900. In 1901, Isaac and Dinah {{were living}} at 80 Walton Road, Liverpool with Isaac's sister Rachael Epstein, above the {{furniture}} dealership that he founded. Dinah and Isaac's third child was Harry Epstein, Brian Epstein's father. Eventually {{the family moved}} to a larger home at 27 Anfield Road, Liverpool. After Harry and his brother Leslie had joined the family firm, Isaac Epstein founded I. Epstein and Sons and enlarged his furniture business by taking over adjacent shops at 62/72 Walton Road to sell a range of other goods, such as musical instruments and household appliances. They called the expanding business NEMS (North End Music Stores), which offered lenient credit terms, and from which Paul McCartney's father once bought a piano. [...] Epstein's mother Malka (nicknamed [...] "Queenie" [...] by her family, as Malka means [...] "queen" [...] in Hebrew) was also involved in the Hyman furniture business, which also owned the Sheffield <b>Veneering</b> Company.|$|E

60|$|It {{is always}} {{noticeable}} {{at the table}} of the <b>Veneerings,</b> that no man troubles himself much about the <b>Veneerings</b> themselves, and that any one who has anything to tell, generally tells it to anybody else in preference.|$|R

2500|$|Mr and Mrs <b>Veneering</b> – a nouveaux-riches {{husband and}} wife whose main preoccupation is to advance in the social world. They invite {{influential}} people to their dinner parties where their furniture gleams with a sheen that they also put on to make themselves seem more impressive. They [...] "wear" [...] their acquaintances, their possessions, and their wealth like jewellery, {{in an attempt to}} impress those around them. <b>Veneering</b> eventually goes bankrupt and they retire to France to live on the jewels he bought for his wife.|$|E
2500|$|Born in Langenstein, Hesse, Germany, Pabst {{immigrated to}} the U.S. in 1849 and settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he would make his {{professional}} career. The excellence of his craftsmanship elevated him above his peers, as did the strongly architectonic (building-like) quality of his furniture designs—often massively scaled, with columns, pilasters, rounded and Gothic arches, bold carving and polychromatic decoration. He was a master at cameo-carving (intaglio) in wood [...] <b>veneering</b> a light-colored wood over a darker, then carving through to create a vivid contrast. Some pieces were adorned with decorative tiles, others with painted glass panels backed with reflective foil. Elaborate strap hinges and hardware were commonly used, and sometimes the furniture was ebonized. His Philadelphia shop grew to employ up to 50 workmen, but the company's records do not survive. Of the presumably thousands of pieces produced by his shop over half a century, only two are signed, and very few are documented. Therefore, identification of his works must be done through attribution.|$|E
2500|$|The spur to such {{commercial}} designs can {{be found}} in the [...] "free Renaissance" [...] style that was espoused by Charles Eastlake. In 1868 he published Hints on Household Taste in Furniture, Upholstery and other Details which was very influential in Britain and later in the United States, where the book was published in 1872. Although the archaeology of Mr. Eastlake's volume was always careful, most of the principles in it are beyond question, and can be generally stated in a few words. The Italianate style would have no carving or molding or other ornament glued on—such work must be done in the solid; no mitered joints, but joints made at the right angle, and secured by mortise, tenon and pin; woods in their native colour, and unvarnished, or else painted in flat colour, with a contrasting line and a stenciled ornament at the angles; unconcealed construction everywhere, and purposes plainly proclaimed; and with <b>veneering,</b> round corners and all curves weakening the grain of the wood being absolutely forbidden. The furniture that he thus proposed has straight, strong, squarely cut members equal to their intention. Its ornament is painted panels, porcelain plaques and tiles, metal trimmings, and conventionalized carvings in sunk relief, a part of the construction entering into the ornament, also in the shape of narrow striated strips of wood radiating in opposite lines, after a fashion not altogether unknown in the time of Henry III. It has the honesty and solidity, but not the attraction, of the Medieval; and if it is stiff and somewhat heavy, and fails entirely to please, it has yet a wholesome and healthy air.|$|E
60|$|Lady Tippins fancies she has {{collected}} the suffrages {{of the whole}} Committee (nobody dreaming of asking the <b>Veneerings</b> for their opinion), when, looking round the table through her eyeglass, she perceives Mr Twemlow with {{his hand to his}} forehead.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Possible! We have pretended {{well enough}} to one another. Can't we, united, pretend to the world? Agreed. Secondly, we owe the <b>Veneerings</b> a grudge, and we owe all other people the grudge of wishing them to be taken in, as we {{ourselves}} have been taken in. Agreed?' ...|$|R
60|$|He, too, in {{his best}} days, always lived with his characters;--and he, too, as he {{gradually}} ceased to have the power of doing so, ceased to charm. Though they are not human beings, we all remember Mrs. Gamp and Pickwick. The Boffins and <b>Veneerings</b> do not, I think, dwell {{in the minds of}} so many.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear,' says Mr <b>Veneering</b> to Mrs <b>Veneering,</b> {{with an air}} of much {{friendly}} interest, {{while the}} door stands open, 'the Podsnaps.' ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs <b>Veneering</b> welcomes {{her sweet}} Mr Twemlow. Mr <b>Veneering</b> welcomes his dear Twemlow. Mrs <b>Veneering</b> {{does not expect}} that Mr Twemlow can in nature care much for such insipid things as babies, but so old a friend must please to look at baby. 'Ah! You will know the friend of your family better, Tootleums,' says Mr <b>Veneering,</b> nodding emotionally at that new article, 'when you begin to take notice.' He then begs to make his dear Twemlow known to his two friends, Mr Boots and Mr Brewer--and clearly has no {{distinct}} idea which is which.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Veneering</b> {{then says}} to Mrs <b>Veneering,</b> 'We must work,' and throws {{himself into a}} Hansom cab. Mrs <b>Veneering</b> in the same moment relinquishes baby to Nurse; presses her aquiline hands upon her brow, to arrange the {{throbbing}} intellect within; orders out the carriage; and repeats in a distracted and devoted manner, compounded of Ophelia and any self-immolating female of antiquity you may prefer, 'We must work.' ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{evening the}} <b>Veneerings</b> give a banquet. Eleven {{leaves in the}} Twemlow; {{fourteen}} in company all told. Four pigeon-breasted retainers in plain clothes stand in line in the hall. A fifth retainer, proceeding up the staircase with a mournful air--as who should say, 'Here is another wretched creature come to dinner; such is life!'--announces, 'Mis-ter Twemlow!' ...|$|R
60|$|But, {{six o'clock}} in the evening finds the worthy little gentleman getting better, and also getting himself into his {{obsolete}} little silk stockings and pumps, for the wondering dinner at the <b>Veneerings.</b> And seven {{o'clock in the}} evening finds him trotting out into Duke Street, to trot to the corner and save a sixpence in coach-hire.|$|R
60|$|As a {{delicate}} concession to this unfortunately-born foreigner, Mr Podsnap, in receiving him, had presented {{his wife as}} 'Madame Podsnap;' also his daughter as 'Mademoiselle Podsnap,' with some inclination to add 'ma fille,' in which bold venture, however, he checked himself. The <b>Veneerings</b> being {{at that time the}} only other arrivals, he had added (in a condescendingly explanatory manner), 'Monsieur Vey-nair-reeng,' and had then subsided into English.|$|R
6000|$|Then pouncing upon Twemlow, {{who holds}} {{back with all}} his feeble might, he is haling him off to present him, as <b>Veneering,</b> to Mrs Podsnap, when the arrival of more guests unravels the mistake. Whereupon, having re-shaken hands with <b>Veneering</b> as <b>Veneering,</b> he re-shakes hands with Twemlow as Twemlow, and winds it all up to his own perfect {{satisfaction}} by saying to the last-named, 'Ridiculous opportunity--but so glad of it, I am sure!' ...|$|E
60|$|Why, {{of course}} <b>Veneering</b> knows that! Of course <b>Veneering</b> {{knows that if}} Podsnap chose to go there, he would be there, in a space of time that might be stated by the light and thoughtless as a jiffy.|$|E
60|$|Mrs <b>Veneering,</b> always {{charmed by}} this {{rattling}} sylph, cries. 'Oh yes! Do let us resolve ourselves into a Committee {{of the whole}} House! So delicious!' <b>Veneering</b> says, 'As many as are of that opinion, say Aye,--contrary, No--the Ayes have it.' But nobody takes the slightest notice of his joke.|$|E
60|$|The Lammles were {{so fond of}} {{the dear}} <b>Veneerings</b> {{that they could not}} for some time detach {{themselves}} from those excellent friends; but at length, either a very open smile on Mr Lammle's part, or a very secret elevation of one of his gingerous eyebrows--certainly the one or the other--seemed to say to Mrs Lammle, 'Why don't you play?' And so, looking about her, she saw Miss Podsnap, and seeming to say responsively, 'That card?' and to be answered, 'Yes,' went and sat beside Miss Podsnap.|$|R
60|$|Then the {{magnificent}} capstan! The pride and {{glory of the}} whole ship's company, the constant care and dandled darling of the cook, whose duty it was to keep it polished like a teapot; {{and it was an}} object of distant admiration to the steerage passengers. Like a parlor center- table, it stood full {{in the middle of the}} quarter-deck, radiant with brazen stars, and variegated with diamond-shaped <b>veneerings</b> of mahogany and satin wood. This was the captain's lounge, and the chief mate's secretary, in the bar-holes keeping paper and pencil for memorandums.|$|R
2500|$|Mr Melvin Twemlow – the well-connected {{friend of}} the <b>Veneerings,</b> who is often {{cultivated}} for his supposed influence with powerful people, such as Lord Snigsworth. Mrs Lammle tells him about their plot to marry Georgiana Podsnap and Fledgeby, to whom Twemlow owes money. Though Twemlow is introduced as being as insensible as a table at the Veneerings' dinner party, he comes to reflect a wise way of thinking. His wearing of a collar and cravat creates [...] "picturesque and archaic" [...] impression, and he proves himself a [...] "true gentleman in his response to Wrayburn's marriage".|$|R
60|$|To whom Mrs <b>Veneering</b> incoherently communicates, {{how that}} <b>Veneering</b> {{has been offered}} Pocket-Breaches; how {{that it is the}} time for {{rallying}} round; how that <b>Veneering</b> has said 'We must work'; how that she is here, as a wife and mother, to entreat Lady Tippins to work; how that the carriage is at Lady Tippins's disposal for purposes of work; how that she, proprietress of said bran new elegant equipage, will return home on foot--on bleeding feet if need be--to work (not specifying how), until she drops by the side of baby's crib.|$|E
60|$|It is {{questionable}} whether any man quite relishes being mistaken {{for any other}} man; but, Mr <b>Veneering</b> having this very evening set up the shirt-front of the young Antinous in new worked cambric just come home, {{is not at all}} complimented by being supposed to be Twemlow, who is dry and weazen and some thirty years older. Mrs <b>Veneering</b> equally resents the imputation of being the wife of Twemlow. As to Twemlow, he is so sensible of being a much better bred man than <b>Veneering,</b> that he considers the large man an offensive ass.|$|E
60|$|Now, Twemlow having {{undergone}} this terrific experience, having likewise {{noted the}} fusion of Boots in Brewer and Brewer in Boots, and having further observed that of the remaining seven guests four discrete characters enter with wandering eyes and wholly declined to commit themselves as to which is <b>Veneering,</b> until <b>Veneering</b> has them in his grasp;--Twemlow having profited by these studies, finds his brain wholesomely hardening as he approaches the conclusion that he really is Veneering's oldest friend, when his brain softens again and all is lost, through his eyes encountering <b>Veneering</b> and the large man linked together as twin brothers in the back drawing-room near the conservatory door, and through his ears informing him in the tones of Mrs <b>Veneering</b> that the same large man is to be baby's godfather.|$|E
2500|$|Mortimer Lightwood – is a lawyer, {{who is an}} {{acquaintance}} of the <b>Veneerings</b> {{and a friend of}} Eugene Wrayburn. Lightwood acts as the [...] "storyteller" [...] and it is through him that the reader and the other characters learn about Harmon's will. However, under the [...] "mask of irony" [...] he assumes in telling his stories, he feels true friendship for Eugene, respect for Twemlow, and concern for the issues in which he is involved. In addition, he also serves as the [...] "commentator and a voice of conscience" [...] with sarcasm sometimes covering his concern. Through Lightwood's reason and advice, the reader is better able to judge the characters' actions.|$|R
60|$|The next week's {{books of}} the Insolvent Fates, however, being not yet opened, there is the usual rush to the <b>Veneerings,</b> {{of the people who}} go to their house to dine with one another and not with them. There is Lady Tippins. There are Podsnap the Great, and Mrs Podsnap. There is Twemlow. There are Buffer, Boots, and Brewer. There is the Contractor, who is Providence to five hundred {{thousand}} men. There is the Chairman, travelling three thousand miles per week. There is the brilliant genius who turned the shares into that remarkably exact sum of three hundred and seventy five thousand pounds, no shillings, and nopence.|$|R
60|$|Breakfast announced. Everything {{on table}} showy and gaudy, {{but with a}} self-assertingly {{temporary}} and nomadic air on the decorations, as boasting {{that they will be}} much more showy and gaudy in the palatial residence. Mr Lammle's own particular servant behind his chair; the Analytical behind <b>Veneering's</b> chair; instances in point that such servants fall into two classes: one mistrusting the master's acquaintances, and the other mistrusting the master. Mr Lammle's servant, of the second class. Appearing to be lost in wonder and low spirits because the police are so long in coming to take his master up on some charge of the first magnitude.|$|R
6000|$|A {{touching}} little {{incident is}} related by Mrs <b>Veneering,</b> {{in the course}} of the evening. Mrs <b>Veneering</b> is habitually disposed to be tearful, and has an extra disposition that way after her late excitement. Previous to withdrawing from the dinner-table with Lady Tippins, she says, in a pathetic and physically weak manner: ...|$|E
60|$|Behoves Mortimer Lightwood, therefore, {{to answer}} a dinner card from Mr and Mrs <b>Veneering</b> {{requesting}} the honour, and to signify that Mr Mortimer Lightwood {{will be happy to}} have the other honour. The Veneerings have been, as usual, indefatigably dealing dinner cards to Society, and whoever desires to take a hand had best be quick about it, for it is written in the Books of the Insolvent Fates that <b>Veneering</b> shall make a resounding smash next week. Yes. Having found out the clue to that great mystery how people can contrive to live beyond their means, and having over-jobbed his jobberies as legislator deputed to the Universe by the pure electors of Pocket-Breaches, it shall come to pass next week that <b>Veneering</b> will accept the Chiltern Hundreds, that the legal gentleman in Britannia's confidence will again accept the Pocket-Breaches Thousands, and that the Veneerings will retire to Calais, there to live on Mrs Veneering's diamonds (in which Mr <b>Veneering,</b> as a good husband, has from time to time invested considerable sums), and to relate to Neptune and others, how that, before <b>Veneering</b> retired from Parliament, the House of Commons was composed of himself and the six hundred and fifty-seven dearest and oldest friends he had in the world. It shall likewise come to pass, at as nearly as possible the same period, that Society will discover that it always did despise <b>Veneering,</b> and distrust <b>Veneering,</b> and that when it went to Veneering's to dinner it always had misgivings--though very secretly at the time, it would seem, and in a perfectly private and confidential manner.|$|E
60|$|The legal {{gentleman in}} Britannia's {{confidence}} going straight from that lady to <b>Veneering,</b> thus commissioned, <b>Veneering</b> declares himself highly flattered, but requires breathing time to ascertain 'whether his friends will rally round him.' Above all things, he says, it behoves {{him to be}} clear, at a crisis of this importance, 'whether his friends will rally round him.' The legal gentleman, {{in the interests of}} his client cannot allow much time for this purpose, as the lady rather thinks she knows somebody prepared to put down six thousand pounds; but he says he will give <b>Veneering</b> four hours.|$|E
60|$|Lady Tippins partaking plentifully of {{the fruits}} of the earth (including grape-juice in the category) becomes livelier, and applies herself to elicit sparks from Mortimer Lightwood. It is always {{understood}} among the initiated, that that faithless lover must be planted at table opposite to Lady Tippins, who will then strike conversational fire out of him. In a pause of mastication and deglutition, Lady Tippins, contemplating Mortimer, recalls that it was at our dear <b>Veneerings,</b> and {{in the presence of a}} party who are surely all here, that he told them his story of the man from somewhere, which afterwards became so horribly interesting and vulgarly popular.|$|R
60|$|While these occurrences were in progress, Mrs Lammle {{made the}} {{discovery}} that Bella had a fascinating influence over her. The Lammles, originally presented by the dear <b>Veneerings,</b> visited the Boffins on all grand occasions, and Mrs Lammle had not previously found this out; but now the knowledge came upon her all at once. It was a most extraordinary thing (she said to Mrs Boffin); she was foolishly susceptible {{of the power of}} beauty, but it wasn't altogether that; she never had been able to resist a natural grace of manner, but it wasn't altogether that; it was more than that, and there was no name for the indescribable extent and degree to which she was captivated by this charming girl.|$|R
60|$|Mr and Mrs Podsnap {{are of the}} company, and the Fathers descry in Mrs Podsnap a fine woman. She is {{consigned}} to a Father--Boots's Father, who employs five hundred thousand men--and is brought to anchor on <b>Veneering's</b> left; thus affording opportunity to the sportive Tippins on his right (he, as usual, being mere vacant space), to entreat to be told something about those loves of Navvies, and whether they really do live on raw beefsteaks, and drink porter out of their barrows. But, in spite of such little skirmishes it is {{felt that this was}} to be a wondering dinner, and that the wondering must not be neglected. Accordingly, Brewer, as the man who has the greatest reputation to sustain, becomes the interpreter of the general instinct.|$|R
