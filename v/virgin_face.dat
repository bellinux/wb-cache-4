60|$|The smooth, moon-like, expressionless <b>virgin</b> <b>face,</b> rather {{pale and}} touching, rather frightened, of the girl-child. A perfect face from a mediaeval picture. It moves one strangely. Why? It is so unconscious, {{as we are}} conscious. Like a little muted animal it sits there, in distress. She {{is going to be}} sick. She goes into the {{corridor}} and is sick--very sick, leaning her head like a sick dog on the window-ledge. Jupiter towers above her--not unkind, and apparently feeling no repugnance. The physical convulsion of the girl does not affect him as it affects us. He looks on unmoved, merely venturing to remark that she had eaten too much before coming on to the train. An obviously true remark. After which he comes and talks a few common-places to me. By and by the girl-child creeps in again and {{sits on the edge of}} the seat facing Juno. But no, says Juno, if she is sick she will be sick over me. So Jupiter accommodatingly changes places with the girl-child, who is thus next to me. She sits on the edge of the seat with folded little red hands, her face pale and expressionless. Beautiful the thin line of her nut-brown eyebrows, the dark lashes of the silent, pellucid dark eyes. Silent, motionless, like a sick animal.|$|E

50|$|The Bleeding Nun {{also appears}} in the subplot of Raymond and Agnes and epitomizes the sin of erotic desires. Raymond {{mistakes}} her for his lover, Agnes, because she is veiled and he cannot see her face. The veil “conceals and inhibits sexuality comes by the same gesture to represent it.” Both Antonia and Matilda are veiled to protect their virginity and innocence and {{it is expected that}} Agnes also covers her face for this reason when she meets Raymond. However, the removal of the veil reveals the Bleeding Nun, dead and punished because of her sins. While she was alive, she was a prostitute and a murderer before she was murdered by her lover. Her story is the first we receive of how giving in to sexual desires leads to death and eternal unrest. Raymond expects to find Agnes’ beautiful, <b>virgin</b> <b>face</b> beneath the veil, but instead finds death. Her unveiling connects the loss of virginity and the giving in to sexual desires with death and punishment. Both the Bleeding Nun and Ambrosio begin pious but then fall prey to their sexual desires. Ambrosio has already given into his desire for Matilda and the story of the Bleeding Nun told in the subplot foreshadows his further downfall with Antonia and his eternal punishment {{in the hands of the}} devil.|$|E

50|$|The {{composition}} of depictions is very consistent, with Gabriel, normally {{but not always}} standing on the left, <b>facing</b> the <b>Virgin,</b> who is generally seated or kneeling, at least in later depictions. Typically Gabriel is shown in near-profile, while the <b>Virgin</b> <b>faces</b> more to the front. She at least is usually shown indoors, or in a porch of some kind, in which case Gabriel may be outside the building entirely, in the Renaissance often in a garden, which refers to the hortus conclusus, sometimes an explicit setting for Annunciations. The building is sometimes clearly the Virgin's home, but is also often intended to represent the Jerusalem Temple, as some legendary accounts placed the scene there. The Virgin may be shown reading, as medieval legend represented her as a considerable scholar, or engaged in a domestic task, often reflecting another legend that {{she was one of}} a number of virgins asked to weave a new Veil of the Temple. Late medieval commentators distinguished several phases of the Virgin's reaction to the appearance of Gabriel and the news, from initial alarm at the sudden vision, followed by reluctance to fulfill the role, to a final acceptance. These are reflected in art by the Virgin's posture and expression.|$|R
40|$|Interspecific mating {{can cause}} severe fitness costs {{due to the}} fact that hybrids are often {{non-viable}} or less fit. Thus, theory predicts the selection of traits that lessen reproductive interactions between closely related sympatric species. Males of the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis differ from all other Nasonia species by an additional sex pheromone component, but the ecological selective forces underlying this pheromone diversification are unknown. Here we present data from lab experiments suggesting that costly interspecific sexual interactions with the sympatric species N. giraulti might have been responsible for the pheromone evolution and some courtship-related behavioural adaptations in N. vitripennis. Most N. giraulti females are inseminated already within the host, but N. giraulti males still invest in costly sex pheromones after emergence. Furthermore, they do not discriminate between N. vitripennis females and conspecifics during courtship. Therefore, N. vitripennis females, most of which emerge as <b>virgins,</b> <b>face</b> the risk of mating with N. giraulti resulting in costly all-male broods due to Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility. As a counter adaptation, young N. vitripennis females discriminate against N. giraulti males using the more complex conspecific sex pheromone and reject most of them during courtship. With increasing age, however, N. vitripennis females become less choosy, but often compensate mating errors by re-mating with a conspecific. By doing so, they can principally avoid suboptimal offspring sex ratios, but a microcosm experiment suggests that under more natural conditions N. vitripennis females cannot completely avoid fitnes...|$|R

50|$|The present church, {{begun in}} 1732, {{was built in}} the Mexican baroque style. The statue of the Virgin was {{installed}} in 1769 and the bell towers were completed in 1790. In 1972 the church was recognized as a basilica. Inside the church, upon a platform with an upturned crescent moon, stands the statue of the <b>Virgin.</b> The <b>face</b> is dark in color, the eyes widely spaced and the traits somewhat aquiline. About 20 inches (50 cm) tall, the statue was made by the Purépecha Indians of the state of Michoacán using an indigenous technique called titzingueni, in which a frame of wood is covered by a paste of corn pith and orchid juice, and then coated with gesso and painted. Similar statues are still venerated in other parts of Jalisco, including many different of statue but different name such as Nuestra Señora de Los Altos (Our Lady of Los Altos) in town of Atotonilco El Alto and San Francisco de Asís, Jalisco.; Nuestra Señora de la Salud (Our Lady of Health) in Patzcuaro and the Virgin of Zapopan in the city of Guadalajara. Sometime in the late 16th or early 17th century the statue was modernized by being enclosed in a frame and draped with clothing. The Virgin’s hands are joined in prayer, she has long brown hair, and wears a white gown and blue robe. The statue’s body is covered with a golden crown in Byzantine style.Above the image are two angels of silver, supporting between them a silver banner with the Latin inscription in blue enamel: Mater Immaculata ora pro nobis (Immaculate Mother pray for us).|$|R

5000|$|Raphael reused {{in many of}} his {{sketches}} {{the staff}} in his studio as models, so call “garazone” who were not always used in the final versions of the painting. This is quite evident in the 'Borghese Deposition' study currently in the British Museum suggested to be from around 1508, in which the draped person carrying the torso of the Christ was not used in the final version. This garzone {{appears to be in}} the 'Adoration of the Shepherds' [...] This specific garzone, identified by his distinct nose and ear, his beard, his hairstyle, and even his clothing. This same garzone seems also to appear also in the Death of Adonis', from ca 1508, in the Ashmoelan museum, carrying the torso of Adonis. The distinct nose is visible, along with the beard and even the head-band. Interesting is however the verso side of this drawing, referred to as the 'Adam Tempted', in which an often uncommented sketch of an infant reclining backward and resting on his left arm, while lifting, {{what seems to be a}} drape, or holding the hand of the virgin, with his right arm. Johannides mentions that this child is taken from Bellini’s Madonna with a Sleeping Child (Boston Gardner Museum). However this small figure also bears however a likeness to the infant Jesus in the 'Adoration of the Shepherds'. In the 'Adoration of the Shepherds', the child has “woken up” and turned its head towards the virgin, who no longer supports his head, she has retracted her hand to her bosom. An addition Garzone is perhaps the <b>Virgin,</b> whos distinct <b>face</b> can be recognized in the 'Madonna of the goldfinch'. The likeness is so striking that it is hard to deny that it would be based on the same person.The reuse of ideas and images was also a distinct trait of Raphael, as Ames-Lewis discusses, Raphael was under enormous pressure and needed to optimized economize within his resources. The reused of figures and Ideas could come many years later, of which Raphael either pulled from sketches or from is memory. The technique used by Raphael is to do a quick preparatory stylus sketch on prepared paper before working in chalk. Raphael reused his figures, according to Ames- Lewis: “A figure which he studied carefully for use in one context but the rejected as no longer suitable to the way the design had evolved, may reappear in another similar context.” [...] Such a figure is again the kneeling shepherd, whom Raphael, seems to have converted to the 'lame man', in the 'Healing of the Lame Man', from 1516, as seen in the cartoon, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. One distinct feature is the barrel around the waist. Such a barrel does also appear in the Metropolitan engraving of the 'Adoration of the Shepherds' by School Marcantonio Raimondo, curisouly attributed to have been engraved in Bologna, but after a design by Raphael.|$|R
