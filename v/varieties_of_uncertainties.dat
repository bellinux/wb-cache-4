40|$|Abstract—Wireless sensor {{networks}} are envisioned {{to be an}} integral part of cyber-physical systems, yet wireless {{networks are}} inherently dynamic and come with <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> One such uncertainty is wireless communication itself which assumes complex spatial and temporal dynamics. For dependable and predictable performance, therefore, link estimation has become a basic element of wireless network routing. Several approaches using broadcast beacons and/or unicast MAC feedback have been proposed in the past years, but there still lacks as a systematic characterization of the drawbacks and sources of errors in beaconbased link estimation in low-power wireless networks, which leads to ad hoc usage of beacons in routing. Using a testbed of 98 XSM motes (an enhanced version of MICA 2 motes), we characterize the negative impact that link layer retransmission and trafficinduced interference have on the accuracy of beacon-based link estimation, and we show that data-driven link estimation and routing achieves higher event reliability (e. g., by up to 18. 75 %) and transmission efficiency (e. g., by up to a factor of 1. 96) than beacon-based approaches. These findings provide solid evidence for the necessity of data-driven link estimation and demonstrate the importance of addressing the drawbacks of beacon-based link estimation when designing protocols for low-power wireless networks of cyber-physical systems.
