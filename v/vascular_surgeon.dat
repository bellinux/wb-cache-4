500|$|In 2008, <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeon</b> Paolo Zamboni {{suggested}} that MS involves a vascular process {{he referred to}} as chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), in which veins from the brain are constricted. He found CCSVI in all patients with MS in his study, performed a surgical procedure, later called in the media [...] "liberation procedure" [...] to correct it and claimed that 73% of participants improved. This theory received important attention {{in the media and}} among MS patients, specially in Canada. Concern has been raised with Zamboni's research as it was neither blinded nor controlled, and additionally its assumptions about the pathophisiology of the disease may not be backed by known data. Also further studies have either not found a relationship or found a much less strong one. This has raised serious objections to the hypothesis of CCSVI originating MS. The [...] "liberation procedure" [...] has been criticized for possibly resulting in serious complications and deaths while its benefits have not been proven. Currently it is recommended not to use the proposed treatment unless its effectiveness is confirmed by controlled studies. Research on CCSVI has been fast tracked but researchers have been unable to confirm whether CCSVI has a role in causing MS.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Although {{international}} guidelines {{state that}} supervised exercise therapy (SET) {{should be offered}} to all patients with intermittent claudication (IC), SET appears to be underutilised in clinical practice. The {{aim of this study}} was to document current opinions of Dutch <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons</b> on SET as treatment option for peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). Materials and methods: <b>Vascular</b> <b>surgeons</b> and fellows in vascular surgery were asked to complete a 24 -question survey either at the 2011 Annual Meeting of the Dutch Society for Vascular Surgery or online. Results: Ninety-one participants, including 83 <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons</b> (51 % of all Dutch <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons),</b> completed the survey. The respondents would refer 75. 4 % of newly diagnosed patients with IC for SET. SET was considered less useful in patients with IC and major (cardiopulmonary) co-morbidity or a significant iliac artery stenosis. In critical limb ischaemia, the combination of SET and angioplasty was considered useful in 71. 9 %. Respondents regarded patient satisfaction (63. 3 %) and improvement in pain-free or maximal walking ability (26. 6 %) as clinically most relevant goals of SET. Most (84. 4 %) agreed that SET should also include lifestyle management. Conclusion: Although the vast majority of Dutch <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons</b> consider SET as an important treatment option for PAOD, SET should receive more emphasis in clinical practice since arguments not to refer for SET are outdated.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Work {{posture and}} {{occupation}} {{are among the}} most controversial predisposing factors associated with venous disease. We examined the distribution and extent of venous reflux in the lower extremities of symptom-free <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons,</b> who were typically classified as leading a life of prolonged standing, in comparison to a group of symptom-free volunteers. Methods: In this prospective study (January 1991 to April 1994), the venous system in the lower limb veins of 28 <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons</b> (56 limbs) and 25 normal volunteers (50 limbs) was examined by color-flow duplex imaging. The two groups were matched for age (29 to 45 years) and sex (all men). Subjects with clinical signs and symptoms of venous disease, history of deep or superficial vein thrombosis, or previous venous operation or injection sclerotherapy {{were not included in the}} study (12 <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons).</b> Results: Venous reflux was detected in 29 limbs of <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons</b> (52 %) and in 16 limbs of the control group (32 %) (chi-squared test = 4. 232, p = 0. 039). In the latter, superficial venous incompetence was detected in 9 of 50 limbs (18 %), deep venous or perforator incompetence in 3 of 50 limbs (6 %), and venous incompetence involving both the superficial and deep systems in 4 of 50 limbs (8 %). In the group of <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons,</b> reflux in the superficial veins was seen in 22 of 56 limbs (39 %), in the deep and or perforating veins in 4 of 56 limbs (7 %), and in both the superficial and deep veins in 3 of 56 limbs (5 %). Superficial venous reflux was more frequently encountered in the limbs of 45 % of <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons</b> (25 of 56) than in the limbs of the control subjects 26 % (13 of 50) (chi-squared test = 3. 99, p = 0. 047). Distal long saphenous vein reflux alone accounted for 39 % (5 of 13) of any superficial venous incompetence in the limbs of the control subjects, and was higher, at 48 % (12 / 25), in the <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons.</b> Reflux in the gastrocnemial veins was equally distributed between the limbs of the control subjects (10 %) and the <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons</b> (11 %). Conclusions: Venous reflux was more frequently seen among symptom-free <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons</b> than normal individuals of a nonmedical vocation. The superficial system was by far the most common site of venous incompetence in both groups. Below-knee-long saphenous vein reflux in any combination was present in more than 75 % of the limbs with superficial venous incompetence. (J VASC SURG 1995; 22 : 150 - 4. ...|$|R

40|$|Claudication {{distance}} and maximum walking distance are both measures of disability. Estimates of the distances which {{a patient with}} intermittent claudication can walk are commonly used by <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons</b> as surrogate measures of handicap. We studied how accurately distance was estimated by 70 patients with intermittent claudication, and by 100 British <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons.</b> Patients and <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons</b> estimated actual distances of 30 m and 34 m, respectively.

Claudicants' errors can easily be eliminated by accurate and appropriate measurement of claudication and maximum walking distances but interpretation of the data by surgeons is dependent on their own ability to estimate distance.

40|$|ObjectiveOutcomes in the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST) did {{not differ}} between carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for the {{composite}} primary end point of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), or death during the periprocedural period or ipsilateral stroke within 4 years. Rigorous credentialing and training of interventionists, including <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons,</b> were required for the randomization phase of CREST. Because the lead-in phase of CREST had suggested higher perioperative risks after CAS performed by <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons,</b> {{the purpose of this}} analysis was to examine differences in outcomes after randomization between CAS and CEA performed by <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons.</b> MethodsCREST is a prospective randomized controlled trial with blinded end point adjudication. <b>Vascular</b> <b>surgeons</b> performed 237 (21 %) of the CAS procedures and 765 (65 %) of the CEA procedures among 2320 patients who received their assigned treatment. Proportional hazards analyses were used to estimate the relative efficacy of CAS vs CEA for the composite primary end point and also for stroke and death. ResultsAmong 2502 randomized patients, 1321 (53 %) were symptomatic and 1181 (47 %) were asymptomatic. For procedures performed exclusively by <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons,</b> the primary end point {{did not differ}} between CAS and CEA at 4 -year follow-up (6. 2 % vs 5. 6 %, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 1. 30; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 70 - 2. 41; P =. 41) In this subgroup, the periprocedural stroke and death rates were higher after CAS than CEA for symptomatic patients (6. 1 % vs 1. 3 %; P = . 01). Asymptomatic patients also had slightly higher stroke and death rates after CAS (2. 6 % vs 1. 1 %; P =. 20), although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Conversely, cranial nerve injuries (0. 0 % vs 5. 0 %; P <. 001) were less frequent after CAS than CEA. The MI rates were slightly lower after CAS (1. 3 % vs 2. 6 %; P =. 24). In performing CAS, vascular surgeons had outcomes for the periprocedural primary end point comparable to the outcomes of all interventionists (HR, 0. 99;  95 % CI, 0. 50 - 2. 00) after adjusting for age, sex, and symptomatic status. <b>Vascular</b> <b>surgeons</b> also had similar results after CEA for the periprocedural primary end point compared with other surgeons (HR, 0. 73; 95 % CI, 0. 42 - 1. 27). ConclusionsWhen performed by surgeons, CAS and CEA have similar net outcomes, although the periprocedural risks vary (lower stroke with CEA and lower MI with CAS). These data suggest that appropriately trained <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons</b> may safely offer both CEA and CAS for the prevention of stroke. The remarkably low stroke and death rates after CEA performed by <b>vascular</b> <b>surgeons</b> in CREST, particularly among symptomatic patients, represent the best outcomes ever reported after carotid interventions from a randomized controlled trial.
