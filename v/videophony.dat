40|$|We {{present a}} camera-projection system for single- or multiparty {{telepresence}} {{which allows for}} correct eye gaze, and unlike standard <b>videophony,</b> provides {{a great deal of}} spatial context. The unique feature of our system is a combination of omnidirectional video capture and display from corresponding projection centers. In essence, this creates a virtual overlap between the screen and the camera, which results in the participant looking directly into the camera whilst looking at the display. The novelty in this approach is that we correct eye gaze without the need of interpolating multiple views. With a given external calibration of the camera-projector setup, the mapping used for this system has to be calculated only once. This makes it possible for the algorithm to be implemented on commodity hardware and the GPU...|$|E
40|$|In a satiric {{chapter of}} David Foster Wallace’s novel Infinite Jest, a mock media expert reports how American {{consumers}} {{of the near}} future recoil from a new communication device known as “videophony ” {{and return to the}} voice-only telephone of the Bell Era. This article explores the said chapter in the framework of media theories reading the telephone as a “synecdoche of technology, ” considering Wallace’s vision of <b>videophony’s</b> rise and fall in a future society from two angles: It discusses the antitechnological bent of the chapter against the background of other visions of future media in 1990 s American fiction and it foregrounds the segment’s emphasis on solipsism as a destructive force in all forms of communication. The article argues that Infinite Jest moves beyond questions relevant only to the (video) telephone itself. Rather, Wallace’s novel contrasts literary communication—complex, multilayered, at times monumental—with discourses and practices overly optimistic with regard to the facility of mediated interactions per se...|$|R

Sc. Maunu Holma This master's thesis {{concentrates}} on blocking probability calculations in UMTS Radio Access network (UTRAN). UTRAN {{is a special}} part of the future Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS), enabling a large variety of innovative services to be offered to the mobile phone users, for instance <b>videophony</b> and mobile high speed internet browsing. Blocking means that the end user asks network resources for a connection that the network can not admit. The network has reserved all its resources and wants to keep the quality of all its existing connections. The basic technology inside the UTRAN is Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). It is a packet data technology supporting classificati [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Future {{high-speed}} computer communication {{networks are}} expected to utilize Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology. In order to broadly deploy ATM-based networks, numerous congestion control mechanisms are presently being developed by the industry and research community alike. In this paper, we propose a general method to evaluate {{the performance of a}} given congestion control scheme by observing the throughput of a connection. This method was used and shown to be effective in testing the performance of credit-based flow control implemented in a high speed network testbed. We present the results from experiments conducted in a wide area communication environment. 1 Introduction Communication networks for the mid- 1990 s and beyond {{are expected to}} support a wide variety of services, from the transmission of voice, video and data to new, commercially attractive services such as high-definition TV, high quality <b>videophony,</b> high speed data transfer, video on demand, etc. [1] [2].

40|$|In the paper, {{our high}} {{performance}} significance-linked connected component analysis (SLCCA) image compression algorithm is extended to three-dimensional wavelet coding {{resulting in a}} highly efficient and scalable video codec termed 3 DSLCCA. Advantageous features of 3 DSLCCA include low computational complexity, rate, spatial, temporal, and SNR scalability, and prevention of error propagation {{at the price of}} acceptable degradation in both objective and subjective quality when compared to the state-of-the-art H. 263 standard. INTRODUCTION Very low bit rate video coding has triggered intensive research in both academia and industry. The adopted ITU-T H. 263 Recommendation which is specifically tailored for very low bit rate video coding [1] is the first standard to break the 64 k bits-per-second (bps) barrier in audio-visual communications. The main application areas of H. 263 are videoconferencing and <b>videophony.</b> Although H. 263 provides acceptable visual quality, its widespread use is limite [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the progress in developing a socially assistive home robot companion for elderly people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) living alone at home. The spectrum of required assistive functionalities of such a robot companion is broad and reaches from reminding functions (e. g. taking medication or drinking) and cognitive stimulation exercises, via mobile <b>videophony</b> with relatives or caregivers, up to the detection and evaluation of critical situations, like falls. The paper is addressing several aspects of our work as part of the European FP 7 project ”CompanionAble”, as for example the developed robot hardware and its software and control architecture, the implemented skills for robust user detection and tracking and user-centered navigation in the home environment, and reports on already conducted and still ongoing functionality testings and pending usability studies with the end-user target groups (the elderly, relatives, caregivers).

40|$|Power {{consumption}} {{has emerged}} as an important constraint {{in the design of}} mobile video encoders. As motion estimation accounts {{for the majority of the}} total computations involved in video encoding, the algorithm and architecture used affect the quality and power levels of the final solution. In this paper, we present a block matching motion estimation algorithm whose computations are content complexity adaptive. The basic framework used is the multi-resolution mean pyramid technique. The algorithm is made macroblock adaptive by dynamically varying the number of candidate motion vectors passed to lower levels, depending on the frequency characteristics of the macroblock being matched and the complexity in the sequence for such characteristics. We use the concept of a deviation pyramid in order to estimate the macroblock frequency characteristics. Simulation results show that for typical <b>videophony</b> sequences, the algorithm reduces computational complexity by a factor ranging from 15. 5 to 74. 0, while maintaining PSNR values close to that obtained by using the full-search block matching algorithm. Simple operations are used in the algorithm to ensure applicability of the proposed algorithm for hardware implementation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Methods of {{deformable}} appearance {{models are}} useful for realistically modelling shapes and textures of visual objects for reconstruction. A first application can be the fine analysis of face gestures and expressions from videos, as deformable appearance models {{make it possible to}} automatically and robustly locate several points of interest in face images. That opens development prospects of technologies in many applications like video coding of faces for <b>videophony,</b> animation of synthetic faces, word visual recognition, expressions and emotions analysis, tracking and recognition of faces. However, these methods are not very robust to variations in the illumination conditions, which are expectable in non constrained conditions. This article describes a robust preprocessing method designed to enhance the performances of deformable models methods in the case of lighting variations. The proposed preprocessing is applied to the Active Appearance Models (AAM). More precisely, the contribution consists in replacing texture images (pixels) by distance maps as input of the deformable appearance models methods. The distance maps are images containing information about the distance between edges in the original object images, which enhance the robustness of the AAMs models against lighting variations. ...|$|E
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Flexibility and {{efficiency}} of coding, content extraction, and content-based search are key research topics {{in the field of}} interactive multimedia. Ongoing ISO MPEG- 4 and MPEG- 7 activities are targeting standardization to facilitate such services. European COST Telecommunications activities provide a framework for research collaboration. COST 211 bis and COST 211 ter activities have been instrumental in the definition and development of the ITU-T H. 261 and H. 263 standards for videoconferencing over ISDN and <b>videophony</b> over regular phone lines, respectively. The group has also contributed significantly to the ISO MPEG- 4 activities. At present a significant effort of the COST 211 ter group activities is dedicated toward image and video sequence analysis and segmentation—an important technological aspect for the success of emerging object-based MPEG- 4 and MPEG- 7 multimedia applications. The current work of COST 211 is centered around the test model, called the Analysis Model (AM). The essential feature of the AM is its ability to fuse information from different sources to achieve a high-quality object segmentation. The current information sources are the intermediate results from frame-based (still) color segmentation, motion vector based segmentation, and changedetection-based segmentation. Motion vectors, which form the basis for the motion vector based intermediate segmentation, are estimated from consecutive frames. A recursive shortest spanning tree (RSST) algorithm is used to obtain intermediate color and motion vector based segmentation results. A rule-based region processor fuses the intermediate results; a postprocessor further refines the final segmentation output. The results of the current AM are satisfactory; it is expected that there will be further improvements of the AM within the COST 211 project...|$|E
