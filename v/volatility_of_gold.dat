60|$|I {{have said}} that Deville depends upon intense heat for {{carrying}} off vapour; and this {{brings me to the}} point of shewing how vapours are carried off. Here is a basin of mercury, which boils easily, as you know, and gives us the opportunity of observing the facts and principles which are to guide us. I have here two poles of the battery, and if I bring them into contact with the mercury, see what a development of vapour we have. The mercury is flying off rapidly; and I might, if I pleased, put all the company around me in a bath of mercury vapour. And so, if we take this piece of lead and treat it in the same way, it will also give off vapour. Observe the fumes that rise from it; and even if it was so far enclosed from the air that you could not form any litharge, you would still have those abundant fumes flying off. I may also take a piece of gold, and shew you the same thing. I have here a piece of gold which I put upon a clean surface of Paris limestone. Applying the heat of the blowpipe to it, you see how the heat drives off the vapour; and if you notice {{at the end of the}} Lecture, you will observe on the stone a purple patch of condensed gold. Thus you see a proof of the volatilisation of gold. It is the same with silver. You will not be startled if I sometimes use one agent and sometimes another to illustrate a particular point. The <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and silver is the same thing, whether it be effected by the voltaic battery or by the blowpipe. [A lump of silver was placed in a charcoal crucible between the poles of a voltaic battery.] Now, look at the fumes of silver, and observe the peculiar and beautiful green colour which they produce. We shall now shew you this same process of boiling the silver, cast on a screen from the electric lamp which you have before you; and while Dr. Tyndall is kindly getting the lamp ready for this purpose, let me tell you that Deville proposes to throw out in this way all these extraneous things that I have spoken of, except two--namely, iridium and rhodium. It so happens, as he says, that iridium and rhodium do make the metal more capable of resisting the attacks of acids than platinum itself. Alloys are compounded up to 25 per cent. of rhodium and iridium, by which the chemical inaction of the platinum is increased, and also its malleability and other physical properties. [The image of the voltaic discharge through vapour of silver was now thrown upon the screen.] What you have now on the screen is an inverted image of what you saw when we heated the silver before. The fine stream that you see around the silver is the discharge of the electric force that takes place, giving you that glorious green light which you see in the ray; and if Dr. Tyndall will open the top of the lamp, you will see the quantity of fumes that will come out of the aperture, shewing you at once the volatility of silver.|$|E

40|$|We use a {{relatively}} new approach to endogenously detect the volatility shifts in the returns of four major precious metals (gold, silver, platinum and palladium) from 1999 to 2013. We reveal that the turbulent year of 2008 has no significant effect on <b>volatility</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and silver however causes an upward shift in the <b>volatility</b> levels <b>of</b> palladium and platinum. Using the consistent dynamic conditional correlations, we show that precious metals get strongly correlated {{with each other in}} the last decade which reduces the diversification benefits across them and indicates a convergence to a single asset class. We endogenously detect the shifts in these dynamic correlation levels and reveal uni-directional volatility shift contagions among precious metals. The results show that gold has a uni-directional volatility shift contagion effect on all other precious metals and silver has a similar effect on platinum and palladium. However, the latter two do not matter in terms <b>of</b> <b>volatility</b> shift contagion. Thus, investors that hedge with precious metals should, in particular, monitor the <b>volatility</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and silver. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{identify}} the factors that affect gold prices on the Turkish Gold Exchange. To that end, London Bullion Market Association's gold prices, Brent oil prices, the US dollar, the American Dow Jones Industrial Index, Wholesale Price Index, Istanbul Stock Exchange 100 Index, and monthly average time deposit interest rates were selected as the factors with possible impact on gold prices; and relevant econometric models were constructed. In the model that delivered the best results among all the models estimated by using the Engle-Granger two-step estimation procedure, London Bullion Market Association's gold prices {{were found to be}} the single and most important variable that influences the gold prices on the Istanbul <b>Gold</b> Exchange. Estimation <b>of</b> the <b>gold</b> prices on the Istanbul Gold Exchange in the study was done by using ARCH models. The analysis results revealed that the EGARCH(1, 1) model is the best model.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} a {{well-known}} real option: {{the opening and}} closing of mines. Using a new database that tracks the annual opening and closing decisions of 285 developed North American gold mines in the period 1988 - 1997, we confirm many of the predictions from real options models. As predicted, the empirical results demonstrate that {{the probability that a}} mine is open is related to market-wide factors (including the level and <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gold</b> price and the interest rate) as well as to mine-specific factors (including the mine's fixed costs, variable costs, and reserves.) These results are both statistically significant and economically material. There is strong evidence of hysteresis, which would result from non-zero opening and closing costs. Together, the data provide strong support for the real options model as a useful model to describe and predict a mine's opening and shutting decisions. In addition, we find that the decision whether to shut a mine is related to firm-specific managerial factors not normally considered within a strict real options model, most notably the profitability of other mines in the firm's portfolio and of the firm's other businesses. These relationships {{do not seem to be}} based on geographic synergies and we suspect they are an indication of capital allocation processes within these firms...|$|R

40|$|The {{volatility}} of equity returns generally exhibits an asymmetric reaction to {{positive and negative}} shocks. Economic explanations for this phenomenon are leverage and volatility feedback effects. This paper studies the <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and demonstrates {{that there is an}} inverted asymmetric reaction of gold to positive and negative shocks, i. e. positive shocks increase the volatility by more than negative shocks. The paper argues that this effect {{is a result of the}} safe haven property of gold. Macroeconomic and financial uncertainty is transmitted from the equity market to the gold market causing the special asymmetric reaction. The empirical results hold for gold bullion and gold coins denominated in different currencies, different time periods and for different distributional assumptions. Finally, we show that the inverted volatility effect of gold can lower the aggregate risk of a portfolio for specific correlation levels...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:The aim of {{this paper}} is to study through a model rarely used and little known, the effect of the gold price’s {{volatility}} on the south african real exchange rate. More precisely, it is to show that, through the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) GARCH model; we get results that are consistent with economic works (Frankel, 2007) on the relationship between gold price’s volatility and the real exchange rate. The period retained in this research paper going from May 1995 to April 2014 and the frequency of the data is monthly. After analysis, we find that in the short term, the real exchange rate is more sensitive to its own volatility, compared to the effect of the <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> price. This last effect, although high, is less persistent on the real exchange rate. Keywords: Volatility, Exchange rate, Gold price, DCC-GARCH. JEL. C 50, F 30, F 40...|$|E

In this paper, we have taken 30 historical events ranging from the suspension of dollar’s convertibility into gold in August 1971 to the end of the Quantitative Easing in the US in October 2014 and studied their impact on real gold prices. We find that the US economy and the current dollar-based monetary system is still the main driver of real gold prices. Our empirical exercise in this paper finds that the mean and variance of real gold prices have experienced significant changes primarily when the historical events in question either reinforced or challenged the economic dominance of the US and the role of dollar in the global monetary system.

40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the dynamic link between returns and <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> {{commodities}} and currency markets. Based on weekly data over the period from January 6, 1987 to July 22, 2014, we find the following empirical regularities. First, our {{results suggest that the}} information contents <b>of</b> <b>gold,</b> silver, platinum, and the CHF/USD and GBP/USD exchange rates can help improve forecast accuracy <b>of</b> returns and <b>volatilities</b> <b>of</b> palladium, crude oil and the EUR/CHF and GBP/USD exchange rates. Second, gold (CHF/USD) is the dominant commodity (currency) transmitter <b>of</b> return and <b>volatility</b> spillovers to the remaining assets in our model. Third, the analysis of dynamic spillovers shows time{ and event{specific patterns. For instance, the dynamic spillover effects originating in gold and silver (platinum) returns and volatility intensified (degraded) in the period marked by the global financial crisis. After the global financial crisis, the net transmitting role <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and silver (platinum) returns shocks weakened (strengthened), while the net transmitting role <b>of</b> <b>gold,</b> silver and platinum volatility shocks remained relatively high. Overall, our findings reveal that, while the static analysis clearly classifies the aforementioned variables into net transmitters and net receivers, the dynamic analysis denotes episodes wherein the role of transmitters and receivers <b>of</b> return (<b>volatility)</b> spillovers can be interrupted or even reversed. Hence, even if certain commonalities prevail in each identified category of commodities, such commonalities are time - and event - dependent. (authors' abstract...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the various}} {{precious}} metals “Gold” {{is the most}} popular as an investment. Why it is so? The answer is it is a mainstream asset as it is not only an effective diversifier but also gives a competitive return when compared to major financial assets.

The risk and return analysis of an asset class is better studied with its volatility measurement. The present study uses daily prices of gold, stock Nifty 5 o, and India Government Bond.

40|$|AbstractThe study {{analyses}} {{the family}} of regime switching GARCH neural network models, which allow the generalization of MS type RS-GARCH models to MS-GARCH-NN models by incorporating with neural network architectures. Proposed models differ {{in terms of both}} the dynamics of the conditional volatility process and the forecasting capabilities compared to a family of GARCH models. Gray (1996) RS-GARCH model allows regime dependent heteroscedasticity structure following the markov switching methodology of Hamilton (1989). The MS-GARCH-NN model family differ in the sense that, they allow regime switching between GARCH-NN processes. Single regime GARCH-NN models are developed by Donaldson and Kamstra (1996) and further extended by Bildirici and Ersin (2009). Further, the proposed models incorporate a variety of neural network architectures. MS-GARCH-MLP and MS-GARCH-Hybrid-MLP models by Bildirici and Ersin(2014) are augmented with fractional integration (FI) and asymmetric power GARCH variants. And they developed models are MS-FIGARCH-Hybrid-MLP, MS-APGARCH-Hybrid-MLP and MS-FIAPGARCH-Hybrid-MLP models. In this paper, these models were used to test <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> return.
