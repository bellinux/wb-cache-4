Borehole instability can result from erosion, swelling and dispersion of formation clays. It will cause many problems such as stuck pipe, high torque and drag, bridging and hole enlargement. In general, the well bore stability {{can be achieved by}} using oil-based drilling fluids. However, due to the environmental reasons, a need for a better understanding of drilling fluids and shale interaction are very important to formulate an environmental friendly drilling fluid. This study focused on the effects of selected <b>viscosifiers</b> and its concentrations on Terengganu K-shale hydration. The characteristics of K-shale was identified using methylene blue test (MBT). The effects of several <b>viscosifiers</b> such as xanthan gum, PAC-R, polyplus-dry and hydroxyl ethyl cellulose (HEC) on shale hydration were studied using hot-rolling dispersion test. The results showed that <b>viscosifiers</b> can be used to prevent shale hydration. Besides, an increase of <b>viscosifiers</b> concentration can reduce shale hydration and dispersion. The results also showed that xanthan gum and polyplus-dry are more efficient to prevent the shale hydration in comparison with the other two <b>viscosifiers.</b> The study also revealed that xanthan gum gives an optimum rheological properties of KCl-polymer system. ...|$|R

In addition, the mud system’s behaviour at 150  °F was considered and a reduction in the flow properties were recorded at this increased temperature (Fig.  3). This observation was also recorded by Zhao et al. 2008, Makinde et al. (2011) and Amani and Al-Jubouri (2012) for different <b>viscosifiers</b> used in their studies.

40|$|CO 2 {{has been}} widely used as a {{displacement}} fluid in both immiscible and miscible displacement processes to obtain tertiary recovery from the field. There are several {{problems associated with the}} application of CO 2 flooding, especially when there is a significant presence of heterogeneous elements, such as fractures, channels and high permeability streaks within the reservoir. With flooding, CO 2 will finger through the target zone while leaving most of the residual/trapped oil untouched. As a result, early gas breakthrough has been a very common problem in CO 2 -related projects, reducing the overall sweep efficiency of CO 2 flooding. This research aims at improving the CO 2 flood efficiency using cross-linked gel conformance control and CO 2 <b>viscosifier</b> technique. A series of coreflood experiment studies have been performed to investigate the possibility of applying CO 2 mobility control techniques. Corresponding simulation works have also been carried out to predict the benefits of applying CO 2 mobility control techniques in the field. In the laboratory study, the CO 2 coreflood system was integrated with the CT (Computed Tomography) -scanner and obtained real-time coreflood images of the CO 2 saturation distributions in the core. This system was applied to the research of both cross-linked polymer gel treatment and CO 2 <b>viscosifier</b> study and produced images with sharp phase contrasts. For the gel conformance study, promising results were obtained by applying cross-linked gel to eliminate permeability contrast and diverting CO 2 into low permeability regions to obtain incremental oil recovery; also studied were the gel strength in terms of leak-off extent with the aid of CT (Computed Tomography) images. For the CO 2 <b>viscosifier</b> research, we tested several potential <b>viscosifier</b> chemicals and found out PVAc (Polyvinylacetate) /toluene combination to be the most promising. The follow-up study clearly demonstrates the superiority of viscosified CO 2 over neat CO 2 in terms of sweep efficiency.

We consider the structure, properties, extraction, production, modification, and applications of a selected range of polysaccharides. Xanthan (Xanthomonas campestris) and xylinan (Acetobacter xylinum) have a β(1 → 4) -linked glucan main chain with alternating residues substituted on the 3 -position with a trisaccharide (xanthan) or pentasaccharide (xylinan) and are used commercially as <b>viscosifiers.</b> Gellan (Pseudomonas elodea) and curdlan (Alcaligenes faecalis) are xanthan-like polysaccharides although their application as a thickening agent is limited to Japan. Exopolysaccharides from Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) {{have been reported to}} have potential applications as emulsifiers, <b>viscosifiers,</b> and bioflocculants. Pullulan (Aureobasidium pullulans) and dextran (Leuconostoc mesenteroides) are α(1 → 6) d-glucopyranosyl polymers with (1 → 2), (1 → 3), or (1 → 4) branches. Both the polymers are used as gel filtration calibration materials. Bacteria can also produce alginate and hyaluronic acid (HA) for use in applications such as viscosurgery and viscosupplementation. Two structurally similar fungal polysaccharides scleroglucan and schizophyllan used in cosmetics and pesticides are also discussed.

Severe formation damage {{can be caused}} by most polymers. Moreover, thermal stability limits the applications of biopolymer-based fluids at high temperatures. Here, four nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) have been evaluated as <b>viscosifiers</b> to prepare aqueous fluids, and compared to guar-based fluids. The rheological properties and solid suspending ability of NFC-based fluids have been studied with the effects of temperature and salts. Formation damage of the new type of fluids in different formations has been evaluated. Degradation studies have been performed using different types of breakers. The viscosity measurements have shown that the NFC-based fluids were stable as high as 350 ?F. For non-charged NFC, the fluids had a high tolerance to KCl and CaCl 2. Moreover, NFC-based fluids had a good solid suspending ability, which out-performanced guar-based fluids. Coreflood tests were run using cores of different permeability. As for NFC-based fluids, the regained permeabilities were 85 % or higher of the initial permeabilities in low-permeability cores, suggesting that NFC caused a slight damage. However, guar and HPG fluids caused much more damage than NFC fluids under same conditions. Severe damage was caused to high-permeability cores (about 400 md or more) when treated by NFC-based fluids. The damage degree was related to the size of NFC fibers. Fibers of smaller sizes can invade the core and plug the pore throats more easily. However, the new fluids were successfully degraded by different breakers, indicated by the significant decrease in the fluid viscosity. HPLC analyses have shown that the new <b>viscosifiers</b> can be mostly degraded into soluble products with low viscosity, which can be flowed back after the treatment. This work has evaluated four nanofibrillated cellulose fibers as <b>viscosifiers</b> in fluids. These new fluids have better thermal stability and solid suspending ability than guar-based fluids under the same conditions. High regained permeability of low-permeability cores can be maintained when treated by the new fluids. Severe damage was caused in high-permeability cores, however, the damage can be removed because the fluids were degraded successfully...|$|R

The polymeric nanocomposites showed also superior advantages for oil drilling relevances, automotive lubricating purposes, membrane technology and food packaging. Scanning electron microscopy images indicated a homogeneous dispersion of the nanofiller within the polymeric matrix at low filler loadings and a cluster formation at higher loadings that could {{be responsible for the}} polymeric matrix movement restrictions. The enthalpy of mixing (the polymer and the nanofiller) measured could explain the cause of the repulsive interactions between the nanoparticles and the polymeric chains, which created an additional excluded volume that the polymeric segments were restricted to occupy, thus forcing the conformational characteristics of the polymeric chains to deviate away from those of the bulk chains.

For the shale gas application, we have already alluded to the undesirable chemical <b>viscosifiers</b> and breakers added to modify viscosity. Recent work on viscoelastic surfactants (Dogon and Golombok 2016 a, b), has demonstrated that viscosity modifications can be tuned to arise from the flow conditions associated with the different stages of the process i.e., they display flow-induced viscoelasticity whereby the viscosity adjusts according to the flow conditions. For oil recovery this means that they automatically show high fluid viscous resistance in high permeability regions (Santvoort and Golombok 2018). For the fracking problem it means that they have initially high viscosity for proppant carrying purposes but afterwards during “flowback”, the viscosity falls to near water levels enabling return flow through the proppant pack without dislodging particles.
