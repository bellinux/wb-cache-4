In addition, simulation experiments suggested that in both polymerizations the rate of deactivation is similar. In SET-LRP, the Cu(II) X- 2 /L deactivator is created by the disproportionation of Cu(I) X/L inactive species, while in ATRP its concentration is mediated by the bimolecular termination.

Similarly, treatment of 3 with Au(SMe 2) Cl afforded 4, ostensibly <b>via</b> a <b>disproportionation</b> process. The cytotoxicities of complexes 2, 3, and 4 were examined against HepG 2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), HCT 116 (human colorectal carcinoma), A 549 (human lung adenocarcinoma), and MCF- 7 (human breast adenocarcinoma) cells. Au(I) -NHC complex 3 exhibited a cytotoxicity that {{was similar to that}} of cisplatin towards all the four cancer cell lines tested; by comparison, Ag(I) NHC complex 2 and Au(III) NHC complex 4 appeared relatively less potent. Complex 3 was found to induce apoptosis in HepG 2 cells. close 0...|$|R
