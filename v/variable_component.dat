5|$|As at 31 December 2010, the {{remuneration}} of ministers depended on which ministerial grade – from the lowest to the highest, MR4, MR3, MR2 or MR1 – they were at. Each minister's pay package {{was made up}} of fixed components (a monthly salary for 12 months, a non-pensionable annual allowance of one month's salary, a special allowance of one month's salary, and a public service leadership allowance of two months' salary) and variable components (an annual <b>variable</b> <b>component,</b> a performance bonus, and a gross domestic product (GDP) bonus). The annual <b>variable</b> <b>component</b> of up to one and a half month's salary was paid based on Singapore's economic performance. In years where economic performance was exceptional, a special variable payment was also made. Each minister's performance bonus was determined by the Prime Minister and could be up to 14 months' salary, though most good performers received the equivalent of nine months' salary. The GDP bonus depended on the nation's GDP growth rate. No bonus was paid if the rate was below 2%, and a maximum bonus of eight months' salary was paid if the rate was 10% or greater. In addition, ministers received the same medical benefits as civil servants. In 2010, the benchmark annual remuneration for an MR4-grade minister was $2,598,004, while the actual salary paid was $1,583,900. An MR1-grade minister's salary was $2,368,500. The annual pay of the Prime Minister was set at a fixed ratio to the MR4 salary, and was $3,072,200 in 2010. This included a fixed service bonus in lieu of a performance bonus since {{there was no one to}} assess the Prime Minister's individual performance. The fixed service bonus was the same as the performance bonus paid to a good performer at the MR4 grade.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 2012, the Public Service Division of the Prime Minister's Office {{announced}} that the fixed component of the salary of a political appointment holder would be 13 months {{of his or her}} monthly salary. For 2011, the annual <b>variable</b> <b>component</b> of the salary would be 1.25 months plus $250, while the national bonus would be 2.625 months though appointment holders would receive a pro rata amount of 1.618 months' pay as the new salaries took effect from 21 May 2011 when the Cabinet was appointed following the general election. The targets for the four indicators making up the national bonus were 2–3% for real median income growth of citizens and real median income growth for the lowest 20th percentile of citizens, 3–5% for real GDP growth, and not more than 4.5% for the unemployment rate of citizens. Each appointment holder's performance bonus would be determined by the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} naked-eye double stars in Grus. Forming a {{triangle}} with Alnair and Beta, Delta Gruis is an optical double whose components—Delta1 and Delta2—are separated by 45 arcseconds. Delta1 is a yellow giant of spectral type G7III and magnitude 4.0, 309 light-years from Earth, {{and may have}} its own magnitude 12 orange dwarf companion. Delta2 is a red giant of spectral type M4.5III and semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 3.99 and 4.2, located 325 light-years from Earth. It has around 3 times the mass and 135 times the diameter of our sun. Mu Gruis, composed of Mu1 and Mu2, is also an optical double—both stars are yellow giants of spectral type G8III around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun with surface temperatures of around 4900 K. Mu1 is the brighter of the two at magnitude 4.8 located around 275 light-years from Earth, while Mu2 the dimmer at magnitude 5.11 lies 265 light-years distant from Earth. Pi Gruis, an optical double with a <b>variable</b> <b>component,</b> is composed of Pi1 Gruis and Pi2. Pi1 is a semi-regular red giant of spectral type S5, ranging from magnitude 5.31 to 7.01 {{over a period of}} 191 days, and is around 532 light-years from Earth. One of the brightest S-class stars to Earth viewers, it has a companion star of apparent magnitude 10.9 with sunlike properties, being a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G0V. The pair make up a likely binary system. Pi2 is a giant star of spectral type F3III-IV located around 130 light-years from Earth, and is often brighter than its companion at magnitude 5.6. Marking the right wing is Theta Gruis, yet another double star, lying 5 degrees east of Delta1 and Delta2.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{presents}} a quantification method {{for the potential}} benefits of applying geometrically <b>variable</b> <b>components</b> to an UCAV aero engine concept. The method includes thermodynamic modeling techniques for a set of geometrically <b>variable</b> <b>components</b> as well as an optimization strategy to find the optimal schedule of the geometry variations in dependence of flight condition, figure of merit and engine constraints. First, a conventional generic two-spool mixed-flow turbofan engine comprising state-of-the-art component technology is designed as a baseline configuration. Then this cycle is used to study the influence of individual geometrically <b>variable</b> <b>components</b> on the thermodynamic cycle and finally to quantify the performance gain at selected off-design conditions. This examination serves as a preliminary study for the design of an optimal variable cycle engine (VCE). It does not investigate the optimal design of <b>variable</b> <b>components</b> for a specific task. An optimization process chain based on the commercial software framework ModelCenter™ is developed and applied to find the optimal settings of the geometrically <b>variable</b> <b>components</b> for different figures of merit at certain flight conditions. Finally, the baseline configuration without <b>variable</b> <b>components</b> is compared to the variable cycle configuration and the benefits of the geometrically <b>variable</b> <b>components</b> are assessed for a generic UCAV mission. ...|$|R
