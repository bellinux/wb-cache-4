5000|$|Eugene Richard of the Buick Manufacturing Company {{was awarded}} US Patent #771,095 in 1904 for the <b>valve</b> <b>in</b> <b>head</b> engine. It {{included}} rocker arms and push rods, a water jacket {{for the head}} which communicated with {{the one in the}} cylinder block, and lifters pushed by a camshaft with a 2-to-1 gearing ratio to the crankshaft. Arthur Chevrolet was awarded US Patent #1,744,526 for an adapter that could be applied to an existing engine, thus transforming it into an Overhead Valve Engine.The Wright Brothers built their own airplane engines, and starting in 1906, they used overhead valves, push rods, and rocker arms, for the exhaust valves only, the intake valves being [...] "automatic suction" [...] valves. They even built a V-8 engine with this valve configuration in 1910. In 1949, Oldsmobile introduced the Rocket V8, the first V-8 engine with OHV's to be produced on a wide scale.|$|E
5000|$|Reeves {{continued}} to work on developing a car and by 1904 had convinced his brothers to back another attempt. He made four Model D and six Model E cars by 1905. The D had a 12 hp engine and the E an 18-20 hp engine. In 1905 he produced an air cooled, <b>valve</b> <b>in</b> <b>head</b> motor with individually cast cylinders, splash lubrication, and intake and exhaust manifolds on opposite sides. That year Reeves obtained a contract for 500 of these engines from the Aerocar Company and by 1906 was making 15 engines a week. 1906 saw {{the introduction of a}} water cooled model and the Model J engined car the Reeves Go-Buggy. The Model P engine was used in the Sears Motor Buggy. The engines {{continued to}} evolve until 1910 when the family again abandoned the idea because of the collapse of the Aerocar Company. [...] Through this period Reeves had continued to make cars with the Model S and N being two of the types. The variable speed transmission continued to be made by the Reeves Pulley Company up until 1955 when it was acquired by the Reliance Electric Company, now part of the Baldor Electric Company.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} reciprocating expander {{was designed}} with features appropriate for cryocooler cycles. The expander has a displacer piston, simple valves, and a hydraulic/pneumatic stroking mechanism. The expander has a <b>valve</b> <b>in</b> <b>head</b> configuration with the valves extending out {{the bottom of}} the vacuum enclosure while the piston extends out the top. The expander was tested using a CTI 1400 liquefier to supply 13 atm in the temperature range 4. 2 to 12 K. Expander efficiency was measured in the range 84 to 93 % while operating the apparatus as a supercritical wet expander and in the range 91 to 93 % aa a single phase expander. The apparatus can also be modified to operate as a compressor for saturated helium vapor...|$|E
5000|$|For a {{cylindrical}} bore and equal-area sized valves, {{increasing the}} number of valves beyond five decreases the total valve area. The following table shows the effective areas of differing valve quantities as proportion of cylinder bore. These percentages are based on simple geometry and do not take into account orifices for spark plugs or injectors, but these voids will usually be sited in the [...] "dead space" [...] unavailable for <b>valves.</b> Also, <b>in</b> practice, intake <b>valves</b> are often larger than exhaust <b>valves</b> <b>in</b> <b>heads</b> with an even number of valves-per-cylinder.|$|R
50|$|In 1936 and 1937, the Indian Four had {{the valve}} {{positions}} reversed, with the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>in</b> the <b>head</b> and the inlet <b>valve</b> <b>in</b> the block. In theory, this would improve fuel vaporization, {{and the engine}} was actually more powerful. However, the new system made the cylinder head very hot. The exhaust valve linkage required frequent adjustment. The design was returned to the original IOE configuration in 1938.|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis covers engine braking systems of trucks and tractors. The thesis describes several vehicle retardation systems {{as well as}} their construction and function of individual parts as they function under various operating conditions and in specific situations. I will discuss in detail the systems used by Scania, employing a hydrodynamic retarder; Mercedes-Benz, activating the fifth <b>valve</b> <b>in</b> a cylinder <b>head</b> and Volvo and Mercedes-Benz, operating the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>in</b> a cylinder <b>head.</b> I will also explain the function of an exhaust manifold flap valve employed by the above manufacturers in combination with their systems...|$|R

50|$|Some engines {{have been}} made with the reverse configuration, having the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>in</b> the {{cylinder}} <b>head</b> and the intake <b>valve</b> <b>in</b> the block. The ABC Skootamota began production with an engine of this configuration, but this was changed to an overhead valve engine before production ended.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a Thornycroft GB6 11.3 litre straight-six petrol engine. As was common for the period, the {{cylinders}} were cast in two blocks of three. Valves used the [...] "IOE" [...] or [...] "Inlet over Exhaust" [...] arrangement, with overhead <b>valves</b> (<b>in</b> the <b>head)</b> for the inlets and side-valves (in the cylinder block) for the exhaust. Dry sump lubrication was used, to avoid problems when tilted off-road. To reduce weight, many cast components were in aluminium, rather than iron.|$|R
50|$|This {{was a more}} {{expensive}} engine design. Its advantages over competing L-head engines included more power from its higher compression, better intake mixture flow, less susceptibility to pinging, and greater reliability from its cooling of the exhaust valve and its spring (and having half the number of pushrods of an OHV engine). With only one <b>valve</b> <b>in</b> the <b>head,</b> and one <b>in</b> the block, larger valves can be used than in an OHV engine, to offset the poorer airflow of a side exhaust valve.|$|R
50|$|It {{was quite}} {{advanced}} in some ways, using hydraulic disc brakes {{both at the}} front and back as well as a 6 <b>valve</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> other ways, however, it was harking back to the late '70s with its retro styling, semi automatic camchain tensioner and balancer system.|$|R

50|$|The {{overhead}} valve {{internal combustion engine}} was known by at least 1896 when U.S. patent 563,140, awarded to William F. Davis, illustrated an internal combustion engine with <b>valves</b> <b>in</b> the <b>head.</b> The concept of push rods and rocker arms was being widely used in steam engines before then. In 1898, Detroit bicycle manufacturer Walter Lorenzo Marr built a motor-trike with a one-cylinder OHV engine with a bore and stroke of 3 inches each. In 1900, David Buick hired Marr as chief engineer at the Buick Auto-Vim and Power Company in Detroit, where he worked until 1902. Marr's engine employed pushrod-actuated rocker arms, which <b>in</b> turn pushed <b>valves</b> parallel to the pistons, and this is still in use today. This contrasts with previous designs which made use of side valves and sleeve valves. Marr left Buick briefly {{to start his own}} automobile company in 1902, the Marr Auto-Car, and made a handful of cars with {{overhead valve}} engines, before coming back to Buick in 1904. The OHV engine was patented in 1902 (awarded 1904) by Buick's second chief engineer Eugene Richard, at the Buick Manufacturing Company, precursor to the Buick Motor Company. The world's first production overhead valve internal combustion engine was put into the first production Buick automobile, the 1904 Model B, which used a 2-cylinder Flat twin engine, with 2 <b>valves</b> <b>in</b> each <b>head.</b> The engine was designed by Marr and David Buick.|$|R
5000|$|In 1913 the Seguin {{brothers}} {{introduced the}} new Monosoupape ("single valve") series, which replaced inlet <b>valves</b> <b>in</b> the pistons {{by using a}} single <b>valve</b> <b>in</b> each cylinder <b>head,</b> which doubled as inlet and exhaust valve. The engine speed was controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using levers acting on the valve tappet rollers, a system later abandoned due to valves burning. The weight of the Monosoupape was slightly less than the earlier two-valve engines, and it used less lubricating oil. The 100 hp Monosoupape was built with 9 cylinders, and developed its rated power at 1,200 rpm. [...] The later 160 hp nine-cylinder Gnome 9N rotary engine used the Monosoupape valve design, and was the last known rotary engine design to use such a cylinder head valving format.Rotary engines produced by the Clerget and Le Rhône companies used conventional pushrod-operated <b>valves</b> <b>in</b> the cylinder <b>head,</b> but used the same principle of drawing the fuel mixture through the crankshaft, with the Le Rhônes having prominent copper intake tubes running from the crankcase {{to the top of}} each cylinder to admit the intake charge.|$|R
50|$|KIVA-3V is {{the most}} mature version of KIVA still {{maintained}} and distributed through LANL; it is an improved version of the earlier Federal Laboratory Consortium Excellence in Technology Transfer Award-winning KIVA3 (1993), extended to model vertical or canted <b>valves</b> <b>in</b> the cylinder <b>head</b> of a gasoline or diesel engine. KIVA3, in turn, {{was based on the}} earlier KIVA2 (1989) and used the same numerical solution procedure and solved the same types of equations.|$|R
50|$|At a given engine speed, {{a longer}} stroke {{increases}} engine friction (since the piston travels a greater distance per stroke) and increases {{stress on the}} crankshaft due to the higher peak piston acceleration. The smaller bore also reduces the area available for <b>valves</b> <b>in</b> the cylinder <b>head,</b> requiring them to be smaller or fewer in number. Because these factors favor lower engine speeds, undersquare engines are most often tuned to develop peak torque at relatively low speeds.|$|R
50|$|A vacuum engine (also called flame-licker engine, flame-engine, flame-dancer) derives {{its force}} from air {{pressure}} against {{one side of}} the piston, which has a partial vacuum {{on the other side of}} it. At the beginning of an outstroke, a <b>valve</b> <b>in</b> the <b>head</b> of the cylinder opens and admits a charge of burning gas and air, which is trapped by the closing of the valve and expands. Towards the end of the stroke the charge comes into contact with a water- or air-cooled part of the cylinder and is chilled, causing a sudden drop in pressure sufficient to suck the piston - which is open towards the crank - back on the return stroke. The <b>valve</b> opens again <b>in</b> time for the piston to expel the burnt gases before the next outstroke begins.|$|R
5000|$|An {{oversquare}} engine allows {{for more and}} larger <b>valves</b> <b>in</b> the <b>head</b> of the cylinder, higher possible RPM by lowering maximum piston ring speed and lower crank stress due to the lower peak piston acceleration for the same engine speed. Due to the increased piston and head surface area, the heat loss increases as the bore/stroke ratio is increased. Thus an excessively high ratio {{can lead to a}} decreased thermal efficiency compared to other engine geometries. Because these characteristics favor higher engine speeds, {{oversquare engine}}s are often tuned to develop peak torque at a relatively high speed. The large size/width of the combustion chamber at ignition can cause increased inhomogeneity in the air/fuel mixture during combustion, resulting in higher emissions.|$|R

Blocks may, therefore, be easily repaired, if required, using conventional shop tools. Each bank of cylinders has an overhead camshaft which operates the exhaust valves and the unit injectors.|$|R
50|$|All Series 71 engines use uniflow scavenging, where a gear-driven Roots type blower {{mounted to}} the {{exterior}} of the engine provides intake air through cored passages in the engine block and ports in the cylinder walls at slightly greater than atmospheric pressure. The engine exhausts through pushrod-operated poppet <b>valves</b> <b>in</b> the cylinder <b>head(s),</b> with either two or four valves per cylinder. Unit injection is employed, one injector per cylinder, with no high fuel pressure outside of the injector body.

5000|$|The TTC-V was a {{licensed}} copy of Honda's CVCC system, and {{was first introduced}} in February 1975. It was only available in the Carina and Corona lines, and only on the 19R engine, a modified 18R. From March 1976 the TTC-V system was upgraded to meet the stricter yet 1976 emissions standards. The TTC-V engine was discontinued in 1977.

5000|$|The WAM unit is a {{direct-drive}} two-stroke inverted inline triple with wet-sump, liquid cooling, supercharger, turbocharger and intercooler. Compression boost at startup comes via a supercharger, {{but once}} the engine is running, a turbocharger provides additional boost. [...] Being inverted, the engine has its crankshaft at the top directly driving the propeller, and a camshaft at the bottom, immersed in sump oil. Charged air for combustion is introduced under pressure through a gallery of small ports, and exhaust gases are later expelled through poppet <b>valves</b> <b>in</b> the cylinder <b>head.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The L46 {{became an}} {{optional}} engine for the 1969 Chevrolet Corvette. It was a higher performance {{version of the}} base 350 cu in V8 with casting number 186 2.02 in/1.60 <b>in</b> <b>valve</b> <b>heads</b> and had an 11:1 compression ratio (high octane gas must be used) and produced [...] It was also available in 1970. 4bbl Quadrajet carburetor and L46 hydraulic cam, dome piston (+), 186 heads, and a four-bolt block.|$|R
50|$|At the time, unique {{features}} of the BMW OHV V8 included the aluminium construction of the block and head, and a coolant passage design that increased the block stiffness over typical engines with wet cylinder liners. The layout of the engine is a longitudinally-mounted 90° V8 with cast iron wet liners and stiffening webs between the cylinders. Apart from the materials, the engine was similar in overall design to the Cadillac OHV V8 and Oldsmobile V8 engine of the late 1940s, with a central camshaft using pushrods to operating overhead <b>valves</b> <b>in</b> crossflow cylinder <b>heads</b> with wedge-shaped combustion chambers.|$|R
50|$|In a {{piston engine}} {{configuration}} where the valves are overhead but the camshaft is not, informally called pushrod engine or I-head engine, the camshaft is placed within the cylinder block (usually beside and slightly above the crankshaft {{in a straight}} engine or directly above the crankshaft in the V of a V engine), and uses pushrods or rods to actuate rocker arms above the cylinder head to actuate the valves. Lifters or tappets {{are located in the}} engine block between the camshaft and pushrods. By contrast, overhead camshaft design avoids the use of pushrods by putting the camshaft directly above the <b>valves</b> <b>in</b> the cylinder <b>head,</b> thus simplifying the valvetrain.|$|R
50|$|In most {{types of}} {{reciprocating}} engines, a valve guide is provided for each poppet <b>valve</b> <b>in</b> the cylinder <b>head.</b> Along with the valve spring, it serves to positively locate the valve {{so that it}} may make proper contact with the valve seat. A valve guide is a cylindrical piece of metal, pressed or integrally cast into the cylinder head, with the valve reciprocating inside it. Guides also serve to conduct heat from the combustion process out from the exhaust valve and into the cylinder head where it may be {{taken up by the}} cooling system. Bronze is commonly used, as is steel; a balance between stiffness and wear on the valve is essential to achieve a useful service life.|$|R

50|$|The Trofimoff valve {{comprises}} the valve spindle, the piston valve heads slotted onto {{them and the}} two supporting plates (Stützplatten). When the engine is running under load the valve heads are forced by steam pressure onto the support plates and work like standard pistons (Regelkolbenschieber). If steam admission ceases or, on a steam locomotive, the regulator is closed, the pressure drops, the <b>valve</b> <b>heads</b> remain <b>in</b> the inside dead centre position near {{the centre of the}} cylinder due to the tension of the piston rings. The valve spindle continues to move backwards and forwards with the support plates attached to it, without disturbing the <b>valve</b> <b>heads.</b> <b>In</b> this way, perfect pressure balance is achieved, thus ensuring excellent light-running conditions for the steam engine or locomotive.|$|R
5000|$|All 710 {{engines are}} {{two-stroke}} 45 degree V-engines. The 710, and the earlier 645 and 567, {{are the only}} two-stroke engines commonly used today in locomotives. The 710 model was introduced in 1985 and has a 1 in longer stroke (now 11 in) than the 645 (10 in stroke). The engine is a uniflow design with four poppet-type exhaust <b>valves</b> <b>in</b> the cylinder <b>head.</b> For maintenance, a power assembly, consisting of a cylinder head, cylinder liner, piston, piston carrier, and piston rod can be individually and relatively easily and quickly replaced. The block is made from flat, formed, and rolled structural steel members and steel forgings welded into a single structure (a [...] "weldment"). Blocks may, therefore, be easily repaired, if required, using conventional shop tools. Each bank of cylinders has a camshaft which operates the exhaust valves and the Unit injectors.|$|R
50|$|Over time, {{the inner}} {{diameter}} of the valve guide and the outer {{diameter of the}} valve stem may become worn. In the 1980s, many U.S. production engine remanufacturers began reaming valve guides, rather than replacing them, {{as part of their}} remanufacturing process. They found that by reaming all the <b>valve</b> guides <b>in</b> a <b>head</b> to one standard size (typically 0.008 in. diametrically oversized), and installing remanufactured engine valves having stems that are also oversized, a typical engine head can be remanufactured in much less time. Since the reaming process leaves the valve guide with a much better surface finish and shape than typical replacement guides, and since the oversize valves often have chrome plated stems, remanufacturers also discovered that valve train warranty issues are virtually eliminated.|$|R
50|$|In {{very early}} engine designs the valves were 'upside down' in the block, {{parallel}} to the cylinders. This was the so-called L-head engine design, because of {{the shape of the}} cylinder and combustion chamber, also called 'flathead engine' as the top of the cylinder head was flat. The term preferred outside America (though occasionally used there too) was sidevalve; hence, its use {{in the name of the}} UK-based Ford Sidevalve Owners' Club. Although this design made for simplified and cheap construction, it had two major drawbacks; the tortuous path followed by the intake charge limited air flow and effectively prevented speeds greater than 3600 RPM, and the path of the exhaust through the block could cause overheating under sustained heavy load. This design evolved into 'Intake Over Exhaust', IOE or F-head, where the intake <b>valve</b> was <b>in</b> the <b>head</b> and the exhaust <b>valve</b> was <b>in</b> the block; later both valves moved to the head.|$|R
5000|$|All 645 {{engines are}} {{two-stroke}} 45-degree V-engines. Each cylinder is of 645 cuin L displacement, hence the name; with a bore of 9+1/16 in, {{a stroke of}} 10 in and a compression ratio of 14.5:1. The engine is a uniflow design with four poppet-type exhaust <b>valves</b> <b>in</b> the cylinder <b>head</b> and charge air scavenging ports within {{the sides of the}} cylinders. All engines use a single overhead camshaft per bank, with exhaust valves operated by two cam lobes (each of which operates two exhaust valves through a [...] "bridge") and one cam lobe to operate the Unit injector which is {{in the center of the}} four exhaust valves. Rocker arms are roller-equipped to eliminate friction while hydraulic valve actuators are used to eliminate valve lash. Post-1995 710 engines employ Electronic Unit injectors, however these injectors still utilize a camshaft-actuated piston pump, as on non-EFI injectors.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Municipal {{solid wastes}} {{collected}} in sanitary landfill contain {{a significant percentage}} of organic substances whose degradation produces a large amount of biogas, that, due to the large methane content, is a precious source of energy and has high global warming potential. The biogas can be collected and use in internal combustion engines to produce electrical and thermal energy. In the following, a sanitary landfill located in central Italy has been experimentally investigated, to study the behaviour of biogas captation wells with different positions of the suction valve with an innovative methodology: the infrared (IR) thermography. This is a visual representation of the natural emission due to the reflection of the infrared radiations. The IR thermography can be applied in landfills, because the biogas migrates to the surface at a higher temperature than the surrounding environment heating the soil through which it flows. By measuring the temperature of the soil in the landfill it is possible to detect biogas leakages and migration to the atmosphere. In this paper the area of influence of one well has been analysed in detail, to evaluate the biogas emissions during the opening and closing of suction <b>valve</b> positioned <b>in</b> <b>head</b> of the well. Studying the IR images, it is possible to evaluate the soil heating around the well and to correlate the thermal anomaly with the flow rate through the suction <b>valve.</b> <b>In</b> fact, during the acquisition sequences, it was possible to locate the optimal opening position of the suction valve analysing the soil temperature around the well. In this way the captured biogas has the minimum quantity of external air. The CH 4, O 2 and CO 2 percentage were measured with a gas analyser directly in landfill during the section tests. 1...|$|R
