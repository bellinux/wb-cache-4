40|$|There is a {{long history}} of using <b>videogames</b> in a {{therapeutic}} capacity including rehabilitation for stroke patients, people with traumatic brain injuries, burns victims, wheelchair users, Erb’s palsy sufferers, children undergoing chemotherapy, children with muscular dystrophy, autistic children and individuals looking to overcome real-life challenges (including symptoms of depression) and boost their wellbeing (including boosting life satisfaction, self-efficacy and social support). This paper briefly and selectively examines a number of areas including: (1) <b>videogames</b> as physiotherapy and occupational therapy, (2) <b>videogames</b> as distractors in the role of pain management, (3) <b>videogames</b> and cognitive rehabilitation, (4) <b>videogames</b> and the development of social and communication skills among the learning disabled, (5) <b>videogames</b> and impulsivity/attention deficit disorders, (6) <b>videogames</b> and therapeutic benefits in the elderly, (7) <b>videogames</b> in psychotherapeutic settings, (8) <b>videogames</b> and health care, (9) <b>videogames</b> and anxiety disorders, and (10) <b>videogames</b> and psychological wellbeing. It is concluded that there has been considerable success when games are specifically designed to address a specific problem or to teach a certain skill.

Although there is a burgeoning body of scholarship that deals with <b>videogames</b> in new media and games studies, human geography is only just beginning to offer its own take on the medium and the practices associated with it. This essay outlines ways in which scholars (both within geography and beyond) have traced out the geographies in <b>videogames</b> (in terms of the representations and politics within <b>videogames),</b> the geographies of <b>videogames</b> (in terms of the production and consumption of <b>videogames)</b> and <b>videogames</b> as a cultural geographical practice (in terms of the technocultural practices through which <b>videogames</b> and videogamers are produced).
