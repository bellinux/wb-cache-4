40|$|We discuss {{possibilities}} {{to investigate}} the effects of CP (and T) <b>violation</b> <b>in</b> the lepton sector in neutrino oscillation experiments.

Using the constraints on the mixing parameters that follow {{from the results of}} short-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, we derive rather strong upper bounds on the effects of CP <b>violation</b> <b>in</b> nu_mu nu_e transitions in long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.

5|$|Following {{his return}} to Jableh, al-Qassam {{commenced}} a program of Islamic revival based on moral reforms which included the encouragement of maintaining regular salaah (prayer) and the sawm (fasting) during Ramadan as well as advocating an end to gambling and alcohol consumption. Al-Qassam's campaign highly influenced Jableh's residents who increasingly adopted his reforms. He developed amiable relations with the local Ottoman police who he would call upon to enforce Sharia law on rare cases of major <b>violations.</b> <b>In</b> some occasions, he would send disciples as vigilantes to intercept caravans transporting alcohol which would then be disposed of.
