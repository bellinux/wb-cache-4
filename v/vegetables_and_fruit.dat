40|$|Abstract—Participation {{in global}} trade means that China’s <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> {{industry}} faces international food safety standards and increased scrutiny worldwide. The objectives {{of this paper}} were to investigate how existing food safety standards and regulations in the importing countries impact the export of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> from China. This paper discussed the current and historical situations of China’s <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> export from 1996 to 2010, analyzed the Maximum Residual Limit (MRL) standards of pesticides imposed by importing countries, quantitatively estimated the impacts of food safety standards on China’s <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> export based on a gravity model. The results showed that although transportation distance between trade partners and tariff rates on <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> were still the importantly resistant factors for China export, <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> export was sensitive {{to the number of}} regulated pesticides, the strictness, and the level of food safety standards imposed by importing countries, which showed a significant trade flow effect, stricter food safety standards, increased number of regulated pesticides significantly inhibit China export of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits.</b> Moreover, China’s food safety standards also showed a significantly effect on <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> export, which inhibited export to some extent...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Background and aims: Identifying {{strategies}} to increase children’s <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> intake at a population level {{is a key}} strategy in the World Health Organization's Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health. Schools are recommended settings in which population-wide <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> interventions can be delivered. This thesis aimed to: 1. Review, systematic review evidence regarding the effectiveness of school-based <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in increasing children’s consumption of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruit.; 2. Describe school Principals’ attitudes and reported barriers {{to the implementation of}} <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in Australia; the prevalence of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in Australian schools; and the school characteristics and implementation strategies associated with school <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs.; 3. Assess the effectiveness of a multi-strategy intervention in increasing the implementation of a <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> program by a population of primary schools.; 4. Describe schools’ implementation of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs <b>and</b> other healthy eating and physical activity practices across an eight-year period, and to determine if their implementation varies according to the size, geographic or socio-economic location of schools.; 5. Provide recommendations for future research and practice regarding increasing the implementation of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in primary schools. Results: A synthesis of systematic reviews found that school-based <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs could have a modest impact on children’s combined <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> intake by approximately + 0. 25 serves per day. A cross-sectional survey of New South Wales school Principals found that only 40 % of schools in 2008 were implementing a <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> program to the recommended level. The thesis then demonstrated in a quasi-experimental study involving 828 schools that a multi-strategy intervention can significantly increase the implementation of a <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> program to the recommended level (intervention vs comparison (OR 2. 36; 95 % CI 1. 60 - 3. 49, p< 0. 001). Finally, using a longitudinal cohort study with 476 New South Wales schools, the thesis found that, over an eight-year period, the implementation of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs by schools increased, as did other healthy eating practices whilst some physical activity practices did not significantly improve. Conclusion: The thesis provides new evidence and methods on how to implement <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in a population of schools. Furthermore it demonstrates a need and opportunity for public health policy makers and practitioners to adopt such {{strategies to}} enhance the implementation of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in primary schools...|$|R

This situation has affected vendors of the products since they cannot generate high income to suffice their livelihood. There are a number of factors that contribute for low intake of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> among Chamazi residents including; lack of nutrition education on the importance of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits,</b> low income that affects purchasing power and unavailability of different varieties of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> in Chamazi market. Consequently a number of factors that contribute to low sales among vendors are such as lack of entrepreneurial skills, poor marketing skill, poor working environment (market space) l lack of capital, unreliable market for some varieties which are not common in Chamazi market and poor technology i. e. lacks of preservative facilities (cold rooms) since <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> are more perishable products. However, <b>Vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> selling is a very good and reliable business if it is done with expertise following the potential nutrients found for human health. Every individual and household requires to consume <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> whether they like or not for their better health. Vendors should cultivate on this positive point of nutrition benefits of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> plus marketing skills to ensure high income through high sales. To achieve the project objectives, a participatory approach are necessary to be able to increase awareness to communities about the project equally nutrition education and consumption campaigns are continuously inevitable. In this view, stakeholders and policy makers are to be involved for project sustainability and up-scaling. The expected outcome is increased <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> consumption resulting to increased sales for sustainable income generation to vendors in general...|$|R

Similarly, pork typically contains 63mg while bacon contains 1,480mg, and potatoes contain 7mg but potato crisps 800mg per 100 g. The main sources of salt in the diet, apart from direct use of sodium chloride, are bread and cereal products, meat products and milk and dairy products.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly, {{however, the}} ice trade {{began to focus}} on {{supplying}} the growing cities on the east coast of the U.S. and the needs of businesses across the Midwest. The citizens of New York City and Philadelphia became huge consumers of ice during their long, hot summers, and additional ice was harvested from the Hudson River and Maine to fulfil the demand. Ice began to be used in refrigerator cars by the railroad industry, allowing the meat packing industry around Chicago and Cincinnati to slaughter cattle locally, sending dressed meat east for either the internal or overseas markets. Chilled refrigerator cars and ships created a national industry in <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> that could previously only have been consumed locally. American and British fishermen began to preserve their catches in ice, allowing longer voyages and bigger catches, and the brewing industry became operational all-year around.

Despite some endogenous innovations to improve <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> pesticide practices, farmers and exporters are especially responding {{to the demands of}} importers. Relatively lax import regulations from the main export markets (China and Russia) are the main reason for limited achievements in less-pesticide-dependent <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> production in Vietnam.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the prevalence of Campylobacter in fresh <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> at retail level in the Netherlands, and to estimate its implications on the importance of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> as risk factor for campylobacteriosis. Thirteen of the 5640 <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> samples were Campylobacter positive, resulting in a prevalence of 0. 23 % (95 % confidence interval (Cl) : 0. 12 – 0. 39 %). The prevalence of packaged products (0. 36 %, 95 % Cl: 0. 17 – 0. 66) was significantly higher than of unpackaged products (0. 07; 95 % Cl: 0. 01 – 0. 27). No statistical differences were found between seasons. Combining the mean prevalence found in this study with data on the consumption of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits,</b> an exposure of 0. 0048 campylobacters ingested per person per day in the Netherlands by transmission via <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruits,</b> was calculated. This exposure, as input in a Beta-Poisson dose–response model, resulted in an estimated number of 5. 3 × 105 cases of infection with Campylobacter per year for the whole Dutch population.
