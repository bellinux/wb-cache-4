In {{this study we}} examined subjects’ ability to interpolate circular curves—to derive the whole circle from an arc of 180 ° or less. Specifically, we tested how the center point is utilized during such visual interpolation. Naturally, a mechanism that interpolates by extending the curvature of the <b>visible</b> <b>arc</b> will be unaffected by {{the presence or absence}} of the center point. On the other hand, a mechanism that achieves the same end by completing the circle from estimates of the center and radius will be significantly aided by the presence of the center. We found that when the <b>visible</b> <b>arc</b> was long (180 °), presenting the circle’s center did not affect the precision with which subjects localized the invisible section. However, when the <b>visible</b> <b>arc</b> was relatively short (90 ° or 45 °), displaying the center point significantly increased spatial precision. Thus, both computational mechanisms appear to exist...|$|E

This provides the convenience to study the enhancement results of low earth orbiter satellite (LEO) to BDS precise orbit determination (POD). First the data characteristics and code observation noise of GNOS are analyzed. Then the enhancement experiments {{in the case of}} global and regional ground observation stations layout are processed with four POD schemes: BDS single system, GPS/BDS double system, BDS single system with GNOS observations, GPS/BDS double system with GNOS observations. The precision of BDS orbits and clock are compared via overlapping arcs. Results show {{that in the case of}} global station layout the along directional precision of GEO satellite has the biggest improvement, with the improvement percentage 60 %.

40|$|Measurements of {{the charge}} {{distribution}} in electron-bombarded, thin-film, and multilayer dielectric samples showed that charging of multilayered materials evolves with time and is highly dependent on incident energy; this is driven by electron penetration depth, electron emission, and material conductivity. Based on the net surface potential’s dependence on beam current, electron range, electron emission, and conductivity, measurements of the surface potential, displacement current, and beam energy allow the charge distribution to be inferred. To take these measurements, a thin-film disordered SiO 2 structure with a conductive middle layer was charged using 200 -eV and 5 -keV electron beams with regular 15 -s pulses at 1 – 500 nA/cm 2.

40|$|We {{discuss a}} model for the quasi-stationary {{coupling}} between magnetospheric sheared flows in the dusk sector and discrete auroral arcs, previously analyzed for the case of a uniform height-integrated Pedersen conductivity (&Sigma;P). Here we introduce an ionospheric feedback as the variation of &Sigma;P with the energy flux of precipitating magnetospheric electrons (&epsilon;em). One key-component of the model is the kinetic description of the interface between the duskward LLBL and the plasma sheet that gives the profile of &Phi;m, the magnetospheric electrostatic potential. The velocity shear in the dusk LLBL plays the role of a generator for the auroral circuit closing through Pedersen currents in the auroral ionosphere. The field-aligned current density, j||, and the energy flux of precipitating electrons are given by analytic functions of the field-aligned potential drop, &Delta;&Phi;, derived from standard kinetic models of the adiabatic motion of particles. The ionospheric electrostatic potential, &Phi;i (and implicitely &Delta;&Phi;) is determined from the current continuity equation in the ionosphere. We obtain values of &Delta;&Phi; of the order of kilovolt and of j|| of the order of tens of μA/m 2 in thin regions of the order of several kilometers at 200 km altitude. The spatial scale is significantly smaller and the peak values of &Delta;&Phi;, j|| and &epsilon;em are higher than {{in the case of a}} uniform &Sigma;P. Effects on the postnoon/evening auroral arc electrodynamics due to variations of dusk LLBL and solar wind dynamic and kinetic pressure are discussed. In thin regions (of the order of kilometer) embedding the maximum of &Delta;&Phi; we evidence a non-linear regime of the current-voltage relationship. The model predicts also that <b>visible</b> <b>arcs</b> form when the velocity shear in LLBL is above a threshold value depending on the generator and ionospheric plasma properties. Brighter arcs are obtained for increased velocity shear in the LLBL; their spatial scale remains virtually unmodified. The field-aligned potential drop tends to decrease with increasing LLBL density. For higher values of the LLBL electron temperature the model gives negative field-aligned potential drops in regions adjacent to upward field-aligned currents...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the reign}} of Napoleon III in the 1850s and 60s Paris {{experienced}} a dramatic transformation {{under the direction of}} Georges-Eugène Haussmann. Haussmann cut many boulevards through the crowded, medieval city placing prominent public buildings at the boulevard ends to provide impressive vistas. The boulevard Malesherbes was laid out cutting northwest from La Madeleine. Saint-Augustin, close to the spot where Haussmann was born, was built to provide a counterpoint to the famous columns of La Madeleine {{at the other end of}} the boulevard. It was also designed to be <b>visible</b> from the <b>Arc</b> de Triomphe down the avenue de Friedland. The chosen site, an odd shaped lot at the intersection of four streets, and the need for a dome of 200 ft so as to be <b>visible</b> from the <b>Arc</b> de Triomphe, dictated unusual proportions for the building. The church was designed by Haussmann's fellow Protestant, architect Victor Baltard who also famously designed Les Halles markets. While Baltard's use of iron in Saint-Augustin's structure is praised for its inventiveness, at least one critic has described the church as, [...] "an eyesore: ridiculously sited, without proportion, crushed beneath an outsized dome." [...] The neighborhood around the church is now one of the most expensive in Paris.|$|R
40|$|Charging of thin-film, {{multilayer}} dielectric materials {{subject to}} electron bombardment {{was found to}} evolve with time. The charging behavior was also highly dependent on the incident energy of the monoenergetic electron beams; this is driven by energy dependant processes including the electron penetration depth, electron emission, and material conductivity. The electron penetration depth is the average range to which incident electrons at a given incident energy penetrate into the material, thus defining the mean depth of an embedded charge layer. The secondary electron yield is the ratio of electrons emitted from the surface {{to the number of}} incident electrons; this ratio largely controls the magnitude of the surface charge layer. The material conductivity determines how easily charge layers can move with and out of the material, and hence the time evolution of the charge distribution. While range and yield are highly energy dependent, the conductivity depends more on beam power and is highly temperature dependent. Radiation induced conductivity becomes significant for high electron fluxes. Models based on the dependence of electron range, electron emission and conductivity on incident energy, flux and sample temperature allow the evolution of the internal charge distribution to be inferred from measurements of the net surface potential and displacement current. Measurements were made for thin film SiO 2 multilayer structures with a conductive middle layer charged, using 200 eV and 5 keV electron beams with regular 15 s pulses at 1 nA/cm 2 to 500 nA/cm 2. Results show that there are two basic charging scenarios. The first scenario, for incident energies between the crossover energies, is characterized by small positive net surface potentials, limited by electron emission and re-attraction of emitted electrons to the positive surface. The second scenario, for incident energies above the second crossover energy, is characterized by larger negative net surface potentials, limited by the conductivity and the breakdown voltage at which the material can no longer sustain electric fields produced by the deposited charge layers. Large negative net surface potentials led to electrostatic breakdown and large <b>visible</b> <b>arcs,</b> which can to lead to detrimental spacecraft charging effects. These measurements are shown to be quantitatively consistent with the simple charging models described above, using previous results of independent electron range, yields and conductivity measurements...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the formation of the acceleration region for electrons which produce the <b>visible</b> auroral <b>arc</b> and with the formation of the inverted V precipitation region. The former is embedded in the latter, and both are associated with field-aligned current sheets carried by plasma sheet electrons. It is shown that an electron current sheet driven from the plasma sheet into the ionosphere leads to the formation of a two-dimensional potential double layer. For a current sheet of a thickness less than the proton gyrodiameter solutions are obtained in which the field-aligned potential drop is distributed over a length much greater than the Debye length. For a current sheet of a thickness much greater than the proton gyrodiameter solutions are obtained in which the potential drop is confined to a distance on the order of the Debye length. The electric field in the two-dimensional double-layer model is the zeroth-order field inherent to the current sheet configuration, in contrast to those models in which the electric field is attributed to the first-order field due to current instabilities or turbulences. The maximum potential in the two-dimensional double-layer models is on the order of the thermal energy of plasma sheet protons, which ranges from 1 to 10 keV...|$|R

Also some of those signals utilize high-bitrate formats that cannot be received by many older receivers, even if those receivers are capable of receiving digital signals, and such signals may require a larger than usual dish for adequate reception.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether careful examination of angiograms {{in conjunction with other}} clinical information could reliably detect, quantitate and localize target lesion calcification before a coronary intervention. Background. The presence, extent and location of calcium in coronary artery lesions are important determinants of outcome after coronary intervention. Intravascular ultrasound is proposed as a superior technique for identifying patients with coronary artery calcification. However, the precise role of this costly and invasive method has not yet been established. Methods. Target lesion calcification was assessed in 183 patients (155 men; mean [±SD] age 58 ± 10 years) by angiography and intravascular ultrasound before a planned percutaneous coronary intervention. Results. Ultrasound detected calcium in 138 patients (270 ° in 8), whereas angiography showed calcification in 63 (1 + in 32, 2 + in 27 and 3 + in 4). The two techniques agreed in 92 patients and disagreed in 91. Sensitivity and specificity of angiography were 40 % and 82 %, respectively. The arc of calcium by ultrasound was greater in patients with angiographically visible calcification (175 ° ± 85 ° vs. 108 ° ± 71 °, p = 0. 0001). The depth of calcification by ultrasound was superficial in 61 patients (44 %), deep in 68 (49 %) and mixed in 8 (7 %). The sensitivity of angiography in identifying superficial calcium was 35 %. Of 120 patients without angiographically visible calcium at the target lesion site, 83 showed calcium by ultrasound. The only predictor of ultrasound calcium in these 120 patients was angiographic calcification elsewhere in the coronary tree (p = 0. 0001). The probability of any calcium and superficial > 90 ° calcium were 60 % and 12 %, respectively, in the 90 patients without angiographic calcifications anywhere in the coronary tree. Conclusions. Despite poor sensitivity, angiography may help identify patients requiring intravascular ultrasound. When it is angiographically <b>visible,</b> the <b>arc</b> of calcium is likely to be large and superficial. Angiographic calcification at a remote site is a predictor of angiographically undetected target lesion calcium.

40|$|Many planets orbit {{within an}} AU of their stars, raising {{questions}} about their origins. Particularly puzzling are the planets found near the silicate sublimation front. We investigate conditions near the front in the protostellar disk around a young intermediate-mass star, using the first global 3 -D radiation non-ideal MHD simulations in this context. We treat the starlight heating; the silicate grains sublimation and deposition at the local, time-varying temperature and density; temperature-dependent Ohmic dissipation; and various initial magnetic fields. The results show magnetorotational turbulence around the sublimation front at 0. 5 AU. The disk interior to 0. 8 AU is turbulent, with velocities exceeding 10 % of the sound speed. Beyond 0. 8 AU is the dead zone, cooler than 1000 K and with turbulence orders of magnitude weaker. A local pressure maximum just inside the dead zone concentrates solid particles, favoring their growth. Over many orbits, a vortex develops at the dead zones inner edge, increasing the disks thickness locally by around 10 %. We synthetically observe the results using Monte Carlo transfer calculations, finding the sublimation front is near-infrared bright. The models with net vertical magnetic fields develop extended, magnetically-supported atmospheres that reprocess extra starlight, raising the near-infrared flux 20 %. The vortex throws a nonaxisymmetric shadow on the outer disk. At wavelengths > 2 micron, the flux varies several percent on monthly timescales.

It is situated almost in {{the centre of the}} island and was originally provided with cottages for the keepers. The first light was a revolving white one which flashed every ten seconds, with a fixed red light below the main light, which could be seen over a 45-degree arc of danger from the reef. The main light's rotation was powered by a clockwork motor, driven by a large weight that descended down a cavity in the wall of the tower. The lights had a range of seventeen and fifteen miles respectively. A fog bell was also provided. The fixed red light was later replaced by a red sector on the main light itself. Originally, the light was manned by two men at a time, working two months on and one month off, but in 1939 the lighthouse was automated, a new second-order fixed catadioptric lens was installed and the keepers were withdrawn. Their cottages were subsequently demolished. In 2012 Trinity House discontinued use of the light within the tower, replacing it with an LED light mounted on a steel platform nearby on the rocks. Godrevy is still listed by Trinity House as a lighthouse, and the tower is maintained by them as a daymark. The new light maintains the same pattern as its predecessor, flashing white/red every ten seconds, with the red sector only being <b>visible</b> in the <b>arc</b> of danger from the reef. The range of the light is around 8 nmi km.|$|R
40|$|Recent quantum {{oscillation}} {{experiments in}} underdoped high temperature superconductors seem to imply two paradoxes. The first paradox concerns the apparent non-existence of {{the signature of}} the electron pockets in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The second paradox is a clear signature of a small electron pocket in quantum oscillation experiments, but no evidence as yet of the corresponding hole pockets of approximately double {{the frequency of the}} electron pocket. This hole pockets should be present if the Fermi surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate density wave, assuming that Luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total number of charge carriers holds. Here we provide possible resolutions of these apparent paradoxes from the commensurate $d$-density wave theory. To address the first paradox we have computed the ARPES spectral function subject to correlated disorder, natural to a class of experiments relevant to the materials studied in quantum oscillations. The intensity of the spectral function is significantly reduced for the electron pockets for an intermediate range of disorder correlation length, and typically less than half the hole pocket is <b>visible,</b> mimicking Fermi <b>arcs.</b> Next we show from an exact transfer matrix calculation of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation that the usual disorder affects the electron pocket more significantly than the hole pocket. However, when, in addition, the scattering from vortices in the mixed state is included, it wipes out the frequency corresponding to the hole pocket. Thus, if we are correct, {{it will be necessary to}} do measurements at higher magnetic fields and even higher quality samples to recover the hole pocket frequency. Comment: Accepted version, Phys.

40|$|Background and Aims Australian Spermacoce species display {{various types}} of {{elaborate}} petals. Their precise morphology, ontogenetic origin, and function are hitherto unknown. The aim of the present paper is to unravel the development {{and nature of the}} diverse types of elaborate petals in Spermacoce through a floral ontogenetic study. Methods The floral ontogeny of six species characterized by different types of corolla appendages was studied by scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. In order to elucidate the possible functions of the elaborate petals, field observations were conducted as well. Key Results Scanning electronmicrographs show that full-grown petals of Spermacoce lignosa, S. phaeosperma and S. redacta bear appendages on their ventral side. Despite their different appearance at anthesis, the appendages develop very similarly in all three species. They are initiated at the same developmental stage and are first <b>visible</b> as two <b>arcs</b> of primordia converging from the upper margins of the petal towards its midvein and downwards. In S. brevidens, S. caudata and S. erectiloba, the full-grown petals have two long, concave protuberances, which develop from the tissue at both sides of the petal’s mid-vein. In these three species, initiation of appendages on the ventral side of the petals is also observed, but they are hardly visible on the mature petals. The two types of elaborate petals tightly enclose the anthers, both in bud and during most of the flowering period. Conclusions Among Australian Spermacoce species, two types of elaborate petals can be distinguished. The former hypothesis that the two types of elaborate petals are essentially homologous is here rejected. Field investigations point out that the elaborate petals might {{play a role in the}} pollination biology of the species...|$|R
