40|$|The {{need for}} using {{light-weight}} and high-strength fibre reinforced polymer in different applications {{has increased in}} the past few decades. The ideal product offers excellent mechanical and chemical properties with much lower weight compared to traditionally used metals. Initially, the fibre-reinforced polymers are being produced by trial and error iterations. This causes a very expensive product, with random quality and lack of reproducibility. There is a need to replace trial and error experiments with knowledge-based approaches. Using sensors for in-situ production to monitor the results in a reliable and repeatable way gives a high-quality composite product and optimizes the time and cost of the process. One of the common manufacturing processes of fibre-reinforced polymer composite is resin infusion in dry fabrics. The resin impregnates the fibrous textile through the existence of a pressure gradient in the fibrous mat, which is generated by a vacuum pump or by a resin injection at high pressure. The impregnation of the dry textile {{is a result of the}} pressure gradient between resin inlet and <b>venting</b> <b>point</b> in the mold. Therefore, the most relevant measurement to detect the resin front and the changes of resin hydrostatic pressure is measuring the pressure directly inside the laminate. In this study, pressure sensors provide real-time information about the resin front in laminate and the changes of resin hydrostatic pressure during the infusion. Different pressure sensors and interconnection techniques were examined to minimize the size of the sensing element in the composite. After complete impregnation of the fibres, the curing degree of the resin has to be measured. Microscale interdigital capacitive sensors with a perforated substrate of polyimide are designed and fabricated. The sensors are fabricated on polyimide substrate with a thickness of about 5 micrometers. The polyimide is thermally stable up to 450 degree celsius. Therefore, the sensor can be used for a variety of processes even with high-temperature curing requirements. They have a volume of around 0. 1 mm 3. The miniaturized dimensions of the sensor enables it to remain in the composite product with the negligible diminishing of mechanical properties. The metallization of the sensor is insulated with metal oxide built up from the metallization itself. This insulation layer enables measurement in electrically conductive carbon fibres. The sensors will remain inside the composite material for structural health monitoring during the life-time of composite. Ideally, the sensors for online process monitoring of composites should be made of the identical fibres or resin in that composite. This will eliminate the wound effect in the host material. To obtain sensorial material, a high-performance resin for aerospace application, type RTM 6, is mixed with different plasticizers. The cured mixture of the resin is thin and flexible. An interdigital comb structure is screen-printed on the newly developed substrate. The curing degree of the RTM 6 resin in glass and carbon fibres is measured by screen-printed planar interdigital sensor on flexible RTM 6. Having sensors for online process monitoring is important for industry 4. 0 to autonomously produce fibre reinforced composites in a so-called smart factory. Both, pressure sensors and interdigital capacitive sensors in this thesis can be used for online process monitoring. They will provide a knowledge-based approach for high-quality and low-cost products...|$|R

40|$|The shallow-sea {{hydrothermal}} <b>vents</b> at White <b>Point</b> (WP) in Palos Verdes (PV) on {{the southern}} California coast support microbial mats and provide easily accessed settings in which to study chemolithoautotrophic sulfur cycling. Previous studies have cultured sulfur-oxidizing bacteria from the WP mats; however, almost nothing {{is known about the}} in situ diversity and activity of the microorganisms in these habitats. We studied the diversity, micron-scale spatial associations and metabolic activity of the mat community via sequence analysis of 16 S rRNA and aprA genes, Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) microscopy and sulfate-reduction rate (SRR) measurements. Sequence analysis revealed a diverse group of bacteria, dominated by sulfur cycling gamma-, epsilon- and deltaproteobacterial lineages such as Marithrix, Sulfurovum and Desulfuromusa. FISH microscopy suggests a close physical association between sulfur-oxidizing and sulfur-reducing genotypes, while radiotracer studies showed low, but detectable, SRR. Comparative 16 S rRNA gene sequence analyses indicate the WP sulfur vent microbial mat community is similar, but distinct from other hydrothermal vent communities representing a range of biotopes and lithologic settings.

40|$|Novel, vacuolate sulfur {{bacteria}} {{occur at}} shallow hydrothermal <b>vents</b> near White <b>Point,</b> Calif. There, these filaments are attached densely to diverse biotic and abiotic substrates and extend one to several centimeters {{into the surrounding}} environment, where they are alternately exposed to sulfidic and oxygenated seawater. Characterizations of native filaments collected from this location indicate that these filaments possess novel morphological and physiological properties compared to all other vacuolate bacteria characterized to date. Attached filaments, ranging in diameter from 4 to 100 μm or more, were composed of cylindrical cells, each containing a thin annulus of sulfur globule-filled cytoplasm surrounding a large central vacuole. A near-complete 16 S rRNA gene sequence was obtained and confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization to be associated only with filaments having a diameter of 10 μm or more. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these wider, attached filaments form within the gamma proteobacteria a monophyletic group that includes all previously described vacuolate sulfur bacteria (the genera Beggiatoa, Thioploca, and Thiomargarita) and no nonvacuolate genera.

40|$|High-resolution {{bathymetry}} and {{a grid of}} single-channel reflection seismic profiles (Sparker and Chirp) {{were recently}} recorded in a sector of the upper slope of Capo Vaticano (CV) promontory (Tyrrhenian coast, W Calabria) where forward and inverse modeling of previously acquired aeromagnetic data highlight {{the presence of a}} WNW© elongated, 20 km long and 3 ¨C 5 km wide, magnetized body extending from sea floor to about 3 km below sea level. Magnetic properties of this body are consistent with those of the medium to highly evolved volcanic rocks of the Aeolian Arc (De Ritis et al., 2010). Forthwith offshore promontory, the bathymetry highlights a complex-shape seamount that develops along a WNW direction, orthogonally interrupted by NE-trending ridges (Loreto et al., 2013), the largest of which shows major- and minor-axes of ca. 11 and 2 km, respectively. Summit elevation is ca. 70 m. Several <b>vented</b> fluids <b>points</b> were imaged on top of the seamount by chirp profiles. The largest of which rises from seafloor up to 6 / 7 m within water column, assuming the acoustic water velocity of 1500 m/s. Two faults systems associated with extensional faults are mainly observed on seismic profiles. High-angle NW-trending normal faults, SW-dipping, formed along the continental slope connecting the south-west continental shelf of the CV promontory to the Gioia Tauro basin (Pepe et al., 2013). These faults generally have small displacements, up to 40 m, and are sealed by Pleistocene deposits. A NE-trending normal fault, SE-dipping, is also observed on both chirp and sparker profiles. Its length is estimate to be more than 30 km, partially borders the NE-trending ridge intersecting the NW-trending fault. Landward, another NE-trending normal fault affects Pliocene and lower Pleistocene, and is sealed by upper Pleistocene. The described new geophysical data lead to a re-examination of the magnetic anomaly field interpretation. In fact, the revealed NE-trending ridge encounters the CV NW-SE ridge just where the peak value of the Reduced-to-the-Pole magnetic anomaly lies. Therefore, the inherent source body is emplaced where the maximum fracturing occurs. This suggests highly magnetized material crystallized in a vertical conduit that fed a volcanic system, likely fault-controlled, surrounded by the almost not magnetized rocks of the Gioia and the Paola sedimentary basins and of the Arco Calabro Peloritano units...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{includes}} a literature survey of small hydraulic turbines, incorporating a historical review. The possible role of "micro hydros" in generating power {{in various parts}} of the world, and particularly in Iran, is discussed. The theory of turbo machinery, particularly with regard to axial flow turbines, is presented next. This is followed by some details on the design of guide vanes, runner blades and draft tube of axial flow turbines, these components being usually regarded as areas which have major impact on the performance of hydraulic turbines. The next chapter gives the details of the test circuit that was constructed. This could provide water volume flow rates of up to 0. 15 m 3 /s at heads of up 25 m. The two dynamometers that were used could adsorb pores to up to 25 kw and 50 kw respectively. An existing micro-turbine, the Agnew turbine, was selected for examination and possible improvement. The first possible improvement was the introduction of guide vanes upstream of the turbine runner (this inclusion necessitated a second support for the main shaft). It was found that this gave significant improvements - efficiency raised by over 20 % in some cases. The domain of high efficiency working was considerably extended. It was observed that instability (with fall in power output) could occur after a period of running.

40|$|The {{formation}} of lava tubes {{is a common}} phenomenon on some basaltic volcanoes, such as Etna. A model for tube formation by roofing of a channel is proposed and involves first describing lava as a Bingham liquid flowing down a slope. It is further assumed that lava flows in a channel with rectangular cross section: {{as a result of}} heat loss into the atmosphere, a crust is gradually formed on the upper surface of the flow and this crust eventually welds to the channel levees. We assume that a lava tube is formed when such a crust is sufficiently thick to resist the drag of the underlying flow and to sustain itself under its own weight. The minimum thickness of the crust satisfying such conditions depends on the tensile strength and shear strength of the crust itself. Assuming that the growth of the crust produces a downflow linear increase of the shear stress at the interface between flowing lava and the crust, the distance is evaluated between the eruption <b>vent</b> and the <b>point</b> where the tube is formed. The model predicts that if the flow rate is constant, the thickness of the flow increases as the crust fragments grow and weld to each other, and the velocity of the crust decreases to zero. Once the lava tube is formed, the initial flow rate can be achieved by a Row thickness smaller than the vertical size of the tube, with the same viscous dissipation: this may explain why under steady state conditions, the lava level inside a tube is frequently lower than the roof of the tube itself...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Muliwai a Pele lava channel was emplaced {{during the}} final stage of Mauna Ulu’s 1969 – 1974 {{eruption}} (Kilauea, Hawaii). The event was fountain-fed and lasted for around 50 h, during which time a channelized flow system developed, in which a 6 -km channel fed a zone of dispersed flow that extended a further 2. 6 km. The channel was surrounded by initial rubble levees of ’a’a, capped by overflow units of limited extent. We sampled the uppermost overflow unit every 250 m down the entire channel length, collecting, and analyzing 27 air-quenched samples. Bulk chemistry, density and textural analyses were carried out on the sample interior, and glass chemistry and microlite crystallization analyses were completed on the quenched crust. Thermal and rheological parameters (cooling, crystallization rate, viscosity, and yield strength) were also calculated. Results show that all parameters experience a change around 4. 5 km from the <b>vent.</b> At this <b>point,</b> there is a lava surface transition from pahoehoe to ’a’a. Lava density, microlite content, viscosity, and yield strength all increase down channel, but vesicle content and lava temperature decrease. Cooling rates were 6. 7 °C/km, with crystallization rates increasing from 0. 03 [*]Фc/km proximally, to 0. 14 [*]Фc/km distally. Modeling of the channel was carried out using the FLOWGO thermo-rheological model and allowed fits for temperature, microlite content, and channel width when run using a three-phase viscosity model based on a temperature-dependent viscosity relation derived for this lava. The down flow velocity profile suggests an initial velocity of 27 m/s, declining to 1 m/s {{at the end of the}} channel. Down-channel, lava underwent cooling that induced crystallization, causing both the lava viscosity and yield strength to increase. Moreover, lava underwent degassing and a subsequent vesicularity decrease. This aided in increasing viscosity, with the subsequent increase in shearing promoting a transition to ’a’a...|$|R

About 500, 000 people living or working around its fertile flanks are subject to {{significant}} threat from lava flow inundation. Lava flow hazard and risk were assessed by simulating probable lava flow paths using the DOWNFLOW code. The vent opening probability density function and lava flow length distribution were determined on the basis of available data from past eruptions at Mt. Cameroon volcano. Code calibration was performed through comparison with real lava flow paths. The topographic basis for simulations was the 90 -m resolution SRTM DEM. Simulated lava flows from about 80, 000 possible vents were used to produce a detailed lava flow hazard map. The lava flow risk in the area was mapped by combining the hazard map with digitized infrastructures (i. e., human settlements and roads). Results show that the risk of lava flow inundation is greatest in the most inhabited coastal areas comprising the town of Limbe, which constitutes the center of Cameroon’s oil industry and an important commercial port. Buea, the second most important town in the area, has a much lower risk although it is significantly closer to the summit of the volcano. Non-negligible risk characterizes many villages and most roads in the area surrounding the volcano.

The gradient ranged from extreme high temperatures, high sulfide concentrations, and low pH at sulfide chimneys to ambient deep-sea water conditions on bare basalt. We explore meiofauna diversity and abundance, and discuss its possible underlying ecological and evolutionary processes. Methodology/Principal Findings: After sampling in five physico-chemically different habitats, the meiofauna was sorted, counted and classified. Abundances were low at all sites. A total of 52 species were identified at vent habitats. The vent community was dominated by hard substrate generalists that also lived on bare basalt at ambient deep-sea temperature in the axial summit trough (AST generalists). Some vent species were restricted to a specific vent habitat (vent specialists), but others occurred {{over a wide range}} of physico-chemical conditions (vent generalists). Additionally, 35 species were only found on cold bare basalt (basalt specialists). At vent sites, species richness and diversity clearly increased with decreasing influence of vent fluid emissions from extreme flow sulfide chimney (no fauna), high flow pompei worm (S: 4 - 7, H-loge&# 39;: 0. 11 - 0. 45), vigorous flow tubeworm (S: 8 - 23; H-loge&# 39;: 0. 44 - 2. 00) to low flow mussel habitats (S: 28 - 31; H-loge&# 39;: 2. 34 - 2. 60). Conclusions/Significance: Our data suggest that with increasing temperature and toxic hydrogen sulfide concentrations and increasing amplitude of variation of these factors, fewer species are able to cope with these extreme conditions. This results in less diverse communities in more extreme habitats. The finding of many species being present at sites with and without <b>vent</b> fluid emissions <b>points</b> to a non endemic deep-sea hydrothermal vent meiofaunal community. This is in contrast to a mostly endemic macrofauna but similar to what is known for meiofauna from shallow-water vents...|$|R
