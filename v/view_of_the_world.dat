5|$|On June 5, 2003, {{during the}} first term of George W.

5|$|From the start, {{the film}} moves {{continuously}} between Barton's subjective <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> {{and one which}} is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera pans down to Barton, watching {{the end of his}} play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the ideas}} in The Satanic Bible are shaped around a secular, {{scientific}} <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> However, some of these ideas continue beyond present-day secularism by implying that various occult forces are not supernatural, but rather thus far undiscovered by science. These forces {{are said to be}} manipulable by the practitioner of LaVeyan Satanism, a trait of the religion that has been compared with Christian Science and Scientology.|$|E

40|$|Augmented reality (AR) is an {{emerging}} technology, which allows computer-generated graphical {{information to be}} correlated with a person’s <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real <b>world</b> (see Figure 1). These graphics can be placed in three po-sitions relative to the real world: (1) in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real <b>world,</b> (2) on <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real <b>world,</b> and (3) beyond <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real <b>world.</b> For decades re-searchers have studied perception using artificial stimuli (both computer-generated and non-computer-generated), as well as natural scenery. While many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results will doubtless be found to apply to AR, AR itself provides a display capability which is qualitatively different from those which have been previously studied. This is partic-ularly true for graphics drawn on <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real <b>world</b> (which look like computer-drawn signs or labels) ...|$|R
5|$|The son of {{a wealthy}} {{landowner}} and cleric, Heber gained an early reputation at the University of Oxford as a poet. After graduation, he expanded his <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> by undertaking, {{at the height of}} the Napoleonic Wars, an extended tour of Scandinavia, Russia and central Europe. He was ordained in 1807, and took over his father's old parish of Hodnet in Shropshire. He combined his pastoral duties with other church offices, hymn-writing, and more general literary work which included a critical study of the complete works of the 17th-century cleric Jeremy Taylor.|$|E
5|$|<b>View</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> {{has been}} parodied by Ted Rall, Columbia Pictures, The New Yorker, The Economist and Mad Magazine, among others. The {{work has been}} imitated and printed without {{authorization}} {{in a variety of}} ways. The Columbia parody led to a ruling by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. in favor of Steinberg because of copyright violations by Columbia Pictures. The work is {{regarded as one of the}} greatest magazine covers of recent generations and is studied by art students around the world.|$|E
5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E

5|$|During the 16th {{century the}} Ethiopian biographical {{tradition}} became far more complex, intertextual, and broader in its <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> given Ethiopia's direct {{involvement in the}} conflicts between the Ottoman and Portuguese empires in the Red Sea region. The annals of Dawit II (r. 1508–1540) describe the defensive war he waged against the Adal sultan Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (r. 1527–1543), in an episodic format {{quite different from the}} earlier chronicling tradition. The chronicle of Gelawdewos, perhaps written by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church abbot Enbaqom (1470–1560), is far more detailed than any previous Ethiopian work of history. It explains the Ethiopian emperor's military alliance with Cristóvão da Gama (1516–1542), son of the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, against the Adal Sultan al-Ghazi and his Ottoman allies, and later against the Ottoman governor of Yemen, Özdemir Pasha (d. 1560).|$|E
5|$|In {{different}} eras, various gods {{were said}} to hold the highest position in divine society, including the solar deity Ra, the mysterious god Amun, and the mother goddess Isis. The highest deity was usually credited {{with the creation of}} the world and often connected with the life-giving power of the sun. Some scholars have argued, based in part on Egyptian writings, that the Egyptians came to recognize a single divine power that lay behind all things and was present in all the other deities. Yet they never abandoned their original polytheistic <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> except possibly during the era of Atenism in the 14th century BC, when official religion focused exclusively on the impersonal sun god Aten.|$|E
5|$|Koṇḍañña {{thereafter}} {{vowed that}} he would follow when Siddhartha became an ascetic {{to learn from the}} future Buddha's findings. In the meantime, Suddhodana attempted to foil Koṇḍañña's prediction because he wanted his son to succeed him in ruling and expanding the kingdom. Suddhodana made intricate arrangements to shield Siddhartha from all worldly suffering in order to steer his mind away from spiritual matters, pampering him with all the material luxury and sense pleasures that he could find. However, Siddhartha finally persuaded his father to allow him out of the palace to meet his subjects. Suddhodana agreed, but attempted to present a sanitised image of human existence by ordering beggars, old people and sick people to be kept from the streets. Despite this, Siddhartha saw the four sights which prompted him to reevaluate his <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

50|$|Noël Marie Paymal Lerebours (16 February 1807 - 23 July 1873) was a French {{optician}} and daguerreotypist.

5|$|Peyton {{has noted}} that the {{distinct}} personalities of the series' characters meant that he considered some of them {{much more difficult to}} convincingly write for than others. He found Cooper to be particularly tricky to write for, as the character had an idiosyncratic <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> which needed to be maintained; but found Audrey Horne to be his favourite to work on as he considered the character—and actress Sherilyn Fenn—to be both sexy and smart, and to have developed substantially as the series progressed. The character of Madeline Ferguson was named for characters in Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo—Kim Novak's Madeleine Elster and James Stewart's Scottie Ferguson. Ferguson's cousin, the murdered schoolgirl Laura Palmer, was similarly named after the titular character in Otto Preminger's 1944 film Laura; while other characters in the series would also be named for film noir characters.|$|E
5|$|Physically, Britten {{was never}} robust. He walked and swam {{regularly}} and kept himself as fit as he could, but Carpenter in his 1992 biography mentions 20 illnesses, {{a few of}} them minor but most fairly serious, suffered over the years by Britten before his final heart complaint developed. Emotionally, according to some commentators, Britten never completely grew up, retaining in his outlook something of a child's <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> He was not always confident that he was the genius others declared him to be, and though he was hypercritical of his own works, he was acutely, even aggressively sensitive to criticism from anybody else.|$|E
5|$|Spiritualism {{appealed to}} many educated Victorians {{who no longer}} found {{traditional}} religious doctrine, {{such as that of}} the Church of England, acceptable yet were unsatisfied with the completely materialistic and mechanical <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> that was increasingly emerging from 19th-century science. However, several scholars who have researched Wallace's views in depth have emphasised that, for him, spiritualism was a matter of science and philosophy rather than religious belief. Among other prominent 19th-century intellectuals involved with spiritualism were the social reformer Robert Owen, who was one of Wallace's early idols, the physicists William Crookes and Lord Rayleigh, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan, and the Scottish publisher Robert Chambers.|$|E
