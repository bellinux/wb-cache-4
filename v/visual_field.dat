5|$|Pressure on {{the part}} of the optic nerve known as the chiasm, which is located above the gland, leads to loss of vision on the outer side of the <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> on both sides, as this {{corresponds}} to areas on the retinas supplied by these parts of the optic nerve; it is encountered in 75% of cases. Visual acuity is reduced in half, and over 60% have a <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> defect. The visual loss depends on which part of the nerve is affected. If the part of the nerve between the eye and the chiasm is compressed, the result is vision loss in one eye. If the part after the chiasm is affected, visual loss on one side of the <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> occurs.|$|E
5|$|At {{one year}} of age, joint {{attention}} is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as an intentional act. One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> before objects beyond their current <b>visual</b> <b>field.</b> At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see. At age 15 months, children recognize the minds of others. At this age, children also {{recognize the importance of}} eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight. At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> and establishing (representative) joint attention. 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the mentalistic experience of seeing and the role of eyes and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision. At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well. Two-year-olds are also capable of representational thought or increased memory.|$|E

5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects {{specific}} aspects of vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A person {{may not be able to}} see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the <b>visual</b> <b>field,</b> or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. <b>Visual</b> <b>field</b> testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the visual pathways.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} on whether to surgically decompress the pituitary gland is complex and mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> defects. If visual acuity is severely reduced, there are large or worsening <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> defects, or the level of consciousness falls consistently, professional guidelines recommend that surgery is performed. Most commonly, operations on the pituitary gland are performed through transsphenoidal surgery. In this procedure, surgical instruments are passed through the nose towards the sphenoid bone, which is opened to give access to the cavity that contains the pituitary gland. Surgery is most likely to improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery, and if surgery is undertaken within a week of the onset of symptoms.|$|E

5|$|Vision is {{generated}} by light that hits the retina of the eye. Photoreceptors in the retina transduce the sensory stimulus of light into an electrical nerve signal that {{is sent to the}} visual cortex in the occipital lobe. Vision from the left <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> is received {{on the right side of}} each retina (and vice versa) and passes through the optic nerve until some information changes sides, so that all information about one side of the <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> passes through tracts in the opposite side of the brain. The nerves reach the brain at the lateral geniculate nucleus, and travel through the optic radiation to reach the visual cortex.|$|E
5|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>field</b> {{testing is}} {{recommended}} {{as soon as}} possible after diagnosis, as it quantifies the severity of any optic nerve involvement, and may be required to decide on surgical treatment.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{relatively}} mild <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> loss or double vision only may be managed conservatively, with close {{observation of the}} level of consciousness, visual fields, and results of routine blood tests. If there is any deterioration, or expected spontaneous improvement does not occur, surgical intervention may still be indicated.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether the ability to document improvement in <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> after intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction can be enhanced by focusing on regions of the field with different levels of sensitivity. DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: This is a retrospective study. SETTING: Yale Eye Center. STUDY POPULATION: the <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> (Octopus G 2) of 30 eyes of 30 patients undergoing trabeculectomy. OBSERVATION PROCEDURE: <b>Visual</b> <b>fields</b> were evaluated a mean of three months before and 7. 8 months after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in sensitivity between the preoperative and postoperative <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> (Delta S) was evaluated globally by comparing all 59 points of sensitivity and regionally in three groups according to preoperative sensitivity (pre-S) : 25 % of highest, 50 % intermediate, and 25 % of lowest points of sensitivity. Improvement in Delta S was also correlated with preoperative mean defect (pre-MD), percent intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction (Delta IOP%), and patient's age. RESULTS: Six <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> showed improvement in Delta S when evaluated globally and nine showed improvement in pre-S subgroups. of the latter, all nine showed improvement in the subgroup with the lowest pre-S, and two in the intermediate subgroup, but none in the subgroup with the highest pre-S. Combining the subgroups with the lowest pre-S and the highest Delta IOP% {{was associated with the}} highest mean Delta S. CONCLUSION: the ability to document improvement in <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> following surgical reduction of IOP may be enhanced by focusing on subgroups of test points with lower baseline sensitivity.

5|$|An {{increase}} in intracranial pressure {{may lead to}} impairment of the optic nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema). A cancer, such as an optic glioma, may also impact the optic nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the optic tracts or the optic chiasm of the optic nerve (II), leading to <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculuomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.|$|E
5|$|If one {{of these}} tests shows a {{deficiency}} of hormones produced by the pituitary, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary {{is the first step}} in identifying an underlying cause. MRI may show various tumors and may assist in delineating other causes. Tumors smaller than 1cm are referred to as microadenomas, and larger lesions are called macroadenomas. Computed tomography with radiocontrast may be used if MRI is not available. Formal <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> testing by perimetry is recommended, as this would show evidence of optic nerve compression by a tumor.|$|E

The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.|$|E
5|$|Pituitary {{apoplexy}} or pituitary tumor apoplexy is bleeding into or impaired {{blood supply}} of the pituitary gland {{at the base of}} the brain. This usually occurs in the presence of a tumor of the pituitary, although in 80% of cases this has not been diagnosed previously. The most common initial symptom is a sudden headache, often associated with a rapidly worsening <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> defect or double vision caused by compression of nerves surrounding the gland. This is followed in many cases by acute symptoms caused by lack of secretion of essential hormones, predominantly adrenal insufficiency.|$|E
5|$|Pituitary tumors require {{treatment}} {{when they}} are causing specific symptoms, such as headaches, <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> defects or excessive hormone secretion. Transsphenoidal surgery (removal of the tumor by an operation through the nose and the sphenoidal sinuses) may, apart from addressing symptoms related to the tumor, also improve pituitary function, although the gland is sometimes damaged further {{as a result of}} the surgery. When the tumor is removed by craniotomy (opening the skull), recovery is less likely–but sometimes this is the only suitable way to approach the tumor. After surgery, it may take some time for hormone levels to change significantly. Retesting the pituitary hormone levels is therefore performed 2 to 3 months later.|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{duration}} of the perimetric examination was significantly shortened by development of fast perimetric strategies. By analyzing the results of normal, dynamic and TOP strategy we studied the differences in determination of MD, LV, in determination of number of all points with a deficit and number of points with a significant deficit of p < 0. 5 %. Methods. 22 normal <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> of 17 subjects (mean age 33 ± 15 years) and 22 <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> with defects of 17 patients (47 ± 16 years) having different types and degrees of visual lesions were examined. All <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> were examined once with each strategy in alternating order using Octopus 101 perimeter with the G 2 program. Results. No statistically significant differences were measured in MD values. In abnormal <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> group, TOP strategy showed 11 ± 14 dB 2 lower LV values compared to dynamic strategy (p < 0. 01) and 9. 8 ± 16 dB 2 lower LV values compared to normal strategy (p = 0. 02). In the abnormal <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> group the dynamic strategy measured in average 3 points with the deficit less {{compared to the other}} two strategies (p < 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences between}} strategies in the number of points with a deficit of p < 0. 5 %. Conclusions. With the exception of lower LV values measured with TOP strategy, the differences between TOP, dynamic strategy results are small and the time sparing benefits are substantial. Therefore the usage of fast perimetric strategies is clinically justified. </p...|$|R

5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{continued}} his experiments on perception, branching into studies on pseudoscopic vision, stereoscopic acuity, eye movements, symmetry and visual illusions, how people perceive depth seeing surroundings either one-eyed or two-eyed, acuity {{and limits of}} peripheral vision, apparent motion, afterimages impressed on the eye when a person stares at an object for long and then looks away, and problems with sight in half the <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> (hemianopsia). He both reviewed earlier studies on motion and conducted two of his own, concluding perceiving movement {{was more than the}} sum of seeing successive sequential images. He also surveyed and reported in reviews in the Psychological Bulletin experiments at various labs, including those in Europe, on matters related to sensation and perception.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the right side of the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the <b>visual</b> <b>field,</b> the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the <b>visual</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
