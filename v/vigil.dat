5000|$|The night office {{retained}} {{for some}} time its name of <b>vigils,</b> since, as a rule, <b>vigils</b> and matins (lauds) were combined, the latter serving, to a certain extent, as the closing part of <b>vigils.</b> The name matins was then extended {{to the office of}} <b>vigils,</b> and the original Matins took the name of lauds, a term which, strictly speaking, only designated the last three psalms of that office, i.e., the [...] "Laudate" [...] psalms. At the time when this change of name took place, the custom of saying <b>vigils</b> at night was observed scarcely anywhere but in monasteries, whilst elsewhere they were said in the morning, so that finally it did not seem a misapplication to give to a night Office a name which, strictly speaking, applied only to the office of day-break. The change, however, was only gradual. St. Benedict (6th century) in his description of the liturgy of the hours, always refers to <b>vigils</b> as the night office, whilst that of day-break he calls matins, lauds being the last three psalms of that office, those excised in the reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X (Regula, cap. XIII-XIV; see Lauds). The Council of Tours in 567 had already applied the title [...] "matins" [...] to the night office: ad Matutinum sex antiphonae. Laudes Matutinae; Matutini hymni are also found in various ancient authors as synonymous with Lauds.|$|R

5|$|At the {{procession}} to George's lying in state in Westminster Hall {{part of the}} Imperial State Crown fell from {{on top of the}} coffin and landed in the gutter as the cort√®ge turned into New Palace Yard.
