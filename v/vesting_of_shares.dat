50|$|An {{example of}} {{the breadth of the}} concept of {{property}} in section 51(xxxi) is provided by Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth (the Bank Nationalisation Case). In that case, Federal legislation contemplated the acquisition of private banks through <b>vesting</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> in private banks in the Commonwealth, and later the appointment of directors by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. Justice Dixon characterised the provisions as removing effective control over the property of the private banks. He concluded that this was, in the essential sense, an acquisition of a proprietary right.|$|E
40|$|This article {{develops}} {{a theory of}} contracting among founders of a new firm. It asks at what stage founders agree to commit to each other, how they structure optimal founder contracts, and how this affects team formation, ownership, incentives, and performance. The article derives a trade-off between upfront contracting, which can result in teams with ineffective founders, versus delayed contracting, which can enable some founders to appropriate ideas and start their own firms. Delayed contracting becomes more attractive when there are significant doubts about the skills of founders. We show that contingent con-tracts with <b>vesting</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> {{may be used to}} mitigate inefficiencies in the team formation process. We also show that laws that provide protection to implied partnerships may have the unintended effect of encouraging more formal contracting. (JEL D 82, D 86, K 12, L 26). 1...|$|E

He received a lump sum payment for more than $3 million, and the <b>vesting</b> <b>of</b> 135,000 <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> restricted stock upon his resignation. Seven months before his resignation, Toback ceded effective control of the Bally board of directors to John Rogers, chief executive of Ariel Capital Management, who was named as [...] "lead director." [...] Prior to his resignation, Toback alleged that major Bally shareholder Emanuel Pearlman of Liberation Investments and former Bally CEO Lee Hillman were behind calls for his ouster, which Pearlman and Hillman denied.|$|R

Unlike the Colorado or Idaho codes, neither Alaska's nor Wyoming regulations define the perimeters of {{ownership in the}} context of a herdshare agreement.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} motives for {{disclosing}} an alternative {{earnings per share}} (EPS) figure. In particular, we extend prior findings for the UK (Choi, Lin, Walker & Young, 2007) by highlighting the role of managerial contracting in the alternative EPS disclosure choice. We examine a specific contractual setting where management is especially sensitive to reported earnings numbers, i. e., when EPS performance targets exist in the managerial remuneration package. Our analysis suggests that the choice to disclose an alternative EPS figure is positively related to firms where the <b>vesting</b> <b>of</b> executive <b>share</b> options (ESOs) is contingent on the achievement of growth in EPS. Our results remain significant after testing for selection bias, direction of causality and after matching firms on variables prior literature identifies as influential {{in the choice of}} an EPS target as a performance criterion in executive remuneration...|$|R
