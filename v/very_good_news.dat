In 2008, as Chicago struggled to close a growing budget deficit, the city agreed to a 75-year, $1.16 billion deal to lease its parking meter system to an operating company created by Morgan Stanley. Daley said the [...] "agreement is <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for the taxpayers of Chicago because it will provide more than $1 billion in net proceeds that can be used during this very difficult economy." [...] The agreement quadrupled rates, in the first year alone, while the hours which people have to pay for parking were broadened from 9 a.m. – 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. – 9 p.m., and from Monday through Saturday to every day of the week. Additionally, the city agreed to compensate the new owners for loss of revenue any time any road with parking meters is closed by the city for anything from maintenance work to street festivals. In three years, the proceeds from the lease were all but spent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{examine whether}} arbitrageurs amplify {{fundamental}} shocks {{in the context}} of short arbitrage in equity markets. The ability of arbitrageurs to hold on to short positions depends on asset values: shorts are often reduced (increased) following <b>good</b> (bad) <b>news</b> about a stock. As a result, the prices of highly shorted stocks are excessively sensitive to economic shocks. Using monthly short interest data we find the following. (1) The price of a highly shorted stock is more sensitive to earnings news than a stock with little short interest. (2) The change in short interest around announcements (proxied by share turnover) is more sensitive to earnings surprises for highly shorted stocks. (3) For highly shorted stocks, returns to shorting are higher following better earnings news (after accounting for post earnings announcement drift). These results continue to hold when we exploit differences in short selling regulations across stock exchanges to instrument for the amount of shorting in a stock. These differential sensitivities tend to be driven by <b>very</b> <b>good</b> earnings <b>news</b> as opposed to very bad earnings news. Our findings point to the importance of limited arbitrage in affecting asset price dynamics and the potentially destabilizing role of speculators...|$|R

60|$|Now, it {{is worth}} {{remarking}} that we--I mean even religious people-- speak {{very little about the}} kingdom of God nowadays. One hears less about it than about any other words, almost, which stand in the New Testament. Both in sermons and in religious books, and in the talk of godly people, one hears the kingdom of God spoken of very seldom. One hears words about the Church, which are <b>very</b> <b>good</b> and true; but very little, if anything, about the kingdom of God, though both St. Paul, and St. John, and the blessed Lord Himself, speak of the two together, as if they could not be parted; as if one could not think of the one without thinking of the other. And we hear words about the gospel, too, some of them <b>very</b> <b>good</b> and true, and others, I am sorry to say, very bad and false: but, true or false, they are not often joined now in men's minds, or mouths, or books, with the kingdom of God. But the New Testament joins them almost always. It says that gospel must be <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> Therefore the gospel must be <b>good</b> <b>news</b> about something. But about what? We hear all manner of answers nowadays; but we hear the right one very seldom. People talk of the gospel as if it only meant the <b>good</b> <b>news</b> that one man can be saved here, and another man can be saved there. And that is <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> certainly. It is <b>good</b> and blessed <b>news</b> to hear that any one poor sinner can be saved from sin, and from the wages of sin. But the holy scriptures, when they talk of the gospel, call it the gospel of the kingdom of God. And I think it best and wisest to call it oftenest, what the holy scripture calls it oftenest, and to try and understand, first of all, what that means, what the <b>good</b> <b>news</b> of the kingdom of God is: and to understand that, we must first understand what the kingdom of God is.|$|R

40|$|Is {{it always}} wise to boast about <b>good</b> <b>news?</b> When {{messages}} are verifiable, the standard result from disclosure games is that <b>good</b> <b>news</b> should be disclosed or the receiver will infer that the sender has nothing favorable to report.

In addition, I find that firms do not fabricate <b>good</b> <b>news</b> to follow <b>good</b> <b>news</b> forecasts of peer firms, only choosing to reveal <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> These findings suggest that managers herd on early <b>good</b> <b>news</b> forecasts to avoid their stock prices being discounted by investors, but not on early bad news forecasts because managers hope that subsequent favorable events may bury early bad news. published_or_final_versionBusinessDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
