5|$|Sex-positive feminist writer Susie Bright {{called the}} Magic Wand {{one of her}} two {{favorite}} <b>vibrators,</b> and called it a miracle that the device {{was able to bring}} about a orgasm in under sixty seconds. Bright wrote about her experience using the Magic Wand to relieve discomfort during childbirth. Author Kathy Shaidle wrote that the massager is able to give females multiple orgasms. Shaidle wrote that its effectiveness was not hampered by its appearance which brought to mind objects featured in the Mütter Museum. Sociologist, sexologist and sex-positive feminist Carol Queen critiqued the carbon footprint of the Magic Wand because it was imported from Japan, and praised its environmentally friendly qualities including its lack of batteries, and durability compared to other <b>vibrators.</b>|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 {{paper for}} the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, authors Anna Eaglin and Shaowen Bardzell {{discussed}} the Magic Wand {{within the context}} of devices used in sexual behavior that were not originally created for that purpose. A 2012 study published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy evaluated seven <b>vibrators</b> for use with clinical therapy for sexual stimulation. They found that the Magic Wand displayed a high degree of movement and oscillation. The researchers suggested that their data could be used by therapists to select the optimum vibrator which could deliver both effectiveness and sensitivity for their clients.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{exist to}} measure how much {{sensation}} a person has retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people {{who are able to}} achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as <b>vibrators</b> are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap can be added to a vibrator or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function.|$|E
40|$|A micro {{ultrasonic}} motor using a micro-machined cylindrical bulk piezoelectric <b>vibrator</b> is introduced. This motor {{consists of}} the <b>vibrator,</b> a glass case and a rotor. The diameter of the piezoelectric <b>vibrator</b> is 0. 8 mm {{and that of the}} motor case is 1. 8 mm. Since the stator transducer is fixed {{at the end of the}} cylinder, it is easy to support the <b>vibrator</b> and the structure of the motor is not complicated. In addition, the <b>vibrator</b> and rotor are supported by the glass case. This is important for the micro ultrasonic motor because it is difficult to support the <b>vibrator</b> when the <b>vibrator</b> is miniaturized. We have fabricated and evaluated the cylindrical shaped traveling type micro ultrasonic motor using this <b>vibrator.</b> </p...|$|R
5000|$|The power plot {{is useful}} in both {{positioning}} and orienting the <b>vibrator,</b> and when adjusting the <b>vibrator</b> unbalance. Poor or inappropriate <b>vibrator</b> locations or orientations, or excessive <b>vibrator</b> unbalance settings, cause large peaks in the power plot. Use of higher-powered <b>vibrator</b> motors (above 2-kW) provides more [...] "head-room" [...] for peaks in power to be tolerated, and treatment to take place, which was the case here: The power peak at ≈ 3700-RPM was {{only half of the}} <b>vibrator</b> motor’s 2.3-kW power capacity (top of the power scale).|$|R
50|$|The {{level of}} vaginal {{penetration}} when using a G-spot <b>vibrator</b> {{depends on the}} woman because women's physiology {{is not always the}} same. The effects of G-spot stimulation when using the penis or a G-spot <b>vibrator</b> may be enhanced by additionally stimulating other erogenous zones on a woman's body, such as the clitoris or vulva as a whole. When using a G-spot <b>vibrator,</b> this may be done by manually stimulating the clitoris, using the <b>vibrator</b> as a clitoral <b>vibrator</b> in addition to a G-spot <b>vibrator,</b> or, if the <b>vibrator</b> is designed for it, by applying it so that it stimulates the head of the clitoris, rest of the vulva and the vagina simultaneously.|$|R
5|$|In 2000, the Hitachi {{company had}} a {{conflict}} with Appliance Corporation of America, the American distributor of its products including the Magic Wand. The device ceased being sold briefly in the United States. In June 2000, Hitachi reached {{a deal with the}} sex toy distributor company Vibratex located in California to sell the device in the U.S. Vibratex has continued to sell the device in the U.S. through 2014. Urologist and specialist in sexual dysfunction Jed Kaminetsky told The New York Observer in 2000 that the Magic Wand had a renowned reputation. He stated he recommended the device to female patients with difficulty achieving orgasm to use in masturbation. Kaminetsky observed that the Magic Wand provided an extremely successful manner in which to masturbate and was among the preeminent <b>vibrators</b> available.|$|E
5|$|Some new bands, such as London's Alternative TV, Edinburgh's Rezillos, and Leamington's the Shapes, {{identified}} with the scene even as they pursued more experimental music. Others of a comparatively traditional rock 'n' roll bent were also swept up by the movement: the <b>Vibrators,</b> formed as a pub rock–style act in February 1976, soon adopted a punk look and sound. A few even longer-active bands including Surrey neo-mods the Jam and pub rockers the Stranglers and Cock Sparrer also became associated with the punk rock scene. Alongside the musical roots shared with their American counterparts and the calculated confrontationalism of the early Who, the British punks also reflected the influence of glam rock and related bands such as Slade, T.Rex, and Roxy Music. One of the groups openly acknowledging that influence were the Undertones, from Derry in Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Writing for the Star Tribune, Alexis McKinnis {{recommended}} the device {{for a woman}} having difficulty achieving orgasm. She wrote that for thirty-years a multitude of females had {{found it to be}} an assured way to reach orgasm. McKinnis {{recommended the}} Magic Wand again in a subsequent column as a Valentine's Day gift, and wrote that it faced little competition due to its basic construction, efficiency, intensity, and reliability. Author Robert J. Rubel wrote that the device was among the highest-demanded <b>vibrators</b> in the United States. Rubel stated that approximately ninety-percent of females are able to achieve orgasm with the Magic Wand. A panel of users arranged by Good Housekeeping tried the Magic Wand for relief of lumbar discomfort and were unimpressed with the results. Self Magazine observed in 2010 that the device's appreciation had become a cultural phenomenon.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{designing}} {{problems of}} the <b>vibrator</b> composed by the transducer, horn and tool in the ultrasonic vibration internal grinding (UVG) system, a new whole <b>vibrator</b> design method were proposed.

The mutation is an intracisternal A particle retroposon insertion in intron 4 of the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein α gene, causing a 5 -fold reduction in RNA and protein levels. Expression of neurofilament light chain is also reduced in <b>vibrator,</b> suggesting one signaling pathway that may underlie <b>vibrator</b> pathology.

5|$|Sex {{therapist}} Ruth Westheimer {{said the}} device was most favored by those selecting from <b>vibrators</b> of the corded electrical variety. Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who had never experienced an orgasm {{and those who had}} difficulty becoming aroused. Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{new device}} for noncontact {{transportation}} of small solid objects is presented here. Ultrasonic flexural vibrations are generated along the ring shaped <b>vibrator</b> using two Langevin transducers and {{by using a}} reflector parallel to the <b>vibrator,</b> small particles are trapped at the nodal points of the resulting acoustic standing wave. The particles are then moved by generating a traveling wave along the <b>vibrator,</b> which {{can be done by}} modulating the vibration amplitude of the transducers. The working principle of the traveling wave along the <b>vibrator</b> has been modeled by the superposition of two orthogonal standing waves, and the position of the particles can be predicted by using finite element analysis of the <b>vibrator</b> and the resulting acoustic field. A prototype consisting of a 3 mm thick, 220 mm long, 50 mm wide and 52 mm radius aluminum ring-type <b>vibrator</b> and a reflector of the same length and width was built and small polystyrene spheres have been successfully transported along the straight parts of the <b>vibrator...</b>|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure  8, when the <b>vibrator</b> {{is working in}} low frequencies, with the {{increase}} of driving frequency, both the piezoelectric pump’s flow rate and <b>vibrator</b> amplitude present to increase at first then decrease. When the driving frequency is 4  Hz, the piezoelectric <b>vibrator</b> has its maximum amplitude of 165.8  μm; when the driving frequency is 5  Hz, the piezoelectric pump has its maximum flow rate of 6.6  g/min. The reason for the driving frequency at maximum <b>vibrator</b> amplitude being different from that at maximum flow rate is that the flow rate of the piezoelectric pump depends on the volume change in pump chamber per unit time, that is, the flow rate is associated with <b>vibrator</b> amplitude and the driving frequency, therefore, the <b>vibrator</b> amplitude can’t completely determine the flow rate.|$|R
25|$|Before about 1905 when tube type {{rectifiers}} were developed, {{power conversion}} devices were purely electro-mechanical in design.

25|$|Masturbation is {{the sexual}} {{stimulation}} of one's own genitals for sexual arousal or other sexual pleasure, usually {{to the point}} of orgasm. The stimulation may involve hands, fingers, everyday objects, sex toys such as <b>vibrators,</b> or combinations of these. Mutual masturbation (mutual manual stimulation of the genitals between partners) can be a substitute for sexual penetration. Studies have found that masturbation is frequent in humans of both sexes and all ages, although there is variation. Various medical and psychological benefits have been attributed to a healthy attitude toward sexual activity in general and to masturbation in particular. No causal relationship is known between masturbation and any form of mental or physical disorder.|$|E
