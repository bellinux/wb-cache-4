50|$|Fresnel lenses {{are usually}} {{made of glass}} or plastic; their size varies from large (old {{historical}} lighthouses, meter size) to medium (book-reading aids, OHP <b>viewgraph</b> projectors) to small (TLR/SLR camera screens, micro-optics). In many cases they are very thin and flat, almost flexible, with thicknesses in the 1 to 5 mm range.|$|E
50|$|A transparency, {{also known}} {{variously}} as a viewfoil, foil, or <b>viewgraph,</b> {{is a thin}} sheet of transparent flexible material, typically cellulose acetate, onto which figures can be drawn. These are then placed on an overhead projector for display to an audience. Many companies and small organizations use a system of projectors and transparencies in meetings and other groupings of people, though this system is being largely replaced by video projectors and interactive whiteboards.|$|E
5000|$|Vugraph (or <b>Viewgraph)</b> is {{a method}} of {{displaying}} the bidding and play of bridge hands on a screen for viewing by an audience. [...] The basis of the current computer-generated display was originally developed by Fred Gitelman for the American Contract Bridge League in 1991 under {{a grant from the}} estate of Peter Pender, a champion player. Then known as PenderGraph, the software program was first used at the 1991 Summer North American Bridge Championships at Las Vegas. The program was substantially revised in 1993 to work under the Microsoft Windows operating system. Archived Vugraph data can be found from various databases and the most complete collection of bridge data is the Vugraph Project.|$|E

40|$|A Histogram is a {{vertical}} bar chart that depicts {{the distribution of}} a set of data. Unlike Run Charts or Control Charts, which are discussed in other modules, a Histogram does not reflect process performance over time. It's helpful to think of a Histogram as being like a snapshot, while a Run Chart or Control Chart is more like a movie (<b>Viewgraph</b> 1). When should we use a Histogram? When you are unsure what to do with a large set of measurements presented in a table, you can use a Histogram to organize and display the data in a more userfriendly format. A Histogram will make it easy to see where the majority of values falls in a measurement scale, and how much variation there is. It is helpful to construct a Histogram when you want to do the following (<b>Viewgraph</b> 2) :! Summarize large data sets graphically. When you look at <b>Viewgraph</b> 6, you can see that a set of data presented in a table isnâ€™t easy to use. You can make it much easier to understand by summarizing it on a tally sheet (<b>Viewgraph</b> 7) and organizing it into a Histogram (<b>Viewgraph</b> 12). ! Compare process results with specification limits. If you add the process specification limits to your Histogram, you can determine quickl...|$|E

40|$|In October-November 2000, I gave {{a series}} of talks, {{describing}} in some detail the algorithms in two general-purpose solvers: (1) the PVODE solver for systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and (2) the IDA solver for systems of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs).

40|$|One of {{the active}} areas of {{computational}} aeroacoustics is {{the application of the}} Kirchhoff formulas to the problems of the rotating machinery noise prediction. The original Kirchhoff formula was derived for a stationary surface. In 1988, Farassat and Myers derived a Kirchhoff Formula obtained originally by Morgans using modern mathematics. These authors gave a formula particularly useful for applications in aeroacoustics. This formula is for a surface moving at subsonic speed. Later in 1995 these authors derived the Kirchhoff formula for a supersonically moving surface. This technical memorandum presents the <b>viewgraphs</b> of a day long workshop by the author on the derivation of the Kirchhoff formulas. All necessary background mathematics such as differential geometry and multidimensional generalized function theory are discussed in these <b>viewgraphs.</b> Abstraction is kept at minimum level here.
