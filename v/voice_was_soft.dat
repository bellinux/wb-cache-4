She {{was said to}} have had a soft face with strong features—a classic beauty contrasting with the king's preference for [...] "sultry" [...] women. Her personal speaking <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> <b>soft</b> and warm, but when conducting affairs of the state, she asserted her points with strength.

5000|$|Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge later {{also joined}} the group. Every member sings vocals, with Jughead {{handling}} the bass voice {{on a few}} tracks.

60|$|Having spoken so, gloatingly, evilly, he {{sank back}} again, and {{composed}} himself. It {{was as if}} a curtain fell. All emotion passed again from his pale face.

6000|$|Mr. Clinch looked hastily up. Leaning on the parapet of what {{appeared}} to be a garden on the roof of the house was a young girl, red-cheeked, bright-eyed, blond-haired. The <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> <b>soft,</b> subdued, and mellow; it was part of the new impression he was receiving, that it seemed to be in some sort connected with the ivy-clad wall before him. His hat was in his hand as he answered,-- ...|$|E

60|$|McCay sucked {{his cigar}} {{in silence for}} a while, {{watching}} with dreamy eyes the blue smoke as it curled ceiling-ward. When he spoke his <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> singularly <b>soft.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] {{interrupted}} Clement harshly. [...] "I'm {{not going}} to have any words with you. If I had seen fit not to tell you of this how much would you have known of it?
