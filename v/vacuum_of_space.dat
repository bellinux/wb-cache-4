5|$|Unlike {{most other}} science fiction shows, which add sound to space scenes for {{dramatic}} effect, Firefly portrays space as silent, because sounds cannot be transmitted in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
5|$|The deep <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> {{could make}} it an {{attractive}} environment for certain industrial processes, {{such as those that}} require ultraclean surfaces. However, like asteroid mining, space manufacturing requires a significant investment with little prospect of an immediate return. An important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: $– per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate. Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include non-rocket spacelaunch, momentum exchange tethers, and space elevators.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} scenes is {{heightened}} by alternating between objective and subjective perspectives, the warm {{face of the}} Earth and the depths of dark space, the chaos and unpredictability of the debris field, and silence in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> with the background score giving the desired effect. The film uses very long, uninterrupted shots throughout to draw the audience into the action, but contrasts these with claustrophobic shots within space suits and capsules.|$|E
25|$|Under certain test conditions, {{microbes}} {{have been}} observed to thrive in the near-weightlessness <b>of</b> <b>space</b> and {{to survive in the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>space.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{absence of}} {{diffusing}} atmospheric {{effects in the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>space</b> produces shadows that are stark and sharply delineated by high-contrast boundaries between high and dark.|$|R
50|$|Space debris {{describes}} particulates in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>space,</b> {{and specifically}} refers to particles originating with human activity that remain in geocentric {{orbit around the}} Earth.|$|R
5|$|Chell and GLaDOS {{return to}} the modern {{chambers}} and face Wheatley, who is driven by GLaDOS's software to test them against a series of traps, which Chell escapes. In their final confrontation, Chell attaches three corrupted personality cores (Nolan North) to Wheatley, allowing a second core transfer to restore GLaDOS to control. However, Wheatley blows up the button needed to activate the transfer. With the facility exploding around them due to the impending meltdown of its reactor core, the roof collapses revealing the night sky, whereupon Chell places a portal on the moon overhead. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> pulls her and Wheatley through the other portal still inside the chamber, and GLaDOS reasserts her control. GLaDOS retrieves Chell, who falls unconscious, and Wheatley is left in space with a corrupt personality core orbiting him.|$|E
25|$|The {{environment}} of space is lethal without appropriate protection: {{the greatest threat}} in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> derives {{from the lack of}} oxygen and pressure, although temperature and radiation also pose risks.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{sublimation}} {{into the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space,</b> {{the temperature in}} the permanently shadowed region is so low that this sublimation is slow enough to potentially preserve deposited ice for billions of years.|$|E
25|$|Superboy wears a Legion flight ring {{to signify}} his {{membership}} in the Legion of Super-Heroes, and for its communication function (allowing him to converse with other Legionnaires in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>space).</b>|$|R
5000|$|An early {{appreciation}} {{of the role of}} motion in geometry was given by Alhazen (965 to 1039). His work [...] "Space and its Nature" [...] uses comparisons of the dimensions of a mobile body to quantify the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> imaginary <b>space.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{concept is}} not limited to environments frequented by people. Almost any place in the {{universe}} will have an ambient pressure, from the hard <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> deep <b>space</b> to the interior of an exploding supernova. At extremely small scales the concept of pressure becomes irrelevant, and it is undefined at a gravitational singularity.|$|R
25|$|The {{survival}} of spores {{treated with the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space,</b> however shielded against solar radiation, is substantially increased, if they are exposed in multilayers and/or {{in the presence of}} glucose as protective.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, Kieffer et al. (2006) {{suggest that}} Enceladus' geysers {{originate}} from clathrate hydrates, where carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen are released {{when exposed to}} the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> by the fractures.|$|E
25|$|During The Daleks' Master Plan, Katarina {{is taken}} hostage by the escaped {{prisoner}} Kirksen, who {{demands that the}} Doctor take him to Kembel, a planet {{taken over by the}} Daleks. To prevent the Doctor giving in to Kirksen's demands, she chooses to trigger the controls to the airlock she is being held in, propelling both herself and her captor into the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{coaxial cable}} {{connector}} is provided, which resists radio frequency breakdown in coaxial cables used in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>space.</b> The connector body surrounds an insulator which includes an easily compressible elastomeric portion. An insulated coaxial cable is prepared so that its insulation projects beyond the outer conductor and compresses the elastomeric portion of the connector insulator...|$|R
5000|$|Solar Energy Dependency: His {{abilities}} {{will eventually}} weaken without replenishing his energy reserves with normal (yellow) sun radiation, {{especially if he}} doesn't have any direct contact with yellow sunlight. He also cannot breathe in space without a Sun in his vicinity, although he can hold his breath for several hours if not days in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>space.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lightwave's {{real name}} is Aurora Dante. Like her {{half-brother}} Bobby Drake (a.k.a. the superhero Iceman), Lightwave is a mutant. She can manipulate and control light. Her other light-based powers include laser blasts, photonic force fields and solid light pressor beams. She can also transform herself into light; in such a form, {{she is able to}} exist in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>space.</b>|$|R
25|$|Three {{series of}} {{astrobiology}} experiments {{have been conducted}} outside the International Space Station between 2008 and 2015 (EXPOSE) where {{a wide variety of}} biomolecules, microorganisms, and their spores were exposed to the solar flux and <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> for about 1.5 years. Some organisms survived in an inactive state for considerable lengths of time, and those samples sheltered by simulated meteorite material provide experimental evidence for the likelihood of the hypothetical scenario of lithopanspermia.|$|E
25|$|The sample return mission {{would be}} {{designed}} to break the chain of contact between Mars and {{the exterior of the}} sample container, for instance, by sealing the returned container inside another larger container in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> before return to Earth. In order to eliminate the risk of parachute failure, the current plan is to return the capsule to the Earth without the use of parachutes: the capsule will fall at terminal velocity and the impact will be cushioned by the capsule's thermal protection system. The sample container would {{be designed to}} withstand the force of the impact.|$|E
25|$|Endeavour {{carried a}} wide variety of {{equipment}} and cargo in the payload bay, with the largest item being the Kibo Japanese Experiment Module Exposed Facility (JEM EF), and the Kibo Japanese Experiment Logistics Module – Exposed Section (ELM-ES). The exposed facility is a part of Kibo that will allow astronauts to perform science experiments that are exposed to the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space.</b> The exposed section is similar to the logistics module on the Kibo laboratory, but is not pressurized. Once its payloads were transferred to the JEM EF, the ELM-ES was returned to the payload bay.|$|E
50|$|In aviation, {{pressure}} suits protect {{fighter pilots}} from hypoxia / altitude sickness, and g-suits from {{the adverse effects}} of acceleration (gravity-induced loss of consciousness, or G-LOC). The most extreme environmental suits are used by astronauts to protect them during ascent and while in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> space: <b>space</b> suits and space activity suits. Such suits are self-supporting, and include a supply of oxygen for the wearer.|$|R
50|$|As a constant, it {{can also}} be defined as a {{fundamental}} invariant quantity, and is also one of three components that defines free space through Maxwell's equations. In classical physics, free space is a concept of electromagnetic theory, corresponding to a theoretically perfect vacuum and sometimes referred to as the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> free <b>space,</b> or as classical vacuum, and is appropriately viewed as a reference medium.|$|R
50|$|Tardigrades live {{over the}} entire world, {{including}} the high Himalayas. Tardigrades are also able to survive temperatures of close to absolute zero (-273 C), temperatures as high as 151 C, radiation that would kill other animals, and almost a decade without water. Since 2007, tardigrades have also returned alive from studies {{in which they have}} been exposed to the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>space</b> in low earth orbit.|$|R
25|$|Human {{physiology}} {{is adapted}} to living within the atmosphere of Earth, and {{a certain amount of}} oxygen is required in the air we breathe. The minimum concentration, or partial pressure, of oxygen that can be tolerated is 16 kPa (0.16 bar). Below this, the astronaut is at risk of becoming unconscious and dying from hypoxia. In the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space,</b> gas exchange in the lungs continues as normal but results in the removal of all gases, including oxygen, from the bloodstream. After 9 to 12 seconds, the deoxygenated blood reaches the brain, and it results in the loss of consciousness. Death would gradually follow after two minutes of exposure—though the absolute limits are uncertain.|$|E
25|$|Then, data {{gathered}} by the orbital experiments ERA, BIOPAN, EXOSTACK and EXPOSE, determined that isolated spores, including those of B. subtilis, were killed by several orders of magnitude if exposed to the full space environment for a mere few seconds, but if shielded against solar UV, the spores were capable of surviving in space for up to 6 years while embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites). Though minimal protection is required to shelter a spore against UV radiation, exposure to solar UV and cosmic ionizing radiation of unprotected DNA, break it up into its bases. Also, exposing DNA to the ultrahigh <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> alone is sufficient to cause DNA damage, so the transport of unprotected DNA or RNA during interplanetary flights powered solely by light pressure is extremely unlikely. The feasibility of other means of transport for the more massive shielded spores into the outer Solar System – for example, through gravitational capture by comets – is at this time unknown.|$|E
25|$|The {{station in}} its {{complete}} form has several smaller external components, {{such as the}} six robotic arms, the three External Stowage Platforms (ESPs) and four ExPRESS Logistics Carriers (ELCs). While these platforms allow experiments (including MISSE, the STP-H3 and the Robotic Refueling Mission) to be deployed and conducted in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> by providing electricity and processing experimental data locally, their primary function is to store spare Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs). ORUs are parts that can be replaced when they fail or pass their design life. Examples of ORUs include pumps, storage tanks, antennas and battery units. Such units are replaced either by astronauts during EVA or by robotic arms. Spare parts were routinely transported {{to and from the}} station via Space Shuttle resupply missions, with a heavy emphasis on ORU transport once the NASA Shuttle approached retirement. Several shuttle missions were dedicated to the delivery of ORUs, including STS-129, STS-133 and STS-134. , only one other mode of transportation of ORUs had been utilised – the Japanese cargo vessel HTV-2 – which delivered an FHRC and CTC-2 via its Exposed Pallet (EP).|$|E
5000|$|Pressure - {{they can}} {{withstand}} the extremely low pressure <b>of</b> a <b>vacuum</b> and also very high pressures, more than 1,200 times atmospheric pressure. Tardigrades can survive the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> open <b>space</b> and solar radiation combined {{for at least}} 10 days. Some species can also withstand pressure of 6,000 atmospheres, which is nearly six times the pressure {{of water in the}} deepest ocean trench, the Mariana trench.|$|R
40|$|The {{system for}} {{measurement}} of temperature of {{solid and liquid}} samples for spectroscopic measurement {{in the range of}} 77 K - 300 K was designed. For the above mentioned system, the pump vacuum line was designed and analysed for pumping <b>of</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>spaces</b> <b>of</b> two types of liquid nitrogen cryostats used for spectroscopic measurements. The part of the solution is design of temperature sensor positions and an electrical resistance heater for the sample temperature stabilisation. Furthermore, an electrical resistance heater for heating/outgassing <b>of</b> the <b>vacuum</b> pump line was designed...|$|R
50|$|In {{classical}} electromagnetism, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> free <b>space,</b> {{or sometimes}} just free space or perfect vacuum, {{is a standard}} reference medium for electromagnetic effects. Some authors refer to this reference medium as classical vacuum, a terminology intended to separate this concept from QED vacuum or QCD vacuum, where vacuum fluctuations can produce transient virtual particle densities and a relative permittivity and relative permeability that are not identically unity.|$|R
500|$|As seen in Green Lantern (vol. 4) #25, the Guardians {{decide to}} bring {{the second of the}} new laws into effect. After realizing that the [...] "Blackest Night" [...] prophecy will come to pass, Ganthet and Sayd depart after {{creating}} a blue power ring with the intention of creating their own Corps, based on the spreading of Hope {{to the rest of the}} universe. The Anti-Monitor, having been blown across the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> at the battle's climax, finds itself on a dark planet. Here it is transformed by an unknown force into a Black Power Battery.|$|E
500|$|... where (r, θ, φ) {{correspond}} to a spherical coordinate system. This metric {{has only two}} undetermined parameters. An overall dimensionless length scale factor R describes the size scale of the Universe {{as a function of}} time; an increase in R is the expansion of the Universe. A curvature index k describes the geometry. The index k is defined {{so that it can be}} only 0, corresponding to flat Euclidean geometry, 1, corresponding to a space of positive curvature, or −1, a space of positive or negative curvature. The value of R as a function of time t depends upon k and the cosmological constant Λ. The cosmological constant represents the energy density of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> and could be related to dark energy. The equation describing how R varies with time is known as the Friedmann equation after its inventor, Alexander Friedmann.|$|E
500|$|Extremophiles are {{microorganisms}} {{that have}} adapted {{so that they}} can survive and even thrive in extreme environments that are normally fatal to most life-forms. Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles thrive in high temperatures. Psychrophiles thrive in extremely low temperatures. – Temperatures as high as , as low as [...] Halophiles thrive in high salt conditions, up to saturation. Alkaliphiles thrive in an alkaline pH of about 8.5–11. Acidophiles can thrive in a pH of 2.0 or less. Piezophiles thrive at very high pressures: up to 1,000-2,000 atm, down to 0 atm as in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space.</b> A few extremophiles such as Deinococcus radiodurans are radioresistant, resisting radiation exposure of up to 5k Gy. Extremophiles are significant in different ways. They extend terrestrial life into much of the Earth's hydrosphere, crust and atmosphere, their specific evolutionary adaptation mechanisms to their extreme environment can be exploited in biotechnology, and their very existence under such extreme conditions increases the potential for extraterrestrial life.|$|E
50|$|The {{characters}} in the series are primarily monsters and their pets (called Monsterpets). The Hugglemonsters and Denzel were able to survive without visible protection on the Monster Moon which had no apparent atmosphere, suggesting that Monsters and Monsterettes (also called monster girls) can resist the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>space</b> and, {{if they have to}} breathe or are required to hold their breath, they can hold their breath for extended periods of time.|$|R
40|$|A {{bidirectional}} reflectometer {{system was}} developed for in situ measurements {{of the changes in}} spectral reflectance of surfaces contaminated with films of organic materials. The system permits experiments with films of controlled thickness in an environment that simulates the thermal, radiation, and <b>vacuum</b> conditions <b>of</b> <b>space.</b> The mechanical and optical construction of the reflectometer are discussed in detail, and actual data curves are used to illustrate its operation and performance...|$|R
50|$|Star Wars Legends {{expanded}} universe media such as {{games and}} comics feature {{a number of}} specialized stormtrooper units.
