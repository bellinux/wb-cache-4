40|$|With the popularization of the inverter-driven air-conditioner and the {{requirement}} of comfort and energy saving, the operating frequency of inverter-driven air-conditioner is lower and lower, even to 1 Hz. But when the air-conditioner operates under the frequency of 10 Hz, a periodic sound {{will appear in the}} air-conditioner outdoor unit, which should be researched and solved. According to the experiment test and theoretical analysis, it is found that the periodic sound is the excited resonance when the <b>valve</b> <b>opens.</b> The resonator is composed by the discharge port of top-flange and discharge cavity which is made up by cylinder, roller, top-flange and bottom-flange. In one cycle the characteristic of the periodic sound is that the sound will be only taken place when the <b>valve</b> <b>opens</b> and the <b>frequency</b> of the sound will be higher and higher with the crank angle increasing. According to the experimental testing about different type compressor and air-conditioner outdoor unit, it is found that this sound exists in every kinds of rolling piston compressor. Using proper muffler and increasing the thickness of the valve could both reduce this periodic sound...|$|R

50|$|Another reason {{relates to}} the {{hydraulic}} control line. Hydraulic pressure is required to keep the <b>valve</b> <b>open</b> {{as part of the}} failsafe design. However, if the valve is too far down the well, then the weight of the hydraulic fluid alone may apply sufficient pressure to keep the <b>valve</b> <b>open,</b> even with the loss of surface pressurisation.|$|R

50|$|Chronotropic {{variables}} in systolic myocardial left and right. Left sided systolic chronotropy can be appreciated as Aortic <b>Valve</b> <b>open</b> to close time.

Inverted as diastolic chronotropy, the variables are aortic <b>valve</b> close to <b>open</b> and pulmonic close to open time.

5000|$|At point B, {{pressure}} becomes {{higher than}} the aortic pressure and the aortic <b>valve</b> <b>opens,</b> initiating ejection.|$|R

50|$|During diastole, a normally-functioning mitral <b>valve</b> <b>opens</b> as {{a result}} of {{increased}} pressure from the left atrium as it fills with blood (preloading). As atrial pressure increases above that of the left ventricle, the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>opens.</b> Opening facilitates the passive flow of blood into the left ventricle. Diastole ends with atrial contraction, which ejects the final 20% of blood that is transferred from the left atrium to the left ventricle. This amount of blood is known as end-diastolic volume, and the mitral valve closes at the end of atrial contraction to prevent a reversal of blood flow.|$|R
50|$|In {{the simple}} case, {{this can be}} a {{relatively}} simple task as in the internal combustion engine in which the <b>valves</b> always <b>open</b> and close at the same points. This is not the ideal arrangement for a steam engine, though, because greatest power is achieved by keeping the inlet <b>valve</b> <b>open</b> throughout the power stroke (thus having full boiler pressure, minus transmission losses, against the piston throughout the stroke) while peak efficiency is achieved by only having the inlet <b>valve</b> <b>open</b> for a short time and then letting the steam expand in the cylinder (expansive working).|$|R

50|$|The bleeder brake is a {{simplified}} version of traditional engine brakes. When the bleeder brake is turned on, a piston extends {{to its full}} stroke and stays there, holding the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>open</b> a small, fixed distance throughout the entire four-stroke engine cycle. Since the bleeder brake only holds the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>open</b> a fixed distance, it can be designed so that is does not put any load on the camshaft {{and most of the}} overhead components.|$|R
50|$|Other units use a non-electrical approach, {{where the}} pilot heats a {{bimetallic}} element or a gas-filled tube to exert mechanical pressure {{to keep the}} gas <b>valve</b> <b>open.</b> If the pilot fails, the valve closes. To restart the system, the valve must be held open manually and the pilot lit, and then the valve must be held open until the element heats up {{enough to hold the}} <b>valve</b> <b>open.</b> Non-electrical schemes are appropriate for systems that do not use electricity.|$|R

5000|$|Exhaust: The exhaust <b>valve</b> remains <b>open</b> {{while the}} piston moves upward {{expelling}} the combustion gases. For naturally aspirated engines {{a small part}} of the combustion gases may remain in the cylinder during normal operation because the piston does not close the combustion chamber completely; these gases dissolve in the next charge.

50|$|At lower engine speeds, the {{position}} of the camshaft is moved so the <b>valves</b> are <b>opened</b> later, as this improves idling quality and smooth power development.As the engine speed increases, the <b>valves</b> are <b>opened</b> earlier: this enhances torque, reduces fuel consumption and lowers emissions.At high engine speeds, the <b>valves</b> are <b>opened</b> later again, because this allows full power delivery.|$|R
