40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2012. Major: Physics. Advisor: E. Dan Dahlberg. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 74 pages, appendices A-B. <b>Vortex</b> <b>noise</b> in superconductors {{is due to}} the motion of quantized flux (vortices) {{across the surface of the}} superconductor. This changing magnetic flux gives rise to a voltage which we detect as a noise signal. Previous measurements show that the <b>vortex</b> <b>noise</b> is related to the interaction of the vortices with intrinsic pinning sites which limit vortex motion. These studies show that the noise signal is composed of voltage bursts related to the vortices moving in fits and starts due to the random location and strength of the intrinsic vortex pinning sites. Our samples are composed of a periodic triangular array of holes that serve as vortex pinning sites. These samples show periodic minima in resistance when the vortex/pinning site densities are commensurate. We find a <b>vortex</b> <b>noise</b> signal that is field, current and temperature dependent, arising from the vortices being depinned. We measure the <b>vortex</b> <b>noise</b> to determine if there is a change from uncorrelated vortex depinning below the first matching field where unoccupied pinning sites exist, to highly correlated vortex depinning at the first matching field when the vortexes are commensurate with the pinning lattice. Our measurements show that there is no field dependence in the <b>vortex</b> <b>noise</b> signal, indicating that the vortex depinning is correlated as the lattice is driven by a DC current. We explain this result in terms of the long range order of our pinning lattice and the strength of the vortex-vortex interaction in our 100 nm pinning lattice. Our findings suggest that the <b>vortex</b> <b>noise</b> is dominated by the vortex-vortex not vortex-pinning site interactions...|$|E

40|$|The noise {{generation}} by accelerated vorticity waves in a nozzle flow {{was investigated in}} a model experiment. This {{noise generation}} mechanism belongs, besides entropy noise, to the indirect combustion noise phenomena. Vorticity as well as entropy fluctuations, originating from the highly turbulent combustion zone, are convected with the flow and produce noise during their acceleration in the outlet nozzle of the combustion chamber. In the model experiment, noise generation of accelerated vorticity fluctuations was achieved. The vorticity fluctuations in the tube flow were produced by injecting temporally additional air into the mean flow.

40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{characteristics of}} a twin contra-rotating coaxial rotor configuration with significant flapwise stiffness are investigated in steady forward flight. The Vorticity Transport Model is used to simulate the aerodynamics of the rotor system and the acoustic field is determined using the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation implemented using the Farassat- 1 A formulation. Increasing the hub stiffness alters {{the strengths of the}} blade vortex interactions, particularly those between the upper and lower rotors, and affects the intensity and directivity of the blade <b>vortex</b> interaction <b>noise</b> produced by the system. The inter-rotor blade vortex interaction on the advancing side of the lower rotor is the principal source of the most intensively focused noise that is generated by a conventionally articulated coaxial rotor system. For stiffened coaxial rotors, this particular inter-rotor blade vortex interaction is weakened {{as a result of a}} broad redistribution in lateral loading, yielding a reduction in the intensity of the noise that is produced by this interaction. The spanwise distribution of loading on the rotors of a stiffened coaxial system can be modified further by altering the lateral partition of lift (or lift offset). It is shown that decreasing the lift offset has the effect of counteracting the redistribution of loading due to flapwise stiffness and hence increases the blade <b>vortex</b> interaction <b>noise</b> as well as the power consumed by the rotor. Conversely, a reduction in both the power consumption and the blade <b>vortex</b> interaction <b>noise</b> is observed if the lift offset is increased, with the maximum benefit of lift offset being achieved at high speed. The computational results suggest that the noise from the dominant inter-rotor blade vortex interaction can be ameliorated through the use of lift offset control on stiffened coaxial systems, to the extent that the noise produced by this interaction can be made to be comparable to that produced by the other, weaker interactions between the two rotors of the syste...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results {{on the use of}} porous metal foams (passive control) and dielectric barrier surface plasma actuations (active control) for the reduction of <b>vortex</b> shedding tonal <b>noises</b> from the nonflat plate type trailing edge serration in a NACA 0012 airfoil previously discussed in Chong et al. (AIAA J. Vol. 51, 2013, pp. 2665 - 2677). The use of porous metal foams to fill the interstices between adjacent members of the sawtooth can almost completely suppress the <b>vortex</b> shedding tonal <b>noise,</b> whilst the serration effect on the broadband noise reduction is retained. This concept will promote the nonflat plate type serrated trailing edge to become a genuine alternative to the conventional flat plate type serrated trailing edge, which is known to have drawbacks in the structural stability, aerodynamic performances and implementation issues. For the plasma actuators, configuration which produces electric wind in a tangential direction is found to be not very effective in suppressing the vortices emanated from the serration blunt root. On the other hand, for the plasma configuration which produces electric wind in a vertical direction, good level of <b>vortex</b> shedding tonal <b>noise</b> reduction has been demonstrated. However, the self noise produced by the plasma actuators negates the noise benefits on the tonal nois...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the physical mechanisms associated with tip <b>vortex</b> <b>noise</b> caused by rotating wind turbines with giant size of computational fluid dynamics. The flow and acoustic field around the WINDMELIII wind turbine is simulated using compressible Large-Eddy simulation (LES), with emphasis on the blade tip region.

The results show that, with the decrease of valve opening, the amplitude of full pressure and flow fluctuations tends to be larger and the stall frequency remains the same.

The influence of the internal flow on the aerodynamic noise is discussed with taking account of the axial direction relative position. In this experiment, when the relative position is 20 mm, the periodical noise at 200 Hz which is the low frequency side than that of the blade passing frequency became large. The periodical noise became the one of the important factors for increasing the fan noise by 5 dB.

Rotors with cylindrical blades generally created more noise throughout the noise spectrum than the rotor with NACA 0012 blades. Blowing the shed wake from the rotor with cylindrical blades did not have an appreciable effect on the frequency-amplitude spectrum.

40|$|Real {{challenges}} to suppress undesirable fluid-excited acoustics are posed {{by a wide}} variety of engineering disciplines. Noise regulations, passenger comfort and component stability are motivators which are continuing to stimulate substantial efforts towards the understanding of aeroacoustic phenomena, and not least to quantify the usability (practicability and value) of traditional and advanced prediction methods. The latter is the primary focus of this thesis, particularly as applied to the transportation industries, aerospace, automotive and rail. Nowadays Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a tool well integrated into the industrial development and production life-cycles. This is possible now because of two main factors: the increase in the performance of relatively cheap personal computers and network facilities, and the progress made in general purpose CFD software between modeling complexity and practicability within the industrial environment. While CFD methodologies are well established for lots of applications such as aerodynamics, heat exchange, etc., aeroacoustic CFD simulations still represent a challenge, in particular their industrial practicability. In these years this has given rise to heavy investments by the automotive industry in international aeroacoustics consortia, whereby all the major car companies work together to study the limitations and advantages of aeroacoustics CFD. The general aim of these consortia is to develop methodologies which fit into, and improve upon, current design processes. The goal of the present work is to explore the multitude of different CFD modeling approaches for some typical industrial problems such as: cavity <b>noise,</b> <b>vortex</b> shedding <b>noise,</b> propeller and jet noise. Each of these problems has a particular mechanism for noise generation and different methods have been studied and tested, in order to develop and optimize a practical methodology for the analysis of each problem type. Furthermore each of the aeroacoustics problems considered are representative of a variety of industrial applications. Cavity noise is at the origin of phenomena such as sun-roof buffeting in convertibles or door-gap tonal <b>noise.</b> <b>Vortex</b> shedding <b>noise</b> is typical of any flows involving bluff bodies such as automobile antennas or aircraft landing gear. Propeller noise is typical to applications involving rotating machinery, such as fans, pumps and turbines. Different approaches ranging from steady and transient RANS simulations with the acoustic analogy (including porous and solid surface formulations), to Computational Aero Acoustics (CAA) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) type computations have been studied and applied. Classic theories already exist to predict aerodynamically generated noise, which are both computationally and economically less expensive than CFD methods. However aeroacoustics CFD is the future, beginning as a promising present, for the following reasons: 	Industries are interested in modeling complex geometries. 	Many classic theories can be applied successfully but very often restrictions exist with respect to the configuration and flow conditions. For example, classic propeller theories cannot be used to model real-world configurations such as a propeller installed on a wing with some prescribed yaw or angle of attack. 	The progress of all other Computer Aided Design and Engineering tools, such as linear or non-linear structural codes, are driving design towards a virtual multi-physics approach for the simulation of complex geometries. Due to previous experience and the wide availability of modeling options, it was decided to use the general purpose CFD software package ANSYS FLUENT for CFD investigations in this study...|$|R
