5|$|The {{residents}} of urban areasin particular Antananarivohave been {{hardest hit by}} economic downturns and economic policy shifts. The national economic crisis in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and the World Bank's imposition of a structural adjustment program lowered living standards for the average resident of the city. The end of state subsidies, rapid inflation, higher taxes, widespread impoverishment {{and the decline of}} the middle class were especially evident in Antananarivo, as was the growing wealth of a tiny political and economic elite in the city. In 2007, two thirds of Antananarivo residents had access to electricity, while ten percent of households owned a scooter, car or other motor <b>vehicle.</b> <b>Running</b> water was installed in fewer than 25 percent of homes, small restaurants and businesses in 2007, necessitating the collection of water from household wells or neighborhood pumps and the use of outdoor pit toilets detached from the main building. In 2007, 60 percent of households were using shared public latrines. Most homes use charcoal for daily cooking; stocks of charcoal and rice are kept in the kitchen. The average city household spends just under half of its budget on food. Owing to its increasingly high cost, consumption of meat by city residents has sharply declined since the 1970s; the urban poor eat meat on holidays only once or twice a year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For {{the safety}} problem of heavy duty <b>vehicles</b> <b>running</b> on long {{downhill}} sections, a model {{was built for}} the application of engine brake and service brake combination based on test results. And a model of brake temperature rise for heavy duty <b>vehicles</b> <b>running</b> on long downhill sections was also established. For different braking modes, gear positions, speed and downhill slopes, brake temperature rising to 250 â„ƒ was used as the index. And then simulation of brake temperature rise and downhill distance was researched. Simulation results show that the combined braking of low gear and high speed should be adopted for heavy duty <b>vehicles</b> <b>running</b> on long downhill sections...|$|R

25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of traditional track structures is the heavy demand for maintenance, particularly surfacing (tamping) and lining {{to restore the}} desired track geometry and smoothness of <b>vehicle</b> <b>running.</b> Weakness of the subgrade and drainage deficiencies also lead to heavy maintenance costs. This can be overcome by using ballastless track. In its simplest form this consists of a continuous slab of concrete (like a highway structure) with the rails supported directly on its upper surface (using a resilient pad).|$|E

25|$|Average load factor, {{in transit}} systems, is {{the ratio of}} the total number of riders to the total {{theoretical}} capacity. A transit <b>vehicle</b> <b>running</b> at full capacity has a 100% load factor, while an empty vehicle has 0% load factor. If a transit vehicle spends half the time running at 100% and half the time running at 0%, the average load factor is 50%. Higher average load factor corresponds to lower energy consumption per passenger, so designers attempt to maximize this metric.|$|E

500|$|Before inauguration, GMPTE's {{original}} {{concept was}} for Metrolink's operator {{to provide a}} service every ten minutes from Bury-to-Piccadilly and Altrincham-to-Piccadilly , Monday to Saturday. Greater Manchester Metro Limited, the system's original operator, argued for adjustments, citing {{the need to provide}} an efficient and commercially viable operation in line with <b>vehicle</b> <b>running</b> times and passenger demand. Due to power limitations, this pattern was modified to a twelve-minute service throughout the day, doubling to a six-minute service in peak periods, resulting in a [...] "ten trams per hour" [...] service pattern on routes running from Altrincham and Bury to Manchester every six minutes. Operators are required to provide this level of service at least 98% of the time, or incur a financial penalty charge. This six-minute service pattern has been adopted {{on the rest of the}} network as the system has grown. Heavy snowfall during the winter of 2009/10 impaired Metrolink services and the operator was criticised for failing to have cold weather procedures. This prompted a programme to improve reliability and performance of the system in freezing conditions. Metrolink operated icebreaker-style vehicles at night during snowfall in January 2013 to provide normal services.|$|E
2500|$|Streetcar is an American word {{derived from}} [...] "street" [...] + [...] "car", where [...] "car" [...] {{is used in}} the sense of a <b>vehicle</b> <b>running</b> on rails, i.e. railway car. The first American streetcars, {{introduced}} around 1830, were horsecars, and this type of streetcar became ubiquitous because very few of the streets in American cities were paved. Mechanical versions, pulled by cables, were introduced around 1870. Electric streetcars were introduced in the 1880s and soon replaced the horse-drawn streetcar in cities across the United States.|$|E

2500|$|In its inaugural model year, three Concord {{models were}} available: Base, Sport, and the {{top-line}} D/L in four body styles. The AMX version was available {{only on the}} liftback. The D/L featured many of the luxury cues that were popular on cars in the 1970s; a [...] "landau" [...] vinyl roof with opera windows (coupe only), color-keyed wheel covers, reclining seats covered in velveteen cloth, and woodgrain instrument panel overlays. The D/L wagon featured exterior woodgrain trim and reclining seats in a leather-like perforated vinyl. The Sport package included slot-style road wheels and bodyside tape stripes on {{the lower half of}} the <b>vehicle,</b> <b>running</b> up around the wheel flares. Options included cruise control and air conditioning; however, power windows and power door locks were not available. The base model Concords retained the previous Hornet's two-door and four-door sedan rooflines, but incorporated the new front and rear end styling, as well as the other mechanical improvements.|$|E

2500|$|While {{there are}} {{different}} types of fuel that may power cars, most rely on gasoline or diesel. The United States Environmental Protection Agency states that the average vehicle emits 8,887 grams of carbon dioxide per gallon of gasoline. The average <b>vehicle</b> <b>running</b> on diesel fuel will emit 10,180 grams of carbon dioxide. Many governments are using fiscal policies (such as road tax or the US gas guzzler tax) to influence vehicle purchase decisions, with a low [...] figure often resulting in reduced taxation. Fuel taxes may act as an incentive {{for the production of}} more efficient, hence less polluting, car designs (e.g. hybrid vehicles) and the development of alternative fuels. High fuel taxes may provide a strong incentive for consumers to purchase lighter, smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, or to not drive. On average, today's cars are about 75 percent recyclable, and using recycled steel helps reduce energy use and pollution. In the United States Congress, federally mandated fuel efficiency standards have been debated regularly, passenger car standards have not risen above the [...] standard set in 1985. Light truck standards have changed more frequently, and were set at [...] in 2007.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was built}} all of timber, with the piles being driven {{straight}} into the sea bed; it was [...] "considered {{at the time the}} best specimen of pile-driving", and described as a [...] "pier and breakwater". There was curved stone balustrading at the entrance, taken from old London Bridge which was demolished in 1831. [...] A sail trolley <b>vehicle</b> <b>running</b> on tracks, powered by sail and foot and nicknamed Neptune's Car, ran the length of the pier from 13 June 1833, carrying passengers and baggage. When wind was inadequate as commonly happened, pier employees physically pushed the trolley. The pier's length was defined by the one-fathom draught of the paddle steamers and the shallow two-fathom depth of the sea even three quarters of a mile offshore at high tide. It was followed in 1861 by the railway station, and thus began the town's growth into a holiday resort. However, because the wooden piles were never protected by copper sheathing they suffered from shipworm. By 1850, many piles had been replaced with iron ones, or with wooden ones [...] "prepared by Mr Payne's process" [...] against shipworm, but as a whole they showed irreversible deterioration from 1860 onwards. Pier dues were considered expensive at 1s 6d. Subsequently, the first Herne Bay Pier Company failed due to competition between paddle steamers and the new railway which was opened on 13 July 1861, because previously most visitors arrived by steamer, then they all arrived by rail. The first pier was taken down in 1870 to 1871, long after the paddle steamers stopped coming in 1862.|$|E
