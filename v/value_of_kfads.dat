40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} evidence {{propagation operations}} on influence diagrams and a concept <b>of</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> evidence, which measures the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> experimentation. Evidence propagation operations {{are critical for}} the computation <b>of</b> the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> evidence, general update and inference operations in normative expert systems {{which are based on}} the influence diagram (generalized Bayesian network) paradigm. The <b>value</b> <b>of</b> evidence allows us to compute directly an outcome sensitivity, a <b>value</b> <b>of</b> perfect information and a <b>value</b> <b>of</b> control which are used in decision analysis (the science of decision making under uncertainty). More specifically, the outcome sensitivity is the maximum difference among the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> evidence, the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> perfect information is the expected <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> evidence, and the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> control is the optimal <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> evidence.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{argue that}} the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> {{authenticity}} does not explain the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> self-knowledge. There are a plurality of species of authenticity; {{in this paper we}} consider four species: avoiding pretense (§ 2), Frankfurtian wholeheartedness (§ 3), existential self-knowledge (§ 4), and spontaneity (§ 4). Our thesis is that, for each of these species, the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> (that species of) authenticity does not (partially) explain the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> self-knowledge. Moreover, when it comes to spontaneity, the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> (that species of) authenticity conflicts with the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> self-knowledge. A contemporary slogan, a favorite of self-help gurus, enjoins you to “be yourself,” implying the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> authenticity. The Delphic motto, a favorite of philosophers, enjoins you to “know thyself, ” implying the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> self-knowledge. What is the relationship between the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> authenticity and the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> self-knowledge? Can the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> one explain the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the other? “Authenticity ” is ambiguous in a variety of ways: representations are said to be authentic when they are accurate, cuisines are said to be authentic when they resemble some paradigm, and people are said to be authentic when they are “true to themselves. ” It is this personal sense of “authentic ” with which we are concerned here.
