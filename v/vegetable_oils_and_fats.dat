30|$|Meat trade {{liberalization}} {{is expected to}} have different impacts on exports and imports. The study addresses the export and import changes under the BAU and different trade agreement scenarios. In the CAM 2030 scenario compared with the BAU 2030 scenario, export increases for most agricultural sectors, such as the grain, vegetables and fruits, sugar, plant-based fibers, milk, wool, <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> <b>fats,</b> and the dairy product sectors. For imports, the impacts on each agricultural sector are different. For instance, grains, vegetables and fruits, and the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> <b>fats</b> sectors are expected to decrease their imports. Compared with the BAU 2030 scenario, imports of rice, wheat, and other grains are likely to decrease by 3, 2.9, and 1.6 %, respectively. Imports of vegetables and fruits are estimated to decrease by 2.4 %, while import of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> <b>fats</b> is likely to decline by 1.8 %. The reason {{is similar to that of}} the results for the MTR scenarios. For oilseeds, other crops, and other meat products, both exports and imports are expected to be higher than they are in the BAU 2030 scenario, but exports are estimated to grow faster than imports. For the other meat sectors, including beef animal sectors, other animal sectors, and other meat sectors, the import growth is higher than export growth in the CAM 2030 scenario. Overall, China’s tariff reduction for Australian and New Zealand meat products could expand China’s agricultural exports.|$|E
