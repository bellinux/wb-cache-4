Standardization of approved materials and methods in the industry have encouraged manufacturers to develop materials and machinery for its use, and these, in turn, have enabled it to meet the increasing and changing needs of libraries with a uniform product of high quality and an economical and constantly improving service. The librarian, as custodian of the library's materials, must be the originator of the binding program and {{is the only one who}} knows the end use of each item, which is usually the factor that determines the selection of the most suitable binding...|$|E

As funds are reduced, targets of opportunity are shifting from the battlefield to the appropriation field. Dollars invested in inventories are a prime target of cost reduction. This thesis examines existing inventory management policies at the Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Newport News, VA(SUPSHIPNN). It provides a decision support system, called the DSS Strategy model. The results of simulation indicate that inventory managers at SUPSHIPNN can use the DSS Strategy model to make decisions that will reduce inventories and meet production target dates. Successful management of inventories in not a cost saving measure alone. The judicious use of <b>valuable</b> <b>inventory</b> and associated resources will maintain the fleet in the highest possible state of readiness within constricting fiscal resources.

40|$|Proteomic {{profiling}} of {{the mouse}} spermatozoon has generated a unique and <b>valuable</b> <b>inventory</b> of candidates that can be mined for potential contraceptive targets and to further {{our understanding of the}} PTMs that regulate the functionality of this highly specialized cell. Here we report the identification of 858 proteins derived from mouse spermatozoa, 23 of which demonstrated testis only expression. The list contained many proteins that are known constituents of murine spermatozoa including Izumo, Spaca 1, 3, and 5, Spam 1, Zonadhesin, Spesp 1, Smcp, Spata 6, 18, and 19, Zp 3 r, Zpbp 1 and 2, Spa 17, Spag 6, 16, and 17, CatSper 4, Acr, Cylc 2, Odf 1 and 2, Acrbp, and Acrv 1. Certain protein families were highly represented in the proteome. For example, of the 42 gene products classified as proteases, 26 belonged to the 26 S-proteasome. Of the many chaperones identified in this proteome, eight proteins with a TCP- 1 domain were found, as were seven Rab guanosine triphosphatases. Finally, our list yielded three putative seven-transmembrane proteins, two of which have no known tissue distribution, an extragenomic progesterone receptor and three unique testis-specific kinases all of which may have some potential in the future regulation of male fertility...|$|E

25|$|When {{the first}} churches were {{established}} in Jämtland during the medieval period they were done so by {{a small number of}} farmers. Estimations show that there were seldom more than 30 to 40 farmers in each parish. In some cases, like in Kyrkås, Marby and Norderö parish the farmers were probably 20 or less. These original parishioners built churches that's lasted for centuries, many are still existing and functioning today. This is quite remarkable given that they built these churches in stones, much larger than their ordinary timber houses and in a material the parishioners were not accustomed to (given that they only used timber). The churches became a matter of concern for every parishioner, the centre in each parish. Everybody had to help build them and their descendants had to maintain them, this carried on for generations. Families have decorated the churches throughout history with various ornaments and art such as <b>valuable</b> <b>inventories,</b> wood carvings, paintings (predominantly biblical illustrations), textiles, silver and tin along with various handicrafts. Almost the entire older popular culture in Jämtland is tied to the churches. Making them the core of Jämtland's cultural heritage.|$|R

40|$|Mammalian {{spermatogenesis}} {{consists of}} many cell types and biological processes {{and serves as}} an excellent model for studying gene regulation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Many key proteins, miRNAs, and perhaps piRNAs {{have been shown to}} be involved in post-transcriptional regulation of spermatogenesis. How-ever, a systematic method for assessing the relationship between protein and mRNA expression has not been available for studying mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation. In the present study, we used the iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic approach to identify 2008 proteins in mouse type A spermatogonia, pachytene sper-matocytes, round spermatids, and elongative spermatids with high confidence. Of these proteins, 1194 made up four dynamically changing clusters, which reflect the mi-totic amplification, meiosis, and post-meiotic develop-ment of germ cells. We identified five major regulatory mechanisms termed “transcript only, ” “transcript degra-dation, ” “translation repression, ” “translation de-repres-sion, ” and “protein degradation ” based on changes in protein level relative to changes in mRNA level at the mitosis/meiosis transition and the meiosis/post-meiotic development transition. We found that post-transcrip-tional regulatory mechanisms are related to the genera-tion of piRNAs and antisense transcripts. Our results pro-vide a <b>valuable</b> <b>inventory</b> of proteins produced during mouse spermatogenesis and contribute to elucidating the mechanisms of the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in mammalian spermatogenesis.

40|$|Virus {{particles}} (virions) often contain {{not only}} virus-encoded but also host-encoded proteins. Some of these host proteins are enclosed within the virion structure, while others, {{in the case}} of enveloped viruses, are embedded in the host-derived membrane. While many of these host protein incorporations are likely accidental, some {{may play a role in}} virus infectivity, replication and/or immunoreactivity in the next host. Host protein incorporations may be especially important in therapeutic applications where large numbers of virus particles are administered. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is the prototypic rhabdovirus and a candidate vaccine, gene therapy and oncolytic vector. Using mass spectrometry, we previously examined cell type dependent host protein content of VSV virions using intact ("whole") virions purified from three cell lines originating from different species. Here we aimed to determine the localization of host proteins within the VSV virions by analyzing: i) whole VSV virions; and ii) whole VSV virions treated with Proteinase K to remove all proteins outside the viral envelope. A total of 257 proteins were identified, with 181 identified in whole virions and 183 identified in Proteinase K treated virions. Most of these proteins have not been previously shown to be associated with VSV. Functional enrichment analysis indicated the most overrepresented categories were proteins associated with vesicles, vesicle-mediated transport and protein localization. Using western blotting, the presence of several host proteins, including some not previously shown in association with VSV (such as Yes 1, Prl 1 and Ddx 3 y), was confirmed and their relative quantities in various virion fractions determined. Our study provides a <b>valuable</b> <b>inventory</b> of virion-associated host proteins for further investigation of their roles in the replication cycle, pathogenesis and immunoreactivity of VSV...|$|E

We tested zeolite molecular sieve cartridges, in both field and laboratory experiments, for passively collecting atmospheric CO 2. Cartridges {{were exposed to the}} free atmosphere in two configurations which controlled CO 2 trapping rate, allowing collection of sufficient CO 2 in between 1. 5 and 10 months at current levels. 14 C results for passive samples were within measurement uncertainty of samples collected using a pump-based system, showing that the method collected samples with 14 C contents representative of the atmosphere. δ 13 C analysis confirmed that the cartridges collected representative CO 2 samples, however, fractionation during passive trapping means that δ 13 C values need to be adjusted by an amount which we have quantified. Trapping rate was proportional to atmospheric CO 2 concentration, and was not affected by exposure time unless this exceeded a threshold. Passive sampling using molecular sieve cartridges provides an easy and reliable method to collect atmospheric CO 2 for 14 C analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the pellets of Long-eared Owls from 2 sites in the area of Dicle University Campus, located in the north-eastern part of DiyarbakÝr Province, Turkey (lat 37 ¡ 55 ÕN, long 40 ¡ 12 ÕE). Pellets were collected at monthly intervals from July 2000 to June 2001 and the remains of 310 prey items were recovered from 211 pellets. The assemblages were composed mostly of small mammals. Eight species of mammals belonging to 2 orders (Insectivora: Crocidura suaveolens, and Rodentia: Microtus guentheri, Microtus sp., Mus musculus, Meriones tristrami, Cricetus cricetus, Rattus rattus, and Nannospalax ehrenbergi) were identified from the Long-eared Owl pellets. Rodentia were found to be dominant, which accounted for 95. 48 % of the identified remains. The {{most important part of the}} OwlÕs food consisted of mammals, especially Microtines. Microtus guentheri was of particular importance, representing 71. 29 % of the remains found in the pellets. Living samples of the Crocidura species could not been trapped or observed in this area, but this study shows that the analysis of regurgitated pellets of Long-eared Owls is a <b>valuable</b> tool for <b>inventorying</b> small mammals...|$|R
40|$|This article uses three recent multi-district litigations (MDLs) that {{produced}} massive settlements [...] Guidant ($ 240 million), Vioxx ($ 4. 85 billion), and Zyprexa ($ 700 million) [...] {{to study the}} emerging quasi-class action approach to MDL management. The approach has four components: (1) judicial selection of lead attorneys; (2) judicial control of lead attorneys’ compensation; (3) forced fee transfers from non-lead lawyers to cover lead attorneys’ fees; and (4) judicial reduction of non-lead lawyers’ fees to save claimants money. These widely used procedures have serious downsides. They make lawyers financially dependent on judges and, therefore, loyal to judges rather than clients. They compromise judges’ independence by involving them heavily on the plaintiffs’ side and making them responsible for plaintiffs’ success. They allocate monies in ways that likely over-compensate some attorneys and under-pay others, with predictable impacts on service levels. They also lack needed grounding in substantive law because the common fund doctrine, which supports fee awards in class actions, does not apply in MDLs. Academics have not previously noted these shortcomings; {{this is the first}} scholarly assessment of the quasi-class action approach. This article also proposes an alternative method of MDL management. It recommends the creation a plaintiffs’ management committee (PMC) composed of the attorney or attorney-group with the most <b>valuable</b> client <b>inventory,</b> as determined objectively by the trial judge. The PMC, which would have a large interest in the success of an MDL, would then select and retain other lawyers to perform common benefit work (CBW) for all claimants and monitor the lawyers’ performance. The new approach would thus use micro-incentives to organize the production of CBW in MDLs rather than judicial control and oversight. The court would stand back from the process, exercising only a limited backup authority to prevent abuses. If enacted as a statute, the proposal would restore judges’ independence, preserve lawyers’ loyalties, provide the requisite legal foundation for fee awards, and encourage the fairer, more efficient, and more appropriate representation of claimants in MDLs...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Infertility and {{depression}} are major problems of today's societies. Although depression {{is one of}} the most prevalent diseases in primary care practice, consult for receiving help is carried out much less than true prevalence of the disease. Therefore gathering information about prevalence and risk factors of depression is very <b>valuable.</b> Beck Depression <b>Inventory</b> (BDI) which is a screening tool for depression can be used in Iranian patients because of availability of a validated translation. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of depression in infertile subjects in an infertility center. Materials and Methods: In this study, 681 infertile women were evaluated in Shariati Hospital, Tehran. Demographic information’s including age, duration, type and cause of infertility, level of education, previous treatments and smoking habits were recorded. BDI was completed by patients and score was estimated. Score of 16 and higher was assumed positive. Results: There was no relationship between age and prevalence of positive BDI score, but prevalence of positive BDI score was higher in infertilities of longer duration, infertilities caused by both male and female factors and in patients with low level of education and history of previous treatment or surgical therapy. Conclusion: Infertile patients are at risk of depression. Rate of consulting with psychiatrists and getting help is low in our country due to cultural aspects, so screening of high risk subgroups in infertile patients and referring them to psychiatrist would be very helpful...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} {{millennium}} {{and across the}} length and breadth of China and beyond, people have been burning paper replicas of the material world to send to their deceased family members, ancestors, and myriads of imaginary beings. The paper replicas, which include all types of goods and treasures, mostly old and new forms of money, is {{commonly referred to as}} the paper money custom. Studies of the paper money custom have neglected the native opposition to it, especially that of the contemporary intelligentsia, one form of which consists of news reports and human interest stories in the popular press that lampoon the practice of burning paper money. Many stories lampoon the paper money custom by showing how it burlesques traditional virtues such as filial piety. One of the interesting maneuvers in this criticism is how it employs the old and newer kinds of paper monies to shape the response of the readers. FOR A THOUSAND YEARS people in China have been replicating their materialworld of social things in paper in order to provender and avail the family ghosts, ancestors, and myriads of imaginary beings by the magic of fire. Cut from an endless scroll of paper, the effigies replicate everyday items, utensils, <b>valuables,</b> money—a virtual <b>inventory</b> of things that constitute the effects of Chinese civilization, both old and new. The whole medley is a cornucopia of simulated consumption and desire on a cosmic scale. From its advent, common references to this custom employ plain locutions like zhı ̆ 纸 (paper), shāozhı ̆ 烧 纸 (burning paper) and zhı̆qián 纸 钱 (paper money), although there are numerous vernacular terms for this custom depending on locale. 1 During funerals and spirit festivals, the amount of simulated wealth that goes up in smoke and ash is a potlatch for the spirits. Even the commodity value of the paper burned can be impressive. The Guangming Daily News estimated that during any given Qingming festival (a memorial day near the Spring Equinox for sweeping family tombs), people in China spend more than ¥ 6 billion for the paper and incense offerings. “Adding in expenses for transportation and C.
