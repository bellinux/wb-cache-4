40|$|International audienceThe {{manufacturing}} process of clay tiles includes a pressing step {{in which the}} material undergoes stresses, that may result in the appearance of defects. To understand the phenomena involved, a numerical model of the pressing step was developed. Different tests were performed to determine the different behaviour laws necessary to the numerical simulation (rheological, tribological, damage). A rheological study, based on free compression tests, allowed to charaterize the elasto-visco-plastic behaviour of the extruded clay paste. The constitutive parameters were estimated by inverse analysis of the experimental force displacement curves using a Strategic evolution algorithm coupled with a metamodel. Two damage models, the Latham and Crockoft criterion and the Oyane criterion, were compared to model the cracking. To simulate the crack's propagation, an element deletion algorithm was used. The friction models of Coulomb and Tresca were investigated to model the global friction between the clay and the tools. The different parameters of the friction law were identified by inverse analysis of an experimental pressing force obtained during a shaping test.

Up to now, only heuristic methods have been used in practice. In this work, we focus on the polyhedral approach of the problem, it means on an exact method based on the polyhedral representation of the convex hull of feasible solutions. More precisely, we present a "Branch and Cut" algorithm for the classical vehicle routing problem with any unsplitable demands and identical vehicles located in a same depot. The originality of our work appears in three points : i) the discovery of new valid inequalities; ii) separation methods for these inequalities; iii) a "Branch and Cut" algorithm which combines the use of these methods with new enumeration strategies. This algorithm allows us to solve many instances from the literature, some of them which have never been solved to optimality before.

When a message arrives at a port, it is read into a buffer as soon as one is available. The router cyclically polls each port, bypassing ports without new messages. During the poll of a part icular port, the router reads the header information of the new message and inserts it into a scheduler table. This table is organized as N FIFO queues, one per output port.

The Influence of Private Players on International Financial Regulation, by Christian Chavagneux and Eric Nicolas Financial globalization {{raises the}} problem of monitoring the risks - particularly market risks — taken by financial institutions. Recent developments tend to show that this monitoring is increasingly difficult in terms of applying general rules of good conduct of the Cooke ratio type {{in view of the}} growing complexity of market activities and is increasingly moving towards a form of self-regulation by financial institutions themselves. Only the large financial institutions, particularly the American ones, now seem to have more or less the ability to control these risks. The supervisory authorities and smaller-sized financial institutions no longer appear to be capable of controlling them. Furthermore these self-regulation practices seem difficult to apply and do not constitute a guarantee sufficient to ensure the security of world finance, which currently appears to be a factor for instability of globalized capitalism.
