50|$|The most {{widespread}} {{application of}} cyclorotors is for ship propulsion and control. In ships the cyclorotor is mounted with {{the axis of}} rotation vertical so that thrust can quickly be vectored any direction in plane with the water surface. In 1922, Kurt Kirstin fitted a pair of cyclorotors to a 32 ft boat in Washington, which eliminated {{the need for a}} rudder and provided extreme maneuverability. While the idea floundered in the United States after the Kirsten-Boeing Propeller Company lost a US Navy research grant, the <b>Voith-Schneider</b> <b>propeller</b> company successfully commercially employed the propeller. This <b>Voith-Schneider</b> <b>propeller</b> was fitted to more than 100 ships prior to the outbreak of the second world war. Today, the same company sells the same propeller for highly maneuverable watercraft. It is applied on offshore drilling ships, tugboats, and ferries.|$|E
50|$|RMAS Fiona was a Felicity-class water tractor, {{built in}} 1973 by Hancocks. She {{displaced}} 80 tons, and was {{powered by a}} single <b>Voith-Schneider</b> <b>propeller</b> which generated 600 bhp {{and gave her a}} maximum speed of 10 knots. In 2007, she was placed on the Ministry of Defence Disposal Sales Agency website for £70,000.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the rotocycloid {{propeller}} are Russian and relates to aeronautic domain. Sverchkov's Samoljot, St-Peterburg, 1909, or [...] "wheel orthopter" [...] has been the first vehicle expressly thought for using this propulsion. Its scheme came near to cyclogiro, but it's difficult to classify it precisely. It had three flat surfaces and a rudder; rear edge of one of surfaces could be bent, replacing the action of an elevator. Lift and thrust had to be created by paddle wheels consisting of 12 blades, established in pairs under a 120° angle. The blades of a concave shape were changing an angle of incidence by the means of eccentrics and springs. In a bottom of the craft 10 hp engine was arranged. Transmission was ensured by a belt. Empty weight was about 200 kg. [...] "Samoljot" [...] was constructed by the military engineer E.P.Sverchkov with the grants of the Main Engineering Agency in St.Petersburg in 1909, was demonstrated at the Newest Inventions Exhibition and won a medal. Otherwise, it could not pass the preliminary tests without flying. In 1914, Russian inventor and scientist A.N. Lodygin has addressed to Russian government with the project of the cyclogiro-like aircraft, which scheme wabs similar to Sverchkov's [...] "Samoljot". The project was not carried out. In 1933, experiments in Germany by Adolf Rohrbach resulted in a paddle-wheel wing arrangement. Oscillating winglets went from positive to negative angles of attack during each revolution to create lift, and their eccentric mounting would, in theory, produce nearly any combination of horizontal and vertical forces. The DVL evaluated Rohrbach’s design, but the foreign aviation journals of the time {{cast doubt on the}} soundness of the design which meant that funding for the project could not be raised, even with a latter proposal as a Luftwaffe transport aircraft.There appears to be no evidence that this design was ever built, let alone flown.Based on Rohrbach’s paddle-wheel research, however, Platt in the US designed by 1933 his own independent Cyclogyro. His paddle-wheel wing arrangement was awarded a US patent (which was only one of many similar patents on file), and underwent extensive wind-tunnel testing at MIT in 1927. Despite this, there is no evidence Platt’s aircraft was ever built.The first operative cycloid propulsion has been developed at Voight. Its origins date to the decision of the Voith company to focus on the business of transmission gear assemblies for turbines. The famous Voight propeller has, based on its fluid-dynamics know-how gained from previous turbine projects. It was invented by Ernst Schneider, and enhanced by Voith. It was launched with name of <b>Voith-Schneider</b> <b>Propeller</b> (VSP) for commercial vessels. This new marine drive could significantly improve the manoeuvrability of a ship as demonstrated in the successful sea trials on the test boat Torqueo, in 1937. The first Voith Schneider Propellers were put into operation in the narrow canals of Venice, Italy. During the 1937 World Fair in Paris, Voith was awarded the grand prize - three times - for its exhibition of Voith Schneider Propellers and Voith turbo-transmissions. A year later, two of Paris' fire-fighting boats started operating with the new VSP system.|$|E
50|$|A marine {{thruster}} is {{a device}} for producing directed hydrodynamic thrust on a marine vehicle. The thrust direction may be fixed or steerable.Examples of marine thrusters include screw <b>propellers,</b> <b>Voith-Schneider</b> <b>propellers,</b> waterjets, ducted propellers, tunnel bow thrusters and stern thrusters, azimuth thrusters, rim-driven thrusters, ROV and submersible drive units.Marine thrusters {{may be used}} for propulsion, maneuvering and steering, attitude control and dynamic positioning.|$|R
50|$|Protector is {{propelled}} {{by a pair}} of <b>Voith-Schneider</b> <b>propellers,</b> an advanced propulsion system that bears some resemblance to helicopter propulsion, and enable instantaneous changes in the propeller thrust.She is 108 feet long, with a maximum speed of 13 knots. Her ten water cannon can pump 41,000 gallons per minute, more than four times as much as her predecessors. She is able to throw her water up to 236 ft in the air, and up to 580 ft away.|$|R
50|$|R/V Knorr {{was named}} in honor of Ernest R. Knorr, a {{distinguished}} hydrographic engineer and cartographer who was appointed Chief Engineer Cartographer of the U.S. Navy Hydrographic office in 1860. Chief Engineer Knorr was {{one of the leaders of}} the Navy’s first systematic charting and surveying effort from 1860 to 1885. She was launched in 1968 at the Defoe Shipbuilding Company in Bay City, Michigan, Knorr was delivered to Woods Hole in 1970. For her early life, she had <b>Voith-Schneider</b> <b>propellers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ships can be {{designed}} to be difficult for mines to detect, to avoid detonating them. This {{is especially true for}} minesweepers and mine hunters that work in minefields, where a minimal signature outweighs the need for armour and speed. These ships have hulls of glass fibre or wood instead of steel to avoid magnetic signatures, they use special propulsion systems, such as <b>Voith-Schneider</b> <b>propellers,</b> to limit the acoustic signature. They are built with hulls that produce a minimal pressure signature. These measures create other problems. They are expensive, slow, and vulnerable to enemy fire. Therefore, they need protection. Many modern ships have a mine-warning sonar—a simple sonar looking forward and warning the crew if it detects possible mines ahead. It is only effective when the ship is moving slowly. (See Also SQQ-32 Mine-hunting sonar) ...|$|R
50|$|A cyclorotor, {{cycloidal}} rotor, {{cycloidal propeller}} or cyclogiro, is a fluid propulsion device that converts shaft power into {{the acceleration of}} a fluid using a rotating axis perpendicular to the direction of fluid motion. It uses several blades with a spanwise axis parallel to the axis of rotation and perpendicular to the direction of fluid motion. These blades are cyclically pitched twice per revolution to produce force (thrust or lift) in any direction normal to the axis of rotation. Cyclorotors are used for propulsion, lift, and control on air and water vehicles. An aircraft using cyclorotors as {{the primary source of}} lift, propulsion, and control is known as a cyclogyro. The patented application, used on the ships with particular actuation mechanisms both mechanics or hydraulics is named from the name of the German company that produces them: <b>Voith-Schneider</b> cycloidal <b>propellers.</b>|$|R
