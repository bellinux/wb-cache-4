5000|$|Solidified resin {{from which}} the {{volatile}} terpene components have been removed by distillation is known as rosin. Typical rosin is a transparent or translucent mass, with a <b>vitreous</b> <b>fracture</b> and a faintly yellow or brown colour, non-odorous or having only a slight turpentine odor and taste. Rosin is insoluble in water, mostly soluble in alcohol, essential oils, ether and hot fatty oils, and softens and melts {{under the influence of}} heat, and burns with a bright but smoky flame.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the electrochemical deposition of Pb(II) onto <b>Fractured</b> <b>Vitreous</b> Carbon (FVC) electrodes from solutions containing very low concentrations {{of lead in}} different electrolytes (sulfate or chloride). To examine how the FVC surface state influences the lead deposition efficiency, the electrodes were subjected to different electrochemical pretreatments prior to the actual deposition process. The FVC electrode {{was used as a}} representative model of the vitreous carbon (VC) bulk, avoiding the polishing procedure that could change the surface. Electrochemical pretreatment was carried out by cyclic voltammetry in electrolytes containing chloride or nitrate anions and in some cases, ferrocyanide. Before and after the electrochemical pretreatment, the electrode surface morphology was assessed using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging. The quantity of lead deposited on the FVC electrode surface (lead deposition efficiency) in each experiment was estimated from the charge under the lead anodic, dissolution peak. Electrochemical pretreatment of electrodes in chloride or nitrate electrolytic baths consistently reduced the lead deposition efficiency. A detailed analysis, correlating lead deposition efficiencies to surface roughness and fractal dimension of the freshly prepared and electrochemically pretreated FVC electrodes, indicated that the decrease in efficiency corresponded to the change in electrode surface geometry. The greater efficiency of lead deposition observed in the chloride-containing electrolyte was due to the interaction between chloride and deposited lead rather than a chloride interaction with the FVC substrate...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the electrolytic removal of Pb(I 1) from aqueous solutions containing different electrolytes (nitrate, chloride or sulfate), by electrolysis onto reticulated vitreous carbon electrode (RVC). The {{efficiency of the}} electrolytic process of lead removal {{was found to be}} a function of electrolyte composition. The chloride containing electrolyte, provided the highest efficiency of lead removal, while removing Pb(I 1) from the sulfate electrolytes {{turned out to be a}} very difficult and high energy consuming process. Cyclic voltammetry and the atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to characterize lead deposits on RVC and <b>fractured</b> <b>vitreous</b> carbon (FVC) electrodes surface. Our study showed that in the chloride solution, a significantly larger amount of lead deposit was formed than in the sulfate electrolyte. Since the same phenomenon was observed with both electrode types, the FVC electrode is established as an appropriate laboratory model for studying the RVC, which is often used in industrial applications. AFM analysis revealed that lead deposits formed from different electrolyte solutions possess different surface morphologies, indicating different mechanism of formation or different kinds of interactions between the metal adlayer and the adsorbed anions. A highly dense lead deposit, spread all over the electrode surface, in the form of a 2 -D film, was found when using the chloride-containing electrolyte. This was attributed to the surface annealing effect and the increased number of nucleation sites due to chloride coadsorption at the electrode surface. Deposits formed from the sulfate electrolyte consisted of numerous, isolated and rather small lead clusters, indicating that deposition from sulfate solutions was inhibited by the formation of the passivated salt adlayer over the lead clusters. 0 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Fluor-elbaite, Na(Li 1. 5 Al 1. 5) Al 6 (Si 6 O 18) (BO 3) 3 (OH) 3 F, {{is a new}} mineral of the {{tourmaline}} supergroup. It {{is found}} in miarolitic cavities in association with quartz, pink muscovite, lepidolite, spodumene, spessartine, and pink beryl in the Cruzeiro and Urubu mines (Minas Gerais, Brazil), and apparently formed from late-stage hydrothermal solutions related to the granitic pegmatite. Crystals are blue-green with a <b>vitreous</b> luster, sub-conchoidal <b>fracture</b> and white streak. Fluor-elbaite has a Mohs hardness of approximately 7. 5, and has a calculated density of about 3. 1 g/cm 3. In plane-polarized light, fluor-elbaite is pleochroic (O = green/bluish green, E = pale green), uniaxial negative.
