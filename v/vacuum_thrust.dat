50|$|The {{idea behind}} the {{aerospike}} design is that at low altitude the ambient pressure compresses the exhaust against the spike. Exhaust recirculation in the base zone of the spike can raise the pressure in that zone to nearly ambient. Since the pressure {{in front of the}} vehicle is ambient, this means that the exhaust {{at the base of the}} spike nearly balances out with the drag experienced by the vehicle.

The characteristics of the N 2 O self-pressurization feeding process {{as well as the}} preheating process of a sub-Newton N 2 O thruster were studied. Experimental and simulated results indicated that the tank pressure decreases during the N 2 O self-pressurization process. The influence on the preheating process of the surface emissivity, the preheating power, the thickness of combustor chamber and the insulation material, were compared. N 2 O catalytic decomposition experiments were carried out to evaluate the reaction performance of Iridium impregnated modified alumina catalyst, such as activation temperature and reaction temperature. Successful activation and self-sustaining reaction were achieved at 523 K. It was found that the integral structure of the reactor and the loading factor of the catalyst-bed can influence the reaction effect. Based on further experiments looking for proper catalyst-bed, a thruster with a 4310 mm x 25 mm catalyst-bed was designed and fabricated. The vacuum performance of the thruster at different N 2 O flow rates was evaluated using a vacuum experimental system, which consists of a vacuum chamber and a sub-Newton-thrust measuring stand. Static <b>vacuum</b> <b>thrusts</b> ranging from around 140 mN to 970 mN were achieved with the flow rates altering from around 0. 1 g/s to 0. 6 g/s. The highest specific impulse reached 1640 N s/kg.

40|$|Linear aerostatic {{bearings}} {{are frequently}} used in high precision stages for their advantageous bearing properties, with low friction and absence of stick-slip being most notable. To improve relatively low out-of-plane stiffness of air bearings, pre-loading is applied. A common method of pre-loading is by utilizing vacuum, where a constant vacuum force decreases film height resulting in increased stiffness. Other methods for increasing stiffness are available, {{which is an}} active field of research. However, high stiffness results in strong coupling between bearing and running surface, transferring unwanted external vibrations. The amount of vibration transfer is quantified as transmissibility, which is the ratio of displacements between coupled surfaces. This property is frequency dependent. To reduce disturbance from external vibrations, this research focusses on reducing air bearing stiffness by combining pressurized and vacuum bearing pads, which to {{the knowledge of the}} author has not yet been researched. To analyse stiffness behaviour, air bearings have been modelled based on Reynolds equation. The effect of a vibrating running surface is modelled by linear perturbation of Reynolds equation. Resulting equations have been solved with a self developed finite volume method code, resulting in air film stiffness and damping as a function of frequency in an computationally efficient manner. Two combinations of <b>thrust</b> and <b>vacuum</b> bearings with a stable low stiffness operating point have been designed with the developed models. By offsetting <b>vacuum</b> and <b>thrust</b> surfaces or by using a micrometer pocket in the <b>thrust</b> bearing surface, <b>vacuum</b> and <b>thrust</b> stiffness cancel out, creating a range of low stiffness between regions with higher stiffness. To validate the models, air bearings have been manufactured. Measurements on restrictor properties have shown the literature model to be invalid for realistic pressure drops. Without taking the measured restrictor behaviour into account, model and measurement will not match. Also shown is that controlling surfaces flatness is essential for predictable bearing behaviour. Performance of available production methods is thoroughly researched. Model and measurement correspondence can only be achieved by taking surface properties into account. Also, the low tip-tilt stiffness of a single air bearing has been found to negatively effect measurements on film height. By using three bearings in the measurement set-up, tip-tilt stiffness has been significantly increased. This reduces measurement uncertainty. By taking these findings into account, excellent agreement between measurements and model has been achieved. This clears the way for development of a low stiffness prototype, combining <b>thrust</b> and <b>vacuum</b> bearings.

40|$|Microthrust engines (µN-mN) {{with high}} {{specific}} impulse and long lifetime that allow for precision attitude and orbit control are a prerequisite for planned and future missions for geodetic purposes or astronomic science [1]. The potential of laserablative microthrusters for meeting these demands is being investigated at the Institute of Technical Physics [2, 3]. The concept is based on layer-by-layer removal of {{a thin layer of}} material by focusing short laser pulses on a metal surface creating plasma or vapor (laser ablation) [4]. The recoil of the ablated material leads to momentum transfer to the target, which results in sub-µN to mN thrust levels for high repetition rate laser sources [5].

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a study of}} the external acceleration operating mode of a low-power linear-geometry Hall thruster. Measurements are reported of the performance and of the near exit plane ion velocity field in a high <b>vacuum</b> environment. <b>Thrust</b> and efficiency were measured at Stanford University, while ion velocities were measured in a similar vacuum environment at the Air Force Research Laboratory, using laser induced fluorescence of the excited state xenon ionic transition at 834. 7 nm. Velocities were measured primarily in the near field, from the channel exit plane to a downstream distance of 3 cm. Both axial and cross-field (along the electron Hall current direction) component velocities were measured. The results presented here, combined with those of previous studies, highlight the high sensitivity of the electron mobility to discharge properties inside and outside of the channel, such as background gas density, wall material, or magnetic field strength. When operated at low background pressure, this particular linear Hall discharge creates an ion accelerating electrostatic field that is 0. 5 – 2 cm downstream of the exit plane, well outside of the channel. This interesting mode of operation is attributed to the reduced electron impendence due to wall current at the terminating end of the electron drift. In this particular design, the consequence is a reduced level of performance, because of the non-ideal magnetic field configuration in the acceleration region. However, it suggests the possibility of new opportunities towards developing so-called wall-less Hall thruster, which have the promise of lower wall erosion. I...|$|R
40|$|Airbus Friedrichshafen {{is working}} on the {{development}} of a milliNewton HEMPT (High Efficiency Multistage Plasma Thruster) : an electrostatic thruster concept suitable for small satellite propulsion. An engineering model, the mN-μHEMPT, has been built and tested in <b>vacuum,</b> generating <b>thrust</b> levels in the range of 1 to 5 mN. Although the working principle is understood, there is still uncertainty in the loss process, in particular the heat transfer in the plasma-wall interaction. An efficient heat management is crucial for the operation of the thruster, as the performance of the magnets is severely hindered after reaching 250 ºC. With this in mind, the present thesis aims to produce the first thermal model of the mN-μHEMPT, with which a detailed thermal analysis can be carried out. The model validation strategy, based on correlation to testing results, makes it possible to overcome the uncertainty regarding the thermal losses. By simulating the operation of the thruster in extreme load cases in a Low Earth Orbit, its thermal performance is assessed, resulting in a detailed understanding of the temperature evolution and heat propagation through the different components. This information is then used to improve the performance by implementing design modifications. The result of the thesis is a thermal model validated to within 1. 65 ºC as mean deviation, predicting a maximum temperature of 180 ºC at the magnet stack during operation. The application of a boron nitride coating to the radiator and the decoupling of the heat losses at the magnet stack and at the anode thanks to a second radiator, results in a maximum temperature of the magnet stack of 85 ºC. In conclusion, the thermal performance of the mN-μHEMPT is analysed for the first time, and the design modifications proposed become a successful improvement.

The conventional ejector has been in existence {{for more than a century}} yet the design has remained largely unchanged and is difficult to optimise.

CFD provides the ability to study these processes, and to rapidly assess geometrical influence upon operational performance. The CFD model was assessed through systematic appraisal of the numerical parameters that influence solution stability and simulation accuracy. Two proprietary CFD codes were utilised; a structured segregated code and an adaptive mesh coupled code. Assessed parameters included; mesh dependency, discretisation schemes, turbulence models, and boundary layer models that are shown highly influential. Simulation was validated through comparison of predicted and experimental entrainment values. Simulations of an ejector that is part of a steam-jet refrigeration cycle were used to assess the influence of geometry and operating conditions. The structured code was found suitable for geometrical studies however the coupled code was required for detailed flow analysis. Geometrical studies showed current ejector design guidelines to be well set. Operational studies highlighted the dominant influence of motive fluid flow rate upon entrainment levels.
