40|$|In {{a typical}} VLSI design cycle, technology-dependent logic {{optimization}} may occur after the physical synthesis to satisfy various design constraints in area, power, timing, and testability. Recently, it is proposed in [7] an ATPGbased design rewiring methodology that achieves significant performance gains in benchmark circuits {{that are already}} optimized by formal techniques. This case study describes an application of this technique as a logic optimization platform for Motorola high-performance designs: Monarch. The flow, which consists of EDA <b>vendor</b> <b>tools</b> and inhouse software, allows the design error diagnosis and correction techniques of [7] {{to be applied to}} gate-level modules in high-performance cores.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel latch mapping {{methodology}} that judiciously leverages structural and functional analyses on digital sequential circuits. We {{make use of}} functional design constraints in a novel way to get latch correspondence information. For scanable latches we use a technique based on scan chain analysis to obtain latch correspondences. We also provide an effective heuristic for finding latch correspondences for latches (potentially non-scanable) in complex state machines having cyclic dependencies. Our methodology not only answers latch correspondence, but also provides polarity of the correspondence. This is a major advantage over earlier latch mapping algorithms. Experimental results obtained on embedded circuits from live PowerPC r○ 1 design projects have shown that our technique fares better than a leading <b>vendor</b> <b>tool</b> in mapping latches – in both quantitative (more latches mapped) and performance (time/memory used) aspects. ...|$|R
40|$|Overlay {{architectures}} are {{programmable logic}} {{systems that are}} compiled {{on top of a}} traditional FPGA.

This thesis describes the implementation of two FPGA overlay architectures, ZUMA and CARBON. These overlay implementations include optimizations to reduce area and increase speed which may be applicable to many other FPGAs and also ASIC systems.

40|$|Abstract. While fine-grain, {{reconfigurable}} {{devices have}} been available for years, they are mostly used in a fixed functionality, “asic-replacement” manner. To exploit opportunities for flexible and adaptable run-time exploitation of fine grain reconfigurable resources (as implemented cur-rently in dynamic, partial reconfiguration), better tool support is needed. The FASTER project aims to provide a methodology and a tool-chain that will enable designers to efficiently implement a reconfigurable system on a platform combining software and reconfigurable resources. Starting from a high-level application description and a target platform, our tools analyse the application, evaluate reconfiguration options, and implement the designer choices on underlying <b>vendor</b> <b>tools.</b> In addition, FASTER addresses micro-reconfiguration, verification, and the run-time manage-ment of system resources.
