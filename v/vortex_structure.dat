40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parametric {{study on the}} interaction of twin circular synthetic jets (SJs) that {{are in line with}} a crossflow over a flat plate. The resulting <b>vortex</b> <b>structures</b> under different actuation, and flow conditions are investigated using two-plane dye visualization in a water tunnel. The influence of four independent nondimensional parameters, i. e., the Reynolds number (Re-L), Strouhal number (St), velocity ratio (VR), and phase difference (Delta phi), on the behavior of the twin SJs is studied. It is found that the increase of Reynolds number causes the SJ-induced <b>vortex</b> <b>structures</b> more turbulent, making the twin SJ interaction less organized. The increase of velocity ratio pushes the occurrence of interaction further away from the wall and makes the resulting <b>vortex</b> <b>structures</b> more sustainable. The St has no obvious influence on the interaction. And three types of <b>vortex</b> <b>structures</b> are observed under different phase differences: one combined vortex, two completely separated vortices, and partially interacting <b>vortex</b> <b>structures.</b> Based on this parametric study, a simple model is proposed to predict the resulting vortex pattern for the twin SJ interaction.

50|$|Skyrmions {{operate at}} current densities that are several orders of {{magnitude}} weaker than conventional magnetic devices. In 2015 a practical way to create and access magnetic skyrmions under ambient room-temperature conditions was announced. The device used arrays of magnetized cobalt disks as artificial Bloch skyrmion lattices atop a thin film of cobalt and palladium. Asymmetric magnetic nanodots were patterned with controlled circularity on an underlayer with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Polarity is controlled by a tailored magnetic field sequence and demonstrated in magnetometry measurements. The <b>vortex</b> <b>structure</b> is imprinted into the underlayer's interfacial region via suppressing the PMA by a critical ion-irradiation step.

50|$|The {{sixth and}} final F3-F4 tornado to hit Georgia on March 27 touched down 8 mi {{northwest}} of Cedartown at about 7:00 p.m. EST. Though mainly impacting rural areas at first, it badly damaged four wood homes and blew down many trees with resultant F1 damage. The tornado appeared reddish to eyewitnesses {{as it passed}} through rugged terrain. As it crossed near Georgia State Route 100, the tornado produced major roof damage to a few homes and destroyed a pair of chicken coops. Widening to 0.5 mi wide, the tornado acquired a multiple <b>vortex</b> <b>structure</b> as residents observed two or three funnels rotating around the main vortex.

5000|$|Since {{the mass}} usage of computers, [...] direct {{numerical}} simulations or DNS {{have been used}} widely, producing vast data sets describing the complex evolution of flow. DNS indicates many complicated 3-dimensional vortices are embedded in regions of high shear near the surface. Researchers look around this region of high shear for indications of individual vortex structures based on accepted definitions, like coherent vortices. Historically, a vortex has been {{thought of as a}} region in the flow where a group of vortex lines come together hence indicating the presence of a vortex core, with groups of instantaneous circular paths about the core. In 1991, Robinson defined a <b>vortex</b> <b>structure</b> to be a core consisting of convected low pressure regions, where instantaneous streamlines can form circles or spiral shapes relative to the plane normal to the vortex core plane. Although {{it is not possible to}} track the evolution of hairpins over long periods, it is possible to identify and trace their evolution over short time periods. Some of the key notable features of hairpin vortices are how they interact with the background shear flow, other vortices, and how they interact with the flow near the surface.|$|E
40|$|Two-armed helical <b>vortex</b> <b>structures</b> are {{predicted}} in the two-electron momentum distributions produced in double photoionization (DPI) of the He atom {{by a pair}} of time-delayed elliptically polarized attosecond pulses with opposite helicities. These predictions are based upon both a first-order perturbation theory analysis and numerical solutions of the two-electron, time-dependent Schrödinger equation in six spatial dimensions. The helical <b>vortex</b> <b>structures</b> originate from Ramsey interference of a pair of ionized two-electron wave packets, each having a total angular momentum of unity, and appear in the sixfold differential DPI probability distribution for any energy partitioning between the two electrons. The <b>vortex</b> <b>structures</b> are exquisitely sensitive to the time delay between the two pulses, their relative phase, their ellipticity, and their handedness; moreover, they occur in a variety of electron detection geometries. However, the <b>vortex</b> <b>structures</b> only occur when the angular separation β = cos− 1 (ˆp 1 · ˆp 2) between the electron momenta p 1 and p 2 is held fixed. The <b>vortex</b> <b>structures</b> can also be observed in the fourfold differential DPI probability distribution obtained by averaging the sixfold differential probability over the emission angles of one electron. Such kinematical vortices are a general phenomenon that may occur in any ionization process, initiated by two time-delayed short pulses with opposite ellipticities, for particular detection geometries...|$|R

The resulting <b>vortex</b> <b>structures</b> at four phase differences, i. e., Δϕ = 0 °, 90 °, 180 °, and 270 °, are presented and compared using both stereo dye visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. Three types of <b>vortex</b> <b>structures</b> are observed: one combined vortex at Δϕ = 90 °, two completely separated hairpin vortices at Δϕ = 270 °, and partially interacting <b>vortex</b> <b>structures</b> at Δϕ = 0 ° and 180 °. The combined vortex is the strongest and most penetrates into the boundary layer.

50|$|By 6:35 p.m., {{the tornado}} had {{expanded}} {{to just over}} 600 yards wide and was approaching maximum intensity. It continued to move northeast exiting the Wichita metro area and reached F5 intensity as it tore through the town of Andover, Kansas. Thirteen people were killed as the Golden Spur Mobile Home Park was obliterated, with little left there but scattered debris and twisted mobile home frames. The death toll included {{a father and son}} who abandoned their car and sought shelter in a ditch nearby. Extensive wind-rowing of debris and grass scouring was noted as the tornado swept large, well-constructed homes with anchor bolts cleanly from their foundations just west of N Andover Road as the tornado passed through densely populated residential areas. Vehicles were thrown nearly a mile from where they originated, and trees in the area were completely debarked. One vehicle that originated at the Golden Spur mobile home park was thrown 3/4 of a mile, and was so thoroughly mangled that surveyors could not determine if it was a car or a truck. The tornado then veered north, missing a Girl Scout camp where summer camp training was being conducted and a troop campout. The tornado then moved on to the northeast, passing just south of Towanda. The damage in this area was rated at F4 intensity as additional well-built homes were leveled. The tornado continued northeast and reached El Dorado Lake just before 7pm (CST). Video taken by local storm chasers shows that the tornado crossed over the lake and revealed a multiple <b>vortex</b> <b>structure.</b> Just after crossing over the lake to the northeast, the circulation dissipated and died out. The Andover tornado had traveled for nearly 46 miles, and was on the ground for over an hour.|$|E

To study the BEC-BCS crossover the two most common methods are the Bogoliubov-De Gennes theory and the usage of an effective field theory.

40|$|The {{properties}} of a locally frozen (in {{a region of}} diameter 0. 5 mm) magnetic field in a YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x slab 0. 5 mm thick are investigated {{as a function of}} the value of the excitation field, the regime of freezing, and the transport current through the sample. The first regime is cooling of the ceramic to 77 K in the excitation field with a subsequent turning off of the excitation field, and the second regime is cooling in the Earth's magnetic field with a subsequent turning on and off of the excitation field. At an excitation field up to 2000 A/m in these regimes two different types of macroscopic current vortex structures, which generate the frozen field, are formed. The local critical field of excitation when the <b>vortex</b> <b>structure</b> is formed in the second regime exceeds the uniform perpendicular critical field of the slab by a factor of 10 and equals 1700 A/m. On the other hand, the <b>vortex</b> <b>structure</b> of the first type can be formed by practically any weak excitation field, including fields smaller than the critical field of the <b>vortex</b> <b>structure</b> of the second type. In a representation of the ceramic as a Josephson medium, physical models of the two types of vortex structures are proposed which correspond most fully to the results of experiments. The displacement of the <b>vortex</b> <b>structure</b> of the first type upon the passage of transport current through the slab, as a result of the action of the Lorentz force on that structure, is registered. This makes it possible to calculate the pinning force Fp and to estimate the value of the viscosity n for the motion of such a <b>vortex</b> <b>structure</b> in the ceramic: Fp= 6 x 10 - 8 N, n = 6 x 10 - 5 kg/s.
