Therefore a mathematical method is developed to numerically depict the progress of the miller with different curves A(t), B(t) and C(t). These curves are used to map the state of the milling path during the production process as well as to compare the current workpiece contour and the target workpiece contour. The tool center point (TCP) correction results from mapping of time-dependent deformation fields from the FE simulation.

30|$|Heterogeneity is {{a visual}} {{perception}} that varies by person. In clinical practice, physicians subjectively analyze {{the heterogeneity of}} medical images {{because of the lack}} of an objective and reliable method to quantify this parameter. In functional imaging, such as nuclear medicine, the analysis of image heterogeneity is complex because of a low signal-to-noise ratio and low spatial resolution. Artifacts from the reconstruction process are another type of noise superimposed on images dedicated to the exam's interpretation. Because of this subjective aspect, quantification and analysis of the heterogeneity of medical images are complex and less reproducible. An ideal mathematical method would be reproducible, objective and would provide results that are correlated with the physician's results. Some methods have been described in the literature to solve the problem of a varying analysis of heterogeneity in medical images. These methods are mostly based on a fractal analysis [15, 17], coefficient of <b>variation</b> <b>calculation</b> [11], and texture analysis [18 – 23].

Algorithms for the universal <b>variation</b> <b>calculation</b> have been developed and are used to process the ionospheric vertical sounding data for 1957 – 1990. It is shown that the foF 2 -universal variation forms are es-sentially different for solar minima and maxima years. In the solar minima years, the foF 2 -universal variation {{is similar to the}} known universal variation of the atmospheric electric field near the Earth’s surface which has a maximum at 19 UT. There is no foF 2 -universal variation seasonal change in solar minimum years. The foF 2 -universal variation form changes for solar maximum years have a minimum of foF 2, at 16 – 17 UT, and there are small seasonal changes in the foF 2 -universal variation. Such behaviour of the foF 2 -universal variation suggests that under the quiet conditions in solar minimum years the electric field penetrates from the lower atmospheric layers up to the F 2 layer of the ionosphere.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Microenvironmental {{conditions}} in normal or tumour tissues and cell lines may interfere on further biological analysis. To evaluate transcript variations carefully, {{it is common}} to use stable housekeeping genes (HKG) to normalise quantitative microarrays or real-time polymerase chain reaction results. However, recent studies argue that HKG fluctuate according to tissues and treatments. So, as an example of HKG variation under an array of conditions that are common in the cancer field, we evaluate whether hypoxia could have an impact on HKG expression. METHODS: Expression of 10 commonly used HKG was measured on four cell lines treated with four oxygen concentrations (from 1 to 20 %). RESULTS: Large variations of HKG transcripts were observed in hypoxic conditions and differ along with the cell line and the oxygen concentration. To elect the most stable HKG, we compared the three statistical means based either on PCR cycle threshold coefficient of <b>variation</b> <b>calculation</b> or two specifically dedicated software. Nevertheless, the best HKG dramatically differs according to the statistical method used. Moreover, using, as a reference, absolute quantification of a target gene (here the proteinase activating receptor gene 1 (PAR 1) gene), we show that the conclusions raised about PAR 1 variation in hypoxia can totally diverge according to the selected HKG used for normalisation. CONCLUSION: The choice of a valid HKG will determine the relevance of the results that will be further interpreted, and so it should be seriously considered. The results of our study confirm unambiguously that HKG variations must be precisely and systematicall...|$|E

The study was conducted on outpatients in Sweden in 2002 to 2005. Included in the pharmacokinetic evaluation were 155 patients (68 % women and 32 % men) aged 17 to 95 years (average, 51 years). One serum sample per patient, taken as a trough value insteady state, was assessed. For the inter- and intraindividual <b>variation</b> <b>calculation,</b> 16 patients were included with two eligible samples each. The median daily dose was 20 mg/day (range, 5 - 40 mg). Extensive overall serum concentration variability was seen for all dose levels. The interindividual coefficient of variation for dose-normalized concentrations was 71 % for S-citalopram, 36 % for S-desmethylcitalopram, and 50 % for S-didesmethylcitalopram. The intraindividual variations over time for the same parameters were approximately 30 %, except for the ratio S-desmethylcitalopram/Scitalopram, which was 23 %. The median S-desmethylcitalopram level was approximately 60 % of the parent substance and the S-didesmethylcitalopram level approximately 9 %.

We utilize high-resolution spectropolarimetry and the magnetic Doppler imaging (MDI) technique to simultaneously determine the magnetic configuration, which is predominately dipolar, with a polar strength Bd = 7. 3 - 7. 8 kG and a smaller non-axisymmetric quadrupolar contribution, {{as well as the}} surface distribution of abundance of He, Fe, C, and Si. We describe a revised RRM model that now accepts an arbitrary surface magnetic field configuration, with the field topology from the MDI models used as input. The resulting synthetic Ha emission and broadband photometric observations generally agree with observations, however, several features are poorly fit. To explore the possibility of a photospheric contribution to the observed photometric variability, the MDI abundance maps were used to compute a synthetic photospheric light curve to determine the effect of the surface inhomogeneities. Including the computed photospheric brightness modulation fails to improve the agreement between the observed and computed photometry. We conclude that the discrepancies cannot be explained as an effect of inhomogeneous surface abundance. Analysis of the UV light variability shows good agreement between observed variability and computed light curves, supporting the accuracy of the photospheric light <b>variation</b> <b>calculation.</b> We thus conclude that significant additional physics is necessary for the RRM model to acceptably reproduce observations of not only sigma Ori E, but also other similar stars with significant stellar wind-magnetic field interactions.

Six typical loop configurations with different reserve capacities are presented and evaluated. Each loop configuration is evaluated in three different areas with different load and customer profiles.

Failure and restoration statistics from the DSO in Gothenburg, Goteborg Energi Nat AB, are used as input parameters to the models of the different loop configurations.

The current, existing configuration of the examined loops does not allow any additional load to be connected while still allocating for reserve capacity.

For the first year, higher than expected energy loads result in a solar energy cover factor of 65 – 87 % of delivered electricity. The PV generation performs satisfactorily, hence, {{it may be possible}} to achieve energy goals during later years provided technical adjustments or behavioral changes...|$|R
40|$|This project {{revolves}} around studying estimators for parameters in different Time Series models and studying their assymptotic properties. We introduce various bootstrap techniques for the estimators obtained. Our special {{emphasis is on}} Weighted Bootstrap. We establish the consistency of this scheme in a AR model and its <b>variations.</b> Numerical <b>calculations</b> lend further support to our consistency results. Next we analyze ARCH models, and study various estimators used for different error distributions. We also present resampling techniques for estimating {{the distribution of the}} estimators. Finally by simulating data, we analyze the numerical properties of the estimators. Comment: Master's Projec...|$|R
