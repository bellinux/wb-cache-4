5|$|The wargames {{from which}} Dungeons & Dragons evolved used {{miniature}} figures to represent combatants. D initially continued {{the use of}} miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original D set of 1974 required {{the use of the}} Chainmail miniatures game for combat resolution. By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus miniatures were no longer required for game play, although some players continued to use them as a <b>visual</b> <b>reference.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} trapeze is {{a device}} used in recreational diving and technical diving to make decompression stops {{more comfortable and}} more secure and provide the divers' surface cover with a <b>visual</b> <b>reference</b> for the divers' position. It consists of a horizontal bar or bars suspended at the depth of intended decompression stops by buoys. The bars are of sufficient weight and the buoys of sufficient buoyancy that the trapeze will not easily change depth in turbulent water or if the divers experience buoyancy control problems.|$|E
5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy at their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack. The diver ascends along the shotline, and may use it purely as a <b>visual</b> <b>reference,</b> or can hold on to it to positively control depth, or can climb up it hand over hand. A Jonline may be used to fasten a diver to a shotline during a decompression stop.|$|E

5|$|Reading is {{considered}} to be a key element of vocabulary development in school-age children. Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a <b>visual</b> <b>reference</b> or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences. Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the new word back to the adult. When a child begins to learn to read, their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary. By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{believe that}} Hughes entered {{an area of}} deteriorating weather with low {{visibility}} and lost his <b>visual</b> <b>reference</b> with the ground. This induced spatial disorientation and eventually led to a graveyard spiral with the aircraft entering into a right-hand diving turn, with a nose-down attitude of 25°. When the aircraft cleared the clouds, Hughes attempted to arrest the high descent rate by pulling the nose up and applying full power, {{but it was too}} late. The FAA investigators later found evidence that the propeller was at maximum speed during impact.|$|E

However, they both end up battling Elika's father once again. They escape, and attempt to leave the palace alive. While on their way, Elika shows her frustration with the Prince multiple times, believing bringing her back was not {{worth the price of}} the evil it unleashed. The Prince counters that by freeing her, they 'stand a chance' against Ahriman. In a final battle against Elika's father, the Prince defeats him by impaling him on spikes, a <b>visual</b> <b>reference</b> to the original Prince of Persia game. In the end, Elika leaves the Prince to search for her people, and the Prince is left alone with a bloodthirsty Ahriman seeking revenge.|$|E

25|$|After the Clear Lake show ended (at around midnight), Holly, Valens and Richardson {{drove to}} the Mason City Airport, loaded their luggage and boarded the red and white {{single-engine}} Beechcraft Bonanza. At around 1:00am on February 3, 1959, pilot Roger Peterson received clearance from the control tower, taxied down the runway and took off. But the plane remained airborne {{for only a few}} minutes. For an unknown reason, shortly after takeoff, the plane slammed into the ground at full throttle about 5 miles outside Mason City, in the middle of farm country. Peterson may have lost his <b>visual</b> <b>reference</b> and thought he was ascending while he was actually descending. It is also possible that he had mechanical problems and was attempting to turn back toward Mason City. The right wingtip of the Beechcraft Bonanza sliced into the frozen ground and sent the aircraft cartwheeling across a cleared cornfield at approximately 170mph.|$|E

By this time the fog horn on the Skull Martin Lightship could be clearly heard, but with visibility reported to be down to less than a mile, it was proving impossible to make the required <b>visual</b> <b>reference</b> to calibrate the speed. The prevailing conditions coupled to the high density of shipping traffic in the area forced an abandonment of the trial. Speed was reduced to , the Ben-my-Chree was swung about, and made passage back to Greenock. The inclement weather lasted into the following day, leading {{to the rest of the}} trials to be held on Friday.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} departed Monto a {{few minutes}} after 11:00 on a direct track towards Caboolture carrying the pilot and five non-paying passengers. The weather for the flight was expected to be VFR (visual flight rules) conditions with good visibility, high clouds and light winds. At 13:15, the aircraft contacted air traffic control, reporting an approximate position 69km north of Caboolture and requesting assistance with navigation. Shortly after, the pilot issued a distress call as the aircraft had entered thick cloud. Controllers in Brisbane then communicated positional information to the aircraft directly and relayed via other pilots in the area due to difficulties with radio reception. A friend of one of the passengers aboard Riama {{received a phone call from}} the aircraft, reporting that they were lost in cloud and unable to maintain altitude at around 13:20. Over the next hour, witnesses in the area around the crash site reported seeing the aircraft flying in and out of cloud at low level. At 13:48, the pilot reported he had one hour of fuel remaining and the last transmission from the aircraft came at 14:04. Neither the aircraft or the pilot were equipped or certified to fly without <b>visual</b> <b>reference</b> to the ground.|$|E
