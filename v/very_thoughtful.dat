500|$|Drawing {{attention}} to the intrinsically manipulative nature of the medium, Nolan uses narrative and stylistic techniques (notably mise en abyme and recursions) to stimulate the viewer to ask themselves why his films are put together in such ways and why the films provoke particular responses. He sometimes uses editing {{as a way to}} represent the characters' psychological states, merging their subjectivity with that of the audience. For example, in Memento the fragmented sequential order of scenes is to put the audience into a similar experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories. In The Prestige, the series of magic tricks and themes of duality and deception mirror the structural narrative of the film. His writing style incorporates a number of storytelling techniques such as flashbacks, shifting points of view and unreliable narrators. Scenes are often interrupted by the unconventional editing style of cutting away quickly from the money shot (or nearly cutting off characters' dialogue) and crosscutting several scenes of parallel action to build to a climax. In 2017, noted film theorist and historian David Bordwell wrote about Nolan's fascination with subjective storytelling and crosscutting, [...] "It's rare to find any mainstream director so relentlessly focused on exploring a particular batch of storytelling techniques ... Nolan zeroes in, from film to film, on a few narrative devices, finding new possibilities in what most directors handle routinely. He seems to me a <b>very</b> <b>thoughtful,</b> almost theoretical director in his fascination with turning certain conventions this way and that, to reveal their unexpected possibilities." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} varied {{reviews from}} critics and viewers. Reviewers generally disliked the episode's humor, but were {{positive about the}} more serious moments. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club believed that the show's concept, which allowed only two characters and a single scene, was [...] "ambitious" [...] but that the end result was [...] "flaccid." [...] He commented that with no cut-away gags or side plots, the episode was [...] "basically everything critics of the show would like the show to have" [...] but was deprived of Family Guys trademark fast pace and reduced to [...] "a series of what amounts to grossout comedy sketches." [...] Television critic Ramsey Isler of IGN added that the gross-out humor [...] "didn't work for me" [...] and found the [...] "more serious stuff" [...] in the episode {{to be the most}} entertaining. Said Isler, [...] "the addition of more dramatic themes and the elimination of the cutaway gags really showed what this show could be if Seth [...] and team put more effort in." [...] In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Isler listed [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as being [...] "surprisingly dramatic," [...] and, [...] "had {{it not been for the}} extended poop-eating jokes and rehashed musical numbers in the second half, I'd say it was one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad was also [...] "more than a little disturbed" [...] by the amount of time spent on Stewie's soiled diaper. However, he noted, [...] "I didn't laugh much at 'Brian & Stewie', but I found myself absolutely captured by their discussion throughout the episode." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "tedious, predictably vulgar, and, by the end, sentimental." [...] Adam Rosenberg of MTV wrote, [...] "Beneath all of the more disturbing elements there's actually some <b>very</b> <b>thoughtful,</b> mature discussion of suicide and what love means amidst it all." [...] Andrew Hanson of The Los Angeles Times found the soiled diaper gag [...] "too sick to watch" [...] and [...] "the grossest" [...] moment featured in Family Guy so far, but conceded that that may have been the producer's intention. Still, Hanson described Brian's suicidal confession as [...] "deep" [...] and stated, [...] "It’s nice to see that Family Guy is still trying new things and going out on a limb even at episode No. 150." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number seven on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and said he [...] "loved" [...] this episode due its feature of Brian and Stewie's relationship. He added that the episode was [...] "particularly great" [...] because it featured no cutaway gags and was a two-hander, noting that [...] "Clearly, the writers know exactly what the fans want." ...|$|E

[...] Colin Powell—Rice's predecessor as Secretary of State—described Obama's speech as [...] "a very, <b>very</b> <b>thoughtful,</b> direct speech", and added: [...] "I admired him for giving it, and I agreed with much of what he said." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Princess chose her {{dressing}} style based {{on both the}} Royal Family's demands and popular modern styles in Britain, and developed her personal trend of fashion. While on diplomatic trips, her numerous clothes and attire were chosen to match the destination countries' costumes, and while off-duty she used to wear loose jackets and jumpers. [...] "She was always <b>very</b> <b>thoughtful</b> about how her clothes would be interpreted, {{it was something that}} really mattered to her," [...] stated Anna Harvey, a former editor of Vogue and the Princess's fashion mentor. David Sassoon, one of the designers who worked with Diana, believed that she had [...] "broken the rules" [...] with trying new styles. Diana chose not to practice some of the royal methods for clothing including putting aside the tradition of wearing gloves as she believed it would prevent direct connection with the people she met, such as those affected by serious diseases like AIDS patients. She used to wear certain types of ensembles and clothes at charity events which would also match the mentality of the people she would meet, for instance wearing colourful dresses and [...] "jangling jewels" [...] so she could easily play with children at hospitals. According to Donatella Versace who had closely worked with the Princess alongside her brother, Diana's interest and sense of curiosity in fashion grew significantly after her separation from Charles. Versace also points out that [...] " [...] think that anyone, before or after her, has done for fashion what Diana did." ...|$|E
