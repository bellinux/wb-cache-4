5|$|The breed has a {{reputation}} for being healthy with a long lifespan. Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct in-line breeding has been prevented. Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain lines have been noted for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes. These issues can include hereditary cataracts, ectopia lentis, congenital deafness, patellar luxation, ataxia, myasthenia gravis, Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, and <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two genetic health {{concerns}} {{seen in the}} breed are <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> <b>disease</b> (vWD) and craniomandibular osteopathy (CMO); Scottie cramp, patellar luxation and cerebellar abiotrophy are also sometimes seen in this breed. Common eye conditions seen {{in a variety of}} breeds such as cataracts and glaucoma can appear in Scotties as they age. There are no specific conditions relating the skin that affect the breed, but they can be affected by common dog related conditions such as parasites and mange. Scotties typically live from 11 to 13 years.|$|E
5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of Miniature Schnauzers {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> <b>disease</b> (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|E

50|$|The {{important}} role of depletion of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor in aortic stenosis was first proposed in 1992 by Warkentin et al. They noted a known association between aortic stenosis (in addition to other cardiac <b>diseases)</b> and acquired <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease</b> type IIA, which is corrected by surgical replacement of the aortic valve. They also noted that <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease</b> is known to cause bleeding from angiodysplasia. Based on these facts, they hypothesized that acquired <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease</b> is the true culprit behind gastrointestinal bleeding in aortic stenosis. They also proposed a possible mechanism for the acquired <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease,</b> noting that <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor is most active in 'high shear' vessels (meaning small vessels in which blood flows rapidly). They used this fact to hypothesize that this may mean that <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor is activated in the narrowed stenotic aortic valve and thus cleared from circulation {{at a much higher}} rate than in healthy individuals.|$|R
25|$|<b>Von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> <b>disease</b> {{can also}} affect some breeds of dogs, notably the Doberman Pinscher, and {{screening}} is offered for known breeds.|$|E
25|$|Thrombocythemia {{is another}} cause of {{acquired}} <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> <b>disease,</b> due to sequestration of vWF via the adhesion of {{vast numbers of}} platelets. Acquired vWD has also been described in Wilms' tumour, hypothyroidism, and placental mesenchymal dysplasias.|$|E

25|$|<b>Von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> <b>disease</b> (which behaves {{more like}} a {{platelet}} disorder except in severe cases), {{is the most common}} hereditary bleeding disorder and is characterized as being inherited autosomal recessive or dominant. In this disease, there is a defect in von Willebrand factor (vWF), which mediates the binding of glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) to collagen. This binding helps mediate the activation of platelets and formation of primary hemostasis.|$|E
25|$|Vasopressin {{agonists}} {{are used}} therapeutically in various conditions, and its long-acting synthetic analogue desmopressin {{is used in}} conditions featuring low vasopressin secretion, {{as well as for}} control of bleeding (in some forms of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> <b>disease</b> and in mild haemophilia A) and in extreme cases of bedwetting by children. Terlipressin and related analogues are used as vasoconstrictors in certain conditions. Use of vasopressin analogues for esophageal varices commenced in 1970.|$|E
25|$|Platelet {{conditions}} may be congenital or acquired. Some inborn platelet pathologies are Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, Bernard-Soulier syndrome (abnormal glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex), gray platelet syndrome (deficient alpha granules), and delta storage pool deficiency (deficient dense granules). Most are rare conditions. Most inborn platelet pathologies predispose to hemorrhage. <b>Von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> <b>disease</b> {{is due to}} deficiency or abnormal function of von Willebrand factor, and leads to a similar bleeding pattern; its milder forms are relatively common.|$|E

25|$|Genetic {{conditions}} {{are a problem}} in some dogs, particularly purebreeds. For this reason many of the national kennel clubs require that dogs with certain genetic illnesses or who are deemed to be carriers cannot be registered. Some {{of the most common}} conditions include hip dysplasia, seen in large breed dogs, <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> <b>disease,</b> a disease that affects platelets that is inherited in Doberman Pinschers, entropion, a curling in of the eyelid seen in Shar Peis and many other breeds, progressive retinal atrophy, inherited in many breeds, deafness, and epilepsy, known to be inherited in Belgian Shepherd Dogs, German Shepherd Dogs, Cocker Spaniels, and St. Bernards.|$|E
25|$|Hereditary or {{acquired}} defects of vWF lead to <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> <b>disease</b> (vWD), {{a bleeding}} diathesis {{of the skin}} and mucous membranes, causing nosebleeds, menorrhagia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The {{point at which the}} mutation occurs determines the severity of the bleeding diathesis. There are three types (I, II and III), and type II is further divided in several subtypes. Treatment depends {{on the nature of the}} abnormality and the severity of the symptoms. Most cases of vWD are hereditary, but abnormalities of vWF may be acquired; aortic valve stenosis, for instance, has been linked to vWD type IIA, causing gastrointestinal bleeding - an association known as Heyde's syndrome.|$|E
5|$|<b>Von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease</b> is a {{hereditary}} {{bleeding disorder}} found in both dogs and humans. It {{is caused by}} a lack of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor which plays a role in the clotting process of blood. This can cause abnormal platelet function and prolonged bleeding times. Affected dogs can be prone to nose bleeds, and increased bleeding following trauma or surgery. There are three types of this condition with Type I being the most common, while Type II and III being rarer, but more severe. Type I <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease</b> is relatively common in the Scottish Terrier.|$|R
40|$|In normal plasma, {{the ratio}} of the procoagulant {{activity}} of factor VIII (VIIIAHF) to that of the <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor activity (ristocetin cofactor, VIIIVWF) or factor VIII antigen (VIIIAGN) is ∼ 1, but ratios > 1 (e. g., VIIIAHF > VIIIVWF or VIIIAGN) may be observed in some patients with <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease</b> and in the “late” posttransfusion plasmas of patients with this disorder. The lability of VIIIAHF was studied by incubating plasma, diluted 1 : 10 in imidazole buffer pH 7. 1, for 6 h at 37 °C. With normal plasmas, 77 ± 12 % (SD) of the original VIIIAHF activity remained after incubation. VIIIAHF was labile (e. g., 35 - 55 % residual activity) in the “late” posttransfusion plasmas (VIIIAHF ≫ VIIIVWF) of a patient with <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease,</b> but not in the “early” posttransfusion plasmas (VIIIAHF ∼ VIIIVWF). VIIIAHF was also labile in the (base-line) plasmas of three patients with <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease</b> in whom the ratios of VIIIAHF to VIIIVWF were 4. 4 to 8. 1, but not in the plasmas of four other patients in whom the ratio was ∼ 1. The electrophoretic mobility of factor VIII antigen was increased in two of the three patients with labile VIIIAHF. In both of these patients, and in the late posttransfusion plasmas, labile VIIIAHF activity could be stabilized by the addition of purified <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor (lacking VIIIAHF activity) or by hemophilic plasma, but not by plasmas of patients with severe <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease.</b> Thus, VIIIVWF may serve to stabilize VIIIAHF and this might explain the posttransfusion findings in <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R

2500|$|... vWF plays a {{major role}} in blood coagulation. Therefore, vWF {{deficiency}} or dysfunction (<b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> <b>disease)</b> leads to a bleeding tendency, which is most apparent in tissues having high blood flow shear in narrow vessels. From studies it appears that vWF uncoils under these circumstances, decelerating passing platelets. Recent research also suggests that von Willebrand factor is involved in the formation of blood vessels themselves, which would explain why some people with <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> <b>disease</b> develop vascular malformations (predominantly in the digestive tract) that can bleed excessively.|$|E
2500|$|... vWF {{is named}} after Dr. Erik von Willebrand (1870–1949), a Finnish doctor who in 1924 first {{described}} a hereditary bleeding disorder in families from the Åland islands, who had a tendency for cutaneous and mucosal bleeding, including menorrhagia.

2500|$|Von Willebrand factor (vWF) (...) is a blood {{glycoprotein}} {{involved in}} hemostasis.

2500|$|<b>Von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> <b>disease</b> (vWD) (...) , {{discovered}} by Erik Adolf von Willebrand, {{is the most}} common hereditary blood-clotting disorder in humans. An acquired form can sometimes result from other medical conditions. It arises from a deficiency in the quality or quantity of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion. It is known to affect humans and several breeds of dogs. The three forms of vWD are: hereditary, acquired, and pseudo or platelet type. The three types of hereditary vWD are: vWD type 1, vWD type 2, and vWD type 3. Type 2 contains various subtypes. Platelet type vWD is also an inherited condition.|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, {{we showed that}} the abnormality of ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma in 10 patients with <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease</b> could be corrected by a factor in normal plasma that was present in the same fractions as factor VIII procoagulant activity (antihemophilic factor, AHF, VIIIAHF) when prepared by chromatography on Bio-Gel 5 M (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, Calif.). This observation suggests that patients with this disorder are deficient in a plasma factor, associated with the factor VIII molecule, that is necessary for normal platelet function. In the present paper, we describe, an assay for this factor, the <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor (VIIIVWF), based on the observation that a log-log relationship exists {{between the amount of}} ristocetin-induced aggregation of washed, normal platelets and the concentration of normal plasma present in the test system. We assayed the activity of VIIIVWF as well as antihemophilic factor procoagulant activity (VIIIAHF) and factor VIII antigen (VIIIAGN) in 15 patients with <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease</b> and 20 normal subjects. A highly significant correlation (r ∼ 0. 80) between VIIIVWF and both VIIIAHF was found in normal subjects and in patients with <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease.</b> This finding, in addition to the observation that agarose gel chromatography fractions that have VIIIAHF procoagulant activity also have VIIIVWF activity, strongly suggests that the <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor is associated with the factor VIII molecule. VIIIVWF in normal plasma was not inhibited by human anti-VIII, and VIIIVWF levels were normal in hemophilic plasma. Thus, the VIIIVWF site on the factor VIII molecule appears to be different from that determining VIIIAHF. Finally, the activity of VIIIVWF appeared to correlate better with the bleeding time than either VIIIAHF or VIIIAGN. This suggests that VIIIVWF assayed in this study may be the “anti-bleeding factor” that is deficient in <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease.</b> These findings are consistent with a decreased synthesis of the factor VIII molecule in <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease</b> and suggest the possibility of additional abnormalities of the site on the molecule that determines the activity of VIIIVWF...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether the prolonged bleeding time so common to chronic renal failure (CRF) was due to defective factor VIII-related activities, as in <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> <b>disease,</b> vascular-factor VIII-related protein was measured in patients with CRF.
