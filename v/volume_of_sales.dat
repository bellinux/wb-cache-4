30|$|To {{disprove}} {{the null}} hypothesis we create a linear model. The model aims at explaining a shop’s retention rate at increasing distances. Then, we characterize the shop’s size using three different measures. The first measure is the total <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> its <b>sales,</b> i.e. {{the number of items}} that have been purchased in the shop. A larger shop generates high <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales.</b> The second measure is the shop’s variety or assortment, i.e. the number of different products that can be purchased in the shop. Larger shops have a larger assortment of products. The last measure is the shop’s sophistication. The shop’s sophistication can be viewed as the average sophistication of the products sold at the shop, {{in the same way as}} the country sophistication is the average sophistication of the products it exports [7].|$|R

25|$|Costco {{focuses on}} selling {{products}} at low prices, often {{at very high}} volume. These goods are usually bulk-packaged and marketed primarily to large families and businesses. Furthermore, Costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item {{is essentially the same}} except when it has a house brand to sell, generally by the Kirkland Signature label. This results in a high <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> from a vendor, allowing further reductions in price, and reducing marketing costs. A typical Costco warehouse carries only 4,000 distinct products, while a typical Walmart Supercenter carries approximately 140,000 products.|$|E

25|$|Weber's {{theory can}} {{explain some of}} the causes for current movement, yet such {{discussion}} did not come from Weber himself. Weber found industrial activity the least expensive to produce. Least cost location then implies marketing the product at the least cost to the consumer, much like retailers attempt to obtain large market shares today. Economically, it is explained as one way to make a profit; creating the cheapest product for the consumer market leads to greater <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> and hence, greater profits. Therefore, companies that do not take the time to locate the cheapest inputs or the largest markets would not succeed, since their product costs more to produce and costs the consumer more.|$|E

2500|$|For years, {{the mode}} of {{collecting}} banknotes was through a handful of mail order dealers who issued [...] price lists and catalogs. In the early 1990s, it became more common for rare notes to be sold at various coin and currency shows via auction. The illustrated catalogs and [...] "event nature" [...] of the auction practice seemed to fuel a sharp rise in overall awareness of paper money in the numismatic community. The emergence of currency third party grading services (similar to services that grade and [...] "slab", or encapsulate, coins) also may have increased collector and investor interest in notes. Entire advanced collections are often sold at one time, {{and to this day}} single auctions can generate millions in gross sales. Today, eBay has surpassed auctions in terms of highest <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> of banknotes. However, rare banknotes still sell for much less than comparable rare coins. This disparity is diminishing as paper money prices continue to rise. A few rare and historical banknotes have sold for more than a million dollars.|$|E
