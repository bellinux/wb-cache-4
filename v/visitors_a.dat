5|$|Advertising for the {{permanent}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries in early 2015 was again shaped {{around a large}} digital-media push headed by its new advertising firm David. However, unlike the 2014 promotion that was almost exclusively digitally-oriented, the 2015 promotion was accompanied with a sizable television and media tie-in to the annual NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship tournament. In the host city of Indianapolis, Burger King sponsored Chicken Fries-branded SUVs that would give free rides to <b>visitors.</b> <b>A</b> series of advertisements for the product and the company's 2 for $5 sandwich promotion ran during the tournament featuring the hash tag WatchLikeaKing, along {{with a series of}} NCAA co-branded kid's meals.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses {{are popular}} birds for birdwatchers and their colonies are popular {{destinations}} for ecotourists. Regular birdwatching trips are {{taken out of}} many coastal towns and cities, like Monterey, Dunedin, Kaikoura, Wollongong, Sydney, Port Fairy, Hobart and Cape Town, to see pelagic seabirds. Albatrosses are easily attracted to these sightseeing boats by the deployment of fish oil and burley into the sea. Visits to colonies can be very popular: the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in Dunedin, New Zealand, attracts 40,000 <b>visitors</b> <b>a</b> year, and more isolated colonies are regular attractions on cruises to subantarctic islands.|$|E
5|$|Among the park's most {{distinctive}} and well-known features are the vehicular river crossings. At three places, crossing Pine Creek, fords were constructed instead of bridges. The fords offer <b>visitors</b> <b>a</b> chance to actually {{drive through the}} creek, though high water frequently closes the crossings. Hikers are relegated to pedestrian bridges or stepping stones in the creek to cross the stream. Floods are frequent enough on Pine Creek, a large watershed {{to the north of}} the park, that there is an emergency exit from the campground. When high water closes the fords, the campground is cut off and the emergency exit is the only way out.|$|E

5|$|Due to an asbestos-related {{concern for}} the safety of the buildings, the visitors' centre (including the planetarium) was mostly {{demolished}} in 2003 leaving a remnant of its far end; a large marquee was set up in its grounds. A new science centre was being planned at the time. Those rebuilding plans were shelved when Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST merged to become the University of Manchester in 2004, leaving the interim centre, which received around 70,000 <b>visitors</b> <b>a</b> year.|$|E
5|$|During the day, Luminosity {{performers}} do flash mobs, giving <b>visitors</b> <b>a</b> {{glimpse of}} the show. The stage for Luminosity is also used for a Peanuts show called Peanuts' Celebration at the Point. Carly Rae Jepsen held a concert on the Luminosity stage on July 7, 2012.

5|$|Goebbels was {{involved}} in planning the staging of the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin. It was around this time that he met and started {{having an affair with}} the actress Lída Baarová, whom he continued to see until 1938. A major project in 1937 was the Degenerate Art Exhibition, organised by Goebbels, which ran in Munich from July to November. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million <b>visitors.</b> <b>A</b> degenerate music exhibition took place the following year. Meanwhile, Goebbels was disappointed by the lack of quality in the National Socialist artwork, films, and literature.|$|E

5|$|Hampden Park {{has held}} four full rugby union {{international}} matches. The first was in 1906, when the Scottish Rugby Union chose {{to play their}} match against the touring South Africans at Hampden because no rugby ground could satisfy the demand to see the <b>visitors.</b> <b>A</b> crowd of over 30,000 saw Scotland win 6–0. The redeveloped Hampden served {{as one of the}} 1999 Rugby World Cup venues, over 90 years later. Scotland played Romania in a friendly match before the tournament and South Africa played Uruguay in a tournament pool match. The only rugby union international played at Hampden since then was in November 2004, between Scotland and Australia.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 the Art Association {{campaigned for}} a major retrospective, the Augustus Saint-Gaudens Memorial Exhibition, {{to be brought to}} Indianapolis. The exhibition, also {{referred}} to as the Saint-Gaudens Memorial Exhibition of Statuary, attracted 56,000 visitors during its three-month run, well beyond the board's goal of attracting 50,000 <b>visitors.</b> <b>A</b> 1937 exhibition, Dutch Paintings of the Seventeenth Century, included loans from the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. The six-week exhibition presented 65 pieces, including several Rembrandts, and was considered the beginning of the museum's rise to connoisseurship.|$|E
