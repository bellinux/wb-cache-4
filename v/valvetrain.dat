5|$|The Duesenberg Model A was {{the first}} {{automobile}} in series production to have hydraulic brakes and the first automobile in series production in the United States with a straight-eight engine. Officially known as the Duesenberg Straight Eight, the Model A was first shown in late 1920 in New York City. Production was delayed by substantial changes {{to the design of}} the car, including a change in the engine <b>valvetrain</b> from horizontal overhead valves to an overhead camshaft; also during this time, the company had moved its headquarters and factory from New Jersey to Indiana. The Model A was manufactured in Indianapolis, Indiana, from 1921 to 1925 by the Duesenberg Automobiles and Motors Company and from 1925 to 1926 at the same factory by the restructured Duesenberg Motor Company. The successors to the company began referring to the car as the Model A when the Model J was introduced.|$|E
25|$|Power: Because each {{cylinder}} on a {{radial engine}} {{has its own}} head, it is impractical to use a multivalve <b>valvetrain</b> on a radial engine. Therefore, almost all radial engines use a two valve pushrod-type <b>valvetrain</b> which may result in less power for a given displacement than multi-valve inline engines. The limitations of the poppet valve were largely overcome {{by the development of}} the sleeve valve, but at the cost of increased complexity, maintenance costs and reduced reliability.|$|E

25|$|The {{overhead}} camshaft design adds more <b>valvetrain</b> components that ultimately {{result in more}} complexity and higher manufacturing costs, but this is easily offset by many advantages over the older design: multi-valve design, higher RPM limit, and design freedom to better place valves, spark plugs (Spark-ignition engine), and intake/exhaust ports.|$|E
25|$|The rockers or cam {{followers}} sometimes incorporate {{a mechanism to}} adjust the valve lash through manual adjustment, but most modern auto engines have hydraulic lifters, eliminating the need to adjust the valve lash at regular intervals as the <b>valvetrain</b> wears, in particular the valves and valve seats in the combustion chamber.|$|E
500|$|The Duesenberg Straight Eight was {{introduced}} in late 1920 at the Commodore Hotel in New York City, but production of the Straight Eight did not begin until late 1921. [...] The main reason for the delay was Fred Duesenberg's decision to redesign several aspects of the car, including the <b>valvetrain.</b> The headquarters and manufacturing facilities of the Duesenberg Automobiles and Motors Company were relocated from Newark, New Jersey, to Indianapolis, Indiana during this time. The move was completed in May 1921, but the redesign was not.|$|E
50|$|With the 117 Coupé {{becoming}} {{a very popular}} and desired model, {{and the advent of}} the cooperation with General Motors, Isuzu decided to shift the model to mass production. This change took place in March 1973. Sales (in the Japanese domestic market) jumped accordingly, from 965 units in 1972 to 9506 units in 1974. The 1.8 L engine became standard, with several versions available, with or without fuel injection and with DOHC or SOHC <b>valvetrains.</b> Outputs dropped somewhat in October 1975, due to new stricter emissions regulations taking effect.|$|R
50|$|The Honda K series {{engine is}} a four-cylinder {{four-stroke}} engine introduced in 2001. The K series engines {{are equipped with}} DOHC <b>valvetrains</b> and use roller rockers to reduce friction. The engines use a coil-on-plug, distributorless ignition system with a coil for each spark plug. This system forgoes {{the use of a}} conventional distributor-based ignition timing system in favor of a computer-controlled system that allows the ECU to control ignition timings based on various sensor inputs. The cylinders have cast iron sleeves similar to the B-series & F-series engines, as opposed to the FRM cylinders found in the H-series and newer F series engines found only in the Honda S2000.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} <b>valvetrains</b> {{are present}} on this engine series. The L12A, L13A, and L15A use (i-DSI), or “intelligent Dual & Sequential Ignition”. i-DSI utilizes two spark plugs per cylinder which fire at different intervals during the combustion process {{to achieve a}} more complete burn of the gasoline. This process allows the engine to have more power while keeping fuel consumption low, thanks to the better gasoline utilization. Emissions are also reduced. The i-DSI engines have two to five valves per cylinder and a modest redline of only 6,000 rpm, but reach maximum torque at mid-range rpm, allowing for better performance without having {{to rev the engine}} at high speeds.|$|R
2500|$|In 1936, the 61E and 61EL {{models with}} the [...] "Knucklehead" [...] OHV engines was introduced. <b>Valvetrain</b> {{problems}} in early Knucklehead engines required a redesign halfway through {{its first year}} of production and retrofitting of the new <b>valvetrain</b> on earlier engines.|$|E

5000|$|The {{cars are}} powered by EFI V8 engines with {{compacted}} graphite iron blocks and pushrod <b>valvetrains</b> actuating two-valves per cylinder, and {{are limited to}} 358 cubic inches' (about 5.8 liters) displacement. However, modern technology has allowed power outputs near [...] in unrestricted form while retaining the conventional basic engine design. In fact, before NASCAR instituted the gear rule, Cup engines were capable of operating more than 10,000 rpm. A NASCAR Cup Series engine with the maximum bore of 4.185 inches (106.3 millimeters) and stroke of 3.25 inches (82.55 millimeters) at 9,000 rpm has a mean piston speed of 80.44 fps (24.75 m/s) (roughly that of a Formula One engine). Contemporary Cup engines run 9,800 rpm, 87.59 fps (26.95 m/s), at the road course events on Pocono Pennsylvania's long front stretch and at the [...]526-mile short-track Martinsville Speedway. At the backbone 1.5- to 2.0-mile tri-oval tracks of NASCAR, the engines produce over 850 hp running 92-9400 rpm for 500 miles, 600 mi for the Coca-Cola 600 Charlotte race.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Timing {{drive systems}} of recent {{passenger}} car engines are usually equipped with chain or synchronous belt drives. The comparatively low stiffness of chains and belts, {{combined with the}} large moments of inertia, resulting from moving parts of camshafts and <b>valvetrains,</b> lead to natural frequencies in the frequency range between 80 and 250 Hz for the entire timing drive [1]. Obviously, engine orders dominating the noise excitation {{are in the same}} frequency range, and resonance effects cannot be avoided. Furthermore, a guarantee is requested that occurring vibration amplitudes do not exceed acceptable limits. Hence, the predicted results of the primary dynamics of the timing drive are key data for the design analysis of a combustion engine. Besides the low frequency range excitation determined by main engine orders, higher-order structure-borne noise excitation is gaining more importance. This is particularly true for chain-driven systems where specic effects lead to considerable excitation of the engine structure in a higher frequency range (typical whine noise). The excitations are caused by the polygon effect, meshing impacts between chain links and sprockets and impacts in the engagement and disengagement between chain, sprockets and guides. This paper presents a comprehensive multi-body dynamics (MBD) model and the relevant simulation environment, which takes into account the entire timing drive as a fully coupled system. While simple MBD models (e. g. longitudinal span representation) are sufcient for the prediction of the primary dynamics of th...|$|R
5000|$|The {{desmodromic}} system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to overcome the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass and all of the valve spring retainer mass. However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms per valve, so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use roller tappets in conventional <b>valvetrains,</b> although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate hydraulic valve lash adjusters in a desmodromic system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as valve lash is typically set using a shim under a cam follower.|$|R

2500|$|The Board brought Vincent and Hall {{together}} on 29 May 1917 at the Willard Hotel in Washington, {{where the two}} were asked to stay until they produced a set of basic drawings. [...] After just five days, Vincent and Hall left the Willard with a completed design for the new engine, which had adopted, almost unchanged, the single overhead camshaft and rocker arm <b>valvetrain</b> design of the later Mercedes D.IIIa engines of 1917-18.|$|E
2500|$|Features of the Austro-Daimler {{included}} {{welded steel}} water jackets, (originally copper), seven main bearings and large diameter inclined inlet and exhaust valves opened by dual action push-pull rods and closed by spring pressure. The single-overhead cam <b>valvetrain</b> was driven from the crankshaft through the usual vertically-oriented shaft as the contemporary Mercedes D.III was, but the Austro-Daimler had its vertical camshaft drive system mounted {{at the front}} of the engine instead, and not the usual aft-end placement of other Central Powers straight-six [...] "SOHC" [...] liquid-cooled aircraft powerplants, like the Mercedes and BMW designs.|$|E
5000|$|Ford {{produced}} an engine with two overhead cams (one cam per head) and hemispherical chambers in the mid-1960s. The engine, displacing 425 cubic inches and {{belonging to the}} FE family of Ford engines, {{was known as the}} [...] "427 SOHC"; it was also known as the Cammer. It was basically a set of SOHC hemi heads that bolted onto Ford's FE engine block. The 1964 engine was designed in 90 days of intensive engineering effort for use in racing. The 427 SOHC used the side oiler engine block modified slightly to deal with the missing in-block cam among other OHC issues. Because of their power levels, and the fact that Chrysler had showed Bill France that a DOHC 426 Hemi was in the works, it was banned from NASCAR races, though allowed in certain drag racing classes. After the NASCAR ban, Ford continued to produce the SOHC, selling it over the counter to racers and others who used it to power many altered-wheelbase A/FX Mustangs and supercharged Top Fuel dragsters. Connie Kalitta, Pete Robinson, and [...] "Snake" [...] Prudhomme all used the engine in their Top Fuel racers. In 1967 Connie Kalitta's SOHC-powered [...] "Bounty Hunter" [...] won Top Fuel honors at AHRA, NHRA and NASCAR winter meets, becoming the only [...] "triple crown" [...] winner in drag racing history. Dynamometer results of the day showed the SOHC Hemi producing almost 700 hp (522 kW) in crate form (100 hp per liter). The overhead cams meant that it was not as rpm-limited as the Chrysler Hemis were with their pushrods and heavy and complex <b>valvetrains.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Despite the low {{demand for}} luxury {{motorcycles}} during the Great Depression, Indian not only continued {{production of the}} Four, but continued to develop the motorcycle. One of the less popular versions of the Four was the [...] "upside down" [...] engine on the 1936-37 models. While earlier (and later) Fours had inlet-over-exhaust (IOE) cylinder heads with overhead inlet valves and side exhaust valves, the 1936-1937 Indian Four had a unique EOI cylinder head, with the positions reversed. In theory, this would improve fuel vaporization, and the new engine was more powerful. However, the new system made the cylinder head, and the rider's inseam, very hot. This, along with an exhaust <b>valvetrain</b> that required frequent adjustment, caused sales to drop. The addition of dual carburetors in 1937 did not revive interest. The design was returned to the original configuration in 1938.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were three}} major {{variants}} of the SR20DE {{used in the}} G20. The first, used from July 1990 to December 1993, was the highport, in which the injectors and fuel rail were located above the intake plenum. In January 1994, due to tightening emissions restrictions, Nissan switched to a lowport design, in which the injectors and fuel rail switched places with the intake plenum. This design also featured a milder intake camshaft. (Switching it out for the highport intake cam is a popular upgrade to gain more power.) [...] This design was used from 1994 to 1996 and again in 1998. In 1999 Nissan replaced the <b>valvetrain</b> with a roller-rocker arm lifter design {{in place of the}} hydraulic rocker arm previously used, but kept the lowport intake design; many performance parts are not interchangeable between roller-rocker and highport/lowport engines, most notably camshafts.|$|E
2500|$|Development {{of the new}} 20 litre {{engine was}} led by Henry Royce {{from his home in}} Kent. Based {{initially}} on the 7.4 litre 40/50 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost engine, and drawing also on the design of a 7.2 litre Daimler DF80 aero engine used in a 1913 Grand Prix Mercedes that had been acquired, the power was increased by doubling the number of cylinders to twelve and increasing their stroke to 6.5inches, although their bore remained at 4.5inches of the 40/50. The engine was also run faster, and an epicyclic reduction gear was designed to keep the propeller speed below 1,100 rpm. To reduce inertia and improve performance the <b>valvetrain</b> design was changed from sidevalves to a SOHC design, closely following the original [...] "side-slot" [...] rocker arm design philosophy used on the contemporary German Mercedes D.I, Mercedes D.II and Mercedes D.III straight-six aviation powerplants.|$|E
2500|$|Sliding {{friction}} between {{the surface of the}} cam and the cam follower which rides upon it can be considerable. In order to reduce wear at this point, the cam and follower are both surface hardened, and modern lubricant motor oils contain additives specifically to reduce sliding friction. The lobes of the camshaft are usually slightly tapered and the faces of the valve lifters slightly domed, causing the lifters to rotate to distribute wear on the parts. The surfaces of the cam and follower are designed to [...] "wear in" [...] together, and therefore each follower should stay with its original cam lobe and never be moved to a different lobe. You can put new lifters on an old cam but never old lifters on a new cam. In some engines the followers have rollers which eliminate the sliding friction and wear but add mass to the <b>valvetrain.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, the ZR-1 {{and base}} model {{received}} updates to body work, interior, and wheels. The rear convex fascia {{that set the}} 1990 ZR-1 apart from the base model {{found its way to}} all models, making the high-priced ZR-1 even less distinguishable. Further changes were made in 1992, including extra ZR-1 badges on the fenders and the introduction of Acceleration Slip Regulation (ASR) or traction control. For model year 1993, Lotus design modifications were made to the cylinder heads, exhaust system and <b>valvetrain</b> of the LT5, bringing horsepower up from 375 to 405. In addition, a new exhaust gas recirculation system improved emissions control. [...] The model remained nearly unchanged into the 1995 model year, after which the ZR-1 was discontinued as the result of waning interest, development of the LS series engines, cost and the coming of the C5 generation. A total of 6,939 ZR-1s were manufactured over the six-year period. Not until the debut of the C5 platform Z06 in 2001 would Chevrolet have another production Corvette capable of matching the ZR-1's performance.|$|E

50|$|They have a DOHC <b>valvetrain</b> {{configuration}} with hydraulic tappets, driving four valves per cylinder. Exceptions are the 1.4 12V unit, {{also with}} hydraulic tappets but a SOHC <b>valvetrain,</b> driving three valves per cylinder, and the 1.9 8V and 2.4 10V turbodiesels, with a SOHC <b>valvetrain</b> with mechanical tappets, driving two valves per cylinder. Some versions have {{variable valve timing}} (VVT). The camshafts are toothed belt-driven. The 1750 TBi gasoline and 16V Multijet diesel engines feature hydraulic tappets with roller rocker arms.|$|E
50|$|Typical normal-service engine valve-train {{components}} {{may be too}} lightweight {{for operating}} at high revolutions per minute (RPM), leading to valve float. This occurs when {{the action of the}} valve no longer completely opens or closes, such as when the valve spring force is insufficient to close the valve (it does not fully rest on its seat even though the cam would allow the valve to close) causing a loss of control of the <b>valvetrain,</b> as well as a drop in power output. Valve float will damage the <b>valvetrain</b> over time, and could cause the valve to be damaged as it is still partially open while the piston comes to the top of its stroke. Upgrading to high pressure valve springs could allow higher <b>valvetrain</b> speeds, but this would also overload the <b>valvetrain</b> components and cause excessive and costly wear.|$|E

50|$|High-output and engines used in {{competition}} feature camshafts and <b>valvetrain</b> components {{that are designed}} to withstand higher RPM ranges.

50|$|Valve float {{can also}} be {{prevented}} by using lighter <b>valvetrain</b> components. Titanium valves, retainers, and pushrods are commonly used for this purpose.
