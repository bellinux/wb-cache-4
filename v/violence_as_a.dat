5|$|Progress {{remained}} slow through 1991 and 1992. A cabinet {{set up in}} October 1991 contained {{almost no}} opposition at all, and the administrative hierarchy across the country only recognised the authority of Habyarimana's MRND party. The regime frequently used <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tool to hamper reform, justifying its actions as anti-RPF security measures.|$|E
5|$|In his {{theoretical}} writings, particularly Imperialism, Lenin discussed what {{he regarded}} as developments in capitalism since Marx's death; in his view, it {{had reached a}} new stage, state monopoly capitalism. He also believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, that monopoly capitalism existed in Russia meant {{that the country was}} sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism. Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism, and distinguished itself by the emotional intensity of its liberationist vision. It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution, and elevated the role of <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> revolutionary instrument.|$|E

5|$|The main {{goals of}} the terror was to destroy the power {{structure}} of the enemy, clear and secure the areas governed and occupied by the armies. Another goal was to create shock and fear among the civil population and the enemy soldiers. In the Finnish case, the common troopers' paramilitary nature and lack of combat skills, led to use political <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> military weapon. The terror achieved some of the objectives, but also gave additional motivation to fight against an enemy perceived to be inhuman and cruel. The Red and White propaganda utilized the acts of the opponent effectively, which increased the local killings and the spiral of revenge.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{theme of}} the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to {{socialism}} by education, not by force. The defense claimed {{that most of the}} prosecution's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre-dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, after which the CPUSA rejected <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means of change. Starobin, p 207. The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence. Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced. As a result, the defense complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their belief system to the jury.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the late Republic, {{formerly}} authoritative institutions lost their credibility and authority. For example, the Sullan reforms to the Senate strongly split the aristocratic class between those who stayed in the city and those who rose to high office abroad, further increasing class divides between Romans, even at the highest levels. Furthermore, the dominance of the military in the late Republic, along with stronger ties between a general and his troops, caused by their longer terms of service together and the troops' reliance on that general to provide for their retirements, along with an obstructionist central government, meant a huge number of malcontent soldiers willing to take up arms against the state. Adding in the institutionalisation of <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means to obstruct or force political change (e.g. the deaths of the Gracchi and Sulla's dictatorship, respectively), the Republic was caught in an ever more violent and anarchic struggle between the Senate, assemblies at Rome, and the promagistrates. It would only be resolved by civil war, a war which the promagistrate governors and their troops would win, and in doing so, collapse the Republic.|$|E

40|$|Construction of Christian {{identity}} in Egypt proceeded in pace with {{construction of the}} Egyptian pagan “Other” between the second and sixth centuries. Apologies, martyrdoms, apocalypses, histories, sermons, hagiographies, and magical texts provide several different vantage points from which to view the Christian construction of the Egyptian pagan “Other”: as the agent of anti-Christian <b>violence,</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> intellectual rival, <b>as</b> <b>an</b> object of anti-pagan <b>violence,</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> obstacle to salvation, and—perhaps most dangerously—as but another participant in a shared religious experience. The recent work of social scientists on identity, deviance, violence, social/cultural memory, and religiosity provides insight into the strategies by which construction of the “Other” {{was part of a}} larger project of fashioning a “proper” Christian religious domain...|$|R
40|$|AbstractElevated T 3 {{levels have}} been {{reported}} in men with antisocial behavior. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the relationship between thyroid hormones and expressed adult interpersonal violence in female patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Furthermore, expressed adult interpersonal violence in female BPD patients was compared to healthy female controls. A total of 92 clinically euthyroid women with BPD and 57 healthy women were assessed with the Karolinska Interpersonal Violence Scales (KIVS). Baseline thyroid function was evaluated by measuring plasma free and bound triiodothyronine (FT 3 and T 3), thyroxine (FT 4 and T 4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with immunoassays in patients. Plasma cortisol was also measured. Among females with BPD, expressed interpersonal <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> adult showed a significant positive correlation with the T 3 levels. The mean expression of interpersonal <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> adult was significantly higher in BPD patients as compared to healthy controls. The multiple regression model indicated that two independent predictors of KIVS expressed interpersonal <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> adult: T 3 and comorbid diagnosis of alcohol abuse. Association between T 3 levels and violent/aggressive behavior earlier reported exclusively in male samples may be valid also in females with BPD...|$|R
5|$|The above {{passage from}} Mahabharata emphasises the {{cardinal}} importance of Ahimsa in Hinduism, and literally means: Ahimsa {{is the highest}} virtue, Ahimsa is the highest self-control, Ahimsa is the greatest gift, Ahimsa is the best suffering, Ahimsa is the highest sacrifice, Ahimsa is the finest strength, Ahimsa is the greatest friend, Ahimsa is the greatest happiness, Ahimsa is the highest truth, and Ahimsa is the greatest teaching. Some other examples where the phrase Ahimsa Paramo Dharma are discussed include Adi Parva, Vana Parva and Anushasana Parva. The Bhagavad Gita, among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. These verses develop the concepts of lawful violence in self-defence and the theories of just war. However, {{there is no consensus}} on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about non-violence and lawful <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, when he or she faces moral questions.|$|E

30|$|For example, Buss (2009) {{shows how}} the {{conceptualisation}} of sexual <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ‘instrument of genocide’ in Rwanda renders invisible victims other than Tutsi women, such as women and men of Hutu or Twa 3 ethnicities. In a similar vein, the weapon of war explanation explains sexual <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> instrument used by armed combatants, causing violence perpetrated by civilians, such as intimate partners (see, for example, Clark et al. 2010; Freedman 2011; Tayler-Smith et al. 2012) to ‘disappear’. Likewise, sexual violence acts committed by UN or African Union (AU) peacekeepers; personnel deployed on UN operations; experts on mission (including military observers); UN volunteers; and contractors, consultants, and police units (see, for example, Burke 2014) become exempted from critical enquiry—let alone sexual violence among humanitarians (see, for example, Norbert 2015 a, b).|$|R

25|$|Societal norms {{around the}} use of <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means to achieve {{objectives}} have been strongly associated with the prevalence of rape.
