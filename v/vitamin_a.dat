40|$|Arterial {{stiffness}} {{is associated}} with cardiovascular risk, morbidity, and mortality. The present paper reviews the main vitamins related to arterial stiffness and enabling destiffening, their mechanisms of action, providing {{a brief description of}} the latest studies in the area, and their implications for primary cardiovascular prevention, clinical practice, and therapy. Despite inconsistent evidence for destiffening induced by vitamin supplementation in several randomized clinical trials, positive results were obtained in specific populations. The main mechanisms are related to antiatherogenic effects, improvement of endothelial function (<b>vitamins</b> <b>A,</b> C, D, and E) and metabolic profile (<b>vitamins</b> <b>A,</b> B 12, C, D, and K), inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (vitamin D), anti-inflammatory (<b>vitamins</b> <b>A,</b> D, E, and K) and antioxidant effects (<b>vitamins</b> <b>A,</b> C, and E), decrease of homocysteine level (vitamin B 12), and reversing calcification of arteries (<b>vitamin</b> K). <b>Vitamins</b> <b>A,</b> B 12, C, D, E, and K status is important in evaluating cardiovascular risk, and vitamin supplementation may be an effective, individualized, and inexpensive destiffening therapy...|$|R

5|$|In 1930, Paul Karrer elucidated {{the correct}} {{structure}} for beta-carotene, the main precursor of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A,</b> and identified other carotenoids. Karrer and Norman Haworth confirmed Albert Szent-Györgyi's discovery of ascorbic acid and {{made significant contributions}} to the chemistry of flavins, which led to the identification of lactoflavin. For their investigations on carotenoids, flavins and vitamins A and B2, they both received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937.|$|E
40|$|The fluoxetine, commercially named Prozac, is {{efficient}} against {{depression and}} anxiety, with {{lower risk of}} collateral effects. However, the possible genotoxic effects are still unknown. The use of vitamins as protectors against damages on cells and DNA has been evaluated, mainly for <b>vitamins</b> <b>A</b> and C. Furthermore, the associative effect of vitamins with several medicines demands studies. The evaluations of genotoxic effect of Prozac and <b>vitamins</b> <b>A</b> and C protective effect were carried out in culture of Chinese hamster ovary cells, CHO-K 1, {{by means of the}} comet test. The Prozac was used, in liquid formulation, diluted in 5 µg, 1 µg and 0. 2 µg/mL of culture medium. The vitamins were used, in liquid formulation, at the concentrations of 3 µg and 880, 5 µg/mL of culture medium to <b>vitamins</b> <b>A</b> and C, respectively. The treatments were carried out during 1 hour. The obtained data demonstrated that only the highest concentration of Prozac (5 µg) is genotoxic and both <b>vitamins</b> <b>A</b> and C reduced such genotoxicity. The data suggest a follow-up on patients who use Prozac and the possibility of <b>vitamins</b> <b>A</b> and C association in order to minimize the collateral genotoxic effects...|$|R

5|$|Retinoids are {{medications}} which reduce inflammation, normalize the {{follicle cell}} life cycle, and reduce sebum production. They are structurally related to <b>vitamin</b> <b>A.</b> The retinoids appear {{to influence the}} cell life cycle in the follicle lining. This helps prevent the accumulation of skin cells within the hair follicle that can create a blockage. They are a first-line acne treatment, especially for people with dark-colored skin, and are known to lead to faster improvement of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.|$|E

5|$|The {{value of}} eating a certain food to {{maintain}} health was recognized long before vitamins were identified. The ancient Egyptians knew that feeding liver {{to a person}} may help with night blindness, an illness now known {{to be caused by}} a <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> deficiency. The advancement of ocean voyages during the Renaissance resulted in prolonged periods without access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and made illnesses from vitamin deficiency common among ships' crews.|$|E

Oxidative stress can be considered as either a cause or consequence of some diseases, an area of research stimulating drug development for antioxidant compounds for use as potential therapies.|$|E
5|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, <b>vitamin</b> <b>A,</b> lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine relative iron absorption from reduced iron-fortified Corn Flakes and the role of <b>vitamins</b> <b>A</b> and C improving absorption. The protocol included 87 subjects who received 4 meals composed of cereal, milk and sugar. Iron and different concentrations and combinations of <b>vitamins</b> <b>A</b> and C were added. Iron absorption was measured calculating radioactive iron incorporation into the blood of subjects. There was a significant 3. 6 -times increase in iron absorption when both vitamins were administered together. In vitro solubility tests with ferric chloride, electrolytic and reduced irons showed an important role of <b>vitamins</b> <b>A</b> and C enhancing iron solubility at pH 6 to the values found at pH 2. Addition of <b>vitamins</b> <b>A</b> and C to a ready-to-eat cereal significantly improves iron absorption by a process at least partially due, to the solubilyzing effect of these vitamins on reduced iron. Addition of both vitamins in the same meal produced an increment in absorption corresponding to the additive factor of each vitamin. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Frequently used topical retinoids include adapalene, isotretinoin, retinol, tazarotene, and tretinoin. They often {{cause an}} initial {{flare-up}} of acne and facial flushing, {{and can cause}} significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night. Tretinoin is the least expensive of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene is the least irritating to the skin but costs significantly more. Tazarotene {{is the most effective}} and expensive topical retinoid, but is not as well-tolerated. Retinol is a form of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> that has similar but milder effects, and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.|$|E
5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension {{is a condition}} of unknown cause characterised by a rise in CSF pressure. It is associated with headaches, double vision, difficulties seeing, and a swollen optic disc. It can occur {{in association with the}} use of <b>Vitamin</b> <b>A</b> and tetracycline antibiotics, or without any identifiable cause at all, particularly in younger obese women. Management may include ceasing any known causes, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide, repeated drainage via lumbar puncture, or the insertion of a shunt such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.|$|E
5|$|In {{those who}} are {{otherwise}} healthy, {{there is little evidence}} that supplements have any benefits with respect to cancer or heart disease. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>A</b> and E supplements not only provide no health benefits for generally healthy individuals, but they may increase mortality, though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for whom it was already known that beta-carotene supplements can be harmful. While other findings suggest that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess.|$|E

5|$|Nonpolar {{antioxidants}} such as eugenol—a {{major component}} of oil of cloves—have toxicity limits that can be exceeded with the misuse of undiluted essential oils. Toxicity associated with high doses of water-soluble antioxidants such as ascorbic acid are less of a concern, as these compounds can be excreted rapidly in urine. More seriously, very high doses of some antioxidants may have harmful long-term effects. The beta-carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) study of lung cancer patients found that smokers given supplements containing beta-carotene and <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> had increased rates of lung cancer. Subsequent studies confirmed these adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Mawson and Mertz's {{illnesses}} remains {{in part a}} mystery. At the time, McLean—the expedition's chief surgeon {{and one of the}} men who had remained at Cape Denison—attributed their sickness to colitis; Mawson wrote in The Home of the Blizzard, his official account of the expedition, that Mertz died of fever and appendicitis. A 1969 study by Sir John Cleland and R. V. Southcott of the University of Adelaide concluded that the symptoms Mawson described—hair, skin and weight loss, depression, dysentery and persistent skin infections—indicated the men had suffered hypervitaminosis A, an excessive intake of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A.</b> This is found in unusually high quantities in the livers of Greenland Huskies, of which both Mertz and Mawson consumed large amounts.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} use of supplemental <b>vitamin</b> <b>A,</b> vitamin C, vitamin D or vitamin E does not {{reduce the risk}} of lung cancer. Some studies suggest that people who eat diets with a higher proportion of vegetables and fruit tend to have a lower risk, but {{this may be due to}} confounding—with the lower risk actually due to the association of a high fruit/vegetables diet with less smoking. Several rigorous studies have not demonstrated a clear association between diet and lung cancer risk, although meta-analysis that accounts for smoking status may show benefit from a healthy diet.|$|E
