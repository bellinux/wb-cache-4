50|$|<b>Vibrating</b> <b>tables</b> or shake {{tables are}} {{sometimes}} {{used to test}} products to determine or demonstrate their ability to withstand vibration. Testing of this type is commonly done in the automotive, aerospace, and defense industries. These machines are capable of producing three different types of vibration profile sine sweep, random vibration, and synthesized shock. In {{all three of these}} applications, the part under test will typically be instrumented with one or more accelerometers to measure component response to the vibration input. A sine sweep vibration profile typically starts vibrating at low frequency and increases in frequency at a set rate (measured in hertz per second or hertz per minute). The vibratory amplitude as measured in gs may increase or decrease as well. A sine sweep will find resonant frequencies in the part. A random vibration profile will excite different frequencies along a spectrum at different times. Significant calculation goes into making sure that all frequencies get excited to within an acceptable tolerance band. A random vibration test suite may range anywhere from 30 seconds up to several hours. It is intended to synthesize the effect of, for example, a car driving over rough terrain or a rocket taking off. A synthesized shock pulse is a short duration high level vibration calculated as a sum of many half-sine waves covering a range of frequencies. It is intended to simulate the effects of an impact or explosion. A shock pulse test typically lasts less than a second. <b>Vibrating</b> <b>tables</b> can also be used in the packaging process in material handling industries to shake or settle a container so it can hold more product.|$|R

Water provided the motive power in the mill. Smelting and refining remained labour-intensive and costly. In 1903 {{the decision was made to}} stop separating the silver and to sell argentiferous lead to a smelting company. This created an overall saving of 14shillings per ton of lead sold, roughly £750 per year. With labour shortages during World WarI and reduced ore production, it was decided to cease smelting altogether in 1917 and sell the lead concentrates.|$|R

Even though the peninsular has not been seriously affected by any earthquake, some Northern areas were quite badly engulfed by the Tsunami of 2004.

40|$|In several {{industrial}} sectors, some {{components are}} subjected to mechanical vibrations which {{may lead to a}} premature failure. To ensure that they operate properly during their service life, the utilization of qualification tests has been consolidated over the years. It is often required to carry out accelerated tests for obvious reasons as feasibility and cost: the aim is to limit the duration of tests. The Test Tailoring procedure requires an appropriate definition for vibratory test profiles to be utilized as an excitation in terms of motion generated by <b>vibrating</b> <b>tables</b> or shakers. The synthesis of such profiles requires that signals be measured in real environments and then that their most important characteristics be reproduced in a laboratory, in particular their spectral content and damage potential. The conventional procedures permit the synthesis of an accelerated test profile in terms of a Power Spectral Density, which is characterized by a Gaussian distribution of the corresponding timeseries values. Such a kind of synthesis might be unfit to represent the real environment signal taken as a reference, owing to the latter’s usual non-Gaussianity. As a consequence, reliability could be compromised since the “nature” of the real signal is not preserved. Typical examples of non-Gaussian signals coming forth in real applications are the so-called Leptokurtic signals, whose high amplitude peaks originate a strongly non Gaussian probability distribution. A parameter called kurtosis is often employed to represent the number and severity of the peaks of the signal. A common reference is made to “kurtosis control” whenever it is required that the synthesized and the measured signal have not only the same spectral content but the same kurtosis value as well. In this work some novel Mission Synthesis algorithms are proposed, which generate test profiles by controlling precisely the kurtosis value and complying with the spectral content of the reference signal...|$|R

Perhaps the most interesting solutions are P_∞,m solutions (where m is finite). These arise from sticking events in which the time between impacts approaches zero in finite time. The convergence properties of the impact time sequence during a sticking event is shown to be controlled by the coefficient of restitution of the impact law.

40|$|Purpose. One of the {{efficient}} ways to obtain castings of complex shape is lost foam casting (LFC) in the evacuated molds (containers). Upgrading {{the quality of}} this casting method requires improvement of molding techniques. The molding process involves layer-by-layer vibratory compaction of sand in the containers. Most of the lines of LFC sections are equipped with vibrating tables with inertia oscillators driven by induction motors, operating at nominal speed. A promising way of improving the molding technique is the rational setting of the following parameters of vibrating table: vibration displacement, velocity and acceleration. These parameters {{are determined by the}} elastic-mass characteristics of the system «vibrating table – mold» and perturbing forces created by inertia oscillators. The aim of the study is to determine the rational range of setting the parameters of oscillators at which the qualitative layer-by-layer compaction of the molding sand in the mold takes place. Methodology. The efficiency criterion for setting characteristics of the <b>vibrating</b> <b>table</b> there were taken the values of averaged accelerations of 6. 5 – 7. 5 m/s 2 corresponding to maximum compaction degree of dry molding sand and the range of acceleration values 9 – 9. 5 m/s 2 for giving the sand «pseudo-yielding». For the study it was developed a mathematical model of oscillations of the movable part of <b>vibrating</b> <b>table</b> with two types of casting containers for steady and transient operation modes. Findings. In the process of research of the mold oscillations it was calculated the natural frequencies of oscillations at different elastic-mass characteristics of the system using a mathematical model. It was constructed the frequency response of displacements and accelerations of the moving part of the table with container filled with molding sand layer-by-layer. Originality. The author proposes a method of determining the range of frequency setting of inertial oscillators of table, which make it possible to obtain qualitative compaction of dry molding sand in the mold. Practical value. In the process of molding using the lost foam casting models the mold mass is increasing due to the layer-by-layer filling of the mold with molding sand. The change of mass characteristics of the mold requires operational change of the kinematic characteristics of the <b>vibrating</b> <b>table</b> – vibration acceleration.
