5|$|YouTube {{allows users}} to upload, view, rate, share, add to favorites, report, comment on <b>videos,</b> and {{subscribe}} to other users. It offers {{a wide variety of}} user-generated and corporate media <b>videos.</b> Available content includes video clips, TV show clips, music <b>videos,</b> short and documentary films, audio recordings, movie trailers, live streams, and other content such as video blogging, short original <b>videos,</b> and educational <b>videos.</b> Most of the content on YouTube is uploaded by individuals, but media corporations including CBS, the BBC, Vevo, and Hulu offer some of their material via YouTube as part of the YouTube partnership program. Unregistered users can only watch <b>videos</b> on the site, while registered users are permitted to upload an unlimited number of <b>videos</b> and add comments to <b>videos.</b> <b>Videos</b> deemed potentially inappropriate are available only to registered users affirming themselves to be at least 18 years old.|$|E

Users {{who have a}} good track record of {{complying}} with the site's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload <b>videos</b> up to 12 hours in length, as well as live streams, which requires verifying the account, normally through a mobile phone. When YouTube was launched in 2005, {{it was possible to}} upload longer <b>videos,</b> but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of <b>videos</b> exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films. The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010. In the past, it was possible to upload <b>videos</b> longer than 12 hours. <b>Videos</b> can be at most 128 GB in size. Video captions are made using speech recognition technology when uploaded. Such captioning is usually not perfectly accurate, so YouTube provides several options for manually entering the captions for greater accuracy.|$|E

The YouTube site had a page that allowed supported browsers to opt into the HTML5 trial.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new data model called algebraic <b>video</b> that provides operations for the composition, search, navigation and playback of digital <b>video</b> presentations. <b>Video</b> presentations are composed using a <b>video</b> algebra that consists {{of a set of}} basic operations on <b>video</b> segments to produce a desired <b>video</b> stream.

40|$|These Real-time <b>video</b> {{streaming}} over networks operates under stringent network resource constraints, {{with multiple}} <b>video</b> clients competing for limited network resources.

We propose a classification-based approach for multi-client <b>video</b> transmission over heterogeneous networks (CMVT). Firstly, the <b>video</b> server detects the available bandwidth of multiple <b>video</b> clients and classifies the clients into different classes. Secondly, the limited export bandwidth of the server is allocated to different <b>video</b> clients using the client classification results and greedy algorithm. Finally, the <b>video</b> server transmits <b>video</b> streams to <b>video</b> clients in different classes through Unicast and clients in the same class through Unicast and forwarding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed <b>video</b> transmission method can use the network bandwidth efficiently and provide better <b>video</b> quality to more <b>video</b> client...|$|R
