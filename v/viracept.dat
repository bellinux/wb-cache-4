40|$|Many {{firms in}} the {{biotechnology}} industry have significant valuations despite having no product revenue because their products are in early stages of development. In the past ten to fifteen years investors have bid up the stock prices of firms showing promise of developing a blockbuster drug. Using the decision-tree and binomial-lattice methods we compare {{the value of a}} biotechnology firm to the sum of the values of its drug development project. We compare our computed values of Agouron to actual market values at selected point in time during the development of <b>Viracept</b> a drug used to treat HIV-positive patients. Values for Agouron were also found using a binomial lattice {{with the addition of a}} growth option, which was added because the development of an initial new molecular entity (NME) is similar to purchasing a call option on the value of a subsequent NME...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} two decades the promise of structure-based drug design has {{continued}} to attract significant interest from the pharmaceutical industry. The initial wave of enthusiasm in the late eighties resulted in some notable successes, for example, the crystal structures of HIV protease and influenza neuraminidase were used to design <b>Viracept</b> and Relenza, both drugs currently used in anti-viral therapy (1, 2). However, although structure-based design methods continued to be developed, the approach became largely eclipsed in the early nineties by other technologies such as combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening (HTS) which seemed to offer a more effective approach for drug discovery. The goal of obtaining a crystal structure of the target protein, particularly in complex with lead compounds was regarded as a resource-intensive, unpredictable and slow process. During that period it was clear that protein crystallography was unable {{to keep pace with the}} other drug discovery technologies being performed in a high-throughput mode. More recently, there has been resurgence in interest for using structure-based approaches driven largely by major technology developments in protein crystallography that have resulted in crystal structures for many of today’s therapeutic targets. Furthermore, the ability to rapidly obtain crystal structures of a target protein in complex with small molecules is driving a new wave of structure-based drug design. In this chapter I will briefly describe some of these technology developments and focus on how they have enabled high-throughput X-ray crystallography to b...|$|E
40|$|Pharmaceutical drug {{discovery}} is increasingly focusing attention on structural genomics to improve target identification, rational drug design, and basic proteomic research. Large-scale structural genomics requires automated, parallel crystallization procedures to optimize crystal growth. This paper describes a protein crystallization workstation developed for hanging drop and sitting drop crystallization methods. Key Words Structural genomics, protein crystallization, sitting drop, hanging drop, laboratory automation, liquid handling, automated imaging The study of proteomics is an immense {{challenge to the}} research community due to the scale, intricacy, and technical complexity of protein chemistry. The human proteome is much larger and more complicated than the genome, given the prevalence of alternative splicing and protein modification. Proteomics {{will lead to the}} definition of these protein species and to their modification, regulation, function, localization, and structure, and is expected to {{have a significant impact on}} {{drug discovery}} pipelines. Structural genomics will be critical in proteomic studies, not only for the elucidation of corresponding protein structures, but also for deriving protein function through structural homologies and the development of improved in silico methods for protein–ligand binding and rational drug design. Improvements in protein–ligand models, target discovery, and drug design will ultimately decrease the development time and cost for novel drugs while improving drug efficacy and specificity. Structural genomics is an information-rich field, which is becoming capable of high-throughput performance as a result of improvements in crystallization technique and automation. High-throughput protein crystallization plays a major role in pharmaceutical proteomics research, as it shifts from its former limited use in lead optimization to a larger role in lead generation. 1 The validity of the structural genomics approach to drug discovery was demonstrated by the production of <b>Viracept</b> (Agouron Pharmaceuticals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Roche's {{protease}} inhibitor nelfinavir mesylate (<b>Viracept</b> ®) produced between March 2007 -June 2007 {{was found to}} contain elevated levels of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), a known mutagen (alkylator) – leading to a global recall of the drug. EMS levels in a daily dose (2, 500 mg Viracept/day) were predicted not to exceed a dose of ~ 2. 75 mg/day (~ 0. 055 mg/kg/day based on 50 kg patient). As existing toxicology data on EMS did not permit an adequate patient risk assessment, a comprehensive animal toxicology evaluation of EMS was conducted. General toxicity of EMS was investigated in rats over 28 days. Two studies for DNA damage were performed in mice; chromosomal damage was assessed using a micronucleus assay and gene mutations were detected using the MutaMouse transgenic model. In addition, experiments designed to extrapolate animal exposure to humans were undertaken. A general toxicity study showed that the toxicity of EMS occurred only at doses ≥ 60 mg/kg/day, which is far above that received by patients. Studies for chromosomal damage and mutations in mice demonstrated a clear threshold effect with EMS at 25 mg/kg/day, under chronic dosing conditions. Exposure analysis (C max) demonstrated that ~ 370 -fold higher levels of EMS than that ingested by patients, are needed to saturate known, highly conserved, error-free, mammalian DNA repair mechanisms for alkylation. In summary, animal studies suggested that patients who took nelfinavir mesylate with elevated levels of EMS are at no increased risk for carcinogenicity or teratogenicity over their background risk, since mutations are prerequisites for such downstream events. These findings are potentially relevant to > 40 marketed drugs that are mesylate salts. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nelfinavir mesylate (<b>Viracept,</b> {{formally}} AG 1343) is {{a potent}} and orally bioavailable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV- 1) protease inhibitor (Ki = 2 nM) and is being widely prescribed in combination with HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors {{for the treatment of}} HIV infection. The current studies evaluated the presence of metabolites circulating in plasma following the oral administration of nelfinavir to healthy volunteers and HIV-infected patients, as well as the levels in plasma and antiviral activities of these metabolites. The results showed that the parent drug was the major circulating chemical species, followed in decreasing abundance by its hydroxy-t-butylamide metabolite (M 8) and 3 ′-methoxy- 4 ′-hydroxynelfinavir (M 1). Antiviral assays with HIV- 1 strain RF-infected CEM-SS cells showed that the 50 % effective concentrations (EC 50) of nelfinavir, M 8, and M 1 were 30, 34, and 151 nM, respectively, and that the corresponding EC 50 against another HIV- 1 strain, IIIB, in MT- 2 cells were 60, 86, and 653 nM. Therefore, apparently similar in vitro antiviral activities were demonstrated for nelfinavir and M 8, whereas an approximately 5 - to 11 -fold-lower level of antiviral activity was observed for M 1. The active metabolite, M 8, showed a degree of binding to human plasma proteins similar to that of nelfinavir (ca. 98 %). Concentrations in plasma of nelfinavir and its metabolites in 10 HIV-positive patients receiving nelfinavir therapy (750 mg three times per day) were determined by a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay. At steady state (day 28), the mean plasma nelfinavir concentrations ranged from 1. 73 to 4. 96 μM and the M 8 concentrations ranged from 0. 55 to 1. 96 μM, whereas the M 1 concentrations were low and ranged from 0. 09 to 0. 19 μM. In conclusion, the findings from the current studies suggest that, in humans, nelfinavir forms an active metabolite circulating at appreciable levels in plasma. The active metabolite M 8 may account for some of the antiviral activity associated with nelfinavir in the treatment of HIV disease...|$|E
30|$|Sulfur-containing {{aromatic}} compounds, notably aryl sulfides {{and their}} derivatives, are prominent in {{fields such as}} biological, pharmaceutical, and materials fields. In particular, their use in synthesizing biologically and pharmaceutically important organosulfur compounds such as HIV protease inhibitors [1] (<b>Viracept,</b> Nelfinavir Mesylate, AG 1343), LFA- 1 /ICAM- 1 antagonists [2], and arylthioindoles [3] (potent inhibitors of tubulin assembly) is still not fully understood by synthetic chemists. In general, molecules containing one or more carbon-sulfur bonds {{can be used as}} molecular precursors for the synthesis of new materials [4]. However, compared to C-N and C-O bonds, the transition metal-catalyzed C(aryl)-S bond formation has not been well studied. This bond formation is thought to be partial because of the formation of an S-S coupled product and a concurrent deactivation of the metal catalyst due to the strong coordinative and adsorptive properties of sulfur, which can decrease catalytic activity [5]. General methods for C-S cross-coupling involve the condensation of aryl halides with thiols and, usually, require temperatures greater than 200 °C. These methods also require strongly basic, toxic, high-boiling, polar solvents, namely HMPA, quinolone, or N,N-dimethylacetamide. In order to circumvent these complications, a meticulous effort has been focused on the development of transition metal-catalyzed coupling of thiophenols with aryl halides. Previously, iron [6], nickel [7, 8], palladium [9, 10], cobalt [11], and copper-based [12 – 16] catalytic systems have been reported for this purpose. Even though significant improvements have been made, appropriate techniques are still needed for the synthesis of diaryl thioethers. To date, metal and metal oxide nanoparticles have often been used as metal catalysts because of their physical and chemical stability. In addition, the advantage of nanoparticles including large surface area and heterogeneous nature make them applicable to a broad range of scientific fields and functions such as the immobilization of biomolecules [17], catalysis of organic [18 – 23] and electrochemical reactions [17], use in electrochemical sensors and biosensors [17], enhancement of electron transfer [17], labeling of biomolecules [17], and synthesis of nanofluids [24], antibacterial materials [25], photocatalysts [25, 26], solar cells [27], and so on. Among the various available metal oxide nanoparticles, two copper oxides (Cu 2 O, CuO) have been studied for use in p-type semiconductor materials with narrow band gaps. This is because copper oxides are less expensive, recyclable, and non-toxic and have suitable optical and electronic properties [28 – 32]. Thus, as part of the effort to find new catalytic systems and better understand the role of transition metal nanoparticles in organic transformations, we report herein the use of CuO hollow nanoparticles as catalysts for efficient syntheses of diaryl thioethers. These CuO hollow nanoparticles have advantages in terms of large-scale synthesis and uniform shape compared to previous reported CuO nanoparticles [33, 34]. In recent times, microwave-irradiated organic reactions have become increasingly popular as valuable alternatives to the use of conductive heating for promoting chemical reactions. Besides, improved yields within short reaction time were observed. Microwave activation, as a non-conventional energy source, is becoming a very popular and valuable technique in organic synthesis, as evidenced by the increasing number of annual publications on this topic. In continuation of our previous reports [35], we discovered that microwave irradiation can even accelerate the Ullmann coupling of activated aryl iodides and thiophenols.|$|E
