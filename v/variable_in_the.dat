5|$|Although fainter {{than its}} {{northern}} counterpart, the oval- or horseshoe-shaped pattern of its brighter stars renders it distinctive. Alpha and Beta Coronae Australis {{are the two}} brightest stars with an apparent magnitude of around 4.1. Epsilon Coronae Australis is the brightest example of a W Ursae Majoris <b>variable</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern sky. Lying alongside the Milky Way, Corona Australis contains one of the closest star-forming regions to the Solar System—a dusty dark nebula known as the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, lying about 430 light years away. Within it are stars at the earliest stages of their lifespan. The variable stars R and TY Coronae Australis light up parts of the nebula, which varies in brightness accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Capella {{has long}} been {{suspected}} to be slightly variable. Its amplitude of about 0.1 magnitudes means that it may at times be brighter or fainter than both Rigel and Vega, which are also slightly variable. The system has been classified as an RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a class of binary stars with active chromospheres that cause huge starspots, {{but it is still}} only listed as a suspected <b>variable</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> General Catalogue of Variable Stars. Unusually for RS CVn systems, the hotter star, Capella Ab, has the more active atmosphere because it is located in the Hertzsprung gap—a stage where it is changing its angular momentum and deepening its convection zone.|$|E

5|$|No {{consensus}} existed {{regarding the}} taxonomy of Psittaciformes until recently. The {{placement of the}} Strigopoidea species has been <b>variable</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. They were once {{considered part of the}} Psittacoidea, but recent 21st-century studies place this group of New Zealand species as their own superfamily next to the Cacatuoidea and remaining members of the Psittacoidea. Many studies have confirmed the unique placement of this group {{at the base of the}} parrot tree. Most authors now recognize this group as a separate taxon containing two families: Nestoridae and Strigopidae. Conversely, the relationships among various cockatoo genera are largely resolved.|$|E
5|$|A {{stochastic}} or {{random process}} {{can be defined as}} a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each random <b>variable</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time. A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E
5|$|Behavior {{is known}} {{mainly from the}} marsh rice rat and O.couesi, with some {{scattered}} data from the other species. Oryzomys are semiaquatic, spending {{much time in the}} water, and otherwise mainly live on the ground; both the marsh rice rat and O.couesi are known to be excellent swimmers and will flee into the water when disturbed. Both are also active during the night and build nests of interwoven vegetation, which may be suspended above the water. Breeding may occur throughout the year in both species, but is known to be seasonally <b>variable</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> marsh rice rat. In both, gestation takes about 21 to 28days and litter size is usually one to seven, averaging three to five. Young marsh rice rats and O.couesi become reproductively active when about 50days old.|$|E

5|$|The King Island emu and the {{mainland}} emu show few morphological differences {{other than their}} significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of {{the mainland}} emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the culmen, whereas it was four times longer in the mainland emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the cranium. However, the distal foramen is known to be <b>variable</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The same is true of the contour of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus.|$|E
5|$|The {{requirements}} for the priesthood differed over time and among the cults of different gods. Although detailed theological knowledge was involved in priestly offices, {{little is known about}} what knowledge or training may have been required of the officeholders. Priests were required to observe strict standards of ritual purity in the sacred space. They shaved their heads and bodies, washed several times a day, and wore only clean linen clothing. They were not required to be celibate, but sexual intercourse rendered them unclean until they underwent further purification. The cults of specific gods might impose further restrictions related to that god's mythology, such as rules against eating the meat of an animal that represented the god. The acceptance of women into the priesthood was <b>variable.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Old Kingdom many women served as priests, but their presence in clergies declined drastically in the Middle Kingdom before increasing in the Third Intermediate Period. Lesser positions, such as that of musician in ceremonies, remained open to women in even the most restrictive periods, as did the special role of ceremonial consort of the god. This latter role was highly influential, and {{the most important of these}} consorts, the God's Wife of Amun, even supplanted the High Priest of Amun during the Late Period.|$|E

These distinctions translate to differences in the elasticity (responsiveness) of the supply curve in the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price-quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand side of the market.|$|E

25|$|The blade {{geometry}} {{was highly}} <b>variable</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tests, {{so it is}} likely that the negative dependence of the dimensionless force on Reynolds number is the major factor. This whistle has two features that separate it from the other whistles described here. The first is that there are a multiplicity of these dipole sources arrayed around the periphery, that most likely are radiating at the same frequency, but incoherently. The second is that blade motion creates a steady, but rotating, pressure field at each blade. The rotating steady force creates a rotating dipole field which has an influence in the geometric near field. The feedback is Class I (hydrodynamic) and there is no indication that stages other than Stage 1 occur.|$|E
