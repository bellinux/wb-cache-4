40|$|Recent {{research}} on hydraulic systems has mainly focused on energy saving. This {{is because the}} efficiency of hydraulic systems is very low {{even though they have}} large power-to-size ratios. In mobile hydraulic equipment, conventional hydraulic spool valves with pressure compensators have already been replaced by <b>valve</b> <b>assemblies</b> with four-valve independent metering with electronically controlled pressure compensation. The independent metering concept and microprocessor control have much more potential to save more energy than conventional proportional valve control because of the increased controllability of the system.

This new model offers two degrees of freedom, i. e., controlling velocity and pressure, just as in conventional IMVs. In the system described here, two of the three independent valves are active during metering. In this paper, the theory behind a new method of flow control based upon load feedback is presented for two of the five distinct metering modes, and its performance is investigated and compared to that of a conventional IMV configuration...|$|E
40|$|Gas-lifted {{oil wells}} are {{susceptible}} to failure through malfunction of gas lift <b>valve</b> <b>assemblies</b> (GLV). One failure mode occurs when the GLV check valve fails and product passes into the well annulus, potentially reaching the wellhead. This {{is a growing concern}} as offshore wells are drilled thousands of meters below the ocean floor in extreme temperature and pressure conditions, and repair and monitoring become difficult. Currently no safeguard exists in the GLV to prevent product passage in the event of check valve failure. In this paper a design and operational procedures are proposed for a thermally-actuated positive-locking safety valve to seal the GLV in the event of check valve failure. A thermal model of the well and GLV system is developed and compared to well data to verify feasibility of a thermally-actuated safety valve. A 3 × scale prototype safety valve is built and tested under simulated failure scenarios and well start-up scenarios. Realistic well temperatures in the range of 20 C to 70 C are used.

Steel samples including sections of the box car panels and a bolt from an air brake assembly were analyzed using standard metallurgical methods to determine oxide layer thickness {{and the amount of}} metal lost {{as a result of the}} elevated temperature exposure. Aluminum alloy air brake <b>valve</b> <b>assemblies,</b> which melted as a consequence of the fire, were analyzed using a heat transfer model.

Independent assessment of fire duration could not be obtained from the steel components because the oxide scale thickness and metal loss are dependent on both time and temperature. Several limitations to the assessment of temperature were noted including the effects of oxide-scale spalling and post-fire atmospheric exposure for a period of more than 1 year.

Collagen, elastin, glycosaminoglycan, lipid and water contents were {{expressed in terms of}} relative concentration and volume fraction in order to assess their effective contribution to the native tissue and to changes following decellularization procedures. The main findings were recognition of unexpectedly large water and underestimated collagen contents, differential distribution of elastin between the sectors and of glycosaminoglycan along the conduits and pulmonary scaffold destabilization upon cell removal, not found in the aortic case. Simultaneous investigations allowed consistent comparisons between native and decellularized tissues and added analytical knowledge crucial for designing realistic constitutive models. We have provided a quantitative structural foundation for earlier biomechanical findings in pulmonary leaflets and the basis for validation of theoretical assumptions still lacking the support of experimental evidence in both conduits. Future insights into the distribution of load-bearing components in human conduits are likely to provide indications important to optimize the surgical positioning of valvular grafts...|$|E

Each vent valve assembly includes a cantilever spring that is flat in an unstressed condition and that has a free end portion.

40|$|As {{environmental}} awareness increases, cleaner burning fuels are desired {{for use in}} power plants. Fuels such hydrogen, methane and syngas are cleaner and leaner burning, which causes combustion instabilities. The Active Combustion Throttle (ACT) project {{is sponsored by the}} Department of Energy's National Energy Technologies Laboratory (NETL) and aspires to create a valve capable of modulating the flow of fuel administered to gas turbines by +/- 10 %. Development of such a valve will require an integrated valve and actuator design that can withstand the harsh environment of a power plant as well have a closed loop feedback control system in order to avoid combustion instabilities. In this thesis, an in-depth survey of current actuator and valve technologies revealed there are not any commercially available integrated <b>valve</b> <b>assemblies</b> capable of performing such a task. Two valve designs and one actuator design were devised to meet a list of specifications from NETL. Both valve designs as well as the actuator design underwent a rigorous battery of electromagnetic, stress, thermal, finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analyses using contemporary mechanical, electrical and physical theory and commercially available computer-aided design (CAD) programs. Prototype valve designs were designed, machined, cold flow tested and approved for further prototype design and testing. Initial cold flow testing revealed that both valve designs had linear ranges, were quick opening and demonstrated adequate flow coefficients (Cv). Further testing will continue to refine the valve designs in preparation for creating integrated valve/actuator assemblies for more aggressive testing. The primary contribution of this thesis are the two valve designs and actuator design that have thus far proven to be capable of fulfilling the requirements set forth by NETL for the ACT project. Further research and analyses of these designs will provide more robust prototype valve and actuator assemblies for eventual live testing at NETL. The framework provided by this thesis will allow those involved with the project to make changes to the current designs as needed since the same analyses can be more efficiently executed for subsequent changes throughout the remaining stages of development...|$|E
40|$|There were 5 {{control valves}} and 2 manual valves for the liquid {{nitrogen}} distribution system {{that needed to}} be sized and procured for the upgrade. This engineering note documents the calculations done to properly size these valves. A table summarizes the valve choices. The raw calculations are attached as an appendix. The calculations jump around a bit. No effort was made to re-organize or rewrite them for the reader. The sizing calcs. on Pages 1 through 4 were first pass calcs. based on pure liquid to the valves with no attention to flashing/choking. The calcs on pages 5 through 8 then refine the calculations by considering the LN 2 to the valve inlets to be two phase with quality of 0. 032. This is a real situation if the LN 2 subcooler is out of service for use as a He cooldown heat exchanger. Also, flashing would occur for this situation and is taken into account. The end result of this refinement pushed the Cv values up by about a factor of 3 over the initial calcs. of pages 1 through 4. The results of the refined (correct) calculations pages 5 through 8 appear in the table above. The required operating Cv's are smaller than commercially available LN 2 control valves. Therefore it has been decided to use Fermilab Saver type control <b>valve</b> <b>assemblies</b> with the valve bullet Cv 1 s listed above. The bullets are 100 : 1 equal percentage types and provide better control at the lower percentage of valve Cv values. See flow characteristic data and curve for these valves in appendix B. The manual valves will be commercially purchased, probably a Cryolab model CV 3 - 84 - 5 WPG 2 or CV 8 - 84 - 5 WPG 2 or CVI model V- 1060 - 050 -VJ. Pages 8 - 10 calculate a minimum required cooldown flowrate as referenced in Cryogenic Systems by Barron. This was done to be sure the valves and piping system did not choke the warm flow so much that cooldown could not be achieved. The minimum mass flow rate needed for a simultaneous, serial cooldown of the refrigerator, solenoid and VLPC system was 6. 4 g/s. This warm flow would get choked by an opening less than 0. 175 -inch in diameter. A valve with only 10 psi differential across it with this flowrate would need to be Cv= 0. 85. These numbers show that cooldown will be achievable. Firstly, the flow through these components is not serial. The flows get split and sent to vent separately. Secondly, the valves are located upstream of the heat load. And lastly, the Cv of the valves are larger than 0. 85 except for the solenoid which has a very low heat load/small flow split and the VLPC's. The VLPC flow split brings the minimal required Cv for a valve situated at the warm outlet of the LN 2 circuit to be 0. 26. I foresee no, problems cooling down the LN 2 components...|$|E
