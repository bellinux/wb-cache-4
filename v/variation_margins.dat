This new regulation, states that largely standardized OTC derivative contracts should be traded on electronic exchanges, and cleared centrally by Central Counterparty/Clearing House trades.

40|$|International audienceUsing daily data on {{margins and}} <b>variation</b> <b>margins</b> for all {{clearing}} {{members of the}} Chicago Mercantile Exchange, we analyze the clearing house exposure {{to the risk of}} default by clearing members. We find that the major source of default risk for a clearing member is proprietary trading rather than trading by customers. Additionally, we show that extreme losses suffered by important clearing firms tend to cluster, which raises systemic risk concerns. Finally, we discuss how private insurance could be used to cover the loss from defaults by clearing members...|$|E
40|$|We analyze optimal hedging {{contracts}} between a protection buyer and protection sellers. When a seller observes that the hedge {{is likely to}} become a liability for her, it reduces her incentives to exert unobservable risk-prevention effort.

30|$|Moreover, {{the bank}} can use reserve capital as <b>variation</b> <b>margin.</b> Note that the {{marginal}} {{cost of capital}} for using capital as a funding source for <b>variation</b> <b>margin</b> is nil, because when one posts cash against <b>variation</b> <b>margin,</b> the valuation of the collateralized hedge is reset to zero and the total capital amount does not change. If, instead, the bank were to post capital as initial margin, then the bank would record a “margin receivable” entry on its balance sheet, which however cannot contribute to capital since this asset is too illiquid and impossible to unwind without unwinding all underlying derivatives. Hence, capital can only be used as VM, while it seems that IM must be borrowed entirely.|$|R

30|$|In the post-crisis world, CCPs {{have assumed}} a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} financial system. They exist as the agent between two counterparties on opposite sides of a trade, with the purpose of eliminating counterparty risk. The questions their role poses are whether they are themselves a safe counterparty, and whether their size constitutes a significant systemic risk. CCPs’ business is complex to model. Each CCP may have thousands of clients, also called general clearing members (GCMs), and each GCM may deal with multiple CCPs. There are initial margins, <b>variation</b> <b>margins</b> and default fund contributions to be considered. The correlation structure is such that an analytical description of this system is impossible. Studies on CCPs’ efficiency have returned mixed results.|$|E
40|$|We analyze optimal hedging {{contracts}} {{and show that}} although hedging aims at sharing risk, {{it can lead to}} more risk-taking. News implying that a hedge is likely to be loss-making undermines the risk-prevention incentives of the protection seller. This incentive problem limits the capacity to share risks and generates endogenous counterparty risk. Optimal hedging can therefore lead to contagion from news about insured risks to the balance sheet of insurers. Such endogenous risk is more likely to materialize ex post when the ex ante probability of counterparty default is low. <b>Variation</b> <b>margins</b> emerge as an optimal mechanism to enhance risk-sharing capacity. Paradoxically, they can also induce more risk-taking. Initial margins address the market failure caused by unregulated trading of {{hedging contracts}} among protection sellers.

30|$|In {{the present}} paper we apply this {{framework}} to the concrete setup of a bank engaged in bilateral trade portfolios. In this context, the discounted expectation of losses due to the default of counterparties or of the bank itself are respectively known as CVA (credit valuation adjustment) and DVA (debt valuation adjustment). Counterparty risk mitigants include the <b>variation</b> <b>margin</b> (VM), tracking the mark-to-market of client portfolios, and the initial margin (IM) set as a cushion against gap risk, which is the risk of slippage between the portfolio and its <b>variation</b> <b>margin</b> during liquidation periods. The cost of funding cash collateral for the <b>variation</b> <b>margin</b> is known as funding valuation adjustment (FVA), while the cost of funding segregated collateral posted as initial margin is the margin valuation adjustment (MVA). Contra-liability counterparts of the FVA and the MVA arise as the FDA (funding debt adjustment) and the MDA (margin debt adjustment). The contra-liability component of a unilateral CVA is dubbed CVACL.|$|R

The English law Credit Support Annexes are Confirmations, and the transactions constituted by them are Transactions, under the Master Agreement and therefore form part of the single agreement together with the Master Agreement. The English law Credit Support Deed, on the other hand, is a separate agreement between the parties.|$|R
40|$|The G 20 OTC (over-the-counter) {{derivatives}} reforms impose large collateral/liquidity {{demands on}} clearing members of Central Counterparty (CCP) clearing platforms {{in the form}} of initial margins, <b>variation</b> <b>margins</b> and contributions to the default fund. In Heath et al. (2016), it was shown how this introduces a trade-off between liquidity risk and solvency risk with the system manifesting considerable systemic risk from these two sources of risk while CCP penetration is at current levels. The authors extend this analysis to include the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) skin-in-the-game requirements for CCPs, which aim to ameliorate the contributions to the default fund by clearing members and also to prevent moral hazard problems associated with the too-interconnected-to-fail (TITF) status of CCPs as more and more derivatives are centrally cleared.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{dialogue}} on Funding Costs and Counterparty Credit Risk modeling, inclusive of collateral, wrong way risk, gap risk and possible Central Clearing implementation through CCPs. This framework is important following {{the fact that}} derivatives valuation and risk analysis has moved from exotic derivatives managed on simple single asset classes to simple derivatives embedding the new or previously neglected types of complex and interconnected nonlinear risks we address here. This dialogue is {{the continuation of the}} "Counterparty Risk, Collateral and Funding FAQ" by Brigo (2011). In this dialogue we focus more on funding costs for the hedging strategy of a portfolio of trades, on the non-linearities emerging from assuming borrowing and lending rates to be different, on the resulting aggregation-dependent valuation process and its operational challenges, on the implications of the onset of central clearing, on the macro and micro effects on valuation and risk of the onset of CCPs, on initial and <b>variation</b> <b>margins</b> impact on valuation, and on multiple discount curves. Through questions and answers (Q&A) between a senior expert and a junior colleague, and by referring to the growing body of literature on the subject, we present a unified view of valuation (and risk) that takes all such aspects into account...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of CCPs in most derivative transactions will dramatically change {{the landscape of}} derivatives pricing, hedging and risk management, and, according to the TABB group, will lead to an overall liquidity impact about 2 USD trillions. In this article we develop {{for the first time}} a comprehensive approach for pricing under CCP clearing, including variation and initial margins, gap credit risk and collateralization, showing concrete examples for interest rate swaps. Mathematically, the inclusion of asymmetric borrowing and lending rates in the hedge of a claim lead to nonlinearities showing up in claim dependent pricing measures, aggregation dependent prices, nonlinear PDEs and BSDEs. This still holds in presence of CCPs and CSA. We introduce a modeling approach that allows us to enforce rigorous separation of the interconnected nonlinear risks into different valuation adjustments where the key pricing nonlinearities are confined to a funding costs component that is analyzed through numerical schemes for BSDEs. We present a numerical case study for Interest Rate Swaps that highlights the relative size of the different valuation adjustments and the quantitative role of initial and <b>variation</b> <b>margins,</b> of liquidity bases, of credit risk, of the margin period of risk and of wrong way risk correlations...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims to {{identify}} the parameters that influence the cost competitiveness of helicopter services for scheduled passenger transport on a regional area. Design/methodology/approach - The approach used {{is based on an}} analysis of demand and on a bi-level model (modal split model - service supply optimization model) optimization. Performance optimization in the supply of helicopter transport services is obtained by a sensitivity analysis on the recognized cost factors. Findings - The identification of the <b>variation</b> <b>margins</b> in the cost factors that might make an helicopter competitive for scheduled passenger services. Research limitations/implications - The inability to consider the totality of the helicopters today on the market due to lack of available data on their cost structure. Practical implications - It is represented by the opportunity of the spread of the helicopter through the strengthening of the competitive position in relation to other transport modes for passenger transport services. Social implications - It is represented by the ability to provide air transport services less expensive on the routes that connect the mainland with small islands, especially during the months when the sea conditions do not allow the naval connection causing the insulation phenomenon.

40|$|We {{develop an}} arbitrage-free {{framework}} for consistent valuation of derivative trades with collateralization, counterparty credit gap risk, and funding costs, following the approach first proposed by Pallavicini and co-authors in 2011. Based on the risk-neutral pricing principle, we derive a general pricing equation where Credit, Debit, Liquidity and Funding Valuation Adjustments (CVA, DVA, LVA and FVA) are introduced by simply modifying the payout cash-flows of the deal. Funding costs and specific close-out procedures at default break the bilateral {{nature of the}} deal price and render the valuation problem a non-linear and recursive one. CVA and FVA are in general not really additive adjustments, and the risk for double counting is concrete. We introduce a new adjustment, called a Non-linearity Valuation Adjustment (NVA), to address double-counting. The theoretical risk free rate disappears from our final equations. The framework can be tailored also to CCP trading under initial and <b>variation</b> <b>margins,</b> as explained in detail in Brigo and Pallavicini (2014). In particular, we allow for asymmetric collateral and funding rates, replacement close-out and re-hypothecation. The valuation equation {{takes the form of}} a backward stochastic differential equation or semi-linear partial differential equation, and can be cast as a set of iterative equations that can be solved by least-squares Monte Carlo. We propose such a simulation algorithm in a case study involving a generalization of the benchmark model of Black and Scholes for option pricing. Our numerical results confirm that funding risk has a non-trivial impact on the deal price, and that double counting matters too. We conclude the article with an analysis of large scale implications of non-linearity of the pricing equations. Comment: An updated version of this report will appear in the volume: Veronesi, P.

40|$|The {{rapidly growing}} hedge fund {{industry}} has brought substantial benefits to financial markets. At the same time, hedge funds can {{in some circumstances}} {{give rise to a}} number of potential risks. Not unlike in the period following the Asian crisis and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, governments, regulators, and central banks have been called upon to assess whether additional regulatory initiatives are required to mitigate these risks. There are three potential regulatory objectives that can be invoked. They are investor protection, market integrity protection and financial system protection. The link between hedge funds and the stability of the financial system relates to the possibility that large losses in one or several hedge funds get transmitted to one or several large internationally active banks.

40|$|MCom. (Risk management), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The South African white maize {{market is}} {{considered}} to be significantly more volatile than any other agricultural product traded on the South African Futures Exchange (SAFEX). This accentuates the need to effectively manage price risk, by means of hedging, to ensure a more profitable and sustainable maize production sector (Geyser, 2013 : 39; Jordaan, Grové, Jooste, A. & Jooste, Z. G., 2007 : 320). However, hedging at lower price levels might result in significant <b>variation</b> <b>margins</b> or costly buy–outs in order to fulfil the contract obligations. This challenge is addressed in this study by making use of technical analysis, focusing on the development of a practical and applicable composite technical indicator with the purpose of improving the timing of price risk management decisions identified by individual technical indicators. This may ultimately assist a producer in achieving a higher average hedge level compared to popular individual technical indicators. The process of constructing a composite indicator was commenced by examining the prevailing tendency of the market. By making use of the Directional Movement Index (DMI), as identified in the literature study, the market was found to continually shift between trending prices (prices moving either upwards or downwards) and prices trading sideways. Consequently, implementing only a leading (statistically more suitable for trading markets) or lagging (statistically more suitable for trending markets) technical indicator may generate false sell signals, as demonstrated by the application of these technical indicators in the white maize market. This substantiated the motivation for compiling a composite indicator that takes both leading and lagging indicators into account to more accurately identify hedging opportunities. The composite indicator made use of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic oscillator as leading indicators, and the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) as lagging indicators. The results validated the applicability of such a composite indicator, as the composite indicator outperformed the individual technical indicators in the white maize market. The composite indicator achieved the highest average hedge level, the lowest average sell signals generated over the entire period, as well as the highest average hedge level {{as a percentage of the}} maximum price over the entire period. Hence, the composite indicator recognised hedging opportunities more accurately compared to individual technical indicators, which ultimately led to higher achieved hedging levels. Master...|$|E

3000|$|We {{apply to}} the {{concrete}} setup of a bank engaged into bilateral trade portfolios the XVA theoretical framework of [...] (Albanese and Crépey 2017), whereby so-called contra-liabilities and cost of capital are charged by the bank to its clients, {{on top of the}} fair valuation of counterparty risk, in order to account for the incompleteness of this risk. The transfer of the residual reserve credit capital from shareholders to creditors at bank default results in a unilateral CVA, consistent with the regulatory requirement that capital should not diminish as an effect of the sole deterioration of the bank credit spread. Our funding cost for <b>variation</b> <b>margin</b> (FVA) is defined asymmetrically since there is no benefit in holding excess capital in the future. Capital is fungible as a source of funding for <b>variation</b> <b>margin,</b> causing a material FVA reduction.
