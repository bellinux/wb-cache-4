5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antidepressants, and the available evidence indicates that it is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft) and <b>venlafaxine</b> (Effexor) over bupropion have been observed. Mirtazapine (Remeron), on the other hand is significantly more effective than bupropion. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction. Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|<b>Venlafaxine</b> is {{contraindicated}} in children, {{adolescents and}} young adults. According to the FDA analysis of clinical trials <b>venlafaxine</b> caused a statistically significant 5-fold increase in suicidal ideation and behaviour in persons younger than 25. In another analysis, <b>venlafaxine</b> was no better than placebo among children (7–11 years old), but improved depression in adolescents (12–17 years old). However, in both groups, hostility and suicidal behaviour increased in comparison to those receiving a placebo. In a study involving antidepressants that had failed to produce results in depressed teenagers, teens whose SSRI treatment had failed who were randomly switched to either another SSRI or to <b>venlafaxine</b> showed an increased rate of suicide on <b>venlafaxine.</b> Among teenagers who were suicidal {{at the beginning of}} the study, the rate of suicidal attempts and self-harm was significantly higher, by about 60%, after the switch to <b>venlafaxine</b> than after the switch to an SSRI.|$|E
25|$|<b>Venlafaxine</b> {{extended}} {{release is}} chemically {{the same as}} normal <b>venlafaxine.</b> The extended release (controlled release) version distributes {{the release of the}} drug into the gastrointestinal tract over a longer period than normal <b>venlafaxine.</b> This results in a lower peak plasma concentration. Studies have shown that the extended release formula has a lower incidence of nausea as a side effect, resulting in better compliance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Venlafaxine</b> was {{originally}} marketed as Effexor {{in most of}} the world; generic <b>venlafaxine</b> has been available since around 2008 and extended release venlaxafine has been available since around 2010.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 meta {{analysis}} of 21 clinical trials of <b>venlafaxine</b> {{for the treatment}} of depression in adults found that compared to placebo, <b>venlafaxine</b> reduced the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.|$|E
25|$|<b>Venlafaxine</b> {{should be}} taken with caution when using St John's wort. <b>Venlafaxine</b> may lower the seizure {{threshold}}, and coadministration with other drugs that lower the seizure threshold such as bupropion and tramadol {{should be done with}} caution and at low doses.|$|E
25|$|Active {{metabolite}} of <b>venlafaxine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Venlafaxine</b> is well absorbed, with {{at least}} 92% of an oral dose being absorbed into {{systemic}} circulation. It is extensively metabolized in the liver via the CYP2D6 isoenzyme to desvenlafaxine (O-desmethylvenlafaxine), which is just as potent a SNRI as the parent compound, meaning that the differences in metabolism between extensive and poor metabolisers are not clinically {{important in terms of}} efficacy. Side effects, however, are reported to be more severe in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. Steady-state concentrations of <b>venlafaxine</b> and its metabolite are attained in the blood within 3 days. Therapeutic effects are usually achieved within 3 to 4 weeks. No accumulation of <b>venlafaxine</b> has been observed during chronic administration in healthy subjects. The primary route of excretion of <b>venlafaxine</b> and its metabolites is via the kidneys. The half-life of <b>venlafaxine</b> is relatively short, so patients are directed to adhere to a strict medication routine, avoiding missing a dose. Even a single missed dose can result in withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|People {{stopping}} <b>venlafaxine</b> commonly experience discontinuation {{symptoms such as}} dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, {{sensation of}} electric shocks, and sleep disturbance. <b>Venlafaxine</b> has {{a higher rate of}} moderate to severe discontinuation symptoms relative to other antidepressants (similar to the SSRI paroxetine).|$|E
25|$|<b>Venlafaxine</b> {{is neither}} {{recommended}} nor approved {{for the treatment}} of major depressive episodes in bipolar disorder as it can induce mania or mixed episodes. <b>Venlafaxine</b> appears to be more likely than the SSRIs and bupropion to induce mania and mixed episodes in bipolar patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{higher risk}} and {{increased}} severity of discontinuation syndrome symptoms {{relative to other}} antidepressants {{may be related to}} the short half-life of <b>venlafaxine</b> and its active metabolite. After discontinuing <b>venlafaxine,</b> the levels of both serotonin and norepinephrine decrease, leading to the hypothesis that the discontinuation symptoms could result from an overly rapid deprivation of neurotransmitter levels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Venlafaxine</b> can {{increase}} eye pressure, so those with glaucoma may require more frequent eye checks.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} structure of <b>venlafaxine</b> is designated (R/S)-1- cyclohexanol hydrochloride or (±)-1- cyclohexanol hydrochloride, {{and it has}} the empirical formula of C17H27NO2. It is a white to off-white crystalline solid. <b>Venlafaxine</b> is structurally and pharmacologically related to the atypical opioid analgesic tramadol, and more distantly to the newly released opioid tapentadol, but not to any of the conventional antidepressant drugs, including tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, MAOIs, or RIMAs.|$|E
25|$|Studies of <b>venlafaxine</b> in {{children}} have not established its efficacy. <b>Venlafaxine</b> {{is not recommended}} in patients hypersensitive to it, nor should it be taken by anyone who is allergic to the inactive ingredients, which include gelatin, cellulose, ethylcellulose, iron oxide, titanium dioxide and hypromellose. It {{should not be used}} in conjunction with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), as it can cause potentially fatal serotonin syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{action on}} both the serotoninergic and {{adrenergic}} systems, <b>venlafaxine</b> is also used as a treatment to reduce episodes of cataplexy, a form of muscle weakness, in patients with the sleep disorder narcolepsy. Some open-label and three double-blind studies have suggested the efficacy of <b>venlafaxine</b> {{in the treatment of}} attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Clinical trials have found possible efficacy in those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).|$|E
25|$|A {{comparative}} {{meta-analysis of}} 12 major antidepressants found that <b>venlafaxine,</b> mirtazapine, escitalopram, and sertraline {{were significantly more}} efficacious than duloxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine. A combination of <b>venlafaxine</b> and mirtazapine achieved remission rates (defined as a HAM-D score of 7 or less) of 58% in one controlled trial. In combination with an antipsychotic medicine aripiprazole, better results in treatment resistant depression in older adults have been demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, <b>venlafaxine</b> was {{the sixth}} most {{commonly}} prescribed antidepressant on the U.S. retail market, with 17.2 million prescriptions.|$|E
25|$|In the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence {{ranking of}} 10 {{antidepressants}} for efficacy and cost-effectiveness citalopram is fifth in effectiveness (after mirtazapine, escitalopram, <b>venlafaxine,</b> and sertraline) and fourth in cost-effectiveness. The ranking results {{were based on}} the meta-analysis by Andrea Cipriani. In another analysis by Cipriani, citalopram was found to be more efficacious than paroxetine and reboxetine, and more acceptable than tricyclics, reboxetine, and <b>venlafaxine,</b> but less efficacious than escitalopram.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{specific}} antidote for <b>venlafaxine,</b> and management is generally supportive, providing {{treatment for the}} immediate symptoms. Administration of activated charcoal can prevent absorption of the drug. Monitoring of cardiac rhythm and vital signs is indicated. Seizures are managed with benzodiazepines or other anticonvulsants. Forced diuresis, hemodialysis, exchange transfusion, or hemoperfusion {{are unlikely to be}} of benefit in hastening the removal of <b>venlafaxine,</b> due to the drug's high volume of distribution.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} false {{positive}} phencyclidine (PCP) results caused by larger doses of <b>venlafaxine,</b> with certain on-site routine urine-based drug tests.|$|E
25|$|<b>Venlafaxine</b> {{indirectly}} affects opioid receptors (mu-, kappa1- kappa3- and delta-opioid receptor subtypes) {{as well as}} the alpha2-adrenergic receptor, and {{was shown}} to increase pain threshold in mice. When mice were tested with a hotplate analgesia meter (to measure pain), both <b>venlafaxine</b> and mirtazapine induced a dose-dependent, naloxone-reversible antinociceptive effect following intraperitoneal injection. These findings suggest venlafaxine's seemingly superior efficacy in severe depression as opioids become increasingly used as a measure of last resort for refractory cases.|$|E
25|$|Netherlands: In the Netherlands, paroxetine, {{marketed as}} Seroxat among generic preparations, {{is the most}} {{prescribed}} antidepressant, followed by amitriptyline, citalopram and <b>venlafaxine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some doctors may {{prescribe}} <b>venlafaxine</b> {{off label}} {{for the treatment}} of diabetic neuropathy (in a similar manner to duloxetine) and migraine prophylaxis (in some people, however, <b>venlafaxine</b> can exacerbate or cause migraines). Studies have shown venlafaxine's effectiveness for these conditions, although agents that are marketed for this purpose (like pregabalin or duloxetine) are likely preferred. It has also been found to reduce the severity of 'hot flashes' in menopausal women and men on hormonal therapy {{for the treatment of}} prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|The US Food and Drug Administration body (FDA) {{requires}} all antidepressants, including <b>venlafaxine,</b> {{to carry}} a black box warning with a generic warning about a possible suicide risk.|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} of clinical trials by the FDA statisticians showed {{the incidence of}} suicidal behaviour among the adults on <b>venlafaxine</b> to be {{not significantly different from}} fluoxetine or placebo.|$|E
25|$|Paroxetine {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Comparative efficacy of paroxetine is equivalent to that of clomipramine and <b>venlafaxine.</b> Paroxetine is also effective for children with obsessive-compulsive disorder.|$|E
25|$|A study {{conducted}} in Finland followed more than 15,000 patients for 3.4 years. <b>Venlafaxine</b> increased suicide risk by 60% (statistically significant), {{as compared to}} no treatment. At the same time, fluoxetine (Prozac) halved the suicide risk.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 {{meta-analysis}} {{found that}} fluoxetine and <b>venlafaxine</b> were effective for major depression in all age groups. The authors also {{found no evidence}} of a relationship between baseline severity of depression and degree of benefit of antidepressants over placebo.|$|E
25|$|<b>Venlafaxine</b> is a {{substrate}} of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which pumps {{it out of}} the brain. The gene encoding P-gp, ABCB1, has the SNP rs2032583, with alleles C and T. The {{majority of}} people (about 70% of Europeans and 90% of East Asians) have the TT variant. A 2007 study found that carriers of at least one C allele (variant CC or CT) are 7.72 times more likely than non-carriers to achieve remission after 4 weeks of treatment with amitriptyline, citalopram, paroxetine or <b>venlafaxine</b> (all P-gp substrates). The study included patients with mood disorders other than major depression, such as bipolar II; the ratio is 9.4 if these other disorders are excluded. At the 6-week mark, 75% of C-carriers had remitted, compared to only 38% of non-carriers.|$|E
25|$|Changes in {{appetite}} or weight {{are common}} among antidepressants, but largely drug-dependent and {{are related to}} which neurotransmitters they affect. Mirtazapine and paroxetine, for example, {{have the effect of}} weight gain and/or increased appetite, while others (such as bupropion and <b>venlafaxine)</b> achieve the opposite effect.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 review {{concluded}} that 51% {{of studies of}} various SSRIs yielded positive outcomes. Sertraline is statistically similar in efficacy to other SSRIs such asparoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram and <b>venlafaxine</b> (SNRI). Evidence suggests that sertraline {{may be more effective}} thanfluoxetine(Prozac) for some subtypes of depression.|$|E
25|$|There were no {{statistical}} or meaningful clinical differences in remission rates, response rates, or times to remission or response among {{any of the}} medications compared in this study. These included bupropion sustained release, bupropion, citalopram, lithium, mirtazapine, nortriptyline, sertraline, triiodothyronine, tranylcypromine, and <b>venlafaxine</b> extended release.|$|E
25|$|Methylene blue is a {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), and if infused intravenously at doses exceeding 5mg/kg, may precipitate serious serotonin toxicity, serotonin syndrome, if combined with any selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other serotonin reuptake inhibitor (e.g., duloxetine, sibutramine, <b>venlafaxine,</b> clomipramine, imipramine).|$|E
25|$|Dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine, <b>venlafaxine,</b> and milnacipran, {{as well as}} {{tricyclic}} antidepressants such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine {{are considered}} first-line medications for this condition. While amitriptyline and desipramine {{have been used as}} first-line treatments, the quality of evidence to support their use is poor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Venlafaxine</b> is used {{primarily}} {{for the treatment of}} depression, general anxiety disorder, social phobia, panic disorder, and vasomotor symptoms. At low doses (<150nbsp&mg/day), it acts only on serotonergic transmission. At moderate doses (>150nbsp&mg/day), it acts on serotonergic and noradrenergic systems, whereas at high doses (>300nbsp&mg/day), it also affects dopaminergic neurotransmission.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} on SSRIs and SNRIs {{that look}} at partial response (defined {{as at least}} a 50% reduction in depression score from baseline) found that sertraline, paroxetine and duloxetine were better than placebo. With respect to safety duloxetine and <b>venlafaxine</b> increased worsened dizziness, however not much safety data was reported.|$|E
