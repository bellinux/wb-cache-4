40|$|The {{field of}} customs is {{commonly}} referred to as that of imports and exports. It is perceived as a maze of processes, procedures, and forms required to enable a customs administration to perform their wide range of responsibilities. One of the responsibilities of a customs administration is the collection of duties, which necessitates classification of the goods in question. This study sets out {{to determine the extent of}} customs control in relation to tariff classification in South Africa. The starting point is the establishment of the foundations of customs, both internationally and in South Africa. After origin and <b>valuation,</b> <b>tariff</b> classification is the third technical customs-related focus area. An analysis of the responsibilities of the customs administration in South Africa confirms the importance of revenue collection and, subsequently, tariff classification. As a result of South Africa’s membership of the World Customs Organization, specific obligations in relation to tariff classification are incurred. The implementation and application of the international provisions are considered and compared in South Africa, Australia, and Canada. Not only is South Africa’s existing legislation considered, but also two new Acts. It is found that despite similarities in the implementation of the Harmonized System Convention into the legislation of the three countries, South Africa’s existing legislation makes the most detailed provision for the Harmonized System and its aids. This is based on the finding that the legislation in Australia and Canada, as well as the two new Acts in South Africa, do not have the same comprehensive provisions. A critical review of the varying processes of classification in the three countries suggests that more suitable and effective processes could be implemented in South Africa. In addition, a synopsis of some of the principles developed in case law is provided and compared. In relation to facilitation, the access to relevant information and the adequacy thereof, as well as the availability of rulings, are considered. Differences in the approach to dispute resolution in the three countries are furthermore provided. Proposals are made to address the discrepancies in the implementation and application of the legislation, the process of classification, the principles developed in case law, the enhancement of related guides, the publication of tariff classification rulings, and the extent of facilitation and dispute resolution. Finally it is recommended that an independent and expert tribunal is established to adjudicate technical customs matters. Thesis (LLD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{a discrete}} choice model for combination of mobile tariffs and handsets using a crosssection of 11, 000 new customers from a European telecommunications carrier. It mainly {{focuses on the}} <b>valuation</b> of <b>tariff</b> price, handset subsidy and price of the handset. On the one hand, a significant evolution is observed over time. Indeed, important changes {{on the supply side}} are observed, mainly in the mobile service market but also in the retailing market. On the other hand, age of consumers also influences in a wide extent consumers valuation of services and handset. Accounting for this heterogeneity, the model enables to estimate a measure for myopia occurring when consumers are trading-off price of the tariff and upfront cost of the handset. If evidence of myopia is shown for the whole time period considered (Q 4 of 2011 - Q 4 of 2014), its magnitude tends to decrease significantly since the end of 2012. This effect is mainly due to the take-off of sim-only contracts, emergence of cheaper handsets and improved quality of information provided to consumers...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To value EQ- 5 D health {{states by}} a general Dutch public. EQ- 5 D is a {{standardised}} questionnaire {{that is used}} to calculate quality-adjusted life-years for cost-utility analysis. DESIGN: Descriptive. METHOD: A sample of 309 Dutch adults from Rotterdam and surroundings was asked to value 17 EQ- 5 D health states using the time trade-off method. Regression analysis was applied to the valuations of these 17 health states. By means of the estimated regression coefficients, which together constitute the so-called Dutch <b>tariff,</b> <b>valuations</b> can be determined for all possible EQ- 5 D health states. These values reflect the relative desirability of health states on a scale where 1 refers to full health and 0 refers to death. Societal valuations are necessary in order to correct life-years for the quality of life. RESULTS: Complete data were obtained from 298 persons. Theywere representative for the Dutch population as far as age, gender and subjective health were concerned, but had a somewhat higher educational level. The estimated Dutch EQ- 5 D tariff revealed that the respondents assigned the most weight to (preventing) pain and anxiety or depression, followed by mobility, self-care and the activities of daily living. The Dutch tariff differed from the UK ('Measurement and <b>Valuation</b> of Health') <b>tariff,</b> which is currently used in Dutch cost-utility analyses. Compared to UK respondents, Dutch respondents assigned more weight to anxiety and depression and less weight to the other dimensions. Conclusion. The valuation of health states by this representative Dutch study group differed from the valuation that is currently used in Dutch cost-utility analyses...|$|R
40|$|We analize a {{discrete}} type {{version of a}} common agency model with informed principals of Martimort and Moreira (2005) {{in the context of}} lobby games. We begin discussing issues related to the common values nature of the model, i. e. the agent cares directly about the principal’s utility function. With this feature the equilibrium of Martimort and Moreira (2005) is not valid. We argue in favor of one solution, although we are not able to fully characterize the equilibrium in this context. We then turn to an application: a modification of the Grossman and Helpman (1994) model of lobbying for tariff protection to incoporate assimetric information (but disconsid-ering the problem of common values) in the lobbies objective function. We show that the main results of the original model do not hold and that lobbies may behave less agressively towards the police maker when there is private information in the lobbies <b>valuation</b> for the <b>tariffs.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The Common Commercial Policy is the {{essential}} basis of the European Union (hereinafter - the EU), which, in particular, is a free trade area between the 28 Member States with a common external customs tariff and a common foreign trade policy as well as common trade rules with the third countries. Implementation of this policy {{is characterized by the}} fact that it is based on an exclusive competence of the EU, which after the Treaty of Lisbon (2009) became even more apparent. Therefore the countries of the EU should follow the same legal principles and rules in the regulation of their foreign trade, that is to apply the uniform EU rules on the calculation of customs duties and determination of the customs origin of goods, customs <b>valuation</b> and <b>tariff</b> classification of goods (Common Customs Tariff). However, implementation of these provisions is always experiencing stress due to the different interests of the EU Member States and the different national practices, especially when the administration of customs duties is actually implemented only at the level of individual EU Member States. Therefore the aim of the article is to assess the implementation of the EU’s CCP from the perspective of the EU Member State (Lithuania) and to describe existing discrepancies which may serve as an obstacle for the development of common regulatory regime for import customs duties in the EU or hinder its main economic goals in international trade. Analysis of relevant scientific problems is mainly based on the comparative method (comparison of the practice of the national courts in the Republic of Lithuania and the Court of Justice of the European Union in disputes related to the functioning of the EU's customs union) and generalization of professional experience (national and EU judicial practice). The research leads to the conclusion that a uniform implementation of Common Commercial Policy and the Common Customs Tariff, as its main element, is not fully ensured on the practical level from the perspective of certain Member States (i. e. Lithuania) ...|$|R
40|$|In most OECD {{countries}} dial up internet accounts {{have typically}} been offered under two-part tariffs where connection and usage are charged separately. By contrast broadband accounts are typically offered under flat-rate tariffs. As consumers purchase internet accounts {{based upon their}} combined valuations {{of each of the}} connection and usage components it would be expected that different broadband tariff structures would result in different rates of broadband diffusion. As broadband is the successor to dial-up internet technology the diffusion rate will also depend upon the dial-up tariff structure. Using theories of two-part tariffs bundling and price discrimination this paper examines the effect of both dial-up and broadband tariff structures on broadband diffusion. Specifically flat-rate broadband tariffs slow the rate of diffusion relative to an optimal two-part tariff. Flat-rate tariffs prevail as a strategic means of extracting rents from early adopters with high connection values but low usage <b>valuations.</b> Flat-rate dial-up <b>tariffs</b> slow the rate of substitution to broadband via two mechanisms: a larger "connection gift" from bundling with voice telephony and a larger "usage gift" from usage beyond the point of marginal cost. Relative to an optimal two-part dial-up tariff the marginal substituter from flat-rate dial-up to broadband has both a higher connection valuation and a larger usage volume. Conversely two-part dial-up tariffs where usage subsidises connection result in earlier substitution to broadband as both the connection valuation and usage volumes are lower...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mapping disease-specific {{instruments}} into generic {{health outcomes}} or utility values is an expanding {{field of interest}} in health economics. This article constructs an algorithm to translate the modified Rankin scale (mRS) into EQ- 5 D utility values. METHODS: mRS and EQ- 5 D information was derived from stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients identified {{as part of the}} Oxford Vascular study (OXVASC). Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used to predict UK EQ- 5 D tariffs from mRS scores. An alternative method, using multinomial logistic regression with a Monte Carlo simulation approach (MLogit) to predict responses to each EQ- 5 D question, was also explored. The performance of the models was compared according to the magnitude of their predicted-to-actual mean EQ- 5 D tariff difference, their mean absolute and mean squared errors (MAE and MSE), and associated 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Out-of-sample validation was carried out in a subset of coronary disease and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) patients also identified as part of OXVASC but not used in the original estimation. RESULTS: The OLS and MLogit yielded similar MAE and MSE in the internal and external validation data sets. Both approaches also underestimated the uncertainty around the actual mean EQ- 5 D tariff producing tighter 95 % CIs in both data sets. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of algorithm will be dependent on the study aim. Individuals outside the United Kingdom may find it more useful to use the multinomial results, which can be used with different country-specific <b>tariff</b> <b>valuations.</b> However, these algorithms should not replace prospective collection of utility data...|$|R
