Nami's visa application has since been reviewed, and while he mentioned that Mushabib will be travelling with him, he listed his occupation as student but failed to provide an address for his school, and listed his intended address in the United States merely as Los Angeles - in the end he never used this visa to enter the United States, and reported his passport (C115007, which showed evidence of travel to Afghanistan) as [...] "lost", and procured a new one from Jeddah (C505363). He used the new passport to acquire a new B-1/B-2 visa in Jeddah on April 23, again recopying his answers from previously although crossing out the lines regarding Mushabib and previous attempts to acquire a visa. He was interviewed by a consular officer, who again approved his application. Records at the time only recorded past failures to procure a <b>visa,</b> so the <b>officer</b> had no way of realising that Nami had successfully received an earlier visa.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. M. (Security)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, Graduate School of Public and Development Management, 2013. Every {{country has}} the {{sovereign}} {{right to decide}} {{who may or may}} not enter its territory. Possession of a visa does not guarantee automatic admission to the Republic of South Africa (RSA). It only authorises the holder to proceed to the Republic to report to an immigration officer at a port of entry for the purpose of being examined as to his / her ability or otherwise, to comply with the entry requirements. The purpose of a visa on the one hand is to ensure proper screening of applicants so that undesirable persons are not admitted to the Republic and on the other hand to facilitate the entry of approved applicants at South African ports of entry. <b>Visa</b> provides immigration <b>officers</b> with the necessary information to ensure that applicants are admitted for the correct purpose and period into the RSA. Visa and immigration policy together determine who can come into South Africa for admission. This paper explores visa process at the South African High Commission in Swaziland in the context of national security. The survey for visa applicants and staff members at the mission was conducted in order to determine the challenges that are faced during visa processing. The paper concludes by putting forward suggested recommendations that can assist in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the visa process at the mission in the context of national security...|$|R

40|$|Before {{entering}} the United States for permanent or temporary residence, most noncitizens must complete {{a series of}} administrative procedures and background checks. The final {{step in the process}} is an interview with a consular officer in the noncitizen’s home country. That step, in most cases, determines whether a spouse can permanently rejoin her U. S. -citizen husband or wife in the United States or whether another immediate family member can permanently reside in the same home as her U. S. -citizen family member. After a consular officer decides to admit or deny entry to a noncitizen family member, there are limited opportunities for administrative or judicial review of the consular officer’s decision. For decades, federal courts have adhered to the doctrine of consular nonreviewability to limit judicial review of a consular <b>officer’s</b> <b>visa</b> decision. This doctrine, rooted in the legislative and the executive branches’ plenary power over immigration matters, first emerged in Kleindienst v. Mandel. Since then, federal courts have interpreted the doctrine—in some instances limiting the doctrine’s reach, and in others, allowing for more judicial review. In 2014, the U. S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in Din v. Kerry, a U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decision, which held that a visa denial impinges on a U. S. citizen’s constitutionally protected interest in her marriage to a noncitizen spouse. Without the opportunity for either an administrative appeal or judicial review of a visa denial, a single consular officer can force a U. S. citizen, like Mrs. Din, to live apart from her closest family member or to relinquish a stable life and employment in the United States to move abroad with her noncitizen family member. This Comment argues that the visa denial of a U. S. citizen’s family member implicates that citizen’s fundamental Fifth Amendment due process rights—therefore allowing judicial review of the denial—because the Supreme Court has long recognized the liberty interests involved in marriage and in living with one’s immediate and extended family...|$|R
50|$|In present, Bachu has two sons, Jignesh and Harish (Divyang Thakkar). Jignesh {{is married}} and expecting a child. The younger son, Harish, just like his father, dreams {{to go to the}} US, one way or another. Bachu wants to realize his own dream through his son. Harish applies for a visa, but is {{ultimately}} rejected due to his inability to give satisfactory answers to the <b>visa</b> <b>officer,</b> Derek Thomas (Tom Alter). Meanwhile, Ishwar returns to India with his daughter, Aayushi (Veronica Kalpana-Gautam). Ishwar is now very successful in the United States; he has a chain of motels and is now known as Motel King. His purpose is to invest in Gujarat and ultimately return to his motherland and settle there. Bachu still resents his old friend, but Harish falls in love with Aayushi, in spite of his father warning against it. Harish's friend, Raheel, introduces him to his acquaintance, Kaivan (who has changed his name to Kevin), who is soon going to the US, and introduces him to his travel agent, Daulatram Chainani (Rakesh Bedi). Chainani assures Harish and his father that he'll groom Harish and make sure he gets the visa, but will need money, to which his brother, Jignesh promises that he'll arrange for the money. Jignesh borrows money from anti-social elements, who are now threatening him unless he returns the money soon. In a party arranged by Kevin, one of his friends warns Aayushi about Kevin, saying that he is not a reliable man and is going to the US by using someone else's sponsorship papers. When drunk, Aayushi warns Harish about Kevin, but Harish dismisses her concerns. One day, Harish finds out about the illegal racket Chainani is running for illegal entry to the US. Chainani also reveals that Kevin used Harish's sponsorship papers to reach the US. When all hope is lost, one of Bachu's acquaintances informs him that he has managed a fake passport using which Harish can travel to the US; Bachu and Harish agree to that. Jignesh confronts his father for always shooting him down as dafol (stupid) and threatens to sever ties with the family and the same time there are complications in Jignesh's wife pregnancy and is admitted to the hospital.|$|E
