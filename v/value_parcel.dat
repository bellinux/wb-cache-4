40|$|The Meridian Township Land Preservation Programme is {{the first}} community-sponsored, open space and natural areas {{preservation}} programme in Michigan using ecological principles in the ranking of properties for acquisition. The programme was established through a collaborative, multi-stakeholder effort {{that resulted in a}} model ordinance, operating procedures, guidelines for landowners to nominate their properties for consideration, and a set of criteria for property selection. The screening criteria include ecological value, natural or functional <b>value,</b> <b>parcel</b> size, surrounding land use, environmental quality, and aesthetic value. The criteria were developed to reflect principles established by landscape ecology and land conservation objectives to maintain a maximum degree of biodiversity and to develop, manage and maintain ecological infrastructure through management of protected areas. The programme is entirely funded through a local millage, which will raise nearly $ 10 million over 10 years. The target for acquisition of open space is approximately 10 % of the currently undeveloped parcels in the township. ...|$|E
40|$|Imposing the GST on {{different}} types of imports has been a contentious topic for some time. Different parts of Australian society stand to benefit or lose significantly depending on how, or whether, the system is changed. This paper outlines the regulatory framework, including the relationship between online shopping and the low value threshold. Executive summary 	Australians spent $ 15. 7 billion in the year to August 2014 buying online from both international and Australian retailers. Online shopping by Australians has increased over time, {{and is likely to}} continue doing so. A significant portion of Australian purchases online are from Australian retailers. 	The low value threshold (LVT) exempts eligible imports below $ 1, 000 in value from a number of Commonwealth legal requirements. One of these exemptions is that goods below $ 1, 000 in value are generally not subject to the goods and services tax (GST). 	This LVT exemption enables international retailers to sell to Australian consumers without charging GST. This can contribute to a price differential between goods sold by Australian retailers and by international retailers, which can be a significant factor in consumer choices. To the extent that the LVT influences consumer choices (and thus reduces the impact of underlying market factors), it distorts competition between Australian and international retailers. 	The LVT is not indexed, and has remained at $ 1, 000 since 1985, losing value in real terms. If indexed, the threshold would be significantly higher. 	The majority of imported items below the LVT are quite low in value (many are less than $ 100). 	To collect GST on items below the LVT would require additional processing. The cost of this additional processing depends on the level at which a new threshold would apply—whether at zero, or some value between zero and $ 1, 000. 	Depending on the level at which a new threshold is applied, the cost of the additional processing required might be greater than the revenue raised, resulting in a net cost. This would reduce the GST revenue flowing to state and territory governments. 	A number of previous reviews have examined the issue: –      The Productivity Commission recommended in 2011 that the LVT not be lowered unless it was cost-effective to do so, and that further work be undertaken. –      The Low <b>Value</b> <b>Parcel</b> Processing Taskforce undertook more detailed research in 2012. They recommended further analysis, and that any goods which were subject to a lower GST threshold also be subject to border agency fees and charges. 	A number of countries apply fees and charges to incoming international mail items. These fees and charges cover the cost of processing, enabling governments to collect tax revenue on low-value items. 	Previous analysis suggests that removing the LVT (charging GST on all items) would have a very marginal negative impact on the economy overall, but would benefit the retail sector. 	The extent to which state and territory governments, household or retail sectors benefit or lose from changes would depend on the level at which the threshold is set, and whether fees and charges are used {{to cover the cost of}} processing...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{functional}} {{justifications for}} eminent domain involve bargaining problems, including the holdout problem, the bilateral monopoly problem and other transaction costs, {{as well as}} the existence of externalities. The holdout problem is particularly noteworthy, and this chapter analyzes three types of holdouts, depending on whether the failure in bargaining is the result of strategic behavior among owners, the presence {{of a large number of}} owners or a single owner who is unwilling to sell because of a highly idiosyncratic valuation. Although eminent domain solves any potential bargaining problems by transferring land directly from existing owners to the government, eminent domain has limitations as well. The primary limitations are the difficulty of <b>valuing</b> <b>parcels,</b> the potential for secondary rent seeking and the existence of administrative costs. <b>Valuing</b> <b>parcels</b> is especially problematic because, in the absence of perfect information, the government may underestimate the valuations of existing owners or overestimate the valuations of future owners. In either case, eminent domain may increase the likelihood of an undesirable transfer, i. e., a transfer in which the existing owners value the land more than the future owners, even if public officials are acting to maximize social welfare rather than advance their own, or other private, interests. Because of these limitations, scholars have proposed various alternatives for acquiring land, three of which I discuss below: (i) secret purchases; (ii) land assembly districts; and (iii) auction mechanisms. Comparing eminent domain with each of these alternatives is necessary to determine whether, or under what circumstances, it is desirable for the government to invoke eminent domain, a determination that ultimately depends on a number of important, yet relatively unexplored, empirical questions...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a quantifying model that predicts the appraised unit <b>value</b> of <b>parcels</b> in San Francisco County based on number of LEED-NC Public Transportation Access (PTA) qualified bus, light rail and commuter rail stops, distance to closest bus, light rail and commuter rail stops, zoning class and parcel size. As a population of interest, San Francisco County was chosen since it is known as a region having well-organized transportation systems including bus, light rail and commuter rail systems. According to the correlation results, for mixed zone, an appraised unit value increases as the number of LEED qualified transit stops increases (bus, light rail, and commuter rail). In addition, the appraised unit value increases as the distance to LEED qualified bus stops light rail stops decreases. For residential zone, the appraised unit value increases as the number of LEED qualified bus and light rail stations increases. Furthermore, the appraised unit value increases as the distance to LEED qualified bus stops decreases. When it comes to the predictive regression model for mixed zone, the adjusted R-square of the transformed model was 0. 713, which indicates that 71. 3 percent variability in transformed unit <b>value</b> of <b>parcels</b> could be explained by these variables. In addition, for the predictive model of residential zone, the adjusted R-square for the model was 0. 622 thus the independent variables together accounted for 62. 2 percent variability in the transformed unit <b>value</b> of <b>parcels.</b> The predicting models for mixed and residential zones were significant that suggests that the components of LEED-NC PTA criteria, number and distance from parcels, this could affect land development strategies. In addition, an appraised unit <b>value</b> of <b>parcels</b> in San Francisco County can be estimated by using the predictive models developed in this study.

With specific regard to urban land value theory and previous land value determinant studies, key determinants of commercial land value: accessibility, traffic flow, land use, population, and potential purchasing power were examined. Additional factors such as a commercial parcel's physical attributes were considered. In some instances, several forms of measurement of these spatial variables were utilized in an attempt to explain variation in <b>parcel</b> <b>values</b> along the study segment. Two models, graphics analysis and multiple linear regression and correlation analysis were applied for the purpose of identifying the relationships between the dependent variables, measures of <b>parcel</b> <b>value,</b> and the independent variables, the determinants of those value measures. The results of the regression analysis, (the graphic analysis having been deleted because of the limited utility and interpretational difficulties) revealed that measures of accessibility, represented by parcel distance from the nearby freeways and their interchange, and traffic flow along the boulevard and from major intersecting arterials exerted substantial influence on <b>parcel</b> <b>values.</b> The land use determinants generally contributed to these values in smaller increments while the population and potential purchasing power variables exerted little effect on <b>parcel</b> <b>values.</b> Also significant was the analytic substantiation of the observed variation between the type and intensity of commercial development characteristic of the east and west sections of the study segment.

The prioritization goal was riparian corridor conservation {{in terms of the}} following objectives: nutrient retention, significant natural area protection, and ease of funding. Each objective was measured using GIS-created attributes. Nutrient retention was assessed in terms of effective imperviousness, effective buffer, and bank control. Significant natural area protection was assessed in terms of the presence of the NC Natural Heritage Program’s Significant Natural Heritage Areas (SNHA) and biodiversity as indexed by the U. S.

Utility and weighting scores were calculated for each of these attributes and aggregated to create an overall prioritization value. The top five prioritization <b>value</b> <b>parcels</b> had little effective imperviousness, high biodiversity, and large parcel size for ease of funding.
