50|$|Toner {{particles}} have electrostatic properties {{by design}} and can develop static-electric charges when they rub against other particles, objects, or the interiors of transport systems and <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> <b>hoses.</b> Because {{of this and}} the small particle size, toner should not be vacuumed with a conventional home <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b> Static discharge from charged toner particles theoretically may ignite dust in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> bag or create a small explosion if sufficient toner is airborne. Toner particles are so fine that they are poorly filtered by household <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> filter bags and can blow through the vacuum motor into the room. So they also can cause overheat by clogging the motor filter and short circuit by their electric conductivity (carbon, iron) when they melt inside the motor.|$|R
2500|$|The best {{methods for}} dealing with H. axyridis in private homes involve sealing {{openings}} they may enter. Sweeping and vacuuming are considered effective methods for removing them from homes, though this should be done carefully {{so as not to}} trigger reflex bleeding. A nylon stocking placed inside the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner's</b> <b>hose,</b> secured with a rubber band, allows the beetles to be [...] "bagged" [...] rather than collected inside the machine. A trap designed for indoor use was developed which attracts the beetles with a light and seals them in a removable bag, though as the beetles are not strongly attracted to light, this does not work particularly well.|$|R

50|$|Excavations were resumed at the Walcott Quarry by the Geological Survey of Canada {{under the}} persuasion of {{trilobite}} expert Harry Blackmore Whittington, {{and a new}} quarry, the Raymond, was established about 20 metres higher up Fossil Ridge. Whittington, {{with the help of}} research students Derek Briggs and Simon Conway Morris of the University of Cambridge, began a thorough reassessment of the Burgess Shale, and revealed that the fauna represented were much more diverse and unusual than Walcott had recognized. Indeed, many of the animals present had bizarre anatomical features and only the slightest resemblance to other known animals. Examples include Opabinia, with five eyes and a snout like a <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> <b>hose</b> and Hallucigenia, which was originally reconstructed upside down, walking on bilaterally symmetrical spines.|$|E

She attributes her preference for foreign men to this experience. Another of her father's videos inspired Sena to begin masturbating with a vacuum cleaner. She recalls, [...] "I eventually did it so hard that my skin ripped and blood was going everywhere.

500|$|Opabinia {{looked so}} strange that the {{audience}} at the first presentation of Whittington's analysis laughed. The length of Opabinia regalis from head to tail ranged between [...] and [...] The animal also had a hollow proboscis, whose total length was {{about one-third of the}} body's and projected down from under the head and then curved forwards and upwards. The proboscis was [...] like a <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner's</b> <b>hose</b> and probably flexible, and it ended with a claw-like structure whose inner edges bore spines that projected inwards and forwards. The head bore five eyes: two on stalks near the front and fairly close {{to the middle of the}} head, pointing upwards and forwards; two larger eyes, also stalked, near the rear and outer edges of the head, pointing upwards and sideways; and a single eye with a shorter stalk between the larger pair of stalked eyes, pointing upwards. It has been assumed that the eyes were all compound, like arthropods' lateral eyes, but this reconstruction, which is not backed up by any evidence, is [...] "somewhat fanciful". The mouth was under the head, behind the proboscis, and pointed backwards, so that the digestive tract formed a U-bend on its way towards the rear of the animal. The proboscis appeared sufficiently long and flexible to reach the mouth.|$|R

50|$|The {{group was}} known for Thermos Malling's unusual {{instrumentation}} and inventions, and Bob Log III's unique finger picking style of guitar playing, as well as causing mini riots in any club they happened to be performing in. Guitarist and singer Bob Log III played an acoustic/electric slide homemade dobro, which sounded akin to an electrocuted McDowell on amphetamines, mixed with AC/DC. He also played a $2 thrift store guitar in a similar slide fashion which often left the sound men at the clubs where they performed at in awe at its wicked growl during sound check.

50|$|Some common {{malfunctions}} of dialysis catheters include clotting, infection, and kinking. One of {{the most}} common errors of tunnel hemodialysis catheter insertions is failure to locate the arterial limb of the catheter medially and the venous limb laterally. This must be done, because most catheters have a memory in the plastic, which will cause the catheter to try to resume its natural straight form. If the arterial limb is placed laterally, this will cause the arterial inlet to float up against the vein wall, or even up against the rim of the inlet of the atrium. This has the same effect as a <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> <b>hose</b> sucking up against curtains. This results in poor blood flows, and can force the dialysis staff to reverse flow, using the venous limb of the catheter as the arterial. This will result in more inefficient dialysis, as there will be admixing of blood from the catheter (cleaning the same blood, over again). A dialysis catheter must have infusion of 30cc or greater to keep the line open. IV fluids at 30cc per hr should be hung if being used for infusion.|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} of a {{small-scale}} piece {{of research that}} re-engaged with stakeholders in an earlier research project ('Leopard Skin Wellies, a Top Hat and a <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Cleaner</b> <b>Hose)</b> into the commencement of {{the first part of}} the Play Sufficiency Duty, Section 11 of the Children and Families (Wales) Measure 2010. The first project researched local authority approaches to the requirement to carry out Play Sufficiency Assessments (PSAs); this one looks back at what has happened since submission of the PSAs and forward to the commencement of the second part of the Duty. It continues to explore the complex relational and contingent particularities of the Play Sufficiency Duty recognising that 'the relationship between social policy and play is not straight forward. Play is not only an activity that takes place in discrete spaces and at prescribed times; it is not something that can simply be ‘provided’ by adults, but is an act of co-creation that emerges opportunistically from an assemblage of interdependent and interrelated factors. ' It also continues the themes used in LSW that drew on Ash Amin’s (2006) account of the good city, particularly his four registers of repair and maintenance, relatedness, rights and re-enchantment. These ideas can be readily adapted to form a framework for considering Wales as a play-friendly country (the ‘good country’, perhaps), and the four registers can be useful in looking at how they might combine to produce public spaces that are open to children’s playful presence. In particular, this report foregrounds the importance of supporting the development of ‘collective wisdom’ about children’s everyday playful relationships with their environments that builds on and goes beyond collection of ‘data’, embracing multiple ways of knowing that include local situated knowledge, stories, histories, relationships, affects, symbolic and material objects, intuitions and so on...|$|E

25|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> uses {{a partial}} vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors. Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented the first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper {{instead of a}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> his machine did, in fact, have a {{rotating}} brush like a traditional <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism {{on top of the}} body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> on July 10, 1860. Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the first electric <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who invented the motorized <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1899.

We used wet towelettes and a vacuum sampler to collect lead dust from carpets and upholstery before and after vacuum cleaning. The vacuum sampling data showed that the HEPA and non-HEPA <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> resulted in 54. 7 % (p = 0. 006) and 36. 4 % (p = 0. 020) reductions in lead loading, respectively, when used on soiled carpets, although the overall difference in lead loading reduction between the two <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> was not statistically significant (p = 0. 293).

5000|$|Many <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> {{also use}} HEPA filters {{as part of}} their {{filtration}} systems. This is beneficial for asthma and allergy sufferers, because the HEPA filter traps the fine particles (such as pollen and dust mite feces) which trigger allergy and asthma symptoms. For a HEPA filter in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> to be effective, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> must be designed so that all the air drawn into the machine is expelled through the filter, with none of the air leaking past it. This {{is often referred to as}} [...] "Sealed HEPA" [...] or sometimes the more vague [...] "True HEPA". <b>Vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> simply labeled [...] "HEPA" [...] may have a HEPA filter, but not all air necessarily passes through it. Finally, <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> filters marketed as [...] "HEPA-like" [...] will typically use a filter of a similar construction to HEPA, but without the filtering efficiency. Because of the extra density of a true HEPA filter, HEPA <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> require more powerful motors to provide adequate cleaning power.|$|R
