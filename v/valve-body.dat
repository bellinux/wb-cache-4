40|$|For millimeter-sized fluid-driven micromachines {{performing}} power-needed tasks, we {{proposed a}} novel micropump using fluid inertia in an outlet pipe. The paper describes the pump structure for higher output power and an application of the micropump to a micro fluid power system. First, a simple nonlinear mathematical model with lumped parameters was proposed and the validity was confirmed comparing the simulation and experimental results. Second, based on the simulations varying the sizes of the outlet pipe and the diaphragm, the pump structure for higher output power was obtained and the validity was verified through experiments. Finally, as an application of the micropump, a position control microsystem was fabricated using the micropump, a microvalve using magneto-rheological fluid <b>valve-body,</b> and a bellows microactuator. The characteristics were experimentally clarified and the validity was confirmed...|$|E
