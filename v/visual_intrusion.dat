Patients with posttraumatic stress disorder, other anxiety disorders, depression, eating disorders, and psychosis frequently report repeated <b>visual</b> <b>intrusions</b> corresponding to {{a small number of}} real or imaginary events, usually extremely vivid, detailed, and with highly distressing content. Both memory and imagery appear to rely on common networks involving medial prefrontal regions, posterior regions in the medial and lateral parietal cortices, the lateral temporal cortex, and the medial temporal lobe. Evidence from cognitive psychology and neuroscience implies distinct neural bases to abstract, flexible, contextualized representations (C-reps) and to inflexible, sensory-bound representations (S-reps). We revise our previous dual representation theory of posttraumatic stress disorder to place it within a neural systems model of healthy memory and imagery. The revised model is used to explain how the different types of distressing <b>visual</b> <b>intrusions</b> associated with clinical disorders arise, in terms of the need for correct interaction between the neural systems supporting S-reps and C-reps via visuospatial working memory. Finally, we discuss the treatment implications of the new model and relate it to existing forms of psychological therapy...|$|R

Intrusive memories commonly consisted of stimuli that were present immediately before the traumatic event happened or shortly before the moments that had the largest emotional impact (i. e., when the meaning of the event became more traumatic). It is suggested that intrusive memories are about stimuli that through temporal association with the trauma acquired the status of warning signals, i. e., stimuli that if encountered again would indicate impending danger. This explains why intrusive memories are accompanied by a sense of serious current threat. The warning signal hypothesis may be useful in guiding therapists in identifying the moments with the largest emotional impact that will need reprocessing in treatment, and in educating patients about the nature of reexperiencing symptoms...|$|R

50|$|The Friends filed {{a lawsuit}} on June 22, 2010 against AT&T to stop {{construction}} of a 450-foot telecommunications tower 15 miles east of Ely on the Fernberg Road. The tower would be lit at night and visible within the wilderness area, compromising the wilderness character of the area. The Friends case argued that {{the construction of an}} unlit 199-foot tower would serve residents of the area equally well, without intruding on the wilderness. In April 2011, the Friends, represented by a pro bono legal team from Robins Kaplan Miller & Ciresi, argued in Hennepin County District Court and in August the court ruled in favor of the Friends under the Minnesota Environmental Rights Act. AT&T appealed that decision, and the Minnesota Court of Appeals overturned the District Court in June 2012. The Minnesota Supreme Court declined to hear the case on appeal, and construction of the tower was completed in 2013. In response, the Friends announced that they would remain vigilant against other <b>visual</b> <b>intrusions</b> on the wilderness, and work with local governments to prevent similar towers from being constructed.|$|R
40|$|Background: Drug-facilitated {{sexual assault}} (DFSA) {{has emerged as}} a {{distinct}} category of sexual victimization and precipitates posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Few studies have examined the distinct psychological aspects of PTSD caused by DFSA. Gauntlett-Gilbert, Keegan and Petrak (2004) represent a notable exception and draw on cases, from their clinical experience, treated using Ehlers and Clarks’ (2000) cognitive therapy (CT). Aims: This paper aims to further develop and refine clinical knowledge on CT for PTSD arising from DFSA and advance the findings of Gauntlett-Gilbert et al. (2004). Method: Systematic case based research was used to investigate the applicability of CT for PTSD related to DFSA. Three survivors were treated with CT within the South African context. Results: The case series corroborated existing findings but also documented the presence of somatic and <b>visual</b> <b>intrusions</b> among survivors with partial or complete amnesia for rape and illustrated the utility of imagery interventions in targeting intrusions. The study highlighted the role of physical paralysis in DFSA in compounding helplessness/powerlessness and the necessity of enhancing physical agency and building social support. Conclusion: Distinctive aspects of PTSD related to DFSA can be effectively treated by adapting CT to suit this population group...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the overall performance of noise barriers in mitigating environmental impact of motorways, taking into consideration their effects on reducing noise and <b>visual</b> <b>intrusions</b> of moving traffic, but also potentially inducing visual impact themselves. A laboratory experiment was carried out, using computer-visualised video scenes and motorway traffic noise recordings to present experimental scenarios covering two traffic levels, two distances of receiver to road, two types of background landscape, and five barrier conditions including motorway only, motorway with tree belt, motorways with 3 m timber barrier, 5 m timber barrier, and 5 m transparent barrier. Responses from 30 participants of university students were gathered and perceived barrier performance analysed. The results show that noise barriers were always beneficial in mitigating environmental impact of motorways, or made no significant changes in environmental quality when the impact of motorways was low. Overall, barriers only offered similar mitigation effect as compared to tree belt, but showed some potential to be more advantageous when traffic level went high. 5 m timber barrier tended to perform better than the 3 m one at the distance of 300 m but not at 100 m possibly due to its negative visual effect when getting closer. The transparent barrier did not perform much differently from the timber barriers but tended {{to be the least}} effective in most scenarios. Some low positive correlations were found between aesthetic preference for barriers and environmental impact reduction by the barriers...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{recognition}} (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) of life-threatening illnesses as a stressor that can precipitate {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD), research has focussed {{on the issue of}} PTSD following cancer. Although the utility of a trauma framework has been questioned, understanding symptoms associated with PTSD such as intrusive cognitions may be critical in understanding psychological distress in cancer patients. Research has found that cancer patients experience negative intrusive thoughts, which are associated with marked distress. However, studies have rarely explored the content or nature of intrusions. In addition to verbal intrusions, intrusive memories of illness have been reported in cancer patients. More recently, intrusive imagery has been found in populations of anxious patients and reported to have a causal role in the maintenance of anxiety. Based on {{the recognition}} of cancer as a protracted experience involving multiple stressors, future-oriented <b>visual</b> <b>intrusions,</b> as well as intrusive memories and thoughts {{may play a role in}} psychological functioning. Chapter 1 is an overview of the literature assessing the presence of posttraumatic stress and posttraumatic stress symptoms in cancer patients. Chapter 2 is a cross-sectional study which showed that anxious prostate cancer patients (N= 65) were significantly more likely to report intrusive cognitions compared to matched non-anxious (N= 65) prostate cancer patients. Intrusive cognitions were frequent, uncontrollable and associated with significant distress and maladaptive adjustment. Chapter 3 is a cross-sectional study (N= 139), which showed that factors such as how patients appraise intrusive cognitions affects anxiety severity and intrusion-related distress, after controlling for intrusion frequency. Chapter 4 provides a discussion of the use of imagery in psychological therapy and how imagery has been used with cancer patients in therapy. Chapter 5 presents two single-case studies of cancer patients completing a short therapy for anxiety, imagery rescripting, aimed at reducing negative properties of intrusive cognitions whilst also alleviating anxiety and depression. The final chapter provides a general discussion of the thesis and presents ideas for future research. ...|$|R

The importance of feature selection lays on removing noisy, irrelevant and redundant data which can cause overload to the system. IDS faces very large amount of data which consists of many different features. Hence feature selection is used in order to select significant features which reduce unnecessary/noisy data. In feature selection two search algorithms; Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE) is s used to select significant features for the respective five categories of network traffics which are; Normal, Probe, Denial-of-Service (DoS), User-to-Root (U 2 R) and Remote-to-Local (R 2 L).

50|$|The final {{proposal}} for a lower Potomac dam was Seneca Dam. The concept developed in the 1950s and was proposed by the Corps of Engineers in its final form in the 1963 Potomac River Basin Report. Answering objections to the <b>visual</b> <b>intrusion</b> of the Riverbend Dam at Great Falls, Seneca Dam was placed at Blockhouse Point, about 1.6 mi downstream {{from the mouth of}} Seneca Creek, about 4.5 mi upstream from the Riverbend site and just downstream from the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal's Dam Number 2. No immediate hydroelectric development was planned, the dam was meant to provide a water source, to control floods, and to provide recreation. The Corps of Engineers assumed that water quality would continue to decline under the effects of upstream sewage discharge, especially during periods of low river flow, and opined that unless sewage was diverted by pipeline to the Chesapeake Bay, a dam would be necessary to dilute the effluent to an acceptable level. However, the Corps projected that the Seneca reservoir {{would not be able to}} assure sufficient water flow and quality without support from upstream dams on tributaries.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Naming {{deficit is}} a {{linguistic}} symptom {{that appears in}} the initial phase of Alzheimer&# 8217;s disease, but the types of naming errors {{and the ways in}} which this deficit changes over the course of the disease are unclear. We analyzed the performance of patients with Alzheimer&# 8217;s disease on naming tasks during the mild and moderate phases and verified how this linguistic skill deteriorates over the course of the disease. METHODS: A reduced version of the Boston Naming Test was administered to 30 patients with mild Alzheimer&# 8217;s disease, 30 patients with moderate Alzheimer&# 8217;s disease and 30 healthy controls. Errors were classified as verbal semantic paraphasia, verbal phonemic paraphasia, no response (pure anomia), circumlocution, unrelated verbal paraphasia, <b>visual</b> errors or <b>intrusion</b> errors. RESULTS: The patients with moderate Alzheimer&# 8217;s disease had significantly fewer correct answers than did both the control group and the group with mild Alzheimer&# 8217;s disease. With regard to the pattern of errors, verbal semantic paraphasia errors were the most frequent errors in all three groups. Additionally, as the disease severity increased, there was an increase in the number of no-response errors (pure anomia). The group with moderate Alzheimer&# 8217;s disease demonstrated a greater incidence of visual errors and unrelated verbal paraphasias compared with the other two groups and presented a more variable pattern of errors. CONCLUSIONS: Performance on nominative tasks worsened as the disease progressed in terms of both the quantity and the type of errors encountered.

40|$|Government {{agencies}} and corporations are growing increasingly reliant on networks for day-to-day operations including communication, data processing, and data storage. As a result, these networks {{are in a}} constant state of growth. These burgeoning networks cause the number of network security events requiring investigation to grow exceptionally, creating new problems for network security analysts. The increasing number of attacks propagated against high-value networks only increases the gravity. Therefore, security analysts need assistance to be able to continue to monitor network events at an acceptable rate. Network analysts rely on many different systems and tools to properly secure a network. One line of defense is an intrusion detection system or IDS. Intrusion detection systems monitor networks for suspicious activity and then print alerts to a log file. An important part of effective intrusion detection is finding relationships between network events, which allows for detection of network anomalies. However, network analysts typically monitor these logs in a sparsely formatted view, which simply isn’t effective for large networks. Therefore, a <b>Visual</b> <b>Intrusion</b> Detection System or VIDS is an interesting solution to aid network security analysts in properly securing the networks. The visualization tool takes a log file and represents the alerts on a three-dimensional graph. Previous research shows that humans have an innate ability to match patterns based on visual cues, which we hope will allow network analysts to match patterns between alerts and identify anomalies. In addition, the tool will leverage the user’s intuition and experience to aid intrusion detection by allowing them to manipulate the view of the data. The objective of this thesis is to quantify and measure the effectiveness of this <b>Visual</b> <b>Intrusion</b> Detection System built as an extension to the SNORT open source IDS.
