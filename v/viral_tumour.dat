40|$|For lymphocytes, {{the ability}} to undergo clonal {{expansion}} is crucial for effective immune function. Telomerase activity compensates for telomere erosion during cell division and contributes to the capability of lymphocytes to maintain cellular proliferation. In addition, telomerase activity may have {{a fundamental role in}} cell growth and survival. To determine whether age-related immune dysfunction is associated with an abnormality in telomerase activity, we investigated telomerase activity in T cell populations from young adult and aged mice. Our data show that the ability of T cells from aged mice to up-regulate telomerase activity after activation was significantly diminished. This age-related deficiency in telomerase induction is restricted to CD 4 + T cells, as CD 8 + T cells retain the capability to up-regulate telomerase activity. These findings reinforce the notion that age-related immune dysfunction results mainly from impairment of helper T cells, and may have important implications for designing novel means to improve immune responses in aged individuals by enhancing CD 8 + T cell functions, which are crucial in both <b>viral</b> and <b>tumour</b> immunity...|$|R

It is now well established that the products of several tumour supressor genes and oncogenes regulate a poptosis, and that the success of several anti-cancer treatments depend on apoptosis induction in tumour cells.

Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) induction treatment is a successful, but broadly reactive anti-lymphocyte therapy used in pancreas and islet transplantation. A more selective alternative is daclizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin- 2 receptor (CD 25) on activated lymphocytes. We tested the hypothesis that daclizumab is more selective and has less immunological side effects than ATG. Thirty-nine simultaneous pancreas–kidney transplantation patients with type 1 diabetes were randomized for induction therapy with ATG or daclizumab. Auto- and recall immunity was measured cross-sectionally by lymphocyte stimulation tests {{with a series of}} auto- and recall antigens in 35 successfully transplanted patients. T cell autoimmunity to islets was low in both groups, except for a marginal but significantly higher reactivity against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 in daclizumab-treated patients. The memory responses to recall antigens were significantly higher in the daclizumab-treated group compared to ATG-treated patients, specifically against purified protein derivative (PPD) (anti-bacterial immunity), Haemophilus influenzae virus matrix protein- 1 (anti-viral immunity) and p 53 [anti-tumour (auto) immunity]. These data imply that daclizumab is more specifically affecting diabetes-related immune responses than ATG.

Additionally, there is currently no general method for cloning antigen-specific effector T cells directly from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, {{without the need for}} prior expansion in vitro. Here we describe an efficient method for cloning effector T cells ex vivo. Functional T cells are detected using optimised interferon gamma capture following stimulation with <b>viral</b> or <b>tumour</b> cell-derived antigen. In combination with multiple phenotypic markers, single effector T cells are sorted using a flow cytometer directly into multi-well plates, and cloned using standard, non antigen-specific expansion methods.

40|$|Vaccinia virus (VV) {{has been}} used {{globally}} as a vaccine to eradicate smallpox. Widespread use of this viral vaccine has been tempered in recent years because of its immuno-evasive properties, with restrictions prohibiting VV inoculation of individuals with immune deficiencies or atopic skin diseases. VV infection is known to perturb several pathways for immune recognition including MHC class II (MHCII) and CD 1 d-restricted antigen presentation. MHCII and CD 1 d molecules associate with a conserved intracellular chaperone, CD 74, also known as invariant chain. Upon VV infection, cellular CD 74 levels are significantly reduced in antigen-presenting cells, consistent with the observed destabilization of MHCII molecules. In the current study, the ability of sustained CD 74 expression to overcome VV-induced suppression of antigen presentation was investigated. Viral inhibition of MHCII antigen presentation could be partially ameliorated by ectopic expression of CD 74 or by infection of cells with a recombinant VV encoding murine CD 74 (mCD 74 -VV). In contrast, virus-induced disruptions in CD 1 d-mediated antigen presentation persisted even with sustained CD 74 expression. Mice immunized with the recombinant mCD 74 -VV displayed greater protection during VV challenge and more robust anti-VV antibody responses. Together, these observations suggest that recombinant VV vaccines encoding CD 74 may be useful tools to improve CD 4 ⁺ T-cell responses to <b>viral</b> and <b>tumour</b> antigens...|$|R

40|$|Interferons (IFNs) {{are used}} widely in the {{treatment}} of <b>viral</b> infections, <b>tumours</b> and neurological disorders. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the endogenous expressions of various IFN-induced compounds [specifically: neopterin (NPT), beta 2 microglobulin (beta 2 mg) and 2 - 5 oligoadenylate synthetase (2 - 5 OAS) ] in patients with various chronic diseases requiring treatment with IFN type I. The results showed that patients with such chronic diseases as hepatitis C virus-associated type II mixed cryoglobulinaemia (MC), chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) are characterized by different activations of the IFN system. Furthermore, the interindividual variability in baseline levels of IFN-induced biomarkers was higher in patients with chronic diseases than in healthy individuals. When levels of the above biomarkers were measured 24 h after the first injection of IFN in patients with CHC or RRMS, significant increases in expression levels of IFN-induced compounds were recorded but, again, there is a broad range of variability in the degree of increase. Further, a significant inverse correlation between baseline levels of NPT, beta 2 mg and 2 - 5 OAS activity and their relative increases after IFN administration was found in patients with CHC or RRMS. Together, the results are consistent with the observation that there is considerable interindividual heterogeneity in the clinical response to IFNs, which suggests that host factors other than disease markers must be taken into account in order to manage and optimize the IFN therapy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{association}} between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) such as {{squamous cell carcinoma}} (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is not yet fully understood. We analysed the prevalence and spectrum of cutaneous beta-HPV types and mucosal/genital HPV types in paired biopsies (tumour and corresponding perilesional skin) obtained from 50 BCC immunocompetent patients. A small group of SCC patients (n= 9) was also included. We also evaluated some previously postulated risk factors for HPV infection in NMSC patients. Results All biopsies were negative for mucosal/genital HPV types. Overall, beta-HPV DNA was detected more often in SCC compared to BCC patients (78 % vs 55 % of total samples). The frequency of infection increased with the patient’s age [OR= 4. 88 (95 % CI 1. 29 - 18. 39) ]. There was no significant correlation between beta-HPV positivity and sex, skin type and UV exposure. The prevalence of beta-HPV species 1 types {{was significantly higher than}} those belonging to other beta-HPV species in biopsies from BCC (p= 0. 022) but not from SCC subjects (p= 0. 091). There {{was no significant difference in}} the overall prevalence of beta-HPV infection and the number of <b>viral</b> types between <b>tumour</b> lesions and perilesional skin. BCC samples were significantly more likely to be infected with beta-HPV species 1 types compared to perilesional skin (p= 0. 036) and showed a higher frequency of mixed infections (p= 0. 028). Conclusions These findings demonstrate that beta-HPV types belonging to species 1 are the most common HPV types detected in the skin of BCC patients. Moreover beta- 1 -HPV types and mixed infections are significantly more frequent in tumour samples than in healthy perilesional skin. Our results suggest that beta- 1 -HPVs as well as co-infection with more than one viral type could be important in NMSC and in particular in BCC. Further studies aimed to compare the biological activity of <b>viral</b> types in <b>tumours</b> and in healthy skin (viral replication and expression, interference of infection with cellular functions) are necessary to understand the role of HPV infection in skin cancer. </p...|$|R
40|$|Indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO; EC 1. 13. 11. 42) is a {{rate-limiting enzyme}} {{involved}} in the catabolism of tryptophan, which is an essential amino acid. It is induced under pathological conditions, such {{as the presence of}} <b>viral</b> infections or <b>tumour</b> cells. This enzyme is induced by IFN-γ in the mouse rectal carcinoma cell line CMT- 93. It is known that both 1 -methyl-l-tryptophan (1 -MT) and methylthiohydantoin-dl-tryptophan (MTH-trp) are tryptophan analogues, and are authentic inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of IDO. In this study, we examined the effects of both 1 -MT and MTH-trp on the IFN-γ inducible IDO expression of CMT- 93. As a result, the IFN-γ inducible IDO mRNA and the protein levels in CMT- 93 were suppressed by 1 -MT and MTH-trp, independently. Moreover, tryptophan (Trp), as a substrate of IDO, also suppressed IDO induction by IFN-γ at the transcriptional level. These results suggest that 1 -MT and MTH-trp are as inhibitors of IDO enzymatic activity, and Trp suppresses IDO induction by IFN-γ at the transcriptional level...|$|R
40|$|Bovine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (BHV- 1) is the aetiological {{agent of}} many disease types and may predispose infected animals, possibly through immunosuppression, to secondary bacterial infections. Immunosuppression may directly {{be associated with}} the induction of programmed cell death (PCD) in some virus-infected cells. Nitric oxide (NO) has an important mediating role against fungal, bacterial, protozoal, <b>viral</b> pathogens and <b>tumours.</b> BHV- 1 induced apoptosis between 0. 5 - 3 h postinfection (PI) in MDBK cells; however, between 3 and 6 h PI the PCD response was found to be decreased. It was interesting to see that BHV- 1 inhibited staurosporin-induced PCD after 1 h. These results showed similarities with those obtained from herpes simplex type 1 infections in human epithelial cells. PCD response decreased 1 h following caspase- 3 inhibitor applications, whereas NO response increased 3 h following infection in the presence of caspase- 8 and - 9 inhibitory peptides. In conclusion, BHV- 1 inhibited the staurosporin-induced apoptotic response and also the NO response. We propose that this inhibition is caspase- 3 dependent. ...|$|R
40|$|Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF) is a {{pleiotropic}} pro-inflammatory cytokine {{with known}} vascular permeabilising activity. It is employed during isolated limb perfusion to enhance delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs into tumour tissue.

Intravenous administration of TNF resulted in a 3 - to 6 -fold increase in EL 4 tumour uptake of Evans Blue/Albumin, adenovirus and long-circulating polymer coated adenovirus. Interestingly, endothelial permeabilisation could be suppressed in vitro and in vivo by Y- 27632, a Rho kinase inhibitor, without inhibiting viral infection.

Despite the obvious advantages of this approach – such as speed and cost efficiency – its success remains dependent on the accuracy of antigen prediction. Most approaches use sequence alignment to identify antigens. This is problematic for several reasons. Some proteins lack obvious sequence similarity, although they may share similar structures and biological properties. The antigenicity of a sequence may be encoded in a subtle and recondite manner not amendable to direct identification by sequence alignment. The discovery of truly novel antigens will be frustrated by their lack of similarity to antigens of known provenance. To overcome the limitations of alignment-dependent methods, we propose a new alignment-free approach for antigen prediction, {{which is based on}} auto cross covariance (ACC) transformation of protein sequences into uniform vectors of principal amino acid properties. Results - Bacterial, <b>viral</b> and <b>tumour</b> protein datasets were used to derive models for prediction of whole protein antigenicity.

40|$|ONE of {{the basic}} {{problems}} in the <b>viral</b> origin of <b>tumours</b> is the mode of virus transmission. Such transmission may take place {{from one generation to}} another to give the appearance of a hereditary transmission, and between animals belonging to the same generation.

Building on expertise in using polymer ‘stealthed’ viruses for targeting in vivo, adenovirus expressing luciferase (Adluc) was coated with an amino-reactive polymer based on poly [N-(2 -hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide] to ablate normal infection pathways. Direct linkage of a monoclonal antibody against E-selectin (MHES) demonstrated E-selectin-specific transduction of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) -activated endothelial cells.

Until recently, therapeutic efficacy was {{hindered by}} limited extravasation {{of the virus}} to poorly vascularized tumour regions and by liver toxicity beyond a certain dose. In the present work, co-injection of the virus with contrast agent microbubbles (SonoVue) and exposure of the tumour to ultrasound using a set of optimized parameters (0. 5 MHz, peak rarafactional pressure 1. 2 MPa, pulse length 50, 000 cycles, pulse repletion frequency 0. 5 Hz) result in inertial cavitation, which is found to enable increased extravasation and improved distribution of the virus throughout the tumour.

Our knowledge of the human nucleolar proteome has been expanded dramatically by the two recent MS studies on isolated nucleoli from HeLa cells [Andersen, Lyon, Fox, Leung, Lam, Steen, Mann and Lamond (2002) Curr. Biol. 12, 1 - 11; Scherl, Coute, Deon, Calle, Kindbeiter, Sanchez, Greco, Hochstrasser and Diaz (2002) Mol. Biol. Cell 13, 4100 - 4109]. Nearly 400 proteins were identified within the nucleolar proteome so far in humans. Approx. 12 % of the identified proteins were previously shown to be nucleolar in human cells and, as expected, nearly all of the known housekeeping proteins required for ribosome biogenesis were identified in these analyses. Surprisingly, approx. 30 % represented either novel or uncharacterized proteins. This review focuses on how to apply the derived knowledge of this newly recognized nucleolar proteome, such as their amino acid/peptide composition and their homologies across species, to explore the function and dynamics of the nucleolus, and suggests ways to identify, in silico, possible functions of the novel/uncharacterized proteins and potential interaction networks within the human nucleolus, or between the nucleolus and other nuclear organelles, by drawing resources from the public domain...|$|R
40|$|Background and PurposeMatrine {{is a small}} {{molecule}} drug used {{in humans}} {{for the treatment of}} chronic <b>viral</b> infections and <b>tumours</b> in the liver with little adverse effects. The present study investigated its therapeutic efficacy for insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in high-fat-fed mice. Experimental ApproachC 57 BL/J 6 mice were fed a chow or high-fat diet for 10 weeks and then treated with matrine or metformin for 4 weeks. The effects on lipid metabolism and glucose tolerance were evaluated. Key ResultsOur results first showed that matrine reduced glucose intolerance and plasma insulin level, hepatic triglyceride content and adiposity in high-fat-fed mice without affecting caloric intake. This reduction in hepatosteatosis was attributed to suppressed lipid synthesis and increased fatty acid oxidation. In contrast to metformin, matrine neither suppressed mitochondrial respiration nor activated AMPK in the liver. A computational docking simulation revealed HSP 90, a negative regulator of HSP 72, as a potential binding target of matrine. Consistent with the simulation results, matrine, but not metformin, increased the hepatic protein level of HSP 72 and this effect was inversely correlated with both liver triglyceride level and glucose intolerance. Conclusions and ImplicationsTaken together, these results indicate that matrine may be used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and hepatic steatosis, and the molecular action of this hepatoprotective drug involves the activation of HSP 72 in the liver...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A new virus {{called the}} Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV) has {{recently}} been found in Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC). MCC is a rare aggressive small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma primarily derived from the skin, morphologically indistinguishable from small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). So far the actual presence of the virus in MCC tumour cells on a morphological level has not been demonstrated, {{and the presence of}} MCPyV in other small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas has not been studied yet. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated MCC tissue samples from five patients and SCLCs from ten patients for the presence of MCPyV-DNA by PCR and sequencing. Electron microscopy was used to search ultrastructurally for morphological presence of the virus in MCPyV-DNA positive samples. MCPyV was detected in two out of five primary MCCs. In one MCC patient MCPyV-DNA was detected in the primary tumour {{as well as in the}} metastasis, strongly suggesting integration of MCPyV in the cellular DNA of the tumour in this patient. In the primary MCC of another patient <b>viral</b> particles in <b>tumour</b> cell nuclei and cytoplasm were identified by electron microscopy, indicating active viral replication in the tumour cells. In none of the SCLCs MCPyV-DNA was detected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results strongly suggest that MCPyV is an oncogenic polyomavirus in humans, and is potentially causally related to the development of MCC but not to the morphological similar SCLC...|$|R
40|$|Butel 1 From 1955 {{through early}} 1963, {{millions}} of people were inadvertently exposed to simian virus 40 (SV 40) as a contaminant of poliovirus vaccines; the virus had been present in the monkey kidney cultures used to prepare the vaccines and had escaped detection. SV 40 was discovered in 1960 and subsequently eliminated from poliovirus vaccines. This article reviews current knowledge about SV 40 and considers public responses to reports in the media. SV 40 is a potent tumour virus with broad tissue tropism that induces tumours in rodents and transforms cultured cells from many species. It {{is also an important}} laboratory model for basic studies of molecular processes in eukaryotic cells and mechanisms of neoplastic transformation. SV 40 neutralizing antibodies have been detected in individuals not exposed to contaminated poliovirus vaccines. There have been many reports of detection of SV 40 DNA in human tumours, especially mesotheliomas, brain tumours and osteosarcomas; and DNA sequence analyses have ruled out the possibility that the <b>viral</b> DNA in <b>tumours</b> was due to laboratory contamination or that the virus had been misidentified. However, additional studies are necessary to prove that SV 40 is the cause of certain human cancers. A recently published review article evaluated the status of the field and received much media attention. The public response emphasized that there is great interest in the possibility of health risks today from vaccinations received in the past...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} early {{acquisition}} upon the germ line, tolerance to the Gross (gs) virus is short-lived in the AKR. From {{about the age}} of 3 months anti-gs antibodies occur and these complex with the corresponding viral antigens. Such complexes are best seen in the glomeruli by means of immunofluorescence. In marked contrast to the AKR, renal complexes were minimal in a group of AKR reversible CBA/H-T 6 chimaeras derived by early embryo aggregation. This was particularly surprising since large numbers of type C murine leukaemia virus-like particles were identified in the chimaeras and the tissues were found to be saturated with gs antigen. The lack of renal antigen-antibody complexes was the first suggestion that anti-gs antibody might not be present in the chimaeras and renal elution studies here support this assumption. In contrast to the AKR where "split " renal eluates have been shown to have anti-gs activity, no activity was demonstrated in eluates from any of the chimaras. Tolerance to the oncogenic Gross virus in the chimaeras has to be attributed to the CBA parental strain component and since this component is also held responsible for the tumour resistance of these chimaeras, both phenomena could well be related. In this context it would appear that in the absence of masking by antibody <b>viral</b> antigenic complexes, <b>tumour</b> specific sites can be recognized in the chimaeras and unlike the AKR "normal" tumour immunity can be effected. This hypothesis is currently bei-ng tested...|$|R
40|$|Transplantation {{immunology}} {{has traditionally}} focused on adaptive, i. e., T- and B-cell reactions. More recently, natural killer (NK) cells were also recognised as playing {{an important role}} after transplantation of solid organs and haematopoietic stem cells. NK cells recognise "cell stress" induced by <b>viral</b> replication and <b>tumour</b> transformation via activating receptors, and are negatively regulated by the interaction between inhibitory molecules and autologous human leukocyte antigens (HLA). The most important inhibitory molecules belong {{to the family of}} killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). Differences in the inhibitory KIR/HLA interaction between stem cell donor and patient may lead to beneficial NK cell alloreactivity, resulting in specific graft-versus-tumour reactions, which occur in the absence of graft-versus-host disease. The immaturity of NK cells produced by the stem cell graft early after transplantation has led to different approaches of adoptive transfer of NK cells to further increase tumour control. The function and role of activating KIR receptors is less clear. Recent data have suggested, that activating KIR may also contribute to anti-tumour immunity after stem cell transplantation, as patients transplanted from donors carrying high numbers of activating KIR receptor genes show reduced relapse rates. In particular, protection from post-transplant disease relapse was demonstrated in transplants carried out from donors carrying the activating KIR 2 DS 1 receptor, if the recipients also expressed the KIR 2 DS 1 ligand HLA-C 2. In conclusion, NK cells have been firmly established {{in the last two decades}} as relevant players in transplant immunology, which can critically determine the outcome of haematopoietic stem cell grafts...|$|R
