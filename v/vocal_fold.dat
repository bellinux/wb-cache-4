25|$|Wound {{healing is}} a natural {{regeneration}} process of dermal and epidermal tissue involving a sequence of biochemical events. These events are complex and can be categorized into three stages: inflammation, proliferation and tissue remodeling. The study on <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> wound healing is not as extensive as that on animal models due to the limited availability of human vocal folds. <b>Vocal</b> <b>fold</b> injuries can {{have a number of}} causes including chronic overuse, chemical, thermal and mechanical trauma such as smoking, laryngeal cancer, and surgery.

50|$|The vocal {{apparatus}} {{consists of}} two pairs of mucosal folds.

Like newborns, the lamina propria appeared as a uniform structure. Some stellate cells were present in the macula flava, but started to show some signs of degeneration. The stellate cells synthesized fewer ECM molecules, and the cytoplasmic processes were shown to be short and shrinking, suggesting a decreased activity. Those results confirm the hypothesis that phonation stimulates stellate cells into producing more ECM.|$|E

25|$|The {{viscoelastic}} {{properties of}} human <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> lamina propria {{are essential for}} their vibration, and depend on the composition and structure of their extracellular matrix (ECM). Adult VF have a layered structure {{which is based on}} the layers differential in ECM distribution. Newborns on the other hand, do not have this layered structure. Their VF are uniform, and immature, making their viscoelastic properties most likely unsuitable for phonation. HA plays a very important role in the <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> biomechanics. In fact, HA has been described as the ECM molecule that not only contributes to the maintenance of an optimal tissue viscosity that allows phonation, but also of an optimal tissue stiffness that allows frequency control. CD44 is a cell surface receptor for HA. Cells such as fibroblasts are responsible for synthesizing ECM molecules. Cell surface matrix receptors in return, feed back to the cells through cell-matrix interaction, allowing the cell to regulate its metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Hirano et al. {{previously}} {{found that}} the newborns {{did not have a}} true lamina propria, but instead had cellular regions called maculae flavae, located at the anterior and posterior ends of the loose <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> tissue. Boseley and Hartnick examined at the development and maturation of pediatric human <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> lamina propria. Hartnick {{was the first one to}} define each layer by a change in their cellular concentration. He also {{found that the}} lamina propria monolayer at birth and shortly thereafter was hypercellular, thus confirming Hirano’s observations. By 2 months of age, the <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> started differentiating into a bilaminar structure of distinct cellular concentration, with the superficial layer being less densely populated than the deeper layer. By 11 months, a three-layered structure starts to be noted in some specimens, again with different cellular population densities. The superficial layer is still hypocellular, followed by an intermediate more hypercellular layer, and a deeper hypercellular layer, just above the vocalis muscle. Even though the VF seem to start organizing, this is not representative of the trilaminar structure seen in adult tissues, where the layer are defined by their differential elastin and collagen fiber compositions. By 7 years of age, all specimens show a three-layered <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> structure, based on cellular population densities. At this point, the superficial layer was still hypocellular, the middle layer was the hypercellualr one, with also a greater content of elastin and collagen fibers, and the deeper layer was less cellularly populated. Again, the distinction seen between the layers at this stage is not comparable to that seen in the adult tissue. The maturation of the VF did not appear before 13 years of age, where the layers could be defined by their differential fiber composition rather than by their differential cellular population. The pattern now show a hypocellular superficial layer, followed by a middle layer composed predominantly of elastin fiber, and a deeper layer composed predominantly of collagen fibers. This pattern can be seen in older specimens up to 17 years of age, and above. While this study offers a nice way to see the evolution from immature to mature VF, it still does not explain what is the mechanism behind it.|$|E

50|$|A {{unilateral}} injury of {{the nerve}} typically results in hoarseness {{caused by a}} reduced mobility {{of one of the}} <b>vocal</b> <b>folds.</b> It may also cause minor shortages of breath as well as aspiration problems especially concerning liquids. A bilateral injury causes the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> to impair the air flow resulting in breathing problems, stridor and snoring sounds, and fast physical exhaustion.

25|$|As for pitch {{contours}} {{in early}} infant utterances, infants between 3 and 9 {{months of age}} produce primarily flat, falling and rising-falling contours.

25|$|The hypohydrotic {{symptoms}} of ectodermal dysplasia described above are evidenced {{not only in}} the skin of affected individuals, but also in their phonation and voice production. Because the vocal folds may not be as hydrated as is necessary during the adduction phase of <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> vibration (due to lack of lubrication), a complete seal may not be accomplished between the folds and mucosal wave movement may be disrupted. This results in air escapement between the folds and the production of breathy voice, which often accompanies the skin abnormalities of ectodermal dysplasia.|$|E
25|$|In the infant, many fibrous {{components}} were seen to extend from the macula flava towards the Reinke's space. Fibronectin is very {{abundant in the}} Reinke's space of newborn and infant. Fibronectin is a glycoprotein that is believed {{to act as a}} template for the oriented deposition of the collagen fibers, stabilizing the collagen fibrils. Fibronectin also acts as a skeleton for the elastic tissue formation. Reticular and collagenous fibers were seen to run along the edges of the VF throughout the entire lamina propria. Fibronectin in the Reinke's space appeared to guide those fibers and orient the fibril deposition. The elastic fibers remained sparse and immature during infancy, mostly made of microfibrils. The fibroblasts in the infant Reinke's space were still sparse but spindle-shaped. Their rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus were still not well developed, indicating that despite the change in shape, the fibroblasts still remained mostly in a resting phase. Few newly released materials were seen adjacent to the fibroblasts. The ground substance content in the infant Reinke's space seemed to decrease over time, as the fibrous component content increased, thus slowly changing the <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> structure.|$|E
25|$|Human VF are paired {{structures}} {{located in}} the larynx, just above the trachea, which vibrate and are brought in contact during phonation. The human VF are roughly 12 – 24mm in length, and 3–5mm thick. Histologically, the human VF are a laminated structure composed of five different layers. The vocalis muscle, {{main body of the}} VF, is covered by the mucosa, which consists of the epithelium and the lamina propria. The latter is a pliable layer of connective tissue subdivided into three layers: the superficial layer (SLP), the intermediate layer (ILP), and the deep layer (DLP). Layer distinction is either made looking at differential in cell content or extracellular matrix (ECM) content. The most common way being to look at the ECM content. The SLP has fewer elastic and collagenous fibers than the two other layers, and thus is looser and more pliable. The ILP is mostly composed of elastic fibers, while the DLP has fewer elastic fibers, and more collagenous fibers. In those two layers, which form {{what is known as the}} vocalis ligament, the elastic and collagenous fibers are densely packed as bundles that run almost parallel to the edge of the <b>vocal</b> <b>fold.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Vocal</b> <b>folds</b> play {{a crucial}} role in voice production. The {{physiological}} vibrations of <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> depend on the unchanged multilayered structure of the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> mucosa. Morphological changes of mucosa are the cause of voice quality disorders &# 8212; dysphonia. The aim of this study was to determine the morphological base of dysphonia in patients with <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> atrophy. A group of 24 patients with larynx atrophy confirmed by endoscopic (VLS) and stroboscopic (VLSS) examination of the larynx was included in the study. The morphological assessment of the larynx mucosa was carried out with the use of the transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ultramorphological examinations revealed changes in the epithelium, basal membrane and lamina propria of the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> mucosa. An increased number of collagenous fibers, fibroblasts with signs of vacuolar degeneration inflammatory cells and a decreased number of blood vessels and pericytes were observed. Morphological changes found in the epithelium, basal membrane and lamina propria of the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> mucosa were the cause of disorders of <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> vibrations registered in the stroboscopic examination of the larynx (VLSS).

50|$|Abduction of the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> is {{important}} during physical exertion. The <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> {{are separated by}} about 8 mm during normal respiration, but this width is doubled during forced respiration.|$|R
25|$|Other {{studies suggest}} that hormones play also an {{important}} role in <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> maturation. Hormones are molecules secreted into the blood stream to be delivered at different targeted sites. They usually promote growth, differentiation and functionality in different organs or tissues. Their effect is due to their ability to bind to intracellular receptors, modulating the gene expression, and subsequently regulating protein synthesis. The interaction between the endocrine system and tissues such as breast, brain, testicles, heart, bones, etc., is being extensively studied. It has clearly been seen that the larynx is somewhat affected by hormonal changes, but surprisingly, very few studies are working on elucidating this relationship. The effect of hormonal changes in voice is clearly seen when hearing male and female voices, or when listening to a teenage voice changing during puberty. Actually, it is believed that the number of hormonal receptors in the pre-pubertal phase is higher than in any other age. Menstruation has also been seen to influence the voice. In fact, singers are encouraged by their instructors not to perform during their pre-menstrual period, because of a drop in their voice quality.|$|E
25|$|Manson {{became the}} band's chief {{songwriter}} for the follow-up record Version 2.0 which equalled {{the success of}} the band's debut record after its May 1998 release. During the two-year tour in support of the record, Manson modelled for Calvin Klein. Manson lived in hotels throughout the recording periods of the debut and Version 2.0. The group recorded the theme song to the James Bond movie The World Is Not Enough, and Manson became the third Scotswoman to sing a Bond theme after Lulu and Sheena Easton. In the accompanying video, she portrays an android assassin.

25|$|HA is a bulky, {{negatively}} charged glycosaminoglycan, whose strong affinity with water procures HA its viscoelastic and shock absorbing properties essential to vocal biomechanics. Viscosity and elasticity {{are critical to}} voice production. Chan, Gray and Titze, quantified the effect of HA on both the viscosity and the elasticity of vocal folds (VF) by comparing the properties of tissues with and without HA. The results showed that removal of HA decreased the stiffness of VF {{by an average of}} 35%, but increased their dynamic viscosity by an average of 70% at frequencies higher than 1Hz. Newborns have been shown to cry an average of 6.7 hours per day during the first 3 months, with a sustained pitch of 400–600Hz, and a mean duration per day of 2 hours. Similar treatment on adult VF would quickly result in edema, and subsequently aphonia. Schweinfurth and al. presented the hypothesis that high hyaluronic acid content and distribution in newborn VF is directly associated with newborn crying endurance. These differences in newborn <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> composition would also be responsible for newborns inability to articulate sounds, besides the fact that their lamina propria is a uniform structure with no vocal ligament. The layered structure necessary for phonation will start to develop during the infancy and until the adolescence.|$|E
50|$|Polyps on the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> {{can take}} on many {{different}} forms, and can sometimes result from vocal abuse, although {{this is not always}} the cause.

Most polyps are larger than nodules, which are more similar to callouses on the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds.</b>|$|R
50|$|The larynx or {{voice box}} is a {{cylindrical}} framework of cartilage that serves to anchor the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds.</b> When {{the muscles of}} the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> contract, the airflow from the lungs is impeded until the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> are forced apart again by the increasing air pressure from the lungs. The process continues in a periodic cycle that is felt as a vibration (buzzing). In singing, the vibration frequency of the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> determines the pitch of the sound produced. Voiced phonemes such as the pure vowels are, by definition, distinguished by the buzzing sound of this periodic oscillation of the vocal cords.|$|R
50|$|Phonation is the {{production}} of a periodic sound wave by vibration of the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds.</b> Airflow from the lungs, as well as laryngeal muscle contraction, causes movement of the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds.</b> It is the properties of tension and elasticity that allow the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> to be stretched, bunched, brought together and separated. During prephonation, the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> move from the abducted to adducted position. Subglottal pressure builds and air flow forces the folds apart, inferiorly to superiorly. If the volume of airflow is constant, the velocity of the flow will increase at the area of constriction and cause a decrease in pressure below once distributed. This negative pressure will pull the initially blow open folds back together again. The cycle repeats until the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> are abducted to inhibit phonation or to take a breath.|$|R
