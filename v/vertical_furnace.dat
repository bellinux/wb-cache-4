50|$|A {{project to}} {{manufacture}} the first Pakistani tank gun barrel {{was started by}} Pakistan's Strategic Plans Division (SPD) in 2000. In April 2011, {{it was reported that}} the first Pakistani-produced tank gun barrel was ready to be delivered to HIT for installation on the Al-Khalid and Al-Zarrar. Previously, HIT imported 125 mm gun barrel blanks from France for the two tanks which would then be machined in Pakistan by HIT. The first Pakistani gun barrel blank was produced at Heavy Mechanical Complex (HMC) in a joint project involving HIT, People's Steel Mills Limited (PSML) and other defence-related organisations. The specialist grade steel was produced at PSML and the resulting steel block was passed on to HMC. HMC then pressed the block to a length of 5 metres and square cross-section, before forging it into a 125 mm smoothbore barrel. The barrel was then heat treated several times in facilities such as a large <b>vertical</b> <b>furnace.</b> The process took 2-3 months and was watched by experts from other defence-related organisations. The barrel was to be capable of firing at 4 rounds per minute as well as being compatible with the autoloader and its 24-round magazine. According to a HIT official, a joint team proved to the Pakistan Army that strict standards would be met before the army approved production of a first batch of 50 gun barrels by HMC. The Pakistani gun barrels would likely be installed on upgraded versions of the Al-Khalid which are under development by HIT. A Rs200 million PKR contract has been finalised by HIT for the first 50 barrel batch, which is slightly lower than the barrels imported from France. After production of the first batch of local tank gun barrels in 2011, Heavy Machinery Complex is planning to explore manufacture of artillery guns.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>furnaces</b> stand {{higher than}} {{horizontal}} furnaces, {{so they may}} not fit into some microfabrication facilities. However, they help to prevent dust contamination. Unlike horizontal furnaces, in which falling dust can contaminate any wafer, <b>vertical</b> <b>furnaces</b> use enclosed cabinets with air filtration systems to prevent dust from reaching the wafers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>furnaces</b> {{also allow}} {{the use of}} load locks to purge the wafers with {{nitrogen}} before oxidation to limit the growth of native oxide on the Si surface.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>furnaces</b> also {{eliminate}} {{an issue}} that plagued horizontal furnaces: non-uniformity of grown oxide across the wafer. Horizontal furnaces typically have convection currents inside the tube which causes {{the bottom of the}} tube to be slightly colder than the top of the tube. As the wafers lie vertically in the tube the convection and the temperature gradient with it causes the top of the wafer to have a thicker oxide than the bottom of the wafer. <b>Vertical</b> <b>furnaces</b> solve this problem by having wafer sitting horizontally, and then having the gas flow in the furnace flowing from top to bottom, significantly damping any thermal convections.|$|R

40|$|A spectroscopic {{ellipsometer}} was {{integrated in}} a <b>vertical</b> <b>furnace</b> for {{measurement and control}} during chemical vapor deposition and thermal oxidation processes. The major goal of this activity was to adapt the ellipsometer arrangement to the furnace geometry with a minimum impact on the furnace process performance.

This aim led to a novel beam-guiding system.

40|$|OVERVIEW: The {{increasing}} {{sophistication of}} home electronics and telecommunication devices is propelling {{the demand for}} improved semiconductor devices. The SiGe (silicon germanium) -HBT (hetero-junction bipolar transistor) can realize high-speed operation, low noise, and low power consumption, therefore, its expected application to radio frequency IC communication devices is predicted to grow rapidly. 1) SiGe can also be applied to strained-Si channels, 2, 3) which {{are responsible for the}} high performance of CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) -LSIs (large-scale integrated circuits). SiGe-based devices are expected to be widely adopted, therefore, demand for a SiGe epitaxial growth system having high productivity is getting greater. In a timely response to this demand, Hitachi is moving forward with the development of an ultra-clean low-pressure CVD (chemical vapor deposition) <b>vertical</b> <b>furnace</b> for batch SiGe epitaxial growth. This batch-type <b>vertical</b> <b>furnace</b> system is able to process upto 50 wafers (200 -mm diameter) at a time and it is capable of high-quality SiGe epitaxial growth at low temperatures (500 °C) in an extremely clean ambient. A rapid ramp up/down heater has been adopted to reduce the heating and cooling times to acquire excellent crystallinity and high throughput...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time, a spectroscopic {{ellipsometer}} (SE) has been {{integrated into a}} <b>vertical</b> <b>furnace</b> {{to use it as}} an in situ layer thickness sensor. An SE was selected because of its high accuracy and versatility. In the <b>vertical</b> <b>furnace,</b> the SE can be used for in situ sensing of the layer growth as well as for post process control of the batch. The adaptation of the SE to the furnace was performed with minor modifications of the furnace geometry. The light beam of the SE is guided through the base plate into the furnace tube and directed onto the wafer by quartz glass prisms operating in total internal reflection mode. This arrangement introduces an additional phase shift in the polarization state of the light which can be determined and subtracted from the measured phase shift. For in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry at high-temperature process steps the exact knowledge of the spectral refractice indices of the measured substrate and layer materials is of crucial importance. As there is still a lack of optical data as a function of temperature reported in the literature, these optical data of some relevant materials have been determined at high temperatures to make in situ measurement possible. The determination of this refractive indices was done with the in situ SE in the <b>vertical</b> <b>furnace</b> that ensures accurate temperature control and temperature homogeneity on the wafer up to 9000 C. With the knowledge of this refractive indices the SE can be used for in situ end point detection during layer growth. As the arrangement of the in situ SE enables also post process measurements on selected wafers of the batch during the unloading sequence, in situ and post process data can be used by an integrated novel furnace control system for immediate and automated correction of the parameter settings. The advantage of this integrated in situ SE such as time reduction for process optimization, avoidance of monitor wafers, and a better control of integrated multilayer processing can be beneficial for future thermal processing...|$|E
