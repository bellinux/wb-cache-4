40|$|Recently, a {{new type}} of camera, which allows the {{recording}} of almost the entire range of luminosity of the acquired scene, has been introduced to the market. The produced High Dynamic Range images (HDRi), can simplify some <b>video-surveillance</b> tasks, such as object detection, recognition an tracking, since they can simultaneously capture the visual scene content of both dark and bright areas. Applications where lighting conditions cannot be controlled can greatly benet from the adoption of HDR cameras. For example, the achievement of a good and constant visual quality of images {{is one of the key}} aspects in <b>video-surveillance</b> applications, because it allows to robustly detect salient events in the captured scenes. However, the use of HDR images in traditional <b>video-surveillance</b> systems requires the reduction of their dynamic range appropriately, by applying a tone mapping operator. In this paper a fast method for tone mapping HDR videos, which combines the benets of both local and global operators, is presented. It is applied in the context of object detection and tracking. It also enhances the visual quality of the image in all light conditions, which facilitated surveillance tasks for both human and automatic operators...|$|E

40|$|International audienceVideo-surveillance {{attracted}} {{an important}} research {{effort in the}} last few years. Many works are dedicated to the design of efficient systems and the development of robust algorithms. video compression is a very important stage in order to ensure the viability of <b>video-surveillance</b> systems. However, it introduces some distortions decreasing significantly the detection, recognition and identification tasks for legal investigators. Fortunately, an important effort is made in terms of standard definition for <b>video-surveillance</b> in order to achieve to a complete interoperability. However, quality issues are still not addressed in an appropriate way. Investigators are often facing the dilemma of selecting the best match (legal evidence) of the targeted object in the video-sequence. In this paper, we propose an offline quality monitoring system for the extraction of most suitable legal evidence images for <b>video-surveillance</b> applications. This system is constructed around three innovative parts: First, a robust tracking algorithm based on foveal wavelet and mean shift. Second, a no-reference quality metric based on sharpness feature. Finally, a super-resolution algorithm allowing to increase the size of the tracked object without using any information outside the image itself. The combination of the proposed algorithms allowed the construction of a quality monitoring system increasing significantly the efficiency of the legal evidence image extraction...|$|E
