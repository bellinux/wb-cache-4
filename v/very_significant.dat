5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in <b>very</b> <b>significant</b> reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E

40|$|Aim of work :- This {{research}} aims {{to study}} some cases of medical malpractice and provides guidance for medical persons to minimize or even avoid medical malpractice among Yemenis. Subjects and Methods:- This first study in Yemen {{was done on}} hundred cases of medical malpractice during surgery that were collected randomly through {{the last ten years}} (1996 - 2005) from many places in Yemen. All cases were aging from 3 to 70 years old. The gender of patient was 54 males and 46 females. Results:-This study showed highly significant increase of number of cases between ages 21 - 30, 41 - 50 and 51 - 60 in both sexes as compared to other groups of age, while ages 11 - 20 and 31 - 40 showed significant increase in number of malpractice cases versus age 61 - 70 years. No significant difference between females and males among the studied cases. There was <b>very</b> highly statistical <b>significant</b> increase of number of malpractices that done by one physician when compared to that done by two or three physicians. There was <b>very</b> highly <b>significant</b> increase in number of malpractice cases in public hospital versus other hospitals and in private hospitals versus academic hospitals. Positive cases of medical malpractice were very highly significantly decreased as compared to negative one in public and private hospitals & no significant difference between positive and negative cases in academic hospitals. There was <b>very</b> highly <b>significant</b> increase in number of malpractice cases among specialists as compare to university staff and consultant. There was no statistical significant difference between university staff and consultants. There was also <b>very</b> highly <b>significant</b> increase in number of negative cases among university staff and specialists, but significant increase of negative cases as compared to positive cases was seen among consultants. This study proved that the general surgery showed <b>very</b> highly <b>significant</b> increase in number of malpractice cases versus other groups. Urology showed significant increase in number of malpractice cases versus internal medicine and neurosurgery. It was demonstrated <b>very</b> highly <b>significant</b> increase in number of malpractice cases during intra-operative and post-operative stages versus other stages. Appendicectomy and cholecystectomy showed <b>very</b> highly <b>significant</b> increase in number of malpractice cases versus other types of operations.

5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century Stretford was {{a largely}} {{agricultural}} village. The development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town, beginning in the late 19th century, had a significant effect on Stretford's subsequent development. At its peak in 1945 the park employed an estimated 75,000workers; housing and other amenities had to be constructed on what had previously been agricultural land. Trafford Park is still a <b>very</b> <b>significant</b> source of employment, containing an estimated 1,400 companies and employing about 44,000 people. As at the 2001 UK census, 0.3% of Stretford's working population was employed in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Across {{languages}} and letters, the average {{probability of a}} letter being chosen {{as one of the}} six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the effect was present but not to a significant degree. The effect was also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as <b>very</b> <b>significant</b> in all languages when only initials were considered. There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.|$|E

5|$|Mating {{occurs on}} dry land, but the females {{return to the}} edge of the sea to release their fertilised eggs and then retreat back up the beach. The larvae that hatch are planktonic for 3–4 weeks, before {{settling}} to the sea floor, entering a gastropod shell and returning to dry land. Sexual maturity is reached after about 5 years, and the total lifespan may be over 60 years. In the 3–4 weeks that the larvae remain in the sea their chance of reaching another suitable location will be enhanced if they find a floating life support system. It is commonly agreed that floating logs or rafts of storm-struck vegetation would be suitable, although rather chancy and definitely seasonal. In contrast, floating coconuts can be a <b>very</b> <b>significant</b> part of the crab's dispersal options.|$|E
5|$|The West Cornwall covered {{bridge is}} <b>very</b> <b>significant</b> and {{important}} {{as one of}} only three surviving covered bridges in the state of Connecticut. The bridge's modification from the original Town lattice represents a unique design that is not repeated in either the Comstock's Bridge or Bull's Bridge. The covered bridge is perhaps best known for being featured on postcards of New England villages. Terry Miller and Ronald Knapp assert that Charles Ives passed by the bridge {{on the way to the}} Berkshires which inspired the third movement in the Three Places in New England. The bridge appeared in the opening scenes of the movie, Valley of the Dolls a 1967 American drama film based on the 1966 novel of the same name by Jacqueline Susann. This brief scene occurs near the 2 minute mark of the film, during the opening credits. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.|$|E

This battle was for control of a territory in Northeastern Iraq that was completely occupied by Ansar Al Islam, an ally of Al Qaeda.

This battle may have been the Tora Bora of Iraq, but it was a sound defeat for Al Qaeda and their ally Ansar Al Islam. This combined team then led the Peshmerga against Saddam's northern Army. This effort kept Saddam's forces in the north and denied the ability to redeploy to contest the invasion force coming from the south.
