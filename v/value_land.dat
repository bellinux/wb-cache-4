50|$|The Henry George theorem, {{named for}} 19th century U.S. {{political}} economist and activist Henry George, states that under certain conditions, aggregate spending by government on public goods will increase aggregate rent based on land <b>value</b> (<b>land</b> rent) {{more than that}} amount, {{with the benefit of}} the last marginal investment equaling its cost. This general relationship, first noted by the French physiocrats in the 18th century, is one basis for advocating the collection of a tax based on land rents to help defray the cost of public investment that helps create land values. Henry George popularized this method of raising public revenue in his works (especially in Progress and Poverty), which launched the 'single tax' movement.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{valuation}} {{data from}} Quotable Value New Zealand to examine {{changes in the}} value of the rural land in New Zealand between 1989 and 2003. The <b>value</b> of rural <b>land</b> reflects the profitability of agriculture as well as the returns to alternative land uses, and has a large impact on the prosperity of rural areas. The paper highlights the importance of both changes in land use and changes in the <b>value</b> of <b>land</b> in different uses in explaining overall changes in <b>land</b> <b>values.</b> It also examines the relationship among productive characteristics of the land, the local climate, various local amenities, and changes in <b>land</b> <b>values</b> and <b>land</b> use to better understand what factors have been driving overall changes in the <b>value</b> of rural <b>land</b> across New Zealand. We find that the real <b>value</b> of rural <b>land</b> in all uses increased substantially over the years being examined. Land use in rural areas also changed considerably during this period, but these changes in land use were essentially uncorrelated with changes in <b>land</b> <b>values.</b> Our regression results indicate that rural <b>land</b> <b>values</b> increased the most in less populated areas with good climates and local amenities. Initial land use also plays an important role in explaining the variation in changes in rural <b>land</b> <b>values</b> with greater increases in <b>land</b> <b>values</b> found in areas with more land initially devoted to urban uses and commercial forestry, and less land initially devoted to horticulture and lifestyle uses. <b>Land</b> Use, <b>Land</b> <b>Value,</b> New Zealand, Rural Areas...|$|R
