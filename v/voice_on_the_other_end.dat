5|$|The game is set after {{a fictional}} World War III, {{the events of}} which have killed off much of the population; those left alive are forced to fight for survival. Some of the {{survivors}} have formed gangs, some turned into mutants from the war's radiation, and some joined an evil militia; collectively, these groups are known as Wastelanders. Raiding different towns and villages, the Wastelanders sought to prey on the townspeople by stealing supplies, forcing some into slavery, and killing others. The heroine of the story, Angel, travels {{from town to town}} in search of her lost friend, Ekx, while helping the town's survivors fend off attacks from Wastelanders. Cruising in her armored car, Gypsy, she makes use of the car's mounted machine guns to defend the towns from thieves and slavers. The first lead Angel finds on her lost friend is from the city of Core, where Ekx was seen traveling through the city on his way to Coalhaven. Angel reaches Coalhaven and uses her armored car to defend the city from members of the renegade militia. After repelling the enemy, the townspeople re-establish their wireless communications and contact the nearby city of New Dallas. Recognizing the <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> the receiving operator in New Dallas turns out to be Angel's lost friend, Ekx. Ekx confides in Angel that he needs her for something urgent and that she must join him in New Dallas.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{recognizing}} the <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> Remer {{realizes that the}} Reserve Army has been duped—rather than containing a coup, they have unwittingly supported it. SS officers are released and the plotters in turn are besieged inside the Bendlerblock. The headquarters staff flees, but the resistance leaders are arrested. In an ultimately vain effort to save himself, General Fromm convenes an impromptu court martial, places Beck under arrest, and sentences Von Quirnheim, Olbricht, Haeften, and Stauffenberg to death, contravening Hitler's orders that they be kept alive. Given a pistol by Fromm, Beck commits suicide. That night, the ringleaders are then executed by firing squad one by one. Some distance away, General Von Tresckow commits suicide with a grenade. When Stauffenberg {{is about to be}} shot, in a last gesture of loyalty and defiance, Haeften places himself {{in the path of the}} bullets meant for Stauffenberg. When his turn arrives, Colonel Stauffenberg's last act is to cry [...] "Long live sacred Germany!" ...|$|E
500|$|Germans {{entered the}} home that Creger and Slape were using as an {{observation}} post. Slape {{climbed into the}} attic, while Creger only had time to hide behind a door. He pulled the pin on a grenade as the door knob jammed into his ribs. Bullets from the I&R platoon struck the building, and the Germans suddenly left. Creger and Slape exited {{by the back door}} and ducked into a nearby cowshed. They crossed a field and then found themselves in a minefield. Picking their way forward, they circled through the woods until they encountered a handful of Germans. Opening fire, they killed them. Creger and Slape spotted Bouck and Milosevich across the road and sprinted towards them, drawing German fire. They made it back to their ridge-top position and Bouck called Regimental Headquarters. He requested artillery support, but when he reported the German column advancing on his position, the <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> of the radio told him [...] "he must be seeing things". Bouck told them he had 20-20 vision and demanded artillery fire on the road in front of his unit.|$|E

500|$|Wu {{was known}} for posting humorous videos on YouTube. When Wu's [...] "I Have to Deal With Stereotypes" [...] video was {{featured}} on YouTube's home page, his number of viewers began to increase. In this video, Wu talks about stereotypes he {{has to deal with}} as an Asian-American. He tries to disprove his cheapness by bragging about the recent purchase of a [...] "brand new, top-of-the-line, TI-84 calculator". He acknowledges that this might make him nerdy but dismisses this stereotype too as he does not [...] "make all A's...in school today [...] made a B+." [...] He is then greeted by a voice {{that was supposed to be}} his mother calling him a loser and accusing him of dishonoring their family. Wu goes on to say he can prove his predominant social life with the constant ringing of his cell phone. At this point, his phone indeed rings, he answers it, and the <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> to Wu's disappointment says, [...] "Hey, why did you tell me to call you?" [...] Wu has collaborated with fellow YouTube comedian Christine Gambito (HappySlip), making five videos with her. In one of Kevin's older videos, he said he was an only child, which was later proven wrong by his father.|$|E

60|$|Once on deck {{they stood}} {{perfectly}} quiet, listening. Presently {{they heard a}} murmur of <b>voices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of <b>the</b> vessel. Very quietly they crept towards the sound, and at length made out two figures leaning over the bulwarks, talking.|$|R
5000|$|Ralston {{provides}} {{his voice}} on The Simpsons episode [...] "Treehouse of Horror XXII" [...] as the <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> of Homer's phone {{when he calls}} for help after getting trapped {{in a similar situation}} to Ralston himself.

5000|$|As Keith Richards tells it, Jones came up {{with the}} name the [...] "Rollin' Stones" [...] (later with the 'g') while on the phone with a venue owner. [...] "The <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> of the line {{obviously}} said, 'What are you called?' Panic!

5000|$|The {{story begins}} with Dr. Max Greitzer waking {{to the sound}} of his telephone. <b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> line tells him that a woman he'd dated previously, Liza Nestling, had died and that the funeral was to be held at eleven.|$|R
50|$|Exit {{and voice}} {{themselves}} represent a union between {{economic and political}} action. Exit is associated with Adam Smith's invisible hand, in which buyers and sellers are free to move silently through the market, constantly forming and destroying relationships. <b>Voice,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, is by nature political and at times confrontational.|$|R

5000|$|On the EP cover, {{the number}} 1426148550 is given. It was a working UK {{telephone}} number, and the <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> which simply said, [...] "Hello?" [...] {{was that of}} Radiohead singer Thom Yorke. Fans could even leave a message, {{and some of the}} content was used in later productions. This number has been disconnected for years. Calling it, as of 2016, yields BT's standard [...] "The number you have dialed has not been recognised" [...] message.

5000|$|Wealthy {{housewife}} and children's author Cathryn (Susannah York) {{receives a}} series of disturbing and eerie phone calls in her home in London one dreary night. The female <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> sometimes cutting in on other phone conversations, suggests mockingly to her that her husband Hugh (René Auberjonois) is having an affair. Cathryn's husband comes home, finding her in complete disarray. Hugh attempts to comfort her, but then he is gone, and she sees a different man who {{is behaving as if}} he were her husband.

5000|$|Woody calls Gorgeous Gal {{and hears}} a sultry <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> of the phone.

The spring in his step is all but {{shattered}} when he finally gets a good look at her: Gorgeous Gal is an overweight, heavily jeweled and overdressed bird who is much older than Woody. Upon hearing the words [...] "Hello cutie pie. Your Gorgeous Gal is waiting," [...] Woody's feathers turn white and he passes out.|$|E
5000|$|I was {{painting}} my mom's house in Ontario {{when the phone}} rang. The <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> said it was Cardinal Bertone, and {{my first thought was}} that it was a prank, … you know, I thought maybe {{it was one of the}} Redemptorists fooling around. Quickly, though, I realized that it really was Bertone, and he said that the Holy Father wants you to do this. My first reaction was to tell him that off the top of my head, I could give him the names of five people much more qualified to do this job than I am. I was completely serious about it. But Cardinal Bertone said no, this is what the Holy Father wants. He said I could take a week to ten days to think about it, so I talked to my superiors, my closest friends in religious life, and my spiritual director.|$|E
50|$|Mixed methods capitalizes <b>on</b> maximizing <b>the</b> {{strengths}} of {{qualitative and quantitative}} research and minimizing their individual weaknesses by combining both data. Quantitative research is criticized for not considering contexts, having a lack of depth and not giving participants a <b>voice.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, qualitative research is criticized for smaller sample sizes, possible researcher bias {{and a lack of}} generalizability.|$|R
50|$|In many cases, {{there is}} a {{semantic}} overlap between impersonal/anticausative/autocausative constructs and the passive voice (also present in all Romance and Slavic languages).

60|$|When he had {{finished}} his search, he {{came down to the}} ground floor and entered the room corresponding with the one from which he had heard voices in the adjoining house.

5000|$|A {{short while}} later, {{he hears a}} phone ringing and goes into a {{classroom}} to investigate. He finds a teacher's phone in her desk and answers it to hear a stranger's <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end.</b> After a few moments, with the voice asking Joe who he is, it urges him {{to find a place}} to hide. It is too late though, as a man with a rifle enters the room with bloodstains on his clothes. Joe, not understanding the situation, asks the man if he is injured, and the man begins talking about how life is meant to be able to go in any direction you choose, but in reality it doesn't [...] "You can't turn 65 cents into a dollar." [...] Joe notices a laser dot on his forehead, and the man is quickly shot and killed by police who flood the room, grabbing up Joe, and checking that the man who took over the school and possibly killed a teacher is dead.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the annual}} Howard Hughes Medical Institute Scientific Meeting held on November 13, 2006 in Ashburn, Virginia, Dr. Mello recounted {{the phone call}} that he {{received}} announcing that he had won the prize. He recalls that it was shortly after 4:30 am and he had just finished checking on his daughter, {{and returned to his}} bedroom. The phone rang (or rather the green light was blinking) and his wife told him not to answer, as it was a prank call. Upon questioning his wife, she revealed that it had rung while {{he was out of the}} room and someone was playing a bad joke on them by saying that he had won the Nobel prize. When he told her that they were actually announcing the Nobel prize winners on this very day, he said [...] "her jaw dropped." [...] He answered the phone, and the <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> told him to get dressed, and that in half an hour his life was about to change.|$|E
5000|$|When Mr. Gordon {{arrives at}} the house, he is {{accompanied}} by a police officer — the same officer in Joan's flashback. Upon entering the house, Mr. Gordon grasps his face in horror. In a flashback, Kat is seen answering the payphone and hears a gravely <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> which she calls [...] "Dad." [...] It tells her that her parents aren't coming, and to kill everyone. Later, Kat is seen stabbing the two chaperones to death. While one of the victims crawls along the floor, mortally wounded, Kat casually walks upstairs, returns with two pillowcases, then finishes the job. Rose goes to the bathroom and gets her period, sighing in relief. She hears someone enter the bathroom but then leave. When she goes to the dorm stairwell she sees two bloody heads wrapped in pillowcases and hurries back to the hall. Kat appears and stabs Rose to death before decapitating her.|$|E
