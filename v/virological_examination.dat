A reovirus was grown and the isolates reacted with polyclonal reovirus antiserum but did not react with monoclonal antibodies against chicken reovirus. Therefore the virus was considered a psittacine reovirus. Because reoviruses were seen consistently, they seemed to be the most likely cause. The climate, the introduction of new birds and the transportation of birds might be the factors involved in the disease in the Netherlands.

This study aimed to elucidate the prevalence of occult hepatitis B infection in Egyptian chronic HCV patients, and to clarify its role in non-response of those patients to pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy. This study enrolled 155 consecutive chronic HCV patients under pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy. All patients were exposed to clinical assessment, biochemical, histological and <b>virological</b> <b>examinations.</b> HBV parameters (HBV DNA, anti-HBc, anti-HBs) and patients' response status to the combination therapy were determined. Results In this study, occult hepatitis B infection occurs in 3. 9 % of Egyptian chronic HCV patients; tends to affect younger age patients, associated with higher base line HCV viral load, less hepatic fibrosis than monoinfected patients. This occult hepatitis B infection is not a statistically significant cause of non-response to pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy. Anti-HBs was not associated with any biochemical, histological or virological abnormalities in those patients, contrary to low response rate to therapy and higher HCV viral load that was observed with anti-HBc.

By electron microscopy (EM) a rotavirus was seen in 11 of the 14 fatty faeces and in only two of 11 specimens without visible fat. In a further study of pale or fatty faeces 20 such specimens sent for laboratory examination from patients not involved in the hospital outbreak were compared microbiologically with a similar number which were neither pale nor fatty.

A much more acute myxomatosis syndrome was produced in conventional rabbits than that reproduced previously in SPF animals. However, the main clinical signs were of the respiratory type. The MV strains MYX 254 / 95 and 801 appeared very virulent, killing all the inoculated animals.

In women who were HPV-negative and cytologically normal at recruitment, current smoking was not significantly associated with the risk of acquiring a cervical HPV infection, after controlling for life-time number of partners and age of oldest partner (HR= 1. 13, 95 % CI 0. 90 – 1. 41); nor did it prolong the length of time during which HPV could be detected (HR= 1. 03, 95 % CI 0. 78 – 1. 34). Current smoking intensity is an independent risk factor for high-grade CIN in young women, after controlling for cervical HPV infection...|$|E
40|$|Detection and {{investigation}} {{of all cases}} of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in children below 15 years of age are among the criteria for poliomyelitis-free certification. In the absence of poliomyelitis the incidence of AFP is around 1 per 100, 000 children aged < 15 years. In the Netherlands, surveillance of AFP began in October 1992 {{under the supervision of}} the Dutch Paediatric Surveillance System (NSCK). Over 90 % of clinically active paediatricians participated in the monthly reporting of new cases of AFP. From October 1992 to December 1994 (27 months), 52 cases of AFP were reported. The incidence was 0. 7 per 100, 000 over the period, and reported cases were evenly distributed throughout the country. The main cause of AFP was Guillain-Barré syndrome. The average time between onset of symptoms and visiting a doctor was less than 3 days. The median reporting delay was 29 days, although the system was not intended as surveillance for action. <b>Virological</b> <b>examination</b> of faeces was carried out for only 40. 4 % of AFP patients. The start of the NSCK surveillance system coincided with the 1992 - 93 outbreak of poliomyelitis in the Netherlands, but only 7 of the 18 children with paralytic poliomyelitis were reported through the AFP surveillance system. For certification purposes, the present AFP surveillance system in the Netherlands needs to be improved with respect to coverage by including neurologists, rapidity of reporting, and completeness of laboratory investigations...|$|E
40|$|Repeated {{measurements}} of smoking, cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) status and sexual behaviour {{were used to}} measure the risk of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in relation to changes in smoking and cervical HPV status, and to explore the impact of smoking on the acquisition and duration of incident cervical HPV infection. Included in this longitudinal analysis are 1485 women aged 15 – 19 years: 1075 were HPV-negative and cytologically normal at recruitment; 410 were HPV-positive, cytologically abnormal or both, at this time.

40|$|Background: Adverse {{course of}} HIV infection, rapid {{development}} of immunosuppression, severe opportunistic infections and malignant tumors and high mortality substantiate {{the importance of}} timely prescription of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART). The initial therapy pattern must remain efficient and safe in the long term. Objective: Our aim was to study effectiveness and safety of different patterns of initial HAART in HIV-infected children. Methods: The randomized controlled trial involved HIV-infected children aged 1 – 3 years. Clinical, immunological and <b>virological</b> <b>examinations</b> were conducted before and 12 months after HAART. The initial therapy pattern included 2 nucleoside HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors — zidovudine and lamivudine. Children were randomized to the groups differing in the third therapy component: lopinavir/ritonavir or nevirapine. Results: 25 patients were randomized to the lopinavir/ritonavir group, 23 children — to the nevirapine group. After 12 months of treatment, HIV replication suppression (blood viral load < 50 copies/ml) was achieved in 25 (100 %) lopinavir/ritonavir group patients and in 16 (70 %) nevirapine group patients (p = 0. 003). HIV infection did not progress clinically regardless of the pattern. The median number of CD 4 +CD 3 + lymphocytes in the lopinavir/ritonavir group increased from 20. 5 % (12; 23) to 30 % (27; 34) (p < 0, 001), in the nevirapine group — from 21. 5 % (17; 23) to 29 % (27; 38) (p < 0. 001). Adverse events developed in 13 (27 %) children. 3 and 2 children in the lopinavir/ritonavir group suffered from nausea and emesis, respectively. 1 and 1 patient in the nevirapine group suffered from allergic rash and drug-induced hepatitis, respectively. Conclusion: High effectiveness and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir allow recommending this drug as the third component of the initial HAART pattern for HIV-infected children. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarIn {{the season}} 1992 / 93 the {{clinical}} influenza surveillance among general practioners {{participating in the}} NIVEL (Netherlands institute of primary health care) system was supplemented by RIVM with <b>virological</b> laboratory <b>examinations.</b> Respiratory samples were taken from 388 patients with respiratory symptoms suggestive of influenza. From 127 specimens (33 %) a virus was isolated, which was influenza virus (mainly type B) in 87 cases. Compared with virological surveillance based on virus isolations from hospital admitted patients this new influenza surveillance system proved a better early warning system. The first influenza B virus strain of the season 1992 / 93 isolated in the Netherlands was isolated in this system about six weeks {{before the start of}} the epidemic. It was also more efficient: it yielded 43 % of all influenza virus strains of the season 1992 / 93 isolated in the Netherlands. The period showing many clinical cases of influenza-like illness coincided with that in which many influenza viruses were isolated...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{research}} — {{to estimate the}} efficacy of complex antiviral and immunotropic therapy of chronic Epstein-Barr viral infection (EBVI) in children with hematuric form of chronic glomerulonephritis (HFCGN). 54 children with HFCGN and chronic EBVI aged 3 – 17 years were examined. Patients received preparation of recombinant interferon (IFN) α- 2 β (viferon®) and a medication containing flavonoids Deschampsia caespitosa L. and Calamagrostis epigeios L. (proteflazidum®), at presence of chronic EBVI activity signs patients were also administered with acyclovir. Clinical manifestations, the data of nephrological, <b>virological,</b> immunological <b>examinations</b> were estimated before treatment and in 3 months after completion of treatment. During treatment the chronic EBVI activity signs were eliminated in a half of patients. The reduction of respiratory morbidity rate, asthenic syndrome, low-grade pyrexia, systemic lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, intestinal syndrome, lymphocytosis and the liquidation of splenomegaly were noted. The positive dynamics of HFCGN symptoms appeared as the reduction of macrohematuria relapses, intensity of hematuria, tubular disorders. The improvement of cytokine status indexes was observed — the increase of IFN-α and IFN-γ levels and the reduction of proinflammatory cytokine levels (IL- 1 β and IL- 6) ...|$|R
