Voit provided much of the underwater gear in exchange for product placement and film tie-in merchandise. Lamar Boren, an underwater photographer, was hired to shoot all of the sequences. United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Charles Russhon, who had already established Eon productions' rapports with the local authorities in Turkey for From Russia with Love (1963) and at Fort Knox for Goldfinger (1964), supplied the experimental rocket fuel used to destroy the Disco <b>Volante.</b> Russhon, using his position, was also able {{to gain access to the}} United States Navy's Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, used to lift Bond and Domino from the water at the end of the film.

[...] He found the song just okay, and noted that Nina made it work, when she delivered the song in her soft, mellifluous way, making the birthday song a distinctively Filipino tune. However, he questioned {{the presence of the}} song on her self-titled album, stating [...] "What’s this industry practice of throwing in the artist’s TV ad jingles? I don’t get it". Rito Asilo of Inquirer Entertainment described the song as [...] "noteworthy" [...] together with other Nina (the album) songs, including Eric Cabahug’s “Is It Over” and Nyoy <b>Volante’s</b> “I Need Your Love.” ...|$|R

She added that in 2007, the couple borrowed ₱1.4 million from her. The following year, Oliver issued several checks as payment for their debt. Some of the checks, however, bounced, she said. She further stated that in July 2008, she entered into a compromise agreement with the couple under which Evangeline immediately paid her ₱300,000 in cash. The couple also agreed {{to settle the balance}} of ₱1.1 million in monthly installments—from August 20, 2008 to February 20, 2010.

Nina said that although she was able to cash some of the checks, some—which totaled ₱550,000—were not honored due to insufficient funds.|$|R

5|$|Within the College of Cardinals a {{faction of}} {{cardinals}} {{that was not}} loyal {{to any of the}} Catholic monarchies had developed and were called the Squadrone <b>Volante</b> had risen during the conclave of 1655. The name, which translates as Flying Squadron, was given because of their support of candidates who they believed had {{the best interest of the}} papacy in mind rather than candidates supported by the secular monarch. Christina, Queen of Sweden, who had abdicated the Swedish throne and moved to Rome before converting to the Catholic Church, served as the secular supporter of the group, and became particularly close to Decio Azzolino.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Guánica {{was a small}} barrio {{within the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the town of Yauco. It had 60 houses in all and its only defense was eleven members of the 4th <b>Volante</b> de Yauco, a Puerto Rican militia unit, under the command of Lieutenant Enrique Méndez López. When the Guánica lighthouse keeper Robustiano Rivera spotted the approaching convoy, he immediately gave the alert to the residents of the barrio. All of the residents, with the exception Agustín Barrenechea, Vicente Ferrer, Juan María Morciglio, Simón Mejil, Salvador Muñoz, Cornelio Serrano and Pascual Elena who welcomed the invaders, abandoned their homes and joined Rivera on his journey to Yauco where he broke the news of the invading forces to the city's mayor.|$|E
5|$|The British squadron, {{of which}} Levant was part, was tasked with disrupting French trade through the Caribbean and hunting privateers. However the frigate saw little action {{in her first}} six months in the region; French trade had {{virtually}} ceased since the outbreak of war with Britain, while a smallpox outbreak killed some among Levants crew. It was not until early 1760 that Levant defeated her first opponent, a 14-gun French privateer which was sunk {{with the loss of}} 120 of her crew. Thereafter combat was more frequent. Two small privateers were captured in early 1760 – the 8-gun Poissan <b>Volante</b> and the 12-gun St Pierre – and these vessels and their crews were delivered into British custody on the Leeward Islands. In June Pickering, a British merchantman previously captured by the French, was retaken and sailed to Antigua as Levants prize. A further victory followed on 29 June with the capture of French privateer Le Scipio, after which Levant was put into harbour in Antigua for resupply. One contemporary source at this time records her as carrying only 20 of her 28 guns. She returned to sea {{before the end of the}} year, capturing the privateer L'Union on 18 December.|$|E

25|$|Aston Martin needed {{funds to}} survive in the long term. In May 1987, Gauntlett and Prince Michael of Kent were staying at the home of Contessa Maggi, the wife of the founder of the {{original}} Mille Miglia, while watching the revival event. Another house guest was Walter Hayes, vice-president of Ford of Europe. Despite problems over the previous acquisition of AC Cars, Hayes saw the potential of the brand and the discussion resulted in Ford taking a share holding in September 1987. In 1988, having produced some 5,000 cars in 20 years, a revived economy and successful sales of limited edition Vantage, and 52 <b>Volante</b> Zagato coupes at £86,000 each; Aston Martin finally retired the ancient V8 and introduced the Virage range—the first new Aston launched in 20 years.|$|E

500|$|The Aston Martin DB9 <b>Volante</b> is the {{convertible}} {{version of the}} DB9 coupe. The chassis, though stiffer, uses the same base VH platform. To protect occupants from rollovers, the <b>Volante</b> has strengthened the windshield pillars and added two pop-up hoops behind the rear seats. The hoops cannot be disabled and will break the car's rear window if deployed. In an effort to improve the Volante's ride while cruising, Aston Martin have softened the springs and lightened the anti-roll bars in the <b>Volante,</b> leading to a gentler suspension. The retractable roof of the <b>Volante</b> is made of folding fabric and takes 17 seconds to be put up or down. The <b>Volante</b> weighs [...] more than the coupe.|$|E

500|$|Bond's {{examination}} of the hull of Disco <b>Volante</b> {{was inspired by the}} ill-fated mission undertaken on 19 April 1956 by the ex-Royal Navy frogman [...] "Buster" [...] Crabb on behalf of MI6, as he examined the hull of the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze that had brought Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin on a diplomatic mission to Britain. Crabb disappeared in Portsmouth Harbour and was never seen again. As well as having Buster Crabb in mind, Fleming would also recall the information about the 10th Light Flotilla, an elite unit of Italian navy frogmen who used wrecked ships in Gibraltar to launch attacks on Allied shipping. The specifications for Disco <b>Volante</b> herself had been obtained by Fleming from the Italian ship designer, Leopold Rodriguez.|$|E
