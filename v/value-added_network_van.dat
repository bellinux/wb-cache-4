50|$|Prior to the {{emergence}} of cloud computing, integration could be categorized as either internal or business to business (B2B). Internal integration requirements were serviced through an on-premises middleware platform and typically utilized a service bus to manage exchange of data between systems. B2B integration was serviced through EDI gateways or <b>value-added</b> <b>network</b> (<b>VAN).</b> The advent of SaaS applications created a new kind of demand which was met through cloud-based integration. Since their emergence, many such services have also developed the capability to integrate legacy or on-premises applications, as well as function as EDI gateways.|$|E
50|$|Merchant data {{transmitted}} via a <b>value-added</b> <b>network</b> (<b>VAN)</b> was generally formatted as {{electronic data interchange}} (EDI). Online businesses found EDI was too cumbersome to accommodate all the file formats and business rules the growing volume of e-commerce retailers required. CommerceHub developed a web-based approach to serve e-commerce integration needs with their Universal Connection Hub, a translation engine that provides integration to translate and normalize supply chain communications, and enable electronic processing of purchase orders, change orders, and remittance confirmations in native file format. The Universal Connection Hub supports industry communications and file format options including web browser, VPN, VAN, FTP, web services, HTTPS, EDI, XML, flat files, spreadsheets, and others.|$|E

40|$|AbstractManufacturers {{of capital}} goods {{are subject to}} high {{requirements}} regarding availability and productivity. Services give manufacturers the opportunity to expand technical products and to fulfill all customer requirements. Solution concepts that consist of a union of technical products and services are called Product-Service Systems (PSS). For the realization of PSS, the capital goods manufacturer (PSS-provider) must collaborate with each participant of his extended <b>value-added</b> <b>network.</b> The extended <b>value-added</b> <b>network</b> consists {{of members of the}} development, production and service. This cooperation and complete interconnection with each participant provides the foundation of the development and offer of availability-oriented business models. This paper presents an approach for PSS which enables innovative services for the extended <b>value-added</b> <b>network</b> and for the customers in order to realize customized, availability-oriented business models. The approach is based on three sub-goals. First, development of PSS and customized, availability-oriented business models. This goal is presented in the paper. Second, development of smart components for collecting and processing of service relevant data. Third, design and configuration of an information management platform to provide and exchange service relevant data...|$|R

40|$|Part 3 : Collaboration FrameworksInternational audienceIn Germany, the {{importance}} of renewable energy resources increased significantly within the last years. In contrast to conventional power plants, there are highly interactive and complex <b>value-added</b> <b>networks</b> around such an energy resource. Today, the members of these networks mainly {{have to cope with}} information gaps or other issues regarding documentation quality. These challenges become critical in the context of knowledge intensive business-to-business processes. To encourage better business collaboration, a holistic knowledge-centered approach is needed. The digital Plant Lifecycle Record (PLR) addresses the given challenges in the context of wind turbines. Based on this approach, the members of the <b>value-added</b> <b>networks</b> cooperatively manage a plant-related knowledge base. By means of a use case, the general concepts of the Plant Lifecycle Record are introduced. Furthermore, empirically collected expectations of the most important stakeholders are discussed...|$|R

50|$|On a {{multinational}} scale, {{and due to}} the heterogeneous telecommunication economy and infrastructure before the market penetration of the Internet, management of a <b>value-added</b> <b>network</b> service proved a complicated task leading {{to the idea of}} user-defined networks, a concept preceding the nowadays ubiquitous availability of internet service. Standardization efforts for data networking were made by ITU-T (formerly CCIT) and included X.25 packet-switched networks and X.400 message handling systems, specifically motivated by an emerging transatlantic competition in the early 1990s.|$|R

In this context, the role of channel intermediaries and <b>value-added</b> <b>networks</b> is an increasingly important area of focus. This special section of the International Journal of Electronic Commerce on B 2 B e-commerce intermediaries and networks evolved from papers that were initially presented in the “Internet and Digital Economy Track” of the Thirty-second Annual Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences (HICSS- 32), held in January 1999. Three articles were selected that related to this theme, and each of them was extensively revised and improved by its authors, based on comments by the reviewers and the editors of the special section, during a nine-month review process. The resulting articles are focused on the challenges and opportunities associated with new forms of channel intermediaries and networks that enable new business process and interorganizational relationships to evolve using Internet and <b>value-added</b> <b>networks.</b> They represent research perspectives that span the globe...|$|R

The problem addressed in this study was (a) to identify the tasks required of an electronic data interchange (EDI) coordinator or an employee serving in that role who coordinates and manages the implementation of an EDI system, (b) to assess the relative task importance and frequency of performance within two EDI-user categories (hub and nonhub) and two EDI communication networks (direct point-to-point and <b>value-added</b> <b>networks),</b> (c) to develop an organizational and educational profile of the personnel who serve in performing the identified coordinator tasks, and (d) to identify possible groupings of tasks (factors) based upon the EDI coordinators' responses to the relative importance of each task. A descriptive survey was conducted with 834 members of the Data Interchange Standards Association, Inc. The individuals who performed the tasks of coordinating and managing EDI systems were requested to answer nine demographic/status questions and to judge the relative importance and frequency of performance of each of the identified 45 EDI coordinator tasks on a 5 -point Likert scale within their respective EDI-user category and communication network. A general conclusion was that all the 45 EDI coordinator tasks were performed by the majority of the respondents, regardless of the EDI-user category of hub and nonhub or communication method of direct point-to-point and <b>value-added</b> <b>network.</b> Those tasks not performed by an EDI coordinator or an employee in the information systems department were performed by either the marketing/sales or legal departments of an organization. Finally, the EDI-user category (hub, nonhub) and the communication environment (direct point-to-point, <b>value-added</b> <b>network)</b> do not significantly impact the importance of the tasks needed to be performed by the individual profiled for the role of EDI coordinator. Both organization and communication environments required similar responsibilities of an individual for the role of EDI coordinator...|$|R

40|$|In {{relation}} to its growth {{in size and}} user population, the Internet faces new challenges that have triggered the proposals of <b>value-added</b> <b>network</b> services, e. g., IP multicast, IP traceback, DiffServ, IntServ, etc. In addition, recent advances in processor and hardware techniques have enabled the production of high speed and powerful routers. Therefore, {{it is not unreasonable}} to expect the Internet to provide a variety of <b>value-added</b> <b>network</b> services other than packet forwarding in the near future. Depending on their purposes, value-added services may improve the scalability and efficiency of end user applications or may enhance the reliability and security of the network infrastructure. On the other hand, they may incur non-trivial overhead on the routers providing these services. It is a thorny problem to reach a balance between the performance of value-added services and the incurred overhead. In this paper, we study this problem in the context of both reliable multicast and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) defense. In either scenario, a software agent is activated at some routers in a tree topology to provide the required functionality. We formulate the problem as load-balanced agent activation problem (LBAAP). Our goal is to develop a mechanism to activate value-added service agents in the network for the purpose of reaching a balance between the performance and overhead. We develop a polynomial time algorithm to solve the LBAAP problem in single tree case, and propose a heuristic for the LBAAP problem in the case where multiple trees exist in the network, a problem we conjecture is NP-hard. Finally we evaluate the performances of various approaches for activating value-added service agents through simulation...|$|R
