5|$|Founded in 1871 in London as the Royal Normal College and Academy for the Blind, {{the college}} {{had a number}} of homes before moving to its campus in Hereford; it was renamed the Royal National College for the Blind in the late 1970s. It has been a pioneer in the {{education}} of visually impaired people in Britain since the Victorian era, and, as of 2010, is the only college for <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>students</b> in the United Kingdom to have been awarded Beacon Status in recognition of its outstanding teaching and learning.|$|E
5|$|Study {{programmes}} at RNC {{are designed}} to prepare <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>students</b> for progression into further education, university or employment. The development of independent living and personal skills is also encouraged. The college is divided into several different areas of study. These include Leisure, Therapies and Sport (including courses and qualifications in massage, complementary therapies, and sport treatment and management); Music, Media, Performance and Art (including courses and qualifications in music technology, media and art); Information and Communication Technology (including courses and qualifications in office skills and the European Computer Driving Licence); Business, Administration and Customer Service; Secondary level qualifications– General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) and General Certificate of Education Advanced Level (A-Level) qualifications in subjects such as English, mathematics, French and psychology; and Braille reading. On top of academic and vocational study students are also taught to develop independence and mobility skills for day-to-day living. Topics covered here {{include the use of}} a white cane and becoming familiar with the surrounding environment, using public transport safely and confidently, cooking and laundry skills, and using cash machines or making Chip and PIN credit card transactions.|$|E
5|$|RNC is {{the home}} of the first {{football}} academy for visually impaired players. The Football Academy was officially opened in August 2008 by former England footballer Sir Trevor Brooking and offers <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>students</b> the opportunity to include football as part of their study programme with a view to playing the game at a national level. The college {{is the home}} of the England blind football team, which is supported by the Football Association and coached by former professional footballer Tony Larkin. The game is played as a five-a-side match using a ball filled with ballbearings to enable players to hear its position. Teams consist of four blind players and a sighted goalkeeper who offers directions along with the coach and a sighted guide behind the opposition goalpost. RNC is helping to develop a national blind football league. In 2010 RNC hosted the World Blind Football Championship at its campus. The tournament got under way on Saturday 14 August with the opening match between England and Spain, and was won by Brazil following a 2–0 win against Spain in the final on 22 August. Members of England's blind football team travelled to Los Angeles in November 2011 to promote the sport in the United States, and took part in a day's training with former England captain David Beckham. The trip was organised by supermarket chain Sainsbury's as part of their sponsorship deal with the footballer.|$|E

25|$|Its {{reputation}} as a leading school for educating <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>students</b> was established by its then headmaster, George Marshall. The concept of Exhall Grange had originally been his, {{and he was one}} of its founding members of staff. After a brief spell as deputy head, he became head in 1953. Marshall would later achieve international recognition for his expertise on the education and welfare of those with sight loss, and received the OBE in 1976. Also in 1976 the school celebrated its Silver Jubilee. In 1999 former students from the school paid for a plaque to be dedicated to him at Exhall Grange.|$|E
25|$|In 1985 Exhall Grange was {{the largest}} school for <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>students</b> in the United Kingdom, but in more recent years, {{a greater number of}} {{children}} with single disabilities have gradually been included in mainstream education, and Exhall Grange's role as a special school has adapted as a consequence. Many of its students now have multiple disabilities, while the residential facilities were phased out over the 1990s and 2000s. The school now caters largely for pupils living in the local vicinity, with the main catchment area being the northern part of Warwickshire, including Bedworth and Nuneaton. Although it has a Coventry postal address, it is under the control of Warwickshire Education Authority.|$|E

40|$|This article aims to {{show how}} the process of new service technology-based {{development}} improves the current study support service for <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> university <b>students.</b> Numerous studies have contributed to improving assisted aid technology such as screen readers, the development and the use of audiobooks, and technology that supports individual learning by the <b>visually</b> <b>impaired.</b> Before conducting research on how the existing technologies could enhance today’s study support service, a lead user was identified from among the <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> university <b>students</b> that were involved in the new service development process. Telephone interview analysis was used for primary data collection from 49 sampled students while interviews, discussions, and brain storming were used for the primary data collection in the idea generation process and the new service functionality synthesis between the lead user and researcher. The findings from this study make several contributions to the area of service development using the lead user technique. The lead user provided an idea that is claimed to be a useful service solution.

25|$|Although blind {{students}} {{have benefited from}} talking calculators, the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades, both in public schools and state schools for the blind. The abacus teaches mathematical skills {{that can never be}} replaced with talking calculators and is an important learning tool for blind students. Blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a braille-writer and Nemeth code (a type of braille code for mathematics) but large multiplication and long division problems can be long and difficult. The abacus gives blind and <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>students</b> a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper. Many blind people find this number machine a very useful tool throughout life.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} the rationale, {{methods and results}} of an action research initiative which included Computer-mediated communication (CMC) in three university English Linguistics courses. In a crowded classroom situation where interactivity was limited and the learning environment largely defined by the lecturer, the introduction of an asynchronous dimension to teacher-student communication via an Internet infrastructure software brought an increase in teacher-student dialogue and a broadening of the learning environment. The successful use of CMC with a <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>student</b> is also recounted and future research with such students hinted at. The benefits of incorporating CMC in the courses are deduced partly from a quantitative analysis of student answers to a questionnaire, {{as well as from}} a qualitative analysis of the lecturer’s personal experience.

The software installed in GPS mobile phones {{used in this study}} had the following functions of (1) keeping and saving track of a mobile phone bearer so that the administrator at school and the parents could see that, (2) of sending mail to the administrator and the parents when the bearer was out of an designated area or when the bearer stayed at one location longer than a given time, and (3) of sending alarm mail from the bearer by simple operation. After using such GPS mobile phones for several days (5 to 26 days), 6 <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> (ages 12 to 41) were interviewed regarding usability and the feeling of security given by the mobile phone. According to the results, only two subjects answered they felt secured when they carried the mobile phones, while parents evaluated favorably the mobile phone function of informing locations on a real time basis. It was pointed out that mobile phone operation should be simple and battery should last for a long time. The software needs to improve, nevertheless, it is deemed that <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> students' carrying GPS mobile phones has value when assuring the safety of them when they go to and leave school...|$|R

Over time, the transcription and provision of alternative formats in Nigeria by libraries has not been based on users’ reading interest and information needs. This study delves into the reading interests and information needs of persons with visual impairment in Nigeria. Survey research design was adopted and the study purposively focused on southwestern Nigeria. Using stratified proportionate random sampling techniques, data was gathered by questionnaires namely the <b>Visually</b> <b>Impaired</b> Adult Questionnaire VIAQ (= 0. 75) and <b>Visually</b> <b>Impaired</b> <b>Student</b> Questionnaire VISQ (= 0. 78) from fourteen selected libraries stratified into non-governmental, public, tertiary institutions and secondary schools.

The study found that adults with visual impairment had high reading interests in religious, business, and entertainment materials, among others. Secondary school respondents had high reading interest in art subjects, reference materials, manuals and animal story materials. Both respondents showed high information needs in expected and relevant areas. Braille materials (58. 3 %) are the most preferred source of information generally.
