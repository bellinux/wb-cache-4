40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe use {{of shade}} guides {{to assess the}} color of natural teeth subjectively {{remains one of the}} most common means for dental shade assessment. Any {{variation}} in the color parameters of the different shade guides may lead to significant clinical implications. Particularly, since the communication between the clinic and the dental laboratory is based on using the shade guide designation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the consistency of the L∗a∗b∗ color parameters of a sample of a commonly used shade guide. Materials and methodsThe color parameters of a total of 100 VITAPAN Classical <b>Vacuum</b> shade <b>guide</b> (VITA Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany(were measured using a X-Rite ColorEye 7000 A Spectrophotometer (Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA). Each shade guide consists of 16 tabs with different designations. Each shade tab was measured five times and the average values were calculated. ResultsThe ΔE between the average L∗a∗b∗ value for each shade tab and the average of the 100 shade tabs of the same designation was calculated. Using the Student t-test analysis, no significant differences were found among the measured sample. ConclusionThere is a high consistency level in terms of color parameters of the measured VITAPAN Classical <b>Vacuum</b> shade <b>guide</b> sample tested...|$|R
40|$|Launch vehicle {{explicit}} guidance mechanism {{depends on}} the estimation of the desired burnout conditions and driving the vehicle to achieve these conditions. The accuracy of the vehicle at the target point depends on how tightly these conditions are achieved {{and what is the}} strategy used to define the trajectory. It has been observed inthe literature that most of the guidance mechanisms during reentry use vacuum guidance equations that is durin greentry the atmospheric effects are not considered. In order to achieve minimum miss distance at the target point theat mospheric effects are to be considered during the guided phase and appropriate corrections should be executed,otherwise depending on the reentry flight path angle and ballistic coefficient the errors can be as high as tens of nautical miles. In this paper, the authors develop a novel approach to these <b>vacuum</b> <b>guided</b> launch vehicle problems. The paper elaborates how to calculate a prior the reentry dispersion during the ascent phase guidance and provide guidance corrections such that the terminal conditions are achieved with higher accuracy.

40|$|By {{applying}} voltage pulses to {{the sample}} rod while recording the spectrum, we show, {{for the first}} time, {{that it is possible}} to obtain a time-resolved XPS spectrum in the millisecond range. The Si 2 p spectrum of a silicon sample containing a ca. 400 -nm oxide layer displays a time-dependent charging shift of ca. 1. 7 eV with respect to the Au 4 f peaks of a gold metal strip in contact with the sample. When gold is deposited as C 12 -thiol-capped nanoclusters onto the same sample, this time the Au 4 f peaks also display time-dependent charging behavior that is slightly different from that of the Si 2 p peak. This charging/discharging is related to emptying/filling of the hole traps in the oxide layer by the stray electrons within the <b>vacuum</b> system <b>guided</b> by the external voltage pulses applied to the sample rod, which can be used to extract important parameter(s) related to the dielectric properties of surface structures...|$|R

40|$|Digital image {{capturing}} {{and analysis}} techniques {{have been used}} to measure the colour of teeth and to compare with spectrophotometric results and visual observations. A non-linear image analysis approach was developed and, for the colour range of human teeth, allows device-dependant digital camera colour data to be quantitatively transformed to Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage (CIE) colorimetric values. With reference to a CIE standard illuminant, two different lighting arrays have been used. For flat and non-translucent white and yellow surfaces, spectrophotometric results showed that this transformation achieves required accuracy. It was found, in all of the present studies, which included measurements on the VITA Lumin® <b>Vacuum</b> shade <b>guide</b> and extracted teeth, that spectrophotometry invariably underestimated values of the CIE whiteness index. However, the results from these two types of measurement correlated well. There was also a reasonably good correlation between earlier data obtained by visual assessment and the present data by the two instrumental methods. For extracted teeth, both instrumental methods used in this work did not confirm a whitening effect for 2 -min brushing with toothpaste, but did show significant whitening results for bleaching with 15 % hydrogen peroxide.

At a deposition rate of 1 nm s- 1 films were deposited up to a thickness of 1 Mym. It will be shown that, using this controlled arc deposition characterized by plasma-sustained ion bombardment, DLC films can be prepared on silicon wafers, quartz, glass, ZnSe and NaCl or KCl substrates with an increased adhesion in comparison with earlier experiments. The frictional behaviour of films prepared at different temperatures (50 degree C- 500 degree C) was studied. The refractive index was estimated by ellipsometry and varied between 2. 0 and 2. 4 with an extinction coefficient below 0. 2 at a wavelength of 633 nm.

40|$|A {{portable}} {{high resolution}} soft x-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrometer {{has been developed}} for spectroscopic research at the Shanghai Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT) laboratory. A unique way of aligning the grazing incidence spectrometer using the zero order of the grating is introduced. This method is realized by extending {{the range of the}} movement of the CCD detector to cover the zero order. The alignment can be done in a few minutes, thus leading to a portable spectrometer. The high vacuum needed to be compatible with the EBITs is reached by mounting most of the translation and rotation stages outside the chamber. Only one high <b>vacuum</b> compatible linear <b>guide</b> is mounted inside the chamber. This is to ensure the convenient interchange of the gratings needed to enable wavelength coverage of the whole range of 10 to 500 angstrom. Spectra recorded with one of our low energy EBITs shows that a resolving power of above 800 can be achieved. In the slitless configuration used in this work, we found the resolving power to be limited by the width of the EBIT plasma. When mounted on the Shanghai EBIT which is a high energy EBIT and has a narrower EBIT plasma width, the estimated resolving power will be around 1400 at 221. 15 angstrom.

40|$|DIII-D`s ECH upgrade with 1 MW, 110 GHz gyrotrons is ongoing, {{and with}} it, an upgrade {{of the control}} system. The ECH Multiple Gyrotron Control System uses {{software}} distributed among networked computers, interfaced to a programmable logic controller (PLC), the timing and pulse system, power supplies, <b>vacuum</b> and wave <b>guide</b> controls, and instrumentation. During DIII-D operations, the system will allow a chief and a co-operator to control and monitor a number of gyrotrons from different manufacturers. The software, written using LabVIEW, allows for remote and multiple operator control. Thus any supported computer can become a control station and multiple projects can be simultaneously accommodated. Each operator can be given access to the controls of all gyrotrons or to a subset of controls. Status information is also remotely available. The use of a PLC simplifies the hardware and software design. It reduces interlock and control circuitry, includes monitoring for slow analog signals, and allows one software driver to efficiently interface {{to a number of}} systems. In addition, the interlock logic can be easily changed and control points can be forced as needed. The pulse system is designed around arbitrary function generators. Various modulation schemes can be accommodated, including real-time control of the modulation.

40|$|In modern {{manufacturing}} practices, it {{is desired}} {{that the final}} surface produced after many manufacturing operations should have good finish and surface characteristics. But {{in most of the}} cases, components produced after manufacturing operations does not have required surface finish and surface characteristics. So, manufacturers have to adopt different methods to obtain the desired surface finish and characteristics. Initially filing, lapping, honing and super finishing was the traditional methods to achieve good surface finish for simple parts. After that polishing and buffing was introduced. For finishing of internal holes and tubes, burnishing was introduced which has given very good results. There is another method called shot blasting or sand blasting which consists of attacking the surface of a material with one of many types of shots. To improve the surface characteristics, a process called shot peening was introduced which was the modification of shot blasting. Presently, it is required that some atomic energy parts, medical instruments and aerospace components need a very precise surface finish. Amongst them, <b>vacuum</b> tubes, wave <b>guides</b> etc. are difficult to finish by conventional finishing methods such as lapping, because of their shapes. For these types of applications where a very close control of surface finish and characteristics are required, a new finishing process called Magnetic Abrasive finishing has been developed. This paper presents recent developments in the field of magnetic abrasive finishing and describes the results obtained by various research scholars based on their experimentation in the field of magnetic abrasive finishing...|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{literature review}} of magnetic nozzle {{research has been}} performed, examining previous work, {{as well as a}} review of fundamental principles. This has allow us to catalog all basic physical mechanisms which we believe underlie the thrust generation process. Energy conversion mechanisms include the approximate conservation of the magnetic moment adiabatic invariant, generalized hall and thermoelectric acceleration, swirl acceleration, thermal energy transformation into directed kinetic energy, and Joule heating. Momentum transfer results from the interaction of the applied magnetic field with currents induced in the plasma plume., while plasma detachment mechanisms include resistive diffusion, recombination and charge exchange collisions, magnetic reconnection, loss of adiabaticity, inertial forces, current closure, and self-field detachment. We have performed a preliminary study of Hall effects on magnetic nozzle jets with weak guiding magnetic fields and weak expansions (p(sub jet) approx. = P(sub background)). The conclusion from this study is that the Hall effect creates an azimuthal rotation of the plasma jet and, more generally, creates helical structures in the induced current, velocity field, and magnetic fields. We have studied plasma jet expansion to near <b>vacuum</b> without a <b>guiding</b> magnetic field, and are presently including a guiding magnetic field using a resistive MHD solver. This research is progressing toward the implementation of a full generalized Ohm's law solver. In our paper, we will summarize the basic principle, as well as the literature survey and briefly review our previous results. Our most recent results at the time of submittal will also be included. Efforts are currently underway to construct an experiment at the University of Michigan Plasmadynamics and Electric Propulsion Laboratory (PEPL) to study magnetic nozzle physics for a RF-thruster. Our computational study will work directly with this experiment to validate the numerical model, in order to study magnetic nozzle physics and optimize magnetic nozzle design.

40|$|How the LHC works The LHC, the world’s {{largest and}} most {{powerful}} particle accelerator, is the latest addition to CERN’s accelerator complex. It mainly consists of a 27 km ring of superconducting magnets {{with a number of}} accelerating structures to boost the energy of the particles along the way. Inside the accelerator, two beams of particles travel at close to the speed of light with very high energies before colliding with one another. The beams travel in opposite directions in separate beam pipes – two tubes kept at ultrahigh <b>vacuum.</b> They are <b>guided</b> around the accelerator ring by a strong magnetic field, achieved using superconducting electromagnets. These are built from coils of special electric cable that operates in a superconducting state, efficiently conducting electricity without resistance or loss of energy. This requires chilling the magnets to about ‑ 271 °C – a temperature colder than outer space! For this reason, much of the accelerator is connected to a distribution system of liquid helium, which cools the magnets, as well as to other supply services. Thousands of magnets of different varieties and sizes are used to direct the beams around the accelerator. These include 1232 dipole magnets of 15 m length which are used to bend the beams, and 392 quadrupole magnets, each 5 – 7 m long, to focus the beams. Just prior to collision, another type of magnet is used to 'squeeze' the particles closer together to increase the chances of collisions. The particles are so tiny that the task of making them collide is akin to firing needles from two positions 10 km apart with such precision that they meet halfway! All the controls for the accelerator, its services and technical infrastructure are housed under one roof at the CERN Control Centre. From here, the beams inside the LHC will be made to collide at four locations around the accelerator ring, corresponding to the positions of the particle detectors...|$|R
40|$|Background: Aesthetics is an {{important}} aspect of modern day dentistry. Shade selection is one of the primary determinations for achieving good aesthetics in restorative dentistry. Shade selection has three parameters, namely value, chroma and hue. These can be determined by using either visual or instrumental shade guides. Previous publications have shown that teeth become darker with advancing age. 1 some studies suggest that tooth value and skin colour may be inversely related. People with medium to dark skin tones have lighter teeth; those with lighter skin tones have darker teeth. 2 However, other studies have found no correlation between skin tone and tooth shade. 3, 4 there are no studies relating tooth shade to tooth number;sex; skin tone; age and gingival pigmentation and smoking habits. Objectives: The objectives of this study were the following: ? To assess differences in tooth shade between the maxillary central incisor (11) and maxillary canine (13); between the mandibular central incisor (41) and the mandibular canine (43); between the maxillary central incisor (11) and mandibular central incisor (41) and between the maxillary canine (13) and the mandibular canine (43). ? To establish if there are any differences in the shades of teeth 11, 41, 13, and 43, and whether sex or age influenced the shade in any way. ? To determine if there is any correlation between the shades of teeth 11, 41, 13, 43 and patients skin tone, gingival pigmentation (non-pigmented, focal, diffuse) or smoking habits. Methods: The study sample comprised of 500 dental patients of which 305 were females and 195 were males. Their ages ranged from 18 to 81 years. These patients were divided into two age groups. Group one consisted of 291 patients, who were 35 years old and younger, Group two consisted of 209 patients older than 35 years of age. Their sex, skin tone (light, medium or dark), gingival pigmentation (non-pigmented, focal or diffuse) and smoking habits were recorded. The tooth shade of the middle third of the maxillary central incisor (11), maxillary canine (13), mandibular central incisor (41) and the mandibular canine (43), were taken, using the Vita Lumin <b>Vacuum</b> Shade <b>Guide,</b> Vita Linear 3 D-Master guide, as well as the spectrophotometer (Vita Easyshade Compact). Skin tone was recorded by using a specially designed skin tone guide; the skin tone of the inner aspect of the arm of the patient was recorded. The degree of gingival pigmentation was assessed by visual examination of the attached gingiva of the anterior part of the maxilla and mandible. Results: The results {{of this study indicate that}} the central incisors had a lighter value than the canines, but there was no difference in value between the maxillary central and mandibular central incisors. The maxillary canine was found to be darker than the mandibular canine. A statistically significant relationship was found between tooth value and the patient s age, sex and skin tone. There was no significant relationship between gingival pigmentation and tooth value for the maxillary central incisor 11. However, there were significant relationships between tooth values for teeth 13, 41, and 43 and gingival pigmentation. There was also no significant relationship between the tooth values for teeth 13 or 43 with smoking habits of the patients, although there was a significant relationship between teeth 11 and 41 with the patients smoking habits. Conclusion: The central incisor was lighter than the canine in both the mandible and the maxilla. The mandibular canine (43) was, however, lighter than the maxillary canine (13). There was a significant relationship between the age of patients and tooth value; older adults had darker and more yellow teeth than younger patients. Generally females had significantly lighter and less reddish teeth than males. There was a significant relationship between skin tone and tooth value in that lighter skin tone patients had darker teeth value while those with darker skin tone had lighter teeth value. Gingival pigmentation showed no association with the value of the maxillary central incisor (11), but was associated with lighter values for the maxillary canine (13), mandibular central incisor (41) and mandibular canine (43). Smoking darkened the incisor teeth, but had little or no effect on the value of canine teeth. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. ProsthodonticsMScUnrestricte...|$|R
