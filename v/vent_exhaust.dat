The vapor pressure, the quantity of the available lubricant, the temperature and the exhaust venting conductance passage are important considerations in the selection and application of a lubricant. In addition, the oil additives employed to provide certain properties of low friction, surface tension, antioxidant and load bearing characteristics, are also very important and need to be known with regard to their amounts and vapor pressures. This paper reports on the measurements and analyses carried out to obtain those parameters for two often employed lubricants, the Apiezon(TM) -C and the Krytox(TM) AB.

40|$|BackgroundCarbon {{monoxide}} (CO) is {{an important}} source of poisoning in children. We performed this study in order to clarify the clinical characteristics of pediatric patients with CO poisoning. MethodsWe identified and reviewed the medical records of pediatric patients diagnosed with CO intoxication and hospitalized in our department during a 10 -year period. Epidemiologic and clinical data were collected and analyzed. ResultsA total of 30 children with CO poisoning were identified. Their ages ranged from 2 to 17 years, with a mean of 9. 5 ± 4. 5 years. Improperly <b>vented</b> <b>exhaust</b> produced by gas hot water heaters was {{the most common cause of}} intoxication (53. 3 %), followed by house fires (26. 7 %). Intentional poisoning by charcoal burning by parents occurred in six patients (20. 0 %). The majority of events occurred during cool seasons (76. 7 %). The most common presenting symptom was consciousness disturbance (86. 7 %). Only one child died and the mortality was 0. 03 %. Five (16. 7 %) children developed delayed neurologic sequelae (DNS), but they all recovered completely within 2 months. Seizures during the acute stage, severe metabolic acidosis, significant hypotension, longer times for recovery to full consciousness, and longer hospital stays were observed in children with DNS. ConclusionChildren with CO poisoning had good outcomes in this series. Although improperly <b>vented</b> <b>exhaust</b> from water heaters and house fires were the most common causes, intentional poisoning by parents through charcoal burning was also an important factor.

40|$|Study of the {{unsteady}} {{burning of}} solid propellants can be best carried out under widely varying conditions and at relatively inexpensive cost {{in a simple}} test device known as the T-burner. This simple configuration is used to observe the spontaneous growth and decay of oscillations. Knowing the losses involved in the system, one can infer the frequency response of the burning surface within the approximations of linearity. A significant undertainty {{in the interpretation of}} data taken with T-burners arises because very little has been known about some of the acoustics, in particular the influence of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>vent.</b> The present investigation is a study of the influence of a subsonic <b>exhaust</b> <b>vent.</b> The primary apparatus is a resonance tube operated at room temperature with different resonance frequencies of the first longitudinal mode of oscillation.
