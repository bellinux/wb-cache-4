500|$|That {{was one of}} {{the first}} words I said to the entire team at ILM. I said, [...] "This movie needs to be theatrical, operatic, romantic." [...] We used a lot of words not usually {{associated}} with high-tech blockbusters … We went for a <b>very,</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> saturated color palette for the battle for Hong Kong. I kept asking John to tap into his inner Mexican and be able to saturate the greens and the purples and the pinks and the oranges. The classic Japanese woodblock print The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai was a common motif in the ocean battles; Del Toro recalled, [...] "I would say 'Give me a Hokusai wave'… we use the waves and weather in the movie very operatically." [...] The director asked that Knoll not necessarily match the lighting from shot to shot: [...] "It's pretty unorthodox to do that, but I think the results are really beautiful and very artistically free and powerful, not something you would associate with a big sci-fi action movie." [...] Del Toro considers the film's digital water its most exciting visual effect: [...] "The water dynamics in this movie are technically beautiful, but also artistically incredibly expressive. We agreed on making the water become almost another character. We would time the water very precisely. I'd say 'Get out of the wave [...]'" ...|$|E

You can't. I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone else, but it was <b>very,</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> educational for me and has informed my proclivities and politics ever since." [...] However, {{when asked about the}} quote in a 2015 interview to promote Avengers: Age of Ultron, he denied that his previous statement reflected any longstanding beliefs on his part, and stated, [...] "I wouldn't say that I'm a Republican or a liberal or a Democrat." ...|$|E

But yeah, last week we sat around and they played me some new stuff they're working on, and it sounds good.

500|$|Artists {{influenced}} by The Kinks include punk rock {{groups such as}} the Ramones, [...] The Clash, and The Jam, heavy metal acts including Van Halen and Britpop groups such as Oasis, Blur and Pulp. Craig Nicholls, singer and guitarist of The Vines, described the Kinks as [...] "great songwriters, so underrated". Pete Townshend, guitarist with the Kinks' contemporaries the Who, credited Ray Davies with inventing [...] "a new kind of poetry and a new kind of language for pop writing that influenced me from the <b>very,</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> beginning." [...] Jon Savage wrote that The Kinks were an influence on late-1960s American psychedelic rock groups [...] "like The Doors, Love and Jefferson Airplane". Music writers and other musicians have acknowledged the influence of the Kinks on the development of hard rock and heavy metal. Musicologist Joe Harrington stated: [...] "You Really Got Me', 'All Day and All of the Night' and 'I Need You' were predecessors of the whole three-chord genre ... the Kinks did a lot to help turn rock 'n' roll (Jerry Lee Lewis) into rock (Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Stooges)." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May credited the band with planting [...] "the seed which grew into riff-based music." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2007, Marshall {{stated that}} he was still [...] "open" [...] to the idea, and in April 2009, Zemeckis {{revealed}} he was still interested. According to a 2009 MTV News story, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were writing a new script for the project, and the animated characters would be in traditional 2D, while the rest would be in motion capture. However, in 2010, Zemeckis said that the sequel would remain hand-drawn animated and live-action sequences will be filmed, just like in the original film, but the lighting effects on the cartoon characters and some of the props that the toons handle will be done digitally. Also in 2010, Don Hahn, who was the film's original associate producer, confirmed the sequel's development in an interview with Empire. He stated, [...] "Yeah, I couldn't possibly comment. I deny completely, but yeah... if you're a fan, pretty soon you're going to be <b>very,</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> happy." [...] In 2010, Bob Hoskins stated he was interested in the project, reprising his role as Eddie Valiant. However, he retired from acting in 2012 after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease a year earlier, and died from those complications in 2014. Marshall has confirmed that the film is a prequel, similar to earlier drafts, and that the writing was almost complete. During an interview at the premiere of Flight, Zemeckis stated that the sequel was still possible, despite Hoskins' absence, and the script for the sequel was sent to Disney for approval from studio executives.|$|E

2500|$|This embittered letter {{remained}} a closely guarded secret, although a former high {{official of the}} CIA told me about it. Chris Nelson also reported it on April 16 in his widely respected, nonpartisan foreign policy newsletter: [...] "A certain Ms. Riza was even then Wolfowitz's true love. The problem for the CIA wasn't just {{that she was a}} foreign national, although that was and is today an issue for anyone interested in CIA employment. The problem was that Wolfowitz was married to someone else, and that someone was really angry about it, and she found a way to bring her complaint directly to the President. So when we, with our characteristic innocence, put Wolfowitz on our short-list for CIA, we were instantly told, by a <b>very,</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> senior Republican foreign policy operative, 'I don't think so.' [...] " [...] The Daily Mail of London also reported on his wife's letter when Wolfowitz was appointed president of the World Bank in 2005.|$|E

These strategies included expanding his contacts with Rossini to secure his growing friendship by continuing to see him on numerous occasions to seek his advice, noting [...] "I have always adored Rossini, and I succeeded, and happily... tamed Rossini's hatred, I no longer was frightened and finished that work of mine which won me so much honour". In a series of letters to Florimo throughoutthe year, he wrote of Rossini's increasing support, even love: [...] "I hear that he speaks well of me" [...] (4 September 1834); [...] "...if I have Rossini's protection, I'll be situated very well" [...] (4 November); [...] "The most beautiful is that Rossini loves me <b>very,</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> much" [...] (18 November); and [...] "...my very dear Rossini who now loves me as a son" [...] (21 January 1835, following the dress rehearsal).|$|E

2500|$|As Molyneux {{had been}} made a Vice President of Electronic Arts, his {{corporate}} role and responsibility increased considerably and he began making frequent trips to San Francisco. Over time, he grew increasingly frustrated with the position and wished to return to being a game developer. In July 1996, Molyneux decided to resign from Bullfrog to focus on game design, rather than become a mere employee. In response, Electronic Arts banned him from their offices, forcing him to move development of Dungeon Keeper to his house. Molyneux speculated that this was because they were scared {{that he would take}} people with him. He decided to leave as soon as Dungeon Keeper was finished, and commented: [...] "My last day will be the day that this game goes into final test. I'm <b>very,</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> sad, but also very relieved". He also said that Electric Arts were [...] "unbelievably patient", and thanked Vice President Mark Lewis for campaigning for Dungeon Keepers completion. Molyneux's planned departure was his motivation to make Dungeon Keeper good. He believed that he would enjoy being an executive, but said that it was [...] "an utter nightmare". Shortly after his departure, Molyneux said he still had feelings for Bullfrog, and wished them success. Despite his dissatisfaction with the corporate aspects of being a Vice President of Electronic Arts, Molyneux said that he had learned [...] "an enormous amount". In 2017, he revealed that his resignation was a result of his and technical director Tim Rance's drunkenness, and said he would take his resignation email back if he could.|$|E

When it finally came down to the wire at the <b>very,</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> last-minute—I'm talking about the 11 hours and 30 seconds mark—Axl had pulled out." [...] In the same interview, Slash mentioned the prospects of a reunion, stating [...] "It's not even something I like to dwell on. I don't even like to make comments because you end up with quotes that sometimes exacerbate the issue. I've got other things going on. I'm very, very proud—endlessly proud—of everything the band stood for and everything that's gone on with it." [...] Slash then stated in a July 2012 interview that [...] " [...] will 'never reunite'". In a later interview, former drummer Steven Adler stated that Matt Sorum would not take part in a potential reunion unless Adler was involved. Duff McKagan said in 2015, [...] " [...] could happen, and it could not. And I think it would be wonderful, one day, if we reconciled, first and foremost. That alone would be cool." ...|$|E

Shortly after arriving, she began taking vocal lessons with Brett Manning. Prior to forming Paramore, Williams and bassist Jeremy Davis, along with friend Kimee Read, {{took part in a}} funk cover band called The Factory, while Josh and Zac Farro had practiced together after school. The other members of what was soon to be Paramore had been [...] "edgy about the whole female thing" [...] of having Williams as vocalist, but, because they were good friends, she started writing for them. Williams said of the members when she first met them, [...] "They were the first people I met who were as passionate about music as I was." [...] The band was officially formed by Josh Farro (lead guitar/backing vocals), Zac Farro (drums), Davis (bass guitar) and Williams (lead vocals) in 2004, with the later addition of Williams' neighbor Jason Bynum (rhythm guitar). When Davis showed up, he was stunned to find out the drummer was only twelve years old. He admitted [...] "I had <b>very,</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very,</b> little faith in everyone in the band because of their age. I remember thinking, 'This {{is not going to work}} because this kid is way too young,' but that first day of practice was amazing. I knew we were on to something." [...] According to Williams, the name [...] "Paramore" [...] came from the maiden name of the mother of one of their first bass players.
