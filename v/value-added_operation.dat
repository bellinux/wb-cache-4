40|$|Refurbishing {{end of life}} {{electromechanical}} {{products is}} a <b>value-added</b> <b>operation</b> that provides both economic and environmental benefits. To maximize the benefits from refurbishing, decision making is critical, where the optimized time and the right component for manufacturing are determined. However, {{there has not been}} any satisfactory refurbishing decision-making strategy developed. In this paper, a prognostics and health management-based method is developed for refurbishment decision making. First, components are selected for in-situ monitoring using failure modes, mechanisms and effects analysis, then the remaining useful life for the system is estimated by analyzing the in-situ monitoring data so that the optimized refurbishing time can be determined. Finally, {{near the end of the}} system life, certain degraded components are selected via diagnosis, and refurbishment is carried out. The procedure of the method is evaluated by an analysis of the refurbishment of instruments in industrial process control. Using this method, the remaining useful life of electromechanical products can be optimally used, and the cost of refurbishment can be minimized...|$|E
40|$|Value-added {{agriculture}} {{has grown}} {{in recent years and}} is often promoted as a rural development or business survival strategy. For dairy operations, value-added often has meant adding a processing enterprise to an existing dairy farm. This case study examined whether it was profitable to transition to a <b>value-added</b> <b>operation,</b> comparing and contrasting the business characteristics and financial performance of three businesses of similar size in Vermont, Wisconsin, and New York. The methods included the development of income statements, balance sheets, and economic costs and returns in order to evaluate the profitability of the farming and processing enterprises for each business. The financial data were collected from a previous study done by Nicholson and Stephenson (2006) for the fiscal year 2003. Tabular summaries of the key information from these statements were constructed to facilitate comparisons of the farming and processing enterprises separately for the three businesses. Results indicated that similar size operations in terms of cow numbers can have highly different production and financial outcomes. For two of the three businesses, the processing enterprise was profitable based on net income, but only one business had a positive (and small) rate of return on assets (accounting for equity capital and operator labor costs). None of the three processing businesses were profitable when the full economic costs of milk production and processing were accounted for. It is also important to note that none of the three operations had positive net incomes for both the dairy and processing enterprises, which appears to question a basic premise underlying value-added businesses. Although this study will be beneficial for the business owners and others interested in value-added operations, a more in-depth and up-to-date study would be beneficial to determine the specific factors involved in a successful value-added enterprise...|$|E

30|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, the {{formation}} and success of Dakota Pasta Growers sparked a period referred to as “cooperative fever” (Harris et al. 1996; Cook and Iliopoulos 1999), {{which resulted in the}} formation of approximately 100 NGCs in the Upper Midwest. With the possible exception of Mountain States Lamb Growers, no similar trailblazer has emerged yet to demonstrate the economic viability of the LCA structure. Also, most NGCs formed in Minnesota and North Dakota, and Renville, MN, in particular became a hotbed of value-added activity (Patrie 1998; Burress et al. 2008). Although a clear cluster is absent, the fact Minnesota is also home to the most LCAs may imply its institutional environment is more conducive to collective action by individual farm producers than other states. Similarly, NGCs received financial support from various institutions, in particular the St. Paul Bank for Cooperatives and the North Dakota Agricultural Products Utilization Commission, to study the feasibility of <b>value-added</b> <b>operations</b> (Patrie 1998). Considering the possible involvement of private investors, similar support for LCAs is less likely to materialize.|$|R

40|$|For {{many years}} {{the concept of}} Lean Manufacturing has been applied in {{automotive}} development {{as a tool to}} refine the manufacturing practices to the greatest efficiency possible through waste reduction. Continuous Improvement is a quality innovation process that supports this objective, based on the manufacturing pillar – work processes and scientific experiments must be controlled and constantly modified and improved by the people who do, and are accountable for the work. Continuous Improvement implicitly implies the understanding and recognition of what is a problem and problem solving techniques used to formulate the best countermeasures to those problems. The process of Lean Manufacturing embraces a philosophy of excellence, elimination of waste on <b>value-added</b> <b>operations,</b> employee involvement, and continuous improvement. It is a journey, an on-going process that results in improved customer satisfaction and hence corporate profits. Profit is the reward for customer satisfaction. Increase customer satisfaction and your rewards are higher profits. This is the best method to maintain or increase market share. Understanding the basic hierarchy and philosophy of how to increase profits is essential to creating a sustainable lean enterprise. The following structures process outlines the basic questions and answers for any company to ask itself: Process to Sustained Success (chart). This thesis is about Ford Motor Company getting back to its roots, the heritage it started with the development of the moving assembly line and the original concept of Lean Manufacturing. This paper will focus on the creative steps outlined in the Process to Sustained Success procedure toward the journey of Lean Manufacturing. In addition, the current state of production processes, and recommended specific corrective actions for the re-innovation of Ford Motor Company to a sustained lean enterprise in a modern era will be discussed.

40|$|Since the {{inception}} of Pro-Fac Cooperative (PF) in 1960, the cooperative has undergone significant structural and organizational changes. The PF case presents {{a unique opportunity to}} examine the changes in the processed fruit and vegetable industry and the strategies adopted by a producer-owned cooperative to best represent member interests {{in the face of the}} industry structural changes over the past fifty years. PF is an agricultural cooperative that markets crops primarily grown by its member-growers, including fruits (cherries, apples, blueberries, and peaches), vegetables (snap beans, beets, peas, sweet corn, carrots, cabbage, squash, asparagus and potatoes), and popcorn. Members are located principally in the states of New York, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Washington, Oregon, Iowa, Nebraska, Florida, and Illinois. PF‟s history can be generally broken down into three distinct time periods, each representing a significant phase of restructuring. Particular attention is given to the decision to enter into the most recent and current phase of operations. Adequate financing of <b>operations</b> and <b>value-added</b> enterprises were dominant foci over all three periods and each phase involved a different approach. A variety of strategies were also used to enhance the market security for products produced by members. Initially, PF was formed to help preserve the fruit and vegetable processing industry in New York State. At that time, owning the processing facilities was a logical strategy. The development of alternative cooperative structures is often pursued to ameliorate financial constraints, while attempting to maintain member control. The evolution and restructuring of the PF cooperative can also be described using an ownership control rights typology framework (Chaddad and Cook 2004). Drawing from the property rights and incomplete contracts theories of the firm, Chaddad and Cook argue that alternative cooperative models differ in how ownership rights are defined and assigned to the agents of the firm, i. e., members, patrons, managers, and investors. In the current phase, investors acquired ownership rights in a separate legal entity that is partly owned by the cooperative, i. e. a cooperative with capital seeking entities (Chaddad and Cook 2004). As time progressed and economic conditions changed, PF members were not able to adequately capitalize <b>value-added</b> <b>operations.</b> An arrangement was struck with a private equity firm to provide a needed infusion of capital. The case examines to decision made by the board of directors to enter into this agreement. PF has increased its capacity to serve as a preferred supplier to those firms that can afford owning and operating plants while divesting its majority, ownership position in processing assets.

40|$|This project, {{funded by}} USDA Rural Development Office, {{provides}} baseline {{information on how}} member farmers of vegetable cooperatives in the Delta area of Arkansas can engage in a participatory entrepreneurial training to add value to their produce, better manage their farm business, and exploit market opportunities in order {{to contribute to the}} economic development of their communities. The main project objective was to establish a model of a successful value-added enterprise by nurturing business-development skills in value-added vegetable producers that can be shared and replicated for other agricultural enterprises. The project selected board of directors and member farmers of vegetable growers cooperatives in Lee, Phillips, and St. Francis counties and provided them with participatory entrepreneurial training on how to effectively diversify into sustainable low-cost value-added vegetable produce, secure vendor contracts from fresh vegetable wholesale and brokers, and manage their associations in profitable manner. The policy implication from the results of the training sessions indicates that given the adequate entrepreneurial training and managerial personnel, farm cooperatives and their member farmers in the area can effectively expand their <b>value-added</b> vegetable <b>operations</b> to exploit the growing vegetable markets in the mid-south in order to contribute to the economic development of their communities.

40|$|Recent {{events in}} the California dairy have left many dairy {{producers}} with high feed costs, low profits, and low (sometimes negative) margins. Some producers have transitioned to producing value-added or artisanal dairy products to help increase the revenues earned from farm milk, particularly in Sonoma County. Because limited research exists on the business opportunities {{in response to a}} rapidly growing market for value-added products, this project explores the feasibility of starting a gelato production and retail business in the Petaluma area. To assess business feasibility, a consumer survey was created to estimate the percent of residents and non-residents who would have an interest in purchasing locally-produced gelato, as one component of estimating potential retail sales. The initial investment and operating costs associated with starting a gelato scoop shop in Petaluma were also estimated using secondary data from retail space lessors and equipment suppliers and previous studies of <b>value-added</b> dairy <b>operations.</b> Many survey respondents have interest in purchasing a gelato product; 66 % and 64 % of residents and non-residents expressed at least a moderate interest, respectively. Based on this interest and their stated frequency of visits to other scoop shops, estimated monthly sales for a retail gelato shop ranged from 6, 454 to 21, 299 scoops. At an assumed $ 3. 50 /scoop based on stated consumer willingness to pay, this could generate estimated annual revenues between $ 271, 068 and $ 894, 558. Based on the estimated sales volumes, the variable cost per unit sold would be $ 0. 20, which would result in a gross margin of $ 3. 30 per unit sold. The estimated annual income over key operating expenses of ingredient costs per batch, packaging and materials, monthly rent, utility, repair and maintenance, and labor expenses could generate between $ 229, 178 and $ 484, 796, depending on the amount of units sold per visit. Thus, a gelato scoop shop could be a feasible and profitable business in the Petaluma area, and further detailed study and development of a business plan appears justified. The values for demand and operating expenses listed in this project are initial estimates and a refined analysis is appropriate {{as a part of a}} more comprehensive business plan...|$|R
40|$|Many {{companies}} {{strive to}} develop innovative products {{and create new}} solutions for their customers. However, in the rush for new products and innovations many companies forget to analyze the market {{to make sure that}} they understand it and can satisfy the needs. In order for a company to be effective, it is necessary that they focus on operations that create value for their customers. Many companies try to be market oriented, however some of them still fail to satisfy the market needs. Order-winner and qualifier theory is one way to analyze market needs and connect it to a company’s internal processes, so that resources can be allocated to those <b>value-added</b> processes and <b>operations.</b> Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to identify qualifier and order-winner characteristics within a market in order to match a new product with the markets needs. Two research questions were posed: (1) Which characteristics make a new product qualify within a market segment? (2) Which characteristics make a new product to an order-winner within a market segment? The thesis followed a procedure to analyze market needs and requirements of material and supplier characteristics. The thesis was conducted in the home-appliance market through two case studies: one of OBH Nordica, representing the low-mid-end zone: and the second of Electrolux, representing the mid-high-end zone. The findings of the study indicated that certain qualifier characteristics are common for the entire market, while others are specific for their zone. So for a company to be considered as a supplier in a specific zone or segment, they have to be able to fulfill both the market’s common characteristics as well as the characteristics that are specific for the zone they belong to. The study also showed that a company should constantly compare their order-losing sensitive qualifiers with their competitors, since a slight change in the environment can cause them to start losing orders.
