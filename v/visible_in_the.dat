5|$|Albrecht Goštautas (Olbracht Gasztołd), Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and voivode of Vilnius, {{is barely}} <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top {{right of the}} painting. His {{presence}} in the painting is intended to symbolize {{the wisdom of the}} king as a legislator.|$|E

5|$|Circinus X-1 is an X-ray {{binary star}} system that {{includes}} a neutron star. Observations of Circinus X-1 in July 2007 revealed the presence of X-ray jets normally found in black hole systems. Located at 19,000light-years, the pulsar PSR B1509-58, also called the Circinus Pulsar, has expelled a 20-light-year-long jet of material from its southern pole, clearly <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> X-ray spectrum. Another supernova remnant in Circinus is that of SN 185. Recorded by Chinese observers in 185 AD, SN 185 was <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night sky for around eight months; its remnants, known as RCW 86, cover an area larger than the typical full moon.|$|E

Scyther was later {{released}} as a <b>visible</b> figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Target-exclusive 3-figure booster pack.|$|R

5|$|Aarhus has {{developed}} in stages, from the Viking age to modern times, all <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city today. Many architectural styles {{are represented in}} different parts of the city such as Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, National Romantic, Nordic Classicism, Neoclassical, Empire and Functionalism. The city has grown up around the main transport hubs, the river, the harbour and later the railway station, and as a result, the oldest parts of the city are also the most central and busiest today.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{architectural}} historian John Harvey, the octagonal chapter house, built about 1332 by William Ramsey, was the earliest example of Perpendicular Gothic. This {{is confirmed by}} Alec Clifton-Taylor, who notes that the chapter house and St Stephen's chapel at Westminster Abbey predate the early Perpendicular work at Gloucester Cathedral by several years. The foundations of the chapter house were recently made <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> redeveloped south churchyard of the new cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{inbreeding}} <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> table above, four of the horses in the fourth generation (Narsullah, Hail To Reason, Nearctic and Nangela) are direct descendants of Nearco, who as a result appears twice in the fifth, and twice in the sixth generation of Fantastic Light's extended pedigree.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue is}} why France2, the Associated Press and Reuters did not film the scene {{directly}} after the shooting, including the {{shooting death of}} the ambulance driver who arrived to pick up Jamal and Muhammad. Abu Rahma's footage stops suddenly after the shooting of the father and son, then begins again—from the same position, with the white minibus behind which Abu Rhama was standing <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shot—with other people being loaded into an ambulance.|$|E
5|$|At {{least four}} cones, four stratovolcanoes, and three craters are <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lake. The Tandukbenua cone on the northwestern {{edge of the}} caldera has only sparse vegetation, {{suggesting}} a young age of several hundred years. Also, the Pusubukit (Hill Center) volcano (1971 metres above sea level) on the south edge of the caldera is solfatarically active.|$|E
5|$|Dunrobin's origins {{lie in the}} Middle Ages, {{but most}} of the present {{building}} and the gardens were added by Sir Charles Barry between 1835 and 1850. Some of the original building is <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interior courtyard, despite a number of expansions and alterations that made it the largest house in the north of Scotland. After being used as a boarding school for seven years, it is now open to the public.|$|E

5|$|Matejko {{depicted}} {{many important}} {{figures of the}} Polish Renaissance period including taking the liberty to include at least one who were not actually present at the event. In a similar vein, although the event portrayed took place in 1525, Matejko painted fragments of the Sukiennice in Renaissance style, a form that dates from the year 1555, after a fire which destroyed the building in its original Gothic style. St. Mary's Basilica is <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background.|$|E
5|$|Other Japanese characteristics, {{including}} the further use of traditional pentatonic scales, continued to crop up elsewhere {{in his early}} works. In the opening bars of Litany, for Michael Vyner (first movement), a reconstruction from memory by Takemitsu of Lento in Due Movimenti (1950; the original score was lost), pentatonicism is clearly <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper voice, which opens the work on an unaccompanied anacrusis. The pitches of the opening melody combine to form the constituent notes of the ascending form of the Japanese in scale.|$|E
5|$|Supernova SN 1054 {{was another}} widely {{observed}} event, with Arab, Chinese, and Japanese astronomers recording the star's appearance in 1054 CE. It {{may also have}} been recorded by the Anasazi as a petroglyph. This explosion appeared in the constellation of Taurus, where it produced the Crab Nebula remnant. At its peak, the luminosity of SN 1054 may have been four times as bright as Venus, and it remained visible in daylight for 23 days and was <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night sky for 653 days.|$|E

5|$|The World Before the Flood is {{strongly}} influenced by A Bacchanalian Revel Before a Term of Pan (1632–33) by Nicolas Poussin, whom Etty greatly admired and of whose works he had previously made several copies; this painting had been bought by the National Gallery in 1826. Adam and Michael are not <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> painting. Instead, the viewer sees the scene from Adam's point of view.|$|E
5|$|The {{east and}} west wings of the {{building}} once each contained a transit room. Each of the rooms had a mounted transit telescope on a brick pier; the piers are still <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basement below the transit rooms. The western transit rooms were converted into office space by the 1920s. The eastern transit rooms were converted to office space more recently.|$|E
5|$|The game {{uses the}} visual effect of {{applying}} pre-rendered video footage to a polygon, specifically the game's pre-recorded {{shows on the}} television. IGN writer Anoop Gantayat praised this effect's implementation, although he did note some minor graphical issues <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transition from distanced to full-screen viewing. Also unusual for the Pokémon video game series, the Pokémon's voices are borrowed from the anime and sound like their names.|$|E
