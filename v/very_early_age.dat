5|$|Juveniles {{begin to}} court at a <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>age,</b> {{but may not}} bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key {{behaviors}} of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Anton Graf {{was born}} on 24 October 1912 in Engen {{in what was then}} the Grand Duchy of Baden near Lake Constance and the Swiss border, the son of Wilhelm Graf (1878–1937), a farmer, and his wife Maria, née Sailer (1877–1953). He was the third of three children, with two older brothers, Wilhelm Wilhelm (1904–1981) and Josef Wilhelm (1909–1981). His father fought in and survived World War I as an {{artillery}} soldier, being awarded the Iron Cross. Postwar, the Weimar Inflation crisis of 1923 wiped out virtually all the family savings, and as a result, from a <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>age,</b> Graf had to work.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{fracture}} mechanics of concrete structures is first reviewed. This clearly demonstrates that, despite the successful application of fracture mechanics to study {{the fracture}} behavior of mature concrete, its application to the cracking of very early-age concrete (i. e. within several hours after mixing) {{is still in its}} infancy, with very limited literature available. This is believed principally {{to be the result of}} difficulties that arise in the experimental determination of the properties of extremely fragile concrete at <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>ages.</b> In a recent research at the University of Queensland, a test apparatus and experimental procedures have been developed that enable the complete tensile stress-displacement behavior of concrete specimens at <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>ages</b> to be captured reliably. Based on the data obtained, the paper shows that current models for the stress-separation relationship of mature concrete may not apply for concrete at <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>ages.</b> Revised mathematical models for the stress-separation relationship of early-age concrete are proposed...|$|R

5|$|The {{theory of}} {{their use in}} sexual display was first {{proposed}} by Davitashvili in 1961 and has gained increasing acceptance since. Evidence that visual display was important, either in courtship or in other social behavior, {{can be seen in}} the fact that horned dinosaurs differ markedly in their adornments, making each species highly distinctive. Also, modern living creatures with such displays of horns and adornments use them in similar behavior. A 2006 study of the smallest Triceratops skull, ascertained to be a juvenile, shows the frill and horns developed at a <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>age,</b> predating sexual development and thus probably important for visual communication and species recognition in general. The use of the exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists for structures in modern species.|$|E

50|$|In most of Northwestern Europe, {{marriage}} at <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>ages</b> was rare. One thousand marriage certificates from 1619 to 1660 in the Archdiocese of Canterbury {{show that}} only one bride was 13 years old, four were 15, twelve were 16, and seventeen were 17 years old; while the other 966 brides were at least 19 years old. Additionally, the Church dictated that both {{the bride and groom}} must be at least 21 years of age to marry without the consent of their families; in the certificates, the most common age for the brides is 22 years. For the grooms 24 years was the most common age, with average ages of 24 years for the brides and 27 for the grooms. While European noblewomen often married early, they were a small minority of the population, and the marriage certificates from Canterbury Muddy Mullins show that even among nobility it was very rare to marry women off at <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>ages.</b>|$|R

40|$|Proper {{knowledge}} of tensile properties of concrete from <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>ages</b> {{is essential for}} effective control of not only early-age cracking but also of residual stress due to restrained early-age deformation {{as well as for}} demolding and handling of young concrete members in the precast industry. Despite significant past research, such knowledge is currently inadequate and based on experimental data with questionable reliability, due mainly to the considerable challenges in testing early-age concrete. This paper first highlights the challenge and importance of collecting reliable test data on full tensile stress-deformation curves for very early-age concrete. Through identifying and effectively addressing critical drawbacks in previous test setups, an improved direct tensile testing system that can reliably capture simultaneously stress and deformation of concrete from the age of several hours after mixing has been successfully developed. Key features of the improved setup, including the air-bearing box for friction minimisation and digital image correlation for non-contact full-field deformation capturing, are then reported in the paper. Based on the newly collected data, fundamental tensile properties of concrete at <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>ages</b> are re-assessed and presented. Such properties include tensile strength, Young’s modulus, strain at peak stress, fracture energy, performance under cyclic loading and tensile relaxation...|$|R

Clinically alopecia is observed on the temporal and vertex areas, during postpubertal period. Vellus like hairs are pathognomonic for the disease. The decrease in anagen/telogen ratio is detected in histopathological examination. The treatment consists of topical mioxidil, oral finasteride and commonly used surgical methods. ...|$|R
