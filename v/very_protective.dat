However, calves are {{occasionally}} left in nurseries which are guarded by {{one or a few}} adults. Calves in nurseries engage in playfights. Weaning starts between six and eight months after birth, and most calves are fully weaned after a year. Like many other large mammals, hippos are described as K-strategists, in this case typically producing just one large, well-developed infant every couple of years (rather than many small, poorly developed young several times per year as is common among small mammals such as rodents).|$|E

5|$|In 1964, {{she also}} played {{the lead role}} in The Magnificent Cuckold, based on the Belgian play Le Cocu magnifique. She was {{at the height of}} her sensuality at the time, but later the film only brought back {{unpleasant}} memories for her as she experienced little empathy with the producer Antonio Pietrangeli, while the male star Ugo Tognazzi tried to seduce her. In 1965, Cardinale appeared in Visconti's Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa, known as Sandra (Of a Thousand Delights) in the USA and Of These Thousand Pleasures in the UK, playing a Holocaust survivor who may have had an incestuous relationship with her brother. Later that year, she starred opposite Rock Hudson in Universal Pictures's Blindfold, the last film to be directed by Philip Dunne. Filming began on 22 February 1965 on location in Ocala, Florida. Diane Bond doubled for Cardinale in the film. Cardinale became good friends with Hudson, who proved to be <b>very</b> <b>protective</b> of her, knowing her discomfort outside of Italy. While in Hollywood, Cardinale also became friends with Barbra Streisand, Elliott Gould, and Steve McQueen, but she never managed to feel at home there.|$|E

The main inquisitor is a man named Angel, whose voice and manner disconcert Pinfold, who {{believes}} he detects a veiled malicious intent. In the weeks that follow, Pinfold broods on the incident.

Amid an increasingly bizarre series of overheard incidents, he hears remarks which become progressively more insulting, and then directly threatening towards himself. The main tormentors are a man and a woman, whose vicious words are balanced by those of an affectionate younger woman, Margaret. He is convinced that the man is the BBC interviewer Angel, using his technical knowledge to broadcast the voices. Pinfold spends sleepless nights, awaiting a threatened beating, a kidnapping attempt and a seductive visit from Margaret.|$|E
25|$|Once a bear claims {{an animal}} carcass, it becomes <b>very</b> <b>protective</b> of its kill.

Although wary of strangers, they can accept them when it is clear that no harm is meant, but is instinctively <b>very</b> <b>protective</b> of its family, home and possessions. The Komondor is very good with other family pets, often <b>very</b> <b>protective</b> over them, but is intolerant to trespassing animals and is not a good dog for an apartment. The dog is vigilant and will rest in the daytime, {{keeping an eye on the}} surroundings, but at night is constantly moving, patrolling the place, moving up and down around the whole area. The dogs usually knock down intruders and keep them down until the owner arrives.

TEM image shows the average size of AgNPs to be 11  nm. The specific surface area of adsorbent is 3.14  cm 2.|$|R
25|$|Orlov was <b>very</b> <b>protective</b> of his bloodstock, {{and would}} sell only geldings (castrated stallions). Even when Tsar Alexander I asked Orlov {{to sell him}} several stallions, Orlov only agreed to sell geldings. This rule was {{maintained}} for twenty years after Orlov's death.

25|$|Like their wild ancestors, {{domestic}} geese are <b>very</b> <b>protective</b> {{of their}} offspring {{and other members}} of the flock. The gander will normally place himself between any perceived threat and his family. Owing to their highly aggressive nature, loud call and sensitivity to unusual movements, geese can contribute towards the security of a property. In late 1950s South Vietnam, the VNAF used flocks of geese to guard their parked aircraft at night due to the noise they would make at intruders.|$|E
5000|$|This form of {{fighting}} takes place primarily between two practitioners who agree {{to enter into}} a no-holds-barred match, with the understanding that they will be [...] "friends {{at the end of the}} day", wearing <b>very</b> little <b>protective</b> gear and fighting with single or double sticks. Matches between opponents have been held using a variety of weapons including staff, bokken, whip, shock knife, aluminum practice knives, Nunchaku, mae sawks, chains and three-section staff. Impromptu, unorthodox weapons such as canes and garden hoses have been used as well.|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of a protective layer on OFHC copper specimens in hydro-alcoholic solutions of the following silanic agents (3 -mercapto-propyl-trimethoxy-silane, PropS-SH and n-octadecyl-trimethoxy-silane, OctadecS) was studied by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, Potentiodynamic Polarization Curve recording and FTIR spectroscopy. By simple immersion, the silane agents immediately physisorb on copper, but the protective effects are poor. In the case of PropS-SH it is necessary the process of curing, rather than aging, to form <b>very</b> high <b>protective</b> layers. In the case of OctadecS, curing or aging produce the same effects, which are {{lower than those of}} cured PropS-SH...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies on}} the {{relation}} between fruit and vegetable intake and chronic diseases show variable results. In many studies a small protective effect is found for fruit and vegetable intake and the risk for cardiovascular diseases and cancers. In other studies these effects {{could not be found}} in a statistically significant way. Experimental animal and mechanistic studies with cell lines or in humans show often clear protective effects of many phytochemicals like e. g. glucosinolates, flavonoids and carotenoids. In this paper the effect of variability in the food production chain on the results of epidemiological studies as predicted by probabilistic simulation studies is presented. Even if a <b>very</b> strong <b>protective</b> effect of a phytochemical is assumed, this variability will lead to only <b>very</b> small, non-significant, <b>protective</b> effects to be found in epidemiological studies. The effect of different scenarios to improve human health has been investigated. Increasing the fruit and vegetable consumption will produce far less benefits when compared with a scenario of increasing the level of phytochemicals and reducing the variability in its content...|$|R
25|$|Edward is {{described}} in the book as being charming, polite, determined, and very stubborn. He is <b>very</b> <b>protective</b> over Bella and puts her safety, humanity and welfare before anything else. He often over-analyzes situations and {{has a tendency to}} overreact, especially in situations where Bella's safety is at risk. He retains some outdated speech from his human life in the early 20th century. Edward sees himself as a monster, and after falling in love with Bella, he desperately wishes that he were human instead of a vampire.|$|E
25|$|On the outside, Victoria is a {{typically}} fragile lady of her era, frequently screaming {{when faced with}} the creatures the Doctor and his companions encounter in their travels, such as the Cybermen and the Yeti. However, this exterior hides an inner strength that crops up when needed. Victoria may be young, but she has an instinct for when she is being lied to, and her sensibility is a contrast to the recklessness of Jamie and the curiosity of the Doctor. Jamie, in particular, is <b>very</b> <b>protective</b> towards and fond of Victoria, and is heartbroken when she chooses to leave.|$|E
25|$|Leslie acts {{most often}} on instinct, like an animal. When birds and jets fly overhead, he runs {{to find an}} escape route. Leslie is <b>very</b> <b>protective</b> of Sarah. When Charlie hurts Sarah—asking her {{what she would do}} if Leslie left and never came back—Leslie attacks him. After hitting him, Leslie nearly chokes him until the females intercede.
