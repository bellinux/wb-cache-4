5|$|Pneumonia {{is due to}} infections caused {{primarily}} by bacteria or <b>viruses</b> <b>and</b> less commonly by fungi and parasites. Although {{there are more than}} 100 strains of infectious agents identified, only a few are responsible {{for the majority of the}} cases. Mixed infections with both <b>viruses</b> <b>and</b> bacteria may occur in up to 45% of infections in children and 15% of infections in adults. A causative agent may not be isolated in approximately half of cases despite careful testing.|$|E

5|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{action of}} iodine is quick and works at low concentrations, {{and thus it}} is used in operating theatres. Its specific mode of action is unknown. It penetrates into microorganisms and attacks particular amino acids (such as cysteine and methionine), nucleotides, and fatty acids, ultimately resulting in cell death. It also has an antiviral action, but nonlipid <b>viruses</b> <b>and</b> parvoviruses are less sensitive than lipid enveloped viruses. Iodine probably attacks surface proteins of enveloped <b>viruses,</b> <b>and</b> it may also destabilise membrane fatty acids by reacting with unsaturated carbon bonds.|$|E
5|$|Differentiating between {{infectious}} and non-infectious illness, {{and identifying}} the underlying etiology of infection, {{can be quite}} challenging. For example, {{more than half of}} cases of encephalitis remain undiagnosed, despite extensive testing using state-of-the-art clinical laboratory methods. Metagenomic sequencing shows promise as a sensitive and rapid method to diagnose infection by comparing genetic material found in a patient's sample to a database of thousands of bacteria, <b>viruses,</b> <b>and</b> other pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Kaspersky's {{interest}} in IT security began in 1989, when his PC was infected by the Cascade virus, {{while working for}} the Ministry of Defense. He studied how the virus worked and developed a program to remove it. Afterwards he continually found new <b>viruses</b> <b>and</b> developed software to remove them, as a hobby. Early on Kaspersky's anti-virus software had just 40 virus definitions and was distributed mostly to friends.|$|E

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} the relationship between viral activity and bacterial invasive disease, considering both influenza <b>virus</b> <b>and</b> respiratory syncytial <b>virus</b> (RSV). This study aimed to assess the potential relationship between invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), meningococcal disease (MD), <b>and</b> influenza <b>virus</b> <b>and</b> RSV activity in The Netherlands. Correlations were determined between population-based data on IPD and MD during 1997 - 2003 <b>and</b> influenza <b>virus</b> <b>and</b> RSV surveillance data. Incidence rate ratios of disease during periods of high influenza <b>Virus</b> <b>and</b> RSV activity over the peri-seasonal and summer baseline periods were calculated. The analyses comprised 7266 and 3072 cases of IPD and MD. When data from all seasons were included, the occurrence of pneumococcal bacteraemia and MD correlated significantly with influenza <b>virus</b> <b>and</b> RSV activity both in children and adults. Periods of increased influenza <b>virus</b> <b>and</b> RSV activity showed higher rates of pneumococcal bacteraemia in older children and adults than the peri-season period. Rates of MD in children were also higher during periods of increased influenza virus activity; the same appeared true for M D in older children during periods of increased RSV activity.

5|$|Researchers are {{concerned}} that trucking colonies {{around the country to}} pollinate crops, where they intermingle with other bees from all over, helps spread <b>viruses</b> <b>and</b> mites among colonies. Additionally, such continuous movement and re-settlement is considered by some a strain and disruption for the entire hive, possibly rendering it less resistant to all sorts of systemic disorder.|$|E

5|$|Although animals {{generally}} express fewer {{variants of}} the dicer enzyme than plants, RNAi in some animals produces an antiviral response. In both juvenile and adult Drosophila, RNA interference {{is important in}} antiviral innate immunity and is active against pathogens such as Drosophila X virus. A similar role in immunity may operate in C. elegans, as argonaute proteins are upregulated in response to <b>viruses</b> <b>and</b> worms that overexpress components of the RNAi pathway are resistant to viral infection.|$|E

5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of zoonotic pathogens, including rabies, histoplasmosis both directly and in guano, Nipah Hendra <b>viruses,</b> <b>and</b> possibly ebola virus. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more zoonotic viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. They seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to bats' immune systems. Furthermore, their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{mushrooms}} enjoy usage as therapeutics in folk medicines, such as Traditional Chinese medicine. Notable medicinal mushrooms with a well-documented {{history of}} use include Agaricus subrufescens, Ganoderma lucidum, and Ophiocordyceps sinensis. Research has identified compounds produced by {{these and other}} fungi that have inhibitory biological effects against <b>viruses</b> <b>and</b> cancer cells. Specific metabolites, such as polysaccharide-K, ergotamine, and β-lactam antibiotics, are routinely used in clinical medicine. The shiitake mushroom {{is a source of}} lentinan, a clinical drug approved for use in cancer treatments in several countries, including Japan. In Europe and Japan, polysaccharide-K (brand name Krestin), a chemical derived from Trametes versicolor, is an approved adjuvant for cancer therapy.|$|E
