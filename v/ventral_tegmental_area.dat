5|$|Research in {{the field}} of {{addiction}} medicine has also recently turned its focus to LTP, owing to the hypothesis that drug addiction represents a powerful form of learning and memory. Addiction is a complex neurobehavioral phenomenon involving various parts of the brain, such as the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> <b>area</b> (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Studies have demonstrated that VTA and NAc synapses are capable of undergoing LTP and that this LTP may be responsible for the behaviors that characterize addiction.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> <b>area</b> (VTA) {{is another}} {{midbrain}} area. The most prominent group of VTA dopaminergic neurons projects to the prefrontal cortex via the mesocortical pathway and another smaller group projects to the nucleus accumbens via the mesolimbic pathway. Together, these two pathways are collectively termed the mesocorticolimbic projection. The VTA also sends dopaminergic projections to the amygdala, cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. Mesocorticolimbic neurons {{play a central}} role in reward and other aspects of motivation.|$|E
5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> <b>area,</b> ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E
40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is classically {{thought of}} as a pro-totypic {{extrapyramidal}} motor disorder due to dopamine deficiency, resulting from catastrophic cell loss in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. Even within the dopamin-ergic system, however, this is an oversimplification, and other, more variable, cell loss occurs within the medial nigra, retrorubral, and <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> <b>areas.</b> Projections from these structures modulate cognitive and affective function. Dopamine replacement therapy for the motor symptoms of PD could therefore alleviate or exacerbate neuropsychiatric features, depending on prevailing dopamine receptor stimulation within these systems. Fur-thermore, the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus, tar-geted for deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment of PD, also have connections with limbic and cognitive cortical areas, making it difficult to restrict treatment purely on the motor syndrome. Neuronal loss within other pigmented brainstem nuclei in parkinsonian patients leads to a variable and pro-gressive loss of other neurotransmitters as the disease process progresses, including acetylcholine, noradrena-line, and serotonin, rendering the individual increasingly susceptible to the psychotropic effects of dopaminergic and surgical treatments. There {{is likely to be a}} genetic pre-disposition toward this susceptibility, for example, via receptor polymorphisms, making it difficult to predict the neuropsychiatric complications of pharmacological and surgical interventions in a given PD patient. This review will consider neuropsychiatric problems related to the pharmacological and surgical therapies used to treat PD...|$|R
40|$|Nocardia asteroides {{can cause}} infections {{in the brain}} of humans {{and a variety of}} animals. In mice, {{invasion}} of the central nervous system results in specific neurologic signs. Following intravenous injection of various doses of log-phase N. asteroides GUH- 2 into female BALB/c mice, localization and growth of nocardial cells within the brains were determined, histopathological sections were prepared, and Nissl substance and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity were observed. Mice were monitored for the development of neurologic signs, and their responsiveness to L-dopa was determined. It was shown that nocardial cells became localized within specific regions of the brain and then underwent rapid growth followed by a delayed clearance, and there was no inflammatory response at the site of invasion for 24 h. Mice that received a subclinical dose of nocardiae developed specific neurologic signs that emerged following the elimination of nocardial cells from the brain. On the basis of the specific signs, mice could be divided into distinct groups. One group consisted of animals that had a form of hemiparesis that did not respond to L-dopa. They expressed a deviation of the head and a tendency to roll, and when suspended by the tail they would spin rapidly. The second group of mice developed a rhythmic, uncontrolled vertical shake of the head (four to five times per s) tremulous movement, stooped posture, restlessness, and no signs of hemiparesis. The head shakes were temporarily stopped by treatment with L-dopa. Mice that expressed head shakes had a loss of Nissl substance and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the neurons of the substantia nigra and <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> <b>areas</b> of the brain. Hyaline inclusion bodies that resembled Lewy bodies were found in the neurons of mice with head shake 1 month after infection. Therefore, mice infected with N. asteroides may {{serve as a model for}} studying parkinsonian signs and other degenerative diseases involving extrapyramidal and pyramidal systems...|$|R

5|$|Evidence from {{microelectrode}} recordings {{from the}} brains of animals shows that dopamine neurons in the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> <b>area</b> (VTA) and substantia nigra are strongly activated by {{a wide variety of}} rewarding events. These reward-responsive dopamine neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra are crucial for reward-related cognition and serve as the central component of the reward system.The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner....The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.}} The function of dopamine varies in each axonal projection from the VTA and substantia nigra; for example, the VTA–nucleus accumbens shell projection assigns incentive salience ("want") to rewarding stimuli and its associated cues, the VTA–orbitofrontal cortex projection updates the value of different goals in accordance with their incentive salience, the VTA–amygdala and VTA–hippocampus projections mediate the consolidation of reward-related memories, and both the VTA–nucleus accumbens core and substantia nigra–dorsal striatum pathways are involved in learning motor responses that facilitate the acquisition of rewarding stimuli. Some activity within the VTA dopaminergic projections appears to be associated with reward prediction as well.|$|E

25|$|Stimulants used {{to treat}} ADHD raise the {{extracellular}} concentrations of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, which increases cellular communication between neurons that utilize these compounds. The therapeutic benefits are due to noradrenergic effects at the locus coeruleus and the prefrontal cortex and dopaminergic effects at the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> <b>area,</b> nucleus accumbens, and prefrontal cortex.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to its function in energy homeostasis, ghrelin also activates the cholinergic–dopaminergic reward link in inputs to the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> <b>area</b> and in the mesolimbic pathway, a circuit that communicates the hedonic and reinforcing aspects of natural rewards, such as food and addictive drugs such as ethanol. Ghrelin receptors are located on neurons in this circuit. Hypothalamic ghrelin signalling is required for reward from alcohol and palatable/rewarding foods.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Neuroimaging {{studies suggest}} that obese people might show {{hyperactivity}} of brain areas regarding reward processing, and hypoactivity of brain areas concerning cognitive control, when exposed to food cues. Although the effects of bariatric surgery on {{the central nervous system}} and eating behavior are well known, few studies have used neuroimage techniques with the aim of investigating the central effects of bariatric surgery in humans. OBJECTIVES: This paper systematically and critically reviews studies using functional neuroimaging to investigate changes on the patterns of activation of central areas related to the regulation of eating behavior after bariatric surgery. METHOD: A search on the databases Medline, Web of Science, Lilacs and Science Direct on Line, was conducted in February 2013, using the keywords "Neuroimaging", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Gastric Bypass", "Gastroplasty", "Jejunoileal Bypass", "Bariatric Surgery". RESULTS: Seven manuscripts were included; the great majority studied the central effects of Roux en Y gastric bypass, using positron emission tomography or functional magnetic resonance. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery might normalize the activity of central areas concerned with reward and incentive salience processing, as the nucleus accumbens and mesencephalic <b>tegmental</b> <b>ventral</b> <b>area,</b> as well as circuitries processing behavioral inhibition, as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex...|$|R
50|$|The {{midbrain}} {{reticular formation}} (MRF; mesencephalic reticular formation; tegmental reticular formation; formatio reticularis (tegmenti) mesencephali) is a {{structure in the}} midbrain consisting of the dorsal <b>tegmental</b> nucleus, <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> nucleus, and cuneiform nucleus.

25|$|Alcohol's {{rewarding}} {{and reinforcing}} (i.e., addictive) properties are mediated through {{its effects on}} dopamine neurons in the mesolimbic reward pathway, which connects the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> <b>area</b> to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). One of alcohol's primary effects is the allosteric inhibition of NMDA receptors and facilitation of GABAA receptors (e.g., enhanced GABAA receptor-mediated chloride flux through allosteric regulation of the receptor). At high doses, ethanol inhibits most ligand gated ion channels and voltage gated ion channels in neurons as well. Alcohol inhibits sodium-potassium pumps in the cerebellum and this is likely how it impairs cerebellar computation and body co-ordination.|$|E
25|$|To date, TAAR1 {{has been}} {{identified}} and cloned in five different mammal genomes: human, mouse, rat, monkey, and chimpanzee. In rats, mRNA for TAAR1 is found at low to moderate levels in peripheral tissues like the stomach, kidney, and lungs, and at low levels in the brain. Rhesus monkey Taar1 and human TAAR1 (hTAAR1) share high sequence similarity, and TAAR1 mRNA is highly expressed in the same important monoaminergic regions of both species. These regions include the dorsal and ventral caudate nucleus, putamen, substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens, <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> <b>area,</b> locus coeruleus, amygdala, and raphe nucleus. TAAR1 has also been identified in human astrocytes.|$|E
25|$|In humans {{there are}} two subtypes of {{melatonin}} receptors targeted by melatonin agonists, MT1 and MT2. They are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body, together or singly. MT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> <b>area</b> and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.|$|E

500|$|The {{largest and}} most {{important}} sources of dopamine in the vertebrate brain are the substantia nigra and <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> <b>area.</b> [...] These structures {{are closely related to}} each other and functionally similar in many respects. [...] Both are components of the basal ganglia, a complex network of structures located mainly {{at the base of the}} forebrain. [...] The largest component of the basal ganglia is the striatum.

40|$|Gudden's tegmental nuclei provide major inputs to the rodent mammillary bodies, {{where they}} {{are thought to be}} {{important}} for learning and navigation. Comparable projections have yet to be described in the primate brain, where part of the problem has been in effectively delineating these nuclei. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue from a series of macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) showed that cells in the region of both the <b>ventral</b> and dorsal <b>tegmental</b> nuclei selectively stain for parvalbumin, thus helping to reveal these nuclei. These same tegmental nuclei were not selectively revealed when tissue was stained for SMI 32, acetylcholinesterase, calbindin, or calretinin. In a parallel study, horseradish peroxidase was injected into the mammillary bodies of five cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Retrogradely labeled neurons were consistently found in the three subdivisions of the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> nucleus of Gudden, which are located immediately below, within, and above the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Further projections to the mammillary body region arose from cells in the anterior tegmental nucleus, which appears to be a rostral continuation of the infrafascicular part of the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> nucleus. In the dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden, labeled cells were most evident when the tracer injection was more laterally placed in the mammillary bodies, consistent with a projection to the lateral mammillary nucleus. The present study not only demonstrates that the primate mammillary bodies receive parallel inputs from the dorsal and <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> nuclei of Gudden, but also helps to confirm the extent of these poorly distinguished nuclei in the monkey brain...|$|R
50|$|The mammillotegmental {{fasciculus}} {{emerges from}} the principal mammillary fasciculus of the mammillary body and travels dorsally together with the mammillothalamic tract before splitting off and turning caudally to enter the spinal column.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 50 years, {{anatomical}} models of memory have repeatedly highlighted the hippocampal inputs to the mammillary bodies via the postcommissural fornix. Such models downplay other projections to the mammillary bodies, leaving them largely ignored. The present study challenged this dominant view by removing, in rats, the two principal inputs reaching the mammillary bodies: the postcommissural fornix from the hippocampal formation and Gudden's <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> nucleus. The principal mammillary body output pathway, the mammillothalamic tract, was disconnected {{in a third}} group. Only mammillothalamic tract and Gudden's <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmental</b> nucleus lesions impaired behavioral tests of spatial working memory and, in particular, disrupted the use of extramaze spatial landmarks. The same lesions also produced widespread reductions in immediate-early gene (c-fos) expression in a network of memory-related regions, not seen after postcommissural fornix lesions. These findings are inconsistent with previous models of mammillary body function (those dominated by hippocampal inputs) and herald {{a new understanding of}} why specific diencephalic structures are vital for memory...|$|R
500|$|Dopaminergic neurons (dopamine-producing nerve cells) are {{comparatively}} few in number—a {{total of}} around 400,000 {{in the human}} brain—and their cell bodies are confined in groups to a few relatively small brain areas.

40|$|Midbrain {{dopamine}} neurons are {{an essential}} part of the circuitry underlying motivation and reinforcement. They are activated by rewards or reward-predicting cues and inhibited by reward omission. The lateral habenula (lHb), an epithalamic structure that forms reciprocal connections with midbrain dopamine neurons, shows the opposite response being activated by reward omission or aversive stimuli and inhibited by reward-predicting cues. It has been hypothesized that habenular input to midbrain dopamine neurons is conveyed via a feedforward inhibitory pathway involving the GABAergic mesopontine rostromedial <b>tegmental</b> <b>area.</b> Here, we show that exposing rats to low-intensity footshock (four, 0. 5 mA shocks over 20 min) induces cFos expression in the rostromedial <b>tegmental</b> <b>area</b> and that this effect is prevented by lesions of the fasciculus retroflexus, the principal output pathway of the habenula. cFos expression is also observed in the medial portion of the lateral habenula, an area that receives dense DA innervation via the fr and the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, a stress sensitive area that also receives dopaminergic input. High-intensity footshock (120, 0. 8 mA shocks over 40 min) also elevates cFos expression in the rostromedial <b>tegmental</b> <b>area,</b> medial and lateral aspects of the lateral habenula and the paraventricular thalamus. In contrast to low-intensity footshock, increases in cFos expression within the rostromedial <b>tegmental</b> <b>area</b> are not altered by fr lesions suggesting a role for non-habenular inputs during exposure to highly aversive stimuli. These data confirm the involvement of the lateral habenula in modulating the activity of rostromedial <b>tegmental</b> <b>area</b> neurons in response to mild aversive stimuli and suggest that dopamine input may contribute to footshock- induced activation of cFos expression in the lateral habenula...|$|R
