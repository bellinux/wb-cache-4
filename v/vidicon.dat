5|$|Landsat 1 had two {{sensors to}} achieve its primary objectives: the return beam <b>vidicon</b> (RBV) and the {{multispectral}} scanner (MSS).|$|E
5|$|From launch until 1974, Landsat 1 {{transmitted}} over 100,000 images, which covered {{more than}} 75% of the Earth's surface. The {{majority of these}} images were taken with the multispectral scanner. On 05 August 1972 the return beam <b>vidicon</b> failed after taking only 1690 images.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the case}} of its {{predecessor}} Landsat 1, the satellite's payload included two remote sensing instruments, the Return Beam <b>Vidicon</b> (RBV) and the Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS). The specifications for these instruments were identical to those of the instruments carried on Landsat 1. The data acquired by the MSS was considered more scientifically useful than the data returned from the RBV, which was rarely used and considered only for engineering evaluation purposes.|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} development {{and evaluation of}} infrared <b>vidicons</b> for use in solving high precision high flux broadband astronomical problems are discussed. Data cover the EOS, silicon, and doped germanium <b>vidicons.</b> Results are graphed and problems encountered using the <b>vidicons</b> in electrical cameras are reported...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of detecting electrical corona discharge phenomena {{in a space}} simulation chamber via emission of ultraviolet light was evaluated. A corona simulator, with a hemispherically capped point to plane electrode geometry, was used to generate corona glows {{over a wide range}} of pressure, voltage, current, electrode gap length and electrode point radius. Several ultraviolet detectors, including a copper cathode gas discharge tube and a UV enhanced silicon photodiode detector, were evaluated {{in the course of the}} spectral intensity measurements. The performance of both silicon target <b>vidicons</b> and silicon intensified target <b>vidicons</b> was evaluated analytically using the data generated by the spectroradiometer scans and the performance data supplied by the manufacturers...|$|R

5|$|Voyager 1s Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS), now disabled, {{consisted}} of two cameras: a 200mm focal length, low-resolution wide-angle camera (WA), used for spatially extended imaging, and a 1500mm high-resolution narrow-angle camera (NA) – the one that took Pale Blue Dot – intended for detailed imaging of specific targets. Both cameras were of the slow-scan <b>vidicon</b> tube type and were fitted with eight colored filters, mounted on a filter wheel {{placed in front of}} the tube.|$|E
5|$|Pale Blue Dot, {{which was}} {{taken with the}} narrow-angle camera, was also {{published}} {{as part of a}} composite picture created from a wide-angle camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The wide-angle image was inset with two narrow-angle pictures: Pale Blue Dot and a similar photograph of Venus. The wide-angle photograph was taken with the darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera's <b>vidicon</b> tube with scattered sunlight. Even so, the result was a bright burned-out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera and the Sun that appears far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide-angle lens.|$|E
25|$|The scan {{platform}} comprises: the Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) (largest {{camera at}} top right); the Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS) {{just above the}} UVS; the two Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) <b>vidicon</b> cameras {{to the left of}} the UVS; and the Photopolarimeter System (PPS) under the ISS.|$|E

25|$|The Imaging Science Subsystem, {{made up of}} a {{wide angle}} and a narrow angle camera, is a {{modified}} version of the slow scan <b>vidicon</b> camera designs that were used in the earlier Mariner flights. The Imaging Science Subsystem consists of two television-type cameras, each with eight filters in a commandable filter wheel mounted in front of the vidicons. One has a low resolution 200mm focal length wide-angle lens with an aperture of f/3 (the wide angle camera), while the other uses a higher resolution 1500mm narrow-angle f/8.5 lens (the narrow angle camera).|$|E
500|$|In 1960 Philips invented an imaging tube {{called the}} Plumbicon {{to replace the}} <b>vidicon</b> and Image Orthicon tubes used in studio {{television}} cameras. The technical advantages of this new tube allowed true color fidelity {{to be seen in}} television broadcasts for the first time. In 1967 the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences presented Philips with an Emmy Award for [...] "Outstanding Achievement in Engineering Development" [...] for the invention of the Plumbicon tube.|$|E
500|$|Landsat 2 is {{the second}} {{satellite}} of the Landsat program. The spacecraft originally carried a designation of ERTS-B (Earth Resource Technology Satellite B) but was renamed [...] "Landsat 2" [...] prior to its launch on January 22, 1975. The objective of the satellite was to acquire global, seasonal data in medium resolution from a near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit. The satellite, built by General Electric, acquired data with the Return Beam <b>Vidicon</b> (RBV) and the Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS). Despite having a design life of one year, Landsat 2 operated for over seven years, finally ceasing operations on February 25, 1982.|$|E
50|$|The entire {{imaging system}} was imperiled when {{electric}} heaters {{attached to the}} cameras failed to turn on immediately after launch. To avoid the Sun's damaging heat, the cameras were deliberately placed on the spacecraft side facing away from the Sun. Consequently, the heaters were needed to prevent the cameras from losing heat and become so cold that they would become damaged. JPL engineers found that the <b>vidicons</b> could generate enough heat through normal operation to stay just above the critical temperature of -40 °C; therefore they advised against turning off the cameras during the flight. Fortunately, test photos of the Earth and Moon showed that image quality had not been significantly affected. The mission team was pleasantly surprised when the camera heaters started working on January 17, two months after launch. Later investigation concluded that a short circuit in a different location on the probe had prevented the heater from turning on. This allowed the <b>vidicons</b> to be turned off as needed.|$|R

2500|$|The {{concept of}} SSTV was {{introduced}} by Copthorne Macdonald in 195758. He developed the first SSTV system using an electrostatic monitor and a <b>vidicon</b> tube. In those days it seemed sufficient to use 120 lines and about 120 pixels per line to transmit a black-and-white still picture within a 3kHz phone channel. First live tests were performed on the 11 Meter ham band which was later given to the CB service in the US. [...] In the 1970s, two forms of paper printout receivers were invented by hams.|$|E
2500|$|In 1961 they {{acquired}} Associated Electrical Industries Valve business based in Lincoln. Sir Charles Oatley was {{a director of}} the company from 1966 to 1985. In 1962, EEV opened its first office in America in Buffalo, NY. In the 1970s EEV collaborated with QinetiQ {{in the development of the}} pyroelectric <b>vidicon,</b> the first thermal imaging detector. The company has received 13 Queen's Awards for Technology in its history, most recently in 2006 for low light imaging devices and in 2004 for thyratrons for cancer radiotherapy treatment. Also, in 1972, they opened an office in Paris, France and in 1977 they opened another office in NY but this time in Elmsford.|$|E
2500|$|CURV-III had a {{functional}} design capable of operations at [...] It had an open metal frame that was [...] by [...] by , weighed approximately , and was slightly buoyant in water. A cable and surface equipment enabled deployment {{and operation of}} the vehicle from a surface support ship. The CURV-III carried: wo <b>Vidicon</b> television cameras, four mercury-vapor headlights, two mercury-vapor spotlights, and a 35-millimeter camera with a 500 frame color film capacity and strobe light ... mounted on two independent pan-and-tilt units, each with 360 degrees of lateral and 180 degrees of vertical movement. The vehicle thus has full viewing and self-inspection capability.Other support systems included active and passive sonar, altimeter, depthometer, and compass. It had a tool assembly mounted on the bow that included a manipulator claw. Other tools and lifting devices could be mounted for particular tasks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vidicons,</b> Plumbicons, {{and image}} intensifiers have {{specific}} applications. The {{speed at which}} they can be sampled depends upon the decay rate of the phosphor used. For example, the P46 phosphor has a decay time of less than 2 microseconds, while the P43 decay time is {{on the order of}} 2-3 milliseconds. The P43 is therefore unusable at frame rates above 1000 frames per second (frame/s). See External links for links to phosphor information.|$|R

50|$|Plumbicon is a {{registered}} trademark of Philips for its Lead(II) oxide (PbO) target <b>vidicons.</b> Used frequently in broadcast camera applications, these tubes have low output, but a high signal-to-noise ratio. They had excellent resolution compared to Image Orthicons, but lacked the artificially sharp edges of IO tubes, which caused some of the viewing audience to perceive them as softer. CBS Labs invented the first outboard edge enhancement circuits to sharpen the edges of Plumbicon generated images.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, in 1934, Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German {{licensee}} company Telefunken. The [...] "image iconoscope" [...] ("Superikonoskop" [...] in Germany) was produced {{as a result}} of the collaboration. This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher (Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television) in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States. The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the <b>vidicon</b> and plumbicon tubes. Indeed, it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon. The German company Heimann produced the Superikonoskop for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, later Heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955, finally the Dutch company Philips produced and commercialized the image iconoscope and multicon from 1952 to 1958.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the Galileo probe to Jupiter in the late 1970s to early 1980s, NASA used <b>Vidicon</b> cameras on nearly all the unmanned deep space probes equipped with the remote sensing ability. [...] <b>Vidicon</b> tubes were also used aboard the first three Landsat earth imaging satellites launched in 1972, as part of each spacecraft's Return Beam <b>Vidicon</b> (RBV) imaging system.|$|E
50|$|A <b>vidicon</b> tube is a {{video camera}} tube design in which the target {{material}} is a photoconductor. The <b>Vidicon</b> {{was developed in the}} 1950s at RCA by P. K. Weimer, S. V.

Magnesium fluoride input windows with Cs-Te photocathodes are used in the converters, with P- 11 phosphors on the fiber optic output windows. Quantum efficiencies, modulation transfer function, background, geometric distortion, and environmental test results are presented for the wavelength region from 1150 to 3500 A. ...|$|R
25|$|The despun section's {{instruments}} {{included the}} camera system; the near infrared mapping spectrometer to make multi-spectral images for atmospheric and moon surface chemical analysis; the ultraviolet spectrometer to study gases; and the photopolarimeter-radiometer to measure radiant and reflected energy. The camera system {{was designed to}} obtain images of Jupiter's satellites at resolutions 20 to 1,000 times better than Voyager best, because Galileo flew closer to the planet and its inner moons, and because the more modern CCD sensor in Galileo camera was more sensitive and had a broader color detection band than the <b>vidicons</b> of Voyager.|$|R
40|$|Future {{instruments}} for the 100 - 10, 000 A UV-wavelength region will require detectors with greater quantum efficiency, smaller picture elements, a greater wavelength range, and greater active area than those currently available.
