40|$|INTRODUCTION: Radiosurgery is an {{alternative}} to the microsurgical resection of vestibular schwannoma (VS). Since its introduction, radiosurgery has been used in more than 8000 patients with VS worldwide and the long term tumor control rates are reported to be 86 to 100 %. The aim {{of this study is to}} report our experience with Leksell Gamma Knife (LGK) radiosurgery in the management of VS and to evaluate the serviceable hearing preservation rate after one-year follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 2000 and October 2002, 95 patients with unilateral VS underwent LGK radiosurgery at the University Erasmus Hospital of Brussels with the first worldwide installed LGK C. All patients in our series underwent evaluation with high resolution neurodiagnostic imaging including computed tomography and MRI, and clinical evaluation as well as audiological tests that included tonal and <b>vocal</b> <b>audiometries.</b> The Gardner Robertson (GR) classification is used to report the results of this study. We identified 48 patients treated for VS with LGK, tested and retested with <b>vocal</b> and tonal <b>audiometries</b> by the same team, and followed for a minimum of one year. There were 38 patients with previously untreated VS (9 grade I, 9 grade II, 20 grade III according to Koos) and 10 patients with postoperative evolutive residual tumor. RESULTS: Before LGK, 24 patients had serviceable (17 GR class I and 7 GR class II) hearing; 16 (67 %) of these patients had preservation of serviceable hearing (Pure tone average 50 %) at the one-year audiological follow-up. It was observed that 9 of the 17 GR class I patients (52. 9 %) maintained their level of audition and 14 of these (82. 3 %) preserved serviceable hearing. No deterioration of hearing occurred in the 7 patients with preradiosurgery radiosurgery nonserviceable hearing (GR class III) at the one-year follow-up. One patient improved from GR class V to III after LGK. No patient developed trigeminal neuropathy and only one patient who had preradiosurgery facial nerve dysfunction experienced deterioration at one-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the high tumor control rate and excellent long-term cranial nerve preservation rates, LGK radiosurgery should now be considered as an excellent alternative strategy to microsurgery for the management of VS grade I to III as well as in cases of residual tumor after microsurgery. Compared to results obtained in centers with long-term experience, our data suggest that LGK radiosurgery is an efficient reproducible therapeutic approach that offers high rate of hearing preservation. This justifies the choice of radiosurgery as the first treatment option in VS...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Few {{population-based}} {{studies have}} quantified hearing levels in Brazil; additional studies {{on this subject}} are needed. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to characterize hearing complaints and the audiological profile of the population served by the Clinical Audiology Service of an Academic Health Center in the western region of São Paulo, Brazil, between 2003 and 2008. An additional aim was to check whether there is a positive association between the signs/symptoms and type of hearing loss. Methods: This was a retrospective study of the records of 2, 145 patients. The health history, tonal and <b>vocal</b> <b>audiometry,</b> and imitanciometry findings were analyzed. Results: The mean age of the patients was 20. 6 years. The majority of the subjects had normal hearing thresholds, and the prevalence of hearing loss was approximately 35 %. As the patient's age increased, the frequency of conductive hearing loss decreased and that of sensorineural hearing loss increased. There was a tendency toward hearing loss worsening with age. Conclusion: Hearing complaints can predict the type of hearing loss; therefore, they should always be valued because they can be used as a form of screening and thus help to determine the diagnostic hypothesis. This could help to reduce the gap between the patient's perception of the complaints and the audiological assessment and thus improve the prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{different}} epidemiological, neurophysiological and morphological studies {{published in the}} literature, {{it is still not}} known for sure whether there is a relation between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and peripheral hearing loss. In this work we conduct an auditory study in patients with AD and in volunteer controls in order to investigate this possible relationship. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The sample studied consisted of 14 patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD (age: 79 Y 6 years) and 14 volunteers (age: 76 Y 5 years) who visited the Clinica Universidad de Navarra. After applying a set of thorough criteria to preclude any previous hearing problems, all the participants underwent a subjective hearing assessment by means of pure-tone threshold audiometry and <b>vocal</b> <b>audiometry</b> and an objective auditory assessment using a tympanometry study, stapedial reflex, otoacoustic emissions and brainstem auditory evoked potentials. For the analysis, patients with AD and controls were paired homogenously by sex and age. RESULTS: The main obstacle hindering the study was to recruit the participants, {{due to the fact that}} they did not see any direct benefit from the study and it demanded an excessive amount of their time. Pure-tone threshold audiometry showed that patients with AD had a pattern of greater hearing loss for acute frequencies, with statistically significant differences. No significant differences were found in the analysis of the rest of the subjective and objective hearing tests. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study both agree and disagree with some earlier works from the literature, which suggests that patients with AD may have their own auditory patter...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Tinnitus is {{considered}} the third worst symptom affecting humans. The aim {{of this article is}} to assess complaints by workers with tinnitus exposed to environmental and occupational noise. Methodology 495 workers went through an epidemiological survey at the Audiology Department of the Center for Studies on Workers’ Health and Human Ecology, from 2003 to 2007. The workers underwent tonal and <b>vocal</b> <b>audiometry,</b> preceded by a clinical and occupational history questionnaire. Two-factor ANOVA and Tukey were the statistical tests used. All the analysis set statistical significance at α= 5 %. Findings There was a higher prevalence of occupational tinnitus (73. 7 %), a predominance of female domestic workers (65. 4 %) in cases of environmental exposure, and predominance of male construction workers (71. 5 %) for occupational exposure. There was a significant difference in workers with hearing loss, who showed a mean speech recognition index (SRI) of 85 %, as compared to healthy workers with a mean SRI greater than 93. 5 %. Signs and symptoms, speech perception, and interference in sound localization with the type of noise exposure (environmental versus occupational) comparisons found no significant differences. Conclusion Studied group’s high prevalence of tinnitus, major difficulties in speech recognition with hearing loss and the presence of individuals with normal hearing with both types of exposure justify the importance of measures in health promotion, prevention, and hearing surveillance. The findings highlight the importance of valuing the patients’ own perception as the first indication of tinnitus and hearing loss in order to help develop appropriate public policies within the Unified National Health System (SUS). </p...|$|E

40|$|Introdução: A comunicação é para o ser humano um ato {{fundamental}} na vida, sendo primordial a preservação auditiva. Com a expectativa de vida aumentando, surge a necessidade de compreendermos melhor os idosos e sua queixa constante de não compreensão da fala em ambiente ruidoso ou com reverberação. Muitos autores relacionam essa dificuldade à perda auditiva neurossensorial (PANS) freqüentemente encontrada nesta população, porém, em muitos casos essa dificuldade parece maior que a esperada dada à quantidade de perda. Este fato nem sempre é detectado por meio dos testes convencionais de audiometria tonal e vocal, que nos fornece dados quanto à perda auditiva do indivíduo sem descrever como esta perda influencia sua vida, sua comunicação do dia-a-dia. Objetivo: Avaliar e comparar o desempenho auditivo de indivíduos idosos com audição normal e com PANS característica de presbiacusia, por meio do Teste de Reconhecimento de Dissílabos em Tarefa Dicótica - SSW. Forma de estudo: clínico prospectivo randomizado. Casuística e Método: Foram avaliados 100 indivíduos idosos com idade entre 60 a 79 anos, sendo que 50 idosos apresentavam PANS característica de presbiacusia (grupo estudo) e 50 idosos com audição tonal dentro dos padrões da normalidade (grupo controle). Anteriormente à aplicação do Teste SSW, foi realizada anamnese, avaliação audiológica e otorrinolaringológica. Conclusão: Não houve diferença estatisticamente significante entre os grupos porém houve uma tendência de pior desempenho nas condições estudadas para o grupo estudo. Constatamos desta forma, que a PANS não pode ser considerada como fator determinante mas sim como um agravante na dificuldade de inteligibilidade de fala do indivíduo idoso. Introduction: For a human being, {{the communication}} {{is an essential}} act {{in his life and}} thus, the preservation of auditory capability is vital. With the growth of life expectancy arises the need to understand better elderly people and their constant complaint of not understanding the speech in noisy environment, or in the environment with reverberation. Many writers relate this difficulty to the neurossensorial auditory loss frequently found in these people. However, in many cases this difficulty seems worse than the expected in view of the amount of hearing lost. This fact is not usually detected by conventional tests of tonal and <b>vocal</b> <b>audiometry</b> which provides the data relative to the auditory loss of the individual without describing how this loss affects his life, his day-by-day communication. Aim: To assess and compare the auditory performance of elderly people, both with normal hearing and with neurossensorial auditory loss characteristical of presbycusis, by SSW Test. Study design: clinical prospective randomized. Cases and method: 100 elderly people have been assessed, aged from 60 through 79. Of this number, 50 individuals showed neurossensorial auditory loss characteristical of presbycusis (a study group) and 50 elderly individuals with tonal hearing within normal standards (a control group). Before applying SSW test, these people had undergone anamnesis and audiologic and otorhinolaryngologic evaluation. Conclusion: No statistically relevant difference has been found between both groups. However, there was a tendency of worse performance of the study group under studied conditions. Thus, we found that the neurossensorial auditory loss cannot be considered as determining factor, but rather as an aggravating one in the elderly difficulty to understand the person’s speech...|$|E
