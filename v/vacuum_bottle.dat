50|$|Alternatively, {{tunneled}} pleural catheters (TPCs) may {{be placed}} in an outpatient setting and often result in auto-pleurodesis, whereby portable <b>vacuum</b> <b>bottles</b> are used to evacuate the pleural fluid. Routine evacuation keeps the pleura together, resulting in physical agitation by the catheter, which slowly causes the pleura to scar together. This method, though the minimally invasive and minimal cost solution, takes {{an average of about}} 30 days to achieve pleurodesis and is therefore the slowest means of achieving pleurodesis among other modalities.|$|R

In this multi-institutional study conducted between March 1994 and February 1997, 144 patients (61 men and 83 women) were randomized in a 2 : 1 distribution to either an indwelling pleural catheter or doxycycline pleurodesis.

To achieve this improved performance, the new feeds are mounted in glass <b>vacuum</b> <b>bottles</b> with plastic lenses that maximize the microwave transmission through the bottles.

50|$|To avoid heat loss, and to {{insulate}} the cabin from its heat, the battery was stored inside a double-walled stainless steel <b>vacuum</b> <b>bottle.</b> This {{allowed it to}} stay warm overnight, and keep its temperature constant even during cold weather, when traditional batteries are less responsive.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: We {{investigated}} the mechanical characteristics of lyophilized human saphenous vein valves {{to determine their}} suitability for use as allogeneic transplants to treat chronic venous insufficiency. Methods: Fresh cadaveric veins were lyophilized in <b>vacuum</b> <b>bottles</b> within 24 hours of harvest and were stored at room temperature. The veins were reconstituted in saline solution and then were placed in an in vitro flow circuit for evaluation. At varied flow rates, pressures proximal and distal to valves during prograde and retrograde flow were measured. Valve closure times were determined with Doppler examination and spectral analysis. The valves were also stressed to 350 mm Hg on a separate apparatus. Results: All pressures proximal and distal to the valves remained less than 10 mm Hg during prograde flow. A pressure gradient developed immediately on the reversal of flow. Pressure as high as 200 mm Hg applied against the closed valves was not transmitted beyond the valve. Valve closure times had a mean of 0. 31 ± 0. 03 seconds and 0. 21 ± 0. 01 seconds for the Doppler examination and spectral analysis, respectively. All valves withstood stress pressures to 350 mm Hg. Conclusions: The in vitro mechanical characteristics of the valves of lyophilized veins are similar to known values for normal in vivo valves. (J Vasc Surg 1997; 26 : 823 - 8. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{a typical}} {{diverter}} switch powerful springs are tensioned by a low power motor (motor drive unit, MDU), and then rapidly released {{to effect the}} tap changing operation. To reduce arcing at the contacts, the tap changer operates in a chamber filled with insulating transformer oil, or inside a vessel filled with pressurized SF6 gas. Reactance-type tap changers, when operating in oil, must allow for the additional inductive transients generated by the autotransformer and commonly include a <b>vacuum</b> <b>bottle</b> contact in parallel with the diverter switch. During a tap change operation, the potential rapidly increases between the two electrodes in the bottle, {{and some of the}} energy is dissipated in an arc discharge through the bottle instead of flashing across the diverter switch contacts.|$|E
50|$|The {{patient is}} {{requested}} to urinate before the procedure; alternately, a Foley catheter {{is used to}} empty the bladder. The patient is positioned in the bed with the head elevated at 45-60 degrees to allow fluid to accumulate in lower abdomen. After cleaning {{the side of the}} abdomen with an antiseptic solution, the physician numbs a small area of skin and inserts a large-bore needle with a plastic sheath 2 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) in length to reach the peritoneal (ascitic) fluid. The needle is removed, leaving the plastic sheath to allow drainage of the fluid. The fluid is drained by gravity, a syringe or by connection to a <b>vacuum</b> <b>bottle.</b> Several litres of fluid may be drained during the procedure; however, if more than two litres are to be drained it will usually be done {{over the course of several}} treatments. After the desired level of drainage is complete, the plastic sheath is removed and the puncture site bandaged. The plastic sheath can be left in place with a flow control valve and protective dressing if further treatments are expected to be necessary.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{vacuum tube}} {{collectors}} {{are used in}} middle Europe use heat pipes for their core instead of passing liquid directly through them. Direct flow is more popular in China. Evacuated heat pipe tubes (EHPTs) are composed of multiple evacuated glass tubes each containing an absorber plate fused to a heat pipe. The heat is transferred to the transfer fluid (water or an antifreeze mix—typically propylene glycol) of a domestic hot water or hydronic space heating system in a heat exchanger called a [...] "manifold". The manifold is wrapped in insulation and covered by a protective sheet metal or plastic case.The vacuum inside of the evacuated tube collectors have been proven to last more than 25 years, the reflective coating for the design is encapsulated in the vacuum inside of the tube, which will not degrade until the vacuum is lost.The vacuum that surrounds {{the outside of the}} tube greatly reduces convection and conduction heat loss, therefore achieving greater efficiency than flat-plate collectors, especially in colder conditions. This advantage is largely lost in warmer climates, except in those cases where very hot water is desirable, e.g., for commercial processes. The high temperatures that can occur may require special design to prevent overheating.Some evacuated tubes (glass-metal) are made with one layer of glass that fuses to the heat pipe at the upper end and encloses the heat pipe and absorber in the vacuum. Others (glass-glass) are made with a double layer of glass fused together at one or both ends with a vacuum between the layers (like a <b>vacuum</b> <b>bottle</b> or flask), with the absorber and heat pipe contained at normal atmospheric pressure. Glass-glass tubes have a highly reliable vacuum seal, but the two layers of glass reduce the light that reaches the absorber. Moisture may enter the non-evacuated area of the tube and cause absorber corrosion. Glass-metal tubes allow more light to reach the absorber, and protect the absorber and heat pipe from corrosion even if they are made from dissimilar materials (see galvanic corrosion).|$|E

40|$|Background: For {{patients}} {{that are expected}} to survive for longer, the risk of complications combined with the need for more <b>vacuum</b> drainage <b>bottles</b> have become barriers to the placement of indwelling pleural catheter (IPC), since these could increase costs. Objetives: The objective of the current article is to determine the cost and efficiency of treating malignant pleural effusion (MPE) with IPC in Spanish hospitals. Methods: We compared the cost {{associated with the use of}} IPC per outpatient and per inpatient. We analyzed the number of consultations, length of hospital stay, and outcome of the procedure. Results: Fifty-five patients were recruited. Spontaneous pleurodesis was achieved in 34. 4 % of the cases. Post-catheterization complications were observed in 7. 2 %. Supplementary procedures were unnecessary and 87. 7 % of the patients reported improved dyspnea. In 64. 9 % of the cases, the IPCs were inserted during hospitalization with a median hospitalization time of 4 days (1 - 7. 5). There were differences in the number of visits with more consultations being observed in the outpatient group. There was no difference in the number of <b>vacuum</b> drainage <b>bottles</b> used. The complications supposed a cost increase of € 1045. 6 per outpatient and € 432. 54 per inpatient. The overall average cost of treatment per outpatient was € 3310. 2 and € 5450. 3 per inpatient. Conclusions: The treatment with IPC was effective, safe, without need of any more procedures and led to improved dyspnea in more than 85 % of the patients. The cost is lower in the outpatient group, although complications represent an increased cost in both groups...|$|R
