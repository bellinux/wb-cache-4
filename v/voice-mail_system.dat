50|$|With virtual telephony, {{each person}} {{could be given}} a phone number (just the number, not the phone) and a voice mailbox. The citizen would also be given a pager. If someone called the phone number, it never rang on an actual phone, but would be routed {{immediately}} to a central <b>voice-mail</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>voice-mail</b> <b>system</b> answered the call and the caller could leave a long, detailed message. As soon as the message was received, the <b>voice-mail</b> <b>system</b> would trigger the citizen's pager. When the page was received, the citizen would find a pay phone and call in {{to pick up the}} message. This concept was used successfully in South America and South Africa.|$|E
50|$|This section {{describes}} how the original style, standalone, voicemail system worked with a corporate PBX. The principle is the same with Central Office Switches (CO Switches) or Mobile Telephone Switching Office (MTSOs). More modern <b>voice-mail</b> <b>systems</b> work on the same principle, {{but some of the}} components may be shared with other systems, such as email systems.|$|R
50|$|Simple {{voicemail}} systems {{function as}} a remote answering machine using touch-tones as the user interface. More complicated systems may use other input devices such as voice or a computer interface. Simpler <b>voice-mail</b> <b>systems</b> may play the audio message through the phone, while more advanced systems may have alternative delivery methods, including email or text message delivery, message transfer and forwarding options, and multiple mailboxes.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the first}} modern day {{voicemail}} applications was invented by Gerald M. Kolodny and Paul Hughes, which was described {{in an article in}} the medical journal, Radiology (Kolodny GM, Cohen HI, Kalisky A. Rapid-access system for radiology reports: a new concept. Radiology. 1974;111(3):717-9) A patent was applied for by Kolodny and Hughes in 1975, prior to the patent applications of both Elkins and Matthews and was issued in 1981 (U.S. patent 4,260,854). The patent was assigned to Sudbury Systems of Sudbury Massachusetts who proceeded to market and sell such systems to corporations and hospitals. IBM, Sony and Lanier, as well as several smaller makers of <b>voice-mail</b> <b>systems,</b> licensed the Sudbury patent for their <b>voice-mail</b> <b>systems.</b> A patent suit, brought by Pitney Bowes, claiming prior art to the Sudbury patent, was denied by the U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut on November 8, 2000. A similar suit brought byVDI Technologies against the Kolodny and Hughes patent claiming prior art was dismissed by the U.S. District Court in New Hampshire on 12/19/1991.|$|R
50|$|Almost {{all modern}} {{voicemail}} systems use digital storage and are typically stored on computer data storage. Notification methods also vary {{based on the}} <b>voice-mail</b> <b>system.</b> Simple systems may not provide active notification at all, instead requiring the recipient to check with the system, while others may provide an indication that messages are waiting.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{technology for}} autodialers {{is the ability}} to distinguish live human pick-ups from answering machines. Since there is no indication hardware signal when a call is answered by an answering machine or <b>voice-mail</b> <b>system,</b> autodialer systems have to analyze incoming audio for a prediction. Currently, no algorithms exist that can achieve 100% accuracy.|$|E

50|$|Corporate voice-mail did {{not change}} much until the advent of Voice over IP (VoIP—voice being {{transmitted}} over the internet) {{and the development of}} IP telephony applications to replace legacy PBX telephony (called TDM technologies). IP (Internet Protocol) telephony changed the style and technology of PBXs and the way <b>voice-mail</b> <b>systems</b> integrated with them. This, in turn, facilitated a new generation of Unified Messaging, which is now likely to catch on widely. The flexibility, manageability, lower costs, reliability, speed, and user convenience for messaging convergence is now possible where it wasn't before. This might include intra- and inter-enterprise contacts, mobile contacts, proactive application information delivery, and customer contact applications.|$|R
5000|$|Playback {{controls}} (like rewind, pause, fast forward, changing volume, etc.) are all input via Touch-tones, are [...] "read" [...] by the CPU, and {{the appropriate}} actions are taken based on the stored program in the system. For example, if Fred wants to pause message playback, he might press 2. Since the CPU is constantly listening for Touch-tones from Fred, his command causes the CPU to direct the Disk Controller to stop playing the message. A variety of playback controls and options are available on most sophisticated <b>voice-mail</b> <b>systems</b> so that users can control message playback, store messages in archives, send messages to groups, change their preferences, etc.|$|R
40|$|Speech {{recognition}} is potentially a multi-billion dollar {{industry in the}} near future. It is a natural alternative interface to computers for people with limited mobility in their arms and hands, sight, hearing limitation. For most current <b>voice-mail</b> <b>systems,</b> one has to follow series of touch-tone button presses to navigate through a hierarchical menu. Speech Recognition {{has the potential to}} cut through the menu hierarchy. Recently, neural networks have been considered for speech recognition tasks since in many cases they have shown comparable performance than the traditional approaches. There are two in-built threads in the recognition system. Thread 1 maintains the details about input acquisition where as thread 2 contains the classifier and decoder. The classifier used in this research is Radial Basis Function Neural Networks. The HMM graph is used as a decoder. The objective of the research {{is to make sure that}} the system is free from bugs. 100 % accuracy is achieved by the recognition system...|$|R

50|$|Boston Technology, uReach Technologies and Comverse Technology all {{entered the}} carrier {{market in the}} early 1990s. Boston was {{eventually}} acquired by Comverse, making it the second largest supplier to carriers after Octel. However, {{in a few years}} Comverse became the largest supplier to carriers with Lucent/Octel holding its leadership in the corporate market and second place with carriers. Comverse today retains its leadership of legacy voicemail systems sold to carriers around the world. For IP-based voicemail systems, Ericsson claims market leadership with its Ericsson Messaging-over-IP (MoIP) solution. uReach provides VoiceMail services for Verizon {{and a host of other}} Tier 1 and Tier 2 carriers and is the <b>voice-mail</b> <b>system</b> used by Verizon FIOS. uReach Technologies was acquired by GENBAND in 2014.|$|E
5000|$|On 3 May 1998, The Cincinnati Enquirer {{published}} an eighteen-page section, [...] "Chiquita Secrets Revealed" [...] by investigative reporters Michael Gallagher and Cameron McWhirter. The section accused {{the company of}} mistreating workers on its Central American plantations, polluting the environment, allowing cocaine {{to be brought to}} Borneo on its ships, bribing foreign officials, evading foreign nations' laws on land ownership, forcibly preventing its workers from unionizing, {{and a host of other}} misdeeds. [...] Chiquita denied all the allegations, and sued after it was revealed that Gallagher had repeatedly hacked into Chiquita's <b>voice-mail</b> <b>system.</b> (No evidence ever indicated that McWhirter was aware of Gallagher's crime or a participant.) A special prosecutor was appointed to investigate, because the elected prosecutor at the time had ties to Carl Lindner, Jr.|$|E
50|$|Paging {{systems support}} several popular direct {{connection}} protocols, including TAP, TNPP, SNPP, and WCTP, {{as well as}} proprietary modem- and socket-based protocols. Additionally, organizations often integrate paging <b>systems</b> with their <b>Voice-mail</b> and PBX <b>systems,</b> conceptually attaching pagers to a telephone extensions, and they set up web portals to integrate pagers into other parts of their enterprise. A paging system alerts a pager (or group of pagers) by transmitting information over an RF channel, including an address and message information. This information is formatted using a paging protocol, such as 2-tone, 5/6-tone, GOLAY, POCSAG, FLEX, ERMES, or NTT. Two-way pagers and response pagers typically use the ReFLEX protocol.|$|R
50|$|Pay-per-call {{applications}} dated back to {{as early}} as 1971. Typically a caller would dial an advertised phone number with a 900 or 976 prefix. The caller would be billed a fixed amount per minute by the phone company. The phone company kept {{a portion of the}} revenue with the balance going to the sponsor of the call. There were many pay-per-call services: sports scores, weather forecasts, even dating lines. A new twist was added to this mix {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s. It was known as Audiotext, a relatively simple concept that combined a pay-per-call application with sophisticated answering machine technology ("IVR"). A person would call a 900 number and enter the voice mailbox number of the service or person for whom they wished to leave a message. Much like a <b>voice-mail</b> <b>system</b> in typical office environments, the person who owned the mailbox could listen to the recorded message at a later time and respond appropriately.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1990s, the Amway {{organization}} {{was a major}} contributor to the Republican Party (GOP) and to the election campaigns of various GOP candidates. Amway and its sales force contributed a substantial amount (up to half) of the total funds ($669,525) for the 1994 political campaign of Republican congresswoman and Amway distributor Sue Myrick (N.C.). According to two reports by Mother Jones magazine, Amway distributor Dexter Yager [...] "used the company's extensive <b>voice-mail</b> <b>system</b> to rally hundreds of Amway distributors into giving a total of $295,871" [...] to Myrick's campaign. According to a campaign staffer quoted by the magazine, Myrick had appeared regularly on the Amway circuit, speaking at hundreds of rallies and selling $5 and $10 audiotapes. Following the 1994 election, Myrick maintained [...] "close ties to Amway and Yager", and raised $100,000 from Amway sources, [...] "most notably through fundraisers at the homes of big distributors", in the 1997-98 election cycle.|$|E
40|$|Voice-mail and video-mail {{systems for}} the Internet are {{becoming}} very popular, because the speech and video compression technology is greatly improved in these days. Asynchronous <b>voice-mail</b> <b>system,</b> however, does not seem attractive because it's not designed for discussions. We propose a network-based voice conference system which enables asynchronous and bi-directional discussions. The system displays the voice messages as the threaded written words. The user can manipulate voice messages just {{as if they are}} text messages. If the participant wants to quote or annotate to a message, the user has only to play the sound and barge into the message while it is playing. Such user interface increases the usefulness of the <b>voice-mail</b> <b>system.</b> We performed a preliminary experiment to evaluate the proposed conversation method. The voice messages are transcribed manually, because our system is not integrated with the speech recognition at present. Using the system, asynchronous v [...] ...|$|E

" Reflexively, mobile technology also creates {{new opportunities for}} data collection while participants are remotely located. We report on our experiences with {{a variation on the}} paperbased diary study technique, which we extend by using voice-mail paired with mobile and landline telephony to more easily collect data in natural situations. We discuss lessons learned from experiences with voice-mail diary studies in two investigations of different scope. We also present suggestions for tailoring the technique to different research objectives, garnering high subject participation, and configuring the <b>voice-mail</b> <b>system</b> for data collection...|$|E
