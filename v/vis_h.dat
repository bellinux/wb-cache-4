40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to use MCM- 22 zeolites for {{preparation}} of monometallic (Cu or Au) and bimetallic (Cu and Au) catalysts for oxidation reactions. The focus was on precise determination {{of the nature of}} gold and copper species and their activity in the oxidation processes. For that purpose several characterization techniques were applied (XRD, N 2 adsorption/desorption, TEM, SEM, UV − <b>vis,</b> <b>H</b> 2 -TPR, 27 Al MAS NMR, FT-IR with the adsorption of pyridine, NO, and CO, ESR spectroscopy). They allowed us to de fi ne the following species formed on MCM- 22 surface: metallic gold particles (XRD, UV − vis), isolated Cu 2 + with octahedral coordination (UV − vis, ESR), square planar Cu 2 + cations (ESR, IR), Cu + species (ESR+NO, FTIR+CO, and FTIR+NO), and oligonuclear clusters (UV − vis) as well as CuO-like species (H 2 -TPR). The presence of gold on the MCM- 22 surface modi fi ed further by copper species caused the interaction between two modi fi ers leading to much easier reduction of CuO-like species and higher mobility of oxygen-promoting oxidative properties. The bimetallic catalyst was highly active in total oxidation of methanol and CO in the temperature range 523 − 623 K. Cu/Au-MCM- 22 zeolite appeared useful for simultaneous removal of CO and methanol (by total oxidation) from gases emitted from automotive devices and during a variety of industrial process operations...|$|E

40|$|Reduced {{graphene}} oxide (rGO) {{was applied}} to prepare various composites of rGO/photocatalyst of G/TiO 2, G/ZnO and G/Ta 2 O 5, using titanium (IV) isopropoxide, Zn powder and commercial Ta 2 O 5 powder as photocatalyst precursors, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) and UV–vis diffuse reflectance (UV–vis DRS) were employed to investigate the crystal structure, morphology, surface groups, rGO loading, and optical properties of the produced composites. The photocatalytic activities of the composites under UV–vis and visible light were studied in degradation of methylene blue (MB). G/Ta 2 O 5 showed an enhanced efficiency under UV–vis irradiation. G/TiO 2 demonstrated an effective degradation of MB under visible light. The effects of various oxidants, peroxymonosulfate (PMS), peroxydisulfate (PDS) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) on MB degradation were thoroughly investigated.

40|$|AbstractSimulations of a {{neural network}} model of retino-cortical {{dynamics}} (Öğmen H, Neural Netw 6 (1993) 245 – 273) are presented. The temporal-step response of the model to a single dot (spatial impulse) consists of three post-retinal phases: reset, feed-forward dominant and feedback dominant. In response to a single moving dot, the model predicts the perception of extensive blur. This extensive blur is proposed {{to be due to}} the relative spatial and temporal offsets between transient and sustained signals conveyed from retina to post-retinal levels. In response to a pair of horizontally separated dots moving in the horizontal direction, the model predicts extensive blur for the trailing dot irrespective of dot-to-dot separation. For the leading dot, the model predicts a decrease in perceived blur for long exposure durations when dot-to-dot separations are small. The reduction of perceived blur at long exposure durations for small dot-to-dot separations is proposed to stem from the spatio-temporal overlap between the transient activity generated by the trailing dot and the sustained activity generated by the leading dot. The model also predicts that targets moving at higher speeds generate more blur even when blur is normalized with respect to speed. The mechanism in the model generating this effect is a slow inhibition within the sustained channel. These predictions are compared with recent psychophysical data (Chen S, Bedell HE, Öğmen <b>H,</b> <b>Vis</b> Res 35 (1995) 2315 – 2328) and are found to be in excellent agreement. The model is used to offer a coherent explanation for several controversial findings published in the literature. This computational study shows that a model without any motion-compensation mechanism can give a good account of motion deblurring phenomenon and supplements our recent experimental study which provided evidence against motion-compensation type models in explaining the motion deblurring phenomenon (Chen S, Bedell HE, Öğmen <b>H,</b> <b>Vis</b> Res 35 (1995) 2315 – 2328) ...|$|R

We retrospectively collected information on 154 eligible SS patients who were admitted to Fukuyama City Hospital Emergency Medical Center and {{did not respond to}} fluid resuscitation. To compare their degree of hemodynamic impairment, we compared the changes in the vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS) in the calcium-treated group (n＝ 112) and the noncalcium-treated group (n＝ 42). We compared the length of stay {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) and hospital, in-hospital deaths, 28 -day deaths, and changes in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score within 72 h of ICU admission between the 2 groups. Changes in the <b>VIS</b> at 1 <b>h</b> after the baseline time were significantly greater in the calcium-treated group than in the noncalcium-treated group (1. 41 vs. － 1. 25, respectively;p＜ 0. 001).

40|$|OBJECTIVES Prior {{studies have}} {{established}} peak postoperative lactate and the vasoactive-inotrope score (VIS) as modest predictors of outcome following paediatric cardiac surgery. We developed a novel vasoactive-ventilation-renal (VVR) score and aimed {{to determine if}} this index, which incorporates postoperative respiratory, cardiovascular and renal function, would more consistently predict outcome in this patient population. METHODS We performed an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective analysis of 222 infants at our institution less than 365 days old who underwent surgery for congenital heart disease at our centre from January 2009 to April 2013. The VVR score was calculated as follows: vasoactive-inotrope score + ventilation index + (change in serum creatinine from baseline × 10). For all patients, peak lactate and admission, peak, and 48 <b>h</b> <b>VIS</b> and VVR were recorded. RESULTS For all outcome measures, areas under the curve for 48 -h VVR were greater than its corresponding admission and peak values, VIS alone at all three time points and peak lactate. On multivariate regression, 48 -h VVR was strongly associated with prolonged intubation [odds ratio (OR) : 39. 13, P < 0. 0001], significantly more so than 48 -h VIS (odds ratio: 6. 18, P < 0. 0001) and peak lactate (odds ratio: 2. 52, P = 0. 017). The 48 -h VVR was also more significantly associated with prolonged use of vasoactive infusions, chest tube drainage and ICU and hospital stay when compared with VIS alone and peak lactate. CONCLUSIONS The novel 48 -h VVR was a robust predictor of outcome following paediatric cardiac surgery and outperformed the VIS and peak postoperative lactate...|$|R
40|$|Renewed {{interest}} in absorption of H and D into transition metals has been stimulated by current work on metal-hy-dride anodes for rechargeable batteries {{and by the}} intense {{interest in}} recently studied anomalous phenomena associated with absorption of D into Pd. One principal p rob lem in this field is how site-blocking elements (SBE), also called "catalyst poisons " (P), co-adsorbed with H on transition metal H hosts, usually substantially p romote the absorption of H {{into a number of}} such metals, yet such poisons are known to inhibit cathodic H 2 evolution and diminish surface coverage by H, the intermediate in the latter process and the source of the absorbed H. These effects of catalyst poisons in promot ing H absorption into host metals are examined in terms of effects of competitive adsorption between the poison and H at the surface. Convent ional ideas about these effects are inconsistent with information on diminution of H coverage caused by competitive adsorption of poisons. Consideration of various possibilities indicates that the enhancement of H absorption by SBEs can arise only on account of direct interaction effects and long-range indirect electronic charge-density effects. Numer ica l simulation calculations are given on the competitive chemisorption of <b>H</b> <b>vis</b> ~ visa poison, P, in relation to the configurational contribution to the G ibbs energy of the adlayer, H + P.

Six-minute walk test in {{patients}} with Down syndrome: validity and reproducibility. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2009; 90 : 1423 - 7. Objectives: To examine {{the validity of the}} six-minute walk test (6 MWT) as a tool to evaluate functional exercise performance {{in patients}} with Down syndrome (DS). Design: Comparison of the six-minute walk distance (6 MWD) in 2 distinct groups of DS patients: with and without severe cardiac disease. To test reproducibility, a group of patients with DS performed the 6 MWT twice. Setting: Tertiary referral centers for patients with congenital heart defects and outpatient clinics for people with intellectual disabilities. Participants: Adult patients with DS with (n= 29) and without (n= 52) severe cardiac disease categorized by cardiac echocardiography. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure: Distance walked on the 6 MWT. Results: The mean 6 MWD in the group with severe cardiac disease was 289 +/- 104 m and in the group without severe cardiac disease 280 +/- 104 m (P=. 70). Older age, female sex, and severe level of intellectual disability were all found to be independently and significantly correlated with a lower 6 MWD (r=. 67, P <. 001). The paired 6 MWD was not significantly different (310 +/- 88 m vs 317 +/- 85 m; P=. 40) in patients who performed the 6 MWT twice. The coefficient of variation was 11 %. Conclusions: The 6 MWD between the 2 groups was not significantly different. However, the walking distance inversely correlated with the level of intellectual disability. Therefore, the 6 MWT is not a valid test to examine cardiac restriction in adult patients with D...|$|R
40|$|The electron-transfer {{reaction}} between reduced cobalamin (Cbl(II)) {{and sodium}} pentacyano- nitrosylferrate(II) (sodium nitroprusside, NP), {{as well as}} the subsequent processes following the electron- transfer step, were investigated by spectroscopic (UV - <b>vis,</b> 1 <b>H</b> NMR, EPR), electrochemical (CV, DPV) and kinetic (stopped-flow) techniques. In an effort to clarify the complex reaction pattern observed at physiological pH, systematic spectroscopic and kinetic studies were undertaken as a function of pH (1. 8 - 9) and NP concentration (0. 0001 - 0. 09 M). The kinetics of the electron-transfer reaction was studied under pseudo-first-order conditions with respect to NP. The reaction occurs in two parallel paths of different order, viz. pseudo-first and pseudo-second order with respect to the NP concentration, respectively. The contribution of each path depends on pH and the [NP]/[Cbl(II) ] ratio. At low pH and total NP concentration (pH < 3, [NP]/[Cbl(II) ] 1), the cyano-bridged successor complex [Cbl(III) - (Ì -NC) -Fe I (CN) 3 (NO +) ] - (1 s) is the final reaction product formed in an inner-sphere electron transfer reaction that is coupled to the release of cyanide from coordinated nitroprusside. At higher pH, subsequent reactions were observed which involve the attack of cyanide released in the electron transfer step on the initially formed cyano-bridged species, and lead to the formation of Cbl(III) CN and [Fe I (CN) 4 (NO +) ] 2 -. The strong dependence of the rate and mechanism of the subsequent reactions on pH is attributed to the large variation in the effective nucleophilicity of the cyanide ligand in the studied pH range. An alternative electron-transfer pathway observed in the presence of excess NP involves the reaction of the precursor complex [Cbl(II) - (Ì -NC) - Fe II (CN) 4 (NO +) ] 2 - (1 p) with NP to give [Cbl(III) - (Ì -NC) - Fe II (CN) 4 (NO +) ] - (2) and reduced nitroprusside, [Fe(CN) 5 NO] 3 -,as the initial reaction products. Analysis of the kinetic data allowed elucidation of the rate constants for the inner- and outer-sphere electron-transfer pathways. The main factors which influence the kinetics and thermodynamics of the observed electron-transfer steps are discussed {{on the basis of the}} spectroscopic, kinetic and electrochemical results. A general picture of the reaction pathways that occur on a short (s) and long (min to h) time scale as a function of pH and relative reactant concentrations is derived from the experimental data. In addition, the release of NO resulting from the one-electron reduction of NP by Cbl(II) was monitored with the use of a sensitive NO electrode. The results obtained in the present study are discussed in reference to the possible influence of cobalamin on the pharmacological action of nitroprusside...|$|R
