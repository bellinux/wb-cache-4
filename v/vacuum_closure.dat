We have utilized this technique by using simple locally available {{material in the}} management of our patients on outpatient basis. The objective {{of this study is to}} present our experience. METHODS: This study was conducted from June 2011 to June 2013 at Dow University Hospital and Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. There were 38 patients managed with <b>vacuum</b> assisted <b>closure.</b> Mean age was 56 ± 7. 8 years. Twenty three patients presented with necrotizing fasciitis and 15 patients with gangrene. Lower limbs were involved in majority of the patients. Debridement or amputations were done. Vacuum dressing was changed twice weekly in outpatient department. Wounds were closed secondarily if possible or covered with split thickness skin graft in another admission. RESULTS: All the wounds were successfully granulated at the end of vacuum therapy. Mean hospital stay was 7. 5 days. Vacuum dressing was applied for a mean of 20 days. There was reduction in the size of the wound.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundEnterocutaneous fistulae, {{pathological}} {{communications between}} the intestinal lumen and the abdominal skin, can arise as serious complication of gastrointestinal surgery. A current non-surgical treatment for this pathology involves topical application of sub-atmospheric pressure, {{also known as}} <b>vacuum</b> assisted <b>closure</b> (VAC). While this technique appears to be promising, surgeons report {{a number of cases}} in which its application fails to achieve fistula closure. Here, we evaluate the fistula’s physical properties during the <b>vacuum</b> assisted <b>closure</b> process in a computational approach exploring the relevance of intraluminal intestinal pressure. MethodsA mathematical model formulated by differential equations based on tissue elasticity properties and principles of fluid mechanics was created and forcing functions were integrated to mimic intestinal pressure dynamics. A software to solve equations and to fit the model to experimentally obtained data was developed. This enabled simulations of <b>vacuum</b> assisted fistula <b>closure</b> under different intestinal pressure. ResultsThe simulation output indicates conditions, in which fistula closure can or cannot be expected suggesting favoured or impeded healing, respectively. When modifications of intestinal pressure, as observed in fistula accompanying pathologies, are integrated, the outcome of fistula closure changes considerably. Rise of intestinal pressure is associated with delay of fistula closure and temporary fistula radius augmentation, while reduction of intestinal pressure during sub-atmospheric pressure treatment contributes to a faster and direct fistula closure. ConclusionFrom the model predictions, we conclude that administration of intestinal pressure decreasing compounds (e. g. butylscopolamine, glucagon) may improve VAC treatment, while intestinal pressure increasing drugs should be avoided...|$|R

40|$|Background: Complex wounds pose a major {{challenge}} in reconstructive and trauma surgery. Several approaches to increase the healing process have been proposed in the last decades. In this study we study the mechanism of action of the <b>Vacuum</b> Assisted <b>Closure</b> device in diabetic wounds. Methods: Full-thickness wounds were excised in diabetic mice and treated with the VAC device or its isolated components: an occlusive dressing (OD) alone, subathmospheric pressure at 125 mm Hg (Suction), and a polyurethane foam without (Foam) and with (Foamc) downward compression of approximately 125 mm Hg. The last goups were treated with either the complete VAC device (VAC) or with a silicne interface that alows fluid removel (Mepithel-VAC). The effects of the treatment modes on the wound surface were quantified by a two-dimensional immunohistochemical staging system based on vasculature, as defined by blood vessel density (CD 31) and cell proliferation (defined by ki 67 positivity), 7 days post wounding. Finite element modelling was used to predict wound surface deformation under dressing modes and cross sections of in situ fixed tissues were used to measure actual microstrain. Results: The foam-wound interface of the <b>Vacuum</b> Assisted <b>Closure</b> device causes significant wound stains (60 %) causing a deformation of the single cell level leading to a profound upregulation of cell proliferation (4 -fold) and angiogenisis (2. 2 -fold) compared to OD treated wounds. Polyurethane foam exposure itself causes a frather unspecific angiogenic response (Foamc, 2 - fold, Foam, 2. 2 - fold) without changes of the cell proliferation rate of the wound bed. Suction alone without a specific interface {{does not have an}} effect on meassured parameters, showing similar results to untreated wounds. A perforated silicone interface caused a significant lower microdeforamtion of the wound bed correlating to changes of the wound tissues. Conclusion: The <b>Vacuum</b> Assisted <b>Closure</b> device induce significanttissue growth in diabetic wounds. The wound foam interface under suction causes profound macrodeformation that stimulates tissue growth by angiogenesis and cell proliferation. It needs to be taken in consideration that in the clinical setting different wound types may profit from different elements of this suction device...|$|R

Methods A Grade V injury {{was created in the}} right lobe of the liver in a healthy pig. A Pringle maneuver was applied (4. 5 minutes total clamp time) and a <b>vacuum</b> assisted <b>closure</b> device was placed over the injured lobe and connected to suction. The device consisted of a perforated plastic bag placed over the liver, followed by a 15 cm by 15 cm VAC sponge covered with a nonperforated plastic bag. The abdomen was closed temporarily. Blood loss, cardiopulmonary parameters and bladder pressures were measured over a one-hour period. The device was then removed and the animal was euthanized. Results Feasibility of device placement was demonstrated by maintenance of adequate vacuum suction pressures and seal. VAC placement presented no major technical challenges. Successful control of ongoing liver hemorrhage was achieved with the VAC. Total blood loss was 625 ml (20 ml/kg). This corresponds to class II hemorrhagic shock in humans and compares favorably to previously reported estimated blood losses with similar grade liver injuries in the swine model. No post-injury cardiopulmonary compromise or elevated abdominal compartment pressures were encountered, while hepatic parenchymal perfusion was maintained. Conclusion These data demonstrate the feasibility and utility of a perihepatic negative pressure device for the treatment of hemorrhage from severe liver injury in the porcine model. </p...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Postpneumonectomy bronchopleural fistula (PPBPF) is a hard-to-treat {{complication}} {{that may}} develop after pneumonectomy. It follows a persistent course. Although {{there is no}} commonly adopted method, closure of the fistula with flaps is the general principle. The use of the omental flap may provide higher success rates in the treatment.

The demographic characteristics, fistula management strategies, morbidity, and mortalities were retrospectively studied by analysis of operative reports and a digital database. Results: The rate of PPBPF was 7. 4 %. The bronchopleural fistulae could be closed by various treatments in 10 patients; omentopexy constituted the basis of treatment in 8 of them. In the other patients with successful results, resuturing with staplers and <b>vacuum</b> assisted <b>closure</b> were performed during the early period.
