5|$|Ra.One is a 2011 Indian superhero film {{directed}} by Anubhav Sinha, and starring Shah Rukh Khan, Arjun Rampal, Kareena Kapoor, Armaan Verma, Shahana Goswami and Tom Wu in pivotal roles.The script, written by Anubhav Sinha and Kanika Dhillon, originated {{as an idea}} that Anubhav Sinha got {{when he saw a}} television commercial, and which he subsequently expanded. The film follows Shekhar Subramanium (Shah Rukh Khan), a game designer who creates a motion sensor-based game in which the antagonist (Ra.One) is more powerful than the protagonist (G.One). The former escapes from the game's <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> and enters the real world; his aim is to kill Lucifer, the game ID of Shekhar's son and the only player to have challenged Ra.One's power. Relentlessly pursued, the family is forced to bring out G.One from the <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> to defeat Ra.One and protect them.|$|E

40|$|In {{her article}} “Another Time, Another Space: <b>Virtual</b> <b>Worlds,</b> Myths and Imagination” Beatrice Bittarello {{performs}} a reappraisal {{of the issue}} of <b>Virtual</b> <b>Worlds</b> using an interdisciplinary approach. She argues that <b>Virtual</b> <b>Worlds</b> existed before the introduction of the Internet. To back up her argument she outlines a history of literary and visual pre-Internet <b>Virtual</b> <b>Worlds,</b> all of which represent an alternative, mythical, and (often) religious space. She goes on to argue that finding a way of “reaching” <b>Virtual</b> <b>Worlds</b> {{is the key to the}} re-conception of (online) <b>Virtual</b> <b>Worlds</b> today. Many elements of literary <b>Virtual</b> <b>Worlds</b> can thus also be linked to contemporary examples of <b>Virtual</b> <b>Worlds</b> on the Internet. She stresses the importance of visual aspects, even though the imagination and the mythopoeic activity of the players play a key (and integral) role in <b>Virtual</b> <b>Worlds</b> on the Internet...|$|R
40|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> offer great {{potential}} for supporting the collaborative work of geographically distributed teams. However, reports indicate the existence of substantial barriers to the acceptance and use of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> in business settings. In this paper, we explore how individuals' interpretations of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> influence their judgments {{of the value of}} the technology. We conducted a qualitative analysis set in the context of a large computer and software company that was in the process of adopting <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> for distributed collaboration. We identified interpretations of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> that suggest three mental categories: <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> as a medium, <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> as a place, and <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> as an extension of reality. We associated these mental categories with different criteria for assessing the value of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> in a business setting. This study contributes particularly to the acceptance of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> but also more generally to the understanding of technology acceptance by demonstrating that the relative importance of the criteria for assessing a technology varies with potential users' interpretations and mental categorizations...|$|R
40|$|About the book] <b>Virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> are computer-generated {{three-dimensional}} {{worlds in}} which participants adopt digital personae, called avatars, to interact with others. One of the strengths of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> as platforms {{is that they can}} provide engaging and authentic experiences for participants, enabling simulations of different environments, opportunities to roleplay different activities, and facilitating creativity and imagination. This volume focuses on this use of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> for providing experiential learning in particular. Some of the questions the volume aims to answer are: To what extent can the experiences of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> be considered "real"? What types of experiential learning are <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> effective at providing and how can learning design make best use of their potential?; How do different types of learners respond to <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds?</b> How can <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> develop leadership skills? How are courtship rituals and multiracial identity expressed in <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> and what does this reveal about learning? What is the future of experiential learning in <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds...</b>|$|R
5|$|In 3D video games, {{a virtual}} camera system aims at {{controlling}} a camera or {{a set of}} cameras to display a view of a 3D <b>virtual</b> <b>world.</b> Camera systems are used in videogames where their purpose is to show the action at the best possible angle; more generally, they are used in 3D virtual worlds when a third person view is required.|$|E
5|$|Game {{developers}} {{have continued to}} increase support for machinima. Products such as Lionhead Studios' 2005 business simulation game The Movies, Linden Research's <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> Second Life, and Bungie's 2007 first-person shooter Halo 3 encourage the creation of user content by including machinima software tools. Using The Movies, Alex Chan, a French resident with no previous filmmaking experience, took four days to create The French Democracy, a short political film about the 2005 civil unrest in France. Third-party mods like Garry's Mod usually offer the ability to manipulate characters {{and take advantage of}} custom or migrated content, allowing for the creation of works like Counter-Strike For Kids that can be filmed using multiple games.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{companies}} want to retain creative {{control over their}} intellectual properties and are wary of fan-created works, like fan fiction. However, because machinima provides free marketing, they have avoided a response demanding strict copyright enforcement. In 2003, Linden Lab was praised for changing license terms to allow users to retain ownership of works created in its <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> Second Life. Rooster Teeth initially tried to release Red vs. Blue unnoticed by Halos owners because they feared that any communication would force them to end the project. However, Microsoft, Bungie's parent company at the time, contacted the group shortly after episode 2, and allowed them to continue without paying licensing fees.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} {{converting}} {{the film to}} 3-D was put forth during filming, and was implemented in July 2011 due to a revived interest in 3-D films. The process required 2,600 artists to convert 4,400 shots of the film. The sound design involved bridging the real and the <b>virtual</b> <b>world,</b> and the required sound enhancements were achieved by using the Dolby Surround 7.1 system. Incorporating the visual effects began in April 2010, and was preceded by extensive research. 1,200 artists worked for 2½ years to complete the visual effects work. A number of complex procedures were executed, including cubical transformations and {{the design of the}} faceless form of Ra.One.|$|E
5|$|This led Pausch {{to conduct}} a virtual reality class at Carnegie Mellon, to teach others {{and to help them}} realize their {{childhood}} dreams. In the course, 50 students from the university were separated into random teams of four and were each assigned a project relating to building a <b>virtual</b> <b>world.</b> Each group had two weeks to work on the project, and then presented the project to the group. The teams were then randomized again and a new project began. The project then evolved into something that people came to watch, and helped his students realize their potential. Finally, Pausch gave a few words of advice on how others could achieve their childhood dreams, and who his role models were when {{he was trying to do}} so.|$|E

40|$|This Article proposes {{measures}} {{that attempt to}} strike the balance between creation and access. The virtual-world community {{is not likely to}} persevere with the little copyright protection it currently enjoys. Creativity will dwindle and the rich, energetic settings that make <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> so attractive to businesses and entertainers will follow suit. At the same time, because much of the creativity in <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> is derivative in nature, virtual creators are also unlikely to benefit from strong copyright protections. Therefore, current interpretation of copyright law must be revisited and revised before applying it to <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds.</b> Part I details <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> and, in particular, the features that set Second Life apart. Part II asks whether virtual works are copyrightable at all and answers in the affirmative, and then discusses authorship and ownership issues in <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds.</b> Part III discusses what copyright means for <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds,</b> including just how important creativity and continued incentives to create are for the survival of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds.</b> Finally, Part IV argues that, while copyright will be imposed on <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds,</b> broadening the scope of fair use in <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> and imposing a compulsory license for virtual derivatives will encourage creativity and more effectively serve the purpose of copyright law...|$|R
40|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> and 'the Internet' {{in general}} are highly popular in the People's Republic of China. This article will argue, though, that in {{contrast}} to non-Chinese perceptions of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> and the Internet, Chinese users tend to see <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> as wholly separate from their offline existence and identity. Based on the authors research experience with the Chinese Internet, and his years of teaching Chinese students in the 3 D online world Second Life, the paper will demonstrate that Chinese usage frames <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> (and the Internet in general) as spaces, {{in which it is}} permissible to rebel against authority, where users receive validation and approval from their peers, and where they can escape their often stressful and boring lives. The low costs involved, and the high entertainment value of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds,</b> combined with a perception of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> as 'gaming', 'consequence-less' and 'not serious' spaces, contributes to the high attractiveness of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> to young Chinese, which has led to a moral panic in society about the dangers of Internet or gaming 'addiction'. The article will conclude that this framing of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> is so strong in China, in particular among young Chinese, that any attempt to utilize <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> for other purposes, e. g. marketing, education, etc. will have to carefully re-frame and re-situate <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> for Chinese Internet users.
