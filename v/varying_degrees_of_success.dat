The UN's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies. The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo, as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947. The organization's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s, and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping.

40|$|As much as {{socialism}} {{has shaped}} European societies, as little influence socialism {{seems to have}} had in the United States. In 1906 Werner Sombart published his famous book Why is there no socialism in the United States? In one of the most industrialized countries in the world, he was surprised to find only weak and small socialist parties and unions. The debate Sombart started still continues today. The failure of socialism in the United States has caused a scholarly debate about so-called ‘American exceptionalism’. This debate has been the inspiration and starting point for my thesis. Why socialism was successful in some countries and unsuccessful in other countries is a question very suitable for the comparative method. Since socialism {{can be seen as a}} big, even worldwide, ideology that is connected with the process of industrialization, it is interesting to investigate the <b>varying</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> socialism in different countries...|$|R

Instead, the Luftwaffe, with <b>varying</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>success,</b> carried out the strategic bombardment of British industrial cities. The lack of RAF night defences in {{this stage of the}} war enabled the German bombers to inflict extensive damage without suffering the heavy losses of the daylight campaign. It is estimated that the Luftwaffe lost around 500 aircrews during the Blitz in comparison to the Battle of Britain in which it lost around 2,800 killed, 340 wounded, 750 captured. Overall losses were cut by one-third of daylight operations.|$|E

30|$|Biodiesel is {{a mixture}} of monoalkyl esters of fatty acids and is {{obtained}} by the transesterification of oils/fats. The transesterification can be catalyzed by either an acid or alkali or by an enzyme. When an enzyme is used as a catalyst, the reaction can be carried out at a moderate temperature; downstream processing is easier and if the feedstock oil contains high FFA content, enzymatic process seems to be more robust to deal with it [19 – 25].
