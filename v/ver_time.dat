40|$|An {{overview}} of theories related to vibrational energy relaxation (VER) in proteins is presented. VER of a selected mode in cytochrome c is studied by using two theoretical approaches. One {{approach is the}} equilibrium simulation approach with quantum correction factors, {{and the other is}} the reduced model approach, which describes the protein as an ensemble of normal modes interacting through nonlinear coupling elements. Both methods result in similar estimates of the <b>VER</b> <b>time</b> (subpicoseconds) for a CD stretching mode in the protein at room temperature. The theoretical predictions are in accord with previous experimental data. A perspective on directions for the detailed study of time scales and mechanisms of VER in proteins is presented...|$|E

40|$|Fish of the Amazon {{are exposed}} to {{continuous}} changes in dissolved oxygen. They respond to these changes by {{a wide spectrum of}} compensatory and respiratory mechanisms directed towards facilitating both oxygen uptake and oxygen unloading to tissues. Adjustment of erythrocytic levels of organic phosphates is one of these mechanisms and is improved as soon as the animal detects any change in dissolved oxygen. These phosphates are negative modulators of haemoglobin oxygen affinity and changes in their concentration result in changes in oxygen transfer to tissues.

40|$|We first review how to {{determine}} the rate of vibrational energy relaxation (VER) using perturbation theory. We then apply those theoretical results {{to the problem of}} VER of a CD stretching mode in the protein cytochrome c. We model cytochrome c in vacuum as a normal mode system with the lowest-order anharmonic coupling elements. We find that, for the "lifetime" width parameter γ= 3 ∼ 30 cm^- 1, the <b>VER</b> <b>time</b> is 0. 2 ∼ 0. 3 ps, which agrees rather well with the previous classical calculation using the quantum correction factor method, and is consistent with spectroscopic experiments by Romesberg's group. We decompose the VER rate into separate contributions from two modes, and find that the most significant contribution, which depends on the "lifetime" width parameter, comes from those modes most resonant with the CD vibrational mode.

In this paper, we perform classification of time series data using time series shapelets and used Mahalanobis distance measure. The Mahalanobis distance is a descriptive statistic that provides a relative measure of a data point's distance (residual) from a common point. The Mahalanobis distance is used to identify and gauge similarity of an unknown sample set to a known one. It differs from Euclidean distance in that it takes in to account the correlations of the data set and is scale- invariant.

40|$|A new, first-principles {{theory of}} {{vibrational}} energy relaxation (VER) of a solute normal mode infinitely diluted in a monatomic solvent is presented, and numerical applications, including molecular dynamics computer simulation results, are reported. The molecular-level analysis {{begins with a}} physically realistic generalized Langevin equation of motion that reflects the basic physics of the ultra-short time-scale and distance-scale motions characterizing typical chemical processes at liquid densities. The central result of the theory is a rigorous, computationally practical expression for the <b>VER</b> <b>time</b> T 1 {{in terms of the}} friction kernel of the relaxing normal mode evaluated at the liquid-phase frequency of the solute. The friction kernel is obtained as the cosine Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the fluctuating force exerted by the solvent on the solute normal mode given that this coordinate is fixed at its equilibrium value. A Gaussian approximation to the force autocorrelation function allows T 1 to be evaluated from the equilibrium properties of the solution. ^ The theory is implemented for dihalogen and hydrogen-isotope solutes relaxing in monatomic solvents. These studies investigate the temperature, density, and isotope dependencies of T 1. Molecular dynamics simulations are also performed to test the validity of the Gaussian model to the force autocorrelation function. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} and characterize single fluid-mineral interactions we successfully implemented a new hydrothermal laboratory. CO 2 -exposure experiments using separates of rock-forming minerals were performed on a hydrothermal rocking autoclave. The system is equipped with flexible Titanium cells allowing for isobaric sampling. Experiments were run for one week at 80 °C and 20 MPa/ 30 MPa. Rietveld refined XRD data reveal that the initial siderite separate is composed of 69. 6 ± 1. 3 wt% siderite, 26. 7 ± 1. 2 wt% ankerite and 3. 8 ± 0. 8 wt% quartz, respectively. 0 <b>ver</b> <b>time,</b> siderite abundances increase and ankerite abundances correspondingly decrease, while quartz abundances are constant within error. Fluid data show rapid increases for Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Mn 2 + and Fe 2 +. After these rapid increases, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + reveal slight decreases that are followed by subsequent rises to maximum concentrations {{at the end of}} the experiments, while Mn 2 + and Fe 2 + decrease continuously after the initial maxima. SEM micrographs of CO 2 -exposed samples indicate dissolution of ankerite, while siderite and quartz are mainly unaffected. The experiments on the siderite separate clearly show that ankerite is dissolved and siderite is stable. We conclude that siderite is a potential CO 2 trapping phase in iron-bearing reservoirs...|$|E

Despite this recognition, predictive markers of lung dysfunction progression remain elusive (Klings et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 173 : 1264 - 1269, 2006; Platt et al. N Engl J Med 330 : 1639 - 1644, 1994; Caboot et al. Curr Opin Pediatr 20 : 279 - 287, 2008; Field et al. Am J Hematol 83 : 574 - 576, 2008; Shirlo et al. Peadiatr Respir Review 12 : 78 - 82, 2011). This study was designed describe the longitudinal progression and identify specific markers that influence bronchial disease in SCD. Methods: A retrospective, chart review of 89 patients with SCD was conducted. All patients underwent spirometry in conjunction with body plethysmography as part of routine care. Eleven lung function variables were assessed, five of which were selected to establish patterns of normal, obstructive, restrictive, or mixed obstructive-restrictive physiology (Klings et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 173 : 1264 - 1269, 2006; Field et al. Am J Hematol 83 : 574 - 576, 2008). Results: In the unadjusted model, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) % of predicted trended downward with age, while total lung capacity (TLC) % of predicted showed a bimodal distribution and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity corrected for hemoglobin (DLCOcor) % of predicted remained stable. Adjusting for acute chest syndrome (ACS) episodes, medication status, and growth velocity (GV), the final model demonstrated that the downward trend between FEV 1 % of predicted with age was further influenced by the latter two factors. Conclusions: Initial decline in FEV 1 % of predicted is associated with worsening pulmonary dysfunction o <b>ver</b> <b>time.</b> Independent of ACS episodes, the factors most influential on the progression of FEV 1 % predicted include the introduction of medications as well as the promotion of adequate prepubertal growth. Efforts to ensure normal prepubertal GV and treatment with bronchodilators, such as short-acting beta 2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), should be considered at an early age to delay progression of pulmonary dysfunction. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media...|$|E

Exercise is increasingly being recognised as a possible way of promoting health for elderly women, as evidence is emerging of the physical and psychological benefits that accrue from exercise.

Monte Carlo simulation {{could be used}} to solve this problem; however, in highly dependable systems standard simulation takes a <b>ver)</b> long <b>time</b> to estimate system reliability and availability with reasonable accuracy because typically the system failure is a rare event. When all failure and repair time distributions are exponential, importance sampling has been used successfully to reduce simulation run lengths. In this paper, we extend the applicability of importance sampling to non-Markovian models with general failure and repair time distributions. We show that by carefully selecting a heuristic for importance sampling, orders of magnitude reduction in simulation run lengths can be obtained. We study the effect of periodic maintenance on systems with components having increasing and decreasing failure rate. Also, we study the effect of the component's lifetime distribution on the component's redundancy needed to satisfy a particular system reliability goal. For general failure and repair processes, such studies are not possible with any of the conventional methods known from the literature; simulation is the only alternative and importance sampling makes it feasible.

Duration and timing of the nadir was affected by the season (P < 0. 01). Estrus was observed from day 4 after the lowest VER values.

African dust outbreaks were identified over the period 2001 – 2008. Lidar measurements helped to assess thetemporal evolution of the dust layers and subsequent impact on the surface boundary layer. Monthly trends were analyzed, revealing a late spring/summer maximum occurrence of episodes. The most common synoptic meteorological situations causing the transport of the African dusty air masses were also identified o <b>ver</b> the seasons. <b>Time</b> series of particulate matter daily concentrations recorded across Air Quality Network monitoring stations and sampling campaigns were collected and analysed. Our results show the contribution of mineral dust to PM 10 (particulate matter lower than 10 μm, aerodynamic diameter) during African dust outbreaks to be significantly high at rural and urban sites of the Madrid Air Basin, giving rise to exceedances of the PM 10 daily limit value (50 μg/m 3). This result is especially relevant since European directive 2008 / 50 /EC on air quality, takes into account the potential exceedance of the PM 10 daily limit value, due to the transport of natural particles from arid regions.
