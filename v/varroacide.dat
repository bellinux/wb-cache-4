40|$|The {{discovery}} of the honeybee-specific ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor in South Africa in October 1997 raised the spectre of massive honeybee colony losses as has occurred {{in most parts of}} the world where the varroa mite has been found. This was particularly concerning in Africa because of the importance of honeybees in the pollination of indigenous and commercial crops, and because of the numbers of small-scale beekeepers in Africa. The mite has now spread throughout South Africa and is found in almost all honeybee populations, both commercial and wild, and is also now present in most neighbouring countries. Varroa has not left a trail of destruction in South Africa as had been expected and no large scale collapse of the honeybee population occurred, despite the majority of beekeepers deciding not to protect their hives with chemical varroacides. Some colony losses did occur at the front of the varroa spread, and all colonies were found to be deleteriously affected by the mite which developed populations of 50 000 and more in some colonies. Infected colonies were also not as efficient as pollinators as uninfected colonies. Colonies exhibited all the same varroa effects witnessed in other parts of the world, with the exception that the majority of colonies did not die as a result of the infestation. The relative tolerance of African bees to the varroa mite has been confirmed by the long-term monitoring of both wild honeybee populations and commercial stock, and by population dynamic studies of the mites. In both wild and managed honeybee populations varroa appears to have been reduced to the status of an incidental pest. The development of mite tolerance took 3 - 5 years in the Cape honeybee (Apis mellifera capensis) and 6 - 7 years in the Savanna honeybee (Apis mellifera scutellata). The rapid development of mite tolerance in the Cape bee is thought to be due to the well developed removal of varroa-infested brood and the short post-capping period of worker brood. Together these resulted in a very rapid increase in infertile mites in the colony, the collapse of the mite population, and varroa tolerance. Tolerance does not develop as rapidly in Savanna honeybees as the post-capping period in these bees is similar to that of European bees and does not result in as many infertile mites. Nonetheless, varroa tolerance in Savanna bees develops more rapidly than would be the case in European bees because of more effective hygienic removal of varroa-infested brood. In both Cape and Savanna bees, the absence of <b>varroacide</b> applications and a “live-and-let-die” approach to the wild and commercial honeybee populations was crucial to the developed of population-wide varroa tolerance, in contrast to the selective breeding and pesticide treadmill practised {{in most parts of the}} world in an effort to get rid of the varroa mite. Varroa destructor is concluded not to be a serious threat to honeybees and beekeeping in Africa, and efforts should be made to prevent the use of pesticides and techniques that could hinder the development of natural mite tolerance in Africa.

40|$|Cymiazole {{hydrochloride}} is {{the active}} {{component of the}} acaricides Apitol® and Apichem®, which are used as <b>varroacides</b> in beekeeping. Considering that residues of cymiazole hydrochloride were detected in all bee products being used for human nutrition and as alternative medications in human and veterinary medicine, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the ability of this substance to produce genotoxic effects in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The genotoxic effects were studied by sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test in vitro. The results obtained for all doses applied to the cultures (0. 01; 0. 10 and 1 mg/ml) showed very significant increases in frequencies (p< 0. 001) of SCEs in comparison to the negative control, i. e. cymiazole hydrochloride exhibited genotoxic properties...|$|R

40|$|The diploma thesis {{was focused}} on the {{possibility}} to control Varroa destructor in honeybees by using natural <b>varroacides.</b> In the literary section were processed findings about drugs and in the practical part there were described and evaluated the results. During the experiment the effectiveness of formic acid and fluvalinate and effectiveness of oxalic acid and amitraz were compared. Statistical evaluation of results has found that formic acid reached 78, 6 % efficiency, and oxalic acid on average, 93, 8 % efficiency, and this efficiency was equal or statistically insignificantly slightly higher compared to synthetic alternatives. Any negative effects of organic acids on the status and development of colonies were observed. Experiment results are particularly important for the treatment of resistant populations of mites and prevent cumulative acaricides residues in bee products...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{effectiveness}} of two synthetic (Bayvarol and Apivar) and two natural acaricides (Apiguard and ApiLife Var) against Varroa destructor were evaluated with use of infested colonies of Apis mellifera intermissa, housed in Langstroth standard hives. Each acaricide was tested in five hives, and one group of five hives was left untreated as the control. All acaricides significantly reduced the levels of varroa mite infestation on adult honeybees and worker brood, but the efficacy was higher for Apiguard (93 - 97 %) and ApiLife Var (94 - 98 %) compared to Bayvarol (85 - 90 %) and Apivar (82 - 88 %). Overall, the data indicated that essential oils like Apiguard and ApiLife Var can be recommended in the control of V destructor; while synthetic <b>varroacides</b> like Bayvarol and Apivar should be minimized due to increased mite resistance for these products...|$|R
40|$|The present {{studies are}} {{the second part}} of the {{research}} project dedicated to finding the causes for increased winter mortality of honey bee colonies. The aim of this task was to investigate incidents of overwintered colonies′ death with regard to the potential interrelation to the exposure to pesticides. The samples of winter stores of bee bread and sugar food (honey or syrup processed by bees), beeswax and bees collected from apiaries with low and high rates of winter colony mortality were searched for acaricides used to control V. destructor and plant protection pesticides. The presence of acaricides used in apiculture has been detected in the 51 % beeswax samples. The most abundant acaricide was tau-fluvalinate. The stores of bee bread and sugar food had a similar frequency of plant protection pesticide occurrence, ranging between 50 - 60 %, but the number of active substances and their concentrations were substantially lower in sugar food samples. The most prevalent pesticides in pollen were fungicides (carbendazim and boscalid) and insecticides (acetamiprid and thiacloprid). Only a few pesticides were found in the several dead honey bees. The level of pesticide contamination (frequency, concentration, toxicity) of hive products and bees originating from apiaries with both a high and low winter colony survival rates, was similar, which created a similar extent of risk. Although the multiple <b>varroacides</b> and pesticides were present in the hive environment we not found unequivocal links between their residues and high winter colony mortality...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the varroacidal active ingredients oxalic acid dihydrate and hop beta acids on the honeybee Apis mellifera and the pathogens causing Nosemosis, Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae. The conservation of the honeybee has exceptional ecological and economic importance and the treatment of honeybee colonies with veterinary medicines is essential. Colony infestation with the parasitic mite Varroa destructor causes colony collapse within 2 - 3 years unless the colonies are treated regularly. The <b>varroacides</b> oxalic acid and beta acids are highly effective but the effect on the individual honeybee (e. g. pH-value of parts of the intestine and hemolymph) in low sublethal doses has not been studied sufficiently. There is also the assumption that the use of organic acids to combat Varroosis will reduce the prevailance of Nosemosis in honeybee colonies. The tolerance of oxalic acid is described for the dermal and oral application on individually treated honeybees. A dose-response was tested for the following doses: 175 µg, 212, 5 µg, 250 µg, 375 µg and 500 µg/bee after dermal application; 10 µg, 50 µg, 75 µg, 80 µg and 100 µg/bee after oral application. Beta acid were also tested in a dose-depended study: 6 µg, 12, 5 µg, 25 µg, 37, 5 µg and 50 µg/bee after dermal application; 50 µg, 75 µg and 100 µg/bee after oral application. The bee mortality was monitored in intervals of 24, 48 and 72 hours. The dermal application of oxalic acid was well tolerated in a dose up to 212, 5 µg/bee. Increased bee mortality was documented exceeding 25 % in the highest doses. The oral application was not very well tolerated. It resulted in a dose-dependent mortality with a peak at 55 % when applying 100 µg oxalic acid/bee. Beta acids showed low bee toxicity in doses up to 50 µg/bee after dermal application. The oral application of beta acids caused increased bee mortality in all tested dosages. Honeybees kept in the laboratory were treated individually (oral and dermal) with sublethal doses of oxalic acid and beta acids. The pH-value measurement of the intestinal parts (crop, ventriculus, rectum) and hemolymph was conducted in 24 hour intervals. To define the physiological pH-value (“standard”) of the organs, honeybees were analysed subsequently to the sampling of the colony. The physiological pH-values of the honeybee intestinal parts and hemolymph were derived as a standard: crop pH 5. 21, ventriculus pH 6. 55, rectum pH 5. 04, hemolymph pH 6. 72. The treatment with oxalic acid resulted in reduced pH-values of the contents of the crop, the ventriculus (significantly at 48 and 72 hours), the rectum (significantly at 48 and 72 hours) and the hemolymph (significantly at 24 and 72 hours). The treatment with beta acids resulted in increased pH-values of the contents of the crop (significantly at 48 hours), the ventriculus (significantly at 24 hours), the rectum (significantly at 24 hours) and significantly changed pH-values of the hemolymph (at 24 and 72 hours). The infection level of honeybees with Nosema spp. was observed in the laboratory for 35 days after the treatment with oxalic acid and beta acids. In a field experiment nucleus colonies were infected with Nosema spores and treated with the products Oxuvar® (active ingredient: oxalic acid) and HopGuard® (active ingredient: beta acids). The infection level was observed for 25 days by means of individual bee sampling. The application of oxalic acid and beta acids to Nosema diseased bees resulted in a reduced count 8 days post treatment in both test groups compared to the untreated control group. One colony treated with HopGuard® indicated a temporary inhibition of Nosema infection. The individual treatment of honeybees with oxalic acid and beta acids changed the pH-value of the intestinal parts and the hemolymph. The shift towards stronger acidity after oxalic acid treatment confirms that damage to the epithelial tissue and organs is caused by hyperacidity. There is evidence that the growth of the microsporidia Nosema spp. is inhibited; while not preventing the Nosema dispersal in the colony completely it would allow the beekeeper to introduce appropriate remedial measures...|$|R
