ENFO exchanges information among members on enforcement and inspection of suspected IUU (illegal, unreported, unregulated) fishing in the Convention Area and attempts by fishing vessels of members and non-member countries to avoid compliance with the Convention. Using frequent periodic communications among the fisheries enforcement agencies of its members, ENFO coordinates information on patrol schedules and joint ship patrols, personnel exchanges, flag State enforcement and port State inspection actions, and on unauthorized fishing activities conducted by <b>vessels</b> without <b>nationality</b> operating in the Convention Area.|$|R

50|$|The Tsurugi-class (つるぎ型巡視船) is a {{class of}} small patrol vessel of the Japan Coast Guard (JCG).

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} numerous reports of <b>vessels</b> without <b>nationality</b> fishing in contravention of international {{conservation and management}} measures. During the summer of 1998, for example, four vessels registered to Sierra Leone were sighted fishing {{on the high seas}} in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) regulatory area. These vessels were known throughout the international community to be flying 2 ̆ 2 flags of convenience 2 ̆ 2 [...] having only the most tenuous link to their flag state. Bowing to direct diplomatic pressure, Sierra Leone refuted the vessels 2 ̆ 7 registration, rendering them stateless and, therefore, subject to the jurisdiction of any state that approached them on the high seas. Such situations are becoming more common. The apparent increase in vessels fishing on the high seas without the protection of a flag state likely has several causes. Many states, like Sierra Leone, known to grant flags of convenience, have yielded to direct diplomatic pressure and purged their registries of illegitimate vessels. Others have begun voluntarily applying the principles underlying the 1995 United Nations Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and the 1993 Food and Agriculture Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas. Unfortunately, neither the international community nor the United States has effective tools at its disposal to deal with stateless vessels fishing illegally on the high seas. This Article reviews the current status of international and United States domestic law applicable to <b>vessels</b> without <b>nationality</b> seen fishing the high seas in contravention of international conservation and management measures. The discussion begins in Part II with a survey of the international regime of the high seas, and reviews the importance of the exclusivity rule of flag state jurisdiction on the high seas and exceptions therein, including stateless vessels and vessels assimilated to stateless status. Part III is a brief analysis of international tools and how they interact in the current international legal regime of the high seas. Part IV outlines the High Seas Fishing Compliance Act of 1995 as it is currently written, and suggests a legislative change that would allow the United States to enforce international and multilateral agreements against stateless vessels and those assimilated to stateless status seen fishing on the high seas...|$|R

50|$|The U.S. {{government}} {{launched an}} extensive {{investigation into the}} disappearance of the crew of the Deering. Five departments of the government - Commerce, Treasury, Justice, Navy, and State - looked into the case. Herbert Hoover, then Secretary of Commerce, was intrigued by the fact that several other <b>vessels</b> of various <b>nationalities</b> - most notably the sulfur freighter Hewitt - had also disappeared in roughly the same area. Though most of these vessels were later revealed to have been sailing in the vicinity of a series of particularly vicious hurricanes, the Hewitt and Deering were proven to have been sailing away from the area of the storm at the time. Hoover's assistant, Lawrence Ritchey, was placed in charge of the investigation. Ritchey tried to chart what happened to the vessel between its last sighting at Cape Lookout and its running aground at Diamond Shoals by reading the log books of the Coast Guard lightships stationed at those places.|$|R

40|$|During the February 1820 Term, the Supreme Court of the United States decided four {{significant}} piracy cases, {{beginning with}} United States v. Klintock. Political, economic, and social pressures enhanced {{the problem of}} piracy affecting {{the interests of the}} United States. Responding to the criticism of his decision in United States v. Palmer and the passage of the Act of 1819 state Congressional intent for defining piracy by the “law of nations,” Marshall authored the decision in Klintock distinguishing Palmer and, upon reconsideration, interpreting the Act of 1790 to include general piracy as defined by the “law of nations. ” With a broader interpretation, federal courts had the jurisdiction to consider cases of general piracy regardless of the character of the <b>vessel</b> or <b>nationality</b> of the offender if the vessel operated under the flag of an unacknowledged foreign entity and if an American interest was at issue. While serving as the foundation for the final three piracy cases to endure broad enforcement authority over piracy, the story of Klintock did not end with the decision. An internal controversy over missing evidence in the case due to an alleged conspiracy implicated other parties in the piracy and demonstrated the internal policies and political considerations Monroe administration {{in the aftermath of the}} piracy cases. Following an investigation, internal correspondence, lobbying efforts on behalf of Ralph Clintock, and other outside pressures, the Monroe administration was not convinced that Clintock was innocent, but did find that the totality of the circumstances favored a pardon for Clintock...|$|R

Although undefeated, the French retreated.
