5|$|The race {{received}} {{a significant amount}} of negative media coverage over the two equine fatalities, which were more publicly noticeable than in prior Nationals due to two fences being bypassed for the first time. Those watching the race on television were given clear views of the tarpaulin-covered body of Ornais at the fourth fence, and an aerial shot at Becher's showed <b>veterinary</b> <b>staff</b> attending to the fatally-injured Dooneys Gate, while the remaining runners diverted around them.|$|E
5|$|Ornais and Dooneys Gate both {{suffered}} fatal {{falls on}} the first circuit. Ornais incurred a cervical fracture at the fourth fence (a plain 4ft 10-inch obstacle) and Dooneys Gate fractured his thoracolumbar at fence six (the 5ft Becher's Brook). Aintree had made significant modifications to its National Course in recent years, including improving veterinary facilities and reducing the severity of some fences, but another notable change was highlighted in this race – that the course has been widened to allow more fences to be bypassed if necessary. As the remaining contenders on the second circuit approached the 20th fence, arrowed signposts and marshals waving chequered flags signalled them to bypass on the outside as Ornais' body was covered by a tarpaulin on the landing side. Two jumps later and they were again diverted, this time around the famous Becher's Brook, where <b>veterinary</b> <b>staff</b> attended to Dooneys Gate. This {{was the first time}} since the modern course was finalised in the 1880s that only 28 fences were jumped.|$|E

40|$|This Learning and Teaching Guide {{has been}} {{produced}} to assist <b>veterinary</b> teaching <b>staff</b> in developing curricula that enhance communication and life skills. The Guide {{is a result}} of an Australian Learning and Teaching Council Collaborative Grant involving <b>veterinary</b> teaching <b>staff</b> from Murdoch University, The University of Queensland and The University of Sydney. The project team aimed to improve the development and assessment of student competencies in professional communication and life skills. The development of communication skills during the undergraduate veterinary curriculum is an essential component of preparing graduates for veterinary practice and specifically responds to feedback from both veterinary registering boards and employers of veterinary graduates. Australian educators also listed ‘effective and empathic communication’ and ‘capacity for self-management and self-knowledge’ as desired graduate attributes within the veterinary professional life skill category (Collins & Taylor 2002) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with brucellosis in farmers, <b>veterinary</b> technical <b>staff</b> and other volunteers in Peninsular Malaysia using the One Health concept. A cross sectional study design was employed to sample a population of farmers and <b>Veterinary</b> technical <b>staff</b> on a volunteer basis. The Brucella Coombs test was used to elucidate the seroprevalence of brucellosis in the sampled population and the associated factors and predictors for brucellosis. The seroprevalence of brucellosis among farmers and non-farmers (<b>veterinary</b> technical <b>staff</b> and others) of 446 people studied was 1. 35 % (95 % CI= 0. 28 - 2. 42). Occupation, age and drinking unpasteurized milk were significant risk factors for brucellosis using multivariate logistic regression at 90 % confidence level. The odds of having brucellosis increased by 7. 19 times in farmers compared to non-farmers (90 % CI= 1. 16, 44. 71), it increased 7. 16 times in individuals 40 years and below compared with those above 40 years old (90 % CI= 1. 16, 44. 41) and 4. 45 times among those who drink unpasteurized milk compared to those who do not (90 % CI= 1. 03, 19. 15). This study highlights the current state of human brucellosis in Malaysia among those groups that are occupationally at risk. A nationwide health education of the occupationally exposed population especially farmers may decrease the incidence of the infection and support the on-going eradication efforts of brucellosis in Malaysia...|$|R

30|$|In {{pastoral}} communities, {{animals that}} get sick are often treated by themselves due to unavailability of livestock disease professional and para-professionals {{that can take}} charge in disease diagnosis, treatment and other disease management. Other factors include high treatment cost linked to calls of veterinary doctors and buying of drugs, keeping large number of animals just for prestige, nomadic lifestyle and insufficient knowledge on best ways to control diseases. Apart from livestock experts being few, nomadic lifestyle contributes by far for the limited access to veterinary services that would provide service on time. Pastoralists have limited knowledge about dosage and routes for drug administration. Free market economy for veterinary pharmaceutical in Tanzania contributes greatly to self-treatment of animals by and mishandling of drugs. Easy access to drugs and self-treatment procedures have great impact on control of livestock diseases especially during outbreaks as pastoralists will report after so many trials, while the disease is progressing to spread. The use of trained Community Animal Health Workers (CAHWs) as an important alternative animal to animal health delivery channel in the country’s marginal areas where there are few professional veterinary practitioners will help to reduce the problems (Allport et al. 2005; Swai and Masaaza 2012). In the rural settings health delivery systems are hampered by many factors including remoteness, poor infrastructure, inadequate transport, lack of qualified <b>veterinary</b> <b>staffs</b> and insufficient funds to support surveillance operations and buy reagents and drugs (Swai and Schoonman 2012). Therefore, the use of CAHWs {{could be a good}} link to the veterinary professionals and the livestock disease control units for providing information to the livestock keepers and to the veterinary experts.|$|R

Feed supplementation and health care significantly improved performance within and between management systems, including mean weight gain per year for does; confined stall-feeding is the management system of choice, although Scavanging and confined stall-feeding systems could be combinely practiced.

40|$|To {{determine}} the epidemiologic and clinical {{features of a}} 2008 outbreak of Hendra virus infection in a veterinary clinic in Australia, we investigated the equine case-series. Four of 5 infected horses died, as did 1 of 2 infected staff members. Clinical manifestation in horses was predominantly neurologic. Preclinical transmission appears likely. Hendra virus (HeV) was first identified in 1994 after a fatal respiratory disease occurred in horses and humans in Australia (1, 2). Fruit bats (Pteropus spp.) are the natural reservoir (3). Eleven bat-to-horse spillovers have now been identified, with 4 resulting in horse-to-human transmission. Infection in horses typically has been characterized by acute febrile illness with rapid, progressive respiratory system compromise and high case-fatality rates (2, 4 – 8). A high case-fatality rate was again {{a feature of the}} 2008 outbreak, which we describe here: 4 of 5 infected horses died, as did 1 of 2 infected <b>veterinary</b> clinic <b>staff.</b> In contrast to previously reported cases, the clinical features of the infected animals and humans reflected primarily central nervous system involvement.
