5|$|Development of {{the game}} officially began in January 2013. Ubisoft Montreal, the {{developer}} of Patriots, handled the game's development, with Ubisoft's offices in Barcelona, Toronto, Kiev, Shanghai and Chengdu providing assistance. The game was originally called Rainbow Six Unbreakable, a title that reflected not only the game's destruction mechanic but also the mindset of the development team, who had to deliver a game that was once stuck in development hell. According to Alexandre Remy, the brand director, the team was confident in their new vision for the game but <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> when they revealed it, realizing the change of direction would likely disappoint some fans.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{expedition}} ended in failure {{the members of}} the Uitvoerend Bewind became <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> {{in the days before the}} Battle of Bergen. The Agent for Foreign Affairs, Van der Goes who had been in favor of distancing the Republic from the French, chose this inopportune moment to secretly approach the King of Prussia as a mediator, with a scheme in which the Hereditary Prince was to become a kind of constitutional monarch in a constitution on the model of the American Constitution. The Republic would revert to its traditional neutrality, while Britain would occupy North Holland, and France Zeeland. The overture was rejected, and it caused a lot of embarrassment in the relations with the French Directoire. At this time Napoleon Bonaparte performed his coup of 18 Brumaire, establishing the French Consulate. The Franco-Batavian relations now entered a whole new era.|$|E
5|$|NASA takes both Homer and Barney to Cape Canaveral for training. As {{only one}} of them can go into space, they soon find {{themselves}} in competition. Under NASA's alcohol ban, the newly sober Barney quickly develops superior skills and is selected to fly with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Race Banyon. However, when Barney toasts his victory with non-alcoholic champagne, he inexplicably reverts to his normal alcoholic self and escapes, stealing a jetpack and crashing into a nearby pillow factory. Homer wins by default and is selected for space flight, but after watching an episode of Itchy and Scratchy involving space exploration, he becomes <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> about going. Just as they prepare to take off in the Corvair space shuttle, Homer runs away. He talks with Marge on the phone, and she says that he ought {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity. He agrees, and the launch, which is also a Nielsen ratings smash, proceeds.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} to understanding nervous system development is to establish how a fairly limited number of axon guidance cues can set up the patterning of <b>very</b> complex <b>nervous</b> systems. Most of the recent insights relevant to guidance mechanisms have come from cell biologists focusing on processes and molecular machinery controlling the guidance responses in the growth cone...|$|R
50|$|Having {{worked on}} the game since its title was changed, Naora was <b>very</b> excited and <b>nervous</b> {{creating}} a trailer for the game to appear on copies of Final Fantasy Type-0 HD.|$|R
25|$|Grout {{played his}} first Test on home soil on 5 December 1958, {{in front of}} a home-town crowd at Brisbane; he was <b>very</b> <b>nervous.</b> Early in the match, he caught Tom Graveney off the bowling of Davidson, which was to be the first of twenty wickets he picked up for the series, equalling Don Tallon's record in Ashes series. Australia {{went on to win the}} series 4-0.|$|E
25|$|Barlow and Chambers were {{observed}} alighting {{from the same}} taxi at Bayan Lepas International Airport on 9 November 1983. Barlow carried the maroon suitcase and entered the airport. He bypassed the luggage scanning area and approached the check-in desk. Chambers, carrying Barlow's bags, paid the taxi, entered the airport and passed through the luggage scanning area, and joined Barlow at the check-in desk. They were detained by police, as Barlow was seen to be <b>very</b> <b>nervous.</b>|$|E
25|$|Initial {{plans were}} that Barlow and Chambers conceal the drugs by {{inserting}} some packages into their anuses and swallowing the rest. Barlow {{refused to do}} either, the former for reasons of distaste, the latter due to health concerns with that method. Chambers relented and placed the several packages of drugs, which were within plastic carry bags and wrapped in newspaper, into a newly purchased maroon suitcase. Barlow had become <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> after {{the collection of the}} drugs.|$|E

60|$|TRUE!--nervous--very, <b>very</b> dreadfully <b>nervous</b> I {{had been}} and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had {{sharpened}} my senses--not destroyed--not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily--how calmly I {{can tell you the}} whole story.|$|R
25|$|His debut proved unsuccessful. Joining Donald Bradman at the crease, Stanford was run {{out without}} scoring, with a team-mate later {{explaining}} that Stanford had been <b>very</b> <b>nervous.</b> He did not bat again and was {{dropped from the}} team for the next match. Having begun {{a career in the}} State Bank of South Australia, Stanford's cricketing career was put on hold when he was transferred out of Adelaide to Waikerie and then Tailem Bend. As a result, Stanford would not play first-class cricket again before the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} {{known about the}} social {{organization}} and behavior of this species, {{in part due to}} its erratic movements and also because individuals are widely characterized as <b>very</b> <b>nervous,</b> always on the move (Shelly et al. 2008), very shy, ‘quick on the wing’ (MacGillivray 1910) and very timid (Burgess 1946; eds Higgins et al. 2001). Birds are often seen singly and in pairs however early Australian records note movements of pied honeyeaters in “constant” flocks, “flying against the wind ……in flocks at times of fifty or more” (Carter 1902, p.84) and in larger flocks of several hundred (Higgins et al. 2001).|$|E
25|$|As {{reported}} by Wright's apprentices at Taliesin, Kaufmann Sr. was in Milwaukee on September 22, {{nine months after}} their initial meeting, and called Wright at home early Sunday morning to surprise him {{with the news that}} he would be visiting Wright that day, before lunch. He could not wait to see Wright's plans. Wright had told Kaufmann in earlier communication that he had been working on the plans, but had not actually drawn anything. After breakfast that morning, amid a group of <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> apprentices, Wright calmly drew the plans in the two hours in which it took Kaufmann to drive to Taliesin.|$|E

25|$|His {{appearance}} at the big Antimafia trials {{and the end of}} the 1960s made many of the island’s establishment <b>very</b> <b>nervous.</b> When showing up in court, Genco Russo presented petitions from prominent politicians, priests, bankers, doctors, lawyers and businessman who declared to testify on his behalf. His lawyer threatened to publish telegrams from 37 Christian Democratic deputies – one a cabinet minister – thanking Genco Russo for helping them to get elected. Minister and prominent DC politician Bernardo Mattarella denied that he had been sent one. Genco Russo was sentenced to five years confinement by the Court of Caltanissetta, and sent to Lovere, near Bergamo.|$|E
25|$|To sweeten {{the deal}} for a <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> sponsor, Paley {{also agreed to}} make up the {{difference}} to American Tobacco if Benny's Hooper rating (the radio version of today's Nielsen ratings) on CBS fell to a certain level below his best NBC Hooper rating. Benny's CBS debut on January 2, 1949 bested his top NBC rating by several points while also pumping up the ratings of the show that followed, Amos 'n' Andy. NBC, with its smash Sunday night lineup now broken up, offered lucrative new deals to two of those Sunday night hits, The Fred Allen Show and The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show. Benny's bandleader and his singing actress wife now starred in their own hit sitcom, meaning Harris was featured on shows for two different networks.|$|E
25|$|Jodie Whittaker {{was cast}} as Beth Latimer, {{the mother of}} the murdered boy. She was hired after Buchan and McClure joined the series. Her {{audition}} consisted of several scenes from the first episode. Whittaker admitted that she was <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> about accepting a role in a series whose scripts had not yet been completed. Chris Chibnall, however, told her that none of the actors would know who the murderer was (not even the actor who played the killer) until the last possible moment. She found that highly appealing, for it raised the anxiety level in the actors and reduced each actor's willingness to trust the other characters. She was also impressed by the heart-breaking way the first episode was written, and how many interesting characters there were in the series.|$|E

50|$|The {{public outcry}} which {{followed}} the attack had {{been accompanied by}} public condemnation from the President and Prime Minister, both of whom called for the perpetrators to be sought and convicted: this was totally unexpected by Lukeš.

5000|$|In April 1943 Newfoundland repatriated some Allied {{servicemen}} from Lisbon to Avonmouth, England. Among {{them was}} Flight Lieutenant John F. Leeming RAF, {{who had been}} captured with Air Marshal Owen Tudor Boyd (as his Aide-de-Camp) in 1940. His escape plan from Vincigliata PG 12 prisoner of war camp in Italy was by cleverly faking a <b>very</b> bad <b>nervous</b> breakdown case. He succeeded so well that the international medical board, with Swiss and Italian doctors, unhesitatingly accepted his case. As he describes in his book: ...|$|R
500|$|Adams' first live {{performance}} of [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] {{was at the}} 80th Academy Awards ceremony in 2008. Performing at approximately 6:01 pm local time, Adams was reportedly <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> during and after her performance, revealing to The Huffington Post, [...] "I don't know how I did that. It's {{the thing that was}} the most terrifying that I've ever done, and the thing I'm most proud of in my career." [...] Subsequently, Adams told Vulture.com that she would likely perform at the Academy Awards again [...] "As long as [...] wasn't doing it by self".|$|E
500|$|Serena and Azarenka met {{in their}} careers' 46th and seventh career finals respectively, with Serena {{appearing}} in her third consecutive final at the event, having won {{on the last}} two occasions. Azarenka dominated the final match, as Serena was playing while nursing a leg injury. Azarenka won the match, securing third title of her career. Azarenka stated that she was <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> in {{the final game of}} the match and described her win as [...] "the biggest moment in [...] career". Serena mentioned that it was difficult for her to move to the left, but she still played with maximum effort.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack was {{the fourth}} of the series to be {{composed}} by John Barry. He tried to incorporate the [...] "elegance of the Oriental sound" [...] with Japanese music-inspired tracks. The theme song, [...] "You Only Live Twice", was composed by Barry and lyricist Leslie Bricusse and sung by Nancy Sinatra after her father Frank Sinatra passed on the opportunity. Nancy Sinatra {{was reported to be}} <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> while recording— first she wanted to leave the studio; then she claimed to sometimes [...] "sound like Minnie Mouse". Barry declared that the final song uses 25 different takes. British singer Julie Rogers recorded an alternative song for the titles, but this was not used.|$|E
50|$|Among the girls, Keka {{was shown}} the green card. Among the two {{remaining}} competitors, Alka said that Vineeta had a powerful voice but {{it was evident that}} she was <b>very</b> tense and <b>nervous,</b> and that Priyani's throw needs to be improved. Vineeta was shown the green card, and Priyani was eliminated.|$|R
2500|$|Johannes Carl Andersen {{notes that}} at least some of the Canterbury Colonists' {{criticism}} of Campbell appears to have been [...] warranted: [...] "The Colonel wrote in a <b>very</b> minute, <b>nervous</b> hand and his letters were extraordinarily diffuse, even as compared with other letters in those days of formal long-drawn-out and often tedious official correspondence... He located his office at Akaroa (some 50 miles by bush track from the main settlement at Christchurch) and sometimes published instructions to Canterbury stock-owners in the Wellington Spectator" [...] (i.e. in the New Zealand Spectator and Cook's Strait Guardian, a Wellington publication).|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Gashleigh was <b>very</b> red and <b>nervous,</b> and paced, {{or rather}} {{squeezed}} round the table (it {{was as much}} as she could do). The chairs could not be put any closer than they were. It was impossible, unless the convive sat as a centre-piece in the middle, to put another guest at that table.|$|R
500|$|Peggy and Frank {{were married}} {{on-screen}} on 1 April 1999. A [...] "hen night" [...] was thrown for Windsor with the show's make-up team, and the BBC threw a [...] "massive" [...] {{party in the}} show's Albert Square to celebrate the event. Actors Windsor and Reid joined fellow stars, celebrities and TV executives for a celebration on the programme's set in Elstree, Hertfordshire. Windsor admitted {{she had been so}} nervous before filming the wedding she was sick on set. She commented, [...] "I broke out in spots and threw up in the vestry. I was <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> – we were both <b>very</b> <b>nervous.</b> The day you stop getting nervous you can hold your hands up. It shows you care." [...] The soap wedding was filmed in Harrow, North West London in February 1999. A BBC spokesman commented: [...] "It {{is one of the best}} weddings Walford has ever seen but it is not problem free. There are a lot of people who do not want to see Frank and Peggy married – Grant being one of them – and it remains to be seen whether they will get through the day without a major upset. And as if the wedding is not gripping enough, there are certainly shocking revelations back at the Vic." [...] In the eventual episode, it was actually Grant Mitchell who persuaded his mother to marry Frank – with whom he had been feuding following his accidental killing of wife Tiffany – after Peggy was having second thoughts, thinking that Frank was only marrying her out of pity. Nearly 20 million viewers watched Peggy and Frank marry.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} night, Jerry, Elaine, and George {{have dinner}} with Elaine's father, writer Alton Benes. While preparing for the dinner, George arrives at Jerry's apartment with the song [...] "Master of the House" [...] from the musical Les Misérables stuck in his head. George and Jerry are both <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> to meet Alton because {{he is such a}} famous author. When they are about to leave, Jerry puts on his new jacket. George is very impressed and attempts to get Jerry to reveal its cost. Kramer enters the apartment and asks for two minutes' help guarding his illegally parked car as he carries down some doves that he is looking after for a magician friend. However, they refuse to help because he often underestimates how long things take to do.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{signed for}} Hibernian as a {{professional}} in 2002 and made his debut as a substitute in a 3–1 win against Aberdeen on 3 May 2003. Brown, aged 17, said that [...] "I was <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> when I went on but that soon disappeared when I got involved in the game." [...] He helped set up all three of Hibs goals in that match. Brown made his first starting appearance the following week, in a 1–0 win against Motherwell. Brown then started in Hibs' remaining two matches {{of the season and}} scored in both, a double in a 2–1 win against Livingston and in a 3–2 defeat to Partick Thistle. Brown was part of a [...] "Golden Generation" [...] for Hibs, also including players like Kevin Thomson, Garry O'Connor, Derek Riordan, Steven Whittaker and Steven Fletcher, who all progressed through their youth team at around the same time.|$|E
