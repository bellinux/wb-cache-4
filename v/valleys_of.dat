5|$|Fumarolic {{activity}} affects {{surrounding rocks}} and pyroclastics. Carbonates, opal, and white covers of possibly aluminum sulfate and calcium sulfate have been formed.

William Herbert made a claim over part of the Orroral Valley at some point between 1826 and 1836, while during the 1830s Garrett Cotter {{inhabited}} what would later be named the Cotter River Valley, in his honour. From the late 1830s, the Boboyan Homestead and station were established. Gudgenby was settled in the early 1840s and the Gudgenby Homestead was erected around this time. By 1848 most of the major <b>valleys</b> <b>of</b> the Namadgi area had been settled.|$|E

5|$|Several {{parallel}} {{ranges of}} hills dominate {{the interior of}} the Catlins, separated by the <b>valleys</b> <b>of</b> the Owaka, Catlins and Tahakopa Rivers, which all drain southeastwards into the Pacific Ocean. The most notable of these ranges is the Maclennan Range. Between them, these hills are often simply referred to as the Catlins Ranges. Their northwestern slopes are drained by several tributaries of the Clutha and Mataura Rivers, most notably the Mokoreta River, which flows mainly westwards, reaching the Mataura close to the town of Wyndham.|$|E
5|$|The Marcellus {{is easily}} eroded, {{and is also}} found {{underlying}} low areas between some Appalachian ridges, forming linear <b>valleys</b> <b>of</b> moderate relief. These bedrock surfaces are typically covered with colluvium from erosion of stratigraphically higher and more erosion-resistant strata that form the surrounding higher ground. The soils formed from the Marcellus and the overlying Hamilton shales are deep, free of stones, and well suited for agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The Northwest Power and Conservation Council {{divides the}} Kootenay River {{watershed}} into six biomes: aquatic (rivers and lakes), riparian zones, wetlands, grassland/shrubs, moderately wet forest, and dry forest. The forested zones extend through the alpine and subalpine {{reaches of the}} watershed, while grasslands dominate the low terraces and plateaus surrounding the river, especially in the Lake Koocanusa area and the Montana-Idaho portion of the watershed. In the Canada portion of the watershed, an alpine meadow ecozone occupies most of the high ridges and <b>valleys</b> <b>of</b> the mountains.|$|E

5|$|The Rhondda Valley {{is located}} in the upland, or Blaenau, area of Glamorgan. The {{landscape}} of the Rhondda was formed by glacial action during the last ice age, as slow moving glaciers gouged out the deep valleys that exist today. With the retreat of the ice sheet, around 8000BC, the valleys were further modified by stream and river action. This left the two river <b>valleys</b> <b>of</b> the Rhondda with narrow, steep sided slopes which would dictate the layout of settlements from early to modern times.|$|E
5|$|The cuisine of Switzerland is multifaceted. While some {{dishes such as}} fondue, raclette or rösti are omnipresent {{through the}} country, each region {{developed}} its own gastronomy according to the differences of climate and languages. Traditional Swiss cuisine uses ingredients {{similar to those in}} other European countries, as well as unique dairy products and cheeses such as Gruyère or Emmental, produced in the <b>valleys</b> <b>of</b> Gruyères and Emmental. The number of fine-dining establishments is high, particularly in western Switzerland.|$|E
