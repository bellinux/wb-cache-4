40|$|Apart {{from the}} {{fundamental}} {{interest in a}} weak characterization of quadratic forms the possibility to extend quadratic forms defined on <b>subspaces</b> of a <b>vector</b> space $(P,K) $ to a common form on P is helpfull in the representation of higher dimensional geometries {{as well as in}} characterizing quadrics by their plane sections. In the case that all <b>vector</b> <b>subspaces</b> endowed with a quadratic form are three-dimensional, there are extension theorems, first under additional conditions by J. Tits [1], H. -J. Kroll [4], K. J. Dienst, H. Mäurer [2], E. M. Schröder [7], H. Maürer [6] and finally in the most general form by E. M. Schröder [8], [10]. Apparently there are only two papers investigating under which conditions quadratic forms defined on two-dimensional <b>vector</b> <b>subspaces</b> posess a common extension. In [9], (8. 7) E. M. Schröder showed how to extend quadratic forms defined on two-dimensional <b>vector</b> <b>subspaces</b> of a given three-dimensional vector space by employing the hexagram-condition. In [5] euclidean spaces of arbitrary dimension are described by an axiom system relating only to incidence and congruence. Taking euclidean planes for granted, it is required that every plane of the space is an euclidean plane. By a further axiom all planes are made compatible. Based on the method of [4] it is possible to construct a quadratic form which describes the congruence relation. For this construction H. Karzel gave a direct proof in [3]. Implicitly in his proof in the case of characteristic $≠ 2 $ anisotropic symmetric bilinear forms are extended from two-dimensional <b>vector</b> <b>subspaces</b> to the <b>vector</b> space containing them. In this paper we prove an extension theorem for symmetric bilinear forms defined on two-dimensional <b>vector</b> <b>subspaces.</b> In the case of characteristic 2 our proof is not valid for quadratic forms but only for bilinear forms with sufficiently many anisotropic vectors. On the other side {{in the case of a}} characteristic $≠ 2 $ Satz (3. 2) in [8] is a direct conclusion of our theorem. Gratefully at the end of section 1 we repeat a comment of this paper's referee, that our theorem might be deduced from a general representation theorem for polarities. But in section 2 the extension will be constructed directly...|$|R

2500|$|A {{covariant}} derivative in {{differential geometry}} is a linear differential operator which takes the directional derivative of {{a section of}} a vector bundle in a covariant manner. [...] It also allows one to formulate a notion of a parallel section of a bundle {{in the direction of}} a vector: a section s is parallel along a vector X if ∇X's = 0. [...] So a covariant derivative provides at least two things: a differential operator, and a notion of what it means to be parallel in each direction. [...] An Ehresmann connection drops the differential operator completely and defines a connection axiomatically in terms of the sections parallel in each direction [...] [...] Specifically, an Ehresmann connection singles out a <b>vector</b> <b>subspace</b> of each tangent space to the total space of the fiber bundle, called the horizontal space. [...] A section s is then horizontal (i.e., parallel) in the direction X if ds(X) lies in a horizontal space.
