5|$|As in the {{previous}} years, there were two classes of cyclists, the coureurs de <b>vitesse</b> and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant {{that they had to}} finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance. The coureurs de <b>vitesse</b> could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.|$|E
5|$|A {{day after}} the draw against <b>Vitesse,</b> Ronald Koeman {{announced}} he would end his tenure as manager of Feyenoord {{at the end of}} the 2013–14 season. On 4 February the team beat Roda JC away 2–1. Immers and Armenteros scored to take a two-goal lead at half time, Roda got on the board near the end of the game. The win moved Feyenoord to two points behind <b>Vitesse.</b> The following Saturday Feyenoord played N.E.C. at home. The visitors took an early lead, before Immers and Pellè gave Feyenoord a one-goal advantage at half time. An additional goal by Pellè and two scores from Boëtius led to a 5–1 win that led Feyenoord to third place in the league table. On 16 February the club played away at NAC Breda. The game ended in a 1–1 draw; Janmaat scored the lone Feyenoord goal in the first half before NAC equalized from a penalty kick. Feyenoord played their last February match on the 23rd away against FC Twente. They created a two-goal lead halfway in the second half from goals by Pellè and Boëtius before Twente scored twice to lead to a 2–2 draw. The last goal came after 5 minutes of stoppage time and was controversial as it was even considered to be offside by Twente player Castaignos. The club ended February fourth in the league table.|$|E
5|$|The spell in Turkey, however, {{proved to}} be an unhappy time for Babangida and the Ankara side chose no to pursue their {{interest}} in the player once the loan deal expired. Looking for a move away from Netherlands, Babangida came close to signing with AJ Auxerre, but received a last-minute call from Ronald Koeman and agreed to join him at <b>Vitesse</b> instead. Another loan move followed. First team player under Koeman, Babangida subsequently lost his place in the starting line-up, when Ronald Koeman left for Ajax and was replaced by Edward Sturing.|$|E
50|$|In the June 2014 offering, <b>Vitesse's</b> largest shareholder, Raging Capital Management LLC, {{purchased}} {{an additional}} 1.6 million shares. This raised Raging Capital's total position to 14.3 million shares, or approximately 25% of <b>Vitesse's</b> outstanding shares.|$|R

5|$|There {{were two}} {{categories}} of riders, the coureurs de <b>vitesse</b> and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. The riders in the first category were allowed to change bicycles, which could be an advantage in the mountains, where they could use a bicycle with lower gears. The riders in the machines poinçonnées category {{had to use the}} same bicycle in the entire race, and to verify this, their bicycles were marked.|$|E
5|$|A second-place {{finish in}} the 2001–02 FA Premier League {{entitled}} Liverpool {{to participate in the}} Champions League for a second successive season, but they only finished third in their group and were eliminated from the competition. The third-place finish meant they entered the 2002–03 UEFA Cup. Liverpool beat Dutch team <b>Vitesse</b> Arnhem and Auxerre to set up an all-British tie with Scottish team Celtic. A 1–1 draw in the first leg meant Liverpool would progress to the semi-finals if they did not concede a goal in the second leg at Anfield. However, Celtic scored before half-time and again in the second half to win 3–1 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|As in 1905, the cyclists {{were divided}} in two categories, the coureurs de <b>vitesse</b> and the coureurs sur {{machines}} poinçonnées, where the riders {{in the first}} category were allowed to change bicycles, which could be an advantage in the mountains, where they could use a bicycle with lower gears. In 1905, sponsors {{had not been so}} enthusiastic about entering their cyclists in this category, but in 1906 they had learned that it had a commercial advantage to have cyclists starting in the poinçonnées category, because the average French citizen could identify more with them. In 1906, {{more than half of the}} cyclists started in the poinçonnées category, including Lucien Petit-Breton, one of the pre-favourites.|$|E
50|$|Born in Rotterdam, Bosz joined <b>Vitesse's</b> youth setup in 2011. He was {{promoted}} to the main squad in the 2014 summer by manager (and father) Peter Bosz.|$|R
50|$|Born in Emmerich am Rhein, Gosens {{appeared}} {{for local}} clubs before joining <b>Vitesse's</b> youth setup on 4 July 2012. On 13 August 2013 he signed his first professional {{deal with the}} club.|$|R
50|$|Born in Qamishli, Syria, Osman joined <b>Vitesse's</b> youth setup in 2008, aged 15, after {{starting}} {{it out at}} DVV. On 5 July 2013 he signed his first professional contract with the club.|$|R
5|$|During {{the process}} of the Lillehammer bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics, the International Olympic Committee had not {{specified}} that it was necessary with an indoor speed skating rink. Calgary had used the indoor Olympic Oval during the 1988 Winter Olympics, but Albertville, who were awarded the 1992 Winter Olympics, had opted for the outdoor L'anneau de <b>vitesse.</b> In its bid, the speed skating events were planned held at Stampesletta, an outdoor track and field stadium in Lillehammer. Only after Lillehammer had been awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics was it decided that an indoor venue would have to be built for the games.|$|E
5|$|After {{his success}} in Belgium with Gent, Mido signed a five-year {{contract}} with Eredivisie team Ajax in 2001. He suffered a concussion during their UEFA Cup match with Limassol, after colliding with a defender. He made his return for the team against Heerenveen, a match which Ajax lost 5–1. However, he was sent off against Twente, after kicking Spira Grujić whilst trying to beat him to the ball, {{for which he was}} later given a three-match ban. He returned for Ajax against <b>Vitesse,</b> coming on as a substitute in the 75th minute. He failed to be selected for the substitutes bench against Feyenoord in March 2002, which was due to a minor clash with manager Ronald Koeman, and Mido left for a short vacation in Cairo. Mido scored in Ajax's victory over Utrecht in the KNVB Cup final, meaning he ended the 2001–02 season with the Dutch League and Cup double.|$|E
5|$|Early in January Feyenoord {{announced}} they parted ways with Cissé. On 5 January, the club played a charity match in De Kuip against Excelsior to support cancer research. They won 1–0 after a late goal by Vilhena. After this friendly {{they went to}} Marbella for a one-week training camp which ended with the second and last friendly of the winter break. They lost this game 0–1 against reigning Swiss champion FC Basel. Feyenoord resumed the season on 19 January with a 5–2 away win against FC Utrecht in {{a game in which}} the club trailed twice. Schaken scored both in the first and second half; Pellè, De Vrij and Vilhena all added to the scoreline once. On 22 January, Feyenoord got knocked out of the KNVB Cup in the quarter-finals in a 3–1 loss to Ajax. The following Saturday Feyenoord lost 3–2 away at ADO Den Haag. Feyenoord's last match of the month was played at home on the 31st against <b>Vitesse</b> Arnhem. The match ended in a 1–1 draw after a first half goal by Pellè.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2014, the Camarillo-based chip company {{announced}} a $23.2M stock offering, a planned sale of 7.5 million shares at $3.35 each, {{to be used}} for working capital and general corporate purposes. This raise would be <b>Vitesse's</b> third in two years.|$|R
50|$|Brand was {{dismissed}} {{as head of}} <b>Vitesse's</b> football academy in 2003 after criticizing the club's directors. He was named academy manager at ADO Den Haag, but resigned before he ever worked for the club and left them for PSV in summer 2003. He quit PSV in 2006. He later worked for amateur side IJsselmeervogels.|$|R
50|$|Having {{struggled}} with various injuries, Pedersen {{found it difficult}} to hold down a spot in <b>Vitesse's</b> starting eleven. He was subsequently sent on loan to Norwegian club Vålerenga on 22 February 2012, and managed 8 goals in 15 league appearances until the loan-deal ended on 1 August. On 21 August 2012, he was fined by the Football Association of Norway for making homophobic remarks towards Stabæk supporters 22 July 2012.|$|R
5|$|Feyenoord started October on {{the road}} against <b>Vitesse</b> Arnhem on 6 October with a 1–2 win after two first half goals by De Vrij and Pellè. Pellè's goal marked his tenth league goal this season. Their second match in October was played away in Deventer against Go Ahead Eagles on the 19th. The game ended in a 2–2 draw after Feyenoord gained the lead twice by goals of De Vrij and Immers. The team played Heracles Almelo {{at home on the}} 27th {{resulting}} in a 1–2 loss after a first half own goal by Nelom and second half red card for Pellè.

5|$|Samaras' {{first goal}} of the 2004–05 season came on 11 September, in a 2–0 win over De Graafschap. He then scored a last-minute winner on 3 October, as Heerenveen secure all three points against ADO Den Haag. On 28 November, Samaras scored one of Heerenveen's goals as they staged a late {{comeback}} against title-chasing Feyenoord, and secured a 2–2 draw. He then scored on 22 January, as Heerenveen, who were performing {{very well in the}} Eredivisie, beat Den Bosch 2–1. On 12 March, Samaras scored an equaliser against RKC Waalwijk, but Heerenveen then conceded a late goal and fell to a 2–1 defeat. On 2 April, Samaras scored to help Heerenveen secure a shock 2–1 victory over Ajax. A fortnight later, Samaras scored the equaliser as Heerenveen came from behind to beat <b>Vitesse</b> Arnhem 3–1. This win moved Heerenveen up to fifth in the table. In the next match Samaras, along with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, scored a hat-trick as relegation candidates RBC Roosendaal were defeated 7–1 and Heerenveen pushed to finish the league in a European spot.|$|E
25|$|In European competition, as <b>Vitesse</b> {{reached the}} UEFA Cup quarter-finals, Van der Gouw kept four {{consecutive}} clean sheets, before the side eventually lost to Sporting CP. <b>Vitesse</b> consistently {{finished in the}} top six in subsequent seasons, but were less impressive in Europe, suffering a 3–0 aggregate defeat to Norwich City, among other results.|$|E
50|$|In the 2015-2016 season, Cruyff {{appointed}} Slavisa Jokanovic as {{head coach}} after the Serbian had promoted Watford to the Premier League. The team qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stages {{for the first time}} in 11 years, playing against Chelsea, Porto and Dynamo Kyiv in Group G before exiting the competition. Jordi appointed <b>Vitesse's</b> Peter Bosz after Jokanovic signed as the new Fulham's head coach at the end of December.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the company's overt {{sense of}} humor, its {{products}} were ultra detailed and precise in proportion and presentation. Rixon reports on <b>Vitesse's</b> 1960 Aston Martin DB4 {{commenting on the}} model's [...] "simulated wooden steering wheel", [...] "banks of dashboard clocks", and [...] "metal mesh radiator" [...] and [...] "astonishing photo etched wire spoke wheels" [...] (2005, p. 62). Other European cars like the 1938 BMW 328 roadster were typical. The 2-tone Austin Healey 3000 was very well-designed...even if the paint peeled off of the sides.|$|R
50|$|Born in Apeldoorn, Diks joined <b>Vitesse's</b> youth setup in 2005, aged nine, {{after playing}} for VIOS Vaassen and hometown's AGOVV Apeldoorn. In the 2014 summer {{he was called}} to the main squad for the pre-season, also {{appearing}} in a 1-3 defeat against Chelsea. On 24 August 2014, after proffiting from first-choice Wallace's injury, Diks made his first-team - and Eredivisie - debut, starting in a 1-2 away loss against PEC Zwolle. On 8 January of the following year, after being already a permanent part of the main squad, he renewed his link until 2018.|$|R

The club also reached the final of the domestic cup.|$|E
50|$|The 1986 season had all {{the signs}} of being a classic year for the {{champion}}ship. Never before or since have were so many works cars entered. 1985 champion team Eggenberger Motorsport switched from Volvo to Ford, becoming their works team with the fast but fragile, turbocharged Ford Sierra XR4Ti. Defending champion manufacturer Volvo turned to Belgian outfit RAS Sport to run the factory Volvo 240T turbo's, while Tom Walkinshaw Racing again entered three (or sometimes more) Rover <b>Vitesse's</b> on behalf of Austin Rover. The 3.5 litre V8 Rovers {{had been on a}} steady development path since 1982 and were still surprisingly competitive. Schnitzer Motorsport found some extra horsepower during the winter and their factory backed BMW 635 CSi's became a force once again, while 1986 also saw Australian marque Holden racing in Europe for the first time. The Aussie charge was led by Allan Grice's privateer Australian National Motor Racing Team and Peter Brock's famed Holden Dealer Team who entered some races with their 4.9 L V8 Commodore's ahead of the 1987 World Touring Car Championship season. And this was only Division 3.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1967 {{the range}} was updated with the {{introduction}} at the London Motor Show of the Herald 13/60. The 13/60 was offered in saloon, convertible and estate-bodied versions. The sun-roof remained available for the saloon as an optional extra rather than a standard feature. The front end was restyled using a bonnet similar to the Triumph <b>Vitesse's</b> and the interior substantially revised though still featuring the wooden dashboard. Interior space was improved by recessing a rear armrest in each side panel. The engine was enlarged to 1296 cc, essentially the unit employed since 1965 in the Triumph 1300, fitted with a Stromberg CD150 carburettor, offering [...] and much improved performance. In this form (though the 1200 saloon was sold alongside it {{until the end of}} 1970) the Herald Saloon lasted until December 1970 and the Convertible and Estate until May 1971, by which time, severely outdated in style if not performance, it had already outlived the introduction of the Triumph 1300 Saloon, the car designed to replace it and was still selling reasonably well but, because of its labour-intensive method of construction, selling at a loss.|$|R
