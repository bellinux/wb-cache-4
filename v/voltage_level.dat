25|$|The one-bit SD {{protocol}} {{was derived from}} the MMC protocol, which envisioned the ability to put up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use open collector interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high <b>voltage</b> <b>level</b> (because of a pull-up resistor) if no card pulls it low. Though the cards shared clock and signal lines, each card had its own chip select line to sense that the host device had selected it.|$|E

This means that the op-amp is set up as a comparator to detect a positive voltage. If the voltage to be sensed, Ei, is applied to op amp's (+) input, the result is a noninverting positive-level detector: when Ei is above Vref, VO equals +Vsat; when Ei is below Vref, VO equals −Vsat. If Ei is applied to the inverting input, the circuit is an inverting positive-level detector: When Ei is above Vref, VO equals −Vsat.|$|E

In the alternate scenario, ie. the case where harmonic <b>voltage</b> <b>levels</b> are acceptable, considerable expense may be incurred mitigating harmonic currents unnecessarily due to lack of knowledge of harmonic levels and/or network capabilities. As such, there is considerable potential for industry to make large economic gains if harmonic <b>voltage</b> <b>levels</b> can be better understood.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{the design}} of {{multiple}} output power supply is presented. An Embedded system requires different <b>voltage</b> <b>levels</b> for its proper functioning because the components used in any embedded system required different <b>voltage</b> <b>levels</b> as per their specifications, so this paper proposed a power supply that includes + 15 V,- 15 V, + 5 V,- 5 V, + 3. 3 V, + 5 V Isolated <b>voltage</b> <b>levels.</b> The input for this power supply is 48 V DC which is available at all telecom sites. This power supply is capable of providing approximate 40 W output power with 80 % efficiency. The power supply design topology selected for this paper is flyback converter because flyback converter is a better option as compare to other topologies for low power design and for generating multiple output <b>voltage</b> <b>levels.</b> This power supply is designed by low cost and highly efficient discrete components and the paper also describes the criteria of choosing these components. This supply designed here {{can be used for}} almost all applications in telecom embedded products due to its versatile range of constant output <b>voltage</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Drain {{efficiency}} is {{the ratio of}} output RF power to input DC power when primary input DC power has been fed to the drain of a field-effect transistor. Based on this definition, the drain efficiency cannot exceed 25% for a class A amplifier that is supplied drain bias current through resistors (because RF signal has its zero level at about 50% of the input DC). Manufacturers specify much higher drain efficiencies, and designers are able to obtain higher efficiencies by providing current to the drain of the transistor through an inductor or a transformer winding. [...] In this case the RF zero level is near the DC rail and will swing both {{above and below the}} rail during operation. [...] While the <b>voltage</b> <b>level</b> is above the DC rail current is supplied by the inductor.|$|E

40|$|Synthetic power grids, that is, {{test cases}} {{designed}} to match realistic structural and statistical characteristics of actual grids, {{are useful for}} research, development, and demonstration of innovations, since the cases are fictitious and thus free from data confidentiality issues. Building on previous work, this paper addresses a couple of related problems in the transmission network synthesis process. These issues appear as created cases become larger and involve multiple areas and overlapping nominal <b>voltage</b> <b>levels.</b> A fast, scalable hierarchical clustering is designed to assign <b>voltage</b> <b>levels</b> to substations considering {{the needs of the}} system, the specific constraints of the area, and smooth interconnections between neighboring areas with different <b>voltage</b> <b>levels.</b> A line topology generation framework is considered that is appropriate for many networks of different <b>voltage</b> <b>levels,</b> constructed together for a useful, realistic grid. These methods are demonstrated in a new 2000 bus test case, validated and publicly released...|$|R

30|$|If {{the voltage}} {{modulation}} ratio is small, {{the number of}} the output <b>voltage</b> <b>levels</b> would decrease, which increase the harmonic contents. In order to address the above issue, improved control scheme of UPFC should be adopted. For example, the coordinate control of the series MMC and shunt MMC should be implemented, to improve the number of output <b>voltage</b> <b>levels</b> by reducing the single SM’s capacitor voltage. Moreover, the margin of the voltage modulation ratio, redundant SMs and on-load tap regulation switch of the shunt transformer should be employed to increase {{the number of the}} output <b>voltage</b> <b>levels.</b> The above improved control scheme of UPFC would not increase the investment, and can improve the control and operation feasibility of UPFC.|$|R
