40|$|The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a <b>voluntary</b> <b>set-aside</b> {{program in}} the United States {{designed}} to ame-liorate soil erosion, control crop overproduction, enhance water quality, and provide wildlife habitat by replacing crops with other forms of land cover. Because CRP includes primarily grass habitats, it has great potential to bene-fit declining North American grassland bird populations. We looked at the change in national and state population trends of grassland birds and related changes to cover-specific CRP variables (previous research grouped all CRP practices). Changes in national trends after the initiation of the CRP were inconclusive, but we observed signficant bird-CRP relations at the state level. Most bird-CRP relations were positive, except for some species associated with habitats that CRP replaced. Practice- and configuration-specific CRP variables were related to grassland bird trends, rather than a generic measure of all CRP types combined. Considering all CRP land as a single, distinct habitat type may obscure actual relations between birds and set-aside characteristics. Understanding and predic-ting the effects of set-aside programs (like CRP or agri-environment schemes) on grassland birds is complex and difficult. Because available broad-scale datasets are less than adequate, studies should be conducted {{at a variety of}} spatial and temporal scales. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{maintenance}} of fallows {{has been shown}} to prevent the loss of farmland biodiversity caused by agricultural intensification. These are mainly introduced as part of both obligatory and <b>voluntary</b> <b>set-aside</b> schemes. However, the obligatory set-aside has recently been abolished by the Common Agricultural Policy Health Check. In this study, we examine the role of fallow in fine-grained habitat use by a threatened farmland bird (Lesser Kestrel) during summer in northwestern Spain. To analyze Lesser Kestrel occurrence, we used generalized linear models, a theoretic-information approach and a hierarchical partitioning analysis. The best AIC-based models explaining occurrence of Lesser Kestrels showed that fallow was the more important habitat type followed, to a lesser extent, by dry cereal stubble and field margin. In contrast, irrigated crops negatively influenced occurrence. Heterogeneity of crop mosaic was not important in explaining occurrence of Lesser Kestrel. Fallows, like dry cereal stubbles and field margins, seem to be suitable for foraging given the abundance of high food resources and their availability due to shorter vegetation cover. The abolition of the obligatory set-aside could reduce the total surface of fallow land (approximately 40. 9 %), likely affecting habitat use by Lesser Kestrel through an increase of other non-preferred crops (e. g., irrigated crops) or by decreasing food resources. Agri-environment schemes focusing on the {{maintenance of}} low-intensive farming systems with a mosaic of crops and semi-natural habitats interspersed should be promoted in premigratory areas to maintain Lesser Kestrel...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The U. S. farm {{sector has}} {{undergone}} dramatic structural change {{during the past}} fifty years, a chief result being {{that the number of}} large farms has increased relative to the number of small farms. Numerous agricultural policies have been instituted, with the partial objective of preserving the family farm. At the same time, {{a number of studies have}} attempted to ascertain the contribution of various forces, including farm programs, toward the observed changes in average farm size. These studies have tended to concentrate on aggregate effects, ignoring farm-level and dynamic effects of program and nonprogram factors on farm growth. The present study overcomes such limitations by utilizing a farm-level dynamic growth model which links consumption, production, and investment decisions. Steady-state comparative static and local comparative dynamic analysis of the dynamic model solutions indicate qualitative effects of program and nonprogram factors on farm growth. Simulation of quantitative effects are conducted on econometric estimates of the dynamic model solutions, using Kansas wheat farm data. Empirical results show that set-aside-percentage-type instruments (required and <b>voluntary</b> <b>set-aside</b> percentages) induce longrun net equity increases in small farms and longrun net equity decreases in large farms. In both size classes, set-aside instruments increase longrun land holdings, the increases being greater in larger than in smaller farms. After considering effects on rented land, the effect of set-aside-type instruments on overall scale of operation is negligible. Payment-rate-type instruments (per-acre deficiency, voluntary and paid diversion payment rates) increase longrun net equity and consumption in both small and large farms. They lead to longrun land ownership increases in small farms and decreases in large farms. However, they lead also to increases in rented land, the increase being greater in larger than in smaller farms. Net effect on scale of operation is nonsignificant. Finally, nonprogram factors affect growth also. Technical change increases net equity and landholding in large farms more than in small farms. In both large and small farms, increases in prices of land's substitutes, lead to net equity increases, whereas increases in prices of complements reduce net equity. In the longrun, output price increases encourage consumption and reduce net equity...|$|E
40|$|Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) {{certification}} scheme {{emerged as an}} instrument to notify well managed forests. There are endless discussions about the actual FSC certification contribution to biodiversity conservation. In this thesis Lithuanian FSC certified forests were assessed regarding biodiversity protection measures implemented on the ground. First, FSC Lithuanian standard indicators concerning biodiversity measures were selected and grouped according to the spatial scales of forest management {{that had to be}} performed in order to satisfy a certain indictor. Secondly, <b>voluntary</b> and formally <b>set-aside</b> areas for biodiversity conservation in FSC certified State Forest Enterprises (SFE) were compared. Lastly I examined structural habitat connectivity using morphological spatial pattern analysis tool. Lithuanian FSC standard indicators requirements were focused on the stand and landscape scales, while there were no indicators regarding ecoregion. The formally set-aside area was more than two times larger than voluntary. Structural habitat analysis showed that the most set-aside patches were smaller than 10 ha and had a small fraction of old forests. I discuss that FSC standard focuses on species with small habitat requirements. Moreover formal forest protection, due to several protection levels does not provide the same conservation measures, while <b>voluntary</b> <b>set-asides</b> are treated evenly. I conclude that to understand a role of FSC certification in forest biodiversity conservation it is important to evaluate formally and <b>voluntary</b> <b>set-asides</b> from protected species perspective to see functionality of the protected areas...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{essential}} component of many forest certification schemes is that landowners should voluntarily set aside a proportion of their forestland with the main aim of promoting biodiversity. However, the influence on biodiversity of such conservation areas is largely unknown. In this study, we compared the area extent, structural diversity of importance to biodiversity and stand characteristics between <b>voluntary</b> <b>set-asides</b> (VSA 1 <b>Voluntary</b> <b>set-asides.</b> 1) established through certification, formally state-protected nature reserves (R 2 Reserves and national parks. 2) and managed production forests (PF 3 Production forests. 3). We used data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory and focused on forestry company land in boreal Sweden, amounting to about 7 million ha. VSA and R were found to cover approximately the same area (0. 6 million ha each) but VSA were more numerous, especially for sizes 10, 000 ha belonged to R. VSA also occurred in more southerly locations. VSA were intermediate between R and PF regarding dead wood volume, number of large diameter trees haâˆ’ 1 and value of a composite structural index. VSA had significantly higher volumes of the important broadleaved trees species aspen, rowan and sallow. VSA and R were much older and had lower site productivity than PF, but VSA had higher total standing volumes. Our analysis showed that certified-driven VSA are an important complement to traditional reserves regarding size and structural factors important to biodiversity. Thus, future development of planning models should consider both types of set-asides and their spatial configuration. This will require integration of non-state and state governance processes...|$|R
40|$|Today, the {{importance}} of restoring natural forest disturbance regimes and habitat structures for biodiversity is widely recognized. We evaluated the immediate effects of two restoration methods on wood-inhabiting (saproxylic) beetles in boreal forest <b>voluntary</b> <b>set-asides.</b> We used a before-after control-impact experimental set-up in 15 set-asides; each {{assigned to one of}} three treatments: (1) restoration burning, (2) gap cutting and (3) no-treatment reference stands. Before treatment, abundance, species richness and assemblage composition of trapped beetles did not differ significantly among treatments. Burning resulted in a significant change in assemblage composition and increased species richness and abundance compared to reference stands. As predicted, saproxylic species known to be fire favoured increased dramatically after burning. The immediate response shows that, initially, fire favoured species are attracted from the surrounding landscape and not produced on site. Gap cutting increased the abundance of cambium consumers but had no significant effect on total species richness or assemblage composition of saproxylic beetles. The stronger effect of burning compared to gap cutting on saproxylic assemblages is probably due to the very specific conditions created by fires that attracts many disturbance-dependent species, but {{that at the same time}} disfavour some disturbance-sensitive species. By contrast, gap cutting maintained assemblage composition, increased abundances and is likely to increase species richness in the years to follow, due to elevated level of dead wood. The restoration methods applied in this study may prove particularly useful, partly because of positive effect on saproxylic beetles, but also due to the cost-efficiency of the measures; the <b>voluntary</b> <b>set-asides</b> were already established and the restoration costs fully covered by revenue from the extracted timber...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide {{declines in}} {{biodiversity}} have accentuated {{the need for}} conservation actions. Unfortunately, the decline {{is unlikely to be}} reversed by traditional conservation alone. Instead the practice of ecological restoration has come to play an ever increasing role. It is therefore important to develop methods that are beneficial for biodiversity, cost efficient and applicable on larger scales. By using a before-after control-impact experiment in boreal forest <b>voluntary</b> <b>set-asides,</b> I evaluated the response of forest-dwelling beetles and flat bugs to two cost neutral ecological restoration methods. The two restoration treatments, restoration burning and artificial gap creation were aimed at emulating natural disturbance processes, {{at the same time as}} they were expected to improve conditions for biodiversity. I compared the results from the two treatments with that of unmanaged reference stands. I found that beetles showed strongest response to restoration burning by increasing in abundance and species richness directly, as well as one year after restoration. In addition the composition of species communities differed significantly between beetles collected in burned stands compared to those collected in gap-cut and reference stands immediately after restoration. One year after restoration the composition of species communities differed significantly between all three treatment groups. Flat bugs also responded strongest to restoration burning by displaying higher abundance and species richness in burned stands compared to gap-cut- and reference stands. I also found that dead wood substrate type mattered for beetles. Tree species and tree posture, i. e. if the trees were standing up or lying down, had the strongest effect on the composition of species communities emerging from the dead wood. In addition, tree species was of importance for abundance and species richness in gap-cut stands, where spruce trees generally had higher counts that birch- and pine trees. As the <b>voluntary</b> <b>set-asides</b> already were established and the restoration costs were fully covered by revenues from the extracted timber, the restoration methods applied in this study may prove particularly useful. Not only because of the positive effects on forest biodiversity, but also due to their high level of applicability and cost effectivenes...|$|R
40|$|In Sweden, a multi-scaled {{model for}} {{conservation}} of biodiversity in forests {{has been developed}} since the early 1990 s. This model can be divided conceptually into three different levels; (i) retention forestry in the production forests; (ii) voluntary forest set-asides; and (iii) formally protected forests. This thesis explores the debate, implementation and outcomes in the forest of these conservation measures. From being absent from public debate, forestry became heavily criticised during the early 1970 s due to aerial spraying of herbicides to control deciduous trees on clear-cuts. The criticism of forestry and increased awareness of the problems concerned with forestry from a conservation perspective put strong pressure on the forestry sector. As a result, Swedish forestry and conservation policy was changed fundamentally during the 1990 s and many new conservation measures were implemented. I have {{identified a number of}} driving forces behind this development which include the compilation of Red Lists, demands from foreign customers and forest certification. I present, in a paper from 1997, management options which mimic natural forest disturbance regimes better than traditional forestry and I reflect on the implementation of these ideas. One important outcome of the new ideas during the 1990 s is the practical application of retention forestry in Sweden. My results clearly show that young forests have become structurally richer since the introduction of the retention approach. The number of retention trees and amount of dead wood in young stands increased between 1997 and 2007. I also compared the area extent, structural diversity of importance to biodiversity and stand characteristics between <b>voluntary</b> <b>set-asides,</b> formally state-protected nature reserves and managed production forests. My analysis shows that <b>voluntary</b> <b>set-asides</b> are an important complement to traditional reserves in terms of geographical location, size and structural factors important to biodiversity. In conclusion a combination of historical perspective and landscape-level data give us the opportunity both to understand complex developments and to develop tools for future successful conservation measures in the Swedish forests...|$|R
40|$|Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) {{is one of}} {{the leading}} forest {{certification}} schemes. While many studies concern political aspects and social outcomes of FSC, little is known about the contribution of certification to biodiversity conservation. In Europe, the Russian Federation and Sweden have the largest areas of FSC certified forest. We assessed the potential of FSC certification for boreal biodiversity conservation in terms of standard content, and outcomes as habitat area set aside and habitat network functionality. First, we compared the biodiversity conservation indicators at different spatial scales in Swedish and Russian FSC standards. Second, focusing on one large state forest management unit in each country, we compared the areas of formally and voluntarily set aside forests for biodiversity conservation. Third, we evaluated the structural habitat connectivity by applying morphological spatial pattern analysis, and potential functional connectivity by using habitat suitability index modelling for virtual species. The Russian standard included indicators for all spatial scales of biodiversity conservation, from tree and stand to land-scape and ecoregions. The Swedish standard focused mainly on stand and tree scales. The area of <b>voluntary</b> <b>set-asides</b> for FSC was similar in Sweden and Russia, while formal protection in the Russian case study was three times higher than in the Swedish one. Swedish set-aside core areas were two orders of magnitude smaller, had much lower structural and potential functional connectivity and were located in a fragmented forestland holding. We conclude that to understand the potential of FSC certification for biodiversity conservation both the standard content, and its implementation on the ground, need to be assessed. We discuss the potential of FSC certification for biodiversity conservation with different levels of ambition. We stress the need for developing rapid assessment tools to evaluate outcomes of FSC for biodiversity conservation on the ground, which could be used by forest managers and FSC-auditors toward adaptive governance and management...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to measure the level of the European Union's (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) price support system (PSS) applied to producers in the EU- 15 and in Turkey. The producer subsidy estimate (PSE) method has been used to determine protection levels for selected cereal products from the beginning of the application of the PSE method in 1986 to date. In addition, this study attempts to examine the empirical findings of the PSE in the light of CAP reforms and EU enlargements during the period 1986 - 2003. The expected contribution {{of this study is to}} determine which support instruments, such as countervailing levies or direct payments (based on limited or unlimited area) against export subsidies, <b>voluntary</b> or compulsory <b>set-aside</b> measures and price interventions, are more appropriate for the CAP in reducing destabilizing effects on trade with selected products between the EU and Turkey with respect to distribution effects (how income is distributed between different groups involved in the production operation process). Does the current PSS of the CAP have positive effects on agricultural producers in Turkey as a non-member country? The major finding of this dissertation is the evaluation of benefits and costs of common agricultural policies of the EU on fair trade. The assessment of the PSE of the EU's CAP will be used to determine the impact of current support measures of the CAP reforms on fair trade and consumer welfare, and how the CAP measures can be reformed for the improvement of producer gain in accordance with fair trade.

40|$|Background The {{traditional}} approach to limiting impacts of forestry on biodiversity {{is to set}} aside forest areas of particular conservation interest, either as formally protected reserves or on a <b>voluntary</b> basis. Many <b>set-asides</b> are left more or less untouched, {{but some of them}} have a history of disturbances such as wildfires, forest grazing, coppicing or small-scale felling. Such areas may gradually lose the qualities that were to be safeguarded unless the disturbances are re-introduced (e. g. by burning) or replaced with alternatives (e. g. gap-felling). Active management of forest set-asides may be particularly relevant in areas where the biota has been impoverished by intensive and large-scale harvesting. Here, biodiversity {{may not be able to}} recover adequately without restoration measures such as gap-felling or creation of dead wood. In recent years, interest in active management of forest set-asides has increased, but opinions differ among conservationists on how such management should be balanced against non-intervention. The topic of the proposed systematic review has therefore met approval among stakeholders in Sweden, where it is currently an issue of high concern. Methods The review will examine primary field studies of how various forms of active management have affected biodiversity in boreal or temperate forests set aside for conservation or restoration. The primary focus will be on forest types represented in Sweden. In some cases, useful insights about management options may also be provided by studies of interventions in commercially managed forests. Non-intervention or alternative forms of active management will be used as comparators. Relevant outcomes include assemblage diversity (species richness, diversity indices), abundance of different functional or taxonomic groups of organisms, population viability of target species, and indicators of forest biodiversity such as forest structure and amounts of dead wood. The relevant scientific literature may turn out to be very heterogeneous, however. Numerous combinations of management forms and biodiversity outcomes can be conceived, and it remains to be seen whether any such combination is covered by sufficiently many studies to allow a meaningful meta-analysis. Nonetheless, it should be feasible to achieve a useful narrative synthesis of the available evidence...|$|R
