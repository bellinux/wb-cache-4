5000|$|Helmet - A helmet with strap, and {{optionally}} a face cage or visor, {{is required}} of all ice hockey players. Hockey helmets come in various sizes, {{and many of the}} older designs can also be adjusted by loosening or fastening screws at the side or at the back. Ice hockey helmets are made of a rigid but flexible thermoplastic outer shell, usually nylon or ABS, with firm <b>vinyl</b> <b>nitrile</b> foam padding inside to reduce shocks. Even with the helmet and visor/face cage, concussions and facial injuries are common injuries in the sport.|$|E
50|$|Gloves {{are used}} in the Foodservice Industry for {{minimizing}} contact with ready to eat foods. Generally, foodservice employees are required to wash hands before starting work or putting on single-use gloves. Due to the incidence of latex allergies, many people switch to <b>vinyl</b> or <b>nitrile</b> gloves. Poly gloves are a very inexpensive alternative. Latex, <b>Vinyl</b> and <b>Nitrile</b> gloves are available in powder and powder-free varieties. The powder in the gloves are made of USDA cornstarch. Powder-free gloves are generally more expensive than powdered gloves because gloves must be powdered to be removed from the mold they are made on. The majority of disposable gloves are manufactured in China, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the capacity of <b>vinyl</b> <b>nitrile</b> and expanded polypropylene, two materials commonly used in ice hockey helmets, to reduce the peak linear acceleration, peak angular acceleration, and head injury criterion values during a direct impact to a hybrid III headform. Six different ice hockey helmets were tested using a pneumatic linear impactor at velocities similar to those in hockey. The results showed that helmets using expanded polypropylene foam liners are significantly better at reducing linear acceleration; however, helmets using <b>vinyl</b> <b>nitrile</b> foam liners are significantly better at reducing angular acceleration. Furthermore, the impact location influenced the performance of the liner...|$|E
40|$|Head injuries, and {{concussion}} in particular, {{have become}} a source of interest in the sport of ice hockey. This study proposes a monorail test methodology combined with a finite element method to evaluate ice hockey helmets in a centric/non-centric protocol with performance metrics more closely associated with risk of concussion. Two conditions were tested using the protocol: (a) helmeted versus no helmet, and (b) <b>vinyl</b> <b>nitrile</b> lined hockey helmet versus expanded polypropylene lined hockey helmet. The results indicate that the impact velocities and locations produced distinct responses. Also, the protocol distinguished important design characteristics of the two helmet liner types, with the <b>vinyl</b> <b>nitrile</b> lined helmet producing lower strain responses in the cerebrum. Furthermore, it was discovered that low risk of injury peak linear and rotational acceleration values can combine to produce much higher risks of injury when using brain deformation metrics. In conclusion, the use of finite element modeling of the human brain along with a centric/non-centric protocol provides an opportunity for researchers and helmet developers to observe how the dynamic response produced by these impacts influences brain tissue deformation and injury risk. This type of centric/non-centric physical to finite element modeling methodology could be used to guide innovation for new methods to prevent concussion...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{assessed}} {{the ability of}} hockey helmets to protect against falls and collisions, yet none have addressed the injury risk associated with puck impacts. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} study was to document the capacity of a typical <b>vinyl</b> <b>nitrile</b> ice hockey helmet to reduce head accelerations and brain deformation caused by a puck impact. A bare and a helmeted Hybrid III male 50 th percentile headform was struck with a puck three times to the forehead at 17, 23, 29, 35, and 41 m/s using a pneumatic puck launcher. Linear and rotational accelerations were captured using accelerometers fitted in the headform and used as input in the University College Dublin Brain Trauma Model to obtain brain deformation. The helmet reduced peak resultant linear acceleration, peak resultant rotational acceleration, and maximum principal strain, but a comparison with published brain injury risk curves shows that it did not reduce the concussion risk below 50 % for impacts at or above 23 m/s. Thus, a <b>vinyl</b> <b>nitrile</b> ice hockey helmet can protect players from direct puck impacts in amateur and youth leagues but may not be adequate in competitive elite leagues, where the puck can be shot at velocities well above 23 m/s. Furthermore, competitive adult male ice hockey players struck to the helmet by a puck may need to consider changing their helmet, as it was shown that direct impacts at or above 35 m/s decreased the helmet’s ability to reduce head peak linear acceleration in subsequent impacts...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the past}} decades, {{there has been}} {{increasing}} interest in alternative fuels in the aviation industry. However for these alternative fuels to be accepted they must show they do not affect materials, particularly elastomers, in aircraft significantly different than standard 100 low lead (100 LL). This research is focused on comparing {{the effects of a}} proprietary bio-derived alternative fuel on elastomers against 100 LL. Materials to be tested are Buna-N <b>vinyl,</b> neoprene, <b>nitrile,</b> plain cork, neoprene and cork (backed cork), Viton, high-purity silicone, polyester, polysulfide and rubber hose. The testing to be performed includes volume swell, tensile strength, elongation, durometer hardness and density. The samples were soaked in fuel for a period of 28 days at room temperature, 71 °C and 93 °C. All testing will be done in accordance with respective ASTM standards. Due to proprietary concerns, actual measurement cannot be reported, but differences between the two fuels can, i. e. the percentage difference between materials soaked in 100 LL and the bio-derived alternative. Statistical methods were applied to the volume change, tensile strength and elongation tests to determine significant differences. The largest difference in volume swell was for backed cork, the largest difference in tensile and elongation was in neoprene, the largest difference in density was in nitrile, and plain cork exhibited the largest difference in durometer hardness. Viton and polyester exhibited no significant differences. Limited testing conducted with a second bio-derived alternative showed polysulfide as having the greatest difference between the two bio-derived fuels...|$|R
40|$|Gloves {{are worn}} in labs and animal rooms to protect workers from {{hazardous}} chemicals, biological materials, radioactive materials, sharp objects, {{or a combination}} of these. No one glove is available to protect laboratory workers against all potential hazardous exposures. It is crucial that type of glove being used is the right one for the job since incorrect gloves may provide no protection and even cause a fatal incident. A Dartmouth College chemistry professor died in 1997 from exposure to dimethylmercury, which penetrated her latex gloves. Glove Selection: Proper glove selection is essential to insure glove performance as a barrier to hazards. Selection of the proper hazard-resistant glove begins with an evaluation of potential hazards associated with the task. Biological Hazards Standard latex exam gloves provide protection for biological hazards. Non-latex gloves such as synthetic rubber, <b>nitrile,</b> <b>vinyl,</b> or neoprene also provide acceptable barrier protection against virus and other microorganisms without the potential to cause severe allergic reactions associated with latex.

40|$|Performance {{advantages}} of incorporating fluid channels into a foam made of DERTEX VN 600 (<b>vinyl</b> <b>nitrile)</b> are evaluated. This foam {{has the potential}} to replace the traditional foam material of helmet liners, like expanded polystyrene (EPS). The experiments involved dropping a certified size E headform vertically onto a flat, solid anvil. Elastically deformable and resilient VN foam outperformed EPS during all impacts. Incorporating a viscous aqueous solution of 30 % by weight glycerin into 3 / 8 in. (0. 95 cm) diameter channels machined through VN foam, reduced the peak headform acceleration by 12 % on first impact compared to VN foam samples without fluid channels. The reduction was 17 % when compared to EPS foam samples. The duration of the first impact increased by 27 % over EPS, significantly lowering the associated head injury criterion values. Repeated impact testing demonstrated an increasing performance advantage of incorporating fluid channels. Samples incorporating 30 % glycerin solution reduced the peak headform acceleration after six impacts by 50 % as compared to EPS...|$|E
40|$|Gosio“, „Wetterhahn“, „Minamata“, and „Black Foot Disease“ {{are only}} some {{synonyms}} counting for the hazards and risks of methylated metal(loid) organic compounds. Furthermore {{they point out}} how significant the properties of inorganic metal(loid) s {{differ from those of}} their methylated organic form. Thus, this dissertation deals with the speciation and toxicity of metal(loid) organic compounds with a particular focus on Hg, As and Sb in biological and environmental relevant systems. At least since the tragic accident of Prof. K. Wetterhahn as the result of dimethylmercury poisoning caused by the spill of a few drops of this chemical on her glove-covered hand, it is known that these compound can penetrate Latex gloves. However, only very little is known about permeation through other disposable glove materials or for different metal(loid) organic compounds like e. g. tetramethyl tin (Me 4 Sn) or trimethyl bismut (Me 3 Bi)) under typical laboratory conditions. With a new developed, heated permeation cell the breakthrough time of Me 2 Hg, Me 4 Sn, Me 3 GeCl, Me 2 AsI, and Me 3 Bi for various protective glove materials are determined. The results have shown, that most typically used disposable protective gloves (<b>vinyl,</b> vatex, <b>nitrile)</b> are penetrated within seconds and thus do not provide suitable protection. Methylated metal(loid) compounds are formed in the environment, favored by increased temperatures and anoxic conditions. In times of increasingly scarce of fossil fuel, biogas plants, which already have a great share in the production of renewable energy in Germany, are upcoming new diffuse and usually not accounted for sources of metal(loid) organic compounds (HotSpots). By the way, these plants are typically canvas-covered and metal(loid) s may also penetrate these foils. Therefore in this work four different biogas plants (biodigestor, postfermenter, condensation water and biogas) are analyzed. In all biogas samples permethylated metal(loid) organic compounds are detected (31 - 694 ng/m³ Me 3 As, 0 - 2 ng/m³ Me 2 Hg, 0 - 7000 ng/m³ Me 3 Sb und 0 - 79 ng/m³ Me 4 Sn). As expected both, the biodigestor as well as the postfermenter, are an origin of many partly and per methylated arsenic, antimony, mercury, and tin species. The gas condensates are estimated as a potential sink for methylated metal(loid) compounds. Beside highly toxic dimethyl mercury (> 0. 1 µg/L) different methylated arsenic species (e. g. Me 3 As > 90 µg/L) as well as several not identified antimony species were detected in the condensates. While the toxicology of the inorganic form of the metal(loid) is mostly well documented {{and some of them are}} relatively low toxic, the toxicity of their metal(loid) organic species is mostly hard to determine. However, the permeation capability of metal(loid) organic compounds through membranes can also be used to evaluate the toxicity of these highly volatile substances. Therefore CHO- 9 cells—an established cell system for toxicity testing, CaCo cells—human colon cells, and HepG 2 cells cells—human hepatic cells are grown on a “ThinCert” membrane and exposed against different metal(loid) organic compounds in a new designed exposition system. The results showed that dimethylmercury was most toxic to all three used cell lines followed by dimethylarsenic iodide. Tetramethyltin was the least toxic compound; and the toxicity was also dependent upon the cell type. Human colon cells (CaCo) were most susceptible to the toxicity of the volatile compounds compared to the other cell lines. However, volatile metal(loid) compounds can be toxic to mammalian cells already at very low concentrations but the toxicity depends upon the metal(loid) species and the exposed cell type. Furthermore, the toxicity also depends on the uptake speed and the intracellular biotransformation. In particular for arsenic, MMA(III) (monomethylarsonous acid) is one of the most important metabolites. Based on previous experiences time-resolved biotransformation of MMA(III) in hepatoma cells and speciation in the cell residues where performed by HPLC/ICP-MS. As a result of the speciation analysis it can be concluded that MMA(III) is immediately taken up and rapidly bound to proteins and other cellular structures, first followed by the generally accepted methylation to DMA, and in a second step by the degradation of affected proteins and cellular structures in the lysosome. Because of the comparison of the relation of mono- und dimethylated arsenic in the lysates and the cell residues it can be assumed that the methylation takes place in the cells, the methylated species are staying in the cell and are only slowly excreted.

A lever system with the pivot on one end and a 10 -pound dummy head on the other was used to simulate impact. The head was initially held at a 90 -degree angle from the floor before being released and allowed to hit the material resting on the ground. Head acceleration and position before, during, and after each impact was recorded and graphed for comparison using an accelerometer attached to the head.
