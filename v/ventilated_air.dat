Air is passed through an [...] "enthalpy wheel" [...] (often using silica gel) {{to reduce the}} cost of heating <b>ventilated</b> <b>air</b> in the winter by transferring heat from the warm inside air being exhausted to the fresh (but cold) supply air. In the summer, the inside air cools the warmer incoming supply air to reduce ventilation cooling costs.

50|$|In {{addition}} to durability and expense, Wright incorporated {{such factors as}} thermal comfort into the design. First, he indicated that concrete construction would keep the house cooler {{in the summer and}} warmer in the winter. Concrete walls have greater thermal mass than walls of wood, and thereby lessen temperature fluctuations during the day and throughout the year. Furthermore, the roof overhang would have reduced overheating by shading part of the walls in summer. A third feature was perhaps the most innovative: Wright specified that the ceilings for the second floor rooms be installed eight inches below the roof slab. The resulting air space was to be fed by vents beneath the eaves and exhausted through the chimney to create a constant stream of moving air. Modern homes often use a similar soffit and ridge vent combination to keep the attic and the floor below cooler. Yet, at the time of publication, most wood houses lacked attic ventilation because buildings were not constructed as tightly as those built in recent years. The monolithic construction of the Fireproof House would have prevented most natural air infiltration, making the <b>ventilated</b> <b>air</b> space a necessity.|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{external}} insulation facade systems and particularly rainscreen and external thermal insulation composite systems (ETICS) become very popular. Each of mentioned systems {{has a number}} of advantages and certain disadvantages due to which the problem of durability and efficiency of {{external insulation}} facade systems remains actual. One of the methods to solve this problem is to provide traditional external thermal insulation composite systems with the <b>ventilated</b> <b>air</b> gap presented by innovative material – ventilated façade mat Stuccodrain. Influence of air permeability of provided <b>ventilated</b> <b>air</b> gap in ETICS on moisture conditions of the wall structure has been considered in this work. The method of calculation of such an influence is based upon the comparative evaluation of non-stationary humidity conditions of ETICS and humidity conditions of ETICS with the <b>ventilated</b> <b>air</b> gap. The results of the comparative evaluation show that humidity of render layer in case of ETICS provided with <b>ventilated</b> <b>air</b> gap reduces significantly in comparison with traditional ETICS. Humidity reduction in external render layer of structure raises the durability and keeps the efficiency of the structure during the exploitation period.
