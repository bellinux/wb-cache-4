Summary: “The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to give an approximate formula involving two terms for the basic reproduction number R 0 of a vector-borne disease when the <b>vector</b> <b>population</b> has small seasonal fluctuations of the form p(t) = p 0 (1 + ε cos(ωt − ϕ)) with ε ≪ 1.

The maximum correction due to the second term is (ε 2 / 8) % and always tends to decrease R 0. The basic reproduction number R 0 is defined through the spectral radius of a linear integral operator. Four numerical methods for the computation of R 0 are compared using as example a model for the 2005 / 2006 chikungunya epidemic in La Réunion.

40|$|AbstractThe {{preventive}} measures against malaria {{recommended by the}} WHO include anti-vector procedures such as indoor residual spraying, the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed-nets, {{and the destruction of}} larval breeding sites. The presence of insecticide-treated materials inside the mosquito habitat has consequences for the <b>vector's</b> <b>population,</b> reducing density, survival, contact with humans, and feeding frequency. However, the effectiveness of these tools is being challenged by the emergence of insecticide resistance. The evolution of resistance to insecticides in Anopheles threatens to thwart the goal of decreasing malaria transmission, in an arms race between malaria control programmes and the <b>vector</b> <b>populations.</b> Multiple mechanisms of resistance to insecticides have been observed in Anopheles populations, including target site mutation (knockdown resistance), increased metabolic detoxification, and remarkable behavioural adaptation. These disturbing observations all show the capacity of Anopheles to adapt to and circumvent strategies aimed at reducing malaria transmission. Thus, by using nets to protect ourselves, are we providing Anopheles with the entire arsenal needed to hit much harder...|$|R
40|$|Regular {{monitoring}} of mosquito <b>vector</b> <b>populations</b> {{is an integral}} component of most vector control programmes. Contemporary data on mosquito species composition, infection status, and resistance to insecticides are a prerequisite for effective intervention. For this purpose we, with funding from the Innovative Vector Control Consortium (IVCC), have developed a suite of high-throughput assays based on a single “closed-tube” platform that collectively comprise the “Vector Population Monitoring Tool” (VPMT). The VPMT {{can be used to}} screen mosquito disease <b>vector</b> <b>populations</b> for a number of traits including Anopheles gambiae s. l. and Anopheles funestus species identification, detection of infection with Plasmodium parasites, and identification of insecticide resistance mechanisms.

40|$|There has {{recently}} been a substantial decline in malaria incidence in much of Africa. While the decline can clearly be linked to increasing coverage of mosquito vector control interventions and effective drug treatment in most settings, the ubiquity of reduction {{raises the possibility that}} additional ecological and associated evolutionary changes may be reinforcing the effectiveness of current vector control strategies in previously unanticipated ways. Here it is hypothesized that the increasing coverage of insecticide-treated bed nets and other vector control methods may be driving selection for a shift in mosquito life history that reduces their ability to transmit malaria parasites. Specifically it is hypothesized that by substantially increasing the extrinsic rate of mortality experienced in <b>vector</b> <b>populations,</b> these interventions are creating a fitness incentive for mosquitoes to re-allocate their resources towards greater short-term reproduction at the expense of longer-term survival. As malaria transmission is fundamentally dependent on mosquito survival, a life history shift in this direction would greatly benefit control. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: At present, direct evaluation of this hypothesis within natural <b>vector</b> <b>populations</b> presents several logistical and methodological challenges. In the meantime, many insights can be gained from research previously conducted on wild Drosophila populations. Long-term selection experiments on these organisms suggest that increasing extrinsic mortality by a magnitude similar to that anticipated from the up-scaling of vector control measures generated an increase in their intrinsic mortality rate. Although this increase was small, a change of similar magnitude in Anopheles <b>vector</b> <b>populations</b> would be predicted to reduce malaria transmission by 80...|$|R
