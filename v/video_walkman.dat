50|$|The Sony GV-8 <b>Video</b> <b>Walkman</b> was {{introduced}} in 1989. It played Video 8 format tape cassettes, showing them on a 3 in diagonal color screen. The GV-8 included a TV receiver for VHF and UHF channels. It measured 5 x 8 x 2+1/2 in and weighed 2.5 lb. The rechargeable battery lasted from 45 minutes to one hour depending on usage.|$|E
50|$|The Sony NW-A80x, is {{a series}} of network enabled <b>video</b> <b>Walkman</b> players, {{announced}} late 2006 and released on 19 May 2007.On 19 May 2007, only the NW-A806 (4 GB) and the NW-A808 (8 GB) model were released. On 13 June 2007, Sony announced that the NW-A800 (2 GB) would be included in the series and soon be available to the public.|$|E
50|$|The {{future of}} the Digital 8 format is in question. , Sony, the format's {{original}} backer, was the only company still producing Digital8 equipment, and {{had no plans to}} develop new Digital 8 cameras. Hitachi marketed a few Digital8 camcorders for a while but no longer did so by that point. As of 2005 and later, the Digital8 product line caters purely to the entry-level consumer. This is most likely because the larger, bulkier Digital8 cassette is perceived as an inferior technology, even though the Digital8 and DV formats offer indistinguishable A/V performance. In fact, the larger 8mm format is more robust, laying down wider tracks. Most, though not all, Digital8 camcorders can play back analogue Video8 and Hi8 tapes. As well as camcorders, Sony also released Digital8 <b>Video</b> <b>Walkman</b> Portables, the GV-D200 and GV-D800.|$|E
50|$|<b>Walkman</b> <b>Video</b> MP3 Player {{combined}} the music playback capability of current Walkman MP3 Player line with video. Sony decided to choose Memory Stick Video format (which {{is actually the}} H.264/MPEG-4 AVC format) as standard for <b>Walkman</b> MP3 <b>Video</b> Player.|$|R
30|$|The {{volunteers were}} {{evaluated}} in a supine, 30 ° head-up position. Room temperature was kept between 19 °C and 22 °C. Demographic data (age, gender, weight, and length), blood pressure, {{and heart rate}} were recorded. Blood pressure was measured noninvasively, and heart rate was recorded by plethysmography. The microvascular measurements were obtained as a single measurement in the sublingual mucosa in three different areas with SDF and Cytocam-IDF imaging without special preparation of the mouth. The probe was handheld and adjusted by experienced operators (GA and GV) to obtain optimal image quality. With the SDF technique, after adequate focus and contrast adjustment, steady images of at least 15 s were acquired and recorded on a digital videotape (Sony <b>Video</b> <b>Walkman</b> GV-D 1000 E; Sony, Tokyo, Japan), which digitizes the analogue SDF images prior to video storage. The images were captured in representative AVI format video clips (SonyDVgate; Sony, Tokyo, Japan) to allow off-line computerized image analysis using specialized software we had previously developed for this purpose [20].|$|E
