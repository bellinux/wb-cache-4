5|$|On 9 August 1920, a {{passenger}} train {{collided with the}} buffers. Two people were injured. The following year, {{a passenger}} train was being shunted into a platform and collided with three luggage vans already occupying the line. A carriage was derailed and a luggage <b>van</b> <b>was</b> wrecked.|$|E
5|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the gas station, the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove in, the <b>van</b> <b>was</b> actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate any sound from the vehicle. However, every time the <b>van</b> <b>was</b> pushed it would stall or the timing would be off. Once that problem had been solved, it started to rain, but eventually it stopped and the crew {{was able to get}} the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where the hatch had been constructed. After each take of Hurley eating food in the hatch, the old food would be replaced with newer food. Garcia did not actually eat all the food though, he would sometimes just chew it and then spit it out into a garbage can. The chicken head that Bose had to wear was extremely heavy, causing actor Daniel Dae Kim to have to hold it up while Bose delivered his lines.|$|E
5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford <b>van</b> <b>was</b> {{parked on}} Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and sunglasses – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked {{them up in the}} Ford Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E
5000|$|... 5. Shuttle Vans - Shuttle <b>vans</b> <b>are</b> {{very similar}} to {{traveling}} vans, but with a different purpose and with a different seat configuration. While traveling <b>vans</b> <b>are</b> used by families, shuttle <b>vans</b> <b>are</b> usually used by businesses. These <b>vans</b> <b>are</b> traditionally used for taxis, school buses, limousines, airport buses, and for law enforcement.|$|R

50|$|Based on the {{previous}} VHX design, between 1972 and 1976 a further 250 <b>vans</b> <b>were</b> built. The <b>vans</b> <b>were</b> slightly different from the VHX type, with additional strengthening 'ribs' added between the louvre groups on the sides.

5|$|In April, Turner {{wrote in}} a self-congratulatory tone to Himmler's {{personal}} staff officer, SS-Obergruppenführer Karl Wolff, stating that he had already had all the available Jewish men killed and all {{the women and children}} placed in the Sajmište concentration camp. He went on to claim that he had arranged, {{with the help of the}} SD, a gas van to clear the camp in a period of a fortnight to four weeks. Holocaust historian Christopher Browning considers this claim suspect, stating that Turner's reports about Jewish affairs were often inaccurate and self-serving in an attempt to ingratiate himself with Hitler and shore up his position. Browning's view is that a <b>van</b> <b>was</b> dispatched after regular requests from Belgrade for the remaining Jews to be deported directly, so that the local authorities could resolve the matter themselves. When the van arrived in Belgrade, Meyszner was kept informed, and Schäfer asked him for directions.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to trace {{the route of the}} Ford van, police {{examined}} CCTV footage from every major road and motorway taken in England within two days of the bombing. Footage revealed that the <b>van</b> <b>was</b> driven south along the M1 motorway into London on the Friday afternoon before the attack. It was seen again heading north along the motorway at 7:40pm, accompanied by the Ford Granada. Detectives surmised that the van had been loaded with explosives in London and that the Granada was intended to be the getaway vehicle. The truck was last recorded travelling east along the M62 motorway towards Manchester at 8:31am {{on the morning of the}} explosion.|$|E
5|$|On April 22, 1992, {{less than}} a year after her kidnapping, a man called the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department from a gas station less than two miles from the Garridos' home. The caller {{reported}} that he saw Dugard in the gas station staring intently at a missing child poster of herself. The caller then reported seeing her leave in a large yellow van, possibly a Dodge. In 2009, after Dugard's release, an old yellow Dodge <b>van</b> <b>was</b> recovered from the Garrido property that matched the description of the van given in the call. The license plate was not reported in the 1992 call; the caller, the girl, and the van were gone by the time police arrived. The caller never identified himself, and the police did not pursue the matter any further. In contradiction to this story, Dugard reported that she never left the Garrido property from the day she was kidnapped until shortly before her first child was born in August 1994.|$|E

5|$|The Renault Zoe was {{the best-selling}} all-{{electric}} car in Europe in 2016 with 21,735 units delivered, and also topped European {{sales in the}} broader plug-in electric car segment, ahead of the Outlander P-HEV, the top selling plug-in in the previous two years. The Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV with 21,446 units sold was the second best-selling plug-in car, followed by the Nissan Leaf with 18,718. The Outlander PHEV has been Europe's best-selling plug-in hybrid vehicle for four years in a row, from 2013 to 2016. The top selling all-electric commercial <b>van</b> <b>was</b> the Nissan e-NV200 with 4,319 units registered. , the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV is the all-time top selling plug-in electric car in the region with 80,768 units delivered, followed by the Nissan Leaf with 67,654 units, Renault Zoe with 60,625 units, Tesla Model S with 38,716, and the BMW i3 with 38,267 units. The Renault Kangoo Z.E. is the all-time top selling all-electric utility van with 24,917 units.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{followed}} in Vanguard, bringing {{the next two}} ships into action with the starboard side of the French van, catching the French ships in a crossfire that rapidly battered and dismasted the ships, despite determined defence. As the French <b>van</b> <b>was</b> destroyed, HMS Bellerophon and HMS Majestic attacked the French centre. Outnumbered and faced with the massed broadsides of Orient and the 80-gun Franklin and Tonnant, both British ships suffered massive damage. Culloden, {{bringing up the rear}} of the British line, passed too close to the northern shoal and grounded, Troubridge suffering severe damage to his hull despite efforts by Mutine and Leander to drag the ship off. By 19:00 darkness had fallen, and within an hour the French van had been defeated, Guerrier, Conquérant, Spartiate, Aquilon and Peuple Souverain all either in British hands or too badly damaged to continue fighting. The British too had suffered damage, with Vanguard and Goliath badly hit while to the south both Bellerophon and Majestic had been forced to cut their anchor cables and pull away from their respective opponents. Bellerophon had been dismasted, Majestics captain George Blagden Westcott had been killed, and on Vanguard Nelson had suffered a severe head wound.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} {{attack on}} Hammersmith Bridge encouraged the RIRA leadership to launch further attacks in Northern Ireland. On 19 June 2000 a bomb {{was found in}} the grounds of Hillsborough Castle, home of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Mandelson. On 30 June a bomb exploded on the Dublin-to-Belfast railway line near the village of Meigh in County Armagh. The explosion damaged the tracks, and caused disruption to train services. On 9 July a car bomb damaged buildings in Stewartstown, County Tyrone including an RUC station, and on 10 August an attack in Derry was thwarted by the RUC after a van containing a 500lb bomb failed to stop at a police checkpoint. Following a car chase the bombers escaped across the Irish border, and the Irish Army carried out a controlled explosion on the bomb after the <b>van</b> <b>was</b> found abandoned in County Donegal. On 13 September two 80lb bombs were planted at the Magilligan army camp in County Londonderry, one of which was planted in a wooden hut and partially exploded when a soldier {{opened the door to the}} hut. The second bomb was found during a follow-up search and made safe by bomb disposal experts. On 11 November the RUC and British Army prevented a mortar attack after stopping a van near Derrylin, County Fermanagh, and the RUC prevented a further attack on 13 January 2001 when an 1100lb bomb was found in Armagh — the largest bomb found in several years according to the RUC.|$|E

50|$|A final {{batch of}} <b>vans</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} in 1950-1951, {{this time with}} a steel frame and two axles, but also with panelled body sides in place of planks. These forty <b>vans</b> <b>were</b> numbered 707Z through 746Z.|$|R
5|$|The tornado {{touched down}} north of Section, {{initially}} producing EF0 to EF1 tree damage. The tornado rapidly intensified to low-end EF4 strength {{as it passed}} northwest of Pisgah and Rosalie, destroying numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes, scattering the debris hundreds of yards and killing three people. Thousands of trees were snapped and debarked, vehicles were thrown up to 50 yards in different directions, and multiple barns and chicken houses were heavily damaged, along with {{the roof of a}} church. As it passed near Flat Rock and Higdon, the tornado reached high-end EF4 strength, mowing down thousands of trees in this rural area. As the tornado struck a farm, a home and two chicken houses were completely obliterated and swept away. A heavy propane tank was lofted and thrown 100 yards from one of the chicken houses, and 19 cattle on the property were killed. Remarkably, a family of four taking shelter inside the house were completely unharmed. The tornado maintained EF4 strength as it tore through the rural community of Shiloh, sweeping away numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes and killing 5 people at that location. Thousands of trees were snapped, a log cabin was destroyed, livestock was killed, chicken houses were flattened, and a <b>van</b> <b>was</b> lofted and dropped into a field 400 yards away from where it originated. The tornado then crossed into Georgia and struck Trenton as an EF3, killing two people. Dozens of homes in Trenton were completely destroyed, 18 others sustained major damage, {{and tens of thousands of}} trees were downed in the area. A grocery store, two apartment complexes, and a funeral home were destroyed as well.|$|E
25|$|The cream-coloured <b>van</b> <b>was</b> spotted on 22 March by a {{helicopter}} patrol, {{but before the}} area could be secured {{for the police to}} investigate it, the <b>van</b> <b>was</b> destroyed by fire. It was found that it had been stolen from a church car park on 18 March. Although the Provisional IRA claimed responsibility for carrying out the attack, nobody has ever been charged with the killings.|$|E

50|$|Four UB <b>vans</b> <b>were</b> recoded to UF during 1961. They {{were placed}} on cast bogies capable of higher speeds, a result of {{internal}} springing that reduced vibrations. The four <b>vans</b> <b>were</b> 15, 17, 53 and 55.|$|R
50|$|The new large <b>vans</b> <b>were</b> {{constructed}} {{very much}} like the soon-to-be-constructed VLF/X louvre vans, with curved roofs. The main difference was the pressed sheet-metal sides, rather than louvred sections. The <b>vans</b> <b>were</b> fitted with plain-bearing bogies.|$|R
50|$|The <b>vans</b> <b>were</b> {{scrapped}} as more bogie louvre <b>vans</b> <b>were</b> {{built with}} numbers progressively scrapped towards the late 1970s. Many had bodies removed and sold with the underframes being converted to KAB and KMQ flat wagons.|$|R

25|$|The sedan {{models were}} {{available}} in L, XL (later renamed GL) and Ghia forms, and a Sport pack option– similar to the 1300 and 1600 Sport models sold elsewhere. Unlike other markets– likely due to the estate's absence– the <b>van</b> <b>was</b> offered in {{a higher level of}} trim – a GL, and a Sport pack <b>van</b> <b>was</b> also available. Unusual fitments for the range not offered elsewhere on the Australian Escort included 'dog-dish' steel hubcaps, and high-backed front seats.|$|E
25|$|The three INLA men {{rushed through}} the {{turnstile}} leading to A wing's exercise yard. Peeling away a pre-cut section of wire fence, they {{climbed onto the}} roof of A wing and dropped into the forecourt where the Renault van containing Wright had just started to move forward towards the exit gates. The <b>van</b> <b>was</b> ordered to stop by the armed INLA men, however, the driver, John Park, thinking {{that he and the}} other officer were about to be taken hostage, intended to accelerate through the partially opened gates in a bid to escape. He was prevented from doing so when the gates were automatically shut. The other prison officers stationed at the forecourt gates had spotted the men on the roof, and assuming there was a prison escape in progress, activated the alarm system. The <b>van</b> <b>was</b> ten feet away from the gates when it came to a halt. Neither of the two prison officers inside the <b>van</b> <b>was</b> armed.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>vans</b> <b>were</b> weighed 12 LT, {{and were}} {{intended}} to have a mansard-style roof. However, this was altered to the constant-radius design before construction began. The <b>vans</b> <b>were</b> kept cool by their insulation, {{as well as a}} 2 ft deep well suspended from the roof of the wagon, which was filled with salted, crushed ice at Melbourne Yard on a regular basis (What a Journey - Tom Yates). 191 <b>vans</b> <b>were</b> constructed of this type. The <b>vans</b> <b>were</b> painted in standard VR wagon red, but their roofs were in a lighter brown; this was probably to make them stand out in consists when being viewed from above.|$|R
50|$|Nanny <b>vans</b> <b>were</b> {{originally}} a small van operated in Hong Kong to ferry pre-school {{children from their}} homes to their nurseries and kindergartens. Most of these <b>vans</b> <b>were</b> run by private agreement between the schools and the drivers. These original nanny vans seated four to five adults; other seats in the <b>van</b> <b>were</b> removed and replaced with a narrow sofa around the cabin. With such an arrangement, the van could transport 10-12 children.|$|R
50|$|The goods brake <b>van</b> <b>is</b> less attractive, is {{generally}} the last vehicle on the train, open on both sides, {{and does not}} necessarily have interior lighting/lamps, but it does house a small WC lavatory seat for the guards, owing to their long hours on freight trains.

25|$|The 40hp {{engine and}} chassis {{used with the}} {{double-decker}} bus was also used with lorries and drays, while a half-ton delivery <b>van</b> <b>was</b> based on a 12hp chassis similar to a car chassis.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{railroad}} car design, {{the brake}} <b>van,</b> <b>was</b> used on British and Commonwealth railways.
