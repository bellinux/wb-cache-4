2500|$|Despite {{the large}} number of union elections, CALRA's effect on union {{membership}} seems mixed at best. Much of this evidence focuses on the UFW, assumed to be the prime beneficiary of the Act. Membership in the UFW fell from a high of more than 70,000-60,000 in 1972 to a low of 6,000-5,000 in 1974, but rose to just 18,000 by 1977. The Teamsters, however, had more than 55,000 farm worker members by 1977. The UFW had only six major collective bargaining agreements by 1994 (one <b>vegetable</b> <b>grower,</b> four citrus growers, one mushroom grower, and a host of small nurseries). However, one study concludes that mass importation and use of illegal immigrants—not flaws in CALRA—are holding down additional collective bargaining gains. Others conclude (on the basis of anecdotal evidence) that the Teamsters have signed sweetheart deals with perhaps as many as 375 growers, holding down membership gains for the UFW. Others criticize the ALRB for being politicized. [...] Critics point to the change in the Board in 1980, when George Deukmejian, the new Republican governor of California, replaced the Brown board with allegedly pro-grower members, leading to low union confidence in the Board's impartiality and a severe {{decline in the number of}} election petitions brought before the board.|$|E

A factorial arrangement in a randomized complete block design of three surface tillage treatments (chisel/disk/level, disk/level, no surface tillage) and three deep tillage treatments (no deep tillage, in-row subsoiling, paratill) with four replications were administered to plots planted to ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) cv. ‘Marshall ’ each fall. Winter annual grazing generated an average net income over the 3 yr period of $ 268. 75 ac- 1 minus labor. Both surface tillage treatments were superior to no surface tillage each year. In-row subsoiling produced higher fresh corn ear weights in 2001, while both deep tillage treatments produced higher yields than no deep tillage in 2003. Leaf temperatures differences of less than 2 F ° were observed between surface and deep tillage treatments in 2001 and 2002.
