25|$|In 2008, Zimbardo {{began working}} with Sarah Brunskill and Anthony Ferreras on a new theory called the social {{intensity}} syndrome (SIS). SIS is a new term coined to describe and normalize the effects military culture has on the socialization of both active soldiers and veterans. Zimbardo and Brunskill presented the new theory and a preliminary factor analysis of it accompanying survey at the Western Psychological Association in 2013. Brunskill finished the data collection in December 2013. Through an exploratory component factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency and <b>validity</b> <b>tests</b> demonstrated that SIS was a reliable and valid construct of measuring military socialization. Fifty-eight items were deemed viable and six factors were identified; military friends (16 items), family (11 items), gender social preference (7 items), social bonding (11 items), nostalgia (9 items) and drug use (4 items). Identifying and standardizing SIS was the first step, further research has identified that 4 demographic categories within the military; active and have been deployed (AD), active and never been deployed (AND), inactive and have been deployed (ID) and inactive and never been deployed (IND). These are important categories to better understand how service members are affected leaving the military.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Shieffield Peer Review Assessment (SPRAT) is an {{instrument}} to assess medical student’s performance using Multi Source Feedback (MSF) method. The previous study stated that MSF with SPRAT is an effective tool assessing professional behaviour (PB) of nursing students both in clinical setting and community setting. However it needs more items to be added. Based on that explanation, it needs conducting <b>validity</b> and reliability <b>test</b> {{to make sure that}} the tool is valid and reliable. Method: There were two types of <b>validity</b> <b>test</b> used, content <b>validity</b> <b>test</b> and construct <b>validity</b> <b>test</b> as well as reliability test, namely inter-rater reliability test and item covariance test. Participants were four clinical instructors and 116 nursing students. Result: Content <b>validity</b> <b>test</b> showed that two items must be added as part of assessment item, namely diciplines and faithness. Furthermore construct <b>validity</b> <b>test</b> showed that five items were not valid since they had pearson correlation score < 0. 3. However the items were included as consideration of nursing students’s PB. Inter-rater reliability test and item covariance reliability test showed that the tool was reliable with score 0. 460 and 0. 912 respectively. Discussion: The assessment tool can be applied to assess PB of nursing students since it valid and reliable. It needs to investigate the effectiveness of the tool in difference of PB of nursing students. Keywords: validity, reliability, assessment tool of PB (professional behaviour...|$|R

None of his theorizations were accomplished {{without him}} questioning, without complacency or self-indulgence his own epistemological assumptions. As soon as 1961, he questioned {{the validity of}} case-based descriptive models by opposing them to normative models. He asserted successfully that external validity of case-based models should not be assessed with external <b>validity</b> <b>tests</b> designed for normative models. To the replication of results, he opposed the purpose-related sufficiency of tests.

50|$|In {{terms of}} their {{education}} and training, psychologists {{need to be able}} to address the full array of areas under discussion, especially in forensic, rehabilitation, and trauma areas. They must become experts in assessment and testing, especially regarding (a) personality tests (e.g., the MMPI-2; Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989; Butcher, Graham, Ben-Porath, Tellegen, Dahlstrom, & Kaemmer, 2001; and the revision the MMPI-2 RF; Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008; as well as the PAI; Morey, 2007), and their embedded validity scales, such as the F family of scales in the MMPI tests, and (b) stand-alone symptom <b>validity</b> <b>tests</b> (e.g., the TOMM; Tombaugh, 1996; WMT; Green, 2005; SIRS; Rogers, Bagby, & Dickens, 1992; and the revision SIRS-2; Rogers, Sewell, & Gillard, 2010). The key factors in the development of tests that are acceptable to psychologists and to court is that the tests should have acceptable psychometric properties, such as reliability and validity. Also, such tests must be standardized by using populations that make sense for the area of psychological injuries, such as accident survivors experiencing pain and other trauma victims.|$|E

50|$|Convergent and {{discriminant}} validity {{are the two}} subtypes of validity that make up construct validity. Convergent validity refers to {{the degree to which}} two measures of constructs that theoretically should be related, are in fact related. In contrast discriminant <b>validity</b> <b>tests</b> whether concepts or measurements that are supposed to be unrelated are, in fact, unrelated. Take, for example, a construct of general happiness. If a measure of general happiness had convergent validity, then constructs similar to happiness (satisfaction, contentment, cheerfulness, etc.) should relate closely to the measure of general happiness. If this measure has discriminate validity, then constructs that are not supposed to be related to general happiness (sadness, depression, despair, etc.) should not relate to the measure of general happiness. Measures can have one of the subtypes of construct validity and not the other. Using the example of general happiness, a researcher could create an inventory where there is a very high correlation between general happiness and contentment, but if there is also a significant correlation between happiness and depression, then the measure's construct validity is called into question. The test has convergent validity but not {{discriminant validity}}.|$|E

5000|$|MADIS {{uses this}} current three-pronged {{approach}} for its quality control tests. They are organized into three {{different levels of}} checks.

Once this has happened the station will continue to fail until it improves to failing only 25% of the time. The spatial check for the MADIS program also uses a reanalysis procedure: If there is a large difference between the station being checked and the station that it is being checked against, then one of them is wrong. Instead of assuming that the station being checked is wrong, the program then moves on to the other stations that are near the one being checked. If the station that is being checked still is way off compared to most of the stations surrounding it then it is flagged as bad. However if the station is close to all of the other ones except for one then that one is assumed bad.|$|E

Most of the previous works deal with a proper choice of error measures to guide the simplification. Preserving the topological characteristics of the mesh and possibly of data attached to the mesh is a more recent topic, the present paper is about. We introduce a new topology preserving simplification algorithm for triangular meshes, possibly non-manifold, with embedded polylines. In this context embedded means that {{the edges of the}} polylines are also edges of the mesh. The paper introduces a robust test to detect if the collapse of an edge in the mesh modifies either the topology of the mesh or the topology of the embedded polylines. This <b>validity</b> <b>test</b> is derived using combinatorial topology results. More precisely we define a so-called extended complex from the input mesh and the embedded polylines.

Our <b>validity</b> <b>test</b> can be used for any 2 -complex mesh, including non-manifold triangular meshes. It can be combined with any previously introduced error measure.
