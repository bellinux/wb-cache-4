The effect of this noise on the neuronal performance has been modelled using either approximate or Langevin model, based on stochastic differential equations or an exact model, based on a Markov process model of channel gating. Yet whether the Langevin model accurately reproduces the channel noise produced by the Markov model remains unclear. Here we present a comparison between Langevin and Markov models of channel noise in neurons using single compartment Hodgkin-Huxley models containing either $Na^{+}$ and $K^{+}$, or only $K^{+}$ <b>voltage-gated</b> <b>ion</b> <b>channels.</b> The performance of the Langevin and Markov models was quantified over a range of stimulus statistics, membrane areas and channel numbers. We find that {{in comparison to the}} Markov model, the Langevin model underestimates the noise contributed by <b>voltage-gated</b> <b>ion</b> <b>channels,</b> overestimating information rates for both spiking and non-spiking membranes. Even with increasing numbers of channels {{the difference between the two}} models persists.

Recent studies suggest that their behavior can depend strongly on the membrane lipid composition and physical state. In vivo studies of membrane/channel and channel/channel interactions are challenging as membrane properties are actively regulated in living cells, and are difficult to control in experimental settings. We developed a method to reconstitute functional <b>voltage-gated</b> <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> into cell-sized Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) in which membrane composition, tension and geometry can be controlled. First, a voltage-gated potassium channel, KvAP, was purified, fluorescently labeled and reconstituted into small proteoliposomes. Small proteoliposomes were then converted into GUVs via electroformation. GUVs could be formed using different lipid compositions and buffers containing low (5 mM) or near-physiological (100 mM) salt concentrations. Protein incorporation into GUVs was characterized with quantitative confocal microscopy, and the protein density of GUVs was comparable to the small proteoliposomes from which they were formed. Furthermore, patch-clamp measurements confirmed that the reconstituted channels retained potassium selectivity and voltage-gated activation.

40|$|Spider peptide toxins have {{attracted}} attention {{because of their}} ability to target <b>voltage-gated</b> <b>ion</b> <b>channels,</b> which are involved in several pathologies including chronic pain and some cardiovascular conditions. A class of these peptides acts by modulating the gating mechanism of <b>voltage-gated</b> <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> and are thus called gating modifier toxins (GMTs). In addition to their interactions with <b>voltage-gated</b> <b>ion</b> <b>channels,</b> some GMTs have affinity for lipid bilayers. This review discusses the potential importance of the cell membrane on the mode of action of GMTs.

We also propose that modulating peptideâmembrane interactions might be useful for increasing the therapeutic potential of spider toxins. Furthermore, we explore the advantages and limitations of the methodologies currently used to examine peptideâmembrane interactions.
