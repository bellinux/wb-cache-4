5000|$|Kennedy <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> {{emphasized}} <b>that</b> his specific {{usage of}} the term [...] "nocebo" [...] did not refer to [...] "the iatrogenic action of drugs": in other words, according to Kennedy, {{there was no such}} thing as a [...] "nocebo effect", there was only a [...] "nocebo response".|$|R

500|$|Dmowski had a scientist's {{background}} and thus preferred logic and reason over emotion and passion. He once told famous pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski that music was [...] "mere noise". Dmowski felt <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> Poles should abandon {{what he considered}} to be foolish romantic nationalism and useless gestures of defiance and should instead work hard at becoming businessmen and scientists. Dmowski was very much influenced by Social Darwinist theories, then popular in the Western world, and saw life as a merciless struggle between [...] "strong" [...] nations who dominated and [...] "weak" [...] nations who were dominated.|$|E
500|$|In January 1967, John Larson {{began work}} with Bánáthy and Bob Perin {{to write a}} new Wood Badge staff guide {{focusing}} on leadership. Ken Wells and Perin {{had participated in the}} second United States Wood Badge course in 1948. Despite their long experience with Wood Badge, they saw the benefit of adding leadership skills development to its requirements. William [...] "Green Bar" [...] Hillcourt, Scoutmaster of the first U.S. Wood Badge course in 1948, felt <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> the traditional teaching of Scoutcraft skills should be retained. Hillcourt had recently formally retired, but his opinion held considerable weight. Chief Scout Joseph Brunton approved the changes.|$|E
500|$|According to Ronald D. Moore, Roddenberry [...] "felt <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> {{contemporary}} Earth religions {{would be}} gone by the 23rd century". Brannon Braga said that Roddenberry made it known to the writers of Star Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation that religion, superstition, and mystical thinking {{were not to be}} included. Even a mention of marriage in a script for an early episode of The Next Generation resulted in Roddenberry's chastising the writers. Nicholas Meyer said that Star Trek had evolved [...] "into sort of a secular parallel to the Catholic Mass". Roddenberry compared the franchise to his own philosophy by saying: [...] "Understand that Star Trek is more than just my political philosophy, my racial philosophy, my overview on life and the human condition." [...] He was awarded the 1991 Humanist Arts Award from the American Humanist Association.|$|E

However, if (as is likely) this is a spurious hypothesis, this result will most likely not be reproducible; any attempt to check if others with an August 7 birthday have a similar rate of changing minors will most likely get contradictory results almost immediately.|$|R
500|$|In 1983, Keneally {{was hired}} to adapt his book, and he turned in a 220-page script. His {{adaptation}} focused on Schindler's numerous relationships, and Keneally admitted he did not compress the story enough. Spielberg hired Kurt Luedtke, who had adapted the screenplay of Out of Africa, to write the next draft. Luedtke gave up almost four years later, as he found Schindler's change of heart too unbelievable. During his time as director, Scorsese hired Steven Zaillian to write a script. When he was handed back the project, Spielberg found Zaillian's 115-page draft too short, {{and asked him to}} extend it to 195 pages. Spielberg wanted more focus on the Jews in the story, and he wanted Schindler's transition to be gradual and ambiguous, not a sudden breakthrough or epiphany. He extended the ghetto liquidation sequence, as he [...] "felt <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> the sequence had to be almost unwatchable." ...|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt was {{impressed}} by some models Saint-Gaudens had prepared for the cent showing a head of Liberty. [...] In early 1907, he wrote to Saint-Gaudens proposing that a Native American or Indian headdress {{be added to the}} obverse of the cent: [...] "I feel <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> on at least one coin we ought to have the Indian feather headdress. [...] It is distinctly American, and very picturesque. [...] Couldn't you have just such a head as you have now, but with the feather headdress?" [...] Numismatic historian Walter Breen described this as [...] "the absurd addition of a feathered warbonnet, such as neither Ms. Liberty nor any Native American woman would ever have worn". [...] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that the Indian Head eagle [...] "missed being a great coin because Roosevelt interfered with the choice of headdress (or no headdress) for Liberty".|$|E

"I've made a {{commitment}} to a great number of volunteers ... people who've gone out on cold days and circulated petitions, raised funds on my behalf and after talking to them, they feel <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> we're talking about the right issues.

2500|$|Although {{his last}} {{recorded}} first-class match was in 1821 (aged 55), {{there is strong}} anecdotal evidence that he continued to play to a very advanced age, for in his Oxford Memories, Pycroft stated [...] "Beldham's was a green old age.

40|$|The {{familiar}} Newtonian {{version of}} the Rayleigh criterion demands that for dynamical stability the specific angular momentum should increase with the increasing circumferential radius of circular trajectories of matter. However, sufficiently close to a black hole the Rayleigh criterion reverses: in stable fluids, the angular momentum must decrease with the increasing circumferential radius. The geometrical reason for this reversal is that the space is so <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> warped <b>that</b> it turns inside-out. Comment: 9 page...|$|R

2500|$|Alvin's {{funeral was}} held at the Presbyterian church. According to an 1893 account by his brother William, [...] "Rev. Stockton had preached my brother's funeral sermon and intimated <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> he had gone to hell, for Alvin was not a church member". William cites this as a reason that Joseph Sr. would not join the Presbyterians.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the episode}} Kurelek was invited back as an {{inpatient}} {{to be treated}} by a different doctor, Dr. Carstairs, who appears in the film William Kurelek's The Maze. Carstairs provided Kurelek with a room that doubled as a studio where he could paint. Kurelek felt <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> he had to justify his being there for the doctors, so he commenced painting The Maze, [...] "depicting all [...] psychic problems in a neat package." ...|$|E
2500|$|The UK's Flying Saucer Working Party {{published}} {{its final}} report in June 1951, which remained secret for over 50 years. The Working Party concluded that all UFO sightings {{could be explained}} as misidentifications of ordinary objects or phenomena, optical illusions, psychological misperceptions/aberrations, or hoaxes. The report stated: [...] "We accordingly recommend <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> no further investigation of reported mysterious aerial phenomena be undertaken, unless and until some material evidence becomes available." ...|$|E

We finished <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> and <b>that’s</b> always pleasing, We’ve done that {{in the last couple of}} games. We can be very happy with our finish anyway." ...|$|R

2500|$|There are two overall {{forms of}} synesthesia: {{projective}} synesthesia and associative synesthesia. People who project will see actual colors, forms, or shapes when stimulated, as is commonly accepted as synesthesia; associators will feel {{a very strong}} and involuntary connection between the stimulus and {{the sense that it}} triggers. For example, in the common form chromesthesia (sound to color) a projector may hear a trumpet and see an orange triangle in space while an associator might hear a trumpet and think <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> it sounds [...] "orange".|$|E

I will say that I support human rights... And of course that includes sexual orientation. On the other hand, I've felt <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> it wasn't government's responsibility to give proclamations for people's sexuality. I don't think government {{has a responsibility to}} issue awards for one's sexuality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brodsky {{attributes}} her 47 {{years as}} a clinical social worker as a partial inspiration for her writing. In an interview with author Rebecca Rule, Brodsky said the stories her clients have told her [...] "often reveal great courage, inner strength and joy." [...] Brodsky said she has witnessed the human struggle to [...] "overcome personal difficulties that started in childhood." [...] "My books for children have messages in them that come from my social work experience...differences, friendship, loyalty, and social action," [...] Brodsky told journalist Michael Cousineau in a 2008 interview in the New Hampshire Sunday News.

60|$|As I {{have said}} already, Johnston was at Dalton, which was nearly {{one-fourth of the}} way between Chattanooga and Atlanta. The country is {{mountain}}ous {{all the way to}} Atlanta, abounding in mountain streams, some of them of considerable volume. Dalton is on ground where water drains towards Atlanta and into one of the main streams rising north-east from there and flowing south-west--this being the general direction which all the main streams of that section take, with smaller tributaries entering into them. Johnston had been preparing himself for this campaign during the entire winter. The best positions for defence had been selected all the way from Dalton back to Atlanta, and <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> intrenched; so <b>that,</b> as he might be forced to fall back from one position, he would have another to fall into in his rear. His position at Dalton was so <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> intrenched <b>that</b> no doubt he expected, or at least hoped, to hold Sherman there and prevent him from getting any further. With a less skilful general, and one disposed to take no risks, I have no doubt that he would have succeeded.|$|R

2500|$|After the American Revolutionary War, Quaker and Moravian advocates helped persuade {{numerous}} slaveholders in the Upper South to free their slaves. [...] Theodore Weld, {{an evangelical}} minister, and Robert Purvis, a free African American, joined Garrison in 1833 {{to form the}} Anti-Slavery Society (Faragher 381). The following year Weld encouraged {{a group of students}} at Lane Theological Seminary to form an anti-slavery society. After the president, Lyman Beecher, attempted to suppress it, the students moved to Oberlin College. Due to the students' anti-slavery position, Oberlin soon {{became one of the most}} liberal colleges and accepted African American students. Along with Garrison, were Northcutt and Collins as proponents of immediate abolition. These two ardent abolitionists felt <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> it could not wait and that action needed to be taken right away.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{controversial}} National Recovery Administration (NRA), the League was ambivalent. Jouett Shouse, the League president commented that [...] "the NRA has indulged in unwarranted excesses of attempted regulation"; on the other, {{he added that}} [...] "in many regards [...] has served a useful purpose." [...] Shouse {{said that he had}} [...] "deep sympathy" [...] with the goals of the NRA, explaining, [...] "While I feel <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> the prohibition of child labor, the maintenance of a minimum wage and the limitation of the hours of work belong under our form of government {{in the realm of the}} affairs of the different states, yet I am entirely willing to agree that in the case of an overwhelming national emergency the Federal Government for a limited period should be permitted to assume jurisdiction of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pilot Guy Henderson's fiancée, Lorne Blyth, {{strongly}} endorsed {{two of the}} AAIB's recommendations {{when the}} accident report was published, saying, [...] "I feel <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> everything possible {{should be done to}} ensure that future tragedies are prevented and therefore call on Transport Secretary Douglas Alexander to implement the recommendations from the AAIB report." [...] Blyth added, [...] "Had a second pilot been on the aircraft, or had the aircraft been equipped with a radio altimeter or other low-height warning device, the accident may not have happened." [...] Blyth also called for personal locator beacons for aircrew on such flights, which might have led to a quicker recovery of her fiancé's body. [...] "These are inexpensive but highly effective. Such equipment may not have saved Guy's life, but it almost certainly would have led to the recovery of his body in days rather than months," [...] said Blyth.|$|E
5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> about <b>that</b> song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the summer}} of 1969, a Chicago studio group {{produced}} a single record called [...] "Hey Hey! Holy Mackerel! (The Cubs Song)" [...] whose title and lyrics incorporated the catch-phrases of the respective TV and radio announcers for the Cubs, Jack Brickhouse and Vince Lloyd. Several members of the Cubs recorded an album called Cub Power which contained a cover of the song. The song received {{a good deal of}} local airplay that summer, associating it <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> with <b>that</b> bittersweet season. It was played much less frequently thereafter, although it remained an unofficial Cubs theme song for some years after.|$|R

It {{is not good for}} woman, any more than for man, to be alone, and when I am away on these long expeditions--taking the furs to the depot, searching out the Indians, hunting, etcetera,--she is left unavoidably alone. I have felt this <b>very</b> <b>strongly,</b> and <b>that</b> was why, as you know, I had made up my mind during the winter, and written to the governor and council that, as my time had expired, I meant to retire this spring." ...|$|R
