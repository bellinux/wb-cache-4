40|$|SUMMARY: Evidence {{is given}} that potato paracrinkle <b>virus,</b> potato <b>virus</b> <b>S</b> and {{carnation}} latent virus are serologically related {{and should be}} considered as related virus strains, although they differ considerably in their host range and pathogenicity, and only carnation latent virus is transmissible by aphids. It is suggested that the three have evolved from a common aphid-transmitted ancestor. In addition to the antigens which the three have in common, each has many specific ones, and the two strains from potato are more closely related to one another than to the carnation virus. No plant of the potato variety King Edward was found free from paracrinkle virus, and no Arran Victory plant free from <b>virus</b> <b>S.</b> Minor variants of both para-crinkle virus and of <b>virus</b> <b>S</b> were detected; it is suggested that the variations in severity of symptoms developed when Arran Victory plants are grafted with King Edward scions reflect the various degrees to which different isolates interfere with each other’s multiplication.

To see whether this effect promotes infection, we deleted the Shope fibroma <b>virus</b> <b>S</b> 131 R gene and compared the clinical manifestations of wild-type and mutant virus infections in rabbits. <b>S</b> 131 RΔ <b>virus</b> produced significantly smaller fibroxanthosarcoma-like growths in vivo and, {{at a point where}} these growths were already receding, wild-type infections still showed extensive leukocyte infiltration, necrosis, and fibromatous cell proliferation.

Hypothesis B: Later testing of <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> in new groups would show generalization of increased verbal output. Hypothesis C: Later testing of <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> in new groups would show the reinforced <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> being rated as performing {{a greater degree of}} leadership function than non-reinforced <b>Target</b> <b>Ss.</b> Hypothesis D: The degree of generalization of verbal output would be a function of time, with <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> retested one day later showing more generalization than <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> retested one week later.

Twenty-four groups of three Ss were tested in a soundproofed room, with a hooded panel containing a red and green light situated {{on the table in front}} of each S.

On Days 2 & 3, Ss under the Reinforced treatment were instructed that they would receive a green light when they facilitated the group discussion and a red light when they hindered the group process. Actually <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> were positively reinforced (green light) for talking and punished (red light) for silence, while Non- <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> were punished for talking. Ss under the Non-Reinforced treatment received neither positive reinforcement or punishment.

S. and Japanese economies experienced both superior and poor performances. In addition to analyzing the bidder - target relationship in general, focus on Japanese bidders permits us to investigate the role of unique Japanese characteristics: keiretsu membership, cross-holding and ties to a main bank. The unresolved debate on {{the efficiency of the}} U. S. versus Japanese corporate governance system developed in the early 1990 s, following the slowdown in the U. S. and boom in the Japanese economy. Critics claim that the main banks do nothing special and that the whole discussion is theory driven. In addition, the hypothesized advantages of the Japanese governance system, namely cross-holding, negligible shareholding, latitude and long-term focus of managers, may lead to greater agency problems. For data availability reason we analyzed U. <b>S.</b> <b>targets</b> whose stock continued to independently trade {{for at least a year}} following the acquisition. To separate general and uniquely Japanese effects of bidders, a sample of U. <b>S.</b> <b>targets,</b> that independently existed following acquisition by U.

To investigate the potential interactions between these two pathogens and the resulting response of various potato genotypes, ‘Defender’ and ‘Ranger Russet’ were inoculated with both P. infestans and PVS. The amount of sporulation {{and the extent of}} lesion expansion on inoculated leaves were measured to estimate the incidence of late blight. ‘Defender’ showed restricted spot lesions and had twenty times less amount of sporangia compared to ‘Ranger Russet’ when inoculated with P. infestans only. However, lesion expansion and sporulation increased significantly when ‘Defender’ was infected with PVS followed by inoculation with P. infestans. The increased late blight in PVS-infected ‘Defender’ suggests potential interaction between PVS and ‘Defender’ impacting the outcome to late blight infection.
