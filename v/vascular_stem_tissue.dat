40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Hypersensitive response-like (HR-like) needle {{reactions}} to infection {{by the white}} pine blister rust pathogen, Cronartium ribicola, have been reported for several species of five needle pines native to western North America. The best-studied examples are in Pinus monticola and P. lambertiana. In these species a "needle spot" phenotype has been identified in which HR-like needle reactions are related to disease resistance that is conditioned by a major gene. Conventionally it is believed that the HR-like needle reactions in resistant pines prevent spread of the pathogen to <b>vascular</b> <b>stem</b> <b>tissue</b> by HR mechanisms commonly seen in other plant-pathogen incompatibility interactions, i. e. a rapidly induced plant cell death and subsequent localized tissue necrosis.

Structural analyses of early C. ribicola needle colonization in resistant Pinus spp. have shown, however, that these symptoms and their underlying physiology are fundamentally different from the clearly defined HR described in other host-pathogen systems. Contrary to the pattern of HR responses seen in most incompatible host reactions, onset of needle lesions was first seen several weeks after initial entry of C. ribicola. We observed extensive proliferation of fungal hyphae in the host and penetration of the needle endodermis and vascular tissue by the pathogen prior to the onset of a discernable HR or cell necrosis. The amount of fungal tissue present and progress of needle colonization was similar for both resistant and susceptible Pinus spp. Therefore, typical HR does not appear to function in needles as the mechanism of disease resistance in the "needle reaction" phenotype...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the role of Phomopsis vaccinii in upright dieback disease of cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon). Specifically, the goals were to complete Koch 2 ̆ 7 s Postulates for P. vaccinii as a pathogen of cranberry, determine infection courts, evaluate the pathogenicity of various isolates of P. vaccinii and isolates of non-P. vaccinii Phomopsis from cranberry and blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), and determine which cranberry tissues P. vaccinii infects and colonizes. ^ Koch 2 ̆ 7 s Postulates were completed using tissue-cultured and rooted cuttings of two cultivars. It was therefore concluded that P. vaccinii is a causal agent of upright dieback disease. ^ Various infection courts were tested by conducting inoculations of different tissue using different wounding techniques. It was determined that, while non-wounded plants occasionally developed symptoms, stem-pierce wounds resulted in infection of more plants and typically greater tissue death than other wound techniques. A higher percent of plants on which current-year growth was inoculated developed symptoms compared to plants on which 1 -yr-old growth was inoculated. It was concluded that current-year growth in spring was the most susceptible growth stage, although plants can be infected throughout the season if wounded. It was observed that only current-year growth was affected when infection occurred in the current-year growth, and infection did not progress to adjacent runners or uprights if the infection occurred in the 1 -yr-old growth. ^ It was determined that isolates of P. vaccinii and non- P. vaccinii isolates of Phomopsis could result in symptom development on tissue-cultured cranberry plants and rooted cuttings of cranberry. More P. vaccinii isolates resulted in disease development than other Phomopsis sp. isolates. A few isolates did not result in symptom development on any inoculated plant, or resulted in symptom development on only a low percent of plants. Since these isolates were regularly isolated from symptomless tissue, it is probable that these isolates are non-parasitic endophytes of cranberry plants. ^ P. vaccinii-inoculated tissue-cultured plants were examined microscopically, and P. vaccinii was observed throughout necrotic leaf tissue and in <b>vascular</b> <b>stem</b> <b>tissue.</b> These observations indicate that P. vaccinii is a vascular pathogen. It is expected that the fungus infects succulent growth and progresses from leaf tissue into the stem tissue, or infects through stem wounds, eventually colonizing vascular tissue. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{hydroxyl}} {{group in the}} 3 -position of the phenylpropanoid compounds is introduced {{at the level of}} coumarate shikimate/ quinate esters, whose synthesis implicates an acyltransferase activity. Specific antibodies raised against the recombinant tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) acyltransferase revealed the accumulation of the enzyme in <b>stem</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> of tobacco, in accordance with a putative role in lignification. For functional analysis, the acyltransferase gene was silenced in Arabidopsis thaliana and N. benthamiana by RNA-mediated posttranscriptional gene silencing. In Arabidopsis, gene silencing resulted in a dwarf phenotype and changes in lignin composition as indicated by histochemical staining. An in-depth study of silenced N. benthamiana plants by immunological, histochemical, and chemical methods revealed the impact of acyltransferase silencing on soluble phenylpropanoids and lignin content and composition. In particular, a decrease in syringyl units and an increase in p-hydroxyphenyl units were recorded. Enzyme immunolocalization by confocal microscopy showed a correlation between enzyme accumulation levels and lignin composition in vascular cells. These results demonstrate the function of the acyltransferase in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis...|$|R

40|$|Vigor {{state of}} middle-aged pine stands was {{estimated}} during 2002 - 2008 at {{permanent sample plots}} by two methods: 1) visual estimation of stand vigor rank according to the 6 -point scale of Forest Regulations of RF and 2) method of induction of tree defense response (injection of stem with high molecular extractives from Ceratocystis laricicola mycelium and registration of parameters of stem phloem necrosis). The stands of similar origin and structure were preliminarily divided into background and polluted ones {{on the basis of}} different amount of polluting substances in snow cover. Estimation of external tree signs according to 6 -point scale didn't reveal significant differences between stands in monitored period. In contrast to this morphological method parameters of specific necrotic response of stem inner bark to fungal extract differed significantly in background and polluted stands. Parameters of the necrotic spots on the phloem were shown to depend on effect of creeping fire. The necrosis size increased and the necrosis "moved" toward crown during two years after the fire. The results are in accordance with the hypothesis that the size of phloem necrosis induced by the effect of extractives from phytopathogenic fungus mycelium on <b>stem</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> was determined by the tree state - it increased in damaged tree and decreased with tree state improvement.

40|$|Population {{dynamics}} of A. ritzemabosi and D. dipsaci were studied in two alfalfa fields in Wyoming. Symptomatic stem-bud tissue and root-zone soil from alfalfa plants exhibiting symptoms of D. dipsaci infection were collected at intervals of 3 to 4 weeks. Both nematodes were extracted from <b>stem</b> <b>tissue</b> with the Baermann funnel method and from soil with the sieving and Baermann funnel method. Soil moisture and soil temperature at 5 cm accounted for 64. 8 % and 61. 0 %, respectively, {{of the variability}} in numbers of both nematodes in soil at the Big Horn field. Also at the Big Horn field, A. ritzemabosi was found in soil on {{only three of the}} 14 collection dates, whereas D. dipsaci was found in soil on 12 dates. Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi was found in <b>stem</b> <b>tissue</b> samples on 9 of the 14 sampling dates whereas D. dipsaci was found on all dates. Populations of both nematodes in <b>stem</b> <b>tissue</b> peaked in October, and soil populations of both peaked in January, when soil moisture was greatest. Numbers of D. dipsaci in <b>stem</b> <b>tissue</b> were related to mean air temperature 3 weeks prior to tissue collection, while none of the climatic factors measured were associated with numbers of A. ritzemabosi. At the Dayton field, soil moisture plus soil temperature at 5 cm accounted for 98. 2 % and 91. 4 % of the variability in the soil populations of A. ritzemabosi and D. dipsaci, respectively. Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi was extracted from soil at two of the five collection dates, compared to extraction of D. dipsaci at three dates. Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi was collected from <b>stem</b> <b>tissue</b> at six of the seven sampling dates while D. dipsaci was found at all sampling dates.

40|$|Background and Aims The plant Hirtella physophora, the ant Allomerus decemarticulatus and a fungus, Trimmatostroma sp., form a {{tripartite}} association. The ants manipulate {{both the}} plant trichomes and the fungus to build galleries under the stems of their host plant used to capture prey. In {{addition to its}} structural role, the fungus also improves nutrient uptake by the host plant. But it still remains unclear whether the fungus plays an indirect or a direct role in transferring nutrients to the plant. This study aimed to trace the transfer of N from the fungus to the plant's <b>stem</b> <b>tissue.</b> Methods Optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the presence of fungal hyphae in the <b>stem</b> <b>tissues.</b> Then, a N- 15 -labelling experiment was combined with a nanoscale secondary-ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS 50) isotopic imaging approach to trace the movement of added N- 15 from the fungus to plant tissues. Key Results The TEM images clearly showed hyphae inside the <b>stem</b> <b>tissue</b> in the cellular compartment. Also, fungal hyphae were seen perforating {{the wall of the}} parenchyma cell. The N- 15 provisioning of the fungus in the galleries resulted in significant enrichment of the N- 15 signature of the plant's leaves 1 d after the N- 15 -labelling solution was deposited on the fungus-bearing trap. Finally, NanoSIMS imaging proved that nitrogen was transferred biotrophically from the fungus to the <b>stem</b> <b>tissue.</b> Conclusions This study provides evidence that the fungi are connected endophytically to an ant-plant system and actively transfer nitrogen from N- 15 -labelling solution to the plant's <b>stem</b> <b>tissues.</b> Overall, this study underlines how complex the trophic structure of ant-plant interactions is due to the presence of the fungus and provides insight into the possibly important nutritional aspects and tradeoffs involved in myrmecophyte-ant mutualisms...|$|R

Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry aromatic profiling (lignomics) identified 81 phenolic compounds, of which 65 were identified, to our knowledge, {{for the first time}} in flax and 11 {{for the first time in}} higher plants. Both aglycone forms and glycosides of monolignols, lignin oligomers, and (neo) lignans were identified in both inner and outer <b>stem</b> <b>tissues,</b> with a preponderance of glycosides in the hypolignified outer stem, indicating the existence of a complex monolignol metabolism.

Hypolignification of bast fibers in outer <b>stem</b> <b>tissues</b> was correlated with the low transcript abundance of monolignol biosynthetic genes, laccase genes, and certain peroxidase genes, suggesting that flax hypolignification is transcriptionally regulated.

40|$|Sorghum {{vegetative}} tissues {{are becoming}} increasingly important for biofuel production. The composition of sorghum <b>stem</b> <b>tissues</b> is influenced by genotype, environment and photoperiod sensitivity, and varies widely between varieties and also between different <b>stem</b> <b>tissues</b> (outer rind vs inner pith). Here, the amount of cellulose, (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-glucan, arabinose and xylose in the stems of twelve diverse sorghum varieties, including four photoperiod-sensitive varieties, was measured. At maturity, most photoperiod-insensitive lines had 1 % w/w (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-glucan in <b>stem</b> pith <b>tissue</b> whilst photoperiod-sensitive varieties remained in a vegetative stage and accumulated up to 6 % w/w (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-glucan in the same tissue. Three sorghum lines were chosen for further study: a cultivated grain variety (Sorghum bicolor BTx 623), a sweet variety (S. bicolor Rio) and a photoperiod-sensitive wild line (S. bicolor ssp. verticilliflorum Arun). The Arun line accumulated 5. 5 % w/w (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-glucan and had higher SbCslF 6 and SbCslH 3 transcript levels in pith tissues than did photoperiod-insensitive varieties Rio and BTx 623 (< 1 % w/w pith (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-glucan). To assess the digestibility of the three varieties, <b>stem</b> <b>tissue</b> was treated with either hydrolytic enzymes or dilute acid {{and the release of}} fermentable glucose was determined.

40|$|Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) and Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidifoliorum (Pfm) {{are closely}} related pathovars infecting kiwifruit, but Psa is {{considered}} one of the most important global pathogens, whereas Pfm is not. In this study of Actinidia deliciosa ‘Hayward’ responses to the two pathovars, the objective was to test whether differences in plant defense responses mounted against the two pathovars correlated with the contrasting severity of the symptoms caused by them. Results showed that Psa infections were always more severe than Pfm infections, and were associated with highly localized, differential expression of phytohormones and putative defense gene transcripts in <b>stem</b> <b>tissue</b> closest to the inoculation site. Phytohormone concentrations of jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonate isoleucine (JA-Ile), salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid were always greater in <b>stem</b> <b>tissue</b> than in leaves, and leaf phytohormones were not affected by pathogen inoculation. Pfm inoculation induced a threefold increase in SA in stems relative to Psa inoculation, and a smaller 1. 6 -fold induction of JA. Transcript expression showed no effect of inoculation in leaves, but Pfm inoculation resulted in the greatest elevation of the SA marker genes, PR 1 and glucan endo- 1, 3 -beta-glucosidase (β- 1, 3 -glucosidase) (32 - and 25 -fold increases, respectively) in <b>stem</b> <b>tissue</b> surrounding the inoculation site. Pfm inoculation also produced a stronger response than Psa inoculation in localized <b>stem</b> <b>tissue</b> for the SA marker gene PR 6, jasmonoyl-isoleucine- 12 -hydrolase (JIH 1), which acts as a negative marker of the JA pathway, and APETALA 2 /Ethylene response factor 2 transcription factor (AP 2 ERF 2), which is involved in JA/SA crosstalk. WRKY 40 transcription factor (a SA marker) was induced equally in stems by wounding (mock inoculation) and pathovar inoculation. Taken together, these results suggest that the host appears to mount a stronger, localized, SA-based defense response to Pfm than Psa...|$|R
