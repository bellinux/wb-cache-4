40|$|In Germany and Europe {{veterinary}} {{medicinal products}} are subject to strict regulatory requirements. As part of the authorisation procedure, active substances are investigated in regard to their effects on humans, animals and the environment. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) for humans of each active substance is derived {{on the basis of}} scientific studies. The ADI serves to determine maximum residue levels (MRL) for foodstuff of animal origin (meat, kidney, fat, milk, eggs and honey). The MRL are determined so that the daily intake of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> residues up to these levels is not expected to endanger the health of the consumer. In light of the discovery that plants are able to take up <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> residues from soil, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) carried out an expert panel in December 2009. The aim of the panel was to reveal the current state of scientific knowledge on the potential carry-over of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> residues in foods of plant origin and its effects. It was determined that results from model experiments and modelling have provided initial indications for the behaviour of some active substances and their metabolites (transformation products) in slurry, in soil and in the plant. Yet current data do not allow a reliable estimate for the extent of intake of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> residues through foods of plant origin. Overall experts agree, however, that based on the present data on antibiotics residues (e. g. sulfonamides, tetracyclines and fluorochinoloni) in foods of plant origin no risk is expected for consumers from a toxicological perspective.

No studies have been conducted to describe and assess the adequacy of the current routes and methods of supply of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> to these farmers. A combination of focus groups, self-administered questionnaires and direct observations was used to collect information for the purpose of describing and understanding the situation regarding the supply of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> to the farmers of the Madikwe district. A combination of semi-structured interviews, questionnaires and direct observation was used to gather information. The results indicated that the routes and methods of supply of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> to the farmers of the Madikwe district were inadequate. The annual sales from outlets within the Madikwe district were poor, with a total of 396 units sold over a period of one year, although there were approximately 2000 farmers in the Madikwe district who were potential clients for these outlets. The majority of products sold by these outlets were ectoparasiticides, followed by Tetracycline antibiotics. The outlets within the Madikwe district were unable to supply vaccines, as they did not have adequate facilities for the storage of these thermolabile products. Farmers had to travel an average of 70 km if they wished to purchase <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> from farmers' co-operatives and pharmacies in larger towns outside the Madikwe district. The routes and methods of supply did not ensure correct storage, and safe and effective use of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Several examples of misuse and incorrect storage and handling of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> were discovered. Inadequate information transfer, inaccessibility of outlets, poor reliability and quality of outlets and poor service were discovered as reasons for the inadequacy of the routes and methods of supply.

40|$|Two {{medicinal}} products containing the same active substances are considered bioequivalent {{if they are}} pharmaceutically equivalent, {{they have the same}} bioavailability and comparable plasmatic curve. Sometimes bioequivalence can be investigated with in vitro-studies, like dissolution test. The BCS (Biopharmaceutics Classification System) -based biowaiver approach is useful to reduce in vivo bioequivalence studies, it may represent a “surrogate” for in vivo bioequivalence. This concept is applicable to immediate release and solid pharmaceutical products for oral administration and systemic action having the same pharmaceutical form. BCS-based biowaivers are applicable to substances with “high solubility” and “high permeability” (BCS-class I) like Enrofloxacin and Metronidazole, or “high solubility” and “low permeability” (BCS-class III) like Spiramycin. The objective of this research work was to develop two new products "comparable" and "alternative" respect to the products already on the market. In the first project, conventional release tablets of "Spiramycin" and “Metronidazole” were developed in two different doses, equivalent to a <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> on the market. In the second project, conventional release tablets of "Enrofloxacin" were developed in two different doses, equivalent to a <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> on the market. Bioequivalence studies were conducted using BCS-based biowaivers approach. Both projects are divided into different steps: formulation development, development and validation of analytical method, and bioequivalence in vitro-study. Bioequivalence between “new” and “originator” product has been demonstrated using the dissolution tests and comparing the dissolution curves. Active ingredients are rapidly and equally released by the two formulations at all pH values. The analysis of variance carried out by applying the two-way ANOVA test shows that the effect of the composition of the product is not significant, while the effect of the time is highly significant. “Developed” and “originator” products are pharmaceutically equivalent and bioequivalent, so they can be considered therapeutically equivalent...|$|E
40|$|By {{degrading}} the dung {{of livestock}} that graze on pastures, coprophilous arthropods accelerate the cycling of nutrients to maintain pasture quality. Many veterinary medicinal products, such as ivermectin, are excreted unchanged in the dung of treated livestock. These residues can be insecticidal and {{may reduce the}} function (i. e., dung-degradation) of the coprophilous community. In the present study, we used a standard method to monitor the degradation of dung from cattle treated with ivermectin. The present study was performed during a 1 -yr period on pastures in Canada, France, The Netherlands, and Switzerland. Large effects of residue were detected on the coprophilous community, but degradation of dung was not significantly hampered. The results emphasize that failure to detect an effect of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> residues on dung-degradation {{does not mean that}} the residues do not affect the coprophilous community. Rather, insect activity is only one of many factors that affect degradation, and these other factors may mask the nontarget effect of residues. </p...|$|E

To verify the efficacy of the treatment and the effect on eggs, larvae, adult bees and queens, clinical trials were performed in several apiaries spread throughout Italy, under different climatic and regional conditions. The average acaricide efficacy rate was more than 95 %, with a maximum level of 99 %. With regard to safety, no adverse reactions were observed on larvae, adult bees and queens when compared to untreated colonies. One adverse reaction was noted, however, a high mortality of eggs. The eggs were quickly replaced by the queen in a few days, without affecting the wellbeing of the colony. The results showed that the acaricide is efficacious and safe for colonies. The medicine can be used with brood, throughout the season of the bee activity. Moreover, the product is ready-to-use, safe for users and suitable for organic farming...|$|E

40|$|Summary: The main {{consequences}} for the <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> sector of the recent wave of liberalisation in Africa’s livestock sector have been a proliferation of operators, a diversification of product origin and a general decline in product quality. In this context, all the stakeholders involved agree that legislation on veterinary medicinal products needs to be harmonised among the African countries. Despite this consensus, however, the situation has not changed much in the countries themselves. In order to explore operational guidelines for harmonising national legislation in Africa, with particular reference to the registration and quality control of veterinary medicinal products, the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) drew up a status report on the member countries of the OIE Regional Commission for Africa based on the answers to a questionnaire. The report revealed that, even though {{a number of countries}} had developed legislative texts on medicinal products, these texts vary widely from one country to another and in only a few cases are they specific to veterinary medicinal products. In most cases, the implementing regulations are not properly enforced.

40|$|International audienceOxfendazole, methyl- 5 (6) -phenylsulfinyl- 2 -{{benzimidazole}} carbamate, is {{a member}} of the benzimidazole family of anthelmintics. Anthelmintic benzimidazoles are widely used in meat producing animals (cattle, sheep and pigs) for control of endoparasites. The extensive use of veterinary drugs in food-producing animals can cause the presence of small quantities of the drug residues in food. Maximum residue limit or "MRL" means the maximum concentration of residue resulting from the use of a <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> which may be legally permitted recognized as acceptable in food. The FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (1999) evaluations of toxicological and residue data, reported that oxfendazole (MRL) has toxicological hazards on human health. The toxicity of oxfendazole (MRL) was tested in male and female mice and their fetuses. Chromosomal aberrations, teratological examination and biochemical analysis were the parameters used in this study. The results show that oxfendazole MRL induced a mutagenic effect in all tested cell types. Also, oxfendazole exhibit embryotoxicity including teratogenicity. The biochemical results show that oxfendazole induced a disturbance in the different biochemical contents of all tested tissues. So, we must increase the attention paid to the potential risk of oxfendazole residues in human beings and should stress the need for careful control to ensure adherence to the prescribed withdrawal time of this drug...|$|E
30|$|There is {{increasing}} research activity regarding {{the transformation of}} single substances under laboratory conditions. Current guidance, e.g., the “guideline on determining the fate of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in manure” [19], takes transformation of VMPs and biocides in manure into account. However, there is no standardized experimental test protocol available to examine the transformation of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (VMPs) and biocides in liquid manure. The EMA guideline on transformation in manure [19] only contains basic regulatory requirements. To allow for a consistent assessment of studies within regulatory frameworks, a harmonized internationally accepted and validated test method is needed.

40|$|A {{ranking system}} for <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and {{medicated}} feed additives {{has been developed}} {{as a tool to}} be applied in a risk-based approach to the residue testing programme for foods of animal origin in the National Residue Control Plan. In the context of food sampling and residue testing for the National Residue Control Plan, there is firstly, the risk to human health from residues of chemical substances in food and secondly, the issue of non-compliance with regulations relating to residues in food due to improper farm practices; both these elements are included in the developed risk-ranking of substances. Three characteristics of substances that may occur as residues in food are included in the developed risk-ranking system: ‘Potency’, as measured by the acceptable daily intake value assigned to each substance; ‘Usage’, as measured by the three factors of number of doses, use on individual animals or for group treatment, and withdrawal period; ‘Residue Occurrence’, as measured by non-compliant samples in the National Residue Control Plan. The risk-ranking system for substances has been developed using a scoring system applied to the various parameters to give an overall score. It is a relatively simple system, designed to provide a basis for selecting the <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and medicated feed additives that might be prioritised for residue testing. However, a number of limitations are associated with the system and this risk-ranking of substances represents only one component of a total risk-based approach to designing the residue testing programme. Other factors which should be taken into account include issues such as evidence of misuse of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and medicated feed additives and changes to maximum residue limits in the specifications for particular <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and medicated feed additives.

Cecum samples were taken 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dosing on days 3 and 7 of the treatment. These samples were analysed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC/MS/MS). The results show that 105 IU/kg did not expose the cecum to inhibitory concentrations and 210 IU/kg failed to maintain bactericidal levels {{for more than a}} few hours. The 420 IU/mg dose maintained bactericidal concentrations for the entire 24 -hour period with 2102 µg/kg as the lowest mean concentration measured over the considered period, a value close to the target Minimal Bactericidal Concentration of 1860 µg/ml estimated for bacitracin in vitro. Concentrations obtained at 840 IU/kg were far higher. These results justify a daily dose of 420 IU/kg/day in the treatment of intestinal infections where Clostridium perfringens can be isolated. In addition, after 30 days of continuous administration at 420 IU/kg body weight, blood concentrations remained below the detection limit (< 37. 5 µg/l).

40|$|The EC {{has issued}} {{directives}} (1981, 1992) requesting for registration of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> information to enable {{an assessment of}} the product's safety for the environment. As a whole, the risk assessment is structured around the hazard quotient approach used in USES (1994). Predicted environmental concentrations are compared with effect values established in toxicity studies. In the a risk assessment methodology presented in directive 81 / 852 /EEC the assessment process is described in two phases. The first phase (I) shall assess the potential of exposure of the environment to the product, its ingredients, or relevant metabolites. The first phase is thus limited to product identification and exposure assessment. Several exemptions for further testing are given, such as trigger values for predicted environmental concentrations (PECs). When these exemptions fail to apply and trigger values are exceeded, Phase II is entered. Phase II is also divided in two parts, Tier A and Tier B. Tier A begins with an elaborate evaluation of the possible fate and effects.

40|$|The {{spread of}} {{veterinary}} medicinal products (VMP) and biocides onto agriculturally used areas represents a very important path of entry into the environment for these product groups. For this reason, current guidance (e. g. "Guideline on determining the fate of {{veterinary medicinal products}} in manure" (EMA/CVMP/ERA/ 430327 / 2009) (EMA, 2011) stipulates experimental studies on transformation of VMPs and biocides in manure. Though, the documents only contain basic regulatory requirements, whereas an experimental test guideline is still missing, both on EU and OECD level. To allow for a consistent assessment of studies within the registration process, a harmonized internationally accepted and validated test method is needed.

The most received classes of antimicrobial VMP’s in dogs and cats in the Netherlands are the combination of penicillins, inclusive beta-lactamase inhibitors (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) : 38, 29 %, 36, 32 %, 38, 24 %, respectively 2009 (n= 59), 2010 (n= 65), 2011 (n= 67), followed by the penicillins with extended spectrum (amoxicillin, ampicillin) : 13, 19 %, 13, 01 %, 11, 73 %, respectively 2009 (n= 59), 2010 (n= 65), 2011 (n= 67). The third and fourth most received classes of antimicrobial VMP’s in dogs and cats in the Netherlands are the cephalosporins 3 rd generation (cefovecin) : 11, 95 %, 11, 14 %, 10, 23 %, respectively 2009 (n= 59), 2010 (n= 65), 2011 (n= 67) and cephalosporins 1 st generation (cefalexin, cefadroxil) : 10, 63 %, 11, 43 %, 11, 25 %, respectively 2009 (n= 59), 2010 (n= 65), 2011 (n= 67). Monitoring of the antimicrobial VMP use is important and general surveillance programs for companion animals should be used to monitor the extent and pattern of antimicrobial VMP usage and trends of antimicrobial resistance in companion animals in near future...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The most {{frequently}} used method to administer medicinal products in the intensified poultry and pig industry is by application in feed or drinking water. Besides medicinal products, also technological-, sensory-, nutritional- and zootechnical additives {{can be added to}} the feed. Some of these feed additives contain high amounts of clays and are primarily intended to be used as mycotoxin binders. Mycotoxin binders (short: binders) are deemed to adsorb mycotoxins in the gut of the animal thereby preventing the oral absorption of toxic compounds. Most binders contain montmorillonite clays which have previously been reported to decrease the clinical efficacy of tilmicosin 1 and the oral absorption of tylosin 2, both in broiler chickens. Therefore, the aim of this project was to investigate the effect of binders on the oral bioavailability of frequently used veterinary drugs in mass medication, in vitro and in vivo, in broiler chickens. Material and Methods: First, the in vitro adsorption of sulfadiazine (SDZ), trimethoprim (TRIM), tylosin (TYL), doxycycline (DOX) 3, diclazuril (DICL), lasalocid (LAS) and salinomycin (SAL) to 6 different mycotoxin binders and active carbon (AC, used as positive control) was assessed in a single-concentration adsorption screening assay. The binders or AC were incubated for 4 hours in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at three different pH’s and 37 °C for 4 h with each one of the <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> mentioned above. Next, two in vivo pharmacokinetic experiments were executed in broiler chickens with 2 selected clay-based binders or active carbon. Pharmacokinetic profiles were determined for SD +TRIM and DOX 3 in broilers that received a single oral bolus containing a daily dose of either drug solely, or the combination of binder and drug. Results: Several binder-drug combinations showed over 90 % in vitro adsorption for TRIM, DOX, DICL, LAS or SAL. Results of the 2 in vivo experiments demonstrated a significant interaction of 2 clay-based binders and DOX 3, since these binders were able to lower the oral bioavailability of DOX to less than 40 % compared to broilers receiving only DOX. No interactions of these binders with SDZ+TRIM combinations were seen...|$|E

40|$|OIE’s {{activities}} {{related to}} <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> are based on several complementary approaches such as: • The development and regular updating of international standards and guidelines within {{the mandate of the}} OIE as the standard-setting body for animal health and zoonotic diseases recognised by the World Trade Organization; • The permanent support to Veterinary Services and laboratories to enable OIE Members to implement the published standards; • The development of a coherent communication and training programme; and • The modernisation or update of national legislation for marketing approval and control of veterinary products. This approach is clearly supported by donors at the global, regional and national levels. To enforce communication and enhance awareness of the need for harmonisation and improvement of registration, distribution and quality control of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> OIE is currently organising specific conferences and training workshops. The OIE has recently reinforced its network of National Focal Points to allow experts designated b...|$|R
