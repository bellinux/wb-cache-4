The school building's name [...] "Landour" [...] was lost with the closure of the school, as this is not commemorated in any way in the modern development off Northfields Drive, which takes its name from Northfield. The school playing fields were lost to developers prior to the final closure of the school and a number of houses were built on the pitches and are accessed via a road built on the route of the original <b>vehicle</b> <b>gateway</b> from Boathouse Drive.

40|$|Modern {{vehicles}} use {{a variety}} of data networks to exchange data between their different control modules. These networks operate at different communication speeds to reflect the relative response times of the connected control units. For example, engine control units are connected to a high-speed network while comfort systems such as electric seats are connected to a low speed network. In addition, {{there are a number of}} different network operating principles, for example, event-driven and timetriggered. Gateways are required to exchange data between these different <b>vehicle</b> networks. <b>Gateways</b> typically exchange messages between connected networks based solely on the destination and priority of the messages. Such gateways can result in unpredictable message delays depending on the network loading and vehicle operating conditions. The aim of this research is to develop and evaluate a <b>vehicle</b> network <b>gateway</b> model based on a very general and well designed gateway structure from the automotive industry, which takes into account factors such as the purpose of network messages, vehicle operating conditions, network loading, bus topology and message streams. The network gateway model is used to evaluate the relative performance of different gateway configurations...|$|R

The system prototype was developed and tested using an electric vehicle (EV) and the respective sensor systems. The main components of the proposed IoT system are: a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) intra-vehicular wireless sensor network (IVWSN); a mobile device that acts both as the <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>gateway,</b> connecting the IVWSN to the Internet, and as the vehicle’s human machine interface (HMI); an online server/database, based on Firebase; a client, which can be either a mobile device or a personal computer; and a residential wireless sensor network (WSN). The use of a wireless network to collect sensor data inside of the vehicle introduces some advantages when compared with conventional wired networks, whereas {{the inclusion of a}} residential WSNs in the proposed IoT architecture allows the provision of additional features, such as automatic control of the EV battery charging process.

30|$|In this paper, an {{integration}} of 5 G-cloud-VMesh network is introduced. The envisioned architecture shall enable data access from the vehicles, anytime and anywhere. In particular, the {{integration of}} IEEE 802.11 -based multi-hop VANETs with 5 G shall contribute {{to the evolution of}} beyond 4 G wireless communication systems. The proposed 5 CVN-adroit algorithm addresses the choosing of an optimal gateway and Aggregator Node B (ANB) in the network layer from and to the service requesters and the cloud using 5 G technologies. 5 CVN-adroit algorithm consists of two key processes such as metric-based gateway selection and metric-based ANB selection. In the majority of the existing research, gateways are considered static and deployed on the road at fixed distances from each other, depending on their wireless transmission range, which makes the deployment costlier. Moreover, the multi-hop and dynamic nature of VANET communication impacts the stability of the links to these gateways. Furthermore, as these gateways are fixed, the discovery and routing processes are mainly pro-active. Although the pro-active routing mechanisms reduce delay, they increase the frequent changes in the predefined routing tables of vehicles and routing overhead. To deal with these limitations, this paper defines the concept of <b>vehicle</b> <b>gateways.</b> Any <b>vehicle</b> in the VMesh network can act as a gateway. A gateway refers to the dual-interfaced vehicle that relays the packet from sources to the 5 G backhaul network. It is enabled with dual interfaces of IEEE 802.11 p and the 5 G backhaul networks. The major challenge is to amalgamate these two network interfaces on a gateway, as they lie in two different spectrum regions. The next challenge is to choose a minimum number of optimal gateways using relevant metrics. There could be several nodes in the VMesh network, which possess the important criterion and required metric information, and hence, the qualification to serve as gateways. The focus of this paper is on defining a mechanism that chooses a minimum number of optimal gateways, at an instance, so as to avoid the bottleneck at the 5 G backhaul network. With this regard, as pro-active gateway discovery reduces delay and reactive discovery reduces routing overhead, this paper envisages a hybrid gateway discovery mechanism for VMesh network, combining the pros of both pro-active and reactive concepts.|$|R
30|$|<b>Gateway</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{selection}} and management is the prominent {{issue in the}} mechanism of multi-hop relay based on the Integrated VANET-cellular networks Heterogeneous Wireless Network. This {{is due to the}} non-similarity characteristics in vehicles, which lead to inability of the gateway to access. To solve this problem, one of the proposed solutions is to assemble them in groups (clusters) based on vehicles with similar characteristics and elect a cluster head (CH) for each group (cluster), which becomes the <b>gateway</b> node. <b>Vehicle</b> clustering is promising to resolve this issue, where cluster-head selection depends only on the geographical location of vehicles. In consequence, the cluster head of the cluster does not have the basic standards to manage the VANET groups, so that it enables them to connect with the cellular network.|$|R

From these clusters, a minimum number of vehicles, equipped with IEEE 802. 11 p and UTRAN interfaces, are selected as vehicular gateways to link VANET to Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems (UMTS).

ITS {{is a system that}} applies the following technologies to the whole transportation management system efficiently, including information technique, wireless communication, sensor networks, control technique, and computer engineering. ITS provides an accurate, real time and synthetically efficient transportation management system. Obviously, Vehicular Ad Hoc NETworks (VANETs) attract growing attention from both the research community and industry all over the world. This is because a large amount of applications are enabled by VANETs, such as safety related applications, traffic management, commercial applications and general applications. When connecting to the internet or communicating with different networks in order to access a variety of services using VANETs, drivers and passengers in different cars {{need to be able to}} exchange messages with <b>gateways</b> from their <b>vehicles.</b> A secure <b>gateway</b> discovery process is therefore critical, because vehicles should not be subject to security attacks while they are communicating; however, currently there is no existing protocol focusing on secure gateway discovery.

40|$|The OEXP {{vehicles}} being envisioned {{to carry}} out the Presidential space goals of a lunar outpost and human exploration of Mars will require on-orbit assembly, refurbishment, checkout, and launch. The On-orbit Assembly/Servicing Task Definition Study applies the space vehicle processing experience and procedures archives resident at NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to determine the task flows, and resources/facilities necessary to process the OEXP vehicles at Space Station Freedom (SSF). This data base is examined to find the closest analogies to OEXP vehicle components and assembly/refurbishment tasks. Transition tables are generated to provide traceability from KSC hardware processing experience to analogous on-orbit processing of the OEXP vehicles. Iterations in which the task flows are broken down into realistic extravehicular activity (EVA) primitive subtasks and times, and to apply automation and robotic technology to reduce crew risks and minimize EVA time, will enhance the value and accuracy of the predicted flows. These processing scenarios and the resulting resource/facility requirements are used to determine impacts of SSF, resulting in change requests to SSF requirements for provision of 'hooks and scars' to evolve the assembly complete Space Station into a transportation node. Study results to date include assembly analysis of the Martin Marietta Phobos <b>Gateway</b> <b>Vehicle,</b> refurbishment analysis of the Martin Marietta Lunar Evolution Piloted and Cargo Vehicles, and assembly analysis of the Boeing Mars Evolution Vehicle.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} several related {{pieces of}} work on underwater acoustic networks (UANs). Underwater wireless networks generally use acoustics, as radio is heavily attenuated and light is strongly scattered underwater. UANs are becoming more widely deployed for scientific, environmental, industrial, and military applications. The network nodes can be stationary sensor nodes, underwater vehicles, surface buoys or <b>vehicles</b> providing a <b>gateway</b> to radio networks, or bottom nodes providing a gateway to cabled undersea networks. Packet detection in interference in UANs, and its {{critical role in the}} effectiveness of collision-avoidance medium-access control (MAC) protocols, is a primary focus of this thesis. Spreading loss measures the decrease in received energy as a function of range, and determines the level of long-range interference. We present a new spreading model, the mixed-exponent spreading model, for UAN nodes using a matched-filter detector as a low-power wakeup detector. Under this model, there are distinct spreading-loss exponents for packet detection and interference, due to the matched-filter detector 2 ̆ 7 s signal processing. We validate this spreading model numerically, and with direct measurements of the spreading exponents from shallow-water experimental data. The widely used, but poorly grounded, 2 ̆ 2 practical spreading 2 ̆ 2 model is inconsistent with our experimental measurements. Our results suggest caution for its continued use to model performance of UANs. Building on our spreading analysis, we analyze the effectiveness of collision-avoidance MAC protocols in UANs, namely what fraction of collisions are avoided when using the protocol, independent of propagation delay. The low spreading loss in UANs, in particular with the mixed-exponent spreading model, can lead to low collision-avoidance effectiveness compared with radio networks. In addition, we argue that many UANs will be relatively mobile and sparse relative to terrestrial sensor networks, reducing the importance of network energy consumption and throughput of medium-access control protocols as metrics. This survey challenges some of the assumptions made in past UAN research, with a goal of aiding researchers entering the area of UANs from terrestrial sensor networks. Finally, we document the design decisions for a new underwater acoustic modem, as a contribution to researchers entering the field from terrestrial sensor networks. ...|$|R
