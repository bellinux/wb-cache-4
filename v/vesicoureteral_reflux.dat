25|$|The three openings, two {{ureteric}} orifices, and {{the internal}} urethral orifice mark the triangular area called the trigone of the bladder. These openings have mucosal flaps {{in front of them}} that act as valves in preventing the backflow of urine into the ureters, known as <b>vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux.</b> Between the two ureteric openings is a raised area of tissue called the interureteric crest. This makes the upper boundary of the trigone. The trigone is a smooth-muscle area that forms the floor of the bladder above the urethra. It is an area of smooth tissue for the easy flow of urine into and from this part of the bladder - in contrast to the irregular surface formed by the rugae.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{children}} with <b>vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux</b> are asymptomatic. [...] <b>Vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux</b> may be diagnosed {{as a result}} of further evaluation of dilation of the kidney or ureters draining urine from the kidney while in utero as well as when a sibling has VUR (though routine testing in either circumstance is controversial). [...] Reflux also increases risk of acute bladder and kidney infections, so testing for reflux may be performed after a child has one or more infections.|$|E
2500|$|Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is more {{specific}} for the diagnosis. Normal plicae circularis are variable in appearance and often not seen on normal VCUGs. [...] PUV on voiding cystourethrogram {{is characterized by}} an abrupt tapering of urethral caliber near the verumontanum, with the specific level depending on the developmental variant. <b>Vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux</b> is also seen in over 50% of cases.|$|E
2500|$|Ectrodactyly–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft syndrome, or EEC, {{and also}} {{referred}} to as EEC syndrome (also known as [...] "Split hand–split foot–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft syndrome") is a rare form of ectodermal dysplasia, an autosomal dominant disorder inherited as an genetic trait. EEC is characterized by the triad of ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and facial clefts. Other features noted in association with EEC include <b>vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux,</b> recurrent urinary tract infections, obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct, decreased pigmentation of the hair and skin, missing or abnormal teeth, enamel hypoplasia, absent punctae in the lower eyelids, photophobia, occasional cognitive impairment and kidney anomalies, and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux</b> (VUR), {{also known}} as vesicoureteric reflux, is a {{condition}} in which urine flows retrograde, or backward, from the bladder into the ureters/kidneys. [...] Urine normally travels in one direction (forward, or anterograde) from the kidneys to the bladder via the ureters, with a 1-way valve at the vesicoureteral (ureteral-bladder) junction preventing backflow. [...] The valve is formed by oblique tunneling of the distal ureter through the wall of the bladder, creating a short length of ureter (1–2cm) that can be compressed as the bladder fills. [...] Reflux occurs if the ureter enters the bladder without sufficient tunneling, i.e., too [...] "end-on".|$|E
2500|$|Additional {{congenital}} anomalies, {{effects on}} other organs, and less common features of JBS have included: imperforate anus (occlusion of the anus), <b>vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux</b> (reversal {{of the flow}} of urine, from the bladder back into the ureters, toward the kidneys); [...] of the uterus and vagina in female infants, neonatal cholestasis of the liver, with cirrhosis and portal hypertension (high blood pressure in the hepatic portal vein); dilated cardiomyopathy, dextrocardia (congenital displacement of the heart to {{the right side of the}} chest), atrial and ventricular septal defect; low birth-weight, failure to thrive, hypotonia (decreased muscle tone); sacral hiatus (a structural deficiency of the sacral vertebrae), congenital cataracts, and cafe-au-lait spots.|$|E
2500|$|The goal of {{treatment}} is to minimize infections, {{as it is}} infections that cause renal scarring and not the <b>vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux.</b> [...] Minimizing infections is primarily done by prophylactic antibiotics in newborns and infants who are not potty trained. [...] However, in children who are older, physicians and parents should focus on bowel and bladder management. [...] Children who hold their bladder or who are constipated have {{a greater number of}} infections than children who void on a regular schedule. [...] When medical management fails to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections, or if the kidneys show progressive renal scarring then surgical interventions may be necessary. Medical management is recommended in children with Grade I-III VUR as most cases will resolve spontaneously. A trial of medical treatment is indicated in patients with Grade IV VUR especially in younger patients or those with unilateral disease. Of the patients with Grade V VUR only infants are trialled on a medical approach before surgery is indicated, in older patients surgery is the only option.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux</b> {{refers to}} the reflux of fluid from the bladder to the ureters during urination.

50|$|Using a urinary catheter, radiocontrast is {{instilled in}} the bladder, and X-ray imaging is performed. Cystography {{can be used}} to {{evaluate}} bladder cancer, <b>vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux,</b> bladder polyps, and hydronephrosis. It requires less radiation than pelvic CT, although it is less sensitive and specific than MRI or CT. In adult cases, the patient is typically instructed to void three times, after which a post voiding image is obtained to see how much urine is left within the bladder (residual urine), which is useful to evaluate bladder contraction dysfunction. A final radiograph of the kidneys after the procedure is finished is performed to evaluate for occult <b>vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux</b> that was not seen during the procedure itself.|$|E

50|$|Deletions of C16orf95 {{have been}} {{associated}} with hydronephrosis, microcephaly, distichiasis, <b>vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux,</b> and intellectual impairment. However, the deletions included coding regions of the following genes: F-box Protein 31 (FBXO31), Microtubule-Associated Protein 1 Light Chain 3 Beta (MAP1LC3B), and Zinc Finger CCHC Type 14 (ZCCHC14). The contributions of each of these genes to the observed phenotypes has yet to be scientifically determined.|$|E
50|$|The {{junction}} {{between the}} {{pelvis of the kidney}} and the ureters {{is known as}} the ureteropelvic junction or ureteral pelvic junction, and the junction between the ureter and the bladder is known as the ureterovesical (ureter-bladder) junction. At the entrance to the bladder, the ureters are surrounded by valves known as ureterovesical valves, which prevent <b>vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux</b> (backflow of urine).|$|E
50|$|The {{bilateral}} {{condition is}} incompatible with survival, as the contralateral system frequently is abnormal as well. Contralateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction is found in 3% to 12% of infants with multicystic kidney and contralateral <b>vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux</b> is seen even more often, in 18% to 43% of infants.

Renal disease includes nephrotic syndrome, cystic kidney, renal dysplasia, hypoplasia or aplasia, pelvicalyceal deformity, <b>vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux,</b> chronic kidney disease, hematuria, proteinuria and renal scarring.|$|E
50|$|Reflux {{nephropathy}} is kidney damage (nephropathy) due to urine flowing backward (reflux) {{from the}} bladder toward the kidneys; {{the latter is}} called <b>vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux</b> (VUR). Longstanding VUR can result in small and scarred kidneys during {{the first five years}} of life in affected children. The end results of reflux nephropathy can include high blood pressure, excessive protein loss in the urine, and eventually kidney failure.|$|E
5000|$|A voiding cystogram is a {{functional}} study where contrast [...] "dye" [...] is injected through a catheter into the bladder. Under x-ray the radiologist asks {{the patient to}} void (usually young children) and will watch the contrast exiting the body on the x-ray monitor. This examines the child's bladder and lower urinary tract. Typically looking for <b>vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux,</b> involving urine backflow up into the kidneys.|$|E
50|$|Blockage {{of urine}} flow {{in an area}} below the kidneys results in postrenal azotemia. It {{can be caused by}} {{congenital}} abnormalities such as <b>vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux,</b> blockage of the ureters by kidney stones, pregnancy, compression of the ureters by cancer, prostatic hyperplasia, or blockage of the urethra by kidney or bladder stones. Like in prerenal azotemia, there is no inherent renal disease. The increased resistance to urine flow can cause back up into the kidneys, leading to hydronephrosis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{underlying}} {{contributors to}} UAB include neurologic disease, metabolic disease (e.g. diabetes), chronic bladder outlet obstruction (e.g. obstructive BPH or complications of anterior vaginal surgery), cognitive decline (such as with aging), psychiatric disorders, and {{adverse effects of}} medications. Additionally, structural abnormalities expanding the urinary reservoir beyond the bladder, such as massive <b>vesicoureteral</b> <b>reflux</b> or large bladder diverticulae, can result in UAB. While aging itself {{is often associated with}} UAB (and DU), there is scant evidence to support this claim.|$|E
