5|$|The 1470-class Pacific was {{the third}} Great Northern {{locomotive}} type to incorporate Gresley's universal 3-cylinder layout. All three cylinders drove the middle coupled axle. The outside cranks were set at 120°, with the inside crank displaced by about 7 degrees {{to allow for the}} 1:8 inclination of the inside cylinder. Gresley conjugated valve gear derived the motion of the inside <b>valve</b> <b>spindle</b> from the two outside valve spindles: this eliminated an inaccessible middle set of valve gear between the frames. A feature of the K4 that had soon been abandoned by the Pennsylvania Railroad was an unusual three-bar version of the Laird slide-bar. However, Gresley adopted this type of slide-bar for all his locomotives and it was later taken up by Bulleid for his Pacifics and by Riddles for the British Railways standard designs.|$|E
25|$|Next, {{the fact}} that in midgear the valve opening should be the same for the piston in both front and rear dead centre {{positions}} is used to find the mid gear position of the pivot between the combination rod and reach rod. In practice the <b>valve</b> <b>spindle</b> length is adjusted to ensure this as part of setting the timing. Also the dimensions of the lead and lap lever are set so that the valve moves twice the lead + lap of the valve.|$|E
500|$|The Gresley 3-cylinder drive {{arrangement}} continued {{to bring a}} number of practical problems, the root of which was probably {{the need for the}} inside cylinder to be steeply inclined in order to give space for the inside connecting rod to clear the leading coupled axle; at the same time, the inside <b>valve</b> <b>spindle</b> had to be parallel with the outside ones from which it derived its motion. This problem had been overcome by what Holcroft called a [...] "twist in the ports" [...] (the passages that carried steam {{in and out of the}} cylinders). A consequence was that the length of these passages was greater than that generally recommended, increasing [...] "dead space", and this was combined with a shorter exhaust passage. The net result would be rather different working conditions in the middle cylinder from those on the outside. A contributing problem was that any elongation of the outside valve spindles was multiplied by the conjugated valve gear. Although this had been anticipated at the design stage, the overall consequence was that the inside cylinder had a tendency to give more power than the other two as speed increased, leading to the overloading of the inside connecting rod bearings, especially the big-end which was liable to overheat and fail. Various experiments were tried over the years to cure this chronic ailment, and it was only towards the end of the steam era that a real solution was found in Great Western methods of lubrication and manufacture for the big-end bearing. Other problems persisted, such as a stiff, insensitive regulator and overall design flaws that hampered maintenance.|$|E

25|$|Holcroft’s {{process of}} driving the middle {{cylinder}} {{directly from the}} combination lever contrasted to the approach taken by Sir Nigel Gresley, who used {{an extension of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>spindles</b> on the outside valve gear to operate the middle cylinders of his locomotives. This variant therefore held an advantage over Gresley’s design, as the Holcroft valve gear would be immune to variations in valve events brought about by heat expansion of the <b>valve</b> <b>spindles</b> and flexing of the conjugation levers when in heavy use.|$|R
2500|$|The {{valve gear}} {{assembly}} originally designed by Holcroft {{for use on}} the N1 class regulated {{the timing of the}} valve events that admitted steam into the cylinder, increasing efficiency whilst reducing mechanical wear and the effects of hammerblow on the track. Holcroft incorporated a new method of driving the middle cylinder from the right-hand set of the two outside Walschaerts valve gear without the need to use a separate set of valve gear between the frames, saving overall weight. This was achieved by using the combination lever assembly that controlled the fore and aft movement of the <b>valve</b> <b>spindle,</b> which admitted [...] "live" [...] steam into the cylinder and ejected [...] "spent" [...] steam through the ports.|$|E

5000|$|In larger steam {{turbines}} an oil operated servo mechanism {{is used in}} order to enhance the lever sensitivity. The use of a relay system magnifies the small deflections of the lever connected to the governor sleeve. The differential lever is connected at both the ends to the governor sleeve and the throttle <b>valve</b> <b>spindle</b> respectively. The pilot valves spindle is also connected to the same lever at some intermediate position. Both the pilot valves cover one port each in the oil chamber. The outlets of the oil chamber are connected to an oil drain tank through pipes.The decrease in load during operation of the turbine will bring about increase in the shaft speed thereby lifting the governor sleeve. Deflection occurs in the lever and due to this the pilot <b>valve</b> <b>spindle</b> raises up opening the upper port for oil entry and lower port for oil exit. Pressurized oil from the oil tank enters the cylinder and pushes the relay piston downwards. As the relay piston moves the throttle <b>valve</b> <b>spindle</b> attached to it also descends and partially closes the valve. Thus the steam flow rates can be controlled. When the load on the turbine increases the deflections in the lever are such that the lower port is opened for oil entry and upper port for oil exit. The relay piston moves upwards and the throttle <b>valve</b> <b>spindle</b> ascend upwards opening the valve.The variation of the steam consumption rate ṁ (kg/h) with the turbine load during throttle governing is linear and is given by the “willan’s line”. The equation for the willan’s line is given by: ...|$|E
50|$|All coupled wheels were flanged. The axle {{boxes of}} the leading and {{trailing}} wheels were equipped with roller bearings while the solid bronze coupled wheel axle boxes were soft grease-lubricated. Soft grease lubrication was used throughout for the motion gear, except the piston rods, <b>valve</b> <b>spindles</b> and main crossheads which were oil-lubricated. Two four-feed sight lubricators, arranged in the cab, supplied oil to the steam chests and cylinders.|$|R
50|$|He {{collaborated with}} Nigel Gresley {{to develop the}} Gresley {{conjugated}} valve gear for 3-cylinder locomotives as fitted to LNER 3 cylinder locomotives. Holcroft continued to develop this mechanism by driving the middle cylinder gear of a steam locomotive from the outside cylinder combination levers, as opposed to Gresley's method of using direct transmission from the front <b>valve</b> <b>spindles.</b> This was necessary {{in the case of}} the SECR / SR Moguls because there was insufficient space for Holcroft's original gear to fit between the cylinder leading wheels and first drivers. Holcroft's method had a number of advantages. The Gresley design of conjugated valve gear suffered from variations in valve events brought about by heat expansion of the <b>valve</b> <b>spindles</b> and flexing of the combination lever - even after considerable re-design of the lever and pivot bracket, affecting the valve events when the locomotive was under way. By using the combination lever assembly to drive the middle cylinder, Holcroft managed to circumvent these problems. Subsequently the problem of flexure and lost motion caused the gear to be removed from the SR Moguls in 1931, to be replaced by a third set of Walschaerts gear, as allowed for in the original design.|$|R
50|$|The axle {{boxes of}} the leading and {{trailing}} wheels on each engine unit were equipped with roller bearings while the solid bronze coupled wheel axle boxes were fitted with Ajax grease lubrication systems. Soft grease lubrication was used throughout for the motion gear, except the piston rods, <b>valve</b> <b>spindles</b> and main crossheads which were oil-lubricated. Two four-feed sight lubricators, arranged in the cab, supplied oil to the steam chests, cylinders and the ball joint of the main steam pipes on each engine unit.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} form of gab {{valve gear}} or 'gab clutch' {{was a simple}} notch in the valve rod, where it hooked over the <b>valve</b> <b>spindle.</b> A hand lever allowed this notch to be lifted, thus disengaging the valve drive and promptly stopping the engine.|$|E
50|$|The Trofimoff valve {{comprises}} the <b>valve</b> <b>spindle,</b> the piston valve heads slotted onto {{them and the}} two supporting plates (Stützplatten). When the engine is running under load the valve heads are forced by steam pressure onto the support plates and work like standard pistons (Regelkolbenschieber). If steam admission ceases or, on a steam locomotive, the regulator is closed, the pressure drops, the valve heads remain in the inside dead centre position near {{the centre of the}} cylinder due to the tension of the piston rings. The <b>valve</b> <b>spindle</b> continues to move backwards and forwards with the support plates attached to it, without disturbing the valve heads. In this way, perfect pressure balance is achieved, thus ensuring excellent light-running conditions for the steam engine or locomotive.|$|E
50|$|The final {{form of the}} gab {{valve gear}} was the 'closed' gab. Like the X-gab, this was a coupled pair of gabs, {{although}} in this case they faced inwards {{and there was a}} single pin between them. Once again, the gabs were driven by the eccentrics and the pin drove the <b>valve</b> <b>spindle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Holcroft {{valve gear}} was {{a type of}} {{conjugated}} valve gear designed by Harold Holcroft and used on three-cylinder steam locomotives of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR). It bore many similarities to the Gresley conjugated valve gear used on the original LNER A1 design. It varied from the Gresley method of operation by using the combination lever assembly instead of the <b>valve</b> <b>spindles</b> to drive the middle cylinder of a three-cylinder design. This had operational advantages over Gresley's design.|$|R
25|$|VR {{designers}} {{wished to}} improve on aspects of the earlier S class design. These three-cylinder Pacifics, although capable of hauling heavy loads at high speed, had proved to be relatively maintenance-intensive, {{particularly with regard to}} the servicing of the valve gear and motion for their third (inside) cylinder. The Gresley conjugated valve gear, driven from the <b>valve</b> <b>spindles</b> of the outside cylinder piston valves, was prone to heat expansion and wear, causing timing difficulties, and required dismantling and removal whenever the centre cylinder valve required service.|$|R
50|$|Number 7 {{was built}} in 1886 at Swindon as a tandem {{compound}} 2-4-0 with 7 ft coupled wheels and outside frames. The 23 in diameter low pressure cylinders were {{in front of the}} high pressure cylinders, the pistons being carried on the same piston rod. Valves for the low pressure cylinders were below, and those for the high pressure cylinders above the cylinders. One set of valve gear drove each pair of <b>valve</b> <b>spindles.</b> This setup proved difficult to access for maintenance, and the locomotive was relegated to minor routes. It was broken up in 1890. The wheel centres were used in building No. 7 of the Armstrong class.|$|R
50|$|The Trofimoff {{piston valve}} {{consisted}} of two fixed discs secured to the <b>valve</b> <b>spindle,</b> and two junk rings, each carrying a bull ring and four valve rings and both free to move longitudinally on the spindle. When the regulator is opened, steam forces the loose valve bodies against their respective fixed discs and they then act as units, similar to ordinary piston valves. When steam is shut off, the loose valve heads become detached from their respective discs and remain in their idle positions near {{the centre of the}} steam chest, while the <b>valve</b> <b>spindle</b> and fixed disks continue their reciprocating motion with the spindle sliding freely through the now stationary loose valve heads, and with the steam and exhaust ports now in communi&shy;ca&shy;tion. With both ends of the cylinders now in communication, the use of ordinary by-bass or snifting valves became unnecessary.|$|E

Left is a supporting element. When fitted, the valve bodies are exactly centred by the valve chest and the spindle through the housing (Tragbuchsen), so that the rod can move freely through the valve heads.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} {{self-acting}} valve gears used for steam engines was the eccentric valve gear. This placed an eccentric on the engine's crankshaft, that in turn drove a strap and a long rod to the <b>valve's</b> actuating <b>spindle.</b> This was a simple valve gear but worked well for rotative engines that ran continuously for long periods, and in only one direction. For early mill engines this was acceptable.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{a number}} of issues with the Gresley gear. Because the {{conjugation}} apparatus was mounted {{at the opposite end of}} the <b>valve</b> <b>spindles</b> from the <b>valve</b> gear, as the <b>valve</b> <b>spindles</b> lengthened with the heat of steam in the cylinders the valve timing would be affected, and the gear would need to be removed before it was possible to remove valves for maintenance. However, the B17 Class [...] "Footballer"/"Sandringham" [...] 4-6-0s avoided this particular problem by being designed with the conjugated gear behind, rather than in front of, the cylinders. The main difficulty with this valve gear was that at high speeds, inertial forces caused the long conjugating lever to bend or [...] "whip". This had the effect of causing the middle cylinder to operate at a longer cutoff than the outer cylinders, therefore producing a disproportionate share of the total power output, leading to increased wear of the middle big end. Sustained high speed running could sometimes cause the big end to wear rapidly enough that the increased travel afforded to the middle piston by the increased play in the bearing was enough to knock the ends off the middle cylinder. This happened during the 113 mph run of [...] "Silver Fox". Although the problem could be contained in a peacetime environment with regular maintenance and inspections, it proved to be poorly suited to the rigors of heavy running and low maintenance levels of World War II. This gave rise to big-end problems on the centre cylinder connecting rod on the famous A4 class of streamlined Pacifics and many of these locomotives were fitted with a reduced diameter piston and had the inside cylinder sleeved down as a temporary measure. It should be noted that LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard suffered centre cylinder big-end damage (indicated to the driver by the fracture of a [...] "stink bomb" [...] attached to the bearing, which fractures during overheating of the white metal) during its world record run and was forced to limp back to its depot for repairs afterwards. Gresley's successor at the LNER, Edward Thompson, was critical of this particular valve gear. As well as introducing new two-cylinder designs, he set about rebuilding Gresley locomotives with separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear for each cylinder.Under later British Railways ownership, the application of former Great Western Railway workshop practices for precise alignment of the valve gear and in the manufacture and lubrication of the inside big end bearing effectively solved the problems.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the best-known}} {{examples}} of the steeple engine was the Willans engine. These were double- or triple-expansion compound engines, with the unusual features of single-acting cylinders and a central <b>spindle</b> <b>valve</b> shared between all cylinders. By around 1900, more of the Willans type were in service for electrical generation than any other type.|$|R
50|$|The {{diesel engines}} failed {{immediately}} as seawater flooded their air intakes. The machinist {{in the fifth}} compartment who discovered the flooding became confused by the complex array of valves, and did not shut the ventilation flapper valve quickly enough. By the time he located the correct handwheel, the <b>valve</b> <b>spindle</b> had been bent {{by the force of}} the flooding water. As the compartment filled, the boat's trim became uncontrollable.|$|E
50|$|The valvegear {{actuating}} the valve was very simple. Each piston had two parallel connecting rods, working on separated crankpin journals between the same crank webs. An eccentric {{between the two}} crankpins drove the centrally-mounted <b>valve</b> <b>spindle</b> by another short connecting rod. Because {{of the need to}} allow the valve rod to pass through between them, the piston had two overhung stub gudgeon pins, rather than a single through pin.|$|E
5000|$|When {{it proved}} {{impractical}} {{to mount the}} conjugation apparatus behind the cylinders on the N1 Holcroft had to revise the design to have the apparatus {{in front of the}} cylinders. He did not wish to use an extension of the valve spindles, as on Gresley conjugated valve gear. Instead, Holcroft carried-forward the action of the combination lever assembly that controlled the fore and aft movement of the <b>valve</b> <b>spindle</b> (which admitted [...] "live" [...] steam into the cylinder and ejected [...] "spent" [...] steam out through the ports) to a pivot point connected to a lever from the [...] "inside" [...] <b>valve</b> <b>spindle.</b> The Holcroft variant held an advantage over Gresley’s [...] "conjugated" [...] design, as the valve timing was immune to variations brought about by heat expansion of the valve spindles and flexing of the conjugation assembly when under heavy use. It also had potential maintenance benefits because most of the conjugation mechanism was located outside the locomotive frames and could thus be accessed without an inspection pit.|$|E
500|$|Holcroft’s {{valve gear}} design {{was also an}} attempt to address the {{problems}} associated with Gresley’s conjugated valve gear, which was prone to variations in valve events caused by heat expansion of the <b>valve</b> <b>spindles</b> within the pistons. The design utilised the motion of the outside valve rods (the rods transmitting the motion of the driving axles to the valves, such as the combination lever) instead, although the restricted space between the back of the outside cylinders and the front driving wheels made it impossible to locate the rocking arms controlling the conjugating mechanism in the vicinity. Holcroft’s solution was to move the mechanism to a position above the pony truck and ahead of the cylinders and link it to the outside valve rods with extension levers, which had to be accommodated within the strict SECR loading gauge tolerances. This necessitated a new design of cylinder block whereby the outside steam chests were set inwards {{and the size of the}} cylinders reduced to [...] stroke and diameter. [...] The sides of the outside cylinders consequently sloped inwards towards the top in a configuration similar to GWR 2-cylinder locomotives, thus providing ample space in which to accommodate the extension levers. The inside cylinder and conjugation assembly were set at an incline of 1 in 8 to clear the front pony truck, leaving space for a third set of independent Walschaerts valve gear between the frames should Holcroft’s conjugation mechanism prove unreliable in service.|$|R
50|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} engine was its central <b>spindle</b> <b>valve.</b> This acted as a multi-stage piston valve, controlling admission of steam into each of the compound cylinders. Unusually the valve worked within the hollow piston rod or trunk, {{rather than in the}} cylinder block or valvechest. This hollow piston rod linked all of the cylinders and was machined with ports.|$|R
50|$|Willans' {{engine was}} one of the best-known {{examples}} of the steeple compound engine. These were double- or triple-expansion compound engines, with the unusual features of single-acting cylinders and a central <b>spindle</b> <b>valve</b> shared between all the cylinders of that spindle. The cylinders are arranged as tandem compounds, with high- and low-pressure cylinders mounted on the same vertical shaft. This vertical arrangement of the steeple compound gives a compact floor layout for an engine of such power.|$|R
5000|$|The {{support plates}} {{fixed to the}} <b>valve</b> <b>spindle</b> also have a piston ring. This slows down {{the closing of the}} movable valve heads.Narrow gauge {{locomotives}} (such as the DR Class 99.23-24) do not have these piston rings. As a result, when the locomotive switches from running light to running under load there is a characteristic clicking noise as the pistons close. This piston ring on the support body was a further refinement by the former Meiningen repair shop.|$|E
50|$|Next, {{the fact}} that in midgear the valve opening should be the same for the piston in both front and rear dead centre {{positions}} is used to find the mid gear position of the pivot between the combination rod and reach rod. In practice the <b>valve</b> <b>spindle</b> length is adjusted to ensure this as part of setting the timing. Also the dimensions of the lead and lap lever are set so that the valve moves twice the lead + lap of the valve.|$|E
50|$|Other visible {{differences}} are larger mechanical lubricators and external {{drive from the}} <b>valve</b> <b>spindle,</b> a vacuum ejector exhaust muffler {{just in front of}} the safety valves, pipes conveying exhaust and ejector steam to the ashpan for mixing with the primary air, the secondary air inlets in the firebox sides with spark arresting plates outside them, and the snifting and bypass valves which were removed and blanked off since the modified locomotive drifted in mid-gear with steam supplied from the drifting valve.|$|E
5000|$|For {{laboratory}} glassware, items {{sometimes have}} plug valves with conically-tapered inserts called stopcocks (sometimes {{referred to as}} [...] "plugs" [...] by laypeople) with different bores. The valve bodies are usually made of glass, while the plugs are made of glass or Teflon. One also can find <b>valves</b> with Teflon <b>spindle</b> (for example one way valves or angled valves) When the plug is made of glass, the handle and plug are fused together in one piece out of glass. When both valve body and plug are made of glass, a suitable grease (e.g. silicone grease or Ramsay grease) is usually used to give a good seal, {{as well as to}} prevent the valve from seizing and subsequently cracking.|$|R
40|$|Various {{components}} of steam turbines {{are subjected to}} limited service life due to severe forms of wear. In particular valve head and seat faces often suffer from extensive wear causing leakage of steam flow and loss of operating efficiency and eventually may lead to total shut down of the plant. Therefore reliable and efficient operation of a power plant is heavily dependent on the surface engineering properties of these critical components. This study examines the erosion mechanism observed in various valve bodies used in steam turbines. It also reports various metal deposition processes to refurbish damaged surface regions with novel alloys. This study {{has shown that the}} dominant form of wear is by erosion caused by oxide particles that are present in the steam. It has also been found that <b>valve</b> discs and <b>spindles</b> suffered from sliding wear. Metal deposition using high power industrial laser and plasma transferred arc (PTA) were used to deposit cobalt, nickel and iron based superalloys onto the steel substrate. Surface engineering properties of the deposits obtained by particle impingement erosion test are reported in this study...|$|R
5000|$|To {{light the}} stove, {{the fuel tank}} must first be {{pre-heated}} and pressurized by lighting {{a small amount of}} fuel poured into the primer pan or spirit cup (a small well) on top of the tank {{at the base of the}} vaporizer (the vertical stem connecting the fuel tank to the burner). Alternatively, the primer pan can be filled directly from the fuel tank by opening the control valve and warming the fuel tank by holding it in one’s hands. This will increase the pressure in the fuel tank and force a small amount of fuel to trickle out of the burner jet and into the primer pan. [...] The control valve must then be closed before lighting the priming fuel so as to allow pressure to build up in the tank when the exterior fuel begins to heat the tank and the fuel within. The tank can also be pressurized by an optional pump that may be attached to the filler cap, but this is generally not necessary except in extreme cold. Fuel from the tank is fed by a cotton wick inside the tank to the base of the vaporizer. The heat and pressure created by the priming flame vaporizes the fuel inside the vaporizer. When the priming flame is nearly burnt out, the control valve is opened by turning the adjusting key. This allows the vaporized fuel to flow under pressure through the burner jet (a small opening at the base of the burner), where it mixes with oxygen and burns with a blue flame. Adjusting the flow of the vaporized fuel that is forced through the burner jet controls the flame size and heat output. The control <b>valve</b> (a <b>spindle)</b> is threaded in the vaporizer's housing, and as it is opened (by turning the adjusting key) it opens like a faucet (counter-clockwise to open and clockwise to close) and the vaporized fuel flows through the burner jet. Closing the spindle closes the fuel supply. A small plate on the top of the burner (a flame spreader) spreads the flame outwards. The heat generated in the burner and vaporizer maintains the internal pressure in the fuel tank.|$|R
