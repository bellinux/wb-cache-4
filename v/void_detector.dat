40|$|Variations in {{the steam}} bubble distribution, the "void " distribution, in a boiling channel as a {{function}} of changes in heating power was studied. A rectangular test tube, of cross section 1. 11 x 4. 44 cm and height 127 cm, was inserted in a forced circulation pressure loop. The tube was heated by passing an AC current through the tube walls. A power oscillator was built which could give a 10 % peak-to-peak sinusoidal power modulation at any frequency in the interval 0. 01 to 10 cycles per second. Variations in steam volume fraction were observed by means of a gamma densitometer built for the purpose. Accurate void profiles could be taken by traversing the test channel vertically and horizontally. With the <b>void</b> <b>detector</b> stationary at a given height, the amplitude and phase delay of the steam void variations were measured in the frequency range mentioned. The signal from the gamma detector was passed to a harmonic analyzer built for the experiment. This instrument could pick out the void variations coherent with the power variation, in the presence of much greater random signa...|$|E
40|$|Liquid scintillators {{are used}} widely for neutron {{detection}} {{and for the}} assay of nuclear materials. However, due to the constituents of the detector and the nitrogen <b>void</b> within the <b>detector</b> cell, usually incorporated to accommodate any expansion that might occur to avoid leakage, fluctuations in detector response have been observed associated with {{the orientation of the}} detector when in use. In this work the angular dependence of the pulse-shape discrimination performance in an EJ 309 liquid scintillator has been investigated with 252 Cf in terms of the separation of γ-ray and neutron events, described quantitatively by the figure-of-merit. A subtle dependence in terms of pulse-shape discrimination is observed. In contrast, a more significant dependence of detection sensitivity with the angle of orientation is evident...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of two-phase flow parameters {{has never been}} an easy task in the experimental thermal-hydraulics and the need of such measurements in the SPES 3 facility has led to investigation of different possibilities and evaluation methods to determine mass flows and energies. This paper deals with the theoretical prediction of the two-phase mass flow rate {{by the development of}} a mathematical model for a spool piece, consisting of a drag disk, a turbine and a <b>void</b> fraction <b>detector.</b> Data obtained by simulation of DBAs in the SPES 3 facility, with the RELAP 5 thermal-hydraulic code, have provided the reference conditions for defining the main thermal-hydraulic parameter ranges and selecting a set of instruments potentially suitable to measure and derive the required quantities. The governing equation and the instrumentation output are defined for each device. Three different turbine models (Aya, Rouhani and volumetric) have been studied to understand which one better adapts to two-phase flow conditions and to investigate the best instrument combination. The mathematical model has been tested versus the RELAP 5 results with a reverse process where calculated variables, like void fraction, quality and slip ratio, are given as input to a specifically developed program to get back the mass flow rate. The analytical results, verified versus the DVI break transient, well agree with the RELAP 5 mass flow rate. Specific tests on proper experimental loops are required to verify the analytical studies...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{improvements}} are being sought to identify {{special nuclear material}} more accurately. Active interrogation is a current field of research for this application, capable of penetrating shielding materials but which can feature a complex and challenging radiation field for detectors to operate in. This research was aimed at improving active interrogation techniques further by optimising experimental setups and procedures and reducing undesirable dead periods of acquisition which may be observed. The important outcomes from this research are listed below: • The {{creation of a new}} empirical fit to better represent the rising edge of pulses from both neutrons and gamma rays than the currently used Marrone fit (suited to the decay tail of pulses). • The ability to clearly distinguish a selection of gamma rays using this rise time technique post-processing previously acquired data consisting of a mixed radiation field. • The effect of angular orientation of liquid scintillators on FoM values after performing PSD techniques has been identified as well as sensitivity issues associated with the position of the nitrogen <b>void</b> within these <b>detectors.</b> • A novel gated organic plastic scintillator detector has been operated and controlled using a trigger circuit devised in this research. This circuit controlled whether the gated detector was active through the presence of light. • A radiation based detector was integrated with this trigger circuit controlling the gated detector by making the device inactive whenever a radiation count was observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{patients}} with the neuroendocrine tumours (liver, spleen, etc.) often need treatment by the Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy with 177 Lu. The amount of 177 Lu activity {{in the body of}} patients has to be known accurately for assessment of the dosimetry and for evaluation of the effectiveness of the therapy. Whole-body activities at the given time after administration can be derived from measurements of the activity of a sub-sample from the excreted urine, collected by the patient him/herself. This approach has to be abandoned because it increases the radiation dose of analysts and nurses involved. Moreover, the collection is patient unfriendly; there is a high risk of contamination by spills, and therefore, a risk of incomplete collection. As such, it is not unlikely that the urine collection method results in an underestimated indication of the total amount of activity actually excreted. As a consequence, the urine collection method may render an overestimated value of the whole-body activity. On the other hand, it is an intrinsic problem that the measurement uncertainty of the whole-body activity derived from the urine collection method increases when the whole-body activity decreases with time. As an example, the expanded uncertainties of the whole-body activity were about ± 4 % (the coverage factor k= 2) shortly after administration and up to >± 20 % at 24 h; however all expanded uncertainties of the activity of the collected urine were about ± 3. 4 %. The objective of the research described in this thesis was to develop a patient friendly technique for an accurate estimate of the whole-body activity of 177 Lu as an alternative for the collection of the excreted urine by patient themselves. Two methods, (i) direct measurement of the activity of the excreted urine in the toilet pot and (ii) paired whole-body measurements, have been developed to overcome the concerns. In the first method, the activity of the excreted urine was measured in the toilet pot itself. A small CeBr 3 detector is positioned on the side wall of the toilet room, aligned to centre of the water in the toilet pot. The patient uses the toilet as normal but does not need to flush it. The only modification for the current toilet system is to replace the mechanical flushing by a delayed flushing. The activity of the excreted urine is measured directly in the toilet pot after the patient has left the room. This approach is friendly and comfortable for patients and does not lead to an enhanced radiation dose to the staff that otherwise need handling the collected urine. The effects of urine volume and the voiding flow rate were investigated with 177 Lu mock-up urine solutions. The expanded uncertainty varied from ± 5 to ± 10 %, dependent on the occurrence of diarrhea or extreme voiding styles. Therefore measurement uncertainties of the derived whole-body activity were equivalent to the values derived from the urine collection method or even a little bit worse. As an alternative, a radiation measurement system was designed by which the activity in the patient’s body can be measured directly by positioning the patient between two CeBr 3 detectors for simultaneous measurements. Whole-body activities during subsequent measurements are commonly normalized to the administered activity before the first <b>voiding.</b> The <b>detector</b> responses of the measurement system are affected by the fully filled bladder during this measurement before the first voiding and by activity redistributions in between subsequent measurements. This was confirmed by measurements with patients, in which the geometric mean value of the count rates of the two <b>detectors</b> after <b>voiding</b> differed from that before the next voiding and by comparison with the results from the urine collection method. This problem could be largely overcome by a series of paired measurements before and after each voiding consecutively, from which time-dependent detector responses were derived. The whole-body activities were then determined accurately using these time-dependent responses, with measurement uncertainties of about ± 7 %. The results around 1 h after administration have been validated by measurements of the collected first excreted urine from 5 patients. The uncertainty of the whole-body dose is an essential quantity in the individual dosimetry of radionuclide therapy and is mainly dependent on the time-integrated activity coefficient, which is calculated by the bi-exponential regression of the time-activity curve. Using the trapezoidal area under the measurement curve as a reference, the uncertainty of the time-integrated activity coefficient was estimated from the three components, e. g. the uncertainty of the trapezoidal area under the measurement curve, the sum of squares of fitting residuals and the bias between the fitting and trapezoidal areas. The expanded uncertainty in measurement is about ± 4 % for the new paired measurements method. The toilet measurement set-up is in principle ready for implementation but requires additional modifications of the logistics {{in the use of the}} toilet, such as a delayed flushing and blocking of the access during the measurements. The whole-body measurement system is ready for implementation. Handling of radioactive urine is not needed any more. The approaches meet the objective: a reduction of the burden to radiotherapy patients and analysts in the assays of the amount of activity in the patient body.
