Core algorithms {{have been designed to}} be executable also on videoboardâ€™s GPU, thus taking advantage of parallel matrix and vector computational power. Although complex physical simulation has been simplified to run on GPUs, results are characterized by high <b>visio-tactile</b> realism perceived by users. Graphical rendering algorithms can be easily added to pre-existing vertex shaders/programs. The proposed method makes use of common triangular meshes, thus making the method a good choice when adding haptic feedback to existing graphical applications. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{actuated}} shape-changing {{interface with}} fast response and small pixel size using a liquid material can provide real time tangible {{interaction with the}} digital world in physical space. To this end, we demonstrate an interface that displays userdefined patterns dynamically using liquid metal droplets as programmable micro robots on a flat surface. We built a prototype using an array of embedded electrodes and a switching circuit to control the jump of the droplets from electrode to electrode. The actuation and dynamics of the droplets under the finger provides mild tactile feedback to the user. Our demo {{is the first to}} show a planar <b>visio-tactile</b> display using liquid metal, and is a first step to make shape-changing physical ephemeral widgets on a tabletop interface...|$|E
