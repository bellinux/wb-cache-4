5|$|Halo 3 {{does not}} {{natively}} render at true HD resolution (at least 720 lines of <b>vertical</b> <b>resolution).</b> In a Bungie Weekly Update, it was {{confirmed that the}} game renders at 1152×640 resolution instead of the usual 1280×720 (HD) resolution that most Xbox 360 games use. This is because Halo 3 uses two frame buffers instead of the usual one, so the lower resolution allowed Bungie to preserve as much of the dynamic range as possible for the game's lighting without adversely affecting the frame rate. The image can be upscaled to 1080p by the Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, YouTube {{introduced}} videos {{playing at}} 60 frames per second, {{in order to}} reproduce video games with a frame rate comparable to high-end graphics cards. The videos play back at a resolution of 720p or higher. YouTube videos are available {{in a range of}} quality levels. The former names of standard quality (SQ), high quality (HQ), and high definition (HD) have been replaced by numerical values representing the <b>vertical</b> <b>resolution</b> of the video. The default video stream is encoded in the VP9 format with stereo Opus audio; if VP9/WebM is not supported in the browser/device or the browser's user agent reports Windows XP, then H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video with stereo AAC audio is used instead.|$|E
25|$|The 352x240 and 352x288 (or SIF) resolutions {{were chosen}} {{because it is}} half the {{horizontal}} and <b>vertical</b> <b>resolution</b> of NTSC video, and half the horizontal resolution of PAL (the <b>vertical</b> <b>resolution</b> of PAL already being half of the 576 active lines). This is approximately half the resolution of an analog VHS tape which is ~330 horizontal and 480 vertical (NTSC) or 330x576 (PAL).|$|E

25|$|Television {{broadcasts}} {{were suspended}} during Great Patriotic War. In 1944, while {{the war was}} still raging, a new standard, offering 625 lines of <b>vertical</b> <b>resolution</b> was prepared. This format was ultimately accepted as a national standard.|$|E
25|$|The FCC adopted NTSC {{television}} engineering {{standards on}} May 2, 1941, calling for 525 lines of <b>vertical</b> <b>resolution,</b> 30 {{frames per second}} with interlaced scanning, 60 fields per second, and sound carried by frequency modulation. Sets sold since 1939 that were built for slightly lower resolution could still be adjusted to receive the new standard. (Dunlap, p31). The FCC saw television ready for commercial licensing, and the first such licenses were issued to NBC- and CBS-owned stations in New York on July 1, 1941, followed by Philco's station WPTZ in Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|At a minimum, all digital {{television}} broadcasters in Australia provide a 576i [...] standard-definition service, {{in addition to}} high definition. The 576p50 format is also considered a HDTV format, as it has higher <b>vertical</b> <b>resolution</b> {{through the use of}} progressive scanning. When Australia started DVB-T in 2001 several networks broadcast high-definition in a 576p format as this could give better quality on 50Hz scanning CRT TVs and was not as demanding on MPEG-2-bit-rate. Since many modern television sets have an interlace to progressive scan conversion there is little difference in picture quality. MPEG-2 encoders have also improved so the more conventional 720p and 1080i formats are now used.|$|E

40|$|Matrices {{corresponding}} to a revised vertical grid are {{shown to be}} derived from the original grid by integrating the radiative cooling rate over model layers. The method is applied to temperature profiles that represent average or extreme atmospheric conditions and a range of <b>vertical</b> <b>resolutions.</b> The example makes use of the 15 -micron CO 2 band parameterization proposed by Akmaev and Shved (1982) for the LTE region of the middle atmosphere. Cooling rate errors provided by the present method are not more than 0. 11 K/day for a vertical grid spacing of less than 5 km. The matrix transformation method is shown to be valuable for adapting effective matrix parameterizations of middle atmosphere cooling to atmospheric models with arbitrary <b>vertical</b> <b>resolutions...</b>|$|R
500|$|A {{cross-section}} of the three-dimensional reflectivity of a thunderstorm shows the vault better. Algorithms {{were developed by}} the J.S. Marshall Radar Observatory of McGill University in Canada to locate the overhang region in a thunderstorm by the late 1980s. Its radar uses 24 angles, giving it good <b>vertical</b> <b>resolution.</b> In United States, fewer scanning angles are made within the WSR-88D radar which {{makes it more difficult}} to detect the overhang. [...] Once the overhang is located, it is possible to make a cross-section to view if it is related with a BWER. However, since 1997 algorithms have been developed by the National Weather Service to determine regions of reflectivity gradient in three dimensions and the presence of BWER in convection.|$|E

[...] The shear wave splitting measurements have extensive lateral resolution but very poor <b>vertical</b> <b>resolution.</b> [...] The polarizations of shear waves vary throughout the rock mass. Therefore, the observed polarizations may be those of the near surface structure and are not necessarily representative of the structure of interest.|$|E

5000|$|For instance, a 2K {{image is}} 2048 pixels wide, and a 4K image is 4096 pixels wide. <b>Vertical</b> <b>resolutions</b> vary with aspect ratios though; so a 2K image with an HDTV (16:9) aspect ratio is 2048×1152 pixels, while a 2K image with a SDTV or Academy ratio (4:3) is 2048×1536 pixels, {{and one with}} a Panavision ratio (2.39:1) would be 2048×856 pixels, and so on. Due to the [...] "nK" [...] {{notation}} not corresponding to specific horizontal resolutions per format a 2K image lacking, for example, the typical 35mm film soundtrack space, is only 1828 pixels wide, with <b>vertical</b> <b>resolutions</b> rescaling accordingly. This led to a plethora of motion-picture related video resolutions, which is quite confusing and often redundant with respect to nowadays few projection standards.|$|R
