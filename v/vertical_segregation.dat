Horizontal segregation occurs when certain occupations are more female intensive. For example, more Jordanian men are civil servants and fill high-ranking positions while Jordanian women are concentrated in middle-ranking jobs. The consequences of women’s limited economic advancement and low female participation in the workforce leads to low utilization of national production capacity (World Bank estimates it is currently at half its potential), lower average household income and lower per capita GDP. The greatest challenge to incorporating women equally into the workplace is overcoming traditional attitudes towards women and their expected duties as mothers and wives.

40|$|In this paper, we {{illustrate}} {{laboratory experiments}} whose {{purpose is to}} study the <b>vertical</b> <b>segregations</b> that are commonly observed in deposits of dense geophysical flows (such as pyroclastic flows and rock avalanches). In these experiments, we use rock cuboids with 5 mm long edges as matrix and rock cuboids with 2 cm long edges as segregating clasts. A rotating disk is used to apply frictional stresses {{at the base of}} the granular masses. In our experiments, segregating cuboids with density smaller than or equal to that of the matrix particles rise whereas segregating cuboidswith density larger than that of the matrix particles sink. The granular flows are imaged through the glass container of the experimental apparatus by a high-speed video camera at 2000 fps. By means of particle image velocimetry analysis of the movies, we study the vertical gradient of particle agitation that exists within the granular flows where agitation increases downward because of the interaction with the subsurface asperities. The high-speed movies show that it is the particle agitation within the flows that exerts an upward force and that, when this force is larger than theweight of the segregating clast, the clast riseswhereas, when it is smaller, the clast sinks. The most important result in our set of experiments is that the threshold which separates the values of density of the segregating clasts that segregate upward and the values of density of the segregating clasts that segregate downward is larger than the density of the matrix particles. This explains the upward segregation of dense lithics that is frequently observed in deposits of geophysical flows. This upward segregation is due to the fact that the resultant of the collisions exerted by the matrix particles is a force strong enough to push upward also dense and heavy fragments...|$|R
40|$|The nanomorphologies of {{the bulk}} {{heterojunction}} (BHJ) layer of polymer solar cells are extremely {{sensitive to the}} electrode materials and thermal annealing conditions. In this work, the correlations of electrode materials, thermal annealing sequences, and resultant BHJ nanomorphological details of P 3 HT:PCBM BHJ polymer solar cell are studied {{by a series of}} large-scale, coarse-grained (CG) molecular simulations of system comprised of PEDOT:PSS/P 3 HT:PCBM/Al layers. Simulations are performed for various configurations of electrode materials as well as processing temperature. The complex CG molecular data are characterized using a novel extension of our graph-based framework to quantify morphology and establish a link between morphology and processing conditions. Our analysis indicates that <b>vertical</b> phase <b>segregation</b> of P 3 HT:PCBM blend strongly depends on the electrode material and thermal annealing schedule. A thin P 3 HT-rich film is formed on the top, regardless of bottom electrode material, when the BHJ layer is exposed to the free surface during thermal annealing. In addition, preferential segregation of P 3 HT chains and PCBM molecules toward PEDOT:PSS and Al electrodes, respectively, is observed. Detailed morphology analysis indicated that, surprisingly, <b>vertical</b> phase <b>segregation</b> does not affect the connectivity of donor/acceptor domains with respective electrodes. However, the formation of P 3 HT/PCBM depletion zones next to the P 3 HT/PCBM-rich zones can be a potential bottleneck for electron/hole transport due to increase in transport pathway length. Analysis in terms of fraction of intra- and interchain charge transports revealed that processing schedule affects the average vertical orientation of polymer chains, which may be crucial for enhanced charge transport, nongeminate recombination, and charge collection. The present study establishes a more detailed link between processing and morphology by combining multiscale molecular simulation framework with an extensive morphology feature analysis, providing a quantitative means for process optimization...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to {{understand}} and analyze the present situation of gender equality in politics in the Philippines, investigate women's opportunities to be politically active and to exercise political influence. Finally {{find out if there}} is a difference in horizontal and vertical positions between women's and men's representation in politics and investigate further possibilities and problems that might be associated with women's political representation in the Philippines. The empirical material for this thesis has been gathered through qualitative interviews with male and female politicians from Manila, the capital of the Philippines. The theoretical framework is divided into different parts which are used to analyse various points from the empirical material. In this chapter, we included theories about differences between gender experiences and why women should be politically active.
