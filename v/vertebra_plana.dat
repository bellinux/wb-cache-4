40|$|Vertebral eosinophilic {{granuloma}} {{is a rare}} condition frequently associated with <b>vertebra</b> <b>plana.</b> In this paper we present six patients with {{eosinophilic granuloma}} of the spine; three were without <b>vertebra</b> <b>plana,</b> which represents a diagnostic problem. The mean follow-up was 9 years, (range 2 to 23) and the mean age was 10. 8 years at diagnosis. All complained of pain with no neurological deficit. The lesions were located on the vertebral bodies of C 4, T 9, T 10, L 1, L 2, and L 5, respectively. Histologic confirmation of diagnosis was obtained in all patients, two by puncture and four by open biopsy. The patients with <b>vertebra</b> <b>plana</b> (T 10, L 1, and L 5, respectively) were treated conservatively. Long-term follow-up demonstrated total healing of the vertebral body in two and partial rebuilding 8 years after diagnosis in one.

30|$|The typical {{radiographic}} {{appearance of}} eosinophilic granuloma of the extremities is a punched-out lytic-bone lesion without reactive sclerosis. In most cases, a hypervascularized soft-tissue mass surrounds the affected bone [26, 27]. The radiographic differential diagnosis should include plasmacytoma, multiple myeloma, osteochondritis, tuberculosis or osteomyelitis. In the spine, imaging studies may reveal variable vertebral involvement, ranging from isolated lytic lesions {{to a more}} significant vertebral collapse that involves the pedicles and posterior vertebral elements (<b>vertebra</b> <b>plana),</b> peridural spread and paraspinal soft tissue components [20, 25]. Although eosinophilic granuloma {{is the most common}} cause of <b>vertebra</b> <b>plana,</b> this finding can also be found in Ewing’s sarcoma, lymphoma and other sarcomas, infections such as tuberculosis, and osteogenesis imperfect [28, 29]. In favor of the eosinophilic granuloma are the isolated spinal disease, the lack of constitutional symptoms, and minimal laboratory abnormalities [28]. Cervical spine eosinophilic granuloma more often manifests with osteolytic lesions, rather than <b>vertebra</b> <b>plana</b> [18, 20, 25, 30].|$|E
40|$|Five {{patients}} with <b>vertebra</b> <b>plana</b> were followed for twelve to {{thirty years after}} the diagnosis had been made. Histiocytosis X had been the presumptive diagnosis in all five patients. Their ages at diagnosis ranged from four to twelve years and at follow-up, from nineteen to forty years. When they were last seen, none of the patients complained of symptoms related to the original disease, and the radiographs showed reconstitution of the vertebral height equivalent to 48 to 95 per cent of normal, {{with no sign of}} osteoarthritis. The best radiographic results occurred in the two youngest patients, who had involvement of the first lumbar vertebra, whereas the patient who was oldest at follow-up, with <b>vertebra</b> <b>plana</b> in the ninth thoracic vertebra, had the worst result. The four {{patients with}} just <b>vertebra</b> <b>plana</b> were treated with a plaster jacket and a brace, whereas the one with multicentric skeletal involvement had chemotherapy as well as orthopaedic treatment...|$|E
30|$|Osteodestructive lesions include osteolytic {{vertebral}} lesions, usually {{limited to}} one vertebrae, with a variable degree of collapse. Collapse may induce kyphosis, spinal canal stenosis, and spinal cord injury. If it is quite marked, it can present as a <b>vertebra</b> <b>plana</b> in children, which is not characteristic of an adult population [14]. Sacroiliitis can be seen and it is usually unilateral. Ankylosis may be present as well, and it is usually connected with the relief of pain [7, 38, 48].|$|E
40|$|Eosinophilic {{granuloma}} is {{a condition}} typically found in children and is characterized on plain radiographs {{by the appearance of}} <b>vertebra</b> <b>plana.</b> There have been several cases of eosinophilic granuloma, however, reported in adults should therefore be included in the differential diagnosis of a destructive vertebral lesion in any age group.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Initial {{presentation}} {{with primary}} spinal involvement in chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis of childhood (CRMO) is rare. Our {{objective was to}} review the imaging appearances of three patients who had CRMO who initially presented with isolated primary spinal involvement. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: The imaging, clinical, laboratory and histology findings of the three patients were retrospectively reviewed. Imaging included seven spinal MR imaging scans, one computed tomography scan, nine bone scans, two tomograms and 16 radiographs. These were reviewed by two musculoskeletal radiologists and a consensus view is reported. All three patients presented with atraumatic spinal pain and had extensive bone spinal pathology. The patients were aged 11, 13 and 12 years. There were two females and one male. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The initial patient had thoracic T 6 and T 8 <b>vertebra</b> <b>plana.</b> Bone scan showed additional vertebral body involvement. Follow-up was available over a 3 year period. The second patient had partial collapse of T 9 and, 2 years later, of C 6. Subsequently extensive multifocal disease ensued and follow-up was available over 8 years. The third patient initially had L 3 inferior partial collapse and 1 year later T 8 involvement with multifocal disease. Follow-up was available over 3 years. The imaging findings of the three patients include partial and complete <b>vertebra</b> <b>plana</b> with a subchondral line adjacent to endplates associated with bone marrow MR signal alterations. Awareness of the imaging appearances may help the radiologist to include this entity in the differential diagnosis in children who present with spinal pathology and no history of trauma. Histopathological examination excludes tumor and infection but with typical imaging findings {{may not always be}} necessar...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the clinical and imaging outcome {{of patients with}} symptomatic eosinophilic granuloma of the spine treated with CT-guided intralesional methylprednisolone injection after biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 19) with symptomatic solitary eosinophilic granuloma of the spine treated by CT-guided intralesional methylprednisolone injection were retrospectively studied. There were 12 males and seven females {{with a mean age}} of 17 years (range, 3 - 43 years). The mean follow-up was 6 years (median, 4 years; range, 0. 5 - 19 years). Spinal location included the cervical (two patients), thoracic (seven patients), lumbar spine (eight patients), and the sacrum (two patients). <b>Vertebra</b> <b>plana</b> was observed in two patients. All patients had biopsies before treatment. RESULTS: Complete resolution of pain and healing of the lesion was observed in 17 patients (89. 5...|$|E
40|$|Percutaneous vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplas-ty {{are less}} {{invasive}} treatment options than open surgery {{for patients with}} vertebral compression frac-tures. With balloon kyphoplasty, the injection of bone cement is preceded by inflation and removal of bone tamps (balloons) inside the fractured vertebral body. This allows {{for the creation of}} a void, where viscous cement is delivered resulting in a lower risk for cement leakage than with vertebroplasty. Another advantage of the balloon inflation is the potential to correct the deformity and restore sagittal alignment. The percutaneous techniques normally require intact pedicles and intact posterior elements. We found that modifying the technique made it suit-able for the management of <b>vertebra</b> <b>plana,</b> traumat-ic fractures, and neoplasms. Our study documents the different modified techniques and the clinical results obtained within the first 21 patients...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 9 -year-old girl who had complained of {{mid-back}} pain for two months. The plain X ray of the thoracic spine revealed <b>vertebra</b> <b>plana</b> (collapse of the vertebral body), and magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine showed that the T- 7 vertebral body had collapsed, and there was slight compression of the spinal cord. The patient underwent a fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous transpedicular biopsy and the histology led to a diagnosis of Langerhans ’ cell histiocytosis. After low-dose radiotherapy and six months immobilized in a spinal brace, the mid-back pain subsided but the plain X ray of the thoracic spine revealed collapse of the vertebral body. Therefore, we report it as a rare case and discuss the clinical significance of this disorder. Key words: Langerhans ’ cell histiocytosis, percutaneously transpedicular biopsy, vertebra plan...|$|E
40|$|Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH) {{represents a}} disorder characterised by an abnormal accumulation of histiocytes in miscellaneous tissues. The bone is commonly affected, especially the flat bones, the spine {{and the long}} bones. Some lesions in children such as a “vertebra plana ” or a solitary lytic lesion of the skull may be suggestive for LCH, whereas others can be confused with a malignant tumour or osteomy-elitis. This pictorial essay presents the main usual and un-usual skeletal manifestations observed in LCH. Teaching points • Osseous involvement in children with LCH {{is very similar to}} that seen in multiple myeloma. • A solitary lytic lesion of the cranial vault is a typical radiographic finding of LCH. • A <b>vertebra</b> <b>plana</b> appearance in the spine is another typical radiographic finding. • Extensive signal intensity changes within bone marrow on MRI are a helpful sign for the diagnosis. • In long bones, endosteal scalloping may be responsible for a “budding appearance”...|$|E
40|$|A case of polyostotic eosinophilic {{granuloma}} of the lumbar spine in a seven year old male is reported. CT guided biopsy was not diagnostic on two occasions. Diagnosis was made clinically and radiographically {{with evidence of}} L 3 <b>vertebra</b> <b>plana</b> and lytiylesion at L 5. The patient was treated conservatively with aTLSO brace for spinal immobilization. Fifteen months after diagnosis, the patient is alive and well. Lesions at L 3 and L 5 persist with no progression of disease. The patient has resumed full physical activity and is being followed every six months with serial imagery. Eosinophilic granuloma {{is the most common}} and benign form of the three clinical entities comprising Langerhans cell histiocytosis:. It affects all ages but predominantly children and young adults. Back pain that persists after conservative therapy including anti-inflammatories and physical therapy warrants radiologic evaluation. Lesions found on plain films can be further evaluated with MR imaging. Bone scans are useful in finding additional bony or visceral lesions. A number of treatments have been suggested in the management of EG, however nearly all research suggests a conservative approach is most prudent for single system bony disease in patients free of neurologic deficit...|$|E
