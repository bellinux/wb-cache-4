40|$|Young onset Alzheimer’s disease (YOAD) {{is defined}} as symptom onset {{before the age of}} 65 [*]years and is {{particularly}} associated with phenotypic heterogeneity. Atypical presentations, such as the clinic-radiological <b>visual</b> <b>syndrome</b> posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), often lead to delays in accurate diagnosis. Eyetracking has been used to demonstrate basic oculomotor impairments in individuals with dementia. In the present study, we aim to explore the relationship between eyetracking metrics and standard tests of visual cognition in individuals with YOAD. Fifty-seven participants were included: 36 individuals with YOAD (n[*]=[*] 26 typical AD; n[*]=[*] 10 PCA) and 21 age-matched healthy controls. Participants completed three eyetracking experiments: fixation, pro-saccade, and smooth pursuit tasks. Summary metrics were used as outcome measures and their predictive value explored looking at correlations with visuoperceptual and visuospatial metrics. Significant correlations between eyetracking metrics and standard visual cognitive estimates are reported. A machine-learning approach using a classification method based on the smooth pursuit raw eyetracking data discriminates with approximately 95 % accuracy patients and controls in cross-validation tests. Results suggest that the eyetracking paradigms of a relatively simple and specific nature provide measures not only reflecting basic oculomotor characteristics but also predicting higher order visuospatial and visuoperceptual impairments. Eyetracking measures can represent extremely useful markers during the diagnostic phase and may be exploited as potential outcome measures for clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} work conditions, to estimate the prevalence and to describe risk factors associated with Computer Vision Syndrome among two call centers' operators in Sao Paulo (n = 476). The methods include a quantitative cross-sectional observational study and an ergonomic work analysis, using work observation, interviews and questionnaires. The case definition was the presence of one or more specific ocular symptoms answered as always, often or sometimes. The multiple logistic regression model, were created using the stepwise forward likelihood method and remained the variables with levels below 5 % (p < 0. 05). The operators were mainly female and young (from 15 to 24 years old). The call center was opened 24 hours and the operators weekly hours were 36 hours with break time from 21 to 35 minutes per day. The symptoms reported were eye fatigue (73. 9 %), "weight" in the eyes (68. 2 %), "burning" eyes (54. 6 %), tearing (43. 9 %) and weakening of vision (43. 5 %). The prevalence of Computer Vision Syndrome was 54. 6 %. Associations verified were: being female (OR 2. 6, 95 % CI 1. 6 to 4. 1), lack of recognition at work (OR 1. 4, 95 % CI 1. 1 to 1. 8), organization of work in call center (OR 1. 4, 95 % CI 1. 1 to 1. 7) and high demand at work (OR 1. 1, 95 % CI 1. 0 to 1. 3).

Concerning bisection line authors find different spatial-location biases in relation to segment length, line spatial localisation and its visual availability (solid line vs unfilled gap).

Material and method Participants: three post-acute right-brain damaged patients with left neglect and no other problem such as dementia, psychiatric disorders and global attentional deficit or general illness which could prevent to undergo to computerized experimental sessions; and 10 control subject matched for age and education. Participants were asked to indicate midpoint in an unfilled gap between to endpoints. All item varied in length and spatial position. Result Main analysis were conducted on bisection performance, RTs and eye movements with two factor repeated-measure ANOVAs (group*segment length and group*spatial location). We found main effect of group and significant interaction effects. Patients show higher rightwards fixation movements (F(1, 11) = 7. 78, p<. 001) and fixation duration (F(1, 11) = 12. 45, p<. 001). Further statistical analysis showed worst performance and reduction of leftwards eye-movents only for extremely left stimuli.

40|$|Cancer {{may affect}} the eye and orbit {{as a direct result}} of metastatic {{neoplastic}} infiltration, compression, or circulating antibodies involving paraneoplastic retinal degeneration, A metastatic tumor to the uvea is the most common form of an intraocular metastatic process. The choroid is the most common site for uveal metastasis; metastases to the ciliary body, iris, retina, optic diskc, and vitreous are rare. Approximately one-third of patients have no history of primary cancer at the time of ocular diagnosis. Breast and lung carcinomas for women and lung and gastrointestinal carcinomas for men most commonly metastasize to the eye and orbit. The short-term prognosis for vision is usually good after an individualized therapeutic approach (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, external beam radiotherapy, or plaque radiotherapy), but the systemic prognosis is poor, The <b>visual</b> paraneoplastic <b>syndromes</b> encompass several distinct clinical and pathological entities including carcinoma-associated retinopathy (CAR), melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR), and bilateral diffuse melanocytic uveal proliferation (BDUMP).

Identification of circulating antidodies against retinal proteins (recoverin, 23 -kDa retinal protein; 46 -kDa and 60 -kDa retinal proteins) serves to recognize the paraneoplastic nature of the patient's symptoms, which frequently develop before the cancer is diagnosed.

40|$|<b>Visual</b> snow <b>syndrome</b> is a {{persistent}} visual disturbance characterized by rapid flickering dots {{in the entire}} visual field. Hypothesized to arise from reduced inhibition of sensory cortex, visual snow has recently been linked to potentiation (enhancement) of the P 100, an event-related potential (ERP) component associated with early visual processing. Here, we investigate whether this potentiation in visual snow is specific to visual responses, by comparing ERPs linked to early, bottom-up perceptual versus late, top-down cognitive processes. Specifically, we examined two components, the N 170 and P 300, associated respectively with rapid face categorization and attentional orienting towards targets. We predicted that if visual snow predominantly reflects diminished inhibition of perceptual areas, there should be stronger potentiation for the earlier perceptual N 170 component. ERPs associated with the N 170 (Face 3 ̆e House) and P 300 (Target 3 ̆e Nontarget) were recorded in a 22 year-old male with a 2 -year history of visual snow symptoms {{and a set of}} age- and gender-matched controls. Although N 170 and P 300 responses in all participants showed appropriate face- and target-selectivity, respectively, the visual snow patient demonstrated consistent potentiation relative to controls, particularly for the early N 170 response. Bootstrapped estimates of mean amplitude computed within participants similarly revealed larger and more variable ERP amplitudes in the visual snow patient, especially for the N 170 component. These results support an early perceptual locus of ERP potentiation in visual snow, further supporting the idea that this condition arises from diminished inhibition of sensory cortices...|$|R
