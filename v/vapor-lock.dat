5000|$|In {{commercial}} and industrial, unenclosed NM cable is often prohibited {{in certain areas}} or altogether (depending on what the building is used for and local/state building codes). Therefore, it is almost never used by commercial electrical contractors. Most wiring is put in non-flexible conduit, usually EMT because of its cost and durability. Rigid may be required for certain areas and additionally, <b>vapor-lock</b> fittings may be required in areas where a fire or explosion hazard is present (such as gas stations, chemical factories, grain silos, etc.) PVC can be used where wire is run underground or where concrete will be poured. A duct bank is usually made of multiple PVC conduits encased in concrete. FMC or Flex is used where EMT or other non-flexible conduit is impractical or for short runs, known as [...] "whips", to lights or other devices. For power circuits, the color-coding uses the same colors as residential construction, and adds the additional wires used for three-phase systems. Black, Red and Blue are used for hot wires and White is used as the neutral wire in a 120/208 V circuit. Brown, Orange and Yellow are used as hot wires and gray is used as the neutral wire in a 277/480 V. For grounding, regardless of the voltage, Green is used.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} Aluminum-oxide brake nanofluids (AOBN) manufactured by a home-made machine, the plasma arc system. The plasma electric arc welding machine was specially modified to be a nanofluid production system in the experiment. Argon was chosen to be the plasma gas {{because it can be}} ionized very easily and needs only lower voltage to keep the production of plasma electric arcs continuous. The aluminum bulk specimen is then mixed with DOT 3 break fluid. The AOBN thus obtained shows a higher boiling, higher viscosity and higher conductivity. Furthermore, they are affected by the synthesizing parameters such as cooling liquid temperature and vacuum pressure. The confirmed appearance of nanoparticles was determined by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and X-RAY. This study revealed that a home made plasma arc machine can produce AOBN which surpasses the boiling point to reduce the occurrence of <b>vapor-lock,</b> higher viscosity, higher conductivity and circle geometry common to the superior performance of brake nanofluids...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{dynamics}} of confined water in capillaries and nanotubes suggests that gating of ion channels may involve not only {{changes of the}} pore geometry, but also transitions between water-filled and empty states in certain locations. The recently solved heptameric structure of the small mechanosensitive channel of Escherichia coli, MscS, has revealed a relatively wide (7 – 15 Å) yet highly hydrophobic transmembrane pore. Continuum estimations based on the properties of pore surface suggest low conductance and a thermodynamic possibility of dewetting. To test the predictions we performed molecular dynamics simulations of MscS filled with flexible TIP 3 P water. Irrespective to the initial conditions, several independent 6 -ns simulations converged to the same stable state with the pore water-filled in the wider part, but predominantly empty in the narrow hydrophobic part, displaying intermittent vapor-liquid transitions. The polar gain-of-function substitution L 109 S in the constriction resulted in a stable hydration of the entire pore. Steered passages of Cl− ions through the narrow part of the pore consistently produced partial ion dehydration and required a force of 200 – 400 pN to overcome an estimated barrier of 10 – 20 kcal/mole, implying negligibly low conductance. We conclude that the crystal structure of MscS does not represent an open state. We infer that MscS gate, {{which is similar to}} that of the nicotinic ACh receptor, involves a <b>vapor-lock</b> mechanism where limited changes of geometry or surface polarity can locally switch the regime between water-filled (conducting) and empty (nonconducting) states...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} gating {{events with}} a time-base many orders-of-magnitude slower {{than that of}} atomic motion in voltage-gated ion channels such as the Shaker-type KV channels, a multiscale physical model is constructed from the experimentally well-characterized voltage-sensor (VS) domains coupled to a hydrophobic gate. The four VS domains are described by a continuum electrostatic model under voltage-clamp conditions, the control of ion flow by the gate domain is described by a <b>vapor-lock</b> mechanism, and the simple coupling principle is informed by known experimental results and trial-and-error. The configurational energy computed for each element is used to produce a total Hamiltonian that {{is a function of}} applied voltage, VS positions, and gate radius. We compute statistical-mechanical expectation values of macroscopic laboratory observables. This approach stands in contrast with molecular-dynamic models which are challenged by increasing scale, and kinetic models which assume a probability distribution rather than derive it from the underlying physics. This generic model predicts well the Shaker charge/voltage and conductance/voltage relations; the tight constraints underlying these results allow us to quantitatively assess the underlying physical mechanisms. The total electrical work picked up by the VS domains is an order-of-magnitude larger than the work required to actuate the gate itself, suggesting an energetic basis for the evolutionary flexibility of the voltage-gating mechanism. The cooperative slide-and-interlock behavior of the VS domains described by the VS-gate coupling relation leads to the experimentally observed bistable gating. This engineering approach should prove useful in the investigation of various elements underlying gating characteristics and degraded behavior due to mutation...|$|E
