25|$|Subversion {{also uses}} {{properties}} on revisions themselves. Like the above properties on filesystem entries {{the names are}} completely arbitrary, with the Subversion client using certain properties prefixed with 'svn:'.

25|$|One {{important}} feature of the Subversion filesystem is properties: simple name=value pairs of text. Properties occur on filesystem entries (i.e., files and directories). These are <b>versioned</b> just like other changes to the filesystem. Users can add any property they wish, and the Subversion client uses a set of properties, which it prefixes with 'svn:'.|$|E
