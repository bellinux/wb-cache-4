40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the evolutions of {{the different}} needs related to the food and non food uses of conventional oil crops (palm, cotton, groundnuts), immerging and marketable oil culture (shea) {{as well as the}} domestic oil cultures (Canarium, safou). Africa accounts for about 6. 5 % of the total World production of palm oil. In the last few years palm oil has witnessed an evolution in Africa through the diversification of its uses. A lot has also been done on the use of palm oil as bio-fuels. The production of cotton seed oil has equally witnessed changes from press extraction followed by solvent extraction to direct extraction with pure solvents followed by neutralisation in an appropriate medium as major innovations. West Africa produces about 50 % of the total groundnuts production in Africa. Small scale processing of groundnuts is more popular than industrial processing. This is justified by the diverse uses {{of the different}} groundnut byproducts. The most remarkable innovations concern the emerging oil cultures such as shea butter. In fact the incorporation of 5 % shea butter in chocolate formulations has given an added value to shea. Techniques have been put in place for improving on the production methods and quality of the butter. The evolution in this sector is better illustrated by the putting in place of an indirect solar dryer and a <b>vertical</b> manual <b>screw</b> <b>press.</b> The big handicap that slows down evolution remains {{at the level of the}} transfer of technology to the rural milieu. Problems on the transfer preservation of Canarium were resolved by preserving them in appropriate media and conditions. Dried safou fruits can now be found in the market. This illustrates the appropriation of technology by small and medium sized enterprises...|$|R

The stable helical vortex in TCP flow is beneficial to improve the transporting efficiency of granular materials. This paper described the N-S equations of incompressible steady flow (air) in <b>vertical</b> <b>screw</b> conveyor and deduced the distribution solution of velocity of stable helical vortex in TCP. And this paper also analyzed the relationship between the Reynolds number Re and parameters such as rotational speed of screw shaft, shaft diameter of screw shaft, screw pitch.

The effect of simulation verified the correctness of theoretical analysis and recommended the critical Reynolds number Rec suitable for appearance of stable helical vortex in TCP flow in the conveyor.

The problems associated with the single screw expeller is that, it requires three or more passes to expel oil from seeds, which increases the production time and are also less efficient. In this paper, a counter rotating twin screw expeller is designed for extraction of oil from the Pongamia pinnata seeds.

The study was considered as a 4 × 3 × 3 factorial experiment with four levels of heating temperatures (80, 90, 100 and 110 0 C), three levels of moisture content (7, 8,and 9 %wb) and in three replications using a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with moisture content as a blocking factor. The results of the evaluation shows that extraction efficiency increases with increase in temperature but tends to decrease as the temperature increased beyond 100 0 C in both samples.
