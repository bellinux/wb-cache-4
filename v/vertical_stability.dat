40|$|During the Phoenix Sunrise Experiment in June-July, 2001, the {{vertical}} distributions of NO 2, HONO, NO 3 {{and several other}} trace gases were measured with a long-path {{differential optical absorption spectroscopy}} system in the downtown area. Strong vertical gradients of all observed species were observed during the night, clearly showing that nocturnal chemistry in this urban environment is height dependent. The disappearance of the gradients in the morning shows the onset of vertical mixing during the transition of a stable boundary layer to a well-mixed layer. During very stable nights, when NO and VOCs emissions were trapped near the ground, mixing ratios of NO 3 up to 200 ppt were found at 110 - 140 m above the ground. Using this information together with the measurements of NO 2, vertical profiles of N 2 O 5 can be derived. In addition, {{the vertical}} distribution of HONO and NO 2 allows the investigation of heterogeneous HONO formation process on surfaces and the impact of relative humidity on this process. Clear gradients of HCHO were also observed during most nights with high <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilities,</b> suggesting important direct sources of HCHO.

40|$|International audienceOn 28 ? 29 November 2005 an extratropical storm {{affected}} the Canary Islands causing significant damage related to high average wind speeds and intense gusts over some {{islands of the}} archipelago. Delta was the twenty-sixth tropical or subtropical storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.

Variations in <b>vertical</b> static <b>stability,</b> <b>vertical</b> windshear and the intense synoptic winds of the southwestern part of Delta with a warm core at 850 hPa were the main characteristics that contributed to the development and amplification of intense gravity waves while the large-scale flow interacted with the complex topography of the islands...|$|R

5000|$|The {{essence of}} the model is that air rising from the surface at the equator conserves its angular {{momentum}} as it moves poleward. This distribution of wind, in turn, determines the distribution of temperature, which determines the latitudinal extent of the circulation by requiring energy conservation.

The Hadley circulation has a cooling effect at and near the equator and a warming effect at higher latitudes within the Hadley Cell.

40|$|Abstract. We {{compare the}} {{equilibrium}} climate responses of a quasi-dynamical energy balance model to radiative forcing by equivalent changes in CO 2, solar total irradiance (Stot) and solar UV (SUV). The response is {{largest in the}} SUV case, in which the imposed UV radiative forcing is preferentially absorbed in the layer above 250 mb, {{in contrast to the}} weak response from global-columnar radiative loading by increases in CO 2 or Stot. The hypersensitive response of the climate system to solar UV forcing is caused by strongly coupled feedback involving <b>vertical</b> static <b>stability,</b> tropical thick cirrus ice clouds and stratospheric ozone.

In the upper mixed layer (UML), identified through the <b>vertical</b> <b>stability</b> E(Z(UML)), nutrient consumption is calculated as {{the difference between the}} Â« diluted Â» nutrient value and the mean calculated from the integrated value in the UML. The nutrient utilisation ratio and E(Z(UML)) are linearly related for E(Z(UML)) 25, the distribution pattern is more scattered and independent of E(Z(UML)). For E(Z(UML)) > 25, utilisation values were > 4, 0. 4 and 10 mmol m- 3 for nitrate, phosphate and silicate, respectively. Significant relationships between nutrient depletion and both particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate protein / particulate carbohydrate ratios (PPRT/PCHO) are found. The analysis of particulate matter distribution vs nutrient utilisation shows that the stations could be divided into two groups having different characteristics. The first group includes coastal stations, where high nutrient utilisation, POC and PPRT / PCHO are typical of areas with high production. In the second group (pelagic stations), nutrient utilisation, POC and PPRT / PCHO are lower.
