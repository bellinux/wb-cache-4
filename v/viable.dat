5|$|Lithium {{is present}} in seawater, but commercially <b>viable</b> methods of {{extraction}} {{have yet to be}} developed.|$|E
5|$|Seed {{germination}} {{rates are}} quite high. One study found germination rates better than 77% in most batches tested. Seed {{is likely to}} remain <b>viable</b> for a long time, as seed of the closely related B.cuneata remains <b>viable</b> for around ten years.|$|E
5|$|After 1978, {{a number}} of astronomers kept up the search for Lowell's PlanetX, {{convinced}} that, because Pluto {{was no longer a}} <b>viable</b> candidate, an unseen tenth planet must have been perturbing the outer planets.|$|E
5|$|Any firearm {{collected}} {{during the course of}} an investigation could yield <b>viable</b> evidence if examined. For forensic firearm examination specific evidence that can be recovered include weapon serial numbers and potentially fingerprints left on the weapon's surface.|$|E
5|$|As an {{alloying}} agent with magnesium to create high-strength metals {{that are used}} in aircraft engines; yttrium and neodymium are also <b>viable</b> substitutes.|$|E
5|$|As of December 2013, in {{anticipation}} of the rescheduling of alprazolam to Schedule 8 in Australiaâ€”Pfizer Australia announced they would be discontinuing the Xanax brand in Australia as it is no longer commercially <b>viable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fans {{were excited}} by the character's reveal, and {{professional}} players praised the balance of his move set. Other critics considered Doomfist too vulnerable to be <b>viable,</b> and insufficiently exciting to rekindle the interest of old players.|$|E
5|$|If a <b>viable</b> {{hybrid embryo}} is {{obtained}} via gene editing procedures, {{it may be}} possible to implant it into a female Asian elephant housed in a zoo, but with the current knowledge and technology, it is unknown if the hybrid embryo would be carried through the two-year gestation.|$|E
5|$|In June 2017, a new {{subsidiary}} named Lothian Country commenced {{operating service}} 43 to South Queensferry after the previous operator Stagecoach East Scotland deemed the service not economically <b>viable.</b>|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, Cala Homes sought {{permission}} from the London Borough of Hillingdon to sell the first 30 completed homes before completing all highway work on the site {{in order to keep}} the development financially <b>viable.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} a GIS {{study published}} in 2014 documented that for many rural areas {{the time needed to}} drive to water testing labs than is longer than the sample is <b>viable.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, for example, the Carbon Trust {{recently}} {{estimated the}} extent of the economically <b>viable</b> offshore resource at 55 TWh per year, about 14% of current national demand. Across Europe, the technologically achievable resource has been estimated to be at least 280 TWh per year. In 2003, the U.S. Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimated the <b>viable</b> resource in the United States at 255 TWh per year (6% of demand).|$|E
5|$|In {{the past}} century {{agriculture}} has been characterized by increased productivity, the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor, water pollution, and farm subsidies. Other applications of scientific research since 1950 in agriculture include gene manipulation, hydroponics, {{and the development of}} economically <b>viable</b> biofuels such as ethanol.|$|E
5|$|Interspecific hybrids are bred by mating {{individuals}} from two species, normally {{from within the}} same genus. The offspring display traits and characteristics of both parents, but are often sterile, preventing gene flow between the species. Sterility is often attributed to the different number of chromosomes between the two species. For example, donkeys have 62 chromosomes, horses have 64 chromosomes, and mules or hinnies have 63 chromosomes. Mules, hinnies, and other normally sterile interspecific hybrids cannot produce <b>viable</b> gametes, because differences in chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during meiosis, meiosis is disrupted, and <b>viable</b> sperm and eggs are not formed. However, fertility in female mules has been reported with a donkey as the father.|$|E
5|$|Manganese has no {{satisfactory}} substitute in {{its major}} applications in metallurgy. In minor applications, (e.g., manganese phosphating), zinc and sometimes vanadium are <b>viable</b> substitutes.|$|E
5|$|On February 7, 2008, Huckabee made {{a trip to}} New York to make {{yet another}} {{appearance}} on The Colbert Report, declaring {{he was still a}} <b>viable</b> candidate in the race. By the end of the segment, he was playing a game of air hockey with the host.|$|E
5|$|Plant species often {{hybridize}} {{more readily}} than animal species, and the resulting hybrids are fertile more often. Many plant species {{are the result of}} hybridization, combined with polyploidy, which duplicates the chromosomes. Chromosome duplication allows orderly meiosis and so <b>viable</b> seed can be produced.|$|E
5|$|Renormalizability {{has become}} an {{essential}} criterion for a quantum field theory to {{be considered as a}} <b>viable</b> one. All the theories describing fundamental interactions, except gravitation whose quantum counterpart is presently under very active research, are renormalizable theories.|$|E
5|$|TPWD, {{acting on}} {{the report of the}} ship's condition, and on the report of the {{engineering}} <b>viable</b> dry berth alternatives, and on their internal studies and reports, prepared a progress report which they presented to the Legislative Budget Board (LBB) in late July 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Colias eurytheme and C. philodice {{butterflies}} {{have retained}} enough genetic compatibility to produce <b>viable</b> hybrid offspring. Hybrid speciation may have produced the diverse Heliconius butterflies, {{but that is}} disputed.|$|E
5|$|The airline {{announced}} {{intentions to}} commence flights to Guangzhou and Kunming in China in summer 2014. Former Biman board director Kazi Oahedul Alam criticised the expansion as poorly planned and not commercially <b>viable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The pitch {{invasion}} at the 1924 Paris Olympics {{had given}} rugby a poor image and this, {{together with the}} problems of attracting sufficient teams to make it a <b>viable</b> sport and the desire to include more individual and women's events, spelled the death knell for rugby at the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} land-based subductive {{waste disposal}} method would dispose of nuclear waste in a subduction zone accessed from land, and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement. This method {{has been described}} as a <b>viable</b> means of disposing of radioactive waste, and as a state-of-the-art nuclear waste disposal technology.|$|E
5|$|The species Gryllus bimaculatus {{exhibits}} {{the reproductive}} pattern of polyandry. This sexual selective pattern increases the overall fitness {{of the species}} and promotes genetic variation. The females select and mate with multiple <b>viable</b> sperm donors and exhibit a distinct preference for novel mates.|$|E
5|$|The <b>viable</b> semen is then {{implanted}} in the ewe and the many lambs born through this process are proving to be normal and healthy. DNA tests have proved that up to 10% of the lambs are sired by the surrogate ram and carry the genetics of the donor ram.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of fan made games based on the series, {{inspired}} by what is often described as the <b>viable,</b> yet intriguing game mechanics Five Nights at Freddy's offers.|$|E
5|$|This {{resistance}} to extreme environments has made archaea {{the focus of}} speculation about the possible properties of extraterrestrial life. Some extremophile habitats are not dissimilar to those on Mars, leading to the suggestion that <b>viable</b> microbes could be transferred between planets in meteorites.|$|E
5|$|Today, most commercially <b>viable</b> diamond {{deposits}} are in Russia (mostly in Sakha Republic, {{for example}} Mir pipe and Udachnaya pipe), Botswana, Australia (Northern and Western Australia) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E
5|$|When {{only the}} outside is affected, the inner ivory is still commercially <b>viable.</b> As {{there are not}} yet {{verified}} techniques for identifying ivory that was previously burned, some have expressed concerns regarding the possible use {{of some of the}} burned stockpiles.|$|E
5|$|With La Haye Sainte captured, Ney {{then moved}} skirmishers and horse {{artillery}} up towards Wellington's centre. French artillery began to pulverise the infantry squares at short range with canister. The 30th and 73rd Regiments suffered such heavy losses {{that they had}} to combine to form a <b>viable</b> square.|$|E
5|$|Xenon {{has been}} used as a general anesthetic. Although it is expensive, {{anesthesia}} machines that can deliver xenon are expected to appear on the European market because advances in recovery and recycling of xenon have made it economically <b>viable.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Schultheiss, Herrmann, and Jonas, {{although}} Trousseau {{had earlier}} suggested that surgery was a <b>viable</b> option, {{there is no}} evidence that the subject subsequently received treatment; They suggest several possible factors, including legal issues, the subject's refusal, or failed treatment followed by a lack of reporting, for the lack of surgery or evidence of such. Maisonneuve, partially shown in one of the photographs, treated another intersex patient in 1862.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>viable</b> use {{of custom}} allocators is for {{debugging}} memory-related errors. This {{could be achieved}} by writing an allocator that allocates extra memory in which it places debugging information. Such an allocator {{could be used to}} ensure that memory is allocated and deallocated by the same type of allocator, and also provide limited protection against overruns.|$|E
5|$|Boosey & Hawkes' musical {{instruments}} division was gradually scaled {{down from the}} mid-1970s as it became less <b>viable</b> to have such an extensive range of products. Various lines were outsourced and sold off. By {{the time of the}} closure of the Edgware factory in 2001, brass instruments were the only thriving part of the instrument range. Production was moved to Watford, Hertfordshire, and the instruments rebranded Besson.|$|E
5|$|By 1882, Castle {{contained}} some 79 undergraduates out of 205 at {{the university}} as a whole. Despite the university largely failing to gain recognition and prestige, {{a number of other}} colleges had opened {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century. Of these, Cosin's Hall failed to become financially <b>viable</b> and was absorbed into University College in 1864. Enrolment numbers continued to fluctuate.|$|E
5|$|Chromium was {{discovered}} {{as an element}} after {{it came to the}} attention of the Western world in the red crystalline mineral crocoite (lead(II) chromate), discovered in 1761 and initially used as a pigment. Nearly all chromium is commercially extracted from the single commercially <b>viable</b> ore chromite, which is iron chromium oxide (FeCr2O4). Chromite is now the principal source of chromium for pigments.|$|E
