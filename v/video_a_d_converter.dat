After the theoretical analysis of the problem, an analytical/ numerical study is carried out on a mono-phase transformer, using a simple circuital model, which takes into account iron non linearity; two typical cases are considered, of a mono-phase transformer which feeds <b>a</b> <b>converter</b> (<b>d.</b> c. current is in secondary winding) and of a transformer fed by <b>a</b> <b>converter</b> (<b>d.</b> c. current in primary winding).

40|$|Abstract: Target {{modeling}} and model fitting {{are the two}} important parts {{of the problem of}} object tracking. The former has to provide a good reference for the latter. Online appearance models (OAM) has been successfully used for facial features tracking on account of their strong ability to adapt to variations, however, it suffers from time-consuming model fitting. Inverse Compositional Image Alignment (ICIA) algorithm has been proved to be an efficient, robust and accurate fitting algorithm. In this work, we introduce an efficient online appearance models based on ICIA, and apply it to track head pose and facial actions in <b>video.</b> <b>A</b> 3 <b>d</b> parameterized model, CANDIDE model, is used to model the face and facial expression, a weak perspective projection method is used to model the head pose, an adaptive appearance model is built on shape free texture, and then the efficient fitting algorithm is taken to track parameters of head pose and facial actions.

Restriction endonuclease si te polymorphism between clones Indicates {{that at least}} four phytochroroe genes are expressed In this tissue. Sequence analysis of two complete and one part ial coding region shows ~ 98 t horaoiogy at both the nucleotide and amino <b>a</b> <b>d</b> d leve ls, {{with the majority of}} amino <b>a</b> <b>d</b> d changes being conservative. High sequence homology Is also found In the 5 '-untranslated region but signif icant divergence occurs 1 n the 3 '-untranslated region. The phytochrome polypeptides are 1128 amino acid residues long corresponding to a molecular mass of 125 kdaltons. The known protein sequence at the chromophore attachment si te occurs only once 1 n the polypeptide, establishing that phytochrome has a single chromophore per monomer covalently linked to Cys- 321. Computer analyses of the amino <b>a</b> <b>d</b> d sequences have provided predictions regarding a number of structural features of the phytochrome molecule...|$|R
