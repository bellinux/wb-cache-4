5|$|One notable {{omission}} was {{the removal}} of the cutscene prior to the Psycho Mantis battle in which he reads the player's memory card and activates the vibration function of the player's controller if a DualShock is being used, as this scene involved the use of PlayStation-specific peripherals. The method for defeating Mantis was also changed from using the second controller to simply using the keyboard (regardless of whether the player was using a game controller or not up to that point). Other omissions include {{the removal of}} the eighth Codec frequency (140.07), which featured written commentaries by the developers, Meryl's alternate sneaking suit outfit, and the mission logs when loading a save file. However, the PC version adds the option to toggle moving and shooting in first-person <b>view</b> <b>mode</b> at any time regardless of difficulty setting, and players can now save their progress at any point without contacting Mei-Ling through the use of quick saves. On the VR training portion, all 300 missions, as well as the photoshoot mode, are available from the start, although the three unlockable preview trailers from the PlayStation version have been removed.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the game}} {{years after its}} release, IGN's Scott Thompson wrote that EarthBound {{balances}} [...] "dark Lovecraftian apocalypse and silly lightheartedness", and was just as interesting nearly a decade after its original release. While he lamented a lack of [...] "visual feedback" [...] in battle animations, he felt the game had innovations that still feel [...] "smart and unique": the rolling HP meter and lack of random battles. Thompson also noted that technical issues like animation slowdown with multiple enemies on-screen went unfixed in the rerelease. Official Nintendo Magazine Parkin found the game {{to provide a more}} potent experience than developers with more resources and thought its battle sequences were [...] "sleek". Nintendo World Report Justin Baker was surprised by the [...] "excellent" [...] battle system and controls, which he found to be underreported in other reviews despite their streamlined, grind-reducing convenience. He wrote that some of the menu interactions were clunky. GamesTM felt that the game was [...] "far from revolutionary", compared to Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, and that its battle scenes were unexciting. The magazine compared the game's [...] "chosen one" [...] story to a [...] "throwaway /Goonies hybrid narrative". Reviewers praised Nintendo for digitizing the Player's Guide, though IGN noted that it was technically easier to view it on another tablet rather than switching the Wii U's <b>view</b> <b>mode.</b> Multiple reviewers concluded that the game had aged well.|$|E

40|$|Keywords:stereo display,computer vision, visual comfort, <b>viewing</b> <b>modes,</b> depth Abstract. Stereo {{display is}} the {{important}} part in realizing the virtual reality. At present, the problem of visual comfort has restricted the development and application of the stereo display. The visual comfort is {{closely linked to the}} depth of the stereo images and the viewing conditions. We propose a method to evaluate and calculate the visual comfort based on the depth matching degree. First, we define the matching degree. Then, we establish the mathematics <b>viewing</b> <b>modes.</b> Finally we calculate the matching degree and estimate the visual comfort in different viewing distance and different <b>viewing</b> <b>modes</b> undertypical stereo display system. Experiments shows that the size of matching degree can well estimate the visual comfort and can help us decide the optimum viewing distance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{diagnostic}} performance of observers in detecting abnormalities in computer generated mammogram-like images. A mathematical {{model of the}} human breast is defined in which breast tissues are simulated by spheres of different sizes and densities. Images ar 2 ̆ 7 e generated by casting rays from a specified source, through the: model, and onto an image plane. Observer performance with two viewing modalities (stereo versus mono) is compared. In the stereo <b>viewing</b> <b>mode,</b> left and right images are presented to the observer (wearing liquid crystal shuttle glasses), such that the left eye sees the left image only and the right eye sees the right image only. In this way, the images can be fused by the observer to obtain a sense of depth. In the mono <b>viewing</b> <b>mode,</b> left and right images are presented side by side and the observer can see both images at the same time. Observer response data are evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to characterize any difference in detectability of abnormalities (in either the density or arrangement of simulated tissue densities) using the two <b>viewing</b> <b>modes.</b> The results indicate the clear superiority of stereo viewing for detection of arrangement abnormalities. For detection of density abnormalities, {{the performance of the}} two <b>viewing</b> <b>modes</b> is similar. These preliminary results suggest that stereomanlmography may permit easier detection of certain tissue abnormalities, perhaps providing a route to earlier tumor detection in cases of breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|One {{characteristic}} of natural visual behavior in humans is the frequent shifting of eye position. It {{has been argued}} that the characteristics of these eye movements can be used to distinguish between distinct modes of visual processing (Unema et al, 2005). These <b>viewing</b> <b>modes</b> would be distinguishable {{on the basis of the}} eye-movement parameters fixation duration and saccade amplitude and have been hypothesized to reflect the differential involvement of dorsal and ventral systems in saccade planning and information processing. According to this hypothesis, on the one hand, while in a pre-attentive or ambient mode, primarily scanning eye movements are made; in this mode fixation are relatively brief and saccades tends to be relatively large. On the other hand, in attentive focal mode, fixations last longer and saccades are relatively small, and result in viewing behaviour which could be described as detailed inspection. Thus far, no neuroscientific basis exists to support the idea that such distinct <b>viewing</b> <b>modes</b> are indeed linked to processing in distinct cortical regions. Here, we used fixation-based event-related (FIBER) fMRI in combination with independent component analysis (ICA) to investigate the neural correlates of these <b>viewing</b> <b>modes.</b> While we find robust eye-movement-related activations, our results do not support the theory that the above mentioned <b>viewing</b> <b>modes</b> modulate dorsal and ventral processing. Instead, further analyses revealed that eye-movement characteristics such as saccade amplitude and fixation duration did differentially modulate activity in three clusters in early, ventromedial and ventrolateral visual cortex. In summary, we conclude that evaluating viewing behaviour is crucial for unraveling cortical processing in natural vision...|$|R

50|$|The a550 {{stands out}} from other DSLR's in its price range with {{its use of}} 2 {{separate}} Live View modes. The first mode operates {{in the same way}} other DSLR's do, by switching from using the main sensor to using a secondary, smaller sensor. This allows the a550 to autofocus in its first Live <b>View</b> <b>mode.</b> However this only provides a 90% view of the final image the main sensor will take.The second Live <b>View</b> <b>mode</b> is named Manual Focus Check Live View. This mode uses the main 14.2 megapixel APS-C Type CMOS Exmor Sensor to provide a 100% view on the rear LCD. This mode does not allow auto focusing, hence the name Manual Focus Check Live View.When in Live <b>View</b> <b>mode</b> the a550 uses its 3.0 TFT Xtra Fine LCD, with 921,600 dots which can be adjusted to point downwards, for overhead shooting or upwards for below eye level shooting.
