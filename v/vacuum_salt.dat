50|$|Bulk {{shipments}} of salt from the Caribbean and Australia were landed at Mt Maunganui, where a <b>vacuum</b> <b>salt</b> plant was built. This produced the high-purity salt needed by {{producers in the}} dairy and pharmaceutical industries. A second, smaller vacuum plant was built at Grassmere.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, {{industrial}} mining and new drilling techniques made the discovery of more and deeper deposits possible, increasing mine salt's share of the market. Although mining salt was generally more expensive than extracting it from brine via solar evaporation of seawater, the introduction of this new source reduced the price of salt due to a reduction of monopolization. Extraction of salt from brine is still heavily used, for example, <b>vacuum</b> <b>salt</b> produced by British Salt in Middlewich has 57% of the UK market for salt used in cooking.|$|E

50|$|Initially {{she had a}} {{rectangular}} boiler, generating steam pressure at under 3 psi, and was fed by seawater. Boulton and Watt engines are not pressure engines, rather they are <b>vacuum</b> engines. (<b>Salt</b> water feed was common {{in the early days}} and could be done with low pressure and frequent boiler blowdowns to prevent salt scale build up on the plates.) The salt water played havoc with the boilers as the salinity rusted the wall thickness of the boiler, which would rot out. Beaver had to have a new boiler every seven years or so and went through multiple installations over her career. Over time the boiler pressure was increased, and 36 inch diameter cylinders replaced the original 42 inch cylinders.|$|R
40|$|Cod salting is a {{long process}} on which mass transfer, {{basically}} salt and water, occurs by diffusion. This work analyses and compares cod salting kinetics by using different salting techniques: brine salting, with and without applying a vacuum pulse and dry salting with and without pressure. The results revealed that mass transfer kinetics during cod salting process seemed {{to be affected by}} the salting method applied. Osmotic mechanism and diffusion transport of salt can be enhanced during <b>vacuum</b> pulsed brine <b>salting,</b> also leading to a lower water loss and higher yield. During dry salting, the coupling of osmotic mechanism and suctioning effect due to dry salt crystals (moreover in the case of pressured dry salting) favoured water losses and limited salt gain.

40|$|Between September 2009 and January 2011, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) and the Savannah River Site (SRS) HB-Line Facility designed, developed, tested, and {{successfully}} deployed a production-scale {{system for the}} distillation of sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium chloride (KCl) from plutonium oxide (PuO{sub 2 }). Subsequent efforts adapted the <b>vacuum</b> <b>salt</b> distillation (VSD) technology {{for the removal of}} chloride and fluoride from less-volatile halide salts at the same process temperature and vacuum. Calcium chloride (CaCl{sub 2 }), calcium fluoride (CaF{sub 2 }), and plutonium fluoride (PuF{sub 3 }) were of particular concern. To enable the use of the same operating conditions for the distillation process, SRNL employed in situ exchange reactions to convert the less-volatile halide salts to compounds that facilitated the distillation of halide without removal of plutonium. SRNL demonstrated the removal of halide from CaCl{sub 2 }, CaF{sub 2 } and PuF{sub 3 } below 1000 C using VSD technology...|$|E
40|$|In <b>vacuum</b> <b>salt</b> {{production}} sulfate is {{an important}} impurity, {{but it is also}} used to remove other cationic impurities from the raw brine. Removal of excess sulfate is currently done by purging salt crystallizer mother liquor from the brine plant, or crystallizing sodium sulfate through evaporative or cooling crystallization. The use of nanofiltration for the production of brines supersaturated in sodium sulfate is a technically feasible and attractive alternative. Crystallization of sodium sulfate in the membrane modules can be avoided by the presence of a primary nucleation inhibitor in the feed to the nanofiltration unit. Sodium sulfate crystallization can be induced in a separate crystallizer outside of the membrane unit by addition of crystal seeds. NF 270 is a suitable membrane for this application and is preferred over Desal DK, Desal DL, TS- 80 and MPF- 34. Chloride and bromide retentions are negative and they are a function of the difference in sulfate concentration between concentrate and permeate. Carbonate retentions are linearly dependent on sulfate retentions. Calcium retention for NF 270 is in excess of 95 % and proven to be stable during 1200 h of continuous on-site pilot plant operation. The same applies for the potassium retention albeit at a lower level of 10 %...|$|E

In 2011, SRNL adapted the technology {{for the removal of}} fluoride from fluoride-bearing salts. The method involved an in situ reaction between potassium hydroxide (KOH) and the fluoride salt to yield potassium fluoride (KF) and the corresponding oxide. The KF and excess KOH can be distilled below 1000 {deg}C using <b>vacuum</b> <b>salt</b> distillation (VSD). The apparatus for vacuum distillation contains a zone heated by a furnace and a zone actively cooled using either recirculated water or compressed air. During a vacuum distillation operation, a sample boat containing the feed material is placed into the apparatus while it is cool, and the system is sealed. The system is evacuated using a vacuum pump. Once a sufficient vacuum is attaned, heating begins. Volatile salts distill from the heated zone to the cooled zone where they condense, leaving behind the non-volatile material in the feed boat. Studies discussed in this report were performed involving the use of non-radioactive simulants in small-scale and pilot-scale systems as well as radioactive testing of a small-scale system with plutonium-bearing materials. Aspects of interest include removable liner design considerations, boat materials, in-line moisture absorption, and salt deposition...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{systematically}} {{analyzes the}} various {{factors that affect}} the current efficiency {{in the process of}} sponge titanium production by <b>vacuum</b> molten <b>salt</b> electrolysis method. The research result shows that firstly, when electrolysis is undertaken in CaCl 2 molten salt system under the condition that the pressure is under 101 Pa, temperature is at 850 ℃, space between electrodes is 5 cm, cathodic current density is 1. 05 A﹒cm- 2 and anodic current density is 0. 8 A﹒cm- 2, the reoxidation of sponge titanium can be effectively avoided, the loss of electric current can be reduced and current efficiency can be greatly improved. Secondly, current efficiency can be greatly improved when mix molten salt system CaCl 2 +A is adopted, which can greatly reduce the electrolysis temperature and the resistance of molten salt. Thirdly, current efficiency can be greatly improved through selecting appropriate vacuum degree, appropriate molten salt system, appropriate space between electrodes, appropriate current density; in addition, keeping tidy reduction cell inside and adopting high-purity molten salt and raw material TiO 2 are another ways for current efficiency improvement. Titanium keeps the advantage of steel and aluminum on the strength and weight aspects and high purity titanium can be widely used in every corner of our national economy for its good plasticity and corrosion resistanc...|$|R
40|$|Due to its {{combined}} {{properties of}} high electrical resistivity and high thermal conductivity aluminum nitride (AlN) {{is a highly}} desirable material for electronics applications. Methods are being sought for synthesis of unagglomerated, nanometer-sized powders of this material, prepared {{in such a way}} that they can be consolidated into solid compacts having minimal oxygen content. A procedure for synthesizing these powders through gas-phase combustion is described. This novel approach involves reacting AlCl 3, NH 3, and Na vapors. Equilibrium thermodynamic calculations show that 100 % yields can be obtained for these reactants with the products being AlN, NaCl, and H 2. The NaCl by-product is used to coat the AlN particles in situ. The coating allows for control of AlN agglomeration and protects the powders from hydrolysis during post-flame handling. On the basis of thermodynamic and kinetic considerations, two different approaches were employed to produce the powder, in co-flow diffusion flame configurations. In the first approach, the three reactants were supplied in separate streams. In the second, the AlCl 3 and NH 3 were premixed with HCl and then reacted with Na vapor. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of as-produced powders show only NaCl for the first case and NaCl and AlN for the second. After annealing at 775 C tinder dynamic <b>vacuum,</b> the <b>salt</b> was removed and XRD spectra of powders from both approaches show only AlN. Aluminum metal was also produced in the co-flow flame by reacting AlCl 3 with Na. XRD spectra of as-produced powders show the products to be only NaCl and elemental aluminum...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{recovery}} of actinides (An) from An-Al alloys formed by electrochemical separation of metallic {{spent nuclear fuel}} on solid aluminium electrodes in molten chloride salts is described. The proposed route consists of three main steps: <b>Vacuum</b> distillation of <b>salt</b> adhered on the electrodes, chlorination of An-Al alloy by pure chlorine gas and sublimation of formed AlCl 3. A thermochemical study of the route was performed to determine important chemical reactions and to find optimum experimental conditions for all process steps. Vacuum distillation of the electrode is efficient for complete removal of remaining salt and most fission products (FP), full chlorination of the An-Al alloys is possible at any working temperature and evaporation of AlCl 3 is achieved by heating under argon [...] Experiments {{have been carried out}} using U-Al alloy in order to define parameters providing full alloy chlorination without formation of volatile UCl 5 and UCl 6.

40|$|Vacuum {{distillation}} of chloride salts from {{plutonium oxide}} (PuO{sub 2 }) and simulant PuO{sub 2 } {{has been previously}} demonstrated at Department of Energy (DOE) sites using kilogram quantities of chloride salt. The apparatus for vacuum distillation contains a zone heated using a furnace and a zone actively cooled using either recirculated water or compressed air. During a vacuum distillation operation, a sample boat containing the feed material is placed into the apparatus while it is cool, and the system is sealed. The system is evacuated using a vacuum pump. Once a sufficient vacuum is attained, heating begins. Volatile salts distill from the heated zone to the cooled zone where they condense, leaving behind the non-volatile materials in the feed boat. The application of <b>vacuum</b> <b>salt</b> distillation (VSD) is {{of interest to the}} HB-Line Facility and the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Both facilities are involved in efforts to disposition excess fissile materials. Many of these materials contain chloride and fluoride salt concentrations which make them unsuitable for dissolution without prior removal of the chloride and fluoride salts. Between September 2009 and January 2011, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) and HB-Line designed, developed, tested, and successfully deployed a system for the distillation of chloride salts. Subsequent efforts are attempting to adapt the technology for the removal of fluoride. Fluoride salts of interest are less-volatile than the corresponding chloride salts. Consequently, an alternate approach is required for the removal of fluoride without significantly increasing the operating temperature. HB-Line Engineering requested SRNL to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of an alternate approach using both non-radioactive simulants and plutonium-bearing materials. Whereas the earlier developments targeted the removal of sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium chloride (KCl), the current activities are concerned with the removal of the halide ions associated with plutonium trifluoride (PuF{sub 3 }), plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF{sub 4 }), calcium fluoride (CaF{sub 2 }), and calcium chloride (CaCl{sub 2 }). This report discusses non-radioactive testing of small-scale and pilot-scale systems and radioactive testing of a small-scale system. Experiments focused on demonstrating the chemistry for halide removal and addressing the primary engineering questions associated with a change in the process chemistry...|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, salt is {{extracted}} from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. Traditionally, this was done in shallow open pans which were heated to increase the rate of evaporation. More recently, the process is performed in pans under <b>vacuum.</b> The raw <b>salt</b> is refined to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics. This usually involves recrystallization during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities (largely magnesium and calcium salts). Multiple stages of evaporation are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals, which are kiln-dried. Some salt is produced using the Alberger process, which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake. The Ayoreo, an indigenous group from the Paraguayan Chaco, obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree (Maytenus vitis-idaea) and other trees.|$|R
