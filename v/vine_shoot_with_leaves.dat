40|$|Summary To {{understand}} {{the development of}} crown struc-ture in Betula platyphylla Sukatch., mortality patterns of long shoots were analyzed quantitatively. We selected 25 saplings growing under various light conditions and measured the rela-tive photosynthetically active radiation (rPAR) at, and the three-dimensional position of, first-order branches. A long shoot was assigned “no buds ” (NB) status if it lacked buds {{at the end of}} the growing season, including at the tips of short shoots. A long shoot was classified as dead if it was NB and all the offspring long shoots issuing from it were NB. The proba-bility that a leafy long shoot (a current-year long <b>shoot</b> <b>with</b> <b>leaves</b> or an older long <b>shoot</b> <b>with</b> short <b>shoots</b> <b>with</b> <b>leaves)</b> would become NB by the end of the season was positively de-pendent on shoot age and branch age, and negatively dependent on shoot length, centripetal shoot order, branch height and rPAR at the branch. Randomization tests revealed that shoots became NB and dead in clusters of connected shoots. In partic-ular, shoot clusters originating from 3 -year-old shoots were more likely to die than expected if each shoot was assumed to become NB regardless of the connection. Stepwise logistic re-gression revealed that the maximum rPAR within the crown of an individual tree had a significant effect on the mortality rate of 3 -year-old <b>shoot</b> clusters, together <b>with</b> the rPAR at the level of the branch and other structural entities. Correlative inhibi-tion is an important mechanism for determining shoot mortal-ity patterns...|$|R

Crown height and stem diameter were positively correlated among clustered species, but not among solitary species or all species combined. Leaf dissection was correlated with crown height among the 17 species with dissected leaves; species <b>with</b> bifid <b>leaves</b> were significantly smaller than species <b>with</b> dissected <b>leaves</b> <b>with</b> respect to leaf size and stem diameter.

O experimento foi instalado em blocos ao acaso, com oito tratamentos: ramo em início de floração sem folha; ramo em início de floração com folha; ramo vegetativo sem folha; ramo vegetativo com folha; ramo com panícula seca sem folha; ramo com panícula seca com folha; ramo com flores abertas sem folha; ramo com flores abertas com folha; quatro repetições e de cinco a oito plantas por parcela. Utilizou-se um pomar de plantas de pé-franco, as quais foram decepadas e suas brotações enxertadas a pleno sol com propágulos do clone CCP 76. Avaliaram-se, na fase juvenil, o pegamento de enxertia, a altura da planta, a envergadura leste-oeste, e, na fase adulta, a produção: peso e número de castanha. A análise dos dados permitiu concluir que os melhores tratamentos, da fase juvenil, onde se verificou maior porcentagem de pegamento de enxertia (96 %), e as plantas que tiveram melhor desenvolvimento, foram os enxertados com propágulos de ramos com floração e flores abertas, independentemente de ter ou não folhas, seguidos dos em início de floração, nas mesmas condições.

40|$|Mature {{seeds of}} a pitcher plant (Nepenthes mirabilis (Lour.) Druce) were cultured in liquid and solid MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) {{supplemented}} with BA (6 -benzyladenine) at 1, 3 or 5 mg/l or withcoconut water (20 % v/v). The cultures were incubated under {{light and dark}} conditions. Seeds germinated only under light incubation and BA supplemented to both types of media, and solid medium with 3 mg/l BAresulted the highest seed germination (26 %) with good development of seedlings. On the contrary, the addition of coconut water to the basal medium produced poor seed germination and seedling growth. Moreover,all cultures in liquid medium terminated their growth after 6 weeks of culture. Young seedlings were subsequently transferred to fresh media of the same treatments after 15 weeks of seed culture. Multipleshoots were proliferated in all levels of BA after 6 weeks of transferring and more shoots were produced as BA level was increased. However, at high BA level of 5 mg/l, rosetting of shoots occurred while lowering BA level to 3 mg/l, fewer shoots were produced but they were vigorous, larger <b>shoots</b> <b>with</b> complete <b>leaves.</b> Rootdevelopment finally occurred in all BA treatments except the addition of coconut water. To evaluate the potential of shoot multiplication in different strengths of MS macromutrient, two types of explants, viz. shoot explants and stem explants (both approx. 1. 5 cm long) from in vitro seedlings,were cultured on full-strength MS macronutrient medium, 1 / 2 MS, 1 / 4 MS and 1 / 8 MS medium. Following 16 weeks of culture, shoot production (number/ explant) increased in both explant types as the macronutrientstrength decreased.
