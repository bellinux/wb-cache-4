For high data reliability, the control of <b>verify</b> levels in ISPP is important because the bit error rate (BER) will be affected significantly by <b>verify</b> levels. As M increases, the <b>verify</b> level control will be more important and complex. In this article, we investigate two <b>verify</b> level control criteria for MLC flash memories. The first criterion is to minimize the overall BER and the second criterion is to make page BERs equal. The choice between these criteria relates to flash memory architecture, bits per cell, reliability, and speed performance. Considering these factors, we will discuss the strategy of <b>verify</b> level control in the hybrid solid state drives (SSD) which are composed of flash memories with different number of bits per cell.|$|R
