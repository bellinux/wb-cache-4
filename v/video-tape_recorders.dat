40|$|THE LAST SIX YEARS {{have marked}} a trend to convert 16 mm films to video programs. The {{movement}} {{got its start}} {{with the introduction of}} efficient and moderately priced videotape recorders in the mid- 1960 s. The abun-dance of federal funds enabled many school districts to purchase <b>video-tape</b> <b>recorders</b> and film chains. (A film chain transmits the visual and sound images from a film to a video system. The images can be transmitted through a distribution network or they may be recorded on tape.) Al-though video equipment is more expensive than motion picture projectors, it is superior to projectors in terms of flexibility and ease of operation. Programs can be duplicated easily to meet peak demands. Video cassette machines are also easier to operate than projectors, making the materials more accessible to children and to adults who are intimidated by pro-jectors. Prerecorded videotapes are also much cheaper than 16 mm films (Time-Life Multimedia recently reduced the price of video cassettes to one-half the price of 16 mm films. Other firms can be expected to follow this trend.) Videotapes are much easier to maintain than films and they have a longer useful life. With all of these advantages, {{it is not surprising that}} libraries are buying video equipment and seeking licenses to duplicate films onto tape. Donald C. Hess was the pioneer promoter of purchasing licenses to duplicate films onto tape. 1 In August 1972, he began seeking information about licenses to copy films. Only 23 of the 127 firms he contacted re-sponded to his request for information. 2 Although many of the firms of-fered licenses for transmitting films over open- and closed-circuit educa...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Video-tape</b> <b>recorder</b> was {{introduced}} to tape {{the scene of a}} preliminary test of students' practice to aseptically handle syringes. These video-tapes taken were released to students to watch and to refer back to for their self-study. Students were consequently divided into four groups on how to utilize the video-tapes. The scores of the preliminary and final test and their differences were statistically compared by the groups. The results suggested that the use of video-tapes is effective for the achievement of skills in delicate techniques of nursing care and especially the utilization upon their own initiative leads to a more successful result...|$|R
40|$|M. Cur. Abstract: The {{occupational}} health nurse functions within a {{legal and ethical}} framework and is challenged by the working conditions in the steel industry that result in ill health and injuries to the employees. The managers’ focus is on financial gain rather than the employees’ health and safety, which frustrates the {{occupational health}} nurse. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore and describe the challenges experienced by occupational health nurses working in the steel industry in the East Rand region of Gauteng, in order to describe the recommendations that will address these challenges. A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive, and contextual research design was used. A purposeful sampling method was used. Data were collected by means of semi-structured individual interviews until data was saturated at the tenth participant. A <b>video-tape</b> <b>recorder</b> was used for accurate data collection. A qualitative coding method of data analysis was utilised. Five themes and their related sub-themes emerged from the findings as follows: 1. role clarification challenge of occupational health nurses by managers, trade unions, and employees; 2. compensation claim challenge to occupational health nurses regarding the claims process and procedures. 3. occupational health nurse’s ethical and professional challenges, 4. referral challenges, such as fear of referral by occupational health nurses and outsourcing of specialists disregarding their competence; and 5. occupational health nurses’ dissatisfaction, fear, and frustration due lack of resources and workload with less pay. A naturalistic paradigm consisting of credibility, transferability, dependability, and conformability was utilised to ascertain trustworthiness. Ethical standards were ensured regarding the principles of respect of persons and beneficence and justice.. Findings were conceptualised within relevant literature and recommendations were made to support the occupational health nurses regarding their challenges in the steel industry. Limitations and conclusions were made...|$|R

Thivend (Eds.), Digestive physiology and metabolism in ruminants: Proceedings of the 5 th International Symposium on Ruminant Physiology (pp. 35 - 51). Clermont-Ferrand: MTP Press Ltd. A radiological study of the motility of the stomach and small intestine {{and the movement of}} their contents was undertaken to define, in detail, the forms of contractions and their effect on digesta. A variety of radiographic techniques were employed depending on the information sought. For continuous observation over extended time periods fluoroscopy was used which combined image intensification with a closed circuit television chain and <b>video-tape</b> <b>recorder.</b> For detailed analysis of contractions or movements radiographic cine-film, serial spot-films or plain radiographs were used. The radiographic contrast of digesta was enhanced by the addition of barium sulphate which was either administered orally or introduced to a particular site through a fistula or cannula. Stainless steel wire loops sutured into particular structures formed radio-opaque markers of sites of specific interest. In the study of the small intestine the electrical activity of the intestinal wall was recorded in conjunction with the radiographic techniques. The sequential contractions of the compartments, folds and pillars of the reticulo-rumen that comprise A and B sequences were found {{to be the result of}} waves of contraction migrating across reticulo-rumen caudally from the reticulum and cranially from the caudal ventral blind sac. The different character of A and B sequences in the fasted and replete animal reflected waves of contraction that migrated at different speeds over varying distances. The pattern of digesta flow within the reticulo-rumen followed a consistant pattern suggesting that the selection of digesta for onward passage to the omasum was by flotation. The pattern of gas movement suggested that the displacement of gas from the dorsal rumen into the caudal ventral blind sac initiated B sequences of contraction. No movement of the omasum was observed radiographically other than that imposed by contiguous structures, especially the reticulum. The most prominent feature of abomasal motility was peristaltic contractions moving towards the pylorus at a frequency which remained constant irrespective of the degree of abomasal distension. Abomasal distension was found to inhibit A sequences in the reticulo-rumen and to alter the pattern of digesta movement in the small intestine. The presence of peristaltic contractions on the abomasum was related to activity in the duodenum and orad jejunum. The movement of digesta in the small intestine was of two basic forms; patterns of movement that were characteristic for a particular region and migrating patterns of movement. These patterns were associated with the electrical activity recorded from the intestinal wall. Alterations to the flow of digesta through the small intestine caused by increased flow through the pylorus, additions or subtractions through T cannulae or the insertion of re-entrant cannulae at certain sites caused marked changes in the patterns of digesta movement. It was concluded that the basic motility pattern in both the stomach and the small intestine is migrating waves of contraction. The pattern in which these waves occur results from interactions between (a) the flow of digesta, (b) the degree of distension either local or in adjacent regions and (c) the pace-setter - imposed via the vagus, on the reticulo-rumen and by the slow wave frequency on the abomasum and small intestine...|$|R
