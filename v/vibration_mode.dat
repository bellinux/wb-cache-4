2500|$|The {{problem in}} the igniter fuel lines was not {{detected}} during ground testing because a stainless steel mesh covering [...] the fuel line became saturated with liquid air due to the extreme cold of the liquid hydrogen flowing through it. The liquid air damped a <b>vibration</b> <b>mode</b> that became evident when tests were conducted in a vacuum after the Apollo 6 flight. This was also a simple fix, involving replacing the flexible bellows section where the break occurred with a loop of stainless steel pipe. The S-IVB used the same J-2 engine design as the S-II {{and so it was}} decided that an igniter line problem had also stopped the third stage from reigniting in Earth orbit. [...] Ground testing confirmed that the slight underperformance seen in the first S-IVB burn was consistent with damage to the igniter line.|$|E

40|$|The low-order <b>vibration</b> <b>modes</b> of a {{reciprocating}} compressor were studied {{by means of}} numerical simulation and experimental validation. A shell element model, a beam element model, and two solid element models were established to investigate the effects of bolted joints and element types on low-order <b>vibration</b> <b>modes</b> of the compressor. Three typical cases were compared to check the effect of locations of moving parts on the <b>vibration</b> <b>modes</b> of the compressor. A forced modal test with the MRIT (Multiple References Impact Test) technique was conducted to validate the simulation results. Among four numerical models, the solid element model with the bolt-pretension method showed the best accuracy compared with experimental data but the worst computational efficiency. The shell element model is recommended to predict the low-order <b>vibration</b> <b>modes</b> of the compressor with regard to effectiveness and usefulness. The sparsely distributed bolted joints with a small bonded region on the contact surface were key bolted joints that had greater impacts on the low-order <b>vibration</b> <b>modes</b> of the compressor than the densely distributed bolted joints.

The electron transport is attributed to the shuttle mechanism where moving colloid particles carry charges. The colloid-particle motion induced by the source-drain voltage shows periodic and/or quasiperiodic vibrations, and the current value depends on the <b>vibration</b> <b>modes.</b> Shot noise that is uncorrelated with the colloid-particle motion causes transitions between the periodic and quasiperiodic <b>vibration</b> <b>modes,</b> resulting in random switching between the current levels corresponding to the <b>vibration</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R
30|$|The typical <b>vibration</b> <b>modes</b> also {{arise if}} the elastic {{components}} {{such as the}} thin ring gear are considered [11, 12].

Tanna and Lim [15, 16] examined the ring gear’s free vibration and proved the elastic <b>vibration</b> <b>modes,</b> including in-plane extensional, radial inextensional, out-of-plane bending, and torsional deformations. It seems that similar modes to those in Refs. [11, 12] can be found for the helical planetary ring gear even when considering various deformations owing to the symmetries. However, {{it could be a}} challenge to develop an analytical model incorporating many deformations. Even so, the theoretical analysis is another difficulty to be overcome.|$|R

Optimal order error estimates are proved for displacements, rotations and shear stresses of the <b>vibration</b> <b>modes,</b> as well as a double order of convergence for the vibration frequencies.

This is a so-called torsional <b>vibration</b> <b>mode</b> (which {{is different from the}} transversal or longitudinal <b>vibration</b> <b>mode),</b> whereby when {{the left side of the}} roadway went down, the right side would rise, and vice versa (i.e., the two halves of the bridge twisted in opposite directions), with the center line of the road remaining still (motionless). Two men proved this point by walking along the center line, unaffected by the flapping of the roadway rising and falling to each side. This vibration was caused by aeroelastic fluttering.|$|E

A visualization of <b>vibration</b> <b>modes</b> is a starting point and different methods {{can be used to}} visualize <b>vibration</b> <b>modes.</b> Some methods which incorporate an inverse calculation of surface velocity from the sound pressure on some boundary have already been proposed, among others. A direct inverse method based on the discretized Rayleigh integral was used in our work, to demonstrate that microphones should be placed close to the vibrating structure to provide an acoustic transfer matrix with a low condition number. It is demonstrated, that there is practically no need for the calculation of the inverse matrix if microphones are placed in a very near field of the vibrating structure. A single microphone placed in a very near field together with a reference vibration sensor provides sufficient information for producing the images of <b>vibration</b> <b>modes.</b> Analytical results, numerical results, FEM simulations and measurement results were used to prove that properties of the sound pressure in a very near field permit a cost effective visualization of the <b>vibration</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{solid state}} physics, a surface phonon is the quantum of a lattice <b>vibration</b> <b>mode</b> {{associated}} with a solid surface. Similar to the ordinary lattice vibrations in a bulk solid (whose quanta are simply called phonons), the nature of surface vibrations depends on details of periodicity and symmetry of a crystal structure. Surface vibrations are however distinct from the bulk vibrations, as they arise from the abrupt termination of a crystal structure at {{the surface of a}} solid. Knowledge of surface phonon dispersion gives important information related to the amount of surface relaxation, the existence and distance between an adsorbate and the surface, and information regarding presence, quantity, and type of defects existing on the surface.|$|E
50|$|From the physical-mathematical standpoint, {{the form}} of the nodal {{patterns}} is predetermined by the shape of the body set in vibration or, in the case of acoustic waves in a gas, the shape of the cavity in which the gas is contained. The sound wave, therefore, does not influence at all the shape of the vibrating body or the shape of the nodal patterns. The only thing that changes due to the vibration is the arrangement of the sand. The image formed by the sand, in turn, is influenced by the frequency spectrum of the vibration only because each <b>vibration</b> <b>mode</b> is characterized by a specific frequency. Therefore, the spectrum of the signal that excites the vibration determines which patterns are actually nodally displayed.|$|E
