5|$|R.C. Pro-Am II was {{developed}} by Rare and published by Tradewest. It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in December1992. Nintendo Power praised the game's controls and upgrade options, which made the game strategic. The magazine criticized the difficulty as unfair, with aircraft hazards that gave players no reaction time in which to dodge attacks. Nintendo Magazine System praised the game overall and its multiplayer in particular, but felt that better games were available. In 1993, GamePro said that the game was better than its predecessor, but noted that the graphics and sound could have been better. Jeuxvideo.com appreciated how the sequel's cars had better traction, but thought the game was technically unrefined considering its few advances in four years' time. For example, they criticized Rare for recycling the original game's audio. In 1994, Game Players had high praise for the game's multiplayer, screeching sound effects, <b>vehicle</b> <b>handling,</b> and replay value. They criticized its lack of in-game music and current weapon indicators, and struggled to anticipate turns in the track in the game's angled perspective.|$|E
25|$|Forza Motorsport 6 is {{a racing}} video game {{which allows the}} player to race many {{vehicles}} across different racing disciplines and courses. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>handling</b> is simulation-based, meaning that each vehicle behaves as closely to its real-world counterpart as possible. Courses are primarily digital representations of real tracks, with 22 tracks based on real locations, and four being fictional. Races consist of up to 24 vehicles competing, and weather elements such as rain can affect <b>vehicle</b> <b>handling.</b>|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{found that}} the game offers a better variety of {{vehicles}} than Grand Theft Auto III, and found them easier to control; GameSpot's Gerstmann named the driving [...] "more exciting and dangerous", and IGN's Perry found the motorcycle's controls pleasing. In addition to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>handling,</b> reviewers noted improvements in the targeting and shooting mechanics, although still recognised issues. Helgeson of Game Informer wrote that [...] "targeting is improved {{to the point where}} combat can actually be fun".|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{found the}} combat system was more {{responsive}} {{than in previous}} games, particularly praising {{the addition of the}} cover system. Justin Calvert of GameSpot wrote that the cover system makes the game's combat a [...] "huge improvement" [...] over previous games. Reiner of Game Informer agreed, writing that the targeting system makes players feel responsible for all deaths. IGN's Goldstein praised the fluidity of the cover system, and felt that the auto aim mechanic is a [...] "great help in larger battles". GamesRadar's Walter wrote that the cover system has [...] "paved the way to a new style of mission". David McComb of Empire called the combat [...] "sharp and instinctive", and Hicks of Official Xbox Magazine felt that the cover system allows players to execute an attack plan. In addition to the combat system, most reviewers noted the <b>vehicle</b> <b>handling</b> was more realistic than in previous games. Robinson of Computer and Video Games felt that the <b>vehicle</b> <b>handling</b> echoed realism, while Hicks of Official Xbox Magazine called the vehicle selection [...] "excellent". Costantino of Game Revolution praised the improvement of the game's mechanics, particularly the physics engine's advanced vehicle and character animations.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{found the}} {{land-based}} vehicles more responsive {{and easier to}} control than in previous games. Game Informers Bertz explained that [...] "cars have a proper sense of weight, while retaining the agility necessary for navigating through traffic at high speeds". In addition to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>handling,</b> most reviewers noted the shooting mechanics were tighter {{than they had been}} in previous games, but Destructoid's Sterling felt that in spite of the improvements, auto-aim was [...] "twitchy and unreliable" [...] and cover mechanics [...] "still come off as dated and unwieldy". Some reviewers felt the game solved a continual problem by adding mid-mission checkpoints.|$|E
500|$|Gameplay {{mechanics}} were {{singled out}} as being particularly poor. The third-person shooter sections suffered from poor camera-angle management, making targeting enemies feel [...] "awkward and disjointed". Enemy artificial intelligence for these sections was described as predictable and basic, adopting repeated firing stances or ignoring the character despite being shot repeatedly. Sniper variants of this fared better. The vehicle sections were also disappointing, with physics and <b>vehicle</b> <b>handling</b> being rated poorly. Vehicles were described as feeling [...] "slow and clapped out", with pursuits described as being [...] "boring". The use of AI in these sections were heavily criticized for being predictable and simplistic, with enemy vehicles having no regard for their own safety. The puzzle games were also received badly, being described as [...] "15 shades of easy and 20 shades of terrible". Interrogation scenes were, in contrast, well liked, with reviewers finding the dialogue during these scenes entertaining.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a physically intuitive method for altering a <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>handling</b> characteristics through active steering intervention. A full state feedback controller augments the driver’s steering command via steer-by-wire to achieve desired handling behavior. Accurate estimates of vehicle states {{are available from}} a combination of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) sensor measurements. By canceling the effects of steering system dynamics and tire disturbance forces, the steer-by-wire system is able to track commanded steer angle with minimal error. Experimental results verify that with precise steering control and accurate state information, a <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>handling</b> characteristics can be modified to match driver preference or to compensate for changes in operating conditions...|$|R

2500|$|A {{concern about}} {{highways}} with narrow paved shoulders is {{the condition of}} the adjacent gravel shoulder. Sometimes, the paved and gravel shoulders are combined as the [...] "recovery zone" [...] beyond the rumble strip. However, if the gravel is loose, soft, non-level, eroded, or there is an [...] "edge-drop" [...] from the pavement to the gravel, then the gravel shoulder portion will be ineffective for recovery, especially at highway speeds. [...] When a vehicle's tires sink into a soft shoulder, thus compromising <b>vehicle</b> <b>handling,</b> it is known as [...] "vehicle tripping".|$|E
25|$|ESC {{can work}} on any surface, from dry {{pavement}} to frozen lakes. It reacts to and corrects skidding much faster and more effectively than the typical human driver, often before the driver is even aware of any imminent loss of control. In fact, this led to some concern that ESC could allow drivers to become overconfident in their <b>vehicle's</b> <b>handling</b> and/or their own driving skills. For this reason, ESC systems typically inform the driver when they intervene, so that the driver knows that the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>handling</b> limits have been approached. Most activate a dashboard indicator light and/or alert tone; some intentionally allow the vehicle's corrected course to deviate very slightly from the driver-commanded direction, {{even if it is}} possible to more precisely match it.|$|R

2500|$|General Motors (GM) {{worked with}} Delphi Automotive and {{introduced}} {{its version of}} ESC called [...] "StabiliTrak" [...] in 1997 for select Cadillac models. StabiliTrak was made standard equipment on all GM SUVs and vans sold in the U.S. and Canada by 2007 except for certain commercial and fleet vehicles. While the [...] "StabiliTrak" [...] name is used on most General Motors vehicles for the U.S. market, the [...] "Electronic Stability Control" [...] identity is used for GM overseas brands, such as Opel, Holden and Saab, except {{in the case of}} Saab's 9-7X which also uses the [...] "StabiliTrak" [...] name. The same year, Cadillac introduced an integrated <b>vehicle</b> <b>handling</b> and software control system, called Integrated Chassis Control System (ICCS), on the Cadillac Eldorado. It involves an omnibus computer integration of engine, traction control, Stabilitrak electronic stability control, steering, and adaptive continuously variable road sensing suspension (CVRSS), with the intent of improving responsiveness to driver input, performance, and overall safety, similar to Toyota/Lexus Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management.|$|E

Contrary to common misperceptions, setup is not used to maximize the performance of the engine, but to optimize it for the track at which it is being used. For example, motorcycle racers frequently detune their engines to reduce performance and power output so as to ensure the bike accelerates in a predictable manner.|$|R
