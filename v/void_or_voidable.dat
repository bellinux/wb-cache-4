25|$|A nullity {{order is}} one which annuls a <b>void</b> <b>or</b> <b>voidable</b> civil partnership. Section 49 of the Act {{provides}} that a civil partnership is void {{on grounds of}} ineligibility to register, if the parties: disregarded certain requirements as {{to the formation of}} the partnership, where any party is a minor, where any person whose consent is required (e.g. a parent) has forbidden the formation of the partnership and the court has not given its consent. Where a civil partnership is voidable, applications for nullity orders are subject to the bars of time, knowledge of defect and approbation.|$|E

Here upon filing a petition by any one spouse before the Court of law a decree of nullity is passed declaring the marriage as null and void.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} ways in which a spouse is chosen, which vary across the world, and include love marriage, {{arranged}} marriage, and forced marriage. The latter is in some jurisdictions a <b>void</b> marriage <b>or</b> a <b>voidable</b> marriage. Forcing someone to marry is also a criminal offense in some countries.|$|R
50|$|In {{contract}} law, {{a mistake}} is an erroneous belief, at contracting, that certain facts are true. It {{can be argued}} as a defense, and if raised successfully {{can lead to the}} agreement in question being found <b>void</b> ab initio <b>or</b> <b>voidable,</b> <b>or</b> alternatively an equitable remedy may be provided by the courts. Common law has identified three different types of mistake in contract: the 'unilateral mistake', the 'mutual mistake' and the 'common mistake'. The distinction between the 'common mistake' and the 'mutual mistake' is important.|$|R
50|$|Other {{grounds for}} divorce may include alcohol or {{substance}} abuse and impotency, infertility or homosexuality of the other party that was not discussed before the union. Strictly speaking, some jurisdictions may interpret the failure to disclose such conditions in advance as actual or constructive fraud that renders the marriage <b>void,</b> <b>or</b> at least <b>voidable</b> unless and until accepted by the other party once s/he learns of the condition(s), and thus serves as grounds for an annulment rather than for dissolution of a theretofore-valid marriage.|$|R

50|$|Depending by jurisdiction, {{a forced}} {{marriage}} {{may or may}} not be <b>void</b> <b>or</b> <b>voidable.</b> Victims may be able to seek redress through annulment or divorce. In England and Wales, the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 stipulates that a forced marriage is voidable. In some jurisdictions, people who had coerced the victim into marriage may face criminal charges.|$|E
50|$|Annulment {{is a legal}} {{procedure}} for declaring a marriage null and void. Unlike divorce, it is usually retroactive, meaning that an annulled marriage {{is considered to be}} invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place (though some jurisdictions provide that the marriage is only void from the date of the annulment; for example, this is the case in section 12 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 in England and Wales).In legal terminology, an annulment makes a <b>void</b> marriage <b>or</b> a <b>voidable</b> marriage null.|$|R
5000|$|Mistake as to {{identity}} occurs when one party - usually deceived by a [...] "rogue" [...] - believes {{themselves to be}} bargaining with another, uninvolved, third party. [...] In a typical situation of this kind, the contract will either be <b>void</b> for mistake, <b>or</b> <b>voidable</b> for fraud. Such a distinction depends on {{the manner in which}} the contract was made. There are two types: (1) Contract made inter absentes, when the parties do not meet face-to-face, e.g. through correspondence; and (2) Contract made inter praesentes -- when the parties meet face-to-face [...] One commentator states [...] "'there are few more vexed areas of contract law' than mistake of identity." [...] The English approach provides less protection to the purchaser from a rogue than American law.|$|R

Students are then directed to read specific cases and materials and are provided with pertinent questions designed to enhance their knowledge and understanding and ensure that they can apply the principles. Charts, diagrams and suggested tasks are included where appropriate to encourage active participation and learning and further explain and simplify material. Contract Law is designed for students who have no previous knowledge of contract law. The book covers all aspects of contract law, including: the nature and development of contract law; agreement; consideration; intention to create legal relations; capacities and formalities; terms and their construction; matters rendering a contract <b>void,</b> <b>voidable</b> <b>or</b> unenforceable; performance and termination; remedies; and solving contract problems.

50|$|Although the law {{varies from}} country to country, most {{disputes}} relating to whether a transaction is <b>void</b> <b>or</b> <b>voidable</b> turn {{on the ability to}} transfer title to goods. In many jurisdictions, if a transaction is valid, but voidable, title to good still passes under the transaction, and the recipient may sell them with good title. If the transaction is void, no title passes, and the original seller may reclaim the goods.|$|E
50|$|In the {{situation}} that a marriage is <b>void</b> <b>or</b> <b>voidable,</b> any legitimately interested party (usually {{one of the parties}} to the marriage) can seek a declarator of nullity of marriage from the Court of Session, which will acknowledge that their marriage is void and, in effect, never existed. When making such a ruling the judge has the power to make awards for financial provision, like in a divorce.|$|E
50|$|When the law limits or bars {{a person}} from {{engaging}} in specified activities, any agreements or contracts to do so are either <b>voidable</b> <b>or</b> <b>void</b> for incapacity.

5000|$|The {{common law}} {{will hold a}} {{contract}} to be binding as long the essential elements for a contract are present (i.e. agreement, consideration, certainty etc.). However, in certain situations equity may intervene and make the contract either <b>voidable</b> <b>or</b> <b>void.</b> The rule in Yerkey v Jones and the principles of non-est factum, misrepresentation, and special disadvantage. {{are some of the}} situations in which equity may intervene and make the contract <b>voidable</b> <b>or</b> <b>void.</b> To note, a defence to the principle in Yerkey v Jones, is that the [...] "wives guarantee" [...] will not apply if the lender can show that they took reasonable steps to ensure they had reasonable grounds for believing that the consent was fairly obtained.|$|R

50|$|A {{marriage}} may be nullified as <b>void</b> <b>or</b> <b>voidable</b> much in {{the same}} manner as a contract. A marriage is void when the parties do not have the capacity to marry (known as the essential validity of the marriage). Thus, marriages between blood relations, or parties already married, underage, or otherwise unable to consent would all be invalid for lack of essential validity. A marriage is voidable and can be annulled by a court if the spouses are incapable of consummating the marriage.|$|E
50|$|A nullity {{order is}} one which annuls a <b>void</b> <b>or</b> <b>voidable</b> civil partnership.

5000|$|In SAYC, a {{balanced}} hand has no voids, no singletons, and at most one doubleton; non-balanced hands include all others. In OK Bridge 2/1, {{a balanced}} hand is without <b>voids</b> <b>or</b> singletons: a non-balanced hand has one <b>or</b> more <b>voids</b> <b>or</b> singletons whereas hands {{with one or}} more doubletons are considered semi-balanced. Hands with <b>voids</b> <b>or</b> singletons add strength to declarer’s situation, and the ability to show this strength clearly (yet separately from high card points) is of considerable value. For example, in the sequence 1C-1D-1NT, the openers jump to 1NT is showing a balanced hand or semi-balanced hand with 12-14 points (i.e. no <b>voids</b> <b>or</b> singletons). Alternatively, the sequence 1C-1D-1H usually shows 4 hearts with a side singleton <b>or</b> <b>void,</b> and 1C-1D-1S usually shows 4 spades with a side singleton <b>or</b> <b>void</b> and denies 4 hearts. (It shows extra strength and denies a balanced minimum opening hand. These bids are also used with 16 points or more and semi-balanced hands, in which case it is undesirable to show a balanced minimum 1NT, and you also could not open 1NT.) ...|$|R

Sometimes, the issue of validity arises during a subsequent divorce or is raised after the remarriage or death of one of the spouses; no valid marriage may mean no alimony, no prenuptial agreement or no widow's benefits as a <b>void</b> <b>or</b> <b>voidable</b> marriage may be annulled.|$|E
5000|$|For example, {{a seller}} of a used {{automobile}} sells {{his car to}} a buyer, and puts into the contract of sale the statement: [...] "The buyer accepts the automobile AS IS, WITH ALL FAULTS." [...] Two minutes after the buyer drives off with it, the engine seizes, and the car stalls. Unless the buyer can show {{that there was some}} fraud involved, or the seller breached an express warranty, the buyer is not entitled to a refund. This would be a specific example where fraud in the inducement could outweigh anything in the contract, express or implied: it simply doesn't matter what disclaimer or limitations may be found in the contract, if the contract is <b>void</b> (<b>or</b> <b>voidable)</b> for any reason.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{decisions}} from Australian courts have also affected the circumstances where legal action {{can be taken}} regarding contracts, recognising factors that change contractual obligations.These include situations involving [...] "unconscionable dealings", where one party is at a [...] "special disadvantage", or where a party exercises [...] "undue influence", and will commonly result in the contract being declared <b>void</b> <b>or</b> <b>voidable</b> by the court. Other vitiating factors may include [...] "misrepresentation" [...] if it amounts to a false statement of a material fact made by the representor to the representee in order to induce the representee {{to enter into the}} contract and which has this effect, [...] "misleading and deceptive conduct", [...] "mistake", [...] "duress", and [...] "unconscionable conduct". In general law, the remedy for vitiating factors is rescission and full restoration, even in cases of third party impropriety.|$|E
