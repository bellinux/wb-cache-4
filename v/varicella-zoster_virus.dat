40|$|Improvement {{of vaccine}} {{coverage}} against vaccine-preventable viral infections {{is the prime}} task for preventing outbreaks of viral infections. To elucidate the promoting factors for complete vaccination against measles, rubella, mumps, and <b>varicella-zoster</b> <b>viruses,</b> we conducted a case-control study among single university students in Japan. Information on vaccinations and clinico-demographical factors were collected using a self-administered questionnaire and a photocopy of the Maternal and Child Health Handbook. Logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for two-time vaccination against measles and rubella viruses as mandatory vaccinations and at least one-time vaccination against mumps and <b>varicella-zoster</b> <b>viruses</b> as optional vaccinations. A total of 1, 370 (744 medical, 508 paramedical, and 118 pharmaceutical) students were invited to participate, 960 (70. 1 %) of whom {{were enrolled in the}} study. Students aged < 20 years had a greater propensity for measles and rubella vaccinations (OR 7. 8 [95 % CI, 5. 1 - 11. 8] and OR 6. 1 [95 % CI, 3. 7 - 10. 0], respectively) compared with those aged ≥ 20 years. Students with a history of living over-seas for 1 month or longer were more likely to complete vaccination for measles (OR 4. 4 [95 % CI, 1. 4 - 13. 5] compared with those without such history.

In a few patients with IgM antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus IgM antibodies were also detected. False-positive cytomegalovirus IgM antibody results were observed in sera containing both the rheumatoid factor and cytomegalovirus IgG antibodies. This rheumatoid factor interference was overcome by the absorption of sera with polymerized human gamma globulin. The absorption did not affect true cytomegalovirus IgM antibody titers.

40|$|When mouse {{cytomegalovirus}} was injected subcutaneously into 4 - 12 day old CDI mice {{there was}} infection of dermal cells and the dermal papillae of hair follicles.

Smaller doses (10 (4) pfu) did not cause gross necrosis but damage to follicles resulted in alopecia or sparse hair growth. Skin lesions were not seen after infection of 4 - 8 week old mice, even when the inoculated skin area had been epilated, or when hyaluronidase was mixed with the virus inoculum.

40|$|<b>Varicella-zoster</b> (VZ) <b>virus</b> causes two diseases, {{varicella}} and zoster. Because it was recognizedthat, after varicella, latent VZ virus {{persisted in}} the host and becausevaricel-la {{was thought to be}} a mild disease, there was little impetus in North America to develop a live VZ vaccine. More recently, it has become apparent that currently available methods of prevention and treatment of severe varicella are not always efficacious. With the development of a liveattenuated VZ vaccine by Takahashi and the successful use of the vaccine in immunocompromised children in Japan, there has been an in-creased interest in North America in immunization against varicella. In this article the natural history of VZ infections and the immunologic reactions to VZ virus are de-scribed, and the development and use of VZ vaccine in Japan are reviewed. Plans for trials of VZ vaccine in immunocompromised North American children are outlined. The major questions concerning the large-scale use of VZ vaccine are presented.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} a systematic infectious screening program {{for patients who}} present with sudden or progressive sensorineural hearing loss (SHL) of unknown cause (negative history and clinical examination). METHOD: Retrospective study of 182 patients with idiopathic SHL. One hundred six patients presented with sudden SHL, and 76 presented with progressive SHL. Serologies for herpes simplex and <b>varicella-zoster</b> <b>viruses</b> (immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G titers), Lyme disease (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), syphilis (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption or microhemagglutination-Treponema pallidum test) and human immunodeficiency virus were performed. RESULTS: The serologies were negative in 179 patients. Two patients had positive serologies for Lyme disease and another tested positive for syphilis. Both cases of suspected Lyme disease were later excluded by Western blot analysis and lumbar puncture (two false-positives). The patient with serologic syphilis was diagnosed as having latent syphilis after neurosyphilis was excluded. CONCLUSION: The infection screening was positive in only 1 (0. 6 %) of 182 patients: the patient who was diagnosed with latent syphilis. On {{the basis of these}} results and taking into account the cost of systematic screening, we propose that serologic tests be limited to patients with suspect histories or symptomatologies, except for patients with a diagnosis of syphilis...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{developments}} {{have increased the}} options for treatment of viral infections. Vidarabine, an agent originally released for herpes simplex encephalitis, has more recently {{been shown to be}} of benefit in neonatal herpes simplex infection and in varicella-zoster infections in immunocompromised hosts. The introduction of acyclovir represents a major advance in antiviral therapy because of its low host toxicity and marked selectivity for herpes simplex and <b>varicella-zoster</b> <b>viruses.</b> Extensive controlled clinical trials demonstrate efficacy in the treatment of infections caused by these viruses in the immunocompromised host and in genital herpes simplex infections in normal hosts. The use of recombinant DNA technology has increased the purity, variety, and availability of interferons for clinical trial. Earlier experience with natural buffy coat-derived alpha interferon showed efficacy in the treatment of varicella-zoster infections in the immunocompromised host, as well as prophylaxis of herpes virus infections in high-risk populations. These results have to be confirmed using the newer interferon preparations. Under development are a variety of new drugs with broadened viral spectrum and improved pharmacokinetic properties. These include nucleoside analogues and novel interferons with modified amino acid sequences.

40|$|The {{process whereby}} <b>varicella-zoster</b> (V-Z) <b>virus</b> is inactivated in vitro by immune human {{peripheral}} blood leukocytes stimulated with V-Z antigen was examined.

Viral inactivation could be blocked by addition of V-Z antiserum to either the stimulation phase of the reaction or the inactivation phase, further demonstrating the specificity of the reaction. In addition these blocking experiments suggested that modulation of V-Z membrane antigen by antiserum occurred with an accompanying loss of immunological recognition of virus-infected cells. Inactivation of V-Z virus in vitro in this study appeared not to be dependent upon the secretion of interferon or upon antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

Varicella or zoster infections in humans produced neutralizing and complement-fixing antibody responses to each of the simian viruses; the responses were more marked in zoster infections than in varicella infections but, in most patients, antibody levels produced to the simian viruses were much lower than those to the homologous V-Z virus...|$|R

40|$|The {{preparation}} of antigenic materials capable of specific fixation of complement {{in the presence}} of convalescent phase sera from patients with varicella and herpes zoster is described. Satisfactory antigens were obtained by the repetitive harvest and subsequent concentration of the pooled nutrient fluids from bottle cultures of human embryonic skin-muscle tissue or of monkey kidney tissue infected with varicella or herpes zoster viruses. Specific fixation of complement was also demonstrated with antigens prepared from extracts of the infected cell sheets harvested from bottle cultures. In individuals with varicella, complement-fixing antibody usually appeared in the serum 4 or 5 days after the development of the exanthem and further significant increases in titer were characteristically observed during the 2 nd week of illness. The complement-fixing antibody response in herpes zoster tended to follow the same pattern as in varicella, with the exception that in sera from some individuals relatively high titers were present in the acute phase specimen. Complement-fixing antigens prepared from varicella strains or from a zoster strain reacted to essentially the same degree with convalescent sera from the homologous and the heterologous clinical entities. The varicella-zoster antigens did not fix complement {{in the presence of}} paired sera obtained from a limited number of individuals with primary infections due to herpes simplex virus or from individuals with generalized vaccinia infection. Specific inhibition in vitro of the focal cytopathic process produced by the <b>varicella-zoster</b> <b>viruses</b> was demonstrated. This was accomplished by the incorporation of the sera under test as constituents of nutrient media of the cultures, either prior to or {{at the time of their}} inoculation with virus. The neutralization of focal cytopathogenicity thus obtained was relative in degree and never absolute; it was therefore assayed by repetitive counts of the number of focal lesions per culture in the various test groups. Inhibition of varicella-zoster viral cytopathogenicity occurred in the presence of convalescent serum from either clinical entity. The results of the immunologic studies with the viruses of herpes zoster and varicella as propagated in vitro are considered as providing further evidence in support of the concept of the close relationship and probable identity of the two agents...|$|R

Convalescent-phase sera from human zoster cases had comparable levels of neutralizing antibody for both DHV and V-Z virus. Patas monkeys involved in an outbreak of DHV infection showed seroconversion to both DHV and V-Z virus by neutralization tests and to V-Z virus by complement fixation tests. The demonstration of the close antigneic relationship between DHV and V-Z virus suggests that DHV may be useful in an animal model system for studies on the latency and reactivation of V-Z virus...|$|R
