5|$|English <b>verbs</b> are inflected for {{tense and}} aspect, and marked for {{agreement}} with third person singular subject. Only the copula verb {{to be is}} still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects. Auxiliary <b>verbs</b> such as have and be are paired with <b>verbs</b> in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary <b>verbs</b> differ from other <b>verbs</b> in {{that they can be}} followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.|$|E

5|$|<b>Verbs</b> are a {{class of}} word in Wagiman which {{contains}} fewer than 50 members. As it is a closed class, no more <b>verbs</b> are possible. They are often monosyllabic verb roots and all are vowel-final. Wagiman <b>verbs</b> obligatorily inflect for person and number of core arguments, and for the tense and aspect of the clause. A small set of <b>verbs</b> may take a non-finite suffix -yh, in which {{it may not be}} further inflected for person or tense. That non-finite verb must then co-occur with another auxiliary verb.|$|E

The tense or aspect of <b>verbs</b> was also influenced by the conjugation , in the so-called waw-consecutive construction. Default word order was verb–subject–object, and <b>verbs</b> inflected for the number, gender, and person of their subject.

5|$|English has {{two primary}} tenses, past (preterit) and non-past.

The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix -s.|$|E
5|$|English syntax {{relies on}} {{auxiliary}} <b>verbs</b> for many functions including {{the expression of}} tense, aspect and mood. Auxiliary <b>verbs</b> form main clauses, and the main <b>verbs</b> function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb.

Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.|$|E

5|$|Greenlandic is an ergative language.
