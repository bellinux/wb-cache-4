25|$|The {{precursor}} for {{the modern}} home loan banking services were the distance banking services over electronic media from the early 1980s. The term 'online' became popular in the late 1980s and referred {{to the use of}} a terminal, keyboard and TV (or monitor) to access the banking system using a phone line. 'Home banking' can also refer to the use of a numeric keypad to send tones down a phone line with instructions to the bank. Online services started in New York in 1981 when four of the city's major banks (Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover) offered home banking services. using the <b>videotex</b> system. Because of the commercial failure of <b>videotex</b> these banking services never became popular except in France where the use of <b>videotex</b> (Minitel) was subsidised by the telecom provider and the UK, where the Prestel system was used.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{a number of}} higher {{extension}} levels were envisaged for the specification, based on ideas then being promoted for worldwide <b>videotex</b> standards (telephone dial-up services offering a similar mix of text and graphics).|$|E
25|$|MTS was {{a pioneer}} in {{offering}} <b>videotex</b> at the commercial level. In 1981, it partnered with Infomart (then owned by the Torstar and Southam newspaper chains) to create the Grassroots service, providing information relevant to farmers on the Canadian prairies. Customers paid $47.50 per month to subscribe to Grassroots, plus connection fees to DATAPAC. Terminal equipment was manufactured by Norpak.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, Martin Nisenholtz invited Fekner, Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and John Matos/Crash to {{experiment}} {{on the early}} interactive teletext system Telidon at NYU’s Alternate Media Center, the predecessor of its Interactive Telecommunications Program. Fekner received his first international award at Toronto's Video Culture Festival in the <b>Videotex</b> category for Toxic Wastes From A to Z, an 8-bit computer graphics [...] animation created at AMC which featured a rap by k-8 students from a South Bronx school. In the New York Times, Matthew Mirapaul said, [...] "Fekner's work incorporates jagged, pixilated computer-generated imagery because 'its characteristic of the medium....it's almost like the drip in a Jackson Pollock,' Mr. Fekner stated." ...|$|E
5000|$|In fact, {{the most}} {{successful}} online services of the period were not <b>videotex</b> services at all. Despite the promises that <b>videotex</b> would appeal to the mass market, the <b>videotex</b> services were comfortably out-distanced by Dow Jones News/Retrieval (begun in 1973), CompuServe and (somewhat further behind) The Source, both begun in 1979. [...] None were <b>videotex</b> services, nor did they use the fixed frame-by-frame <b>videotex</b> model for content. Instead all three used search functions and text interfaces to deliver files that were {{for the most part}} plain ASCII. Other ASCII-based services that became popular included Delphi (launched in 1983) and GEnie (launched in 1985).|$|E
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} experiments with marketing <b>videotex</b> to consumers in the U.S. was by Radio Shack, which sold a consumer <b>videotex</b> terminal, essentially a single-purpose predecessor to the TRS-80 Color Computer, in outlets across the country. Sales were anemic. Radio Shack later sold a <b>videotex</b> software and hardware package for the Color Computer.|$|E
50|$|But {{when using}} <b>Videotex</b> the {{information}} is on a computer-platform owned and managed by the information-provider. The <b>Videotex</b> system connected the end-user to the Datanet 1 line of the information-provider. It {{was up to the}} information provider if the access-point (the box directly behind the telephone line) supported the <b>videotex</b> protocol or that it was a transparent connection where the host handled the protocol.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} {{aimed to}} bring a degree of harmonisation between Europe's emerging <b>videotex</b> systems, which had been diverging along national lines. It recognised four baseline profiles (with conformance criteria set out in Annex C) based on existing <b>videotex</b> services: ...|$|E
50|$|Netherlands: The then {{state-owned}} {{phone company}} PTT (now KPN) operated two platforms: Viditel (nl) and <b>Videotex</b> Nederland (nl). The main {{difference was that}} Viditel used one big central host where <b>Videotex</b> used a central access system responsible for realizing the correct connection to the required host: owned and managed by others. The <b>Videotex</b> services offered access via several premium rate numbers and the information/service provider could choose the costs for accessing his service. Depending on the number used, the tariff could vary 0-1 Dutch guilders (0.00-0.45 euro) per minute. Some private networks such as Travelnet (for travel-agencies) and RDWNet for automotive industry, used the same platform as <b>Videotex</b> Nl but used dedicated dial-in phone numbers, dedicated access-hardware and also used authentication. Although the protocol used in France for Minitel was slightly different than the international standard you could use the 'international' terminal (or PC's with the correct terminal-emulation software) to access the French services. It was possible to connect to most French Minitel services via the Dutch <b>Videotex</b> network, but the price per minute was considerably higher: most French Minitel services were reachable via the dial-in number 06-7900 which had a tariff of 1 guilder/minute (approx. €0,45/minute) Both Viditel and <b>Videotex</b> were shut down between 1997 and 1999, and the parent company behind <b>Videotex</b> Nederland was subsequently renamed as Planet Media Group.|$|E
50|$|Some people confuse <b>videotex</b> {{with the}} Internet. Although early <b>videotex</b> {{providers}} in the 1970s encountered many issues {{similar to those}} faced by Internet service providers 20 years later, {{it is important to}} emphasize that the two technologies evolved separately and reflect fundamentally different assumptions about how to computerize communications.|$|E

50|$|A third mode {{was entered}} {{with a special}} boot floppy which turned the Aster into a <b>Videotex</b> {{terminal}} with a 40x25 display and a <b>Videotex</b> character set, The software used the built in RS232 interface of the Aster to control a modem through which it could contact a Prestel service provider.|$|E
50|$|After the {{invention}} of teletext was {{the invention}} of <b>videotex,</b> of which Prestel was the world's first system, launching commercially in 1979 with various British newspapers such as the Financial Times lining up to deliver newspaper stories online through it. <b>Videotex</b> closed down in 1986 due to failing to meet end-user demand.|$|E
5000|$|Viewdata: An {{alternative}} term to <b>videotex,</b> used {{in particular}} by the British Post Office and generally in Britain and the USA. Elsewhere, the term <b>videotex</b> is preferred. Viewdata was coined by the BPO {{in the early}} 1970s, but found to be unacceptable as a trade name, hence its use as a generic.|$|E
50|$|In the Netherlands {{the then}} {{state-owned}} phone company PTT (now KPN) operated two platforms: Viditel and <b>Videotex</b> Nederland. From the user perspective {{the main difference}} between these systems was that Viditel used standard dial-in phone numbers where <b>Videotex</b> used premium-rate telephone numbers. For Viditel you needed a (paid) subscription {{and on top of that}} you paid for each page you visited. For <b>Videotex</b> services you normally didn't need a subscription nor was there the need to authenticate: you paid for the services via the premium rate of the modem-connection based on connection time, regardless of the pages or services you retrieved.|$|E

50|$|In {{a strict}} definition, <b>videotex</b> is any system that {{provides}} interactive content and displays it {{on a video}} monitor such as a television, typically using modems to send data in both directions. A close relative is teletext, which sends data in one direction only, typically encoded in a television signal. All such systems are occasionally referred to as viewdata. Unlike the modern Internet, traditional <b>videotex</b> services were highly centralized.|$|E
50|$|<b>Videotex</b> {{technology}} was also adopted for use internally within organizations. Digital Equipment Corp (DEC) offered a <b>videotex</b> product (VTX) on the VAX system. Goldman Sachs, for one, adopted and developed an internal fixed income information distribution and bond sales {{system based on}} DEV VTX. Internal systems were overtaken by external vendors, notably Bloomberg, which offered the additional benefit of providing information from different firms and allowing interactive communication between the firms.|$|E

5000|$|In contrast, <b>videotex</b> {{was always}} highly {{centralized}} (except in the French Minitel service, also including thousands of information providers running their own servers {{connected to the}} packet switched network [...] "TRANSPAC"). Even in <b>videotex</b> networks where third-party companies could post their own content and operate special services like forums, a single company usually owned and operated the underlying communications network, developed and deployed the necessary hardware and software, and billed both content providers and users for access. The exception was the transaction processing <b>videotex</b> system developed in the UK by Michael Aldrich in 1979, which brought teleshopping (or online shopping as it was later called) into prominence and was the idea developed later through the Internet. Aldrich's systems were based on minicomputers that could communicate with multiple mainframes. Many systems were installed in the UK including the world's first supermarket teleshopping system.|$|E
