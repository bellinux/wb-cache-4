If the bleeding {{is likely to have}} originated from an aneurysm (as determined by the CT scan appearance), the choice is between cerebral angiography (injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to the brain arteries) and CT angiography (<b>visualizing</b> blood vessels with radiocontrast on a CT scan) to identify aneurysms.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to <b>visualize</b> design {{regulations}} of furniture by means of interactive multimedia technology based on cognitive theories and practical examples. Furthermore, the usage of the <b>visualized</b> regulations to support education, communication, learnability, relevance and attitudes was evaluated. The <b>visualized</b> regulations were the result of a design process involving experts and potential users in collaboration with IKEA of Sweden AB. The results showed a very positive response in using <b>visualized</b> regulations. The approach to <b>visualize</b> the regulations with interactive illustrations and animations resulted in clear presentations of important regulations, and great attitudes. The subjects strongly expressed their opinion to use the <b>visualized</b> regulations developed and tested in the study in their current work. Still, the training and visualization could be improved with more examples and clarifications. These kinds of visualizations have also proved to be applicable in other product areas at IKEA, where new regulations are being <b>visualized.</b> It is likely that the approaches to design and <b>visualized</b> regulations in this case study could function in other branches such as ergonomic evaluations in the car industry. The <b>visualized</b> regulations of bunk beds have been distributed among intended users throughout the organization, and visualizations of other product segments are ongoing...|$|R

JMP Genomics, used for analyzing and <b>visualizing</b> genomics data, requires a SAS component to operate and can access SAS/Genetics and SAS/STAT procedures or invoke SAS macros. JMP Clinical, used for analyzing clinical trial data, can package SAS code within the JSL scripting language and convert SAS code to JMP.|$|E
5|$|Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992) was an American {{scientist}} and cytogeneticist who {{was awarded the}} 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader {{in the development of}} maize cytogenetics, the focus of her research {{for the rest of her}} life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for <b>visualizing</b> maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.|$|E

He joined Yale University's Sheffield Scientific School as a professor of political economy in 1872 and rose to international prominence serving as a chief member of the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition, American representative to the 1878 International Monetary Conference, President of the American Statistical Association in 1882, and inaugural President of the American Economic Association in 1886, {{and vice president of the}} National Academy of Sciences in 1890. Walker also led the 1880 census which resulted in a twenty-two volume census, cementing Walker's reputation as the nation's preeminent statistician.|$|E

5|$|Phase-contrast X-ray imaging (Fig.26) {{refers to}} a variety of {{techniques}} that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues. (For an elementary discussion, see Phase-contrast x-ray imaging (introduction). For a more in-depth review, see Phase-contrast X-ray imaging.) It has become an important method for <b>visualizing</b> cellular and histological structures {{in a wide range of}} biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations. These include propagation-based phase contrast, talbot interferometry, moiré-based far-field interferometry, refraction-enhanced imaging, and x-ray interferometry. These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray imaging, making it possible to see smaller details. A disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray sources, x-ray optics, or high resolution x-ray detectors.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} may {{be studied}} {{by a variety}} of techniques, including both direct and indirect observations. Two experimental techniques that have proved very useful in this area of study are field ion microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. By <b>visualizing</b> the displacement of atoms or clusters over time, it is possible to extract useful information regarding {{the manner in which the}} relevant species diffuse-both mechanistic and rate-related information. In order to study surface diffusion on the atomistic scale it is unfortunately necessary to perform studies on rigorously clean surfaces and in ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions or in the presence of small amounts of inert gas, as is the case when using He or Ne as imaging gas in field-ion microscopy experiments.|$|E
5|$|The PS3 {{client was}} {{developed}} in a collaborative effort between Sony and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March23, 2007.

In the types of calculations it can perform, {{at the time of}} its introduction, the client fit in between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed. However, unlike CPUs and GPUs, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home. The PS3's uniform console environment made technical support easier and made Folding@home more user friendly. The PS3 also has the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level <b>visualizing</b> of the current protein dynamics.|$|E
