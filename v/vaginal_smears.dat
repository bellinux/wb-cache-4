40|$|Cytologic {{studies on}} <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> {{have been carried}} on by many {{investigators}} for a quite long time and there are already numerous excellent results available. However, ever since the report on the diagnostic method for uterine cancers by Papeniceaou in collaboration with Traut in 1953 recomfirmatiom and re-investigation with <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> have gained a new impetus in various fields as an important diagnostic method for malignant tumors. Especially {{in the field of}} gynecology it has been verified that this method is an important supplementary method for the diagnosis of uterine cancers, offering as it does a fairly accurate diagnosis in view point of a possibility of detecting clinically obscure cancers at an early stage. Likewise we have been endeavoring to detect uterine cancers at an early stage by giving screening tests of <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> obtained at the first examination of all the patients visiting our clinic since August, 1957. Besides uterine cancers, there are also many studies on the <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> in inflammation of sexual organs {{as well as in the}} field of the endocrinology. The author also carried out cytologic study on the <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> in benign cases just as in malignant. Namely, the <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> were taken from all the patients visiting our clinic from the beginning of August, 1957 to the end of December, 1958 and microscopic examinations were conducted after Papanicolaou's original method of staining. The results of the examiations were represented by types I, II, IIA, II+, III, IV, and V according to Carter's classification. Furthermore, the specimens obtained from gynecologic patients for the purpose of the screening test were divided into 10 classes according to the diagnosis given at the outpatient clinic, and these were further divided into three grades of those under 40 years, those between 41 to 55 years, and those over 56 years. Taking into consideration the possible cyclic changes because of the smears being taken only once at random, observations were carried out by selecting the samples under the same cyclic condition. By dividing the cells exfoliated in the vagina into five classes of deep cells, sub-basal, intermediate layer cells, superficial layer cells, and cornified cells and as the components other than those of epithelium, into leucocytes, erythrocytes, cervical canal cells, endometnial cells, and histiocytes. The cornification and acidophilic indices were determined. Of the total of 5, 456 cases 472 were diagnosed as positive or possibly-positive by vagnial smears, and 215 cases of the latter were biopsized and 184 of them were revealed to be carcinoma. Those proved to be negative by the vagnial smear test amounted to 4, 948 cases, 457 cases 22 revealed the carcinomatous changes in their biopsy specimens. When the percent age of accuracy by the <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> is calculated, taking the biosy examination as the final criteria, the following results are obtained. Namely, 206 cases were diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma intraepithelial carcinoma or adenocarcinoma by biopsy. Of them 184 cases were diagnosed as positive or possibly-positive by <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears,</b> and 466 cases were revealed to have no cancer by biopsy, and of the latter 457 were negative to the vaginal smear tests. Therefore, the positive percentage is 89. 3 per cent, while the negative percentage is 98. 1 per cent, bringing the rate of accuracy to 93. 7 per cent. Those diagnosed as uterine cancer by <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> and confirmed by biopsy amounted to 206 cases, 3. 7 per cent of the total. In addition, 32 cases of blinically obscure cancers amounting 3. 7 per cent of the total were discovered, proving that this technique is a useful supplementary method of diagnosis for dircovering uterine cancers in an early stage. Furthemore, in the cervical cancer of the uterus both basal and para basal cells can be observed numerously apart from cancer cells, and also leucocytes and erythroeytes can be observed in all cases...|$|E

Study included 245. 048 participants whose VCE (vaginal, cervical, endocervical) smears were examined at Department of clinical cytology of University Hospital Center Osijek from 2003 till 2008. There were 12. 639 (5. 2 %) abnormal findings, and they were divided into three groups: abnormal cells found only in vaginal smear (V), abnormal cells found in vaginal and in at least one other smear (V+) and abnormal cells not found in vaginal smear (C/E). These three groups were analysed in respect to cytological differential diagnosis and age of participants. It was estimated how many women could be additionally included in the screening, if vaginal smear would be included in the Pap test only after 50 years of age. In 6. 9 % of cytologically diagnosed lesions abnormal cells were found exclusively in <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> (0. 35 % of all findings). As for squamous cell lesions, 91. 2 % were mild lesions (ASC and LSIL). Invasive squamous cell carcinoma was not diagnosed exclusively by vaginal smear in either woman under 50 years of age, while in women over 50 years of age it was diagnosed in 2. 3 % of cases. Exclusively by vaginal smear was diagnosed 3. 9 % of all AGC and 6. 3 % of adenocarcinoma, while in 85. 0 % of glandular epithelium lesions abnormal cells were not found in <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears.</b> Two thirds of adenocarcinoma diagnosed exclusively by <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> were endometrial adenocarcinoma, but that is only 10. 3 % of all endometrial carcinoma diagnosed by Pap test.

The hypothesis that female voles are androgenized by exposure to endogenous testosterone was supported by the finding that female voles have high concentrations of plasma testosterone during development. However, perinatal treatment with antiandrogens or antiaromatases did not affect <b>vaginal</b> <b>smear</b> patterns, ovulatory responses to estrogen and progesterone administration, or the behavioral response to testosterone after ovariectomy. Castrated male M. canicaudus did not display female-typical behaviors when treated with estrogen or estrogen plus progesterone in adulthood; perinatal androgen manipulations did not affect the potential for female receptive behaviors in males. Specifically, neither castration within 3 hours of birth nor perinatal treatment with antiandrogens or antiaromatases enhanced behavioral responses to estrogen in male voles. In addition, prolonged neonatal testosterone treatment did not decrease the potential for feminine behaviors in female voles. These findings suggest that the development of female receptive behaviors in voles requires more than the absence of perinatal androgen exposure.

40|$|Ever since Papanicolaou (1923, 1933) first {{reported}} {{the application of}} <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> in determining the changes in pregnancy, cytological studies on the <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> {{in the field of}} obstetrics gained its importance in the application for early diagnosis of pregnancy, for various disturbances and fidings during pregnancy, for the prognosis, for the determination of fetal sex, and for the determination of the delivery time. In this field of study there are numerous works, but reports of the successive follow-up studies on the same subject are scarce and for in between. In view of individual differences in the cytological picture of <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> and various changes under varied conditions it is impossible to carry on accurate observations satisfactorily unless continuous observations be carried on the same subject. Therefore, the author undertook a series of continuous observations as regards changes in <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> in the course of pregnancy from the endocrinological standpoint and studied the diagnostic value of the <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> on the determination of the delivery time and various disturbances, and conducted screening tests for the purpose of detecting uterine cancers as well. The subjects of the present research were 1, 275 patients visiting our obstetrics clinic during the period from July 1, 1957 to the end of December 1958. <b>Vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> were taken from everyone of them, and after staining these smears with Papanicolaou E. A. 36 stain observations were carried on. As for the endocrinological observations the author stupied the percentage of various cells, variations in the cornification index and acidophilic index, charactristics of various cells, and components other than those of the epithelium. The representation of the determined values are classified into I to V grades according to Papanicolaou's method. The Experimental Results 1. In the continuous observations carried on the changes in the <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> of 40 normally pregnant women for the period from the early stage of pregnancy to the stage just before delivery distinct differences can be recognized according to the degree of cleanliness. Namely, in 21 cases whose cleanliness has been maintained at a high degree throughout the period a considerable number of intermediate cells can be observed, and these increase gradually with the advance of pregnancy; but decrease just before delivery. The cornification index is, however, low and keeps on decreasing gradually but it tends to rise before delivery. In the seven cases whose cleanliness has been poor throughout the period the percentage of intermediate cells is low, showing not much variations. The cornification index shows a high percentage with marked fluctuations, and gradually decreasing with the advance of pregnancy, it shows a slight increasing tendency just before delivery. In 12 cases whose cleanliness varied during the period the vaginal smear picture presents a tendency to change the number of various cells above mentioned in proportion to the changes in the clenaliness. 2. Because {{there is a tendency to}} present variations in the number of cells, an increase in leucocyte count and mucus content, the dissemination of cells and a decrease in the stainability of cells during the period before delivery as a forementioned, from these changes in cytological picture it is possible to determine the time of delivery to a certain extent. On the observations in 275 cases the rate of reliability in such a determination amounted to 68 per cent, but it was difficult in those with a low degree of cleanliness. 3.

The most frequent causes are Candida albicans (85 - 95 %) or C. glabrata, and infrequently C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. pseudotropicalis, etc. Objective. The {{aim of the}} study was to investigate efficiency and safety of fenticonazole for vaginal candidiasis treatment. Methods. Therapeutic effect of a single 600 mg fenticonasole vaginal capsule was observed in 417 women, aged 16 - 67, in five centers in Serbia. In all women, before the treatment, vaginal candidiasis was confirmed by testing of <b>vaginal</b> <b>smear.</b> Based on smear findings and associated symptoms observed on the 7 th and 28 th day after therapy administration, treatment results were evaluated. On the next day after drug application the patients recorded by using a questionnaire their own feelings on withdrawal symptoms and possible side effects in the period prior to the first control. Results. Control after seven days showed a statistically significant decrease of symptoms. In 385 women, <b>vaginal</b> <b>smear</b> was found negative to yeast and yeast blastospores. Within the first seven days after treatment 84 women had to repeat therapy due to the persistence of symptoms or positive <b>vaginal</b> <b>smear.</b> After 28 days we recorded full recovery in 392 patients, clinical improvement in eight, no change in 16, and deterioration in one patient only. Side effects were very seldom, mostly in the form of a slight redness of the vulva and vagina, and mild itching during several days. Conclusion. Our observations confirmed good efficacy and safety of fenticonazole in the treatment of vaginal candidiasis...|$|R
