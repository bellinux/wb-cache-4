40|$|Abstract. <b>Video-endoscopy</b> (Figure 1), {{a mode of}} {{minimally}} invasive surgery, {{has proven to be}} significantly less invasive to the patient. However, it creates a much more complex operation environment that requires the surgeon to operate through a video interface. Visual feedback control and image interpretation can be difficult. Poor visual feedback in <b>video-endoscopy</b> prolongs the operation time, increases the risk to the patient, and drives up the cost of health care. It is a major roadblock in replacing the traditional, highly traumatic open surgical procedures with the much less invasive, more patient friendly <b>video-endoscopy,</b> and in training the surgeons to master this new mode of operation. Our research objective is thus to design, code, and validate on real images novel image analysis and rectification algorithms to enhance the visual feedback to the surgeon in <b>video-endoscopy.</b> Index terms: computer-assisted medicine, eight-point algorithm, endoscopy, feature tracking I...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} extent of {{interobserver}} variability in the nomenclature of benign laryngeal pathology based on evaluation of <b>video-endoscopies</b> with and without stroboscopy. DESIGN: Eight video clips of benign laryngeal conditions were viewed by 35 non-voice specialist ENT surgeons. The surgeons viewed the clips in groups of varying sizes with no discussion between them {{and were asked to}} make only one diagnosis for each lesion. SETTING: Specialist voice clinic in the department of ENT at The Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Participating ENT surgeons were all either registrars or consultants working at different centres in UK, recruited by the author. None were voice specialists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Interobserver agreement was measured using kappa statistics. RESULTS: Variation was widespread with only two of the eight cases (25 %) showing agreement of over 75 %. Agreement could be analysed statistically as moderate at best (kappa= 0. 5 with a 95 % confidence interval from 0. 5 to 0. 6). The seniority of the laryngologist was also analysed with consultants and senior trainees (specialist registrar years 4 - 6) having better agreement than junior trainees (specialist registrar years 1 - 3). CONCLUSIONS: The generally accepted optimum treatment for different benign laryngeal pathologies varies substantially. However, our results shows a significant high-level interobserver variability in their diagnosis by non-voice specialists, thus reducing the reliability of outcome data and treatment recommendations. It is therefore important to try and lower this interobserver variability, possibly by widespread use of improved diagnostic technology, stricter/more universally accepted definitions and supervised training of junior doctors in a voice clinic environmen...|$|R

40|$|Copyright Â© 2008 The American Laryngological, Rhinological & Otological Society, Inc. BACKGROUND: Bleeding is a {{major concern}} in {{endoscopic}} sinus surgery (ESS), as it may impede surgical progress and is often associated with complications. To improve the study and management of intraoperative bleeding, a standardized method of recording bleeding during ESS is needed. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a standardized method of documenting bleeding in ESS and of grading the surgical field. METHODS: Bleeding after endoscopic sinus surgery was recorded using <b>video-endoscopy.</b> Standardized and non-standardized video-endoscopies of 20 patients were graded using a previously published grading scale (the Boezaart scale) in randomized order on two different occasions. Effects of standardization on intra- and interrater reliability were evaluated. Based on this experience, a new 11 -point surgical field grading scale was developed and simultaneously compared with the six-point Boezaart scale via means of a DVD in three international centers. RESULTS: Inter and intrarater reliability of the Boezaart and new Wormald scales significantly improved by employing a standardized <b>video-endoscopy</b> technique. The Wormald scale had significantly higher interrater (0. 80 vs. 0. 74, P <. 001) and intrarater (0. 89 vs. 0. 83, P <. 001) reliability than the Boezaart scale. Linear regression analysis revealed the Wormald scale to be more sensitive to changes in the most common surgical fields experienced in ESS. CONCLUSION: Standardized <b>video-endoscopy</b> has been demonstrated to significantly improve reliability and reproducibility of results and is recommended for future work evaluating bleeding in ESS. The new Wormald grading scale has been shown to be an inexpensive, reliable, and sensitive tool to rapidly evaluate intraoperative bleeding in ESS. It overcomes several limitations of the Boezaart scale, enabling us to analyze currently employed and newly developed hemostatic methods and agents...|$|E

It rarely reaches the mucous membrane, and the nasal fossa involvement is exceptional. Case reportA 68 -year-old woman presented with an ulcerous hemorrhagic mass blocking the left nasal fossa, which had appeared {{a few weeks after}} a wasp sting in the nose. The insect was evacuated only three weeks after the sting. The clinical and radiological data suggested malignancy. Biopsy under local anesthesia proved non-contributory and was complicated by 1 week's hospitalization for severe nosebleed. Surgical excision under <b>video-endoscopy</b> confirmed diagnosis. At 31 monthsâ follow-up, the patient was free of recurrence. Discussion/conclusionThe pathogeny of lobular capillary hemangioma is uncertain. No previous cases affecting the mucous membrane after insect sting have been reported. Except in the typical contexts of long-term packing or pregnancy, diagnosis can be difficult and misleading. It can mimic a malignant pathology. Its rich vascularization requires caution during biopsy, and the risk of recurrence requires excision to be complete...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the prevalence of sub-clinical diseases in poorly-performing Standardbred horses, compare their physiological response to exercise with control horses, and identify predictive parameters of poor-performance. Fifty horses underwent thorough clinical and ancillary examinations, including haematological and biochemical evaluation, Doppler echocardiography, standardised exercise tests (SETs) on both treadmill and racetrack, treadmill <b>video-endoscopy</b> and collection of respiratory fluids. Most of the poorly-performing horses exhibited many concomitant diseases. The most frequently diagnosed problems involved the lower and upper respiratory tract and the musculoskeletal system. Poor-performers had lower speeds at a blood lactate (LA) concentration of 4 mmol/L (VLA 4) and a heart rate (HR) of 200 bpm (V 200) on treadmill and racetrack, as well as lower values for haematological parameters, plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme and antioxidants, compared to control horses.

40|$|Introduction: The crista galli {{is part of}} the ethmoid {{bone and}} thus may suffer from the process of pneumatization. Pneumatization occurs in between 3 % and 14 % of patients, {{resulting}} from air cells in the frontal or ethmoid sinuses. Aim: To describe 3 cases of crista galli pneumatization in which the patients developed infection and were treated surgically by endoscopic techniques. Method: We present 3 case studies of patients complaining of severe frontal headaches. The patients underwent ENT evaluation, examination by <b>video-endoscopy,</b> and computed tomography, which identified crista galli pneumatization with mucosal thickening and the presence of fluid. Patients underwent treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids; however, they showed no symptomatic improvement, displayed recurrence of symptoms, and maintained radiographic changes. Thus, patients then underwent drainage through the crista galli via an endoscopic procedure. Discussion: During surgery, mucopurulence and/or mucosal thickening and edema were identified in the pneumatized crista galli. There were no complications during or after surgery. Postoperatively, headache was improved in patients after a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Conclusion: Crista galli pneumatization can result in infection, simulating rhinosinusitis.

40|$|The in vivo {{response}} of adult northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria, to Aureococcus anophagefferens (brown tide) {{at the level}} of the gill was determined using <b>video-endoscopy.</b> Feeding activity, particle-approach velocities, and ventral-groove-transport velocities were documented after the quahogs were exposed to Isochryis galbana (baseline observations) supplemented with either toxic or nontoxic A. anophagefferens at two bloom concentrations (8 7 105 or 2 7 106 cells ml- 1). Externally, there was no evidence of adverse effects of brown tide on feeding, as siphons remained extended and dilated. Toxic brown tide at both concentrations elicited gill muscular contractions, intermittent cessation of water flow, and decreased particle loading within the pallial cavity. The 8 7 105 cell ml- 1 toxic treatment had no significant effect on approach velocities or ventral-groove-transport velocities after 2 h, although timeaveraging showed significant reduction of the latter during the last 30 min of exposure. The higher concentration of toxic brown tide caused a significant decrease in these velocities after only 1 h. Nontoxic brown tide produced none of these effects. Thus, A. anophagefferens compromised quahog feeding by stimulating contractions of the branchial musculature and interfering with lateral and ventral groove ciliary beating. These effects were both timeand concentration-dependent and could be caused by either a dopaminergic or a serotonergic toxic factor. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|More than 20 {{years have}} passed since the {{introduction}} of surgical techniques based on distal myocutaneous flaps or micro-vascular flaps in the reconstruction after head and neck cancer resections. The experience gained from the beginning of these techniques until today, has improved the possibility to better predict functional impairment of swallowing in patients and its possible recovery. This contributes to a better counselling of the patient and better prediction concerning his/her quality of life. Despite the time passed and good progress in the development of microsurgical techniques, the literature shows that many differences still remain among Authors concerning choice of flap and its inset in relation to the anatomical sites and the extent of resection. Many other variables may condition post-operative swallowing (pre- or post-operative radiotherapy, general conditions of the patient â¦) thus contributing to a more difficult comparison of the different series reported in the literature.

40|$|Oysters {{accumulate}} {{relatively low}} levels of domoic acid (DA) compared to other bivalves. Mafra et al. (2009, in this Theme Section) identified feeding mechanisms of oysters {{that may lead to}} low DA accumulation during monospecific blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries. However, several different species of Pseudo-nitzschia, as well as other diatoms and flagellates, may co-occur during a bloom. Therefore, the present study investigates pre-ingestive feeding processes that operate when oysters Crassostrea virginica are exposed to mixed phytoplankton assemblages containing P. multiseries of varying cell length. Guided by <b>video-endoscopy,</b> material transported along the ventral and dorsal gill tracts was sampled and analyzed to determine the site for sorting of microalgae on the pallial organs. There was no preferential rejection of P. multiseries in pseudofeces when oysters were exposed to the alga in a mixed suspension with other diatom species (Thalassiosira weissflogii or Chaetoceros muelleri). In contrast, P. multiseries was preferentially rejected when mixed with the flagellates Isochrysis galbana or Rhodomonas lens, suggesting a qualitative mechanism for particle sorting. This occurred on the gills, followed by further selection on the palps. Oysters also preferentially rejected larger P. multiseries cells (82 to 90 5 m) relative to smaller ones (24 to 28 5 m) on the gills, while no further selection based on size occurred on the palps. This effect is attributed to the fact that P. multiseries cells with a length that exceeds the width of the principal filament aperture (ca. 68 5 m) are more likely directed to the ventral tract and rejected in pseudofeces. These findings offer an additional explanation for the relatively low DA levels found in oysters during natural Pseudo-nitzschia spp. blooms. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|Dysphonia is {{a common}} {{paediatric}} condition. Adult voices are usually evaluated using a set of minimal basic measurements including: endoscopic examination, aerodynamics, perception, acoustics, and self-assessment by the patient. The Voice Handicap Index is {{the most widely used}} self-assessment tool, but its use in the paediatric setting has never been reported. Aim {{of this study was to}} report Voice Handicap Index ratings in a group of dysphonic children, multi-modally assessed before and after voice therapy. The study involved 28 children (16 female, 12 male, mean age 10. 9 years (range 6 - 12)) presenting chronic hoarseness due to vocal fold nodules (18 cases), unilateral localised oedema (6 cases) or recurrent laryngeal paralysis (4 cases). All received voice therapy for 5 - 6 months, and underwent voice assessments based on <b>video-endoscopy</b> ratings (size of nodule/oedema or glottic closure in the case of recurrent laryngeal paralysis), maximum phonation time, GIRBAS scale, spectrograms and a perturbation analysis. All patients also completed the Voice Handicap Index. Aerodynamic, acoustic, perceptual and self-assessment data, before and after voice therapy, were compared using Wilcoxonâs test and Studentâs t test. Correlations between the Voice Handicap Index domains were measured by means of Pearsonâs correlation coefficient. Post-treatment measurements showed that the nodules/oedema had decreased in size in 18 children following therapy, and two subjects with recurrent laryngeal paralysis showed improved glottic closure. Mean maximum phonation time increased slightly, but the difference was not significant. There was a general reduction in perceptual severity, but this was only significant for parameters G, B and A. Spectrographic analysis showed no significant improvement and, although the mean perturbation analysis values improved, only the difference in jitter values was significant (p = 0. 016). Voice Handicap Index was applicable in all cases, and showed a clear and significant improvement (p = 0. 0006).

40|$|The {{incidence}} of reflux associated diseases {{in the western}} countries has been rising continiously {{over the past years}} according to current publications. Among these diseases are the gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), the herein rooting clinical pattern of Barrett metaplasia as well as the reflux associated adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus. Many of the studies conducted within the field of Barrettâs esophagus and the precancerotic potential and the respective guidelines have been developed on data gathered almost solely in the hospital sector. Possible differences in procedure and execution of endoscopy among Barrett patients have not yet been sufficiently analyzed. Therefor the aim of this dissertation was to compare the sector of the community practices and the hospital sector as to procedures, quality and documentation of examination of patients with Barrettâs esophagus. Particular interest was given to the question whether these parameters influence the detection rate of neoplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma. A retrospective data analysis was conducted that included all patients with histologically proven Barrettâs esophagus (BE) in a time frame of 3 years in 6 hospitals and 19 gastroenterological community practices. The volume of the studied endoscopies equaled about one third of the total of endoscopies of the upper gastrointestinal tract in both sectors in Berlin (n= 126. 000). We were able to primarily include 1317 case histories of patients with diagnosed Barrettâs esophagus. Of these 66 % were seen in the community practice. We were able to demonstrate that patients seen in the community practice showed shorter BE segments (2, 6 cm vs 3, 8 cm; p< 0, 001). In the same sector there were also significantly less biopsies taken per 2 cm BE segment (2, 5 vs 4, 1 per 2 cm BE segment; p< 0, 001). Lacking documentation was to be found in 74, 9 % within the community practice and in 42, 2 % of the cases within the hospital sector (p< 0, 001). Initially neoplasia was detected more often in the hospital setting, with 9, 2 % of neoplastic altered barrett esophagus versus 0, 7 % in the community practice (CP) setting (p< 0, 001). After taking the referrals from the CP to the hospitals into account and cases with endoscopy due to other reasons, there was only a non-significant difference in the neoplasia detection rate of 1, 3 %. Overall only 13 % of the cases with neoplasia were diagnosed during endoscopic surveillance programs in patients with known barrettâs esophagus. On the other hand 57 % of those detected neoplasias were in a very early stage. We therefore conclude that the main reason for the higher neoplastic prevalence in the hospital sector is probably due to referral bias and not necessarily to a better adherence to guidelines. Even though we could show that the diagnostic lacked according to the common guidelines especially in the community practices, most of the neoplasias were at an early and therefore potentially curable stage at time of detection. According to our analysis a revision of the current guidelines towards a greater focus on the importance high definition <b>video-endoscopy</b> seems to be reasonable. Future studies dealing with the differences found in our analysis are to be recommended in order to adapt current guidelines...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is {{at present}} the gold {{standard}} therapeutic modality for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) resistant to medical therapy. Whilst results from ESS for CRS are generally good, postoperative bleeding and impaired wound healing with adhesion formation remains a concern. Due to patient discomfort and the detrimental effects on wound healing caused by most packing materials, many surgeons no longer routinely use nasal packing. Surgeons {{have in the past}} sought agents which would provide post-operative haemostasis without detrimentally affecting wound healing. Antifibrinolytics have been available for many years, however, their topical application has only been explored in the last few years. Recently different forms of chitosan have separately shown significant promise as powerful haemostatic and anti-adhesion agents. The aim of this thesis was to explore the progressive understanding of the interaction between haemostasis and wound healing with possible development of a novel agent. Methods: The first step to scientifically assess bleeding after sinus surgery was to develop a standardised method of video endoscopy and grading the surgical field during ESS. This was done as a multinational collaborative trial. Once this assessment tool was validated a randomised controlled trial evaluating the effect of two antifibrinolytics (epsilon aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid) was conducted. Further evaluation was then conducted on other possible hemostatic and antiadhesion substances. This included various combinations of a novel chitosan gel. These gels were trialled in vitro to determine their effect on human nasal fibroblasts derived from CRS patients. Fibroblast adhesion and proliferation as well as closure of standardised wounds were studied. The most promising of these gels was then used in an in vivo sheep model. Once effectiveness of the chitosan-dextran gel was shown in the laboratory, this was evaluated against a number of currently available hemostatic and anti-adhesion substances in a standardised model of wound healing in sheep with CRS. This model had been previously extensively validated in our department. Full thickness mucosal injuries were created on the lateral nasal wall and ethmoids of twenty sheep and recombinant tissue factor (rTF), SprayGel or Chitosan-Dextran derivative gel applied topically in a randomized fashion. Adhesion formation and severity as well as microscopic wound healing and ciliary function were analysed at day 28, 56, 84 and 112 post initial surgery. A further sheep study was conducted applying chitosan dextran gel to standardised mucosal injuries and comparing its effect on the control of bleeding to control. Bleeding time and grade were recorded and wound healing monitored via serial videoendoscopy over two weeks and objectively measured. Results: a) Assessment of the bleeding scales showed that inter and intra observer reliability for both scales tested were significantly improved by employing a standardized <b>video-endoscopy</b> technique. The Wormald scale proved to be more reliable and sensitive to changes in the most common surgical fields encountered in ESS. b) Tranexamic acid showed a modest but clinically significant improvement in the surgical field at 2, 4 and 6 minutes after application. Epsilon aminocaproic acid did not effectively improve the surgical field. c) Nasal fibroblast adhesion and proliferation were significantly impaired with dextran and chitosan. The most effective ratio that delayed but did not prevent wound closure were 5 % chitosan: 5 % dextran gel. d) In a standardised sheep model of mucosal wound healing the chitosan gel significantly decreased lateral nasal wall and ethmoidal adhesions at all time points. The chitosan group had a significantly greater percentage of re-epithelialisation and reciliation than control and rTF. In addition the mean cilial grade in the chitosan group was significantly better than control. e) The chitosan dextran gel was significantly more haemostatic at 2, 4, and 6 minutes after injury with no significant difference noted in wound healing. Conclusions: Standardised methods of videoendoscopy and grading the surgical field in ESS are valuable tools for further research. Tranexamic acid significantly improved the surgical field to a moderate degree in ESS compared to control. Chitosan gel is a promising new powerful haemostatic bio-polymer which has a mild inhibitory effect on fibroblast attachment and proliferation. This may partially explain the significant improvement in microscopic wound healing and reduction in adhesion formation seen in a sheep model of chronic sinusitis. Future work evaluating this gel in the setting of a human trial is currently underway. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Medicine, 200...|$|E
