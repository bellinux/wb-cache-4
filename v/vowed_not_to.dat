5|$|Ba Cụt was {{publicly}} guillotined on 13 July 1956, in Cần Thơ. His {{body was}} later diced into small pieces, {{which were then}} buried separately. Some followers, led by a deputy named Bảy Đớm, retreated to a small area beside the Cambodian border, where they <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> rest until Ba Cụt was avenged. Many of his followers later joined the Việt Cộng—the movement that succeeded the Việt Minh their leader had fought—and took up arms against Diệm.|$|E
5|$|On July 25 The New York Times {{reported}} that a general strike {{had taken place in}} Scranton. A committee representing the miners called a meeting with W. R. Storrs, coal superintendent. They demanded higher wages, and <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> return to work, even if the railroad workers abandoned their strike. The brakemen, firemen and others joined, and every industry in the city was halted {{with the exception of the}} Pennsylvania Coal Company.|$|E
5|$|In the 1854 elections, Lincoln {{was elected}} to the Illinois {{legislature}} but declined to take his seat. In the aftermath of the elections, which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Lincoln instead sought election to the United States Senate. At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature. After leading in the first six rounds of voting, but unable to obtain a majority, Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull. Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> support any Whig. Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, Joel Aldrich Matteson.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{reaching}} to Gujarat, Swaminarayan by His preaching and super natural divine power restored noted notorious criminals as normal civilians. These criminals left their evil nature and started living life with high moral values {{to the extent}} that they would never rob, or kill any living being. Even they would not see the unknown women or would not drink alcohol and be strict vegetarian. Bombay Governor Sir Malcolm was impressed by social reforms of Swaminarayan and so had come down to Rajkot to meet Swaminarayan personally and to appreciate His work towards educating high moral values to the people of Gujarat and helping British Government in reducing criminal graph of Gujarat. Swaminarayan had <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> kill the evil people but to kill their evil nature.|$|E
5|$|When the Geneva Conference in July 1954 {{ended the}} First Indochina War, it handed North Vietnam to Hồ Chí Minh's Việt Minh, {{and the south}} to the State of Vietnam. To reunify the country, {{national}} elections were scheduled for 1956, following which the French would withdraw from Indochina. The partition of Vietnam angered Ba Cụt and he <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> cut his hair until the nation was reunified. Having fought against the Việt Minh since 1947, Ba Cụt's principal criticism of Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm's State of Vietnam government stemmed from his belief that Diệm had been too passive in rejecting the partition, and {{that half of the}} country should not have been yielded to the communists.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ivan Vladislav {{consolidated}} {{his positions}} {{in the mountains of}} Albania and Macedonia. As early as October 1015 he began the reconstruction of many strongholds destroyed during the war, including the fortress at Bitola (as testified in the Bitola inscription). In 1016 he invited his vassal Prince Jovan Vladimir of Doclea, who was married to Gabriel Radomir's sister Theodora Kosara, to come to his court. The emperor probably desired to seize the prince and so secure his western flank. The Prince was determined to attend the invitation of Tsar, but his wife Theodora Kosara did not trust the murderer of her brother, and fearing for her husband's life persuaded him not to go. Ivan Vladislav however <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> threaten his vassal's life, and sent him a golden cross as a proof of good will. Jovan Vladimir still hesitated, saying that God was nailed to a wooden not golden cross, but Ivan Vladislav repeated his vow and gave him a guarantee of safe-conduct, also guaranteed by the Bulgarian patriarch David. Eventually Jovan Vladimir travelled to the court of the Tsar in Prespa, but upon his arrival on 22 May, he was immediately beheaded, and the emperor refused to allow the burial of his body. It was not until a number of miraculous events related to the corpse of the prince were observed that Vladislav returned the body to Kosara.|$|E

25|$|Casals was {{an ardent}} {{supporter}} of the Spanish Republican government, and after its defeat <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> return to Spain until democracy was restored.

25|$|When he was 17 years old, {{he heard}} that the {{relatives}} of an unfortunate girl who had strayed from her course killed the girl by poisoning her. On enquiry, he came {{know that it was}} not uncommon to kill girls in such a manner in kulin (orthodox upper caste) Brahmin families. He was so shocked that he <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> go in for polygamous marriage, a system in vogue in orthodox upper caste society in those days.|$|E

25|$|Douglas Jung {{joined the}} Progressive Conservative Party {{in the early}} 1950s. He had <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> join the Liberal Party of Canada because of its racist {{legislation}} against Chinese in the past. Jung was elected as an MP in 1957, representing the riding of Vancouver Centre, under the John Diefenbaker government. In his maiden speech in the House of Commons, he urged Canada to take {{a leading role in}} serving as a bridge to the Pacific Rim countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{assassination}} triggered major {{suppression of}} civil liberties in Russia, and police brutality burst back in full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II, whose death was witnessed first-hand by his son, Alexander III, and his grandson, Nicholas II, both future emperors who <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have the same fate befall them. Both of them used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people. A series of anti-Jewish pogroms and antisemitic legislation, the May Laws, were yet another result.|$|E
25|$|In 1999 Jeremy Gilley desired {{there be}} one single day when all {{countries}} <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> wage war: a worldwide ceasefire and day of non-violence. He established Peace One Day. The UN had already declared the third Tuesday of September the International Day of Peace, Peace One Day aimed {{to resolve the}} confusion on which calendar day it fell, and on 7 September 2001, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution formally establishing the UN International Day of Peace an annual Peace Day of global ceasefire and non-violence on 21 September.|$|E
30|$|Beyond {{salaries}} and bonuses, physicians earn significant additional compensation from informal payments by patients, typically {{in the form}} of a red envelope (hóng bāo) containing cash. A regulation proposed by the Ministry of Health in August 2012 would require doctors and patients to sign an agreement in which the doctor <b>vows</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> ask for money and the patient <b>vows</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> try to hand over an envelope (Qingyun 2012). Since hóng bāo is transferred in private and the practice is deeply engrained in a Chinese gift culture that fosters relational ties, it is unlikely that the rule by itself will change the practice.|$|R

25|$|Naomie Harris was {{initially}} reluctant to portray Paula, stating {{that she did}} not want to play a stereotypical depiction of a black woman. When addressing her concerns, Jenkins emphasized the character’s representation of both his and McCraney's mothers. Harris later commented that although she had previously <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> portray a crack addict, the film's script and director's tolerance appealed to her. In preparation for her role, Harris watched interviews of those with addiction to crack cocaine, and met with addicted women. She related her experiences of bullying to the addicts' attempts of escaping trauma.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} twenty, Luckner {{entered a}} German {{navigation}} training school, where he passed the examinations for his mate's ticket. By 1908 he had joined the Hamburg-Südamerikanische Line steamer Petropolis, intending to serve for nine months before volunteering {{to serve in the}} Imperial German Navy for a year, to obtain a naval commission. He had <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> return to his family except in uniform and was eventually welcomed back by his family, who had given him up for lost. In February 1912 Luckner was finally called up by the Navy and served on the gunboat SMS Panther.|$|E
25|$|Campaigners, {{many from}} the city’s Afro-Caribbean community, {{have called for}} the hall’s name to be changed because of Edward Colston’s link to the slave trade, much of his wealth having come from that trade, and his {{investments}} in the Royal African Company. The Bristol group Massive Attack <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> play at the venue while it retained its present name. The proposal sparked a heated controversy {{in the pages of}} the local press, although the majority of letters printed favoured retaining the Colston name. In April 2017, the charity that runs Colston Hall announced that it would be dropping the name after refurbishment is completed in 2020.|$|E

25|$|The {{struggle}} for independence from the British soon took roots in the city. In 1915, Mahatma Gandhi came from South Africa and established two ashrams in the city, the Kochrab Ashram near Paldi in 1915 and the Satyagraha Ashram {{on the banks of}} Sabarmati in 1917. The latter was later called Harijan Ashram or Sabarmati Ashram. He started the salt satyagraha in 1930. He and many followers marched from his ashram to the coastal village of Dandi, Gujarat, to protest against the British imposing a tax on salt. Before he left the ashram, he <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> return to the ashram until India became independent.|$|E
25|$|Mama Maghan, mansa of Kangaba, campaigned {{against the}} Bamana in 1667 and laid siege to Segou-Koro for a {{reported}} three years. Segou, defended by Biton Coulibaly, successfully defended itself and Mama Maghan {{was forced to}} withdraw. Either as a counter-attack or simply the progression of pre-planned assaults against the remnants of Mali, the Bamana sacked and burned Niani in 1670. Their forces marched {{as far north as}} Kangaba, where the mansa was obliged to make a peace with them, promising not to attack downstream of Mali. The Bamana, likewise, <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> advance farther upstream than Niamina. Following this disastrous set of events, Mansa Mama Maghan abandoned the capital of Niani.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of that year, someone stole a master tape of a rough draft of the album from one of Gaye's {{traveling}} musicians, Frank Blair, taking the master tape to Motown's Hollywood headquarters. Motown remixed the album and released it on January 15, 1981. When Gaye learned of its release, he accused Motown of editing and remixing the album without his consent, allowing the release of an unfinished production (Far Cry), altering the album art of his request and removing the album title's question mark, muting its irony. He also accused the label of rush-releasing the album, comparing his unfinished album to an unfinished Picasso painting. Gaye then <b>vowed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> record any more music for Motown.|$|E
