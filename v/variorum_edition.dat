Manuscripts of the Sheiltot, but with essential divergences from the printed text, are to be found among the Hebrew manuscripts in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, Nos. 308, 309, and in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, Nos. 539, 540, 1317.

2500|$|The {{question}} of the sexual orientation of the sonnets' author was openly articulated in 1780, when George Steevens, upon reading Shakespeare's description {{of a young man}} as his [...] "master-mistress" [...] remarked, [...] "it is impossible to read this fulsome panegyrick, addressed to a male object, without an equal mixture of disgust and indignation". Other English scholars, dismayed at the possibility that their national hero might have been a [...] "sodomite", concurred with Samuel Taylor Coleridge's comment, around 1800, that Shakespeare's love was [...] "pure" [...] and in his sonnets there is [...] "not even an allusion to that very worst of all possible vices". Robert Browning, writing of Wordsworth's assertion that [...] "with this key [...] Shakespeare unlocked his heart", famously replied in his poem House, [...] "If so, the less Shakespeare he!" [...] The controversy continued in the 20th Century. By 1944, the <b>Variorum</b> <b>edition</b> of the sonnets contained an appendix with the conflicting views of nearly forty commentators. In the year after [...] "the law in Britain decriminalized homosexual acts between consenting males over twenty-one", the historian G. P. V. Akrigg published the first extended study of the Earl of Southampton, [...] "who he had no doubt was the 'fair youth' of the sonnets." [...] Akrigg wrote, [...] "One is forced to suspect that some element of homosexuality lay {{at the root of the}} trouble [...] [...] [...] The love which he felt for Southampton may well have been the most intense emotion of his life." ...|$|E

The book of Job {{is usually}} {{regarded}} as the most poetical work in the Bible, even exceeding Psalms and Isaiah in its splendid imaginative language and extraordinary figures of speech. For a literary study of it, the student is recommended to Professor Moulton's edition. Omar Khayyam was a Persian poet of mediaeval times, who became known to English readers through the beautiful paraphrase {{of some of his}} stanzas by Edward Fitzgerald, in 1859. If any one will take the trouble to compare a literal prose rendering of Omar (as in N.H.

Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881) was perhaps the foremost writer of English prose in the nineteenth century. Although a consummate literary artist, he was even more influential as a moral tonic. His philosophy and that of Omar represent as wide a contrast as could easily be found. Walt Whitman, the strange American poet (1819-1892), whose famous Leaves of Grass (1855) excited an uproar in America, and gave the author a much more serious reputation in Europe. Stevenson's interest in him was genuine, but not partisan, and his essay, The Gospel According to Walt Whitman (The New Quarterly Magazine, Oct. 1878), is perhaps the most judicious appreciation in the English language of this singular poet. Job, Omar Khayyam, Carlyle and Whitman, taken together, certainly give a curious collection of what the Germans call Weltanschauungen.] ...|$|E
6000|$|Six {{years later}} {{appeared}} a <b>variorum</b> <b>edition</b> in {{which for the}} first time Shelley's text was edited with scientific exactness of method, and with a due respect for the authority of the original editions. It would be difficult indeed to over-estimate the gains which have accrued to the lovers of Shelley from the strenuous labours of Mr. Harry Buxton Forman, C.B. He too has enlarged the body of Shelley's poetry (Mr. Forman's most notable addition is the second part of [...] "The Daemon of the World", which he printed privately in 1876, and included in his Library Edition of the [...] "Poetical Works" [...] published in the same year. See the [...] "List of Editions", etc. at the end of Volume 3.); but, important as his editions undoubtedly are, it may safely be affirmed that his services in this direction constitute the least part of what we owe him. He has vindicated the authenticity of the text in many places, while in many others he has succeeded, with the aid of manuscripts, in restoring it. His untiring industry in research, his wide bibliographical knowledge and experience, above all, his accuracy, as invariable as it is minute, have combined to make him, in the words of Professor Dowden, 'our chief living authority on all that relates to Shelley's writings.' His name stands securely linked for all time to Shelley's by a long series of notable words, including three successive editions (1876, 1882, 1892) of the Poems, an edition of the Prose Remains, as well as many minor publications--a Bibliography ("The Shelley Library", 1886)and several Facsimile Reprints of the early issues, edited for the Shelley Society.|$|E
50|$|An older {{meaning of}} the word refers not to the text itself but to the {{assortment}} of illustrative notes printed with it: 'an edition of a text (usually Latin or Greek) which includes annotations by a variety of critics and commentators'. <b>Variorum</b> <b>editions</b> of this kind were a speciality of Dutch publishers of the 17th century, including the house of Elsevier. In these editions the text is usually taken, with little or no attempt at constructive modification, from a single widely accepted critical edition of the period; the interest lies in the notes, which often fill three-quarters of each page, and which typically embody the complete commentaries of two or three recognised specialists {{in the work of the}} author in question, together with selected passages from several other commentators. The notes will usually include textual variants, both documented and conjectural, together with examples of parallel usages and (for non-fiction texts) historical information. Usually some middle-ranking literary man was appointed as general editor; occasionally, however, a first-rate scholar would preside over the edition and include original work of his own within it, Nicolas Heinsius's edition of Claudian (Elsevier, 1661) being a good example.|$|R
40|$|The {{perennial}} {{debate about}} the inspiration and authority of the Bible is a strong, though indirect, evidence of {{the uniqueness of the}} book. Other writings have been studied with the most minute care—witness, for example, the <b>Variorum</b> <b>Editions</b> of Shakespeare, although even such close study of the greatest of English authors can hardly compare with the microscopic scrutiny to which Scripture has been subjected by scholars of all shades of theological conviction. As Karl Barth has said of his own work, {{when it comes to the}} writing of his commentaries, such as the Römerbrief, he has to take every word of the Bible seriously. And so also all responsible scholars, whether liberal or orthodox, must take every word seriously if they are to deal fairly with Scripture. Not only has the Bible been more closely studied than any other book; it has also been the subject of a kind of inquiry quite different from that directed toward other works of literature. It is important to establish the most reliable text of the classics like Plato and Aristotle. But no one asks about Plato or Aristotle, Dante, Shakespeare, Goethe, or any other great writer the questions that are persistently asked about the origin and authority of the Bible. The plain truth is that the Bible is studied in a way and for a purpose that puts it in a class by itself...|$|R

6000|$|This {{edition of}} his [...] "Poetical Works" [...] {{contains}} all Shelley's ascertained poems and fragments of verse that have hitherto appeared in print. In preparing the volume I have worked {{as far as possible}} on the principle of recognizing the editio princeps as the primary textual authority. I have not been content to reprint Mrs. Shelley's recension of 1839, or that of any subsequent editor of the [...] "Poems". The present text {{is the result of a}} fresh collation of the early editions; and in every material instance of departure from the wording of those originals the rejected reading has been subjoined in a footnote. Again, wherever--as in the case of [...] "Julian and Maddalo"--there has appeared to be good reason for superseding the authority of the editio princeps, the fact is announced, and the substituted exemplar indicated, in the Prefatory Note. in the case of a few pieces extant in two or more versions of debatable authority the alternative text or texts will be found at the [end] of the [relevant work]; but it may be said once for all that this does not pretend to be a <b>variorum</b> <b>edition,</b> in the proper sense of the term--the textual apparatus does not claim to be exhaustive. Thus I have not thought it necessary to cumber the footnotes with every minute grammatical correction introduced by Mrs. Shelley, apparently on her own authority, into the texts of 1839; nor has it come within the scheme of this edition to record every conjectural emendation adopted or proposed by Rossetti and others in recent times. But it is hoped that, up to and including the editions of 1839 at least, no important variation of the text has been overlooked. Whenever a reading has been adopted on manuscript authority, a reference to the particular source has been added below.|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, however {{strong a}} {{case may be}} made out against the Folio of 1623, {{whatever}} sins of omission we may lay {{to the charge of}} Heminge and Condell, or of commission to that of the printers, it remains the only text we have with any claims whatever to authenticity. It should be deferred to as authority in all cases where it does not make Shakespeare write bad sense, uncouth metre, or false grammar, of all which we believe him to have been more supremely incapable than any other man who ever wrote English. Yet we would not speak unkindly even of the blunders of the Folio. They have put bread into the mouth of many an honest editor, publisher, and printer for the last century and a half; and he who loves the comic side of human nature will find the serious notes of a <b>variorum</b> <b>edition</b> of Shakespeare as funny reading as the funny ones are serious. Scarce a commentator of them all, for more than a hundred years, but thought, as Alphonso of Castile did of Creation, that, if he had only been at Shakespeare's elbow, he could have given valuable advice; scarce one who did not know off-hand that there was never a seaport in Bohemia,--as if Shakespeare's world were one which Mercator could have projected; scarce one but was satisfied that his ten finger-tips were a sufficient key to those astronomic wonders of poise and counterpoise, of planetary law and cometary seeming-exception, in his metres; scarce one but thought he could gauge like an ale-firkin that intuition whose edging shallows may have been sounded, but whose abysses, stretching down amid the sunless roots of Being and Consciousness, mock the plummet; scarce one but could speak with condescending approval of that prodigious intelligence so utterly without congener that our baffled language must coin an adjective to qualify it, and none is so audacious as to say Shakesperian of any other. And yet, in the midst of our impatience, we cannot help thinking also of how much healthy mental activity this one man has been the occasion, how much good he has indirectly done to society by withdrawing men to investigations and habits of thought that secluded them from baser attractions, for how many he has enlarged the circle of study and reflection; since there is nothing in history or politics, nothing in art or science, nothing in physics or metaphysics, that is not sooner or later taxed for his illustration. This is partially true of all great minds, open and sensitive to truth and beauty through any large arc of their circumference; but it is true in an unexampled sense of Shakespeare, the vast round of whose balanced nature seems to have been equatorial, and to have had a southward exposure and a summer sympathy at every point, so that life, society, statecraft, serve us at last but as commentaries on him, and whatever we have gathered of thought, of knowledge, and of experience, confronted with his marvellous page, shrinks to a mere foot-note, the stepping-stone to some hitherto inaccessible verse. We admire in Homer the blind placid mirror of the world's young manhood, the bard who escapes from his misfortune in poems all memory, all life and bustle, adventure and picture; we revere in Dante that compressed force of lifelong passion which could make a private experience cosmopolitan in its reach and everlasting in its significance; we respect in Goethe the Aristotelian poet, wise by weariless observation, witty with intention, the stately Geheimerrath of a provincial court in the empire of Nature. As we study these, we seem in our limited way to penetrate into their consciousness and to measure and master their methods; but with Shakespeare it is just the other way; the more we have familiarized ourselves with the operations of our own consciousness, the more do we find, in reading him, that he has been beforehand with us, and that, while we have been vainly endeavoring to find the door of his being, he has searched every nook and cranny of our own. While other poets and dramatists embody isolated phases of character and work inward from the phenomenon to the special law which it illustrates, he seems in some strange way unitary with human nature itself, and his own soul to have been the law and life-giving power of which his creations are only the phenomena. We justify or criticise the characters of other writers by our memory and experience, and pronounce them natural or unnatural; but he seems to have worked in the very stuff of which memory and experience are made, and we recognize his truth to Nature by an innate and unacquired sympathy, as if he alone possessed the secret of the [...] "ideal form and universal mould," [...] and embodied generic types rather than individuals. In this Cervantes alone has approached him; and Don Quixote and Sancho, like {{the men and women of}} Shakespeare, are the contemporaries of every generation, because they are not products of an artificial and transitory society, but because they are animated by the primeval and unchanging forces of that humanity which underlies and survives the forever-fickle creeds and ceremonials of the parochial corners which we who dwell in them sublimely call The World.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} address the problems arising from the complicated textual history of C. S. Lewis’s novel That Hideous Strength, and the sophisticated, often misunderstood, nature of the web of allusion, sources and influences on which the novel depends. One of the duties of an editor is to mediate between the text and its readers. C. S. Lewis’s That Hideous Strength has many different kinds of readers, but the editor can facilitate their understanding of the text, and can provide an accurate text. Critical responses to That Hideous Strength and the Ransom trilogy have included commentary and explanation, mere description, and evaluative criticism. Some critics have displayed fundamental misunderstandings of what Lewis has written: this suggests the need for an annotated edition. Fewer than three pages of an early manuscript survive. The novel has three first editions: British (1945), American (1946), and abridged (1946) —the abridgement was done by Lewis, who revised what he did not excise. In general, the British edition offers a better text, but the revisions in the abridged edition {{must be taken into account}} too. Later editions of the novel have been based on the 1965 paperback edition of the American edition. A number of errors in the American edition, and more introduced by the paperback edition, have been perpetuated and readers nearly 70 years after the novel’s first publication are offered only editions based on faulty editions and with misleadingly documented antecedents. Lewis was extremely widely read and borrowed enthusiastically in a number of ways from many sources and authors. Some of his Classical, Medieval and Renaissance influences have received critical attention, but the field is very wide: a case-study of the influence of Alanus ab Insulis across all Lewis’s work shows that he turns to Alanus again and again in explorations of hierarchy, God and Nature, and what it is to be human. Lewis’s most important literary Christian mentors were G. K. Chesterton and George MacDonald, both of whom he read from long before his conversion. Case-studies of these two authors show that Chesterton influences Lewis’s thought and style as well as providing numerous sources of ideas and images, while elements of MacDonald’s mythopoeia frequently appear in Lewis’s fiction. A case-study of Lewis’s friend Charles Williams shows that general assumptions about the nature of his influence on That Hideous Strength focus on the wrong things. The cosmology that forms the background to the Ransom trilogy is syncretic, as Lewis combines elements of the Medieval cosmology he describes in The Discarded Image (1964) with later traditions, contemporary knowledge, and contemporary works of speculative fiction. This syncretism enables Lewis to explore human being, human relations with God, and ethical and theological truths from an imaginative standpoint while celebrating such elements of the traditional world-view as the plenitude of creation and the planetary powers. This syncretism has attracted critical responses ranging widely from warm enthusiasm to strong disapprobation. A set of Preliminary Notes acts as a bridge between the Introduction and the Annotations, covering a wide range of topics: questions of objective value (“Men Without Chests”); Lewis’s introduction of himself and autobiographical elements into the trilogy (“Lewis as Character”); Lewis’s exploration in the novel, as well as in ethical and critical works, of the moral dangers inherent in the desire to belong (“The Inner Ring”); the sources of, and the use Lewis makes of, the Arthurian material in That Hideous Strength (“Logres”); the way in which Lewis presents and uses blasphemy, profanity, and swearing in the trilogy (“Blasphemy and Swearing”); Lewis’s rejection (following Chesterton), in the novel and in other writings, of the notion that remedial treatment can be more humane than retributive punishment (“Humane Remedial Treatment”); Lewis’s fictional presentation of questions about time and possible perceptions and understandings of it (“Philosophies of Time”); Lewis’s invented language and the way in which his presentation of it evolves over the trilogy (“The Language of Creation”). Although paper or electronic <b>variorum</b> <b>editions</b> have many benefits, they are in general difficult for a reader, and a collated, “eclectic”, annotated edition that can serve as a critical or a reading text of That Hideous Strength is offered here. The edition shows what changes Lewis made for the abridged edition, and includes a full apparatus criticus and textual notes justifying decisions taken about substantive differences and instances where the editor has not followed the copy text. The annotations seek to explicate the contexts of the novel. Lewis’s fiction is consistent with his Christian belief, his apologetical and ethical writings, and his critical work, and draws on a wide range of influences: the annotations explicate these points, as well us providing historical information and explaining allusions that may have become unclear with the passage of time. This edition concludes with three appendices. Appendix A provides a variorum presentation of the extant manuscript fragments and the corresponding passages in the three first editions of the novel. Appendix B explores the internal chronology of the novel, which is not always consistent. Appendix C demonstrates an unexpected example of That Hideous Strength’s influence, showing Peter O’Donnell’s borrowings in some of his crime thrillers...|$|R
