40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} individual transferable quota regimes on technology choice, such as choice of vessel size, by using the laboratory experiment method. We find that even if <b>vessel</b> <b>sizes</b> change over time, the quota price can converge to the fundamental value conditioned on the vessels chosen. We also find that subjects choose their vessel type to maximise their profits based on the quota trading prices in the previous period. This result implies that the efficiency of quota markets in the beginning period is important because any inefficiency in quota markets may affect <b>vessel</b> <b>sizes</b> in ensuing periods. Moreover, {{we find that the}} initial allocations may significantly influence <b>vessel</b> <b>sizes</b> through two channels: first, a higher initial allocation to a subject increases the likelihood that the subject invests in a large-sized vessel; second, the quota price may be higher and more unstable under unequal allocation than under equal allocation; thus, whether the allocation is equal influences subjects' choice of vessel type. © 2014 Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Inhibition of {{angiogenesis}} {{has shown}} clinical success {{in patients with}} cancer. Thus, imaging approaches that allow for the identification of angiogenic tumors and the detection of response to anti-angiogenic treatment are of high clinical relevance. Experimental Design: We established an in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach {{that allows us to}} simultaneously image tumor microvessel density and tumor <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> in a NSCLC model in mice. Results: Using microvessel density imaging we demonstrated an increase in microvessel density within 8 days after tumor implantation, while tumor <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> decreased indicating a switch from macro- to microvessels during tumor growth. Moreover, we could monitor in vivo inhibition of angiogenesis induced by the angiogenesis inhibitor PTK 787, resulting in a decrease of microvessel density and a slight increase in tumor <b>vessel</b> <b>size.</b> Conclusions: We present an in vivo imaging approach that allows us to monitor both tumor microvessel density and tumor <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> in the tumor. Moreover, this approach enables us to assess, early-on, treatment effects on tumor microvessel density as well as on tumor <b>vessel</b> <b>size.</b> Thus, this imaging-based strategy of validating anti-angiogenic treatment effects ha...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the influence of <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> on the outcomes of patients after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. BackgroundThere are no dedicated studies {{on the influence of}} <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> on the outcomes of patients treated with different DES. MethodsThe study population was composed of 2, 058 consecutive patients who received sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) or paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES). Patients were grouped into tertiles according to <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> (2. 84 mm in the upper tertile). The primary end point was target lesion revascularization (TLR). Secondary end points were binary angiographic restenosis and the composite of death or myocardial infarction. ResultsVessel size did not influence the composite end point of death and myocardial infarction. The TLR rates were higher among patients in the lower tertile (12. 1 %) as compared with the middle (8. 4 %) and upper (8. 0 %) tertiles (p = 0. 02). In a multivariate analysis, <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> emerged an independent predictor of TLR (p = 0. 009). The model showed also a significant interaction between DES type and <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> regarding TLR (p = 0. 008). There was a significant difference in TLR rates among patients treated with SESs (8. 6 %) and PESs (16. 4 %) in the lower tertile (p = 0. 002), but not in the middle and upper tertiles. ConclusionsThe influence of <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> on restenosis is related to the specific DES used, with SESs providing better outcomes than PESs in small but not in large coronary vessels...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} a robust magnetic resonance (MR) vessel size imaging (VSI) method for the noninvasive assessment of mean vessel size in solid tumors in a clinical dose range of ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIO). Therefore, USPIO-enhanced MR-VSI was performed on DU- 4475, MDA-MB- 435, and EOMA tumor–bearing mice xenografts with known differences in angiogenic activity and vessel morphology. MR results were compared to <b>vessel</b> <b>sizes</b> determined by immunohistochemistry (anti-CD 31) and by intravital microscopy (IVM). MR-VSI revealed significantly different mean <b>vessel</b> <b>sizes</b> between the xenograft models at both USPIO doses (DU- 4475 : 20. 6 ± 4. 9 mm; MDA-MB- 435 : 37. 4 ± 8. 8 μm; and EOMA: 60. 3 ± 9. 6 μm at 80 μmol/kg; p <. 05). Immunohistochemistry revealed lower values for all tumor entities, whereas the size distribution was in line with MR-measurements. IVM corroborated the MR results for DU- 4475 and MDA-MB 435, but showed similar <b>vessel</b> <b>sizes</b> for MDA-MB- 435 and EOMA.

30|$|Accurate {{measurement}} (length, diameter) of {{the primary}} pathology such as aneurysm, dissection, rupture and congenital abnormality is required for selecting the appropriate sized device. In patients with an aneurysm, 10 – 15  % over sizing of stent grafts is ideally preferred to prevent stent migration and optimal seal [57]. It {{is important to consider}} measurements of the lumen and overall <b>vessel</b> <b>size.</b> In patient with aneurysm and adherent wall thrombus, the <b>vessels</b> <b>size</b> is significantly larger than the lumen size. The risk of rupture correlates with overall <b>vessel</b> <b>size,</b> which therefore determines surgical or interventional indication.

40|$|Based on the xylem <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> and {{frequency}} in fossil wood, {{a number of}} studies have developed theories on climate change through time. The basic premise of these studies is that xylem <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> decreases while <b>vessel</b> frequency increases with intensifying aridity. In this paper the relationship between rainfall and xylem <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> {{and frequency}} is examined in two extant tree species. The results indicate that rainfall is related positively to vessel diameter and negatively to vessel frequency in Combretum apiculatum and Protea caffra. Xylem <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> of both species is between 50 and 100 µm. However, the two species exhibit different responses to rainfall in that P. caffra has much smaller diameter vessels than C. apiculatum in high rainfall areas.

40|$|A physics based {{mathematical}} model is developed {{to simulate the}} random transit maritime traffic through the Strait of Istanbul. Based on the geographical characteristics of the Strait and random distributions of surface currents, arrival of transit vessels, <b>vessel</b> <b>sizes</b> and pilotage error in the Strait, the model computes probability distributions of northbound and southbound vessel positions within the Strait. When the pilotage error is zero, {{the perception of the}} surface currents and the handling of the ship is perfect. Deviating from this condition, the autopilot fails to handle the ship and perceive the surface currents perfectly. Hence, the deflection of ships from their original routes cause a distribution of vessel positions along established checklines. The results indicate that the effect of pilotage on the casualty risk depends on the vessel size and the position in the waterway. Using the geographical characteristics of the Strait, the model estimated the probability distribution of vessel casualties. Risk maps showing the expected number of accidents in different sections of the Strait are generated for different <b>vessel</b> <b>sizes</b> and casualty types including collion, ramming and grounding...|$|E

An important fact within the industry is the increasing <b>vessel</b> <b>sizes.</b> Actually, within the last decade the ship size in the Asia-Europe trade has eﬀectively doubled. However, port productivity has not doubled along with the larger <b>vessel</b> <b>sizes.</b> This has led to increased vessel turn around times at ports which indeed is a severe problem. In order to meet the industry targets a game-changer in container handling is required. Indented berth structure is one important opportunity to handle this issue.

Accordingly, in this paper, we approach the quay crane scheduling problem at an indented berth structure. We focus on the challenges and constraints related to the novel architecture.

We investigated {{the role of}} inflammation in flow-mediated vascular remodeling using a murine model of partial outflow reduction without flow cessation or neointima formation. Common carotid arteries decreased in size after ipsilateral external carotid artery ligation in wild-type mice, but not in myeloid differentiation protein- 88 (MyD 88) –deficient mice. Inward remodeling was associated with MyD 88 -dependent and superoxide-initiated cytokine and chemokine production, as well as transient adventitial macrophage accumulation and activation.
