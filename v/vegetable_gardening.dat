2500|$|There {{were some}} {{differences}} {{for those who}} stayed in the highlands. Men started working with the new businesses and industries, while women {{were not able to}} work as wage laborers. Women earned cash in other ways as street vendors or as maids in ladino homes. Some of the street vendors sold handmade crafts to tourist in the cities, and these women organized into artisan collectives. They also formed other types of economic collectives such as for bread-making and <b>vegetable</b> <b>gardening.</b> [...] Rural women could also remain in their village and still contribute to the collective. This was an early instance of women organizing and working to better themselves. The maids earned cash, but suffered abuse in the ladino plantations. Physical and sexual abuse were commonly committed by the ladino landowners against the women who worked in their homes. Independence, new skills, and grievances gained from these experiences led women to join the EZLN.|$|E
