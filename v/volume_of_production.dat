This work deals with the identification of factors affecting the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> industrial <b>production.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this thesis is to create an econometric model, identify factors affecting the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> industrial <b>production</b> in the Czech Republic.

[...] The <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> meant that prices were fairly low, except for the best known artists; as in most subsequent periods there was a steep price gradient for more fashionable artists. Those without a strong contemporary reputation, or who {{had fallen out of}} fashion, including many now considered among the greatest of the period, such as Vermeer, Frans Hals and Rembrandt in his last years, had considerable problems earning a living, and died poor; many artists had other jobs, or abandoned art entirely.

6000|$|In France, {{before the}} Revolution, {{property}} was divided among {{a very few}} people. A few thousand nobles and priests and merchants had all the wealth in the country; twenty-five million peasants had nothing. But in modern States, such as we see around us in the world to-day, property is very widely divided. I do not say it is evenly divided. I do not say it is fairly divided, {{but it is very}} widely divided. Especially is that true in Great Britain. Nowhere else in the world, except, perhaps, in France and the United States, are there such vast numbers of persons who are holders of interest-bearing, profit-bearing, rent-earning property, and the whole tendency of civilisation and of free institutions is to an ever-increasing <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and an increasingly wide diffusion of profit. And therein lies the essential stability of modern States. There are millions of persons who would certainly lose by anything like a general overturn, and they are everywhere the strongest and best organised millions. And I have no hesitation in saying that any violent movement would infallibly encounter an overwhelming resistance, and that any movement which was inspired by mere class prejudice, or by a desire to gain a selfish advantage, would encounter from the selfish power of the [...] "haves" [...] an effective resistance which would bring it to sterility and to destruction.|$|E

6000|$|But turn to {{consider}} {{the magnitude of the}} change that has come about with the era of machinery and the indescribable increase which it has brought to man's power over his environment. There is no need to recite here in detail the marvelous record of mechanical progress that constituted the [...] "industrial revolution" [...] of the eighteenth century. The utilization of coal for the smelting of iron ore; the invention of machinery that could spin and weave; the application of the undreamed energy of steam as a motive force, the building of canals and the making of stone roads--these proved but the beginnings. Each stage of invention called for a further advance. The quickening of one part of the process necessitated the [...] "speeding up" [...] of all the others. It placed a premium--a reward already in sight--upon the next advance. Mechanical spinning called forth the power loom. The increase in production called for new means of transport. The improvement of transport still further swelled the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> The steamboat of 1809 and the steam locomotive of 1830 were the direct result of what had gone before. Most important of all, the movement had become a conscious one. Invention was no longer the fortuitous result of a happy chance. Mechanical progress, the continual increase of power and the continual surplus of product became {{an essential part of the}} environment, and an unconscious element in the thought and outlook of the civilized world.|$|E
