40|$|Consumer’s {{preferences}} for cured ham are investigated with conjoint analysis. A mixed rank-ordered logit model {{which allows the}} investigation for heterogeneous preferences and its sources is estimated. In particular, we analyse to what extent consumers’ socio-demographic traits affect their price-sensitiveness and whether consumer’s sensory (hedonic) valuations and attitudes towards ham with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) affect the {{preferences for}} specific attributes. The results show that consumers with a low-medium age and income are more price sensitive. Consumers more leaned sensorially towards the own regional product (with or <b>without</b> <b>PDO),</b> {{are more inclined to}} purchase this product, and consumers with a more favourable attitude towards PDO ham, are also more prone to purchase cured ham with quality certification in comparison with a product <b>without</b> <b>PDO.</b> Accordingly, the PDO scheme attracts a segment of consumers, but still the origin by itself is a more powerful signal of quality.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{research}} on competitive interdependency of Italian extra virgin olive oil through analysis of the sales scanner data. The paper analyses the strengths and weaknesses of Social Network Analysis approach in the olive oil market. The research addresses issues of three segments of high quality olive oils: popular extra virgin olive oil, pdo/pgi extra virgin olive oils, and finally, the " 100 % Italian olive oil". The analysis results show several aspects. The extra virgin olive oil market is highly polarized. There are large industrial companies with national products and other smes with regional products. While large enterprises have an intensive distribution in all grocery shops, in the distributions of smes the situation is much more complex. Some smes have a very strong sales organization, but fail to have similar market shares. Conversely, other small businesses, even if they have a low level of distribution, are able to gain market share more high. The analysis of sales by the sna approach remains a useful tool for smes which need to rationalize their presence in the grocery sector. Finally, the analysis shows segments of the market (<b>pdo,</b> <b>pgi,</b> bio, etc.) where smes may be able to compete with large industrial firms. ...|$|R

The headspace concentrations of the volatiles, as measured with high sensitivity proton-transfer mass spectrometry, were subsequently subjected to partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Farmers' cheese of Leiden showed a distinct volatile profile with 27 and 9 out of the 60 predominant ions showing respectively significantly higher and lower concentrations in the headspace of the cheese {{in comparison to the}} other cumin cheeses. The PLS-DA prediction models developed classified in cross-validation 96 % of the samples of PDO protected, artisanal farmers' cheese of Leiden correctly, against 100 % of commercial cumin cheese samples. The characteristic volatile compounds were tentatively identified by PTR-time-of-flight-MS. A consumer test indicated differences in appreciation, overall flavor intensity, creaminess, and firmness between the two cheese groups. The consumers' appreciation of the cumin cheese tested was not influenced by the presence of a name label or PDO trademark...|$|R

40|$|Peaches with PDO Calanda {{are one of}} the 20 fruits with PDO {{existing}} in Spain. The aim of this work is to understand how consumers make their choices based on the most important peaches’ attributes and levels. In this work, 4 attributes with 3 levels in each attribute have been considered (price: 1. 5 €/kg, 2. 5 €/kg and 3. 5 €/kg; origin: PDO Calanda, non PDO Calanda and non Calanda; packaging: bulk, conventional packaging and active packaging; and fruit size: small, medium and big). Four Best-Worst (BW) exploded models have been utilised, two of them with scale factors. All those models have been compared to two traditional Discrete Choice (DC) models. Results show that traditional DC models have better performance than the other models and the best model is when consumers select the best option. Within the exploded models, the choice sequence decisions starting from worst options are better than those which start from best option. Consumers prefer PDO Calanda peaches over other types and the positive difference in their Willingness to Pay (WTP) are {{more or less the same}} between peaches from Calanda with <b>PDO</b> and <b>without</b> <b>PDO</b> as it is between the latter and peaches coming from other origins. best-worst, exploding models, consumer behavior, choice experiment, fruit quality., Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|R

40|$|After the Fischler {{reform of}} the year 2003, the Eu has started a {{complete}} revision of its policy for agricultural product quality that should {{be completed by the}} end of 2010 or the beginning of 2011. This paper analyzes the most relevant aspects and offers an evaluation of the options that are still under discussion. The first part of this paper illustrates the most important and peculiar aspects characterizing quality in the agricultural and food sector. Then, after a historical review of Eu policy for agricultural and food quality in the last decades, this paper presents the most common certification tools currently available, aimed at successfully differentiating Agri-food products in order to obtain price premium. In the core of this paper, we analyze and discuss the most important options under discussion with respect to major aspects of the policy for food quality: the reform of <b>Pdo</b> and <b>Pgi,</b> possible modification to the Traditional Specialties Guaranteed (Tsg), possible choices with respect to the possibility of a mandatory indication of the country of origin of the agricultural raw material and the regulation of the use of reserved terms. Moreover, we motivate the need to introduce a new certification system at the Eu level with reference to Integrated Production, and the need for a strong institutional communication campaign and a more effective custom control system at the border of the Eu with respect to minimum quality standards...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} analysis of typical agri-food products requires {{to be focused}} on the following issues: i) the specific features of the offering system; ii) the technical restrictions established by the EU regulations on Protected designation of origin (<b>Pdo</b> and <b>Pgi)</b> and, iii) the strategies aimed at product differentiation and for value creation for the consumer. Considering this latest aspect, it is important to notice that the specificity of the agricultural raw materials, the use of traditional production techniques of production coming from the tradition of the place and certification represent only a prerequisite for the differentiation of the product on the market against standard products. The problem is that the specificity of local product comes from attributes (tangible and intangible) of quality which are not directly accessible, nor verifiable, by the consumer when he/she makes purchasing choices. This situation persists despite the greater propensity of modern consumer to make investments in information and his/her greater attention and larger background towards the acknowledgement of different offers based on quality. This paper tends to develop an analysis on a theoretical and operative basis upon open strategies that can be implemented at the enterprise level, and that of agro-food chain and of territorial system in order to promote the quality of products to consumers. In particular, the work addresses the problems connected to the establishment of competitive advantages for Protected Designation of Origin (Pdo) and Protected Geographical Indication (Pgi), highlighting that in order to achieve those advantages, firms offering typical products need to differentiate their offering on both material and immaterial ground acting on intrinsic and extrinsic attributes of quality of products, on specific features (natural, historical, cultural, etc.) of territorial, on the efficiency of the offering organizational structure, and finally on the presence of social and institutional specific networks. All these aspects point out the necessity of defining appropriate value strategies based on marketing principles which allow to translate the typicality of products into additional value for the consumer in order to enable the producers to acquire a premium price...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to apply the hedonic price method to make an {{estimation}} of the influences between some characteristics of wine and its final price. The sample take into account includes the wines that Lazio (a region located in the center of Italy) has presented at Vinitaly in 2007. This sample can be considered representatives of the most important regional firms active in the market wine. As knows, the theoretical framework of the hedonic price method consider that in a differentiated market the consumer utility is generate not only from the consume but also from other benefits connected to the specific quality attributes. The final price is the sum of the implicit prices paid for every these attributes. In case of wine, they can be extrinsic (vintage, colour, grapes, region of origin, presence of <b>pdo</b> or <b>pgi</b> mark, brand name, etc.) or intrinsic (sensorial characteristics, special taste, etc.). In the first case, the evaluation is made using the information available in the wine labels while in the second case it is impossible to made an evaluation before the purchase and consumption. In many cases wine consumers do not have sufficient practice to evaluate this kind of quality and, as a consequence, an important source of information is represented by the wine guides that contain judgment of experts and quality ratings. Starting from a sample of 294 wine labels, the hedonic price function has been estimated using E-Views software (ols method) and making a regression between prices and extrinsic and intrinsic characteristics of wines. The functional form used is the log-linear form. The results put on evidence that red wines have a premium price (+ 16 %) with respect to the white wines and that there is not any influence from the mark policies. Small firms have a premium price (+ 18 %) with respect to big firms. The judgment of experts has a positive correlation to the price: the value of premium price increases when the quality rating increases. No correlation has been found between the presence of pdo/pgi marks and this suggests that in this case the presence of denomination of origin is not associated with quality and do not obtain a premium price. Considering the region of origin, the estimation highlights a premium price for wines produced in Ciociaria, that is a small area in the south of the region that produces a relative small quantity of wines. ...|$|R

40|$|Olive oil {{traceability}} {{remains a}} challenge nowadays. DNA analysis {{is the preferred}} approach to an effective <b>varietal</b> identification, <b>without</b> any environmental influence. Specifically, olive organelle genomics is the most promising approach for setting up a suitable set of markers as they would {{not interfere with the}} pollinator variety DNA traces. Unfortunately, plastid DNA (cpDNA) variation of the cultivated olive has been reported to be low. This feature could be a limitation for the use of cpDNA polymorphisms in forensic analyses or oil traceability, but rare cpDNA haplotypes may be useful as they can help to efficiently discriminate some varieties. Recently, the sequencing of olive plastid genomes has allowed the generation of novel markers. In this study, the performance of cpDNA markers on olive oil matrices, and their applicability on commercial Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) oils were assessed. By using a combination of nine plastid loci (including multi-state microsatellites and short indels), it is possible to fingerprint six haplotypes (in 17 Spanish olive varieties), which can discriminate high-value commercialized cultivars with PDO. In particular, a rare haplotype was detected in genotypes used to produce a regional high-value commercial oil. We conclude that plastid haplotypes can help oil traceability in commercial PDO oils and set up an experimental methodology suitable for organelle polymorphism detectio...|$|R
40|$|Genealogical {{data have}} been used very widely to {{construct}} indices with which to examine the contribution of plant breeding programmes to the maintenance and enhancement of genetic resources. In this paper we use such indices to examine changes in the genetic diversity of the winter wheat crop in England and Wales between 1923 and 1995. We find that, except for one period characterized by the dominance of imported varieties, the genetic diversity of the winter wheat crop has been remarkably stable. This agrees with many studies of plant breeding programmes elsewhere. However, underlying {{the stability of the}} winter wheat crop is accelerating <b>varietal</b> turnover <b>without</b> any significant diversification of the genetic resources used. Moreover, the changes we observe are more directly attributable to changes in the varietal shares of the area under winter wheat than to the genealogical relationship between the varieties sown. We argue, therefore, that while genealogical indices reflect how well plant breeders have retained and exploited the resources with which they started, these indices suffer from a critical limitation. They do not reflect the proportion of the available range of genetic resources which has been effectively utilized in the breeding programme: complex crosses of a given set of varieties can yield high indices, and yet disguise the loss (or non-utilization) of {{a large proportion of the}} available genetic diversity...|$|R
