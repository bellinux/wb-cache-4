40|$|A rigid wall {{model has}} been used widely in the {{numerical}} simulation of rail vehicle impacts. Finite element impact modelling of rail vehicles is generally based on a half-width and full-length or half-length structure, depending on the symmetry. The structure and components of rail vehicles are normally designed to cope with proof loading to ensure adequate ride performance. In this paper, the authors present a study of a rail <b>vehicle</b> <b>with</b> <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> focused on improving the modelling approach and exploring the intrinsic structural weaknesses to enhance its crashworthiness. The underpinning research used finite element analysis and compared the behaviour of the rail vehicle in different impact scenarios. It {{was found that the}} simulation of a rigid wall impact can mask structural weaknesses; that even a completely symmetrical impact may lead to an asymmetrical result; that downward bending is an intrinsic weakness of conventional rail vehicles and that a rigid part of the vehicle structure, such as the body bolster, may cause uncoordinated deformation and shear fracture between the vehicle sections. These findings have significance for impact simulation, the full-scale testing of rail vehicles and rail vehicle design in general...|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{other members}} of the Pendolino rail family, the ETR 490 {{trainset}} is composed of only three cars: two motors <b>vehicles,</b> <b>with</b> <b>driving</b> <b>cabs,</b> and a trailer vehicle in the centre. Its motor system {{is similar to that of}} an electric multiple unit because its pantograph is not located on a locomotive. The motor cars on either end of the train contain a pair of motor bogies, with one asynchronous motors per bogie. Static and other converters are also located underneath the motor cars.|$|R
50|$|The CargoSprinter was {{developed}} in 1996 by Windhoff in association with freight operators DB Cargo and Fraport. The concept was for a self powered container carrying freight train, with a relatively high top speed enabling it to operate without disrupting passenger services. The train was a five-car permanently connected set of container-carrying <b>vehicles</b> (capacity ~10TEU), <b>with</b> <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> at each end (motorised with underfloor engines), and capable of being easily connected and worked in multiple with other CargoSprinter trains. The original designs were taken from concept stage to production in 12 months.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} present a {{crashworthiness}} assessment {{and suggestions for}} modification of a conventionally designed rail <b>vehicle</b> <b>with</b> a <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> (cab car). The analytical approach, based on numerical analysis, consisted of two stages. Firstly, the crashworthiness of the cab car was assessed by simulating a collision between the cab car and a rigid wall. Then, after analysing structural weaknesses, {{the design of the}} cab car was modified and simulated again in the same scenario. It was found that downward bending is an intrinsic weakness in conventional rail vehicles and that jackknifing is a main form of failures in conventional rail vehicle components. The cab car, as modified by the authors, overcomes the original weaknesses and shows the desired progressive collapse behaviour in simulation. The conclusions have general relevance for other studies but more importantly, point to the need for a rethink of some aspects of rail vehicle design...|$|R

5000|$|This {{terminology}} {{has fallen}} out of use for newer locomotives, since it only really applied to the cab unit style of locomotive. Thus, the term cab unit is used only when an A unit has a carbody design. Hood unit [...] "road switcher" [...] types were generally equipped <b>with</b> <b>driving</b> <b>cabs</b> and the term [...] "A unit" [...] was not generally applied to them, although the rare cabless road switchers were still called B units.|$|R
50|$|The China Railways DFH1 was {{a type of}} 4-axle B'B' single-cab diesel-hydraulic {{locomotive}} used on mainline passenger services; the DFH3 was a later development of a similar design but <b>with</b> two <b>driving</b> <b>cabs.</b>|$|R
50|$|A B unit, in {{railroad}} terminology, is {{a locomotive}} unit (generally a diesel locomotive) {{which does not}} have a <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> or crew compartment, and must therefore be controlled from another, coupled locomotive <b>with</b> a <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> (an A unit). The terms booster unit and cabless are also used. The concept is largely confined to North America. Elsewhere, locomotives without <b>driving</b> <b>cabs</b> are rare.|$|R
50|$|In 1967 the Southern Region {{wished to}} replace steam trains to Weymouth with through {{carriages}} {{but could not}} justify electrification beyond Bournemouth. Class 432 4REP was a high-power unit: between London and Bournemouth it was attached {{to one or two}} Class 438 4TC trailer units <b>with</b> <b>driving</b> <b>cabs.</b> At Bournemouth the 4REP was detached and a British Rail Class 33 locomotive adapted for push-pull working was attached at the front. This hauled the trailer units to Weymouth and pushed them back. The line from Bournemouth to Weymouth was eventually electrified in 1988.|$|R
50|$|A {{cab unit}} is a carbody unit <b>with</b> a <b>driving</b> <b>cab,</b> or crew compartment. Thus, a cab unit is also always an A unit (a {{locomotive}} with a cab). By contrast, a carbody unit {{can be either}} an A unit, or a B unit (a locomotive without a cab).|$|R
50|$|It is not {{necessary}} for every single car in an MU to be motorized. Therefore, MU cars can be motor units or trailer units. Instead of motors, trailing units can contain supplementary equipment such as air compressors, batteries, etc.; trailer cars may also be fitted <b>with</b> a <b>driving</b> <b>cab.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{camelback}} locomotive (also {{known as}} a Mother Hubbard or a center-cab locomotive) {{is a type of}} steam locomotive <b>with</b> the <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> placed in the middle, astride the boiler. Camelbacks were fitted with wide fireboxes which would have severely restricted driver visibility from the normal cab location at the rear.|$|R
25|$|The line used Metropolitan line A60 and A62 sub-surface {{rolling stock}} built by Cravens of Sheffield in two batches between 1960 and 1962. It was {{upgraded}} in 1994 with improved suspension, lighting, heating and ventilation. The rolling stock was regularly interchanged with that {{used on the}} main Metropolitan line and usually carried both East London and Metropolitan line maps, but ELL trains were four-car units <b>with</b> a <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> at each end, unlike Metropolitan line trains, which, aside from the Chesham shuttle, ran as eight-car trains. Metropolitan line trains were mostly two single-ended units coupled together <b>with</b> fully operational <b>driving</b> <b>cabs</b> at each end: the Met could use any ELL trains, but the ELL could use only double-ended units.|$|R
25|$|In 1968 {{an order}} was placed for 35 six-car trains {{to replace the}} CP and CO stock on the Hammersmith & City and Circle lines. These were {{arranged}} as two units <b>with</b> a <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> in the motor car at one end only, and were normally run as three pairs. These trains were designated C69 stock.|$|R
5000|$|The {{carriages}} {{were built}} by BN in Bruges, Belgium between 1995 and 1997. [...] Three types were constructed: 36 of an [...] "A type" [...] with 60 seats in 2+1 seating formation, 106 of a [...] "B type" [...] with 80 seats in 2+2 formation, and 21 [...] "BDX type" [...] with 58 seats and incorporating a control car <b>with</b> a <b>driving</b> <b>cab.</b>|$|R
5000|$|AB6 - Two B units built <b>with</b> a flat-fronted <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. These {{were used}} to take one portion of a train to a side {{destination}} {{while the rest of}} the train continued onward.|$|R
50|$|Nine eight-car sets (6121, 6151, 6161, 6171, 6181, 6197, 6201, 6271, and 6281) {{were shipped}} to Indonesia, {{entering}} revenue service there from August 2000. In 2004, the trainsets were reformed into eight six-car sets and three eight-car sets, {{made possible by}} rebuilding some former intermediate cars <b>with</b> new <b>driving</b> <b>cabs.</b> The fleet subsequently underwent further extensive reorganization and rebuilding of driving cars damaged in accidents.|$|R
50|$|No. 3267 is {{the sole}} {{surviving}} example of the stock built in 1904 for the Tyneside Electrics system, the first suburban electric railway in the country. The system used third rail power and trains formed into multiple units. The vehicle {{was one of two}} on the system fitted out as vans, <b>with</b> <b>driving</b> <b>cabs</b> at each end. They were used to carry fish and sundry goods, as well as acting as the locomotives for passenger services on the Riverside branch. After withdrawal in 1938, the two vans had their motors removed and were converted to de-icing vans, hauled along the system at night by steam locomotives. It has since been restored to NER livery, and is on static display in the museum, on loan from the National Rail Museum.|$|R
50|$|When introduced, {{the train}} {{consisted}} of new carriages {{built by the}} Midland Railway Workshops. In August 1985, Westrail awarded Comeng, Bassendean a contract for five Westrail ADP/ADQ class railcars, three ADPs <b>with</b> <b>driving</b> <b>cabs</b> and two ADQs, using a similar body shell and interior fitout to the New South Wales XPT carriages. Each carriage was powered by a Cummins KTA19 coupled to a Voith transmission. They usually operate as a three or four carriage set. Five carriage set operation is not possible due to the limited platform length available at Perth station.In July 2003, the DMUs were painted in a new livery {{in line with the}} formation of Transwa. In 2007, the DMUs were painted white as part of a refurbishment program. In 2010/11 new seats were fitted.|$|R
