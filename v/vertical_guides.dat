2500|$|The {{crosshead}} engine {{is described as}} having a vertical cylinder above the crankshaft, with the piston rod secured to a horizontal crosshead, from each end of which, {{on opposite sides of}} the cylinder, extended a connecting rod which rotated its own separate crankshaft. The crosshead operated within <b>vertical</b> <b>guides</b> that enabled the assembly to maintain the correct path as it moved. The engine's alternative name [...] "A-frame" [...] presumably derived from the shape of the frames supporting these guides. Some {{crosshead engine}}s had more than one cylinder, in which case the piston rods were usually all connected to the same crosshead. An unusual feature of early examples of this type of engine was the installation of flywheelsgeared to the crankshaftswhich were thought necessary to ensure smooth operation.

This arrangement is as follows: From each bearing a chain is led, over a guide pulley situated {{at the top of}} the guide belonging to that bearing, to an arm fixed on a rocking-shaft placed close to the floor of the vessel. On this rocking-shaft there is also fixed another arm, and from this a chain proceeds aft to the piston rod of a horizontal steam cylinder, placed as shown in Fig. 2. This cylinder is provided with a slide valve, by which the steam can be admitted to or released from the forward end of the cylinder at pleasure; and, when the steam is so admitted, it drives back the piston, and, by means of the arrangement of chains and rocking-shaft already described, raised the guide tube, through which the main tube passes, and thus depresses that end of the latter which carries the torpedo. The extent to which the piston in the steam cylinder is driven back, and, consequently, the extent to which the guide tube is raised, is regulated by means of a screw which passes through the back cylinder cover, this screw, which is furnished with a handwheel and check-nut, forming a stop against which the piston rests when driven back by the steam.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a free-surface slender two-dimensional stream (liquid sheet) issuing from a nozzle in the gravitational field in still air, under {{the effect of}} surface-active agents, are analysed experimentally. The particular test section geometry (the liquid is forced to assume a bidimensional form between two <b>vertical</b> <b>guides</b> and a horizontal plate placed at a certain variable distance from the nozzle exit section) employed in this study gives rise to various flow regimes depending on the governing parameters: liquid flow rate, sheet height, surface pressure, gravity. Two basic phenomena are observed: thinning of the sheet (with recirculating motion inside it) and sheet-threadlines transition. For a certain surfactant (bulk) concentration, there exists a minimum critical flow rate value for which the sheet is seen to thin starting at both of the sheet bottom corners. A ridge, usually {{referred to as a}} Reynolds ridge in the literature, separates the sheet from the thin-film regions. The thin films exhibit recirculating flows (caused by the onset of surfactant-induced surface-pressure-driven convection in the gravitational field) and extend to the entire rectangular interface as the flow rate is reduced. At zero flow rate the thinned sheet resembles a plane vertical soap him showing a recirculating cellular structure. These phenomena are linked to the presence of surface-active material adsorbed at the liquid-air interface and occur when the sheet height exceeds a critical value. Otherwise, at a critical flow rate value the liquid sheet breaks up into an array of (more or less regularly distributed) discrete threadlines (vertical jets), whose spacing depends on the surface tension of the test liquid...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Extraction, periodontitis, or trauma {{can cause}} a {{reduction}} on the alveolar ridge. This could result in an insufficient alveolar bone width and height. Different techniques of vertical bone augmentation are described in literature. However, nowadays {{there is not enough}} evidence against lateral augmentation procedures to verify if these techniques are stable {{over a long period of}} time. Objective This review analyses the different techniques that are used to vertically augment the bone and evaluate if these techniques are stable over a long period of time. Material and Methods The MEDLINE-PubMed database was searched from its earliest records until December 22, 2014. The following search term was used: Alveolar Ridge augmentation [MESH]. Several journals were hand searched and some authors were contacted for additional information. The primary outcome measure that was analyzed was marginal bone level change around dental implants in the augmented sites, and the secondary outcomes were survival and success rates of dental implants placed in the augmented sites. Results The search yielded 203 abstracts. Ultimately, 90 articles were selected, describing 51 studies meeting the eligibility criteria. The marginal bone level change for the inlay technique and <b>vertical</b> <b>guided</b> bone regeneration are in agreement with the success criteria. Alveolar distraction showed more marginal bone level change after the first year of loading, and for the inlay technique very few studies were available. Conclusions Based on the available data in the current existing studies with a follow-up period of at least 4 to 5 years, one can summarize that there seems to be a trend that the onlay technique, alveolar distraction, and <b>vertical</b> <b>guided</b> bone regeneration are stable for at least 4 to 5 years...|$|R

30|$|Osseointegrated {{implants}} for {{the replacement}} of missing teeth have recently become a routine treatment option [1, 2]. However, any tooth loss may be followed by extensive resorption of the alveolar ridge, which usually makes implant placement difficult or impossible {{because of the lack}} of bone volume. There are a variety of defect situations with increasing complexity, ranging from fenestrations, to dehiscences, to both horizontal and vertical deficiencies, while combinations of these also occur. Ridge augmentation techniques are available to effectively and predictably increase the width of the alveolar ridge in horizontal deficiencies. If vertical deficiencies are present, including in combination, the predictability of the techniques is usually substantially lower [3]. A significant bone defect is an anatomical limitation that can be overcome using different surgical techniques, including vertically guided bone regeneration.

For a sphere of 10 m diameter and an incident sinusoidal wave of 9 s period and 0. 5 m elevation amplitude, the maximum time-average absorbed power is 172 kW, 137 kW, and 24 kW for {{the cases of}} reactive control, latching control, and no phase control, respectively. With latching control, the need for reversing energy flow, during parts of each heave cycle, is avoided. For a more practically shaped axisymmetric body, a cylinder with a hemispherical bottom, numerical results for the radiation resistance are quantitatively com-pared with experimental results, by application of approximate semi-empirical elementary function formulae. Performed laboratory model experiments with such an axisymmetric body, which heave resonates {{with a wave of}} frequency 1. 1 Hz, demonstrate that, compared to no phase control, latching control results in an appreciable increase of energy capture from waves of frequency 0. 75 Hz and 0. 5 Hz.

50|$|Transfer {{of power}} to the track is {{accomplished}} by a drive wheel, or drive sprocket, driven by the motor and engaging with holes in the track links or with pegs on them to drive the track. In military vehicles, the drive wheel is typically mounted well above the contact area on the ground, allowing it to be fixed in position. In agricultural crawlers it is normally incorporated {{as part of the}} bogie. Placing suspension on the sprocket is possible, but is mechanically more complicated. A non-powered wheel, an idler, is placed {{at the opposite end of}} the track, primarily to tension the track, since loose track could be easily thrown (slipped) off the wheels. To prevent throwing, the inner surface of the track links usually have <b>vertical</b> <b>guide</b> horns engaging grooves, or gaps between the doubled road and idler/sprocket wheels. In military vehicles with a rear sprocket, the idler wheel is placed higher than the road wheels to allow it to climb over obstacles. Some track arrangements use return rollers to keep the top of the track running straight between the drive sprocket and idler. Others, called slack track, allow the track to droop and run along the tops of large road wheels. This was a feature of the Christie suspension, leading to occasional misidentification of other slack track-equipped vehicles.|$|R
40|$|McConnell et al. have {{reported}} preliminary results of hard X-ray polarization {{measured by the}} Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) in an intense solar flare on 2002 July 23. The magnitude of the reported polarization is broadly consistent with the predictions of existing solar flare models which invoke the precipitation of a nonthermal electron beam into a dense chromospheric target. However, {{the orientation of the}} polarization vector lies at a substantial angle to the local solar radial direction. This is inconsistent with model predictions of a polarization vector along the local radial direction, a prediction that is a direct consequence of the assumption of a <b>vertical</b> <b>guiding</b> magnetic field. Smith et al., in a study of the same 2002 July 23 event, have suggested that the magnetic structure in which the flare occurs is tilted relative to the local vertical. Motivated by this observation, and by the preliminary nonradial polarization vector reported by McConnell et al., we explore the effect of tilt of the flaring loop on the magnitude and orientation of the predicted polarization vector. We find that allowing loops tilted from the local solar vertical does indeed permit a much wider range of polarization vector orientations than allowed by purely vertical loop geometries. In particular, adding tilt of the magnitude inferred by Smith et al. for the 2002 July 23 event can in principle account for both the magnitude and direction of the polarization vector reported by McConnell et al. for that event...|$|R

40|$|The {{acceleration}} of polarized beams in circular accelerators {{is complicated by}} the presence of numerous depolarizing resonances. During acceleration, a depolarizing resonance is crossed whenever the spin precession frequency equals the frequency with which spin-perturbing magnetic fields are encountered. There are two main types of depolarizing resonances corresponding to the possible sources of such fields: imperfection resonances, which are driven by magnet errors and misalignments, and intrinsic resonances, driven by the focusing fields. The resonance conditions are usually expressed in terms of the spin tune {nu}{sub s}, which is defined as the number of spin precessions per revolution. For an ideal planar accelerator, where orbiting particles experience only the <b>vertical</b> <b>guide</b> field, the spin tune is equal to G{gamma}, where G = 1. 7928 is the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton and {gamma} is the relativistic Lorentz factor. The resonance condition for imperfection depolarizing resonances arise when {nu}{sub s} = G{gamma} = n, where n is an integer. Imperfection resonances are therefore separated by only 523 MeV energy steps. The condition for intrinsic resonances is {nu}{sub s} = G{gamma} = kP {+-} {nu}{sub y}, where k is an integer, {nu}{sub y} is the vertical betatron tune and P is the superperiodicity. For the AGS, P = 12 and {nu}{sub y} {approx} 8. 8. For most of the time during the acceleration cycle, the precession direction, or stable spin direction, coincides with the main vertical magnetic field. Close to a resonance, the stable spin direction is perturbed away from the vertical direction by the resonance driving fields. When a polarized beam is accelerated through an isolated resonance, the final polarization can be calculated analytically...|$|R
