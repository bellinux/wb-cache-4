5|$|Brettingham was {{commissioned}} in 1742 to redesign Langley Hall, a mansion standing {{in its own}} parkland in South Norfolk. His design was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Palladian style of Holkham, though much smaller: a large principal central block linked to two flanking secondary wings by short corridors. The corner towers, while similar to those later designed by Brettingham at Euston Hall, were {{the work of a}} later owner and architect. The neoclassical entrance lodges were a later addition, by Sir John Soane. In 1743, Brettingham began work on the construction of Hanworth Hall, Norfolk, also in the Palladian style, with a five-bay facade of brick with the centre three bays projected with a pediment.|$|E
5|$|George Gilbert Scott, the {{architect}} of ChristChurch Cathedral, and an empathiser of Mountfort's teacher and mentor Carpenter, wished his former pupil Mountfort to be the clerk of works and supervising architect of the new cathedral project. This proposal was originally vetoed by the Cathedral Commission. Nevertheless, following delays in the building work attributed to financial problems, the position of supervising architect was finally given to Mountfort in 1873. Mountfort was responsible for several alterations to the absentee main architect's design, most obviously the tower and the west porch. He also designed the font, the Harper Memorial, and the north porch. The cathedral was however not finally completed until 1904, six years after Mountfort's death. The cathedral is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> European decorated Gothic style with an attached campanile tower beside {{the body of the}} cathedral, rather than towering directly above it in the more English tradition.|$|E

5|$|Hammer quickly {{sought to}} {{capitalise}} on its good fortune with a sequel. Staff member Jimmy Sangster pitched {{a story about}} a monster emerging from the Earth's core. However, when the company asked Nigel Kneale for permission to use the character of Quatermass, he refused, not wanting to lose control of his creation. Nevertheless, the film went ahead, as X the Unknown (1956), again capitalising on the 'X' Certificate in its title and featuring a newly created scientist character, <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Quatermass mould, played by Dean Jagger. Quatermass did eventually return to cinema screens in Quatermass 2 (1957) and Quatermass and the Pit (1967), both of which had screenplays written by Nigel Kneale and based on serials originally written by him and presented by BBC Television. Rival British film companies also tried to cash in with science fiction films of their own, including Satellite in the Sky, The Gamma People and Fire Maidens from Outer Space (all 1956).|$|E
5|$|Well-known poets of the Edwardian {{era of the}} 1890s, such as Alfred Austin, Stephen Phillips, and William Watson, {{had been}} working <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadow of Tennyson, {{producing}} weak imitations of the poetry of the Victorian era. They continued to work in this vein into {{the early years of}} the 20th century. As the new century opened, Austin was still the serving British Poet Laureate, a post he held up to 1913. In the century's first decade, poetry still had a large audience; volumes of verse published in that time included Thomas Hardy's The Dynasts, Christina Rossetti's posthumous Poetical Works, Ernest Dowson's Poems, George Meredith's Last Poems, Robert Service's Ballads of a Cheechako and John Masefield's Ballads and Poems. Future Nobel Prize winner William Butler Yeats was devoting much of his energy to the Abbey Theatre and writing for the stage, producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period. In 1907, the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Rudyard Kipling.|$|E

Wesleyan Methodist missions began during John Wesley's lifetime and had great success over a long period during which Methodism itself divided into a number of sects and established a definite separation from the Church of England.|$|E
25|$|The other regular in {{the first}} series was Carol Wilson (Ingrid Hafner), the nurse and {{receptionist}} who replaced the slain Peggy. Carol assisted Keel and Steed in cases, and {{in at least one}} episode ("Girl on the Trapeze") being <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thick of the action, but without being part of Steed's inner circle. Hafner had played opposite Hendry as a nurse in one episode of Police Surgeon.|$|E

He was originally lieutenant of the fourteenth company.|$|E

25|$|When {{the news}} reached Europe, Christians were horrified and Pope Sergius IV sent a {{circular}} letter to all churches {{calling for a}} holy fight in the Middle East and expulsion of Muslims from the Holy land. The events would later be recalled by Pope Urban II in his preaching for the Crusade at Clermont. Although the crusades happened almost a century after the desecration and caused by various other complex political intrigues, it was still <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public mind as a cause. It was considered so by William of Tyre.|$|E

50|$|The {{advancement}} of office automation has eliminated some receptionists' jobs. For example, {{a telephone call}} could be answered by an automated attendant. However, a receptionist who possesses strong office/technical skills and who is also adept in courtesy, tact and diplomacy is still considered an asset to a company's business image, and is still <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> demand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> business world.|$|R
25|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of British folk rock that followed {{in the wake of}} Liege & Lief in the 1970s came mainly from three sources. First were existing folk performers who now â€˜electrifiedâ€™, including Mr. Fox, formed around the acoustic duo Bob and Carole Pegg, and Pentangle, who having previously recorded largely without electrification, produced a fourth album, Cruel Sister, in 1970, <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British folk rock mould. Similarly, Swarbrickâ€™s former playing partner, Martin Carthy, joined Steeleye Span in 1971 to howls of protest in the folk music world.|$|E
25|$|A swift {{is a tool}} used to hold a hank of yarn {{while it}} is being wound off. It has an {{adjustable}} diameter {{so that it can}} hold hanks of many sizes, and rotates around a central rod. They are generally made out of wood or metal, however other materials may also be used. In the 18th and 19th centuries, swifts were sometimes made of whale ivory and they are now sought-after antiques. Swifts are not used <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> textile industry, but are used more by knitters and crocheters who buy their yarn in hank form. The swift allows for easy balling, without the yarn getting tangled and knotted.|$|E
25|$|After World War I, Allen County's {{population}} growth lagged {{the state and}} the nation. Galvin was an assistant superintendent at the Peru Steel Casting Co. of Peru, Ind. He then became acting manager at American Steel Foundries in Pittsburgh. In 1921, Lima voters approved a change in the structure of Lima city government. Voters now elected five commissioners, with the commission chair serving as mayor. The charter sought to establish professional management, requiring the commissioners to hire a city manager, who reported to the mayor. Lima proved itself to be <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Progressive tradition with these changes, after flirting with radicalism in 1912 when the voters elected a Socialist mayor.|$|E
