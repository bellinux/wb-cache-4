5|$|A {{disaster}} {{struck the}} colony on 13 August 2010, when a forest fire {{swept through the}} breeding site killing three adults and 25 of the 38 chicks. The fire destroyed the <b>vegetation</b> <b>and</b> several nesting burrows. Conservation action to protect the 13 remaining chicks included removing dead birds and burnt vegetation, reinforcing the surviving nests, and setting poison bait for rats around the now exposed nest sites. In the longer term, the action plan includes the provision of artificial burrows, seed dispersal to help the vegetation recover, {{and the use of}} anti-erosion materials.|$|E
5|$|Adult mecopterans {{are mostly}} scavengers, feeding on {{decaying}} <b>vegetation</b> <b>and</b> the soft bodies of dead invertebrates. Panorpa raid spider webs {{to feed on}} trapped insects and even the spiders themselves, and hangingflies capture flies and moths with their specially modified legs. Some groups consume pollen, nectar, midge larvae, carrion and moss fragments. Most mecopterans live in moist environments; in hotter climates, the adults may therefore be active and visible only for short periods of the year.|$|E

More recent visitors have included P. R.

It is notable for the diversity of insects it supports and its nesting passerine bird populations, which include several uncommon species such as reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), a species that in Britain nests almost exclusively in this habitat.|$|E
5|$|Both {{in water}} and on land, the newts are largely nocturnal. In their aquatic habitats, they hide under <b>vegetation,</b> <b>and</b> on land, they use {{structures}} such as logs, rocks, or small animal burrows for cover.

Predators include herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and various carnivorous mammals.|$|E

40|$|Polarization Coherence Tomography (PCT) {{method has}} the good {{performance}} in deriving the vegetation vertical structure.

In order to overcome this disadvantage, we exploit Complex Least Squares Adjustment Method to compute <b>vegetation</b> height <b>and</b> ground phase based on Random Volume over Ground and Volume Temporal Decorrelation (RVoG + VTD) model. By the fusion of different polarimetric InSAR data, we can use more observations to obtain more robust estimations of temporal decorrelation <b>and</b> <b>vegetation</b> height, <b>and</b> then, we introduce them into PCT to acquire more accurate vegetation vertical structure. Finally the new approach is validated on E-SAR data of Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. The results demonstrate that the robust method can greatly improve accusation of vegetation vertical structure...|$|R
5|$|Carolina wrens {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of <b>vegetation</b> <b>and</b> vines. They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels, or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey. Their diet consists of invertebrates, such as beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, katydids, spiders, ants, bees, and wasps. Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet. Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets, such as fruit pulp and various seeds. In the northern portion of their range, they frequent bird feeders.|$|E
5|$|Fauna is sparse on {{the island}} due to a {{combination}} of a lack of <b>vegetation</b> <b>and</b> the consequences of phosphates mining.

Coconut farming, mining, and introduced species have caused serious disturbance to the native vegetation.|$|E

5|$|Hippo {{defecation}} creates allochthonous {{deposits of}} organic matter along the river beds. These deposits have an unclear ecological function. A 2015 study suggests that hippo dung provides nutrients from terrestrial material for fish and aquatic invertebrates.
