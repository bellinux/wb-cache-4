25|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, Koeberg started {{experiencing}} numerous technical difficulties. On 11 November 2005, a fault on {{a transmission}} busbar caused the reactor to go into safe mode, cutting supply {{to most of the}} Western Cape for about two hours. On 16 November a fire under a 400 kV transmission line caused the line to trip, causing severe <b>voltage</b> <b>dips</b> which resulted in Koeberg once again shutting down. Various parts of the Cape were left without electricity for hours at a time. On the evening of 23 November, a routine inspection of the backup safety system revealed a below-spec concentration of an important chemical, resulting in a controlled shutdown of the reactor. Due to the sufficiency of backup supply, major power cuts were not experienced until Friday 25 November, when the backup capacity began running out. At this point, rotational load shedding was employed, with customers being switched off in stages for most of the day. Koeberg was re-synchronised to the national grid on Saturday 26 November.|$|E
2500|$|However, the tetrode had one new problem. In any tube, {{electrons}} {{strike the}} anode with sufficient energy {{to cause the}} emission of electrons from its surface. In a triode this so-called secondary emission of electrons is not important since they are simply re-captured by the more positive anode (plate). But in a tetrode they can be captured by the screen grid (thus also acting as an anode) since it is also at a high voltage, thus robbing them from the plate current and reducing the amplification of the device. Since secondary electrons can outnumber the primary electrons, in the worst case, particularly as the plate <b>voltage</b> <b>dips</b> below the screen voltage, the plate current can decrease with increasing plate voltage. This is the so-called [...] "tetrode kink" [...] and {{is an example of}} negative resistance which can itself cause instability. The otherwise undesirable negative resistance was exploited to produce an extremely simple oscillator circuit only requiring connection of the plate to a resonant LC circuit to oscillate; this was effective over a wide frequency range. The so-called dynatron oscillator thus operated on the same principle of negative resistance as the tunnel diode oscillator many years later. Another undesirable consequence of secondary emission is that in extreme cases enough charge can flow to the screen grid to overheat and destroy it. Later tetrodes had anodes treated to reduce secondary emission; earlier ones such as the type 77 sharp-cutoff pentode connected as a tetrode made better dynatrons.|$|E

This can occur {{in the event of a}} voltage dip that causes one of the generators to disconnect from the grid. As <b>voltage</b> <b>dips</b> are often caused by too little generation for the load in a distribution grid, removing generation can cause the voltage to drop further.

40|$|Stability and {{security}} of the grid are two vital aspects of energy supply. To keep the grid stable, {{it is necessary that}} the electricity plant can control and protect the mechanism. In the past, traditional plants could meet these requirements. Nowadays, the share of sustainable power sources in total electricity generation has become so important that these sources must keep the grid stable. A significant part of these requirements is the Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) capability of the sustainable energy plant. When some large loads are connected to the grid or as a result of grid faults like lightning strikes or short circuits, short–term <b>voltage</b> <b>dip</b> may occur. This low <b>voltage</b> <b>dip</b> condition plans to be simulated and the behaviours of Brushless Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (B-DFIG) should be improved in this situation. This thesis is going to realize this goal that after the improvement, when low <b>voltage</b> <b>dip</b> occurs, {{it is not necessary to}} disconnect the generator from the grid. The thesis is organized as follows: Firstly, the B-DFIG modelling is implemented, including the steady state modelling by equivalent circuits and the dynamic modelling by differential equations. The steady and transient state characteristic of B-DFIG can be studied by equivalent circuits and dynamic models respectively. Secondly, the control algorithm is added to the power electronic converter to control the machine in a stable and responsive manner. Thirdly, simulations of both full voltage and low <b>voltage</b> <b>dip</b> conditions are done to compare B-DFIG behaviours between these two different simulation conditions. Unexpected performance like large transient current will occur under low <b>voltage</b> <b>dip</b> condition. Fourthly, the LVRT control algorithm is added to the controller of B-DFIG for improving the behaviours of B-DFIG in low <b>voltage</b> <b>dip</b> condition based on some constraints and assumptions.

50|$|The doubly-fed {{generator}} rotors are typically wound with 2 to 3 {{times the number}} of turns of the stator. This means that the rotor voltages will be higher and currents respectively lower. Thus in the typical ± 30% operational speed range around the synchronous speed, the rated current of the converter is accordingly lower which leads to a lower cost of the converter. The drawback is that controlled operation outside the operational speed range is impossible because of the higher than rated rotor voltage. Further, the voltage transients due to the grid disturbances (three- and two-phase <b>voltage</b> <b>dips,</b> especially) will also be magnified. In order to prevent high rotor voltages - and high currents resulting from these voltages - from destroying the IGBTs and diodes of the converter, a protection circuit (called crowbar) is used.|$|E
