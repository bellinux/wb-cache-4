50|$|The AgVision {{terminal}} {{was also}} sold through Radio Shack stores as the <b>VideoTex</b> <b>terminal</b> around 1980. Internal differences, if any, are unclear, as not many AgVision terminals survive to this day.|$|E
50|$|A third mode {{was entered}} {{with a special}} boot floppy which turned the Aster into a <b>Videotex</b> <b>terminal</b> with a 40x25 display and a Videotex {{character}} set, The software used the built in RS232 interface of the Aster to control a modem through which it could contact a Prestel service provider.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} experiments with marketing videotex to consumers in the U.S. was by Radio Shack, which sold a consumer <b>videotex</b> <b>terminal,</b> essentially a single-purpose predecessor to the TRS-80 Color Computer, in outlets across the country. Sales were anemic. Radio Shack later sold a videotex software and hardware package for the Color Computer.|$|E
50|$|The key {{connection}} between artist’s current practice and her early database work is information. Despite originally being trained in painting in 1980s, Tenhaaf {{was determined to}} get a permit from Canadian Department of Communications (DOC) {{to take part in}} the Telidon field trial which was developed by Canadian Communication Research Center (CRC) in 1970s and was considered a “second generation” database. It interested Tenhaaf because the emerging technology was hoped to have a wide commercial appreciation. Giving the opportunity, she created the database Us and/or Them (1983) which was a digital collection of text, maps, graphic design as well as images of Cold War found in various information sources such as magazines, newspapers and even United Nations reports, all of which were presented with manipulated digital graphics. This project introduced a correlation between Boolean concept of “and/or” and the harsh us vs them Cold War attitude. By combining information from both the United States and the Soviet Union origins, the controversial aspect of blame was opened. Later, Tenhaaf recreated the project as an independent show; however, until then initial Us and/or Them (1983) was accessible exclusively online at publicly available <b>videotex</b> <b>terminals.</b> This DOC-sponsored artist project was so significant due to its status as the first example of art about data realm.|$|R
5000|$|The initial {{goal of this}} project, called [...] "Green Thumb," [...] was {{to create}} a low cost <b>Videotex</b> <b>terminal</b> for farmers, ranchers, and others in the {{agricultural}} industry. This terminal would connect to a phone line and an ordinary color television and allow the user access to near-real-time information useful to their day-to-day operations on the farm.|$|E
5000|$|The {{final version}} of the MicroBee, {{released}} in 1987, was the 256TC. This increased the memory to 256 kB of dynamic RAM and had a new keyboard with numeric keypad. The computer had a built in 3.5" [...] floppy disk drive supporting both 800 kB (DSDD) and 400 kB (SSDD) formats. Bundled software included [...] "Videotex" [...] (a <b>videotex</b> <b>terminal</b> program), [...] "Simply Write" [...] (a word processor) and [...] "Telcom" [...] (a serial terminal emulator program).|$|E
5000|$|With its proven design, the <b>VideoTex</b> <b>terminal</b> {{contains}} all the basic components for a general-purpose home computer. The internal modem was removed, and I/O ports for cassette storage, serial I/O, and joysticks were provided. An expansion connector {{was added to}} {{the right side of the}} case for future enhancements and program cartridges ("Program Paks"), and a RAM button (a sticker indicating the amount of installed memory in the machine) covers the hole where the Modem's LED [...] "DATA" [...] indicator had been. On July 31, 1980, Tandy announced the TRS-80 Color Computer. Sharing the same case, keyboard, and layout as the AgVision/VideoTex terminals, at first glance it would be hard to tell the TRS-80 Color Computer from its predecessors.|$|E
