50|$|Vacuum <b>variable</b> <b>capacitors</b> are {{generally}} more expensive than air <b>variable</b> <b>capacitors.</b> This is primarily due to their design and the materials used. Although most use copper and glass, some may use other materials such as ceramics and metals such as gold and silver. Vacuum variables also vary in adjustment mechanisms.|$|R
25|$|Vibrating reed electrometers use a <b>variable</b> <b>capacitor</b> formed {{between a}} moving {{electrode}} (in {{the form of}} a vibrating reed) and a fixed input electrode. As the distance between the two electrodes varies, the capacitance also varies and electric charge is forced {{in and out of the}} capacitor. The alternating current signal produced by the flow of this charge is amplified and used as an analogue for the DC voltage applied to the capacitor. The DC input resistance of the electrometer is determined solely by the leakage resistance of the capacitor, and is typically extremely high, (although its AC input impedance is lower).|$|E

50|$|When {{compared}} to other <b>variable</b> <b>capacitors,</b> vacuum <b>variables</b> {{tend to be more}} precise and more stable. This is due to the vacuum itself. Because of the sealed chamber, the dielectric constant remains the same over a wider range of operating conditions.

2500|$|The {{synchronous}} condenser's {{installation and}} operation are identical to large electric motors. Its principal advantage is {{the ease with}} which the amount of correction can be adjusted; it behaves like a <b>variable</b> <b>capacitor.</b> Unlike capacitors, the amount of reactive power supplied is proportional to voltage, not the square of voltage; this improves voltage stability on large networks. [...] Synchronous condensers are often used in connection with high-voltage direct-current transmission projects or in large industrial plants such as steel mills.|$|E
2500|$|By varying {{either the}} {{inductor}} (L) or the capacitance (C), the circuit {{can be adjusted}} to different frequencies. [...] In inexpensive sets, the inductor was made variable via a spring contact pressing against the windings that could slide along the coil, thereby introducing a larger or smaller number of turns of the coil into the circuit. Thus the inductance could be varied, [...] "tuning" [...] the circuit to the frequencies of different radio stations. Alternatively, a <b>variable</b> <b>capacitor</b> is used to tune the circuit. [...] Some modern crystal sets use a ferrite core tuning coil, in which a ferrite magnetic core is moved {{into and out of}} the coil, thereby varying the inductance by changing the magnetic permeability (this eliminated the less reliable mechanical contact).|$|E

Low cost <b>variable</b> <b>capacitors</b> squeeze together alternating layers of aluminum and plastic with a screw. Electrical control of capacitance is achievable with varactors (or varicaps), which are reverse-biased semiconductor diodes whose depletion region width varies with applied voltage. They are used in phase-locked loops, amongst other applications.|$|R
25|$|Capacitors {{are divided}} into two {{mechanical}} groups: Fixed capacitors with fixed capacitance values and <b>variable</b> <b>capacitors</b> with <b>variable</b> (trimmer) or adjustable (tunable) capacitance values.|$|R
2500|$|To {{receive a}} radio signal, a {{suitable}} antenna is required. [...] The {{output of the}} antenna may be very small, often only a few microvolts. The signal from the antenna is tuned and may be amplified in a so-called radio frequency (RF) amplifier, although this stage is often omitted. One or more tuned circuits at this stage block frequencies that are {{far removed from the}} intended reception frequency. In order to tune the receiver to a particular station, the frequency of the local oscillator is controlled by the tuning knob (for instance). Tuning of the local oscillator and the RF stage may use a <b>variable</b> <b>capacitor,</b> or varicap diode. The tuning of one (or more) tuned circuits in the RF stage must track the tuning of the local oscillator.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{widespread}} use of synthesizers, in order to pick up stations on different frequencies, radio and television receivers relied on manual tuning of a local oscillator, which used a resonant circuit composed of an inductor and capacitor, or sometimes resonant transmission lines; to determine the frequency. The receiver was adjusted to different frequencies by either a <b>variable</b> <b>capacitor,</b> or a switch which chose the proper tuned circuit for the desired channel, such as with the turret tuner commonly used in television receivers prior to the 1980s. [...] However the resonant frequency of a tuned circuit is not very stable; [...] variations in temperature and aging of components caused frequency drift, causing the receiver to drift off the station frequency. Automatic frequency control (AFC) solves some of the drift problem, but manual retuning was often necessary. Since transmitter frequencies are stabilized, an accurate source of fixed, stable frequencies in the receiver would solve the problem.|$|E
2500|$|The dual of a RC Cauer {{network is}} a LR Cauer network which is {{required}} for the Z' impedance as shown in the example. [...] Adjustment is a bit problematic with this equaliser. [...] In order to maintain the constant resistance, the pairs of components C1/L1', C2/L2' etc., must remain dual impedances as the component is adjusted, so both parts of the pair must be adjusted together. [...] With the Zobel Bode equaliser, this is a simple matter of ganging two pots together - a component configuration available off-the-shelf. [...] Ganging together a <b>variable</b> <b>capacitor</b> and inductor is not, however, a very practical solution. [...] These equalisers tend to be [...] "hand built", one solution being to select the capacitors on test and fit fixed values according to the measurements and then adjust the inductors until the required match is achieved. [...] The furthest element of the ladder from the driving point is equalising the lowest frequency of interest. [...] This is adjusted first as it will also have an effect on higher frequencies and from there progressively higher frequencies are adjusted working along the ladder towards the driving point.|$|E

2500|$|To {{suppress}} the unwanted image, the tuning of the RF {{stage and the}} LO may need to [...] "track" [...] each other. In some cases, a narrow-band receiver can have a fixed tuned RF amplifier. In that case, only the local oscillator frequency is changed. In most cases, a receiver's input band is wider than its IF center frequency. For example, a typical AM broadcast band receiver covers 510kHz to 1655kHz (a roughly 1160kHz input band) with a 455kHz IF frequency; an FM broadcast band receiver covers 88MHz to 108MHz band with a 10.7MHz IF frequency. In that situation, the RF amplifier must be tuned so the IF amplifier does not see two stations at the same time. If the AM broadcast band receiver LO were set at 1200kHz, it would see stations at both 745kHz (1200455kHz) and 1655kHz. Consequently, the RF stage must be designed so that any stations that are twice the IF frequency away are significantly attenuated. The tracking {{can be done with}} a multi-section <b>variable</b> <b>capacitor</b> or some varactors driven by a common control voltage. An RF amplifier may have tuned circuits at both its input and its output, so three or more tuned circuits may be tracked. In practice, the RF and LO frequencies need to track closely but not perfectly.|$|E
