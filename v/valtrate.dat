40|$|SUMMARY. The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{isolation}} and identification of three valepotriate hydrines that are first reported in Valeriana pavonii Poepp. & Endl. (Valerianaceae), which were obtained from a dichloromethane fraction showing anticonvulsant activity in vivo. The isolation and purification of dichloromethane fraction {{was carried out by}} chromatographic techniques. The compounds were identified by comparison of their 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra with previously published data in scientific literature. Maximal electroshock seizure was used as in vivo pharmacological test, additionally in vitro GABA-A/BDZ-binding site studies were performed. Three vale-potriate hydrines: <b>valtrate</b> acetoxyhydrine (1), <b>valtrate</b> isovaleroyloxyhydrine (2) and <b>valtrate</b> chlorohydrine (3), were isolated from a dichloromethane fraction that offered 90 % protection against crisis-like tonic-clonic seizures in an in vivo pharmacological maximal electroshock seizure (MES) test in mice (35 mg/kg, p. o.). Ac-cording to an in vitro GABA-A/BDZ binding site test, the mechanism of action for these compounds does not in-volve binding to the GABA-A receptor. These compounds are reported in this species for the first time. The vale-potriate hydrines isolated from V. pavonii could be active metabolites of this species with anticonvulsant proper...|$|E
40|$|The {{chloroform}} extract of Valeriana wallichii (V. wallichii) rhizomes {{was investigated}} to elucidate the structures responsible for reported antileishmanial activity. Besides bornyl caffeate (1, already {{been reported by}} us previously), bioassay-guided fractionation resulted in two additional cinnamic acid derivatives 2 – 3 with moderate leishmanicidal activity. The structure of a novel nepetolactone derivative 4 having a cinnamic acid moiety was elucidated by means of spectral analysis. To {{the best of our}} knowledge villoside aglycone (5) was isolated from this plant for the first time. The bioassay-guided fractionation yielded two new (compounds 6 – 7) and two known <b>valtrates</b> (compounds 8 – 9) with leishmanicidal potential against Leishmania major (L. major) promastigotes. In addition, β-bisabolol (10), α-kessyl alcohol (11), valeranone (12), bornyl isovalerate (13) and linarin- 2 -O-methylbutyrate (14) were identified. This is the first report on the isolation of 4 '-demethylpodophyllotoxin (15), podophyllotoxin (16) and pinoresinol (17) in V. wallichii. In total thirteen known and four new compounds were identified from the extract and their cytotoxic and antileishmanial properties were evaluated...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} some Iranian wild species of Valerianaceae with respect to their contents of valepotriates. Identification of these compounds which are known as reliable markers in Valerianaceae family was achieved using TLC and UV-spectrophotometry methods. Valepotriates makes substantial contribution to the sedative effect of valerian. Separation of these compounds was performed by TLC using a ternary mobile phase of toluene-ethyl acetate - methyl ethyl ketone (80 : 15 : 5 v/v) on silica gel HF 254 + 366 plates. Separated bands were observed in ultraviolet light at 254 nm. For bands revelation, 2, 4 - dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) solution spray was used at visible light. For the quantitative determination of valepotriates a standardized product (Valmane ®) was used to plot two calibration curves. One calibration curve was drawn in the concentration range of 5 - 156 mg L - 1 for determination of <b>valtrate</b> + acevaltrate amounts. The second one was linear in the range of 5 - 52 mg L - 1 for didrovaltrate quantification. The qualitative and quantitative determinations were carried out in all organs of Valeriana sisymbriifolia Vahl, Valeriana alliariifolia Adams and Centranthus longiflorus Stev. (Iranian wild plant species) and commercial Valeriana officinalis L. sample. Results showed that didrovaltrate amounts (dry weight basis) ranged from 0. 13 % in inflorescence of V. alliariifolia to 3. 51 % in leaf of C. longiflorus. Also acevaltrate + <b>valtrate</b> contents varied from minimum 0. 06 % in stem of V. sisymbriifolia to maximum 10. 85 % in root of V. alliariifolia. Valepotriates contents in these species were compared to those of commercial Valeriana officinalis L. root and rhizome samples (didrovaltrate 1. 99 - 3. 23 %, <b>valtrate</b> + acevaltrate 5. 1 - 9. 26 %) ...|$|E
30|$|According to Khosroushahi et al. (2006), the {{combination}} of elicitors and secondary signaling molecules often appears to be very effective in secondary metabolite accumulation in larger quantities. Cui et al. (2012) highlighted the importance of synergism of two elicitors on increased <b>valtrate</b> production in the adventitious root cultures of Valeriana amurensis. Recently, Largia et al. (2015) also reported a spectacular improvement in bacoside A elicited {{by a combination of}} 25  μM MJ and 25  μM SA for about 3  weeks. The combined application of MJ, SA, and yeast extract resulted in the increased production of rosmarinic acid (twofold) in the whole plant culture of Solenostemon scutellarioides (Sahu et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|Many {{proteins}} are transported {{from the}} nucleus to the cytoplasm by the exportin CRM 1, which recognizes cargo proteins through a leucine rich nuclear export signal (NES). This nuclear export {{process can be}} inhibited by several small molecules, both natural products and fully synthetic compounds. The structural basis for the inhibition of nuclear export by leptomycin (LMB) based on disruption of the protein/protein interaction between CRM 1 and cargo proteins is discussed. The chemistry and inhibition of nucleocytoplasmic transport of leptomycin, anguinomycin and derivatives, goniothalamin, JBIR- 02, <b>valtrate,</b> dihydrovaltrate, ACA, peumusolide A and several synthetic compounds is presented. Consequences {{for the design of}} nuclear export inhibitors are discussed, and the potential of these compounds as anticancer agents is evaluated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{efficient}} regeneration system via adventitious shoot formation {{was developed}} in Valeriana officinalis, an important medicinal species. Regeneration response was significantly influenced by the type and concentrations of plant growth regulators as well as callus morphology. Optimum values for adventitious shoot–buds induction in both leaf and petiole explants were obtained when organogenic calli with compact, nodular and yellowish green phenotype was cultured in MS medium supplemented with 9. 30 μM Kn and 2. 26 μM 2, 4 -D. Well-developed shoots was achieved on a hormone-free half strength (1 / 2) MS basal medium. In vitro rooting of elongated shoots was tried on 1 / 2 MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) or indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA). IBA at a concentration of 2. 46 μM {{was found to be}} the best rooting treatment, which promoted the highest frequency of rooting (98 %). Successful acclimatization of rooted plantlets was achieved in potting medium containing 5 : 1 mixture of peat and perlite with 95. 34 % survival rate. The contents of <b>valtrate</b> and valerenic acid in biomass extracts from petiole-derived plants were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than leaf-derived plants as well as the seed-raised field-grown plants. Maximum <b>valtrate</b> (6. 98 mgg− 1 DW) and valerenic acids (3. 02 mgg− 1 DW) contents were quantified in root tissue of petiole-derived plants raised on medium with higher concentration of Kn (9. 30 μM) in combination with 2. 26 μM 2, 4 -D. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis indicated no evidence of genetic variation in the tissue culture-raised plants. The results suggest that the tissue culture-raised V. officinalis plants are capable of producing higher content of secondary metabolites under optimum in vitro conditions than that under natural wild growth conditions...|$|E
40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatographic method combined with {{diode array detection}} is described by which the valerian constituents <b>valtrate,</b> isovaltrate, acevaltrate, didrovaltrate, isovaleroxyhydroxydidrovaltrate, valerenic acid, hydroxyvalerenic acid and acetoxyvalerenic acid, {{as well as the}} valepotriate decomposition products baldrinal and homobaldrinal, can be separated and identified simultaneously. Using this procedure, roots of Valeriana officinalis, which are used for the production of phytomedicines, were analysed. The influence of different ethanol:water mixtures, used as extraction liquid, on the composition of extracts of V. officinalis is reported. The analytical procedure was also applied to a number of valerian-containing phytomedicines available on the Dutch market. In order to study the stability of the valepotriates and the formation of their decomposition product(s), samples of freshly prepared valerian tinctures were analysed after being stored at 4, 20, and 36 degrees C for up to one month...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative stress {{has been}} {{associated}} with diverse diseases, including obesity, cancer and neurodegeneration. In fact, Valeriana jatamansi Jones (valerian) and its extracts possess strong antioxidant activities that extend their application in clinical practice to the treatment of these illnesses, even though the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Iridoid valepotriate, a characteristic iridoid ester in valerian with poor chemical stability, possesses considerable antioxidant components. The original compounds and their degradation products have been found to exhibit strong antioxidant activities. However, the relationship between their structure and antioxidant effects and the mechanism underlying their oxidation resistance remain unclear. A forced degradation study using three iridoid valepotriates (<b>valtrate,</b> acevaltrate and 1 -β acevaltrate) was performed in this work, and the structures of their degradation products were estimated by TLC-MS and LC-MS. Comparison of the antioxidant activities of the iridoid valepotriates before and after forced degradation revealed that degradation reduced the activities of the iridoid valepotriates in free radical scavenging and cytotoxic and cell apoptosis tests. The results suggested that the oxirane nucleus is important for defining the antioxidant profile of iridoid valepotriate. We uncovered possible mechanisms that could explain the antioxidant activities, including the generation of two hydroxyl groups through intramolecular transfer of an H• from an oxirane ring and a reduction in ROS levels through interactions with GABAergic signalling pathways...|$|E
40|$|Underground {{parts of}} three Valeriana species, namely V. officinalis L. s. l., V. wallichii DC. (V. {{jatamansi}} Jones), and V. edulis Nutt. ex Torr & Gray ssp. procera (H. B. K.) F. G. Meyer (V. mexicana DC.), {{are used in}} phytotherapy because of their mild sedative properties. Characteristic constituents of these species, which are regarded also as the active principles, were tested for cytotoxicity against GLC(4), a human small-cell lung cancer cell line, and against COLO 320, a human colorectal cancer cell line, using the microculture tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Valepotriates of the diene type (<b>valtrate,</b> isovaltrate and acevaltrate) displayed the highest cytotoxicity, with IC 50 values of 1 - 6 mu M, following continuous incubation. The monoene type valepotriates (didrovaltrate and isovaleroxyhydroxydidrovaltrate) were 2 - to 3 -fold less toxic. Baldrinal and homobaldrinal, decomposition products of valepotriates, were 10 - to 30 -fold less toxic than their parent compounds. Isovaltral had a higher cytotoxicity than its parent compound isovaltrate. Valerenic acids (valerenic acid, acetoxyvalerenic acid, hydroxyvalerenic acid and methyl valerenate), which are characteristic for V. officinalis, had a low toxicity with IC 50 values between 100 and 200 mu M. Freshly prepared and stored tinctures, prepared from roots and rhizomes of the three valerian species, were analysed for valepotriates, baldrinals and valerenic acids, and also tested for cytotoxicity. There was a clear relationship between the valepotriate contents of the freshly prepared tinctures and their toxicity. Upon storage, valepotriates decomposed, which was reflected in a significant reduction of the cytotoxic effect...|$|E
40|$|Steroids {{are one of}} the {{essential}} classes of bioactive compounds and are involved in many biological functions which include their role as signaling compounds, the alteration of membrane fluidity and the regulation of a variety of metabolic processes. In order to identify novel compounds with beneficial pharmacological action, the synthesis of modified steroids is gaining much attention in recent years. Among those analogs, azasteroids {{are one of the}} most important classes which display a variety of biological activities, often free from undesirable side effects. The challenges in the synthesis of steroids, particularly azasteroids, and the potential of azasteroids as novel drugs has prompted numerous investigations in this field. The synthetic methods leading to steroidal derivatives (azasteroids) with one or more nitrogen atoms are very limited. Generally, oxidative cleavage of the steroidal rings is needed to introduce nitrogen atom(s) in order to synthesize azasteroids. In the first part of this dissertation, explorations into the synthetic methods needed for making a new steroidal A-ring or seco A-ring on a tricyclic benz[e]indenedione (a dimer compound obtained in connection with continued work on the study of anhydrobases of the isoxazole series) were pursued. In this process, a series of three tricyclic hydrazone compounds have been designed and synthesized to mimic the tetracyclic rigid core structure of azasteroids. We are eager to ascertain if these compounds possesses any interesting biological properties. In continued research on the synthesis of azulenyl and pseudoazulenyl nitrones, (to target ROS generation at the site of mitochondria), the second part of this research was aimed at the synthesis of cationic pseudoazulenyl nitrones with mitochondriotropic properties. Several pseudoazulenyl nitrone derivatives were synthesized using the natural compound <b>valtrate,</b> obtained from the roots of Centranthus ruber. Unfortunately, the attempts made to convert these compounds into the corresponding cationic pseudoazulenyl nitrones failed. However, an interesting pseudoazulenyl dinitrone molecule bearing an imidazole group was prepared. Also, a pseudoazulenyl mono nitrone compound with an electron donating group was synthesized by leaving a highly reactive aldehyde functionality intact for further use in synthetic study...|$|E
40|$|Free {{radicals}} {{have been}} implicated in various pathological conditions such as, stroke, aging and ischemic heart disease (IHD), as well as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease. The role of antioxidants in protection from {{the harmful effects of}} free radicals has long been recognized. Trapping extremely reactive free radicals and eliminating them from circulation {{has been shown to be}} effective in animal models. Nitrone-based free radical traps have been extensively explored in biological systems. Examples include nitrones such as PBN, NXY- 059, MDL- 101, 002, DMPO and EMPO. However, these nitrones have extremely high oxidation potentials as compared to natural antioxidants such as Vitamin E (á-tocopherol), and glutathione. Becker et al. (1995) synthesized novel azulenyl nitrones, which were shown to have oxidation potentials much lower than that of any of the previously reported nitrone based spin traps. Another azulenyl nitrone derivative, stilbazulenyl nitrone (STAZN), was shown to have an even lower oxidation potential within the range of natural antioxidants. STAZN, a second generation free radical trap, was found to be markedly superior than the two most studied nitrones, PBN and NXY- 059, in animal models of cerebral ischemia and in an in vitro assay of lipid peroxidation. In this study, a third generation azulenyl nitrone was synthesized with an electron donating group on the previously synthesized STAZN derivative with the aim to lower the oxidation potential even more. Pseudoazulenes, because of the presence of an annular heteroatom, have been reported to possess even lower oxidation potential than that of the azulenyl counterpart. Therefore, pseudoazulenyl nitrones were synthesized for the first time by extracting and elaborating <b>valtrate</b> from the roots of Centranthus ruber (Red valerian or Jupiter’s beard). Several pseudoazulenyl nitrones were synthesized by using a facile experimental protocol. The physical and biological properties of these pseudoazulenyl nitrones can be easily modified by simply changing the substituent on the heteroatom. Cyclic voltammetry experiments have shown that these pseudoazulenyl nitrones do indeed have low oxidation potentials. The oxidation potential of these nitrones was lowered even more by preparing derivatives bearing an electron donating group at the 3 -position of the five membered ring of the pseudoazulenyl nitrone...|$|E
