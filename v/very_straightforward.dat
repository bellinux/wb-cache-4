5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of Riki Naoe, the protagonist of Little Busters!. He is seen as weak due to his girlish {{appearance}} and physical build but is <b>very</b> <b>straightforward</b> and has more common sense than most of his friends. He {{is a member of}} a group of friends called the Little Busters, which originally consisted of four members, but expanded to five with Riki during his childhood. The leader of the Little Busters is Kyousuke Natsume, who is the eldest member. He often comes up with absurd ideas, but almost always follows up with a reasonable explanation along with it.|$|E
5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of Tomoya Okazaki, the protagonist of Clannad. Tomoya has been labeled a delinquent; at the {{beginning}} of the story, he even expresses hatred toward the city he has lived in all his life where Clannad is set. He is <b>very</b> <b>straightforward</b> in his comments to others and will not hesitate to speak his mind, even if he comes off as rude during such times. Despite this, Tomoya is very loyal to his friends, and has been known to dedicate himself for those around him in need of help or support. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them.|$|E

25|$|Ling Hau – Hau is a 57-year-old {{woman and}} she is the leading lady of the Tong family. Although she is a loving woman, she is {{extremely}} smart and honest and can tell who is a good person and who is a bad person. She is powerful and strong in her ways and {{would do anything to}} keep the Tong family running smoothly with smiles on their faces. She foresees Kam's plotting antics and thus she kicks her out. During her declining health and final days of life, she spent them with her family in a happy manner. Even on her death bed, she was <b>very</b> <b>straightforward</b> in her act of not letting Kam back into her family.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} Test, played at Edgbaston, Hobbs opened the batting with MacLaren but was dismissed, {{from the first}} ball he received, by Charlie Macartney for a duck. However, the match was a low-scoring one on a pitch which made batting difficult, and Australia left England needing 105 to win. The task was not easy in the conditions, but Hobbs, this time opening the batting with C. B. Fry, hit 62 not out. He scored quickly off all the bowlers and England passed the target without losing a wicket. This innings meant that he had scored 919 runs {{before the end of}} May, but he failed to emulate W. G. Grace's {{achievement}} of scoring 1,000 runs in May when Nottinghamshire batted throughout the day when Surrey played them on 31 May. England lost the second Test by nine wickets, their team much changed to the bafflement of critics and spectators, and Hobbs scored just 19 and 9. The home side also lost the third Test. Hobbs scored 12 and 30, the latter the highest score of the innings, but was involved in controversy in the first innings when he appeared to change his mind when about to walk off after apparently hitting his own wicket. The umpire ruled him not out, to the fury of the Australians who loudly protested for some time. Hobbs was out to a <b>very</b> <b>straightforward</b> delivery almost immediately after; some critics, including the Australian captain, believed he allowed himself to be dismissed because he thought the umpire was wrong, but Hobbs later wrote that the incident unsettled him and he lost concentration.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to afford}} the asking price, and {{concerned}} that, ostensibly because of the former private owner's tax concerns, Witten refused to reveal the provenance of the map, Yale contacted another alumnus, Paul Mellon, who agreed to buy it (for a price later stated to be about $300,000) and donate it to the university {{if it could be}} authenticated. Recognizing its potential importance as the earliest map unambiguously showing America, Mellon insisted that its existence be kept secret until a scholarly book had been written about it. Even the three authors of the book were chosen from among the small number of people who had seen the map before Mellon bought it—two British Museum curators and Marston. Only one of them, Dr. Raleigh Ashlin Skelton, keeper of the Museum's map collection, had significant expertise relevant to the problems posed by the map (his colleague George Painter, the first person to whom Davis had shown the map in 1957, was brought in for the transcription and translation of the Relation) and the secrecy almost completely ruled out consultation with specialists. Witten did his best to help during this period, not only answering the authors' questions, but offering suggestions of his own. After years of study, the proofs of the book, The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation, were ready by the end of 1964, and Mellon donated the map to Yale. The book was published, and the map revealed to the world, the day before Columbus Day, 1965. Many academic reviewers of the book took the opportunity to point out evidence that called the map's authenticity into question, so a year later, a Vinland Map Conference was held at the Smithsonian Institution, during which further significant questions were asked, particularly of Witten, who gave <b>very</b> <b>straightforward</b> and helpful answers; but, the proceedings were not published for another five years.|$|E
500|$|Julian Glover as (Lieutenant) Colonel Breen: Roy Ward Baker {{first met}} Glover when he {{directed}} {{him in an}} episode of The Avengers ("Two's a Crowd", 1965). Baker said of Glover's performance, “He turned in a tremendous character, forceful, autocratic but never over the top.” Glover recalled of the role, “I think I was too young for it. [...] I think I played it all right. It was <b>very</b> <b>straightforward.</b> Bit of a stereotype. [...] The obligatory asshole!” ...|$|E

50|$|The {{bone density}} scan {{is known as}} a dual energy X-ray {{absorptiometry}} scan (DEXA or DXA scan). It is a <b>very</b> simple <b>straightforward</b> test, taking less than 15 minutes to perform. It involves taking a specialised X-ray picture of the spine and hips and measuring the bone mineral density and comparing the result to the average value for a young healthy adult in the general population.|$|R
50|$|The POST flow for the PC has {{developed}} from a <b>very</b> simple, <b>straightforward</b> process {{to one that}} is complex and convoluted. During the POST, the BIOS must integrate a plethora of competing, evolving, and even mutually exclusive standards and initiatives for the matrix of hardware and OSes the PC is expected to support, although at most only simple memory tests and the setup screen are displayed.|$|R
500|$|Damon {{prepared}} for the role by a different method than Chastain. He explained, [...] "For me the rehearsal process was sitting with Ridley and going kind of line-by-line and moment-by-moment through the script and playing out a plan of attack for what we wanted each scene to accomplish." [...] Chastain {{prepared for}} her role by meeting with astronauts and scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. She was inspired by astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson, saying [...] "She's very matter of fact, <b>very</b> <b>straightforward.</b> My character {{is dealing with the}} guilt of leaving a crew member behind, but she's still responsible for the lives of five other crew mates. I tried to play her as Tracy would have been in those moments." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea that}} {{climbing}} fiber activity functions as an error signal has been examined in many experimental studies, with some supporting it but others casting doubt. In a pioneering study by Gilbert and Thach from 1977, Purkinje cells from monkeys learning a reaching task showed increased complex spike activity—which {{is known to}} reliably indicate activity of the cell's climbing fiber input—during periods when performance was poor. Several studies of motor learning in cats observed complex spike activity {{when there was a}} mismatch between an intended movement and the movement that was actually executed. Studies of the vestibulo–ocular reflex (which stabilizes the visual image on the retina when the head turns) found that climbing fiber activity indicated [...] "retinal slip", although not in a <b>very</b> <b>straightforward</b> way.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} South African [...] "Freedom Songs" [...] had musical origins in makwaya, or choir music, which {{combined}} elements of Christian hymns with traditional South African musical forms. The songs were often short and repetitive, using a [...] "call-and-response" [...] structure. The music was primarily in indigenous languages such as Xhosa or Zulu, {{as well as}} in English. Melodies used in these songs were often <b>very</b> <b>straightforward.</b> Songs in the movement portrayed basic symbols that were important in South Africa—re-purposing them to represent their message of resistance to apartheid. This trend had begun decades previously when South African jazz musicians had added African elements to jazz music adapted from the United States in the 1940s and 1950s. Voëlvry musicians used rock and roll music to represent traditional Afrikaans songs and symbols. Groups affiliated with the Black Consciousness movement also began incorporating traditional material into their music: the jazz-fusion group Malombo, for example, used traditional rhythms of the Venda people to communicate pride in African culture, often with music that was not explicitly political. While musicians such as Makeba, performing outside South Africa, felt an obligation to write political lyrics, musicians within the country often held that there was no divide between revolutionary music and, for instance, love songs, because the struggle of living a normal life was also a political one. Vusi Mahlasela would write in 1991: [...] "So who are they who say no more love poems now? I want to sing a song of love for that woman who jumped fences pregnant and still gave birth to a healthy child." ...|$|E
50|$|The modern form of {{the school}} was largely founded by Zhang Kongshan in the late 19th century; his inheritors have been very numerous. There are two branches: one branch through Ye Jiafu whose lineage is {{embodied}} by Zeng Chengwei, {{and the other is}} through Gu Yucheng whose lineage was embodied by Gu Meigeng. Today the main representative of the school is Zeng Chengwei, who has a <b>very</b> focused, <b>straightforward</b> style.|$|R
5000|$|He {{is known}} to have worked in Hampshire but details of his later, as of his earlier life, are patchy. It may be that he was taken {{prisoner}} at Rye only a short time after landing in England and that he escaped. In 1583 he was described as a man of [...] "about forty years of age, of average height, with a dark beard, a sprightly look and black eyes. He was a <b>very</b> good controversialist, <b>straightforward,</b> <b>very</b> pious, and pre-eminently a man of hard work. He laboured very strenuously at Winchester and in Hampshire, where he helped many, especially of the poorer classes." ...|$|R
50|$|Kotyonochkin disliked subtext {{and tried}} to create <b>very</b> simple, <b>straightforward</b> scenarios. The main idea of the series was simple; don't hurt the little guy or you will {{yourself}} get into a foolish situation. Because the series was so popular, however, it was often a subject for critical discussion and speculation - namely, that the series represented the struggle between the intelligentsia (Hare) and the working class (Wolf). Aleksey Kotyonochkin dismisses these interpretations as groundless.|$|R
500|$|Kulwicki {{started his}} rookie season in 1986 with Terry. After Terry decided to end support for his racing team mid-season, Kulwicki fielded his own team. He started out as {{essentially}} a one-man team {{in a time when}} other teams had dozens of people in supporting roles. Initially the driver, owner, crew chief, and chief mechanic, Kulwicki had difficulty acquiring and keeping crew members because he found it difficult to trust them to do the job with the excellence that he demanded, and because he was hands on in the maintenance of racecars {{to the point of being}} a [...] "control freak". He sought out crew members who had owned their own racecars, believing they would understand what he was going through: working long hours and performing his own car maintenance with a very limited budget. Notable crew members include his crew chief, Paul Andrews, and future Cup crew chiefs, Tony Gibson and Brian Whitesell. Future crew chief and owner, Ray Evernham, lasted sixweeks with Kulwicki in 1992. Evernham later said, [...] "The man was a genius. There's no question. It's not a matter of people just feeling like he was a genius. That man was a genius. But his personality paid for that. He was very impatient, <b>very</b> <b>straightforward,</b> very cut-to-the-bone." [...] With onecar, twoengines, and twofull-time crew members, Kulwicki won the 1986 Winston Cup Rookie of the Year award. He had competed in 23 of 29events, with fourtop10 finishes, three races not completed (DNF), an average finish of 15.4, and had only one result below 30th place. Kulwicki finished 21st in the Winston Cup points standings for the season.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} on CNN, Powell reiterated {{his support for}} the 2003 decision to invade Iraq in the context of his endorsement of Barack Obama, stating: [...] "My role has been very, <b>very</b> <b>straightforward.</b> I wanted to avoid a war. The president [...] agreed with me. We tried to do that. We couldn't get it through the U.N. and when the president made the decision, I supported that decision. And I've never blinked from that. I've never said I didn't support a decision to go to war." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Anderson has {{elsewhere}} {{stressed that the}} songs are not autobiographical, but [...] "often imaginary situations based on real sentiments, or real situations taken to their logical extreme". When asked about the pervasive {{use of the word}} [...] "he" [...] in his songs, Anderson stated that [...] "too much music is about a <b>very</b> <b>straightforward</b> sense of sexuality... Twisted sexuality is the only kind that interests me. The people that matter in music... don't declare their sexuality. Morrissey never has and he's all the more interesting for that".|$|E

2500|$|Primitive {{recursive}} functions tend {{to correspond}} {{very closely with}} our intuition of what a computable function must be. Certainly the initial functions are intuitively computable (in their very simplicity), and the two operations by which one can create new primitive recursive functions are also <b>very</b> <b>straightforward.</b> However, the set of primitive recursive functions does not include every possible total computable function—this can be seen with a variant of Cantor's diagonal argument. This argument provides a total computable function that is not primitive recursive. A sketch of the proof is as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|If Not Now, When? is {{the seventh}} studio album by American rock band Incubus, {{released}} on July 12, 2011 and {{named after the}} novel by Primo Levi. Preceded by the singles, [...] "Adolescents" [...] and [...] "Promises, Promises", the album represented the band's longest gap between studio albums at the time, and their final full-length release through long-time label Epic Records. Described by guitarist Michael Einziger as [...] "a <b>very</b> <b>straightforward,</b> concise album," [...] If Not Now, When? was recorded {{in the wake of}} an extended hiatus, and produced by frequent collaborator Brendan O'Brien.

2500|$|One of John Smith's main {{incentives}} {{in writing}} about his New World experiences and observances was to promote the colonization of the New World by England. Many promotional writers sugar-coated their depictions of America in order to heighten its appeal, but Smith {{was not one to}} exaggerate the facts. He was <b>very</b> <b>straightforward</b> with his readers about both the dangers and the possibilities of colonization. Instead of proclaiming that there was an abundance of gold in the New World, as many writers did, Smith illustrated that what was truly abundant within America was monetary opportunity in the form of industry.< Smith was realistic about his proposition for colonization and the benefits that it could yield. He recognized that no [...] "other motive [...] wealth…would draw [...] from their ease and humours at home".
