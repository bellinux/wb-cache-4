The AO/ASIF scheme, defining three fracture types (A, B, C), three groups within each type (e. g. A 1, A 2, A 3) and three subgroups within each group (e. g. A 1. 1, A 1. 2, A 1. 3) with increasing severity from A 1. 1 (lowest) to C 3. 3 (highest) was used. The mandible {{is divided into}} two <b>vertical</b> <b>units</b> (I and V), two lateral horizontal units (II and IV) and one central unit (III) comprising the symphyseal and parasymphyseal region. Type A fractures are non-displaced, type B are displaced and type C are multifragmentary/defect injuries. Groups and subgroups are further defined in the classification system. Two classification sessions using semi-automatic software with 7 and 9 surgeons were performed to evaluate 100 fracture cases in the first session and 50 in the second. Inter-observer reliability and individual rater's accuracy were evaluated by kappa coefficient and latent class analysis, respectively. The analysis of inter-observer agreement for the detailed coding showed kappa coefficients around 0. 50 with higher agreement among raters in the <b>vertical</b> <b>units.</b> This system allows standardization of documentation of mandibular fractures, although improvement in the definition of categories and their application is required...|$|R

The observations presented herein were made incidental to another project concerning growth of Haitian children ’ on 7, 409 children from infancy to eighteen years of age (Table i). All measurements were made by two of us (J. F. and W. F.), in col-laboration with several teachers and a clinic nurse. Only those children with recorded birth dates were accepted for the study. Stature was determined to the nearest half inch. The anthropometer used was devised by one of us (E. L. S.).

Wealthy urban children were students in private schools in Port au Prince and Petionville which charged monthly tuition of fifteen dollars or more.
