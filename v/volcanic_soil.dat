5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is a herbivore, feeding {{primarily on}} the short grasses. It forms herds which move about in loose aggregations, the animals being fast runners and extremely wary. The mating season begins {{at the end of}} the rainy season and a single calf is usually born after a gestational period of about eight and a half months. The calf remains with its mother for eight months, after which time it joins a juvenile herd. Blue wildebeest are found in short grass plains bordering bush-covered acacia savannas in southern and eastern Africa, thriving in areas that are neither too wet nor too arid. Three African populations of blue wildebeest take part in a long-distance migration, timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth on the <b>volcanic</b> <b>soil</b> short-grass plains where they can find the nutrient-rich forage necessary for lactation and calf growth.|$|E
5|$|Three African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} {{take part in}} a long-distance migration, timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth on the <b>volcanic</b> <b>soil</b> short-grass plains where they can find the nutrient-rich forage necessary for lactation and calf growth. The timing of the migration in both directions can vary considerably from year to year. At the end of the rainy season, they migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of drinking water. When the rainy season begins again a few months later, the animals trek back to their wet-season range. These movements and access to nutrient rich forage for reproduction allow migratory wildebeest populations to grow to much larger numbers than resident populations. There were many long-distance migratory populations of wildebeest 100 years ago, but currently all but three migrations (Serengeti, Tarangire, and Kafue) have been disrupted, cut off, and lost.|$|E

25|$|Despite hot {{summers and}} {{freezing}} winters with frequent frost presenting a constant challenge to vineyard managers and winemakers, {{the area is}} a successful wine growing region thanks to mountains that encircle three sides of the valley, the cloud cover, and afternoon easterly sea breezes which, during summer, help to mitigate the blazing sunshine and keep humidity moderated on the valley floor. Soil types vary from rich red <b>volcanic</b> <b>soil</b> from the long-extinct volcano of Mount View and sandy loam which benefits most white varieties. The red <b>volcanic</b> <b>soil</b> is found mostly on the southern ridges. However, {{it can be found}} in patches on the valley floor.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} {{range of}} mountains {{is actually a}} discontinuous chain of more than twenty volcanoes, clustered into five groups. The westernmost group, near the Guatemalan border, contains Izalco and Santa Ana, which at 2,365 meters is the highest volcano in El Salvador.

25|$|The {{first major}} {{population}} center {{in this part}} of the Valley of Mexico was Cuicuilco, which was populated as early as 1000 BCE. The current site contains an unusual circular pyramid, and is believed to mimic one of the volcanoes in the area. Cuicuilco was destroyed by a volcanic eruption from Xitle in 100 CE, whose lava flow eventually covered much of the south of the Valley of Mexico, creating what is now called the Pedregales del Sur as well as numerous caves and caverns. This also created areas with rich <b>volcanic</b> <b>soil</b> which would allow for agriculture and repopulation 600 years later.|$|E
25|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi {{are most}} frequent in plants growing on mineral soils, and are of extreme importance for plants growing in nutrient-deficient substrates {{such as in}} <b>volcanic</b> <b>soil</b> and sand dune environments. The populations of AM fungi is greatest in plant communities with high diversity such as tropical rainforests and temperate grasslands where they have many potential host plants and {{can take advantage of}} their ability to colonize a broad host range. There is a lower incidence of mycorrhizal colonization in very arid or nutrient-rich soils. Mycorrhizas have been observed in aquatic habitats; however, waterlogged soils have been shown to decrease colonization in some species.|$|E

25|$|The Andes {{also provide}} a ready source of {{irrigation}} which was historically done in flood plain style. Chilean vineyard owners would dig canals throughout their vineyards and then flood the entire surface area with water allowing some to seep {{into the ground and}} the run off to be funnel away through the canals. This encouraged excessive irrigation and high yields which had a negative effect on quality. During the wine renaissance of the 1980s & 1990s more vineyards converted to drip irrigation system which allowed greater control and helped reduce yields. The soil composition of Chile's vineyards varies from the clay dominated landscapes of Colchagua, which is thus heavily planted with the clay-loving Merlot, to the mixture of loam, limestone and sand found in other regions. In the southern Rapel and parts of Maule, tuffeau soil is present with <b>volcanic</b> <b>soil</b> being found in parts of Curico and Bio-Bio.|$|E

40|$|In this study, an {{application}} {{was carried out}} to determine the <b>Volcanic</b> <b>Soils</b> by using remote sensing. The study area was located on the Golcuk formation in Isparta-Turkey. The thermal bands of Landsat 7 image were used for processing. The implementation of the climate model {{that was based on}} the water index was used in ERDAS Imagine software together with pixel based image classification. Soil Moisture Index (SMI) was modeled by using the surface temperature (Ts) which was obtained from thermal bands and vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 7. Surface moisture values were grouped and classified by using scoring system. Thematic layers were compared together with the field studies. Consequently, different moisture levels for <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils</b> were indicator for determination and separation. Those thermal wavelengths are preferable bands for separation of <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils</b> using moisture and temperature models...|$|R
40|$|The study {{took place}} in the <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils</b> of Mt. Hulu Sabuk in North Lampung Regency, Lampung Province. The {{research}} had been conducted from June to October 2000. The objective of study was to reveal the mineralogical characteristics of <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils,</b> especially in the study area. The methodologyused was transect/landscape analysis by studying of six soil profiles that supported by mineralogical analyses of optical, X-ray diffraction and differential thermal of soil samples. The results of the study showed that opaque minerals and quartz dominate the soil mineralogy of the study area. While the weatherable minerals like volcanic glass, feldspars, amphiboles, and pyroxenes were encountered in small amounts. The secondary minerals of clay fraction were occupied by kaolinite and gibbsite. The characteristics of soil minerals indicated that the <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils</b> in the study area are highly weathered and already developed...|$|R

30|$|Soils {{are formed}} {{primarily}} from andesitic volcanic {{rocks in the}} northern portion of the LTB and granodiorite in the south. Valley bottoms and lower hill slopes are covered with glacial outwash material derived from the parent rock. All soils are coarse textured (< 15 % clay), ranging from gravelly loamy coarse sands (granodiorite) to very cobbly sandy loams (volcanic), and are moderately infertile. Organic matter content in the surface 10 cm depth ranges from 2 % to 6 % for granitic soils and 7 % to 11 % for <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils.</b> Granitic soils are somewhat excessively drained while <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils</b> are moderately well drained. Rock fragment content is relatively high, ranging from 5 % to 30 % on granitic soils and 15 % to > 35 % on the <b>volcanic</b> derived <b>soils.</b> Soil available water-holding capacity is low, ranging from 8 % to 10 % on the granitic soils to 11 % to 15 % on the <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils.</b> Soils mapped on granitic terrain at Bliss, Sugar Pine, and Spooner Lake state parks are mixed, frigid Dystric Xeropsamments. Soils at the Mill Creek site are derived from andesite and are mapped as fine-loamy, isotic, frigid Ultic Palexeralfs.
