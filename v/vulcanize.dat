40|$|Abstract. How to exploiture {{and apply}} {{environmentally}} friendly and low carbon asphalt modifier {{is one of}} technicality problems which are exigent to solved in highway construction. Based on the introduction of <b>vulcanizing</b> process of eucommia ulmoides gum(EUG) and the physical and mechanical properties of <b>vulcanized</b> gum, and the explains of its desirable engineering characteristics {{as well as its}} engineering application foreground. ，the new approach is presented to use modified asphalt which is a blend of <b>vulcanized</b> EUG and asphalt as new pavement materials of highway. With sweep electron microscope（SEM）and analysis on the improvements of the asphalt`s performance, the best crosslinking degree of asphalt modified <b>vulcanized</b> EUG was studied, and the result indicates that <b>vulcanized</b> EUG has a range of the best crosslinking degree. When the crosslinking degree of <b>vulcanized</b> EUG reaches the range, the <b>vulcanized</b> EUG can improve asphalt`s performances in both low temperature and high temperature, which means it is feasible to use <b>vulcanized</b> EUG for asphalt modifying...|$|R

50|$|A steam {{connection}} {{is attached to}} {{each end of the}} assembled hose, and pressurized steam is injected into the hose. This makes the liner swell against the inner jacket and causes the thin sheet of uncured rubber to <b>vulcanize</b> and bond the liner to the inner jacket.|$|E
50|$|The core of {{the balls}} are formed by {{compression}} molding with chemical reactions. First, polybutadiene is mixed with additives, then extruded, pressed using a calender and cut into pieces which are placed in a mold. The mold is subjected to high pressure and high temperature for about 30 minutes, enough time to <b>vulcanize</b> the material.|$|E
50|$|An {{autoclave}} is {{a pressure}} chamber used to carry out industrial processes requiring elevated temperature and pressure different from ambient air pressure. Autoclaves are used in medical applications to perform sterilization and in the chemical industry to cure coatings and <b>vulcanize</b> rubber and for hydrothermal synthesis. They are also used in industrial applications, especially regarding composites, see autoclave (industrial).|$|E

5000|$|The {{water power}} of the Piedmont streams in Northern Delaware led to a {{proliferation}} of companies in the <b>vulcanized</b> fibre business. Over the years, these companies reorganized and merged. In 1922 National <b>Vulcanized</b> Fiber Company emerged as the main competitor to Spaulding Fibre, which had begun developing <b>vulcanized</b> products in Rochester, New Hampshire and Tonawanda, New York, nearly a quarter century after the industry began in Delaware.|$|R
50|$|Ancient Mesoamerican civilizations {{used the}} morning glory species Ipomoea alba {{to convert the}} latex from the Castilla {{elastica}} tree and also the guayule plant to produce bouncing rubber balls. The sulfur in the morning glory's juice served to <b>vulcanize</b> the rubber, a process predating Charles Goodyear's discovery by at least 3,000 years. Aztec priests in Mexico were also known to use the plant's hallucinogenic properties (see Rivea corymbosa).|$|E
50|$|Most sulfur {{produced}} {{is transformed}} into sulfur dioxide, which is further transformed into sulfuric acid, a very common industrial chemical. Other common uses include being a key ingredient of gunpowder and Greek fire, and being used to change soil pH. Sulfur is also mixed into rubber to <b>vulcanize</b> it. Sulfur is used in some types of concrete and fireworks. 60% of all sulfuric acid produced is used to generate phosphoric acid.|$|E
50|$|As the {{material}} further warms during initial {{rotation of the}} serrated disk and the rubber begins to shear, the viscosity lowers and torque required decreases. Eventually, the torque will reach an inflection point, where the rubber begins to <b>vulcanize</b> and torque begins increasing. A shear pin on the machine prevents damage as the testing material stiffens. Comparing the torque versus time curves for different materials allows direct correlation of material viscosity and scorch time.|$|E

(2006) discover that when the <b>vulcanized</b> rubber samples were irradiated by microwave for 10 and 20  s respectively, their temperatures are 26 and 41  °C, and the sulfur chemical bonds in rubber rupture. It is believed that {{the damage to the}} cross-linked network of the <b>vulcanized</b> rubber is largely attributable to the non-thermal effect of microwaves.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vulcanized</b> fibre is a {{laminated}} plastic {{composed of}} only cellulose. The material is a tough, resilient, hornlike {{material that is}} lighter than aluminium, tougher than leather, and stiffer than most thermoplastics. The newer wood-laminating grade of <b>vulcanized</b> fibre is used to strengthen wood laminations used in skis, skateboards, support beams and as a sub-laminate under thin wood veneers.A product very similar to <b>vulcanized</b> fibre is leatheroid. Leatheroid, however, is made using a different chemical process.|$|R

50|$|He {{brought a}} ton of Mexican chicle with him, in hopes of selling it to raise funds to help him return to power in his own country. He persuaded Thomas Adams of Staten Island, New York to buy it. Adams, a {{photographer}} and inventor, intended to <b>vulcanize</b> the chicle {{for use as a}} rubber substitute. Adams' efforts at vulcanization failed, but he noticed that Santa Anna liked to chew the chicle, which the ancient Mayans had done.|$|E
50|$|Rubber {{produced}} {{in this fashion}} has disadvantages. For example, exposure to air causes it to mix with various materials, which is perceptible and can cause rot, {{as well as a}} temperature-dependent stickiness. Industrial treatment was developed to remove the impurities and <b>vulcanize</b> the rubber, a process that eliminated its undesirable qualities. This process gives it superior mechanical properties, and causes it to lose its sticky character, and become stable - resistant to solvents and variations in temperature.|$|E
5000|$|The Rotating disk viscometer, or [...] "Mooney Machine" [...] {{as it is}} {{sometimes}} {{referred to in the}} rubber industry, is the standard viscometer for measuring material viscosity and scorch time for rubber before vulcanization. It was developed in the 1930s by Melvin Mooney. For a specific temperature, scorch time describes {{how long it will take}} the material to <b>vulcanize.</b> For example, a scorch time at ambient temperature indicates the rubber will be able to remain unvulcanized at room temperature for an extended period of time.|$|E

It was indicated that the bonding strength of liner and propellant arrive the highest value 0. 32 MPa when MAPO contents was 3 % {{and there is a}} little effect on bonding strength for <b>vulcanized</b> parameter. Moreover, the bonding strength gets weaker when the content of plasticizer decreases. Significantly, the molecular sieve can improve bonding strength greatly. Compared with other cure agent, TDI was the best <b>vulcanized</b> agent, and when it was used in the <b>vulcanized</b> system, the highest value of bonding strength between liner and propellant could be obtained...|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{companies}} involved in <b>vulcanized</b> fibre development in the Wilmington region were the Nunsuch Fiber Company, American Hard Fiber Company, American <b>Vulcanized</b> Fibre Company, Continental Fibre Co., Diamond State Fibre Co., and Franklin Fibre Company. In the 1965 Post’s Pulp and Paper Directory, National <b>Vulcanized</b> Fibre Co. was listed as having two mills' producing rag paper for <b>vulcanized</b> fibre. They were at Newark, producing 15 tons a day; and Yorklyn, producing 18 tons a day. This compares with Spaulding Fibre’s Tonawanda plant, then producing 40 tons a day (Post’s directory). The competitors also produced bakelite, but marketed them under different names: Spaulding’s was Spauldite and National’s brand was Phenolite and Iten Industries' Resiten or Itenite.|$|R
40|$|To obtain {{thermoplastic}} polyurethane (TPU) {{with low}} hardness, dynamically <b>vulcanized</b> TPU/polybutadiene rubber(BR) (70 / 30) blends were prepared. The effect of dicumyl peroxide (DCP) content and stabilizers on the tensile strength and {{elongation at break}} of the dynamically <b>vulcanized</b> blends was examined. The tensile strength and elongation at break of the dynamically <b>vulcanized</b> blends decrease with increasing content of DCP. The addition of optimal content of stabilizer leads to the improvement of tensile strength and elongation at break of the blends. Also, the effect of sulfur cure systems and accelerators on the tensile strength and elongation of the blends was investigated. The tensile strength and elongation at break of all the dynamically <b>vulcanized</b> TPU/BR (70 / 30) blends using 1 -step processing are not {{higher than those of}} simple TPU/BR (70 / 30) blends. However, the tensile strength and elongation of the dynamically <b>vulcanized</b> blends prepared at 8 min (mixing time) using 2 -step processing are higher than those of the simple blends...|$|R
50|$|In 1884 Montgomery {{received}} a patent for {{a process to}} <b>vulcanize</b> and de-vulcanize India rubber. In 1895 and again in the period 1901 to 1904, Montgomery occasionally supplemented his aeronautical research with work in other branches of science, including electricity, communication, astronomy and mining. In 1895 he received four patents (American, German, British, and Canadian) for improvements in the efficiency of petroleum burning furnaces. In 1897 he took a teaching position at Santa Clara College and directed study of wireless telegraphy with Father Richard Bell. They were first to successfully transmit messages from Santa Clara College to San Francisco. Montgomery also patented two gold concentrator devices to assist miners in extracting gold from beach sands (see patent list).|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} of the process to <b>vulcanize</b> rubber was made by Charles Goodyear in 1838, and was granted a US Patent in 1844. In late 1843, Thomas Hancock filed for a UK patent, which was also granted in 1844, after the Goodyear patent had been granted. In 1852, while traveling in England, Charles Goodyear discovered that Thomas Hancock's company was producing vulcanized rubber and sued. It was discovered that Thomas Hancock had been shown a sample of Goodyear's rubber in 1842, {{but he had not}} been told the process that made it, and that Hancock said that he came up with his process independently. The last of the suits were settled in 1855. Vulcanization stabilized the rubber allowing it to be both durable and flexible. Shortly thereafter, several people expanded on experimentation of rubber coated fabrics.|$|E
5000|$|By far {{the most}} common {{vulcanizing}} methods depend on sulfur. Sulfur, by itself, is a slow vulcanizing agent and does not <b>vulcanize</b> synthetic polyolefins. Even with natural rubber, large amounts of sulfur, as well as high temperatures and long heating periods are necessary and one obtains to an unsatisfactory crosslinking efficiency with unsatisfactory strength and aging properties. Only with vulcanization accelerators can the quality corresponding to today's level of technology be achieved. The multiplicity of vulcanization effects demanded cannot be achieved with one universal substance; {{a large number of}} diverse additives, comprising the [...] "cure package," [...] are necessary. The combined cure package in a typical rubber compound consists of sulfur together with an assortment of compounds that modify the kinetics of crosslinking and stabilize the final product. These additives include accelerators, activators like zinc oxide and stearic acid and antidegradants. The accelerators and activators are catalysts. An additional level of control is achieved by retarding agents that inhibit vulcanization until some optimal time or temperature. Antidegradants are used to prevent degradation of the vulcanized product by heat, oxygen, and ozone.|$|E
50|$|Once the <b>vulcanized</b> fibre is leached {{free of the}} zinc chloride, it is dried to 5 to 6 percent moisture, {{and pressed}} or calendared to flatness. The {{continuous}} process-made <b>vulcanized</b> fibre could then be sheeted or wound up into rolls. The density of the finished <b>vulcanized</b> fibre is 2 to 3 {{times greater than the}} paper from which it starts. The density increase is the result of 10% machine direction shrinkage, 20% cross machine direction shrinkage, and 30% shrinkage in thickness.|$|R

5000|$|With World War I, Germany {{experienced}} a rapid liberalization of sexual values and {{sexually transmitted diseases}} spread rapidly. During this time, the majority of condoms were still made of [...] "skin": chemically treated intestine or bladder. [...] Rubber condoms were also available; they were made by wrapping raw rubber sheets around molds, then dipping them in a solution to <b>vulcanize</b> the rubber. In 1912, Fromm invented the cement dipping method, which made a thinner, seamless condom. [...] Instead of working with rubber as a solid material, it was mixed with gasoline or benzene. This made it a liquid in which molds could be dipped. [...] Fromm patented his invention in 1916. Mass production started in 1922 and was a great success—Fromms Act, as they were called, becoming the first brand-name condoms—which allowed the entrepreneur soon to open up branches in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Poland, and the Netherlands. Fromms became a synonym for condom in Germany. In 1920 Fromm was naturalized a German citizen. In 1928, the first condom vending machines were installed by Fromm's company, but the interior ministry only allowed it to advertise the hygienic advantages of condoms, not the condom's use as a contraceptive, because it feared a further decrease of the birth rate.|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{previous}} model compound study, we investigated the melt reactivity of Si-H and Si-vinyl end-functionalized siloxane oligomers towards polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) {{in the presence of}} platinum(0) -catalyst. We clearly observed grafting of the Si-H functional oligomer onto PBT and have also indications for grafting of the Si-vinyl oligomer. The grafting efficiencies and kinetics of both siloxane model compounds are compared and roughly quantified by infrared spectroscopy. This result indicates that the same reactive groups that are used to <b>vulcanize</b> silicone gums at high temperature {{can also be used to}} favor compatibility with a polyester matrix, opening perspectives toward polyester-siloxane thermoplastic elastomers...|$|E
