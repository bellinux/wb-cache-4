40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the possible effect of rack type on the blastocyst yield of mouse embryo donors. The first phase of the study consisted of housing some mice (group A) in a <b>ventilated</b> <b>rack</b> and others (group B) in a static rack in the same room for 3 d, followed by euthanasia for blastocyst collection and corticosterone assay. Parametric tests were used to compare groups. The number of blastocysts per donor was lower in group A (5. 0 ± 1. 4 blastocysts) than group B (13. 1 ± 3. 7 blastocysts). Mean noise was higher in the <b>ventilated</b> <b>rack</b> (80. 4 dBC) than in the static rack (69. 2 dBC). Serum corticosterone concentrations did not differ between groups. For {{the second phase of the}} study, a third group of mice (group C) was housed in a static rack without a <b>ventilated</b> <b>rack</b> in the same room. The noise level for group C was even lower (45. 18 ± 2. 91 dBC), and the blastocyst count per donor (16. 4 ± 2. 4) was higher than that of group B. The mean noise levels of empty ventilated and static racks differed significantly between groups for 10 different sound frequencies. Plotting mean blastocyst production against mean rack noise revealed a negative linear relationship with good strength of correlation. These results support the earlier observation that decreased blastocyst count occurs following housing of bred C 57 BL/ 6 donor mice in ventilated cages...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} was {{performed}} to determine the vibration levels that were generated in cages on a <b>ventilated</b> <b>rack</b> by common construction equipment in frequency ranges likely to be perceived by humans, rats, and mice. Vibration generated by the <b>ventilated</b> <b>rack</b> blower caused small but significant increases {{in some of the}} abdominal, thoracic, and head resonance frequency ranges (RFR) and sensitivity frequency ranges (SFR) in which each species is most likely to be affected by and perceive vibration, respectively. Vibration caused by various items of construction equipment at 3 ft from the cage were evaluated relative to the RFR and SFR of humans, rats, and mice in 3 anatomic locations. In addition, the vibration levels in the RFR and SFR that resulted from the use of a large jackhammer and were measured at various locations and distances in the facility and evaluated in terms of humans, rats, and mice in 3 anatomic locations. Taken together, the data indicate that a given vibration source generates vibration in frequency ranges that are more likely to affect rats and mice as compared with humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} was {{performed}} to understand the level of sound produced by ventilated racks, animal transfer stations, and construction equipment that mice in ventilated cages hear relative to what humans would hear in the same environment. Although the <b>ventilated</b> <b>rack</b> and animal transfer station both produced sound pressure levels above the ambient level within the human hearing range, the sound pressure levels within the mouse hearing range did not increase above ambient noise from either noise source. When various types of construction equipment were used 3 ft from the <b>ventilated</b> <b>rack,</b> the sound pressure level within the mouse hearing range was increased but {{to a lesser degree}} for each implement than were the sound pressure levels within the human hearing range. At more distant locations within the animal facility, sound pressure levels from the large jackhammer within the mouse hearing range decreased much more rapidly than did those in the human hearing range, indicating that less of the sound is perceived by mice than by humans. The relatively high proportion of low-frequency sound produced by the shot blaster, used without the metal shot that it normally uses to clean concrete, increased the sound pressure level above the ambient level for humans but did not increase sound pressure levels above ambient noise for mice at locations greater than 3 ft from inside of the cage, where sound was measured. This study demonstrates that sound clearly audible to humans in the animal facility may be perceived to a lesser degree or not at all by mice, because of the frequency content of the sound...|$|E
30|$|Mecp 2 -null colony founders were {{obtained}} from The Jackson Lab stock # 003890 in a C 57 BL/ 6 J: 129 /SvJ genetic background. Colony founders were outbred with C 57 BL/ 6 wild-type male for at least eight generations. To generate the conditional KO mice for Mecp 2 in the intestinal epithelium, we bred heterozygous Mecp 2 female mice carrying one of the Mecp 2 allele flanked by loxP sites with the male mice carrying the Cre recombinase protein coding sequence {{under the control of}} Villin promoter. Animals {{were obtained}} from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The mice were bred in the C 57 BL/ 6 J strain for at least eight generations. All mice were housed in <b>ventilated</b> <b>racks</b> under specific-pathogen-free conditions at a room temperature of 20  °C[*]±[*] 2  °C in a 12 / 12  h light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum. All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee regulations. The animal facility of the Centro de Estudios Científicos (CECs) is accredited by AAALAC.|$|R
40|$|Supplementary MaterialSupplementary Material Figure S 1. System for murine {{exposure}} to concentrated ambient PM 2. 5. Mice {{were exposed to}} concentrated ambient PM in a Versatile Aerosol Concentration and Enrichment System (VACES), which concentrates particles to levels � 10 fold higher {{than those in the}} ambient air. The system is comprised of a pump that draws ambient air (100 L/min) from the third floor of an alley in close proximity to several major roadways (Arrow 1 is just distal to the pump). A detailed map of the location can be found using the link below, the closest major roadway prohibits truck traffic. Particles are condensed from the ambient air and resuspended at a higher concentration using the principle of virtual impactors through a 2. 5 µm filter (Arrow 2) before being passed through two dessicators (5 L/min total) into identical murine chambers (food and water available ad libitum) 1, 2. Control animals are housed in an identical chamber where a teflon filter has been placed in the inlet to the chamber (Arrow 3). Particleconcentrations in the chambers are measured using a TSI 3775 particle counter (Arrow 4). Between exposures, mice are housed in microisolation cages in HEPA filtered <b>ventilated</b> <b>racks.</b> Link to map of laboratory location...|$|R
40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} investigate the effect of housing conditions on task performance and corticosterone response. Two groups of male F 344 BNF 1 rats were housed on a <b>ventilated</b> <b>rack</b> with ad libitum access to water and a restricted feeding regime. Group 1 was housed in solid-bottom caging with corn cob bedding, whereas group 2 was housed in wire-bottom caging. After learning an operant task, each rat was exposed to acute restraint followed 48 h later by exposure to continuous light. Corticosterone concentrations were determined before and after exposure to each intervention. Contrary to assumptions, housing did not affect task performance. Baseline corticosterone concentrations were similar for the 2 experimental groups, but corticosterone concentrations were significantly higher for the wire-bottom group than the solid-bottom group immediately after the restraint and remained elevated 2 d later. Corticosterone levels decreased in both groups after exposure to continuous light. Overall, the data indicate that subtle but significant differences occur in responses of rats housed on wire-bottom versus solid-bottom caging when the animals are exposed to acute restraint...|$|E
40|$|Stage {{in which}} DSBs are formed and processed, and strand {{exchange}} intermediates begin to appear. Homolog pairing and SC axial element assembly is initiated. Zygotene Repair of DSBs is ongoing. The number of strand exchange interme-diates declines as cells reach late zygotene. Elaboration of axial elements continues and synapsis between homologous chromo-somes is initiated in early zygotene. Synapsis nears completion at late zygotene stages. Pachytene Strand exchange intermediates are resolved and crossovers are formed. Homologs are completely synapsed during pachytene {{with the exception}} of the nonhomologous axes of the sex chromosomes in males. These chromosomes become sequestered in a proteina-cious chromatin domain, termed the sex body, during pachytene in male meiocytes. Diplotene Homologs desynapse everywhere except at centromeres. Homo-logs remain associated via crossovers. Diakinesis/Metaphase I Chromosomes condense and align on the metaphase plate via spin-dle attachment, prior to segregation of homologs. Mice The generation of Mre 11 ATLD 1 and Nbs 1 DB mice by gene targeting and genotyping methodology have been described previously [S 1, S 2]. For the present studies, mice were housed in <b>ventilated</b> <b>rack</b> caging in a pathogen-free facility and maintained by brother-sister matings.
