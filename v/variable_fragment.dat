50|$|A {{single-chain}} <b>variable</b> <b>fragment</b> (scFv) is {{not actually}} {{a fragment of}} an antibody, but instead is a fusion protein of the variable regions of the heavy (VH) and light chains (VL) of immunoglobulins, connected with a short linker peptide of ten to about 25 amino acids. The linker is usually rich in glycine for flexibility, as well as serine or threonine for solubility, and can either connect the N-terminus of the VH with the C-terminus of the VL, or vice versa.This protein retains the specificity of the original immunoglobulin, despite removal of the constant regions {{and the introduction of}} the linker. The image to the right shows how this modification usually leaves the specificity unaltered.|$|E

This paper deals with a translation that associates equivalence of structures in the k- <b>variable</b> <b>fragments</b> with bisimulation equivalence between derived structures. Apart from a uniform and intuitively appealing treatment of these equivalences, this approach relates some interesting issues for the case of an arbitrary number of variables to the case of just three variables.

We present a characterisation of all the finite <b>variable</b> <b>fragments</b> of DPLE. 1 Introduction In the recent past an interesting shift of perspective has taken place in formal approaches to the semantics of natural language. Traditionally the meaning of a natural language expression was described in terms of truth conditions: to know the meaning of an expression is to know when it is true and when it is false. But in the early eighties so called dynamic approaches to natural language semantics arose which chose to give formal descriptions of the meaning of natural language expressions in terms of procedures. In these approaches interpreting a natural language expression is the same as executing the procedure assigned to it in [...] ...|$|R
