This paper presents <b>vehicle</b> <b>based</b> <b>testing</b> of a model-based controller {{that takes into account}} dynamics of the catalytic converter. By applying such a controller higher efficiency of the catalytic converter under dynamic operation is achieved, which ultimately leads to lower emissions and a possibility to reduce the cost of the system...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{validation}} of small wind turbines has typically followed the simplified load case approach prescribed by IEC 61400 : 2 with {{little in the}} way of validation of the loads with physical testing and measurement of either components or fully operational systems. Recognising potential drawbacks of this approach, Ampair Energy have developed software for full aero-elastic simulation from wind to wire which has been validated against third party simulators. The results of these aero-elastic studies have been used to evaluate the strength and performance of existing products as well as design tools for the development of new products. As with any theoretical calculation, comparison of the results with actual measurements is vital and Ampair Energy Ltd have used <b>vehicle</b> <b>based</b> <b>testing</b> and field measurements to guide the analysis and provide confidence in its predictions...|$|R

For E85 (85% ethanol), the effect becomes significant. E85 produces lower mileage than gasoline, and requires more frequent refueling.

40|$|Airframe-integrated {{scramjet}} engine {{tests have}} 8 completed at Mach 7 in the NASA Langley 8 -Foot High Temperature Tunnel under the Hyper-X program. These tests provided critical engine data {{as well as}} design and database verification for the Mach 7 flight tests of the Hyper-X research vehicle (X- 43), which will provide the first-ever airframe- integrated scramjet flight data. The first model tested was the Hyper-X Engine Model (HXEM), and the second was the Hyper-X Flight Engine (HXFE). The HXEM, a partial-width, full-height engine that is mounted on an airframe structure to simulate the forebody features of the X- 43, was tested to provide data linking flowpath development databases to the complete airframe-integrated three-dimensional flight configuration and to isolate effects of ground testing conditions and techniques. The HXFE, an exact geometric representation of the X- 43 scramjet engine mounted on an airframe structure that duplicates the entire three-dimensional propulsion flowpath from the vehicle leading edge to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>base,</b> was <b>tested</b> to verify the complete design as it will be flight tested.

40|$|Kalman filter (KF) uses {{measurement}} updates {{to correct}} system states error and {{to limit the}} errors in navigation solutions. However, only when the system dynamic and measurement models are correctly defined, and the noise statistics for the process are completely known, KF can optimally estimate a system’s states. Without measurement updates, Kalman filter’s prediction diverges; therefore the performance of an integrated GPS/INS navigation system may degrade rapidly when GPS signals are unavailable. This paper presents a neural network (NN) aided Kalman filtering method to improve navigation solutions of integrated GPS/INS navigation system. In the proposed loosely coupled GPS/INS navigation system, extended KF (EKF) estimates the INS measurement errors, plus position, velocity and attitude errors, and provides precise navigation solutions while GPS signals are available. At the same time, multi-layer NN is trained to map the vehicle manoeuvre with INS prediction errors during each GPS epoch, which is the input of the EKF. During GPS signal blockages, the NN {{can be used to}} predict the INS errors for EKF measurement updates, and in this way to improve navigation solutions. The principle of this hybrid method and the NN design are presented. Land <b>vehicle</b> <b>based</b> field <b>test</b> data are processed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. </div...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{mathematical}} modeling of a <b>vehicle</b> crash <b>test</b> <b>based</b> on a single-mass is studied. The model under consideration {{consists of a}} single-mass coupled with a spring and/or a damper. The parameters for the spring and damper are obtained by analyzing the measured acceleration {{in the center of}} gravity of the vehicle during a crash. A model with a nonlinear spring and damper is also proposed and the parameters will be optimized with different damper and spring characteristics and optimization algorithms. The optimization algorithms used are interior-point and firefly algorithm.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a robotic driver for the automation of dynamometer <b>based</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>testing.</b> The aim is to successfully follow industry standard test cycles used for emissions testing and produce repeatable results. Success will be measured by not exceeding the limits set for human drivers for a successful test. The design of this robotic driver is unique; it uses a single linear motion to actuate the brake and throttle pedals controlled by two cascaded PID controllers (vehicle speed and pedal actuator position). A full SIMULINK model has been created and used for simultaion and rapid control prototyping using dSPACE. The system has been developed and tested from simulation through to actual dynamometer testing. Test results show that by time-shifting the drive cycle 2 seconds forward, the robotic driver successfully adhered to the ADR 37 / 01 standard, and produced repeatable results. Further development is needed to improve the performance and overcome current system limitations such as motor saturation and accelerator pedal stick-slip. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this study, two battery {{models for}} a {{high-power}} lithium ion (Li-Ion) cell were compared {{for their use}} in hybrid electric vehicle simulations {{in support of the}} U. S. Department of Energy's Hybrid Electric Vehicle Program. Saft America developed the high-power Li-Ion cells as part of the U. S. Advanced Battery Consortium/U. S. Partnership for a New Generation of <b>Vehicles</b> programs. <b>Based</b> on <b>test</b> data, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed a resistive equivalent circuit battery model for comparison with a 2 -capacitance battery model from Saft. The Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR) was used to compare the predictions of the two models over two different power cycles. The two models were also compared to and validated with experimental data for a US 06 driving cycle. The experimental voltages on the US 06 power cycle fell between the NREL resistive model and Saft capacitance model predictions. Generally, the predictions of the two models were reasonably close to th e experimental results; the capacitance model showed slightly better performance. Both battery models of high-power Li-Ion cells could be used in ADVISOR with confidence as accurate battery behavior is maintained during vehicle simulations...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a method for}} unmanned aerial <b>vehicle</b> <b>based</b> structure from motion mapping and show {{it to be a}} viable option for large scale, high resolution terrain modeling. Current methods of large scale terrain modeling can be cost and time prohibitive. We present a method for integrating low cost cameras and unmanned aerial vehicles for the purpose of 3 D terrain mapping. Using structure from motion, aerial images taken of the landscape can be reconstructed into 3 D models of the terrain. This process is well suited for use on unmanned aerial vehicles due to the light weight and low cost of equipment. We discuss issues of ﬂight path planning and propose an algorithm to assist in the generation of these paths. The structure from motion mapping process is experimentally evaluated in three distinct environments: ground <b>based</b> <b>testing</b> on man-made environments, ground <b>based</b> <b>testing</b> on natural environments, and airborne testing on natural environments.
