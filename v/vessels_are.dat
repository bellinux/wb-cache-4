50|$|State of Washington {{was built}} in 1889 by John J. Holland in Tacoma, Washington. From 1889 to 1902 the <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> placed on the Seattle-Bellingham route. From 1902 to 1907, the <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> {{operated}} as a standby boat on the Tacoma-Seattle run. Later, the <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> assigned to the Hood Canal route. In 1913, the <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> transferred to the Columbia River to be operated by the Shaver Transportation Company. In 1915 the <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> converted to a towboat. In 1921, the <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> destroyed by a boiler explosion. Six crewmen were injured and one man was killed.|$|R
50|$|Fewer {{and fewer}} <b>vessels</b> <b>were</b> being fitted out, {{so that by}} 1843 only nine <b>vessels</b> <b>were</b> {{clearing}} for the southern fishery. In 1859 the last cargoes of whale oil from British <b>vessels</b> <b>were</b> landed in London.|$|R
50|$|The <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} Korea. The overall {{length of the}} <b>vessel</b> <b>is</b> 249 metres.|$|R
5|$|The world's busiest bridge, the George Washington Bridge, {{is named}} in his honor. Several naval <b>vessels</b> <b>are</b> named in Washington's honor, {{including}} the USS George Washington.|$|E
5|$|The {{blood vessels}} and lymph <b>vessels</b> <b>are</b> considered, the valves of the heart, and the {{separate}} functions of arteries and veins. Paley argues that such functions {{as that of the}} epiglottis could not have formed gradually (as by evolution).|$|E
5|$|In sailing, it {{has long}} been known that if the bearing from the target to the pursuer remains {{constant}}, known as constant bearing, decreasing range (CBDR), equivalent to taking a fixed reference point at infinite distance, the two <b>vessels</b> <b>are</b> on a collision course, both travelling in straight lines. In a simulation, this is readily observed as the lines between the two remain parallel at all times.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> fit {{for nothing}} but {{transport}} duties by 1815. In 1815, the <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> {{placed under the}} command of Acting Lieutenant Massy Herbert. Star was paid off into reserve in June 1816. The <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> sold in 1837.|$|R
50|$|The Norwegian Tjeld-class <b>vessels</b> <b>were</b> {{constructed}} at Westermoen Båtbyggeri in Mandal. The {{first group}} of twelve <b>vessels</b> <b>was</b> ordered in 1957, launched between 1959 and 1960, and commissioned in 1960-1962. A second group of eight <b>vessels</b> <b>was</b> ordered in 1962, launched 1962-63 and commissioned 1963-66.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> Japan, later renamed Kanrin-Maru (咸臨丸), and {{the second}} <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> Yedo, later renamed Chōyō Maru.|$|R
5|$|The {{national}} flag is sometimes flown by Singapore-registered vessels, {{although this is}} considered incorrect, as such <b>vessels</b> <b>are</b> required to hoist proper national colours either when entering or leaving port. The ensign is red and charged with a circle enclosing a crescent surmounted by five stars in a circle, all in white. The {{national flag}} is not used by coast guard ships and military warships; both classes of ships have their own specific ensigns.|$|E
5|$|The sails {{of these}} <b>vessels</b> <b>are</b> made of strips of bamboo, {{woven into the}} form of matting. The sailors never lower them (while sailing, but simply) change the {{direction}} of them according to whether {{the wind is blowing}} from one side or the other. When the ships cast anchor, the sails are left standing in the wind. Each of these ships is worked by 1,000 men, 600 sailors and 400 marines, among whom there are archers and crossbowmen furnished with shields, and men who throw (pots of) naptha. Each great vessel is followed by three others, a 'nisfi', a 'thoulthi' and a 'roubi' (f endnote: a pinnace, a small boat fitted with a rudder, and a rowing boat). These <b>vessels</b> <b>are</b> nowhere made except in the city of Zayton (Quanzhou) in China, or at Sin-Kilan, which is the same as Sin al-Sin (Guangzhou).|$|E
5|$|A large {{percentage}} of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event; rather than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that occurs at the moment of trauma when tissues and blood <b>vessels</b> <b>are</b> stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E
50|$|If a <b>vessel</b> <b>is</b> adrift and {{not being}} {{propelled}} by any instrument or device, {{it is said to}} be underway, not making way. The concept of whether a <b>vessel</b> <b>is,</b> or is not, underway has important legal ramifications. For example, in many jurisdictions a child must be wearing a personal flotation device at the time the <b>vessel</b> <b>is</b> underway.|$|R
50|$|The <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> {{launched}} in March 2012. The <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> christened by Lynn McBurney, {{the wife of}} McBurney Transport's Norman McBurney.|$|R
50|$|The <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> {{launched}} in March 1996 as the Stena Jutlandica. Prior to entering service the <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> renamed Stena Jutlandica III.|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} 1857, {{the need for}} a {{lighthouse}} on Point Stephens was identified, due to the proximity to the entrance of Port Stephens, and the dangers of the local coastline to ships. Another reason was that mariners were mistaking the entrance to Fingal Bay for that of Port Stephens. At least twenty four <b>vessels</b> <b>are</b> known to have been wrecked in the area. the most serious being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives. Another notable wreck was the Florence Irving in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Bronze <b>vessels</b> <b>are</b> {{made and}} placed one above {{the other at}} {{different}} levels; they are filled with pure water. Each has at the bottom a small opening {{in the form of}} a 'jade dragon's neck'. The water dripping (from above) enters two inflow receivers (alternately), the left one being for the night and the right one for the day. On the covers of each (inflow receiver) there are small cast statuettes in gilt bronze; the left (night) one is an immortal and the right (day) one is a policeman. These figures guide the indicator-rod (lit. arrow) with their left hands, and indicate the graduations on it with their right hands, thus giving the time.|$|E
5|$|Constanța Port {{is both a}} {{maritime}} and a river port. Daily, {{more than}} 200 river <b>vessels</b> <b>are</b> in the port for cargo loading or unloading or waiting to be operated. The connection of the port with the Danube river is made through the Danube–Black Sea Canal, which {{represents one of the}} main strengths of Constanța Port. Important cargo quantities are carried by river, between Constanta and Central and Eastern European countries: Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Austria, Slovakia and Germany. River traffic is very important for the Constanța Port, having a share of 23.3% of the total traffic in 2005, when 8,800 river vessels called to the port.|$|E

5|$|In the {{simplest}} type of circulatory system, two lateral <b>vessels</b> <b>are</b> {{joined at the}} ends to form a loop. However, many species have additional long-wise and cross-wise vessels. There is no heart nor pumping vessels, and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of both the vessels and the body wall's muscles. In some species, circulation is intermittent, and fluid ebbs and flows in the long-wise vessels. The fluid in the vessels is usually colorless, but in some species it contains cells that are yellow, orange, green or red. The red type contain hemoglobin and carry oxygen, but {{the function of the}} other pigments is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Nemerteans lack {{specialized}} gills, and respiration occurs {{over the}} surface of the body, which is long and sometimes flattened. Like other animals with thick body walls, they use fluid circulation rather than diffusion to move substances through their bodies. The circulatory system consists of the rhynchocoel and peripheral vessels, while blood of other invertebrates is contained in the main body cavity. The fluid in the rhynchocoel moves substances to and from the proboscis, and functions as a fluid skeleton in everting the proboscis and in burrowing. The vessels circulate fluid round the whole body and the rhynchocoel provides its own local circulation. The circulatory <b>vessels</b> <b>are</b> a system of coeloms.|$|E
5|$|Over 3 million <b>vessels</b> <b>are</b> {{employed}} in sea fishing. Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers {{with a small}} crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.|$|E
50|$|The {{first two}} <b>vessels</b> <b>were</b> {{launched}} in October 2009. All four <b>vessels</b> <b>were</b> delivered to Malta in late 2009, and officially commissioned on 18 March 2010.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2000 the <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> renamed Croazia Jet and {{operated}} for SNAV between Ancona and Split. Just {{over a year}} later the <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> laid up for around six months before making its third return to the Channel. It was renamed SeaCat France the <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> once again deployed on the Dover to Calais route.|$|R
25|$|The <b>vessel</b> <b>is</b> {{powered by}} two Wärtsilä 8L46 diesel engines which drive two {{controllable}} pitch propellers. The <b>vessel</b> <b>is</b> also equipped with two Wärtsilä CT200 bow thrusters.|$|R
5|$|Vascular {{cells are}} known to play a {{prominent}} role in regulating proliferation of adult neural precursors. In the adult subgranular zone (SGZ), dense clusters of dividing cells were found to be anatomically close to the vasculature, especially capillaries. Contacts between adult SVZ neuronal precursors and blood <b>vessels</b> <b>are</b> unusually permeable and frequently devoid of astrocyte and pericyte interferences, suggesting that blood-derived cues are gaining direct access to adult neural precursors and their progeny. The vasculature also provides the substrate for new neuron migration after injury in the adult striatum.|$|E
5|$|Verses 4.26–35 {{state that}} the human body has {{fourteen}} nadis (blood vessels), of which three are primary. Sushumna (Sanskrit: सुषुम्णा) is the most important, as it extends all along the spinal cord and reaches into the head, sustaining the whole body. Vishnu is the deity whose power propels Sushumna according to verse 4.31. On {{both sides of the}} Sushumna reside the Ida and Pingala vessels, the former connected to the moon and the latter to the sun. These three drive the three Guṇas (forces behind the innate character) of a being, with Sushumna driving Sattva (goodness), Pingala driving the Rajas (action), and Ida driving the Tamas (destructiveness). These primary <b>vessels</b> <b>are</b> connected to numerous channels inside the human body, which pervade the whole body, and nourish it.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} continues, {{several of the}} <b>vessels</b> <b>are</b> {{destroyed}} by explosions. The Doctor suspects that the crew aboard the Buccaneer, a 17th-century pirate ship, responsible {{as it was the}} closest vessel at the time of destruction. Turlough, while attempting to escape control of the Black Guardian, ends up aboard the Buccaneer, and meets the Eternal Captain Wrack, learning she too is working for the Black Guardian. He finds equipment aboard her ship that appears to be the source of the device destroying the other ships and hears the Black Guardian's voice nearby. Later, Wrack offers the Edwardian officers a reception aboard her ship. During the reception, Turlough demonstrates the equipment to the Doctor, while Wrack gifts Tegan with a tiara with a red crystal. After the reception and continuation of the race, the Doctor sees the Buccaneer nearing the Edwardian ship, and determines that the red crystal is used as a focal point of the weapon, and gets rid of the tiara before Wrack can destroy the ship.|$|E
