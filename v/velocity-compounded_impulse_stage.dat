5000|$|Except for {{low-power}} applications, {{turbine blades}} {{are arranged in}} multiple stages in series, called compounding, which greatly improves efficiency at low speeds. A reaction stage is a row of fixed nozzles followed by a row of moving nozzles. Multiple reaction stages divide the pressure drop between the steam inlet and exhaust into numerous small drops, resulting in a pressure-compounded turbine. Impulse stages may be either pressure-compounded, velocity-compounded, or pressure-velocity compounded. A pressure-compounded impulse stage is a row of fixed nozzles followed by a row of moving blades, with multiple stages for compounding. This {{is also known as}} a Rateau turbine, after its inventor. A <b>velocity-compounded</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>stage</b> (invented by Curtis and also called a [...] "Curtis wheel") is a row of fixed nozzles followed by two or more rows of moving blades alternating with rows of fixed blades. This divides the velocity drop across the stage into several smaller drops. A series of velocity-compounded impulse stages is called a pressure-velocity compounded turbine.|$|E

50|$|Steam {{turbines}} {{operate on}} a Rankine cycle. Steam can be generated by a receiver directly from the solar heat flux, which {{eliminates the need for}} a heat exchanger. However, some plants deploy molten salts to attain higher temperatures, which eliminates the need for steam boilers. Values of pressure and temperature in solar plants are 50-100 bar and 400-500 °C, respectively. Both <b>impulse</b> and reaction <b>stages</b> can be used. For small values of power, <b>impulse</b> <b>stages</b> are preferable.|$|R
50|$|To {{avoid these}} problems, another method of {{utilizing}} a high pressure ratio is employed {{in which the}} total pressure drop is divided {{into a number of}} <b>impulse</b> <b>stages.</b> These are known as pressure-compounded or Rateau stages. On account of the comparatively lower pressure drop, the nozzle blade rows are subsonic (M < 1). Therefore, such a stage does not suffer from the disabilities of the velocity stages.|$|R
50|$|This {{is special}} case used for impulse turbine which suggest that entire {{pressure}} drop in the turbine is obtained in the stator. The stator performs a nozzle action converting pressure head to velocity head and extracting work. It is difficult to achieve adiabatic expansion in the <b>impulse</b> <b>stage,</b> i.e. expansion only in the nozzle, due to irreversibility involved, in actual practice. Figure 8 shows the corresponding enthalpy drop for the reaction = 0 case.|$|R
50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} is lost efficiency due to discarded propellant. Gas-generator cycles tend to {{have lower}} specific <b>impulse</b> than <b>staged</b> combustion cycles.|$|R
50|$|Figure shows two {{reaction}} {{stages and}} the variation of pressure and {{velocity of the}} gas in them. The gas pressure decreases continuously over both fixed and moving rows of blades. Since the pressure drop in each stage is smaller {{as compared to the}} <b>impulse</b> <b>stages,</b> the gas velocities are relatively low. Besides this the flow is accelerating throughout. These factors make the reaction stages aerodynamically more efficient though the tip leakage loss is increased on account of the relatively higher pressure difference across the rotor blades.|$|R

40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} problem {{under consideration}} {{is shown in}} Figure 1. The wavemaker on the left will start moving suddenly with speed U. This is a classic problem and analytical solution based on the potential flow can be obtained easily at the early stage of the motion. Peregrine (1972), for example, solved the problem based on an expansion {{in terms of time}} t. His solution reveals that the vertical velocity at the intersection is infinite, which is due to the incompatibility of boundary conditions on the free surface and the body surface at that point. It was later found (Lin, Newman & Yue 1985) that the proper treatment of this singularity is crucial for obtaining accurate numerical solution. Here we will show that this incompatibility also has profound effect on the pressure distribution. Some of features seem not to have been observed before. As argued by Wu (1998), for this kind of problem due to sudden motion, the initial impact can be divided into two stages: (1) the <b>impulse</b> <b>stage</b> between + − < ≤ 00 t and (2) the post <b>impulse</b> <b>stage</b> + = 0 t. From Peregrine’s solution (1972), we can write the velocity potential at + = 0 t, or the solution at the second stage, a...|$|R

40|$|The Rocketdyne Orbital Transfer Vehicle (OTV) cryogenic, {{rocket engine}} system, high pressure, liquid {{hydrogen}} turbopump was designed with a two-stage, partial-admission axial turbine.

This paper explores the benefits of a smaller system that adds the advantages of a high specific <b>impulse</b> air-breathing <b>stage</b> and supersonic launch speeds. The method of virtual specific impulse is introduced as a tool to emphasize the gains afforded by launch assist.
