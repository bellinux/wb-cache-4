50|$|There {{have been}} too few cases of TS {{reported}} for a standard treatment to be established. In some cases, improvement in immune function has been noted to produce spontaneous improvement in TS symptoms. This pattern {{is consistent with the}} behavior of other viral diseases found in immunocompromised patients, most relevantly with the nephropathy associated in kidney transplant recipients with the polyomavirus BK virus. Antiviral drugs such as <b>valganciclovir</b> and cidofovir have shown benefit in treating this disorder in case reports.|$|E
50|$|<b>Valganciclovir</b> is a prodrug for ganciclovir, {{which is}} a {{synthetic}} analog of 2′-deoxy-guanosine. Its structure {{is the same as}} ganciclovir, except for the addition of a L-valyl ester at the 5' end of the incomplete deoxyribose ring. The valine increases both the absorption of the drug in the intestines, as well as the bioavailability of the drug once it is absorbed. The L-valyl ester is cleaved by esterases in the intestines and the liver, leaving ganciclovir to be absorbed by the virus-infected cells.|$|E
50|$|While not {{studied in}} people, {{it can be}} assumed that {{interactions}} will be similar as those with ganciclovir, since <b>valganciclovir</b> is converted into ganciclovir in the body. Zidovudine may decrease the concentration of ganciclovir, and together the drugs can cause anemia and neutropenia. Probenecid can increase the concentration of ganciclovir, which could increase the chances of ganciclovir toxicity. People with kidney problems could have an increase in both mycophenolate mofetil and ganciclovir concentrations when both drugs are taken together. Ganciclovir can also increase the concentration of didanosine.|$|E
50|$|Ganciclovir (Cytovene) {{treatment}} {{is used for}} patients with depressed immunity who have either sight-related or life-threatening illnesses. <b>Valganciclovir</b> (Valcyte) is an antiviral drug that is also effective and is given orally.

A variety of amino acid changes in the UL97 protein kinase and the viral DNA polymerase have been reported to cause drug resistance. Foscarnet or cidofovir are only given to patients with CMV resistant to ganciclovir, because foscarnet has notable nephrotoxicity, resulting in increased or decreased Ca2+ or P, and decreased Mg2+.|$|E
50|$|Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a proliferative skin {{disorder}} {{that occurs in}} immunocompromised people and is considered benign, but can be disfiguring. It was suspected {{to be associated with}} viral infection {{on the basis of the}} patient population in which it appeared, and electron microscopy studies of clinical samples identified virus-like particles of a size and shape consistent with a polyomavirus. Unlike Merkel cell carcinoma caused mostly by Merkel cell polyomavirus, trichodysplasia spinulosa is a dysplasia rather than a neoplasia. TSPyV appears to actively replicate in the hair follicle inner root sheath cells; hyperproliferation of these cells is thought to underlie the clinically observable manifestations of the disease. Antiviral drugs such as <b>valganciclovir</b> and cidofovir have shown benefit in treating this disorder in case reports.|$|E

Methods: Consecutive patients with anterior segment inflammation due to CMV causing anterior uveitis or corneal endotheliitis treated with oral <b>valganciclovir</b> were reviewed. Diagnosis of CMV infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction of the aqueous aspirate prior to commencement of oral <b>valganciclovir.</b> All patients were treated with an oral loading dose of 900 mg <b>valganciclovir</b> twice daily for at least 2 weeks, followed by an additional 450 mg <b>valganciclovir</b> twice-daily maintenance therapy. Changes in visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), use of antiglaucomatous eye drops, and recurrence were analyzed. Results: Thirteen eyes of 11 patients were followed for a mean of 17. 2 months. Two patients had bilateral corneal endotheliitis. All eyes had absence of anterior segment inflammation within 3 weeks after treatment. Following treatment, the mean logMAR visual acuity improved significantly from 0. 58 at baseline to 0. 37 at the last follow-up (P = 0. 048). The mean IOP and number of antiglaucomatous eye drops also decreased significantly (P = 0. 021 and P = 0. 004, respectively). Five (38. 5 %) eyes had recurrence of anterior uveitis after <b>valganciclovir</b> was stopped and required retreatment with oral <b>valganciclovir.</b> Conclusion: Oral <b>valganciclovir</b> appeared to be effective in controlling CMV anterior uveitis, resulting in visual improvement and IOP reduction following control of inflammation.

40|$|Several anti-viral {{drugs have}} {{demonstrated}} efficacy in preventing Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients. The recently approved <b>valganciclovir</b> {{is the most}} commonly used and most expensive drug for CMV prevention. The safety and efficacy data have been drawn from a single trial. We hypothesized that <b>valganciclovir</b> may not be as safe as nor more effective than other therapies for CMV prevention. All experimental and analytical studies that compared <b>valganciclovir</b> with other therapies for prevention of CMV infection after SOT were selected. Based on meta-analytic and multivariate regression methodologies we critically analyzed all available evidence. Nine studies were included (N = 1, 831).

For a neutropenia cut-off of < 1, 000 /mm(3), the risk remained elevated (OR 1. 97, 95 %CI 1. 03 to 3. 67; P = 0. 04; I(2) = 0 %). For every 24 patients who receive <b>valganciclovir</b> prophylaxis, one more will develop neutropenia compared to other therapies. The risk of late-onset CMV disease with <b>valganciclovir</b> was similar to ganciclovir and higher than those with non-ganciclovir therapies (OR 8. 95, 95 %CI 1. 07 to 74. 83; P = 0. 04; I(2) = 0 %]. One more patient will develop late-onset CMV disease for every 25 who receive <b>valganciclovir</b> compared to treatment with non-ganciclovir therapies. The risk of CMV tissue-invasive disease in liver recipients receiving <b>valganciclovir</b> was 4. 5 times the risk seen with ganciclovir [95 %CI 1. 00 to 20. 14] (p = 0. 04).
