40|$|The receiver's {{emittance}} and {{vacuum pressure}} {{are the two}} of great significance issues on the heat-loss which is the main factor reducing {{the efficiency of the}} parabolic though systems. In this paper, the thermal steady-state equilibrium method was used to test the receivers’ heat-loss. The receivers with increasing emittance were tested to study the variation of heat-loss. Meanwhile, the variable vacuum pressure in the annulus that affects the efficiency of the system was investigated. The influence of <b>vacuumizing</b> rate and getters on the vacuum pressure and heat-loss were discussed. The result shows that the emittance and vacuum pressure affect the receiver's heat-loss dramatically, and the emittance is the major influence factor on the thermal properties. The receiver with 0. 08 emittance and 10 − 3  Pa vacuum pressure has a satisfactory heat-loss of 215. 6  W/m at 400  °C. The analysis further reveals that the synergistic effect of both emittance and vacuum pressure on the heat-loss can be reflected by the packaging temperature of the glass tube, and a fitting formula has been established to estimate the receivers’ heat-loss according to the packaging temperature of the glass tube...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this project {{is to develop a}} high {{performance}} air water heat pump which is able to be introducted in the retrofit market. The system requirements of this market are heating temperatures of 65 °C, at ambient temperatures descending until - 12 °C. To provide higher base performance ratings, the choice of the thermodynamic system is a two stage heat pump with economizer exchanger. This type of heat pump has improved performances over a large range of application. For heat output adjustment it can be switched to different heating modes (single stage and two stage). For the two stage cycle, the lubrification of the compressors is a major aspect to be studied. A new online measurement method is applied to evaluate the oil quantity which migrates through the cycle. The absorption spectre of the refrigerant - oil mixture is analysed with a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and oil quantity can be extracted with high precision. (The analysis method has still to be refined). The infrared spectometers also allow to control the composition of the refrigerant mixture. A single capture of the spectre needs about 30 seconds. The measurements have to be referred to a regularly updated background spectre, which requests to <b>vacuumize</b> and clean the measurement cell. The oil migration is simultaneously measured with a high precision densitymeter. The output signal allows a real time follow of the oil quantity and the transmitter will give reliable results after calibration over the application range. Any change of the refrigerant composition cannot be captured by the densitymeter. The resulting density shift would therefore not be attributed correctly to the amount of oil. For the analysis of oil distribution in the whole heat pump, the measurement method to determine the oil level in the compressor crankcase, and the observation of the oil retention in the evaporator are also discussed in this project. The heat pump design has been made, based on simulations of the thermodynamic cycle and using existing parts in the laboratory, such as the evaporator and the condenser. The design aim is to avoid oil trapping and to ensure oil transport in the vapour lines of the heat pump. free download : www. waermepumpe. ch/fe/berichte. htm...|$|R

40|$|Alloys {{based on}} the titanium-niobium system are widely used in implant production. It is conditional, first of all, on the low modulus of {{elasticity}} and bio-inert properties of an alloy. These alloys are especially important for tooth replacement and orthopedic surgery. At present alloys {{based on the}} titanium-niobium system are produced mainly using conventional metallurgical methods. The further subtractive manufacturing an end product results {{in a lot of}} wastes, increasing, therefore, its cost. The alternative of these processes is additive manufacturing. Selective laser melting is a technology, which makes it possible to synthesize products of metal powders and their blends. The point of this technology is laser melting a layer of a powdered material; then a sintered layer is coated with the next layer of powder etc. Complex products and working prototypes are made on the base of this technology. The authors of this paper address to the issue of applying selective laser melting in order to synthesize a binary alloy of a composite powder based on the titanium-niobium system.

30|$|A {{calibrated}} dilatometer with {{a volume}} of 3.594  mL made of heat-resistant glass was put into a water jacket equipped with a UT- 15 thermostat. The temperature of heat carrier (distilled water) was controlled with a TL- 6 thermometer (measuring accuracy ± 0.1  °C). The volume change was measured with a KM- 6 cathetometer (measuring accuracy ± 0.001  mm). The passed time of the reaction was measured with a stopwatch. The accuracy of time measurement does not exceed 1  s during 30  min. To prepare the solution of monomer, 0.05  mol of monomeric complex, 5  mL of dimethylformamide, and 2, 2 ′-azo-bis(isobutyronitrile) in amount of 1 % w/w were put into a beaker and stirred until complete dissolution. The homogeneous solution thus obtained was transferred into the dilatometer with a long funnel. The dilatometer was attached to a vacuum pump and an argon tank by a three-way stopcock. The cooled dilatometer was firstly <b>vacuumized</b> and then filled with argon. This procedure was carried out three times. Prepared dilatometer filled with argon was sealed, and the reference point was set with the cathetometer at 20.0  °C. Afterwards, the dilatometer was put into the water jacket (the temperature of heat carrier was maintained at 80.0  °C) and the contraction of the solution was monitored with cathetometer. The time reading was started {{in a few minutes}} after the initial thermal expansion of liquid had finished. The stopwatch’s readings were taken in 1 – 5 -min increments depending on the rate of contraction. After the polymerization had been completed, the dilatometer was taken out from the water jacket and put into ice-cold water. Its content was quantitatively transferred into a beaker with isopropyl alcohol to precipitate the polymeric complex.

30|$|Valve V 2 was {{switched}} to position 2 before the CO trap was heated to ambient temperature. This {{was followed by}} the transfer of [11 C]CO to the micro-autoclave in a stream of helium (3 bar) by switching valve V 2 to position 1. After this transfer, valve V 2 was switched back to position 2. The freshly prepared precursor solution was loaded on the reagent loop and transferred to the micro-autoclave using THF pumped at a pressure of up to 300 bar. This high pressure forced both [11 C]CO and the helium transfer gas to dissolve in the reagent solution in the micro-autoclave, which then was heated for 5 min at 120 °C to facilitate the carbonylation reaction. Next, the reaction mixture was transferred to a <b>vacuumized</b> vial by switching valve V 2 to position 3. The product solution was degassed with helium (10 mL) to remove residual [11 C]CO and other gaseous compounds. Next, the reaction mixture was diluted with H 2 O (1 mL), injected on the preparative HPLC system and purified using HPLC method A. [11 C]phenytoin, with a retention time in the range of 7 to 9 min, was collected directly into a vortex evaporator (PET Evap, Scansys Laboratortechnik, Copenhagen, Denmark). During fraction collection, the HPLC eluent was evaporated continuously at 60 °C under N 2 gas at high flow. After the HPLC eluent was removed, buffered 0.9 % NaCl aqueous solution (12 mL, pH 7, 4; 8.4 -mM Na 2 HPO 4 / 1.8 -mM NaH 2 PO 4) was added, and the reformulated [11 C]phenytoin was passed over a Millex GV filter (0.22 μM, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and dispensed into a sterile product vial. The chemical and radiochemical purity was assessed using analytical HPLC method B. All radiochemical yields reported are based on the amount of initial radioactivity {{at the start of the}} carbonylation reaction, as determined by measuring the reaction mixture after transfer from the micro-autoclave.

40|$|To {{create new}} types of cars, raise their reliability, gain {{operational}} life, and decrease in metal consumption of products {{it is necessary to}} improve mechanical, physical, and also special properties of the constructional materials applied in mechanical engineering. Presently, there are intensive researches and developments under way to create materials with ultrafine-grained structure (the sizes of grains in their crystal lattice make less than 1 micron in one of the measurements). BMSTU developed a manufacturing technology of multilayer steel sheets with steady ultrafine-grained structure based on the multiple hot rolling of billet as a composition consisting of the alternating metal sheets. A principled condition for implementation of such technology is existence of different crystallographic modifications in the adjoining sheets of the composition at specified temperature of rolling. Power parameters of rolling are important technical characteristics of the process. Usually, to determine a deformation resistance value when rolling the diverse multilayer materials, is used the actual resistance value averaging in relation to the components of the composition. The aim of this work is a comparative analysis of known calculated dependences with experimental data when rolling the 100 -layer samples. Objects of research were the 100 -layer compositions based on the alternating layers of steel 08 H 18 N 10 and U 8. Experimental samples represented the <b>vacuumized</b> capsules with height, width, and length of 53 mm x 53 mm x 200 mm, respectively, in which there were the 100 -layer packs from sheets, each of 0. 5 mm, based on the composition of steels (U 8 + 08 H 18 N 10). Rolling was made on the double-high mill with rolls of 160 mm in diameter during 19 passes to the thickness of 7 mm with the speed of 0, 1 m/s. Relative sinking in each pass was accepted to be equal 10 ± 2, 5 %. Rolling forces were measured by the strain-gauging method using the measuring cells, located under press screws of the mill. The oven thermocouple controlled a rolling temperature, and two pyrometers Optris CTlaser 3 MH 3 at the input and output parts of the mill made records. Comparison of the rolling forces of the multilayer composition U 8 + 08 H 18 N 10, which were received during experiment, with the calculated values, shows that with accumulative nature of deformations the real forces of rolling 1. 5 – 2 times exceed the calculated values. The analysis of experimental data showed illegality of using the averagely proportional value of the flow limit to calculate the rolling forces of compositions with the large number of the alternating thin layers of various steels. For calculations of the rolling forces of such super-multilayer materials, a deformation resistance of each composition ought to be determined using the experimental data. </p...|$|E
