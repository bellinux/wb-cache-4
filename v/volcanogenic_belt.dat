40|$|An isotope-geochemical {{study of}} Eocene-Oligocene magmatic rocks from the Western Kamchatka-Koryak <b>volcanogenic</b> <b>belt</b> {{revealed}} lateral heterogeneity of mantle magma sources in its segments: Western Kamchatka, Central Koryak, and Northern Koryak ones. In the Western Kamchatka segment magmatic melts were generated from isotopically heterogeneous (depleted and/or insignificantly enriched) mantle sources significantly contaminated by quartz-feldspathic sialic sediments; higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0. 70429 - 0. 70564) and lower 143 Nd/ 144 Nd [eNd(T) = 0. 06 - 2. 9] ratios in volcanic rocks from the Central Koryak segment presumably reflect contribution of an enriched mantle source; high positive eNd(T) and low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in magmatic rocks from the Northern Koryak segment area indicate their derivation from an isotopically depleted mantle source without significant contamination by sialic or mantle material enriched in radiogenic Sr and Nd. Significantly different contamination histories of Eocene-Oligocene mantle magmas in Kamchatka and Koryakia {{are related to}} their different thermal regimes: higher heat flow beneath Kamchatka led to crustal melting and contamination of mantle suprasubduction magmas by crustal melts. Cessation of suprasubduction volcanism in the Western Kamchatka segment of the continental margin belt was possibly related to accretion of the Achaivayam-Valagin terrane 40 Ma ago, whereas suprasubduction activity in the Koryak segment stopped due to closure of the Ukelayat basin in Oligocene...|$|E
