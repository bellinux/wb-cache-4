5000|$|<b>Vibroscope</b> (vibrare 'vibrate' + [...] ) is an {{instrument}} for observing and tracing (and sometimes recording) vibration.|$|E
50|$|For example, a {{primitive}} mechanical <b>vibroscope</b> {{consists of a}} vibrating object with a pointy end which leaves a wave trace on a smoked surface of a rotating cylinder.|$|E
50|$|For single fibers, {{instead of}} weighing, a machine called a <b>vibroscope</b> is used. A known {{length of the}} fiber (usually 20 mm) is set to vibrate, and its {{fundamental}} frequency measured, allowing the calculation of the mass and thus the (linear density).|$|E
50|$|<b>Vibroscopes</b> {{are also}} used to study sound in {{different}} areas of the mouth during speech.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vibroscopes</b> {{are used}} to study {{properties}} of substances. For examples, polymers' torsional modulus and Young's modulus may be determined by vibrating the polymers and measuring their frequency of vibration under certain external forces. Similar approach works to determine linear density of thread-shaped objects, such as fibers, filaments, and yarn.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) is a {{new kind}} of fiber-optic sensor that {{possesses}} all the advantages of well-established Bragg grating technology in addition to being able to excite cladding modes resonantly. This device opens up a multitude of opportunities for single-point sensing in hard-to-reach spaces with very controllable cross-sensitivities, absolute and relative measurements of various parameters, and an extreme sensitivity to materials external to the fiber without requiring the fiber to be etched or tapered. Over the past five years, our research group has been developing multimodal fiber-optic sensors based on TFBG in various shapes and forms, always keeping the device itself simple to fabricate and compatible with low-cost manufacturing. This paper presents a brief review of the principle, fabrication, characterization, and implementation of TFBGs, followed by our progress in TFBG sensors for mechanical and biochemical applications, including one-dimensional TFBG <b>vibroscopes,</b> accelerometers and micro-displacement sensors; two-dimensional TFBG vector <b>vibroscopes</b> and vector rotation sensors; reflective TFBG refractometers with in-fiber and fiber-to-fiber configurations; polarimetric and plasmonic TFBG biochemical sensors for in-situ detection of cell, protein and glucose...|$|R
50|$|Linear {{density of}} fibers and yarns can be {{measured}} by many methods. The simplest one is to measure a length of material and weigh it. However, this requires a large sample and masks the variability of linear density along the thread, and is difficult to apply if the fibers are crimped or otherwise cannot lay flat relaxed. If {{the density of the}} material is known, the fibers are measured individually and have a simple shape, a more accurate method is direct imaging of the fiber with SEM to measure the diameter and calculation of the linear density. Finally, linear density is directly measured with a <b>vibroscope.</b> The sample is tensioned between two hard points, mechanical vibration is induced and the fundamental frequency is measured.|$|E
40|$|A fiber-optic vector <b>vibroscope</b> {{based on}} {{orthogonal}} polarization cladding-to-core recoupling is demonstrated. A compact structure {{in which a}} short section of polarization-maintained (PM) fiber stub containing a straight fiber Bragg grating (FBG) is spliced to another single-mode fiber. Two well-defined orthogonally polarized cladding modes reflected by the PM-FBG are recoupled at the junction and the coupling intensity shows an extremely high sensitivity to bending in the corresponding orthogonal directions. Both the orientation and amplitude of the vibrations can be determined unambiguously via dual-path power detection of these recoupled orthogonal-polarimetric cladding modes (LP ₁,₁₂ and LP ₁,₁₃). Since spectral information is not required, temperature changes do not affect the sensor response, and power fluctuations can be referenced out by monitoring the power in the core mode (LP ₀,₁) resonance.

40|$|Single {{filament}} testing protocols for polyacrylonitrile precursor and polyacrylonitrile-based {{carbon fibers}} {{have been developed}} to ensure reliable tensile results that can be compared to the standard testing protocols used by the industry. Accurate carbon fiber linear density measurement by <b>vibroscope</b> was quite sensitive to the pre-stress applied to the fiber. Gauge length dependence testing of the commercial carbon fibers exhibited that tensile strengths obtained at 25. 4 mm gauge length are comparable to those reported by the manufacturer using the standard strand testing results. On the other hand, experimental carbon fibers that have not been surface treated or sized, showed that single filament tensile strength values at 6 mm gauge length was comparable to the strand testing results. In addition, the compliance corrected tensile moduli of carbon fibers obtained by single filament tests were also comparable to the moduli obtained from the standard strand testing results. A modified Weibull analysis, which accounts for sample volume effects, has also been used to determine the Weibull modulus of both the commercial and experimental carbon fibers. close...|$|E
2500|$|Most {{vibration}} {{testing is}} {{conducted in a}} 'single DUT axis' at a time, even though most real-world vibration occurs in various axes simultaneously. [...] MIL-STD-810G, released in late 2008, Test Method 527, calls for multiple exciter testing. The vibration test fixture used to attach the DUT to the shaker table must be designed for the frequency range of the vibration test spectrum. Generally for smaller fixtures and lower frequency ranges, the designer targets a fixture design that is free of resonances in the test frequency range. This becomes more difficult as the DUT gets larger and as the test frequency increases. In these cases multi-point control strategies can mitigate some of the resonances that may {{be present in the}} future. Devices specifically designed to trace or record vibrations are called <b>vibroscopes.</b>|$|R
