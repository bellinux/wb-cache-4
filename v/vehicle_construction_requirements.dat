The study provides recommendations to address identified weaknesses associated with a CCO''s ability to execute <b>construction</b> <b>requirements</b> for USSOCOM. One such recommendation {{is the development of}} a Construction Management Module (CM 2) to better manage the contingency contracting process for <b>construction</b> <b>requirements.</b> This module will employ a synergistic approach (integrating joint capabilities) to planning and executing <b>construction</b> <b>requirements</b> in the USSOCOM contingency AOR.

Ignorance of <b>vehicle</b> <b>construction</b> and wrongly chosen technology leads to subsequent after crash damages. Professional approach leads {{not only to}} after crash damages minimization on the vehicle, road and the surroundings, but also to convoy minimization etc. Another covered topic is tank <b>vehicle</b> <b>construction</b> (semi-trailer, trailer) because knowledge of tank construction and knowledge of transported material enable quick and safe extrication. Correct extrication method (which is also described in the thesis) can be used thanks to knowledge of crashed tank construction. Not knowing all needed information leads to after crash damages. This thesis will focus mainly on how to prevent subsequent damages...|$|R
