40|$|Al-Si alloys {{are very}} {{universal}} materials, comprising of from 85 % to 90 % of the aluminium cast parts produced for {{the automotive industry}} (e. g. various motor mounts, engine parts, cylinder heads, pistons, <b>valve</b> <b>retainer,</b> compressor parts, etc.). Production of primary Al- alloys belong to heavy source fouling of life environs. Care of environment of aluminium {{is connected to the}} decreasing consumption of resource as energy, materials, water, and soil, and with an increase in recycling and extension life of products in industry. Recycled (secondary) aluminium alloys are made out of Al-scrap and workable Al-garbage by recycling. The automotive casts from aluminium alloys are heat treated for achieving better properties. Al-Si alloys contain more addition elements, that form various intermetallic phases in the structure. They usually contain a certain amount of Fe, Mn, Mg, and Zn that are present either unintentionally, or they are added deliberately to provide special material properties. These elements partly go into the solid solution in the matrix and partly form intermetallic particles during solidification which affect the mechanical properties. Controlling the microstructure of secondary aluminium cast alloy is therefore very important. Key words: secondary Al alloy, intermetallic phases, structural analysis, solution treatment, mechanical properties...|$|E
50|$|Valve float {{can also}} be {{prevented}} by using lighter valvetrain components. Titanium <b>valves,</b> <b>retainers,</b> and pushrods are commonly used for this purpose. Undercut valves can both increase flow and decrease weight. Also, by using more than the traditional two valves per cylinder, smaller and lighter valves can be used. By reducing valvetrain mass, valves can close more rapidly with a given spring stiffness.|$|R
50|$|The {{camshaft}} is billet steel, {{made from}} 8620 carbon or S7 through-hardened tool steel or similar. It runs in five oil pressure lubricated bearing shells and {{is driven by}} gears {{in the front of}} the engine. Mechanical roller lifters (cam followers) ride atop the cam lobes and drive the steel push rods up into the steel rocker arms that actuate the valves. The rockers are of roller tip type on the intake and exhaust sides. Like the cam follower rollers, the steel tip roller rotates on a steel roller bearing and the steel rocker arms rotate on a pair of through-hardened tool steel shafts within bronze bushings. Intake and exhaust rockers are billet. The dual valve springs are of coaxial type and made out of titanium. <b>Valve</b> <b>retainers</b> are also made of titanium, as are the rocker covers.|$|R
5000|$|Another engine, {{supposedly}} {{based upon}} the Cosworth BDA and YB series engines, weighed 168 lb, half the weight of its metal counterpart. [...] Plastic parts included the engine block, cam cover, air intake trumpets, intake valve stems, piston skirts and wrist pins, connecting rods, oil scraper piston rings, tappets, <b>valve</b> spring <b>retainers</b> and timing gears.|$|R
5000|$|Power: [...] @ 6000 rpm*Torque: 510 Nm @ 4800 rpm A {{modified}} version of the LS1 enhanced by Callaway Cars Incorporated, this engine was used on the VTII, VX and Y series of GTS models as well as the SV300. Differences from the LS1 included ported cylinder heads, larger throttle body, revised camshaft, remapped ECU, titanium <b>valve</b> spring <b>retainers,</b> upgraded <b>valve</b> springs and valves. The compression ratio was also lowered slightly to 9.95:1 and the engine ran MAFless. In HSV models, this engine was used with a higher than standard 3.91:1 final drive ratio.|$|R
50|$|This {{engine was}} a {{reworked}} {{version of the}} F20C, a new rod stroke ratio the redline was dropped to 8000RPM to produce better low end torque. The camshafts were also revised along with <b>valve</b> spring and <b>retainers.</b> All these changes increased the peak torque by 6% however the power output stayed the same.|$|R
5000|$|The final {{model of}} the above initial series was the MAE in 1965, when new rules were {{introduced}} in Formula 3 allowing up to [...] engines with 36mm intake restrictor plate. MAE used one barrel of a two barrel Weber IDA downdraft carburetor with the other barrel blanked off. The domination of this engine was absolute as long as these regulations lasted until 1968. As Cosworth had a serious difficulty meeting the demand, the MAE was mainly sold as a kit. This experience led to the later FVA/DFV contract to be drawn where the responsibility of development rested with Cosworth, and the manufacturing right and responsibility rested with Ford. There also were some specially cast iron heads with similar dimensions to these brazed heads with Titanium alloy <b>valve</b> spring <b>retainers</b> called the 'Screamer Head' for MAE in later years.|$|R
50|$|Engines must utilize Volkswagen {{series type}} 1, 1600cc, U.S. model sedan {{components}} and dimensions. Compression ratio and camshaft duration are unlimited. Stock dual-port cylinder heads cannot be ported or otherwise modified other than by flycutting for compression and 3-angle valve job. 1-piece stainless steel valves are allowed. Valve train {{is open for}} <b>valve</b> springs, <b>retainers,</b> locks, pushrods, and lifters; however, stock rocker arms must be utilized and their lift ratio must remain stock 1.1:1. Reciprocating assembly must be stock Volkswagen components but may be balanced. In {{the case of the}} connecting rods: one rod must remain untouched and the other 3 rods may be balanced to match. Pistons may be interchanged to forged, and engine cases may be machined for compression. Full flow oiling, oil galley plugs, case gussets, shuffle pinning, oil squirters, bronze lifter bores are all common case modifications. A top quality type 1, 1600cc engine will produce approximately 85 hp and withstand 5000-6000 rpm operation {{during the course of a}} full-length event, sometimes lasting over 25 hours.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the cars}} are fitted with K-1 and K-2 triple <b>valves</b> with <b>{{retainers}},</b> the retainers are always set for the full release position. Brake pipe pressure is set to 70 lbs. fully charged and controlling speed with needed reductions as the grade and load require. The light weight of the cars is accentuated when the train is full vs. empty, making {{a big difference in}} how the engineer will handle the train on the return. While riding the train, you will likely hear the hiss of air being released from the brake cylinders as the train goes into the long horseshoe curve, where the grade is flat enough to maintain speed and recharge the brake pipe at the same time. As the engine nears the end of the curve, another set is generally made progressively and will be maintained until the Thunderhead Gap bridge, where the process is repeated and the final application is made for the descent into the lower loop. Once on the lower loop, the train drifts past the engine house and pulls the light grade back into the station.|$|R
5000|$|Cage {{and shell}} {{reinforcement}} were done by Matter France. F7R engine was tuned by Sodemo and produced around 250 hp in early evolutions (around 275 hp for last evolutions with destroked engine). Main {{difference to the}} Gr.A car {{was the use of}} individual throttle bodies and even wilder cams. Other differences include modified head for improved gas flow and modified block for better cooling. Extremely wild cams with maximum lift up to 15 mm required the use of solid lifters and titanium <b>valves,</b> springs and <b>retainers.</b> Pistons and rods were made by Pankl. Pistons were a forged [...] "slipper" [...] design and rods were forged H section with custom 150 mm length to compensate for different piston compression height. Compression ratio was 12.5:1 and ran on special racing fuel. Exhaust manifold was a 4-2-1 design and was made from Inconel alloy. Clutch was made by AP Racing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{desmodromic}} system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to overcome the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass and all of the <b>valve</b> spring <b>retainer</b> mass. However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms per valve, so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use roller tappets in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate hydraulic valve lash adjusters in a desmodromic system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as valve lash is typically set using a shim under a cam follower.|$|R
