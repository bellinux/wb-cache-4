To evaluate PON 1 activity in relation to cadmium, lead, and mercury levels in healthy, premenopausal women. Women from upstate New York were followed for ≥ two menstrual cycles. Repeated measures linear mixed models estimated the association between cadmium, lead, and mercury levels (by tertile: T 1, T 2, T 3) and PON 1 arylesterase (PON 1 A) and PON 1 paraoxonase (PON 1 P) activity, separately. Analyses were stratified by PON 1 Q 192 R phenotype and un-stratified. Median blood cadmium, lead, and mercury concentrations were 0. 30 µg/L, 0. 87 µg/dL, and 1. 15 µg/L. In un-stratified analyses cadmium and mercury were associated with decreased PON 1 A activity (<b>T</b> 2 <b>vs.</b> <b>T</b> 1; not <b>T</b> 3 <b>vs.</b> <b>T</b> 1) but metals were not associated with PON 1 P.

Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) measurements were performed in ten healthy adults in the right lateral position. Five different EELs with four different <b>V</b> (<b>T)</b> s at each EEL were tested in random order, resulting in 19 combinations.

With increasing EEL but normal tidal volume, ventilation was preferentially distributed to the dependent lung and the filling of the right and left lung was more homogeneous. With increasing <b>V</b> (<b>T)</b> and maintained normal EEL (FRC), ventilation was preferentially distributed to the dependent lung and regional filling became more inhomogeneous (p <  0. 05).

40|$|SUMMARY Male albino rabbits {{received}} continuous (24 hr/day) {{infusions of}} angiotensin II (AH) at doses of 1 or 3 Mg/hr into a lateral cerebral ventricle (i. <b>v.</b> <b>t.)</b> for 10 consecutive days. Infusions were {{preceded by a}} 5 -day control period and followed by a 5 -day recovery period. Water intake, urine output, water "balance" (water intake minus urine output), urinary sodium and potassium excretions were determined daily. Arterial pressure, heart rate, plasma electrolytes (sodium and potassium), plasma volume, and extracellular fluid vol-ume were determined at 5 -day intervals. Chronic i. <b>v.</b> <b>t.</b> infusion of AH resulted in reversible, dose-dependent in-creases in arterial pressure, water intake, and urinary sodium excretion, and decreases in plasma sodium, plasma potassium, and water balance. Infusions of normal saline i. <b>v.</b> <b>t.</b> (n = 5) did not significantly alter {{any of the above}} values. Intravenous infusion of the same doses of AH raised arterial pressure to a similar degree as that from i. <b>v.</b> <b>t.</b> administration, but did not significantly affect any of the other measured variables. In an addi-tional group of 10 rabbits, AH was infused at 3 Mg/nr '•*•* • for 5 days, and the acute cardiovascular actions of i. <b>v.</b> <b>t.</b> saralasin (10 fig), i. v. saralasin (4 Mg/kg/min), and "total " autonomic blockade were compared to the effects of these treatments in five saline-infused rabbits. No significant differences in responses of the two groups were found. In another series of 10 rabbits, 5 -day i. <b>v.</b> <b>t.</b> infusion of All (3 Mg/hr) was shown to be asso-ciated with increased pressor sensitivity to norepinephrine, but not to AH or vasopressin. A similar experiment in four additional rabbits revealed that plasma vasopressin concentration was not altered by i. <b>v.</b> <b>t.</b> infusion of AH. We conclude that chronic i. <b>v.</b> <b>t.</b> infusion of AH in rabbits can cause a sustained hypertension that is not de-pendent on salt or water retention, "leak " of AH into the peripheral vasculature, increased release of vaso-pressin in the circulation, or increased autonomic nervous system activity...|$|R

Variability estimation of NWFET is essential to design the next generation logic circuits.
