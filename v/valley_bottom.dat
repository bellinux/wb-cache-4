5|$|One-thousand years ago, the nomadic Timbisha (formerly called Shoshone {{and also}} known as Panamint or Koso) moved into the area and hunted game and {{gathered}} mesquite beans along with pinyon pine nuts. Because of the wide altitude differential between the <b>valley</b> <b>bottom</b> and the mountain ridges, especially on the west, the Timbisha practiced a vertical migration pattern. Their winter camps were located near water sources in the valley bottoms. As {{the spring and summer}} progressed and the weather warmed, grasses and other plant food sources ripened at progressively higher altitudes. November found them {{at the very top of}} the mountain ridges where they harvested pine nuts before moving back to the <b>valley</b> <b>bottom</b> for winter.|$|E
5|$|The town is sited on {{the hills}} {{adjoining}} the flood plain of the River Nene. In the predominantly agrarian medieval period, this combination of access to fertile, if flood-prone, <b>valley</b> <b>bottom</b> soils and drier (but heavier and more clay-rich) hillside/ hilltop soils {{seems to have been}} good for a mixed agricultural base. The clay-rich hilltop soils are primarily a consequence of blanketing of the area with boulder clay or glacial till during the recent glaciations. On the valley sides and valley floor however, these deposits have been largely washed away in the late glacial period, and in the <b>valley</b> <b>bottom</b> extensive deposits of gravels were laid down, which have largely been exploited for building aggregate in the last century.|$|E

Also, on Anguilla, residents in the Sandy Ground, <b>Valley</b> <b>Bottom,</b> Welches and Mount Fortune areas were placed under evacuation orders. Shelters were opened throughout the island for those in need of shelter. Schools and government offices were also closed and visitors were told to leave the island.|$|E

5|$|In April 1761, tablets {{dating from}} the Roman period {{were found in the}} Rivelin Valley south of Stannington, close to the likely course of the Templeborough to Brough-on-Noe road.

5|$|The {{earliest}} tombs {{were located}} in cliffs {{at the top of}} scree slopes, under storm-fed waterfalls (KV34 and KV43). As these locations were filled, burials descended to the valley floor, gradually moving back up the slopes as the <b>valley</b> <b>bottom</b> filled with debris. This explains the location of the tombs KV62 and KV63 buried in the valley floor.|$|E
5|$|Many {{men were}} {{infected}} with malaria, and the regiment was periodically rotated {{away from the}} <b>valley</b> <b>bottom</b> to the western hills. Their first move back west was on the 16 May, when they moved to the brigade camp site near Talaat Ed Dumm, remaining there for the next thirteen days. On 30 May they moved to Solomon's Pools, {{to the south of}} Bethlehem. On 14 June the regiment returned to the front line at Ain Ed Duk, two miles north of Jericho. There they established observation posts to monitor Turkish activity, remaining until they were relieved on 30 June.|$|E

25|$|The first prehistoric lake {{to follow}} the Sedom Lagoon is named Lake Amora, {{followed}} by Lake Lisan and finally by the Dead Sea. The water levels and salinity of these lakes have either risen or fallen as an effect of the tectonic dropping of the <b>valley</b> <b>bottom,</b> and due to climate variation. As the climate became more arid, Lake Lisan finally shrank and became saltier, leaving the Dead Sea as its last remainder.|$|E
25|$|Little Langdale Tarn {{was several}} times larger {{at the end}} of the last ice age, the lost area having become filled with {{sediment}} and resulted in the flat farmland beside the current lake. The catchment area is a sheepfarm of rough grassland and sphagnum bog in the <b>valley</b> <b>bottom</b> and surrounding fellside. Sediment cores taken at the lake show a top layer of brown organic sediment followed by a grey coloured minerogenic layer rich in copper from the mining activities at Greenburn. There is an obvious increase in the sediment accumulation rate with time, the major source being peat pipes and sheep grazing close to Wrynose Beck, a tributary of the Brathay.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} move logs from the plateau above the Lower river, Adams River Lumber {{constructed}} several flumes. [...] The flumes were elevated wooden troughs filled with water that floated logs down to the <b>valley</b> <b>bottom.</b> [...] The largest of these was at Bear Creek. [...] It incorporated trestles up to [...] high and was capable of moving [...] of logs per month. [...] It was the largest flume in North America at its peak.

50|$|At Goroka, mean {{humidity}} {{varies from}} 87% at 09:00 hours to 57% at 15:00 hours. Associated with this typical cycling of cloud movement {{found in the}} Highlands {{in the early morning}} <b>valley</b> slopes and <b>bottom</b> are submerged in fog with high hills and ranges protruding into clear sunlight. As the day progresses the fog lifts from the valleys and clouds begin to form on the ranges frequently with associated local convectional storms. Towards the evening the cloud extends from the ranges to the valleys and with cooling sinks to <b>valley</b> <b>bottoms.</b> This cycle of afternoon cloud and storm on the ranges and morning fog in the <b>valley</b> <b>bottoms,</b> where airstrips are located, makes the maintenance of flight schedules difficult.|$|R

500|$|The {{presence}} of a shallow (less than 100-metre / 330ft) difference between the altitude of the <b>valley</b> <b>bottom</b> of the southern glacial valley, and its shoulders indicates past low-volume glaciation. Five different moraine stages between [...] and [...] altitude have been identified. Striated rocks and roche moutonnées are also present in the area. Based on helium-3 surface exposure dating, these moraines originated from Pleistocene glacier fluctuations between 65,000 and 14,000 years ago. The lowest of the moraines, and thus the largest extent of glaciation, coincides with the highstand of the [...] "Lake Tauca" [...] lake episode 16,000-14,000 years ago, where the Altiplano was covered by a large lake. Rapid deglaciation occurred after the disappearance of Lake Tauca 14,000 years ago. During the Tauca episode, water levels rose in the lakes around Uturunku.|$|E
500|$|In February the ANZAC Mounted Division {{was ordered}} to cross over to the British right flank, to conduct {{operations}} in the Jordan Valley by first capturing Jericho. By 19 February the regiment was east of Bethlehem and at 09:30 started toward Jericho along what was described as [...] "little more than a goat track". At times the track was so steep that the men had to dismount and lead their horses by hand. After stopping overnight, the regiment set out again as the vanguard at 04:30, moving in single file. Soon afterwards, Turkish guns opened fire on them from two hills, Kaneitera and Kalimun, which could dominate their approach. Upon reaching the <b>valley</b> <b>bottom,</b> the regiment spread out {{to provide a more}} difficult target. Moving forward under Turkish artillery and machine-gun fire, the regiment galloped from cover to cover by troops. This continued until around midday when the 11th Squadron got close enough to assault a Turkish position on the right of the valley. At the same time, the 3rd and 4th Squadrons were advancing in the centre and to the left. Elsewhere the Australian light horse brigades and British infantry were having similar problems. Eventually the British secured a position that allowed then to bring fire onto the Turkish defences in front of the regiment, forcing them to retire further up the Kalimun hill. The regiment's horse holders brought the mounts forward and the regiment charged the position on horseback. The Turkish forces retired, but kept the hill now occupied by the regiment under an artillery barrage.|$|E
