5|$|Regarding the {{taxability}} {{of income}} {{in connection with}} events or activities not involving a government privilege or franchise, the United States Supreme Court stated in United States v. Sullivan that gains from illegal traffic in liquor {{are subject to the}} Federal income tax. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Rutkin <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> States that the receipt of money obtained by extortion is taxable as income to the wrongdoer. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in James <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> States that the receipt of money obtained through embezzlement is taxable as income to the wrongdoer, even though the wrongdoer is required to return the money to its owner.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{handed the}} ACLU two key {{victories}} in 1957, in Watkins <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> States and Yates <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> States, {{both of which}} undermined the Smith Act and {{marked the beginning of}} the end of communist party membership inquiries. In 1965, the Supreme Court produced some decisions, including Lamont v. Postmaster General (in which the plaintiff was Corliss Lamont, a former ACLU board member), which upheld fifth amendment protections and brought an end to restrictions on political activity.|$|E
5|$|Three United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} in 1919 each upheld convictions under laws against {{certain kinds of}} anti-war speech. In 1919, the Court upheld the conviction of Socialist Party leader Charles Schenck for publishing anti-war literature. In Debs <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> States, the court upheld the conviction of Eugene Debs. While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in Abrams <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> States, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote an important dissent which has gradually been absorbed as an American principle: he urged the court to treat freedom of speech as a fundamental right, which should rarely be restricted.|$|E

5|$|When Harlan was a Circuit Judge in 1955, he {{authorized}} the decision upholding {{the conviction of}} leaders of the Communist Party USA (including Elizabeth Gurley Flynn) under the Smith Act. The ruling {{was based on the}} previous Supreme Court's decisions, by which the Court of Appeals was bound. Later, when he was a Supreme Court justice, Harlan, however, wrote an opinion overturning the conviction of Communist Party activists as unconstitutional in the case of Yates <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> States. Another such case was Watkins <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E
5|$|Bad Elk <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> States, 177 U.S. 529 (1900), was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that an {{individual}} had the right to use force to resist an unlawful arrest and was entitled to a jury instruction to that effect.|$|E
5|$|Debs appealed his {{conviction}} to the Supreme Court. In its ruling on Debs <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> States, the court examined several statements Debs had made regarding World War I and socialism. While Debs had carefully worded his speeches {{in an attempt}} to comply with the Espionage Act, the Court found he had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and military recruitment. Among other things, the Court cited Debs' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. stated in his opinion that little attention was needed since Debs' case was essentially {{the same as that of}} Schenck <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> States, in which the Court had upheld a similar conviction.|$|E

5|$|Enforcement {{of federal}} civil rights law in the South created {{numerous}} peonage cases, which slowly traveled up through the judiciary. The Supreme Court ruled in Clyatt <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> States (1905) that peonage was involuntary servitude. It held that although employers sometimes described their workers' entry into contract as voluntary, the servitude of peonage was always (by definition) involuntary.|$|E
5|$|Following Rider and Hewecker, {{certificates}} of division {{continued to be}} issued in civil cases.

5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate: A Biography of the First Amendment is a 2007 non-fiction book by {{journalist}} Anthony Lewis {{about freedom}} of speech, {{freedom of the}} press, freedom of thought, and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The book starts by quoting the First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from creating legislation which limits free speech or freedom of the press. Lewis traces the evolution of civil liberties in the U.S. through key historical events. He {{provides an overview of}} important free speech case law, including U.S. Supreme Court opinions in Schenck <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> States (1919), Whitney v. California (1927), United States v. Schwimmer (1929), New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), and New York Times Co. <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> States (1971).|$|E
5|$|Further, the Court {{disapproved of}} the judge's having asked the jury for the {{proportions}} of their deadlock (even {{though he did not}} ask how many were for conviction and how many were for acquittal). In Brasfield <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> States (1926), citing Burton, the Court held that such was reversible error, regardless of whether the defendant objected in the trial court.|$|E
