A person who chases eclipses is known as an umbraphile, meaning shadow lover. Umbraphiles travel for eclipses and use various tools to help view the sun including solar <b>viewing</b> <b>glasses,</b> also known as eclipse glasses, as well as telescopes.|$|E

50|$|Until 2011, home 3D {{television}} and home 3D computer primarily used active shutter glasses with LCD or plasma displays. TV manufacturers (LG, Vizio) have introduced displays with horizontal polarizing stripes overlaying the screen. The stripes alternate polarization with each line. This permits using relatively inexpensive passive <b>viewing</b> <b>glasses,</b> {{similar to those}} for movies. The principal disadvantage is that each polarization can display only half as many scanning lines.|$|E
50|$|Major {{repairs to}} the {{observatory}} dome were undertaken, {{thanks to the}} profits made {{from the sale of}} eclipse <b>viewing</b> <b>glasses</b> for the 1994 solar eclipse. Unused office and storage space was converted into exhibit rooms, a children’s play area and a small gift shop. In September 1999 the original 69 in telescope mirror was retrieved from COSI (where it had been sitting in a closet for over a decade) and placed on display.|$|E
50|$|While {{it is not}} {{possible}} to create a stereo image on a standard display without special equipment, it is possible to create an image with enhanced texture and depth. The parallax scanning lens technology creates autostereoscopic moving images with enhanced texture and depth on standard displays (television, movie screens and computer monitors) without the necessity of special screens or the use of <b>viewing</b> <b>glasses.</b> Images can be recorded on normal film or videotape using industry standard camera systems. The image depth enhancement is accomplished entirely by the lens using parallax scanning technology.|$|E

5000|$|However, a {{large number}} of unsafe {{filtering}} glasses began to proliferate on websites such as Amazon.com during the lead-up to the eclipse, including those that claimed to have ISO certification but did not actually undergo testing or had incomplete certification information, and those that were counterfeits of those from vendors the AAS considered reputable such as, in particular, American Paper Optics, which published information detailing the differences between its glasses and counterfeits. On July 27, 2017, Amazon began to require that all eclipse viewing products sold on its website have a submission of origin and safety information, and proof of an accredited ISO certification. In mid-August 2017, Amazon recalled and pulled listings for eclipse <b>viewing</b> <b>glasses</b> that [...] "may not comply with industry standards", and issued refunds to those that had purchased them.|$|E
5000|$|Virgin {{created the}} game on a budget of $1 million, {{initially}} titling it Escape from Quest World. Developers recycled fifty minutes of footage and art from six season one episodes to construct a new story concerning alien artifacts and an alien's liberation from an autopsy at The Pentagon. Virgin handled all marketing, sales, and distribution, while Turner helped cross-promote the game. Turner New Media announced that Virgin's [...] "non-violent adventure games suitable for pre-teen girls and boys, fits...our vision of what family entertainment should be." [...] Virgin designed certain segments in 3D and included special Chromatek plastic <b>viewing</b> <b>glasses</b> with game copies. Footage voices were dubbed over by Michael Banyaer as Hadji, Charles Howerton as Dr. Quest, and the season two cast. Virgin hoped the game would provide 20-25 hours of game play for adults and 80-100 for children.|$|E
5000|$|The Zutons' debut album, Who Killed...... The Zutons? was {{released}} in April 2004, and initially reached No. 13 in the UK album chart. However, after nearly a year later, it managed to move up to No. 9 in early 2005. The LP had a specially printed 3-D cover and came with Zutons 3-D <b>viewing</b> <b>glasses,</b> which many fans then wore to their concerts. Early copies of the album also included a bonus 4-track CD of alternative versions of their songs. The album was critically acclaimed and was a nominee for the 2004 Mercury Music Prize. The band themselves were nominated for the British Breakthrough Act award at the 2005 BRIT Awards. The album was later re-issued following the single [...] "Don't Ever Think (Too Much)", with that song being added as track 13. The track [...] "Confusion" [...] was used in a Peugeot 307 car advert in the UK during 2004-2005. In the United States, the song [...] "Pressure Point" [...] was featured in a commercial for Levi's. This song was also featured in the video game MVP Baseball 2005. The album went on to sell 581,081 copies by July 2006.|$|E

40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{for testing}} and evaluating the spray pattern of {{high pressure fuel}} injector elements for use in supplying fuel to combustion engines is presented. Prior art fuel injector elements were normally tested by use of low pressure apparatuses which did not provide a purge to prevent mist from obscuring the injector element or to prevent frosting of the view windows; could utilize only one fluid during each test; and had their viewing ports positioned one hundred eighty (180 deg) apart, thus preventing optimum use of laser diagnostics. The high pressure fluid injector test apparatus includes an upper hub, an upper weldment or housing, a first clamp and stud/nut assembly for securing the upper hub to the upper weldment, a standoff assembly within the upper weldment, a pair of window housings having <b>view</b> <b>glasses</b> within the upper weldment, an injector block assembly and purge plate within the upper weldment for holding an injector element to be tested and evaluated, a lower weldment or housing, a second clamp and stud/nut assembly for securing the lower weldment to the upper hub, a third clamp and stud/nut assembly for securing the lower hub to the lower weldment, mechanisms for introducing fluid under high pressure for testing an injector element, and mechanisms for purging the apparatus to prevent frosting of <b>view</b> <b>glasses</b> within the window housings and to permit unobstructed viewing of the injector element...|$|R
40|$|The {{representation}} of stereoscopic video on a display is typically enabled either by using active shutter or polarizing <b>viewing</b> <b>glasses</b> {{in the television}} sets and displays available for end users. It is likely that in some usage situations some viewers do not wear <b>viewing</b> <b>glasses</b> at all times and hence it would be desirable if the stereoscopic video content could be tuned in the rendering device {{in such a manner}} that it could be simultaneously watched with and without <b>viewing</b> <b>glasses</b> with an acceptable quality. In this thesis, a novel video rendering technique is proposed and implemented in the post-processing stage which enables good quality both stereoscopic and traditional 2 D video perception of the same content. This has been accomplished by manipulating of one view in the stereoscopic video by making it more similar to the other view {{in order to reduce the}} ghosting artifact perceived when the content is watched without <b>viewing</b> <b>glasses</b> while stereoscopic perception is maintained. The proposed technique includes three steps: disparity selection, contrast adjustment, and low-pass-filtering. Through an extensive series of subjective tests, the proposed approach has been evaluated to show that stereoscopic content can be viewed without glasses with an acceptable quality. The proposed methods resulted in a lower bitrate stereoscopic video stream requiring a smaller bandwidth for broadcasting...|$|E
