50|$|The {{amount of}} land held under Certificates of Claim was still in excess of 600,000 acres in 1948, when a Land Planning Commission {{reviewed}} landownership, but the future of many estates was in doubt by then and at independence in 1964 only 422,000 acres of European-owned estates remained, mainly tea estates, not all held under Certificates of Claim.

40|$|Tradable green {{certificate}} (TGC) schemes {{have been developed}} and tested in several countries to foster market-driven penetration of renewable energy sources. Another well-known and widely analysed type of market–based instrument is the tradable CO 2 permit. The first international CO 2 emission trading scheme will soon start in the European Union (EU). Recently the attention of policy makers has been attracted {{by the possibility of}} introducing tradable certificates for energy savings (TCES) to stimulate energy efficiency investments and achieve national energy efficiency targets. TCES schemes have been recently introduced in Italy and the UK. However, there is a debate over the effectiveness and applicability of this instrument. The paper describes the concept of a TCES scheme in the EU policy context. It discusses the main elements of a TCES scheme: the creation of the market and of the demand (eligible actions and technologies), the trading rules (<b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificates,</b> banking, borrowing), the possible cost-recovery mechanisms, and institutional infrastructure and processes to support the scheme (measurement and verification, penalty for non-compliance) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} of the {{systematic}} stability monitoring of certified reference materials (CRMs) for the mass fractions of metal species. Materials are tested regularly for the mass fractions of organotin, organomercury, organolead and organoarsenic species. Evaluation is based on ratios of results on samples stored under normal conditions and under even safer conditions (‘‘reference stock’’) to eliminate the effects of laboratory-to-laboratory variation. Of all results in this study, the results of organotin measurements show the highest relative standard deviations (up to 45 %). Determination of methylmercury in sediment and fish is possible with much better precision (standard deviations of reproducibility below 5 %). The accuracies of determinations of trimethyllead and organoarsenic species are slightly worse but still below 10 %. The data confirmed stability since production (i. e. up to 13 years). However, shelf lives cannot be extended into the future based on these data, as uncertainty contributions for stability need {{to be included in}} the uncertainty budgets of CRMs to allow positive demonstration of the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificates.</b> Estimation of typical measurement uncertainties based on the data obtained from stability monitoring shows that potential degradation is negligible compared to uncertainties typical for this kind of measurement, demonstrating that the materials are still sufficiently reliable to demonstrate laboratory proficiency.

40|$|Certificate status {{validation}} {{is a hard}} {{problem in}} general but it is particularly complex in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) because we require solutions to manage both the lack of fixed infrastructure inside the MANET and the possible absence of connectivity to trusted authorities when the certification validation has to be performed. In this sense, certificate acquisition is usually assumed as an initialization phase. However, certificate validation is a critical operation since the node needs to check the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> in real-time, that is, when a particular certificate {{is going to be}} used. In such MANET environments, it may happen that the node is placed {{in a part of the}} network that is disconnected from the source of status data at the moment the status checking is required. Proposals in the literature suggest the use of caching mechanisms so that the node itself or a neighbour node has some status checking material (typically on-line status responses or lists of revoked certificates). However, to the best of our knowledge the only criterion to evaluate the cached (obsolete) material is the time. In this paper, we analyse how to deploy a certificate status checking PKI service for hybrid MANET and we propose a new criterion based on risk to evaluate cached status data that is much more appropriate and absolute than time because it takes into account the revocation process.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new on-line certificate validation method which provides {{higher degree of}} security, scalability, and interoperability than do the pre-existing approaches. It combines two basic data structures for certificate revocation, Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and the authenticated dictionary such as Certificate Revocation Tree (CRT), into a single framework by utilizing the component matching enabled Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) service. With the new method, end entities that want to check the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> can request an extended LDAP search operation with a component matching assertion against all revoked certificate components in a CRL and check whether a revoked certificate having the asserted serial number is found. In order to ensure strong security without requiring trusted directories, CRLs are represented as an authenticated dictionary when decoded from Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) to an internal ASN. 1 representation. The information required to construct the authenticated dictionary is conveyed from the Certificate Authority (CA) via a new CRL extension. The proposed method facilitates a number of advantages over the previous approaches like Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) : 1) it enables higher security {{because it does not}} require trusted entities other than the CA such as trusted LDAP servers and trusted OCSP responders; 2) it improves scalability and performance because it does not require responses to be signed as in OCSP; 3) it can interoperate well with the existing CRL framework; and 4) it does not need support for additional protocols for on-line certificate validation because it is built on LDAP which is the main access method to download CRLs. The proposed method can also be used as a CRL backend of OCSP to offload CRL management and to enhance its trust model. I...|$|E
40|$|Objective to {{identify}} and assess the share of counterfeit products in the total volume of alcohol and tobacco products in the consumer market of Tatarstan Republic which will allow the inspection bodies to deal more effectively to prevent the spreading of counterfeit products. 	Methods the research proposed in this paper used methods of probability theory and mathematical statistics and the method of sampling analysis of certificates for products in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of Rosstandart. 	Results basing on a sampling of certificates for products directly from retail outlets analysis of the state alcohol and tobacco consumer market of Tatarstan was carried out. Improper filling of {{the form of the}} certificate for products was identified violating all existing norms and laws which are strictly prescribed in technical regulations. On the basis of these violations the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> for products was assessed and the conclusion was made about the products quality. The share of counterfeit alcohol and tobacco products in the total sales in the consumer market was assessed. The shortcomings of the inspection authorities to detect counterfeit products were identified. 	Scientific novelty the consumer market was researched basing on the method of sampling using probability theory and mathematical statistics to estimate the share of counterfeit alcohol and tobacco products in the consumer market of Tatarstan. The error sampling for counterfeit products in the consumer market was defined. 	Practical significance the obtained results will allow the inspection authorities to better and more accurately identify counterfeit goods and to restrict the access of counterfeit alcohol and tobacco products to the consumer market of Tatarstan.
