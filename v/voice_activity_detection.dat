40|$|Detecting when {{voice is}} or is not present is an {{outstanding}} prob-lem for speech transmission, enhancement and recognition. Here we present a novel multichannel source activity detector that ex-ploits the spatial localization of the target audio source. The detector uses an array signal processing technique to maximize the signal-to-interference ratio for the target source thus decreas-ing the <b>activity</b> <b>detection</b> error rate. We compare our two-channel <b>voice</b> <b>activity</b> detector (VAD) with the AMR voice detection algo-rithms on real data recorded in a noisy car environment. The new algorithm shows improvements in error rates of 55 - 70 % compared to the state-of-the-art adaptive multi-rate algorithm AMR 2 used in present voice transmission technology. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} {{improving}} the noise preprocessor (NPP) of the low-rate speech coder MELPe using information from the non-acoustic General Electromagnetic Motion Sensor (GEMS). A generalized linear model approach is proposed to improve the <b>voice</b> <b>activity</b> estimation both in the frame-level time domain and in the bin-level frequency domain with GEMS and context features. HMM based speech recognition techniques are also investigated to drive the estimators. The improved <b>voice</b> <b>activity</b> parameter estimators are shown to have significantly less error than the estimates from MELPe NPP. The improved frame-level <b>voice</b> <b>activity</b> estimator achieves 66 % reduction in error. The improved bin-level <b>voice</b> <b>activity</b> estimates has more than 50 % error reduction. With an optimal spectral amplitude estimation algorithm instead of the MM-LSA algorithm used in MELPe NPP, and the improved <b>voice</b> <b>activity</b> parameters, the processed noisy speech has much less residue noise and higher intelligibility in informal listening tests. ...|$|R
40|$|In-house {{automatic}} <b>activity</b> <b>detection</b> {{is highly}} important toward the automatic {{evaluation of the}} resident's cognitive state. However, current <b>activity</b> <b>detection</b> systems suffer from the demand for on-site acquisition of large amounts of ground truth data for training purposes, which poses a major obstacle to their real-world applicability. In this paper, focusing on resident location trajectory-based activity recognition through limited amount of low-cost cameras, we introduce a novel scheme for automatic ground truth data generation, via simulation of resident trajectories based on formal descriptions of activities. Additionally, we present an <b>activity</b> <b>detection</b> scheme capable of learning activity patterns from such synthetic ground truth data. Experimental results show that our methodology achieves <b>activity</b> <b>detection</b> performance that is comparable to state-of-art methods, while suppressing the need for any actual ground truth recordings, thus boosting the real-world applicability of practical <b>activity</b> <b>detection</b> systems.

50|$|<b>Voice</b> <b>{{activity}}</b> <b>detection</b> (VAD), {{also known}} as speech activity detection or speech detection, is a technique used in speech processing in which {{the presence or absence}} of human speech is detected. The main uses of VAD are in speech coding and speech recognition. It can facilitate speech processing, and can also be used to deactivate some processes during non-speech section of an audio session: it can avoid unnecessary coding/transmission of silence packets in Voice over Internet Protocol applications, saving on computation and on network bandwidth.|$|E
50|$|The {{algorithm}} includes <b>voice</b> <b>activity</b> <b>detection</b> (VAD) {{followed by}} an elaborate frame classification scheme. Silence/background noise and stationary unvoiced frames are represented by spectrum-modulated noise and coded at 1/4 or 1/8 rate. The SMV uses 4 subframes for full rate and two/three subframes for half rate. The stochastic (fixed) codebook structure is also elaborate and uses sub-codebooks each tuned for {{a particular type of}} speech. The sub-codebooks have different degrees of pulse sparseness (more sparse for noise like excitation). SMV scores a high of 3.6 MOS at full rate with clean speech.|$|E
50|$|Some modern {{telephone}} systems (such as wireless and VoIP) use <b>voice</b> <b>activity</b> <b>detection</b> (VAD), {{a form of}} squelching where low volume {{levels are}} ignored by the transmitting device. In digital audio transmissions, this saves bandwidth of the communications channel by transmitting nothing when the source volume is under a certain threshold, leaving only louder sounds (such as the speaker's voice) to be sent. However, improvements in background noise reduction technologies can occasionally result in the complete removal of all noise. Although maximizing call quality is of primary importance, exhaustive removal of noise may not properly simulate the typical behavior of terminals on the PSTN system.|$|E
