Up to twenty five viruses have been described as being able to infect narcissi. These include the Narcissus common latent <b>virus</b> (NCLV, Narcissus mottling-associated <b>virus),</b> Narcissus latent <b>virus</b> (NLV, Narcissus mild mottle <b>virus)</b> which causes green mottling near leaf tips, Narcissus degeneration <b>virus</b> (NDV), Narcissus late season yellows <b>virus</b> (NLSYV) which occurs after flowering, streaking the leaves and stems, Narcissus mosaic <b>virus,</b> Narcissus yellow stripe <b>virus</b> (NYSV, Narcissus yellow streak <b>virus),</b> Narcissus tip necrosis <b>virus</b> (NTNV) which produces necrosis of leaf tips after flowering and Narcissus white streak <b>virus</b> (NWSV).|$|E

50|$|Animal <b>viruses</b> are <b>viruses</b> that infect animals. <b>Viruses</b> infect all {{cellular}} {{life and}} although <b>viruses</b> infect every animal, plant and protist species, each {{has their own}} specific range of <b>viruses</b> that often infect only that species.|$|R
5|$|After the <b>virus</b> {{enters the}} body {{there is a}} period of rapid viral replication, leading to an {{abundance}} of <b>virus</b> in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million <b>virus</b> particles per milliliter of blood. This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling <b>virus</b> levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the <b>virus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} by some that artificial gene synthesis {{could be used}} to recreate the <b>virus</b> from existing digital genomes, for use in biological warfare. Insertion of the synthesized smallpox DNA into existing related pox viruses could theoretically be used to recreate the <b>virus.</b> The first step to mitigating this risk, it has been suggested, should be to destroy the remaining <b>virus</b> stocks so as to enable unequivocal criminalization of any possession of the <b>virus.</b>|$|E
5|$|During viral replication, the {{integrated}} DNA provirus is transcribed into RNA, {{some of which}} then undergo RNA splicing to produce mature mRNAs. These mRNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into the regulatory proteins Tat (which encourages new <b>virus</b> production) and Rev. As the newly produced Rev protein accumulates in the nucleus, it binds to full-length, unspliced copies of <b>virus</b> RNAs and allows them to leave the nucleus. Some of these full-length RNAs function as new copies of the <b>virus</b> genome, while others function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins Gag and Env. Gag proteins bind to copies of the <b>virus</b> RNA genome to package them into new <b>virus</b> particles.|$|E

40|$|Avian {{influenza}} <b>viruses</b> {{are highly}} contagious, extremely variable <b>viruses</b> that are widespread in birds. Wild birds in aquatic habitats {{are thought to}} be their natural reservoir hosts, but domesticated poultry and other birds can also be infected. Most <b>viruses</b> cause only mild disease in poultry, and are called low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) <b>viruses.</b> Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) <b>viruses</b> can develop from certain LPAI <b>viruses,</b> usually while they are circulating in poultry flocks. HPAI <b>viruses</b> can kill up to 90 - 100 % of the flock, and cause epidemics that may spread rapidly, devastate the poultry industry and result in severe trade restrictions. In poultry, the presence of LPAI <b>viruses</b> capable of evolving into HPAI <b>viruses</b> can also affect international trade. Avian influenza <b>viruses</b> can occasionally affect mammals, including humans, usually after close contact with infected poultry. While infections in people are often limited to conjunctivitis or mild respiratory disease, some <b>viruses</b> can cause severe illness. In particular, Asian lineage H 5 N 1 HPAI <b>viruses</b> have caused rare but lifethreatening infections, now totaling nearly 850 laboratory-confirmed cases since 1997, and H 7 N 9 LPAI <b>viruses</b> have caused more than 600 serious human illnesses in China since 2013.

In rare cases, avian influenza <b>viruses</b> can become adapted to circulate in a mammalian species.
