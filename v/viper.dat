50|$|The {{foundation}} to Los <b>Vipers</b> was {{laid in the}} beginning of 1997, several months before Los <b>Vipers</b> was unveiled. The basis of Los <b>Vipers</b> was created when AAA formed a group where most of the members would go on to form Los <b>Vipers.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1999, Los <b>Vipers</b> {{split into}} two factions, with Abismo Negro leading a {{splinter}} group called Los <b>Vipers</b> Extreme consisting of Electroshock, Pentagón, Shiima, El Cuervo and Mini Abismo Negro while Cibernético created a group called Los <b>Vipers</b> Primera Clase (First Class <b>Vipers).</b> After less than two months, the angle was dropped and Los <b>Vipers</b> reunited. Not long after Los <b>Vipers</b> reunited, Cibernético formed a group called Lucha Libre Latina (LLL), a group intent on taking over AAA that was inspired by World Championship Wrestling's New World Order. Los <b>Vipers</b> became a subgroup within LLL, and Negro assumed leadership of Los <b>Vipers.</b> On May 2, 1999, Negro and Electroshock teamed up to defeat Perro Aguayo and Perro Aguayo, Jr. to win the Mexican National Tag Team Championship. Los <b>Vipers</b> held the tag team title for four months before losing it to the team of Haytor and the Panther.|$|R
5|$|El Toro {{has several}} {{similarities}} to <b>Viper,</b> the coaster that it replaced. The most obvious similarity is that El Toro uses Viper's station, {{the only part}} of <b>Viper</b> that was not torn down. The station previously held two <b>Viper</b> trains at once, with a loading platform in the front and an unloading platform in the rear. The ramp that was previously Viper's main exit is now used only for wheelchair access, as El Toro has a new exit {{on the other side of}} the station. During El Toro's construction, the station was gutted and an entirely new platform built. Like El Toro, <b>Viper</b> turned left out of the station before the lift hill and turned left at the top of the lift before the first drop.|$|E

5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the <b>viper</b> dogfish captures prey by {{protruding}} its jaws and impaling them with its teeth. Its impressive gape {{allows it to}} swallow relatively large fish whole. The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism, which is unlike that of other dogfish sharks. This shark gives birth to live young, which are nourished by yolk during gestation; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups. Small numbers of <b>viper</b> dogfish are caught incidentally in purse seines and bottom trawls. The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E

5|$|For testing purposes, a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley <b>Viper</b> jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an impeller was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design built into a bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility. It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with test data to show {{the viability of the}} concept. The original plan to initially test the <b>Viper</b> Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing. Unfortunately, testing was anything but smooth; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely ensconced in a booth constructed of bullet-proof glass and quarter-inch-thick steel. A final, disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a <b>Viper</b> jet engine running wild, convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary.|$|E

5|$|The <b>viper</b> dogfish feeds {{primarily}} on bony fishes, notably lanternfishes in the genera Benthosema and Diaphus, and also takes crustaceans. Its long jaws and slender teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting, {{in contrast to}} the short jaws and saw-like lower teeth of other dogfish sharks that are suited for excising chunks of meat. Prey is seized by a rapid extension of the jaws and swallowed whole; the shark can consume fish close to 40% as long as itself. The <b>viper</b> dogfish is the only dogfish species that lacks a suborbital muscle, which is normally responsible for pulling the jaws forward when biting. Jaw protrusion is instead effected by the hyomandibular bone, which is articulated to the skull in a manner that allows it to swing down and forward. This unique arrangement serves to increase the distance the shark can protrude its jaws, as well as the size of its gape both vertically and horizontally.|$|E

After managing only 7 wins out of a 51-game schedule, the <b>Vipers</b> finished with only 18 points, and the <b>Vipers</b> finished out of playoff contention for the third-consecutive year. The 1999-00 season would bring changes, and the <b>Vipers</b> produced talent with some local players, who were discarded from major junior hockey, especially the Ontario Hockey League. The records from the previous years were identical, but in different categories. Vaughan made the post-season {{for the first time in}} their short history, especially defeating the Pickering Panthers in four games and the Markham Waxers in 5 games. The Thornhill Rattlers were no match for the <b>Vipers</b> and lost the series in 4 games. The following seasons, the <b>Vipers</b> began to sink to the bottom of the standings and were fortunate to qualify for the playoffs, only to exit the first round.
