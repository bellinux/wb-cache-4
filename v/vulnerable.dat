5|$|Under the NatureServe {{conservation}} status system, A.viridimontanum is considered globally <b>vulnerable</b> (G3). It is considered imperiled (S2) in Vermont and <b>vulnerable</b> (S3) in Quebec; {{it has not}} yet been classified in Maine.|$|E
5|$|Cisco Systems has {{identified}} 78 {{of its products}} as <b>vulnerable,</b> including IP phone systems and telepresence (video conferencing) systems.|$|E
5|$|Controlled outages of <b>vulnerable</b> {{connection}} points (e.g., substations) or circuits until {{ash fall}} has subsided or for de-energised cleaning of equipment.|$|E
5|$|Jama wetland in Maizhokunggar County is <b>vulnerable</b> to grazing {{and climate}} change.|$|E
5|$|Kashyap {{serves as}} the Member of board of the NGO, Aangan, which helps protect <b>vulnerable</b> {{children}} around India.|$|E
5|$|Other {{diseases}} {{to which}} B.brownii is <b>vulnerable</b> include the parasitic fungus Armillaria luteobubalina and the aerial canker fungus Zythiostroma.|$|E
5|$|Over 152 {{species of}} birds are known or {{suspected}} {{to live in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, including the northern goshawk and the northern spotted owl, a <b>vulnerable</b> species. Bald eagles nest around Willow Lake. Amphibians such as the <b>vulnerable</b> Oregon spotted frog and the near threatened Cascades frog inhabit some regions of the watershed. Black-tailed deer, Roosevelt elk, cougars, and black bears are the most common of the 63 species of mammals found in the watershed. Fishers and American martens have also been spotted. The gray wolf and the <b>vulnerable</b> grizzly bear once lived in the watershed, but are now considered extirpated. Nineteen species of reptiles live in the area. Other sensitive species include the wolverine, the western pond turtle, the sandhill crane, and Townsend's big-eared bat.|$|E
5|$|Some hydrologists expect {{downstream}} riverbanks {{to become}} more <b>vulnerable</b> to flooding.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} this species as Near Threatened worldwide and <b>Vulnerable</b> {{in the northwestern}} Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. The American Fisheries Society has also assessed North American dusky shark populations as <b>Vulnerable.</b> Its very low reproductive rate renders the dusky shark extremely susceptible to overfishing.|$|E
5|$|The {{affected}} {{versions of}} OpenSSL are OpenSSL 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f (inclusive). Subsequent versions (1.0.1g and later) and previous versions (1.0.0 branch and older) are not <b>vulnerable.</b> Installations {{of the affected}} versions are <b>vulnerable</b> unless OpenSSL was compiled with -DOPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS.|$|E
5|$|The rodent {{repellant}} {{properties of}} Narcissus alkaloids have been utilised in horticulture to protect more <b>vulnerable</b> bulbs.|$|E
5|$|The servers of LastPass were <b>vulnerable,</b> {{but due to}} {{additional}} encryption and forward secrecy, potential attacks {{were not able to}} exploit this bug. However, LastPass recommended that its users change passwords for <b>vulnerable</b> websites.|$|E
5|$|The three extant manatee species (family Trichechidae) and the Dugong (family Dugongidae) {{are rated}} as <b>vulnerable</b> on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. All four are <b>vulnerable</b> to {{extinction}} from habitat loss and other negative impacts related to human {{population growth and}} coastal development. Steller's sea cow, extinct since 1786, was hunted to extinction by humans.|$|E
5|$|According to the IUCN and BirdLife International, seven {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} {{are considered to}} be <b>vulnerable</b> or worse and one is considered to be near threatened. Of these, two species—the red-vented cockatoo and the yellow-crested cockatoo—{{are considered to be}} critically endangered.|$|E
5|$|Advocating East Timor's {{integration}} with Indonesia and originally named Associacão Integraciacao de Timor Indonesia (Association for the Integration of Timor into Indonesia), APODETI expressed concerns that an independent East Timor {{would then be}} economically weak and <b>vulnerable.</b>|$|E
5|$|All {{enemies are}} {{protected}} by health, shields, armor, barriers, or a combination thereof. Each type of protection has its own vulnerabilities. For example, armor is usually <b>vulnerable</b> to powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and to weapons with a low rate of fire such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, shields are <b>vulnerable</b> to powers such as Overload and to rapid-firing weapons like submachine guns and assault rifles. Barriers are typically used by boss-type enemies and are <b>vulnerable</b> to certain weapons and powers. When the shields, armor, or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them. Other powers may temporary benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in bullet time. Powers do not require any sort of expendable resource; they only have a global refresh time period.|$|E
5|$|Alloxylon flammeum {{is listed}} nationally as <b>vulnerable</b> under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), which {{indicates}} {{that there is a}} high risk it will become extinct in the wild in the mid-term future. Before the establishment of the EPBC Act, it was, and currently remains, listed as <b>vulnerable</b> under the state-based Nature Conservation Act 1992. Furthermore, it was listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 1997. Most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and development. Remaining stands in protected areas are highly fragmented. Furthermore, plants in cultivation are likely to come from a limited genetic pool. With under 2% of its original extent remaining, the rainforest is threatened by invasive plants and grazing by feral and domestic animals.|$|E
5|$|Although both Pi Vell and Pi Jove are officially protected, {{they are}} easily {{accessible}} {{in an isolated}} wooded area, and therefore <b>vulnerable</b> to vandalism as well as natural hazards such as lightning and wildfire. Several proposals have been made {{over the years to}} improve the site.|$|E
5|$|Ambitious {{reporter}} Amy Harkin (Nancy McKeon) {{is stuck}} {{reporting on the}} heat wave while trying to find proof behind the scenes that Lexer and Midwest {{are responsible for the}} lack of sufficient power. The Secretary of Energy, Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president that the power grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters and that it is too <b>vulnerable</b> to attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of Lexer, has also repeatedly warned Lexer that their systems are too <b>vulnerable</b> to hackers, but the company is only interested in going with the cheapest options. He decides to blow the whistle on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the piece to air.|$|E
5|$|Anti-malware {{researchers}} also exploited Heartbleed {{to their own}} advantage in order to access secret forums used by cybercriminals. Studies were also conducted by deliberately setting up <b>vulnerable</b> machines. For example, on April 12, 2014, at least two independent researchers were able to steal private keys from an experimental server intentionally set up for that purpose by CloudFlare. Also, on April 15, 2014, J. Alex Halderman, a professor at University of Michigan, reported that his honeypot server, an intentionally <b>vulnerable</b> server designed to attract attacks in order to study them, had received numerous attacks originating from China. Halderman concluded that {{because it was a}} fairly obscure server, these attacks were probably sweeping attacks affecting large areas of the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Apart from filmmaking, Kashyap {{serves as}} the Member of board of the Mumbai-based NGO, Aangan, which helps protect <b>vulnerable</b> {{children}} around India. He {{is the founder of}} two film production companies: Anurag Kashyap Films, Phantom Films with partnership from directors Vikramaditya Motwane and Vikas Bahl and producer Madhu Mantena.|$|E
5|$|As of the species' {{most recent}} review in 2008, Kitti's hog-nosed bat is listed by the IUCN as <b>vulnerable,</b> with a {{downward}} population trend.|$|E
5|$|Atypical {{development}} of fearfulness, with a constitutional tendency either to excessive or inadequate fear reactions, {{might be necessary}} before an infant is <b>vulnerable</b> {{to the effects of}} poor attachment experiences.|$|E
5|$|Because of its slow {{reproductive}} rate, the {{dusky shark}} is very <b>vulnerable</b> to human-caused population depletion. This species is highly valued by commercial fisheries for its fins, used in shark fin soup, {{and for its}} meat, skin, and liver oil. It is also esteemed by recreational fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened worldwide and <b>Vulnerable</b> off the eastern United States, where populations have dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. The dusky shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans due to its large size, but there are few attacks attributable to it.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{species with}} a {{restricted}} range are especially <b>vulnerable</b> to human activities, and {{eight of the}} 26 bird species occurring only in the Northern Maluku Endemic Bird Area are threatened, including the invisible rail. Almost {{a quarter of all}} rail species have conservation concerns, and flightless island species are particularly at risk, at least 15 species having become extinct since 1600. The estimated population of the invisible rail is 3,500–15,000 birds, and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as <b>vulnerable</b> by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although this rail is so poorly known that it may be more common than the estimates suggest.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} listed as <b>vulnerable</b> by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, {{entanglement}} in fishing nets, and direct harvesting for their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine. Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are more <b>vulnerable</b> closer to shore. Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them.|$|E
5|$|Corals from seamounts {{are also}} <b>vulnerable,</b> {{as they are}} highly valued for making {{jewellery}} and decorative objects. Significant harvests have been produced from seamounts, often leaving coral beds depleted.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham, {{realising}} that an {{air attack}} could weaken the Italians, ordered {{an attack by}} the Formidables Albacore torpedo-bombers. A hit on the Vittorio Veneto slowed her temporarily and Iachino, realising his fleet was <b>vulnerable</b> without air cover, ordered his forces to retire. Cunningham gave the order to pursue the Italian Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Different tammar {{populations have}} {{varying levels of}} {{resistance}} to sodium fluoroacetate. Mainland Western tammars {{appear to be the}} most resistant, while those on Kangaroo Island are much more <b>vulnerable.</b> Tammars from New Zealand are also <b>vulnerable,</b> as the poison has been successfully used to control their populations. Tammars from East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island, which do not have plants containing sodium fluoroacetate, are less resistant than mainland Western tammars but are more resistant than those from Kangaroo Island. This suggests that tammars originated in South Australia and developed a resistance to sodium fluoroacetate when they reached Western Australia, where the poison is found in plants.|$|E
5|$|Fans {{were excited}} by the character's reveal, and {{professional}} players praised the balance of his move set. Other critics considered Doomfist too <b>vulnerable</b> to be viable, and insufficiently exciting to rekindle the interest of old players.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{the next}} two decades, the western reaches of Mysore {{remained}} <b>vulnerable</b> to attacks by the Coorg army. In the border district of Yelusavira, the Coorg and Mysore forces fought to a stalemate and, in the end, had to work out a tax sharing arrangement.|$|E
5|$|From 2005 to 2011 the palace, having earlier {{stood in}} <b>vulnerable</b> conditions, {{underwent}} a restoration project {{carried out by}} the Aga Khan Trust for Culture under the Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme. The palace now houses a hotel operated by Serena and a museum depicting the history and culture of Baltistan.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 {{the breed}} was {{identified}} as a <b>vulnerable</b> native breed by Kennel Club of Great Britain which are described as having annual registration figures of less than 300 per year. In 2008, only 56 puppies were registered.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{a report}} {{estimated}} that there are just 7,100 cheetahs in the wild {{and that they are}} rapidly heading towards extinction. The authors suggest an immediate re-categorisation of the species from <b>vulnerable</b> to endangered.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{the green}} rosella was rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered species. This {{was on the}} basis of its large range—greater than 20,000km2 (7700mi2)—and small rate of decline in population. The King Island {{subspecies}} is listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as <b>vulnerable,</b> and its population thought to number fewer than 500 birds. Around 70% of King Island's native vegetation has been cleared, and the remainder is highly fragmented and at risk of too-frequent bushfires. Like most species of parrots, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of <b>vulnerable</b> species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.|$|E
5|$|In 463 BC, Pericles was {{the leading}} {{prosecutor}} of Cimon, {{the leader of the}} conservative faction who was accused of neglecting Athens' vital interests in Macedon. Although Cimon was acquitted, this confrontation proved that Pericles' major political opponent was <b>vulnerable.</b>|$|E
