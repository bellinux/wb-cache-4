30|$|Iodometric {{method is}} one of the {{convenient}} and simple methods for determination of Se (IV) in solution. The reaction involves the oxidation of I− ions into I 2 by SeO 32 − and its subsequent reaction with excess I− to form I 3 −. In conventional iodometry, this liberated iodine is titrated with sodium thiosulphate using starch as an indicator (Vogel, 1989). Iodometric reaction provides many fold amplification of the signal (Zhang et al., 1998); however, there are chances of loss of liberated iodine during titration. These losses of iodine can be prevented if the liberated iodine is treated with an iodine selective reagent such as a dye giving a good optical response. In literature, certain iodine selective reagents have been used like p-amino-p 1 -methoxydiphenylamine, cetylpyridinium cation etc. (Revansiddappa & Kiran Kumar, 2001; Agrawal et al., 2009). Another possibility of measurement of liberated iodine is its preconcentration into a solid phase matrix that can further enhance the analytical capability of the method and can also prevent the loss of iodine during sample handling and manipulation. One such solid-phase matrix used in the literature is nafion membrane with suffused p-amino-p’-methoxydiphenylamine or <b>variamine</b> blue (<b>variamine</b> blue) dye in it (Coo et al., 1999). The method involved reacting selenite with potassium iodide to generate iodine gas, which reacts with <b>variamine</b> blue to form a violet colored species monitored spectrophotometrically.

30|$|There {{are various}} {{analytical}} methods for determination of iodate in seawater and iodized salt samples. Some {{of the recent}} methods include kinetic spectrophotometric methods (Ni and Wang 2007), flow injection analysis (Shabani et al. 2011), microspectrophotometry after liquid-phase microextraction (Pereira et al. 2010), using cadmium sulfide quantum dots as fluorescence probes (Tang et al. 2010), liquid-liquid microextraction by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (Gupta et al. 2011), ion chromatography with integrated amperometric detection (Babulal et al. 2010), transient isotachophoresis-capillary zone electrophoresis (Wang et al. 2009), gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Das et al. 2004), using polymer membrane selective for molecular iodine (Bhagat et al. 2008), and neutron activation analysis method (Bhagat et al. 2009). A non-suppressed ion chromatography with inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has been developed for the simultaneous determination of iodate and iodide in seawater (Zul et al. 2007). Most of the techniques are complex and involve sophisticated instruments and complex procedures. It is also observed that application of these analytical methods for iodate determination in table salt is complicated due {{to the presence of}} huge excess of chloride, for example, in the case of anion exchange chromatography with conductometric detection which requires the removal of large excess of chloride from the sample matrix (Kumar et al. 2001). Hence, development of a method that is selective for iodate and sensitive and requires simple and inexpensive experimental setup is of considerable scientific interest. Also, accurate determination of the contribution of iodine from table salt to total dietary intake requires novel methods. With this objective in the present work, a simple and rapid method for determination of iodate is described. Iodometric reaction between iodate, excess iodide, and acid has been used, and the liberated iodine is allowed to react with <b>variamine</b> blue (VB) dye to yield a violet-colored species with absorbance maxima at 550  nm. The developed method was applied to determine the iodate concentration in table salt samples obtained from local markets in and around Pune city in India. The kinetics of the method is very fast, and a large number of table salt samples can be screened for their iodate content in a short time. The iodate content thus determined by the developed method was compared with the iodate content determined by conventional iodometric titration. The method developed in the present work has advantages over conventional methods, for example, it is free from losses of iodine and it is interference free.|$|E
