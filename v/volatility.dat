40|$|This paper first {{examines}} {{the properties of}} the realized <b>volatilities</b> of US Dollar / Canadian Dollar spot exchange rate covering a time span of about three years and then the deseasonalized <b>volatilities</b> are estimated and forecasted using a fractionally-integrated model. The key feature of the realized <b>volatilities</b> is that they are model-free and also approximately measurement-error-free. More strikingly, the distribution of logarithmic realized volatilizes is approximately Gaussian. Our observations in this paper are consistent with previous studies. Usually a U-shaped pattern of the intraday <b>volatilities</b> should be observed due to opening-closure effects in the global market. We do not see a typical U-shaped pattern in the intraday <b>volatilities</b> for US Dollar / Canadian Dollar. The reasons are given in this paper. Because the intraday <b>volatilities</b> generated using the high frequency data shows this kind of intraday seasonality, we do a seasonal adjustment before estimation. After seasonal adjustment, we use ARFIMAX model to estimate and forecast the deseasonalized <b>volatilities</b> and the results are promising...|$|R
40|$|This study {{discusses}} how {{to compute}} and forecast long-term stock return <b>volatilities,</b> typically with a five-year horizon or longer, using credit derivatives, and how such <b>volatilities</b> {{can be used}} in different areas ranging from the valuation of employee stock options and other long-term derivatives to the construction of market-based fear gauges in selected countries or market segments. In the empirical part of the paper I focus on the European financial sector and find the credit-implied <b>volatilities</b> and fear gauges to behave well. The forecasting accuracy of the credit-implied <b>volatilities</b> is found to be better than that of horizon-matched historical <b>volatilities.</b> (c) 2014 The Authors.

40|$|Theories such as Merton (1987) {{predict a}} {{positive}} relation between idiosyncratic risk and expected return when investors do not diversify their portfolio. Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006, Journal of Finance 61, 259 - 299) however find that monthly stock returns are {{negatively related to}} the one-month lagged idiosyncratic <b>volatilities.</b> I show that idiosyncratic <b>volatilities</b> are time-varying and thus their findings {{should not be used}} to imply the relation between idiosyncratic risk and expected return. Using the exponential GARCH models to estimate expected idiosyncratic <b>volatilities,</b> I find a significantly positive relation between the estimated conditional idiosyncratic <b>volatilities</b> and expected returns. Further evidence suggests that Ang et al. ’s findings are largely explained by the return reversal of a subset of small stocks with high idiosyncratic <b>volatilities...</b>|$|R

25|$|Since {{the market}} crash of 1987, {{it has been}} {{observed}} that market implied <b>volatility</b> for options of lower strike prices are typically higher than for higher strike prices, suggesting that <b>volatility</b> is stochastic, varying both for time and for the price level of the underlying security. Stochastic <b>volatility</b> models have been developed including one developed by S.L. Heston. One principal advantage of the Heston model is that it can be solved in closed-form, while other stochastic <b>volatility</b> models require complex numerical methods.|$|E
40|$|There are {{few studies}} {{directly}} addressing exchange rate and inflation <b>volatilities,</b> {{and lack of}} consensus among them. However, this kind of study is necessary, especially because they can help monetary authorities to know price behavior better. This article analyses the relation between exchange rate and inflation <b>volatilities</b> using a bivariate GARCH model, and therefore modeling conditional <b>volatilities,</b> fact largely unexplored by the literature. We find a semi-concave relation between those series, and this nonlinearity may explain their apparently disconnection under a floating exchange rate system. The article also shows that traditional tests, with non-conditional <b>volatilities,</b> are not robust. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{simplest}} (put) moneyness is fixed-strike moneyness, where M=K, and {{the simplest}} call moneyness is fixed-spot moneyness, where M=S. These are {{also known as}} absolute moneyness, and correspond to not changing coordinates, instead using the raw prices as measures of moneyness; the corresponding <b>volatility</b> surface, with coordinates K and T (tenor) is the absolute <b>volatility</b> surface. The simplest non-trivial moneyness is the ratio of these, either S/K or its reciprocal K/S, which {{is known as the}} (spot) simple moneyness, with analogous forward simple moneyness. Conventionally the fixed quantity is in the denominator, while the variable quantity is in the numerator, so S/K for a single option and varying spots, and K/S for different options at a given spot, such as when constructing a <b>volatility</b> surface. A <b>volatility</b> surface using coordinates a non-trivial moneyness M and time to expiry τ is called the relative <b>volatility</b> surface (with respect to the moneyness M).|$|E

40|$|This study {{supplies}} {{new evidence}} regarding the predictive power of jumps for conditional market returns and <b>volatilities.</b> We change the constant jump intensity {{as in the}} LPW and Du models with time-varying intensity following an autoregressive conditional jump intensity (ARJI) process and a squared bessel (SB) process, and apply calibrated jump premiums to predict excess market returns and <b>volatilities.</b> We show that all calibrated jump premiums have significant predictive power in sample and out-of-sample. We find that in the U. S. market LPW’s model forecasts excess returns and <b>volatilities</b> better. The ARJI process of jump intensity predicts excess returns better, and SB process forecasts <b>volatilities</b> better. In the Australian market we find that, the model with ARJI process of jump intensity predicts Australian market returns and <b>volatilities</b> better.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is twofold. First, using five of the most {{actively}} traded stocks in the Brazilian financial market, this paper shows that the normality assumption commonly used in the risk management area to describe the distributions of returns standardized by <b>volatilities</b> is not compatible with <b>volatilities</b> estimated by EWMA or GARCH models. In sharp contrast, when the information contained in high frequency data is used to construct the realized volatilies measures, we attain the normality of the standardized returns, giving promise of improvements in Value at Risk statistics. We also describe the distributions of <b>volatilities</b> of the Brazilian stocks, showing that the distributions of <b>volatilities</b> are nearly lognormal. Second, we estimate a simple linear model to the log of realized <b>volatilities</b> that differs from the ones in other studies. The main difference is that we do not find evidence of long memory. The estimated model is compared with commonly used alternatives in an out-of-sample experiment...|$|R

25|$|An inverse ETF, {{like any}} {{leveraged}} ETF, needs to buy {{when the market}} rises and sell when it falls {{in order to maintain}} a fixed leverage ratio. This results in a <b>volatility</b> loss proportional to the market variance. Compared to a short position with identical initial exposure, the inverse ETF will therefore usually deliver inferior returns. The exception is if the market declines significantly on low <b>volatility</b> so that the capital gain outweighs the <b>volatility</b> loss. Such large declines benefit the inverse ETF because the relative exposure of the short position drops as the market fall.|$|E
25|$|However, the US real GDP growth rate, {{the real}} retail sales growth rate, and the {{inflation}} rate have all returned to roughly what they were before the Great Recession. Todd Clark has presented an empirical analysis which claims that <b>volatility,</b> in general, {{has returned to the}} same level as before the Great Recession. He concluded that while severe, the 2007 recession will in future be viewed as a temporary period {{with a high level of}} <b>volatility</b> in a longer period where low <b>volatility</b> is the norm, and not as a definitive end to the Great Moderation.|$|E

The relationships between the importance of nontradable goods (measured by the ratio of consumption expenditures on nontradables to expenditures on tradables) and the <b>volatilities</b> of aggregates are studied for a sub-sample of 23 countries.

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{leverage}} is {{also reflected in}} the pricing of options written on leveraged ETFs. In particular, the terminal payoff of a leveraged ETF European/American put or call depends on the realized variance (hence the path) of the underlying index. The impact of leverage ratio can also be observed from the implied <b>volatility</b> surfaces of leveraged ETF options. For instance, the implied <b>volatility</b> curves of inverse leveraged ETFs (with negative multipliers such as -1, -2, or -3) are commonly observed to be increasing in strike, which is characteristically different from the implied <b>volatility</b> smiles or skews seen for index options or non-leveraged ETF options.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{lead-lag}} relationship in daily returns and <b>volatilities</b> between price {{movements of the}} FTSE/ATHEX- 20 and FTSE/ATHEX Mid- 40 stock index futures and the underlying cash indices in the relatively new futures market of Greece. Empirical results {{show that there is}} a bi-directional relationship between cash and futures prices. However, futures lead the cash index returns, by responding more rapidly to economic events than stock prices. This speed is much higher in the more liquid FTSE/ATHEX- 20 market. Moreover, results indicate that futures <b>volatilities</b> spill information over to the corresponding cash market <b>volatilities</b> in both investigated futures markets, but <b>volatilities</b> in the cash markets have no effect on the <b>volatilities</b> of futures markets. Overall, it seems that new market information is disseminated faster in the futures market compared to the stock market. This implies that the futures markets can be used as price discovery vehicles, providing further evidence that derivatives markets contribute to completing and stabilising capital markets in Greece. A further finding {{of this study is that}} futures volume and disequilibrium effects between cash and futures prices are important variables in the explanation of <b>volatilities</b> in cash and futures markets.
