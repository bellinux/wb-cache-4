5|$|Both {{candidates}} received {{financial support}} from outside the district, some of which was used to buy votes or bribe <b>voters</b> <b>to</b> stay home. Breckinridge received several thousand dollars, with a substantial amount coming from Washington, D.C. banker William Wilson Corcoran; estimates of Letcher's support ranged from $30,000 to $100,000. Breckinridge won the canvass by 526 votes and received 71% {{of the vote in}} Owen County, which recorded 123 more votes than registered voters.|$|E

25|$|There {{are a few}} {{offences}} under election law. Most {{of these}} pertain to acts which induce a <b>voter</b> <b>to</b> cast his ballot for a candidate.

5000|$|The new {{election}} law adopted for the 1993 Duma election stipulated half the 450 Duma members were elected by a party-list system of proportional representation, and half were elected as individual representatives from single-member districts. Every Russian voter thus received two different ballots. The proportional representation ballot compelled each <b>voter</b> <b>to</b> endorse an electoral organization or vote against all of them. By contrast, the single-member district ballot required a <b>voter</b> <b>to</b> endorse an individual, whose party affiliation, if any, {{could not be}} given on the ballot.|$|R

5|$|On the {{weekends}} of 9–10 November 2013 and 8–9 February 2014 all voting stations were opened for new <b>voters</b> <b>to</b> register {{and for those}} who moved residence to re-register in their new voting district. The presidency of South Africa urged voters who had missed the voting station registration weekends to register at an IEC office during office hours. Presidential spokesperson, Mac Maharaj, said that voters were allowed to register to vote until the election date is published in a government gazette, after which the voters' roll is closed. Approximately 5.5 million people in total visited voting stations, including between 1 and 2 million new voters. This increased the number of registered <b>voters</b> <b>to</b> 25.3 million, representing 80.5% of the 31.4 million people eligible to vote in the country. South Africans who were born after the 1994 general election, known as the born-free generation, and are aged 18 or older were eligible to vote for the first time.|$|E
5|$|To {{expand his}} power, Napoleon used these {{assassination}} plots {{to justify the}} creation of an imperial system based on the Roman model. He believed that a Bourbon restoration would be more difficult if his family's succession was entrenched in the constitution. Launching yet another referendum, Napoleon was elected as Emperor of the French by a tally exceeding 99%. As with the Life Consulate two years earlier, this referendum produced heavy participation, bringing out almost 3.6 million <b>voters</b> <b>to</b> the polls.|$|E
5|$|A statewide {{referendum}} on the ballot that day continued the work begun by the new city charter in asking <b>voters</b> <b>to</b> consolidate {{the city and county}} governments in Philadelphia. In 1854, all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County had been consolidated into one city, but many county offices still existed, duplicating the efforts of city officials. The merger would also bring county offices under the civil service protections of the new city charter. Merging the city and county governments had been defeated in a 1937 referendum, but in 1951 the question was overwhelmingly approved. Two other ballot proposals authorized the city to borrow $17 million for municipal improvements and $14 million for the gas works; both passed by a five-to-one margin.|$|E

50|$|To ease this task, {{above the}} line voting allows the <b>voter</b> <b>to</b> choose one party or group, and all the {{remaining}} squares are deemed to be filled in according to a registered party ticket. About 95% of <b>voters</b> choose <b>to</b> use this method. This leads to pre-election trading between parties on how each party will allocate later preferences to other parties and candidates.|$|R
5|$|Although Desha was universally {{acknowledged}} {{as the leading}} candidate during {{the early months of}} the campaign, as election day approached, some began to doubt whether he could withstand the withering attacks of the Anti-Relief Party. The Frankfort Argus, a pro-Desha newspaper, remained confident, however, predicting that the Relief candidate would win by a margin of 4-to-1. On election day, Desha secured a comfortable victory, receiving 38,378 votes, nearly 60% of the votes cast, and carrying large majorities even in some strongly Anti-Relief counties. Tompkins garnered 22,499 votes, with his support concentrated mostly in Central Kentucky. Russell finished third with 3,900 votes. Desha and his allies in the General Assembly interpreted the victory as a mandate from the <b>voters</b> <b>to</b> aggressively pursue their debt relief agenda.|$|E
5|$|During the First Austrian Republic, pan-Germanists were {{represented}} by the Greater German People's Party and the agrarian Landbund. Although initially influential, these two groups soon lost most of their <b>voters</b> <b>to</b> the Christian Social Party and the Social Democratic Party. Both the Christian Socials and the Social Democrats accepted that unification between Austria and Germany was forbidden by the Treaty of Saint-Germain. A conflict would develop, however, between those who supported an Austrian national identity, such as the Christian Socials, and those rooted in German nationalism, such as the Social Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Gjems-Onstad's {{cooperation}} with Hagen was however not to last. In early 1976 Gjems-Onstad voiced his discontent with the ever-ongoing conflicts within the party, {{and he had}} by mid-year not decided {{whether or not he}} wanted to run for re-election. He eventually felt squeezed out of the party, and wanted no part in the intriguing he considered Hagen to represent. He was replaced as parliamentary leader of the party at the start of October. After he in turn recommended <b>voters</b> <b>to</b> rather vote for the Conservative Party in an interview with Aftenposten, he was finally expelled from the party by a unanimously approved motion put forward by Carl I. Hagen later the same month. Gjems-Onstad finished his term as an independent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Recently {{proposed}} end-to-end independently-verifiable (E 2 E) voting schemes provide encrypted paper receipts <b>to</b> <b>voters,</b> who may later {{check that}} these receipts {{are in the}} electronic ballot box. Unfortunately, few <b>voters</b> are likely <b>to</b> follow up on the voting process after leaving the voting site; as a result, few receipts will be checked. This paper describes an enhancement to E 2 E schemes that {{does not require the}} <b>voter</b> <b>to</b> perform a task outside the polling booth. It enables the <b>voter</b> <b>to</b> electronically transmit her receipt, from the polling booth, to a trusted external verifier. This is done {{through the use of a}} human-verifiable digital signature primitive whose (short-lived) security depends on the hardness of an AI problem. The primitive enables the <b>voter</b> <b>to</b> be certain—without access to trusted computational power in the voting booth—that the receipt has been securely deposited with the external verifier. The approach presents several advantages: the voter is not required to do anything outside the polling booth, no receipts are needed after polling, all receipts generated by the polling machine can be checked, and any classical digital signatures on receipts can be checked instantaneously by the trusted verifier. Additionally, an audio-based format is an easy extension for those with visual disabilities. The cost of these benefits is the introduction of the verifier, who needs to be trusted not to launch a denial-of-service attack...|$|R

5|$|In 2008 Clinton, a Senator and {{candidate}} for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, became the first American woman to win a presidential primary. Traister discusses Clinton's political campaign, which did not focus on her gender, and the misogynistic reactions she received from the media and political opponents. She argues that the Democratic Party's lack of response to the sexism of Clinton's opponents led {{a large number of}} liberal female <b>voters</b> <b>to</b> abandon the party, and blames Mark Penn for advising Clinton not to advertise herself as a feminist. Although she originally supported John Edwards' candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, she became a strong supporter of Clinton.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005 {{session of}} the General Assembly, Daniels and Republicans, with some Democratic support, {{successfully}} enacted a voter registration law that required <b>voters</b> <b>to</b> show a government issued photo ID before they could be permitted to vote. The law {{was the first of}} its kind in the United States, and many civil rights organizations, like the ACLU, opposed the bill saying it would unfairly impact minorities, poor, and elderly voters who may be unable to afford an ID or may be physically unable to apply for an ID. To partially address those concerns, the state passed another law authorizing state license branches to offer free state photo ID cards to individuals who did not already possess another type of state ID.|$|E
