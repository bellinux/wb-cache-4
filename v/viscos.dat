40|$|In many {{technical}} systems {{which are}} exposed to dynamic loading (oscillating excitation), it is required to reduce {{the reaction of the}} system Eigen dynamic due to durability, functionality or comfort. A widespread means of the Eigen dynamic reaction redaction is uncoupling/isolating the excitation source from the examined Eigen dynamic and damping of this reaction. For this purpose the elastomer (rubber) mounting is often used. The elastomer material shows a distinct elastic and less viscose behavior. For increasing of viscosity the elastomer is intermixed with, for example, carbon particulate matter. The system operation in <b>viscos</b> mode involves energy dissipation so that oscillation redaction is very efficient. An alternative to the rubber mounting with or without the additives is polymer mounting that exhibits in addition to elastic characteristic a distinctive <b>viscos</b> behavior. The polymer mounting is also convenient to isolating and damping of system oscillation exciting by environment or other technical systems in the neighborhood. Furthermore the viscoelastic material is the base of many smart materials. Thus smart materials mounting are often interest for active application. That is why we pursuit the investigation of mechanical properties of the viscoelastic material. We investigated viscoelastic behavior of polymer mounting at one degree of freedom oscillator in translating mode and estimated the frequency response of this dynamic system. Thereby, the stiffness-damping ratio is varied. We considered a numerical model of the one mass point oscillator with polymer mounting. Due to aperiodic damping behavior, we used to describe of this oscillator the fractional differential formulation. The fractional differential formulation is powerful to represent wide more dynamic behavior than the integer differential formulation. The amplitude and phase plot even depends on the derivative order of terms of the corresponding differential equation. In many cases the formulation by fractional differential equations is not pays off, because the accuracy achieved by ordinary differential equation is well enough. However in the cases of strong damping {{it seems to be a}} required way...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the investigation of the suitability of several empirical and semi-empirical drying models available in the literature to define drying behavior of viscose yarn bobbins. For this purpose, firstly, experimental drying behaviour of viscose bobbins was determined on an experimental dryer setup which was designed and manufactured based on hot-air bobbin dryers used in textile industry. Afterwards, drying models considered were fitted to the experimentally obtained moisture ratios. Drying parameters were drying temperature and bobbin diameter. The fit was performed by selecting the values for constants in the models {{in such a way that}} these values make the sum of the squared differences between the experimental and the model results for moisture ratio minimum. Suitability of fitting was specified as comparing the correlation coefficient, standard error and mean square deviation. The results show that the most appropriate model in describing the drying curves of viscose bobbins is the Page model. Keywords—Drying, moisture ratio, Page model, <b>viscos...</b>|$|E

40|$|Several design methods {{aimed at}} sizing the viscous dampers to be {{inserted}} in building structures {{have been proposed}} in the last decades. Among others, the authors proposed a five-step procedure which guides the practical design from {{the choice of a}} target reduction in the seismic response of the structural system (with respect to the response of a structure without any additional damping devices), to the identification of the corresponding damping ratio and the mechanical characteristics of the commercially available viscous dampers. The procedure requires the development of numerical simulations for the evaluations of the peak inter-storey velocity profiles, necessary for the evaluation of the non-linear damping coefficient. In the present paper analytical formulations for the maximum inter-storey velocity are used in order to update the original five-step procedure leading to a direct (i. e. fully analytical) procedure.

In this paper, the seismic response of two adjacent single storey buildings of different fundamental frequencies connected with {{various types of}} dampers under different earthquake excitations is studied. A formulation of the equations of motion for model of buildings connected with dampers is presented. The seismic response {{of the system is}} obtained by numerically solving the equations of motion using state-space method. The effectiveness of various types of dampers, viz., non-linear <b>viscos</b> and viscoelastic dampers in terms of the reduction of structural responses (i. e., displacements and accelerations) of connected adjacent buildings is investigated. A parametric study is also conducted to investigate the optimum damping coefficient of the dampers for adjacent single storey connected buildings. Results show that connecting {{the adjacent}} single storey buildings of different fundamental frequencies by these dampers can effectively reduce the earthquake induced responses of either building. There exist optimum damper coefficients for minimum earthquake response of the buildings. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: So far, a {{few studies}} have tried to {{investigate}} the relationship between the placement of fixed orthodontic appliances and the change of nonmicrobial salivary properties, mostly with conflicting outcomes and short-term assessment (up to 6 months from bracket placement). The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the salivary flow rate, pH and buffer capacity prior to the beginning of therapy and after 1 year from bracket placement using a simple and commercially available chairside saliva check kit. Methods: The study population consisted of 20 healthy patients (mean age, 16. 5 ± 4 years) scheduled for fixed orthodontic treatment. Salivary samples were taken just before bracket bonding (T 0; baseline assessment) and after 1 year of treatment (T 1; half-treatment assessment) using the GC Saliva-Check Kit (GC Corp., Leuven, Belgium). Results: No statistically significant difference was detected between T 0 and T 1 for the salivary parameters examined in the present study. Conclusions: Under the conditions of this study, the placement of fixed orthodontic appliances did not change the salivary pH, buffer capacity and flow rate after 1 year of treatment if compared with the baseline assessment.

40|$|Epithelial {{organs are}} almost universally secretory. The lung secretes mucus of {{extremely}} variable consistency. In the early prenatal period, the secretions are of largely unknown composition, consistency, and flow rates. In addition to net outflow from secretion, the embryonic lung exhibits transient reversing flows from peristalsis. Airway peristalsis (AP) begins {{as soon as}} the smooth muscle forms, and persists until birth. Since the prenatal lung is liquid-filled, smooth muscle action can transport fluid far from the immediately adjacent tissues. The sensation of internal fluid flows has been shown to have potent morphogenetic effects, as has the transport of morphogens. We hypothesize that these effects {{play an important role in}} lung morphogenesis. To test these hypotheses in a quantitative framework, we analyzed the fluid-structure interactions between embryonic tissues and lumen fluid resulting from peristaltic waves that partially occlude the airway. We found that if the airway is closed, fluid transport is minimal; by contrast, if the trachea is open, shear rates can be very high, particularly at the stenosis.

It has been proved that potato cultivars with field resistance (Lugovskoy) provide a protection level comparable to the effectiveness of modern fungicides. Plant extracts from Southern plants can be used as biopesticides in order to additionally suppress the development of late blight. For example, extracts of four species from Yemen (fam. Asteraceae: Psiadia arabica Jaup and Spach; fam. Lamiaceae: Lawsonia inermis L; Dodonea <b>viscos</b> L; Euryops arabicus Steud. ex Jaub and Spach) were capable of suppressing late blight development on potato.
