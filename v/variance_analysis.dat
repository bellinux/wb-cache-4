50|$|<b>Variance</b> <b>analysis</b> is a {{systematic}} {{approach to the}} comparison of the actual and budgeted costs of the raw materials and labour used during a production period. While some form of <b>variance</b> <b>analysis</b> is still used by most manufacturing firms, it nowadays tends {{to be used in}} conjunction with innovative techniques such as life cycle cost analysis and activity-based costing, which are designed with specific aspects of the modern business environment in mind. Life-cycle costing recognizes that managers' ability to influence the cost of manufacturing a product is at its greatest when the product is still at the design stage of its product life-cycle (i.e., before the design has been finalized and production commenced), since small changes to the product design may lead to significant savings in the cost of manufacturing the products.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} part of standard cost accounting is a <b>variance</b> <b>analysis,</b> which breaks down the variation between actual cost and standard costs into various components (volume variation, material cost variation, labor cost variation, etc.) so managers can understand why costs were different from what was planned and take appropriate action to correct the situation.|$|E

50|$|In <b>variance</b> <b>analysis,</b> direct {{material}} usage (efficiency, quantity) variance {{is the difference}} between the standard quantity of materials that should have been used for the number of units actually produced, and the actual quantity of materials used, valued at the standard cost per unit of material.

50|$|<b>Variance</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is usually}} {{associated}} with explaining the difference (or variance) between actual costs and the standard costs allowed for the good output.

The difference between the actual direct labor costs and the standard direct labor costs can be divided into a rate variance and an efficiency variance. The difference in manufacturing overhead can be divided into spending, efficiency, and volume variances. Mix and yield variances can also be calculated.|$|E
