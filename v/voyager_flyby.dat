Nevertheless, there are differences between the clouds of each hemisphere. The northern clouds are smaller, sharper and brighter. They appear to lie at a higher altitude, which is connected to fact that until 2004 (see below) no southern polar cloud had been observed at the wavelength 2.2micrometres, which is sensitive to the methane absorption, whereas northern clouds have been regularly observed in this wavelength band. The lifetime of clouds spans several orders of magnitude.

Somewhat contaminated water ice makes up the vast expanse of Saturn's rings. Modified methane ice may comprise Uranus' rings while silicates are the likely material of the Jovian ring. Saturn's rings form an elaborate system whose characteristics are still being documented and whose nature is being unravelled following the <b>Voyager</b> <b>flybys.</b> Uranus' nine narrow bands display an intriguing dynamical structure thought to be caused by unseen shephard satellites.

5000|$|In 1986, Voyager 2 {{found that}} the visible {{southern}} hemisphere of Uranus can be subdivided into two regions: a bright polar cap and dark equatorial bands. Their boundary is located at about −45° of latitude. A narrow band straddling the latitudinal range from −45 to −50° is the brightest large feature on its visible surface. It is called a southern [...] "collar". The cap and collar {{are thought to be}} a dense region of methane clouds located within the pressure range of 1.3 to 2 bar (see above). Besides the large-scale banded structure, Voyager 2 observed ten small bright clouds, most lying several degrees to the north from the collar. In all other respects Uranus looked like a dynamically dead planet in 1986. Voyager 2 arrived during the height of Uranus's southern summer and could not observe the northern hemisphere. At the beginning of the 21st century, when the northern polar region came into view, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Keck telescope initially observed neither a collar nor a polar cap in the northern hemisphere. So Uranus appeared to be asymmetric: bright near the south pole and uniformly dark in the region north of the southern collar. In 2007, when Uranus passed its equinox, the southern collar almost disappeared, and a faint northern collar emerged near 45° of latitude.In the 1990s, the number of the observed bright cloud features grew considerably partly because new high-resolution imaging techniques became available. Most were found in the northern hemisphere as it started to become visible. An early explanation—that bright clouds are easier to identify in its dark part, whereas in the southern hemisphere the bright collar masks them - was shown to be incorrect. Nevertheless there are differences between the clouds of each hemisphere. The northern clouds are smaller, sharper and brighter. They appear to lie at a higher altitude. The lifetime of clouds spans several orders of magnitude. Some small clouds live for hours; at least one southern cloud may have persisted since the <b>Voyager</b> <b>flyby.</b> Recent observation also discovered that cloud features on Uranus {{have a lot in common}} with those on Neptune. For example, the dark spots common on Neptune had never been observed on Uranus before 2006, when the first such feature dubbed Uranus Dark Spot was imaged. The speculation is that Uranus is becoming more Neptune-like during its equinoctial season.|$|E

40|$|Photographic imagery from Pioneer and <b>Voyager</b> <b>flyby</b> {{satellites}} {{has been}} used to study the microphysical properties of Saturn's outermost E-ring, and to determine the physical relationship between the E-ring and the satellite Enceladus.

It is suggested that the E-ring is continuously replenished by volcanic eruptions on Enceladus, and recent tectonic evidence is cited in support of this hypothesis.

40|$|Nitrogen and methane ices on {{the surface}} of Triton, Neptune's largest satellite, are {{exchanged}} between the summer and winter hemispheres on a seasonal time scale. Images of the satellite's sky obtained by the Voyager 2 spacecraft show the presence of several types of scattering materials that provide insights into this seasonal cycle of volatiles. Discrete clouds, probably composed of N 2 ice particles, arise in regions of active sublimation. They are found chiefly poloward of 30 deg S in the southern, summer hemisphere. Haze particles, probably made of hydrocarbon ices, are present above most, but not all places. Recent snowfall may have occurred at low southern latitudes in places where they are absent. The latent heat released {{in the formation of the}} discrete clouds may have a major impact on the thermal balance of the lower atmosphere.

40|$|The {{observations}} of the Jovian aurora made by the Voyager UV spectrometer (UVS) during 1979 are analyzed, with special consideration given to the model fitting process. Several different estimates of the function specifying auroral arc geometry were tried, with the Broadfoot et al. (1981) estimate, found by probing {{with the tip of}} the UVS slit, giving the best agreement; this agreement is slightly better than the agreement with the Io torus footprint computed by Roederer et al. (1977). The results suggest that the UVS observations are more sensitive to the surface field geometry than are the <b>Voyager</b> <b>flyby</b> in situ observations. The results of a study of intensity maximum positions indicate that the particles exciting the spatially variable portion of the aurora are drifting west, implying either that these particles are electrons or that they are positive ions drifting east more slowly than the corotation lag of the Io torus region carries them to the west. The latter case is most consistent with the high-energy charged particle measurements...|$|E

SystemIII refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet in the period of the <b>Voyager</b> <b>flybys,</b> it has been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 39min 22.4sec (810.8°/d).

40|$|<b>Voyager's</b> <b>flyby</b> of Neptune in August of 1989 was {{the most}} distant {{planetary}} encounter ever achieved.

Consequently, the majority of radiometric tracking was accomplished by transmitting the uplink from one station, and receiving the downlink at a different station. This procedure defines three-way data. Dependence on three-way data for orbit determination is one distinguishing element of Voyager's successful encounter with Neptune.

Also, calibrations which reduce systematic errors inherent to three-way data are described and analyzed...|$|R
40|$|The recent <b>Voyager</b> <b>flyby</b> of Titan {{produced}} {{evidence for}} at least nine organic compounds in that atmosphere that are heavier than methane. Several models of Titan's atmosphere, as well as laboratory simulations, suggest the presence of organics considerably more complex that those observed. To ensure that the in situ measurements are definitive with respect to Titan's atmosphere, experiment concepts, and the related instrumentation, must be carefully developed specifically for such a mission. To this end, the possible composition of the environment to be analyzed must be bracketed and model samples must be provided for instrumentation development studies. Laboratory studies to define the optimum flight experiment and sampling strategy for a Titan entry probe are currently being conducted. Titan mixtures are being subjected {{to a variety of}} energy sources including high voltage electron from a DC discharge, high current electric shock, and laser detonation. Gaseous and solid products are produced which are then analyzed. Samples from these experiements are also provided to candidate flight experiments as models for instrument development studies.

40|$|Introduction: The Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) {{aboard the}} Cassini orbiter has {{obtained}} {{the first in}} situ composition measurements of the neutral densities of molecular nitrogen, methane, argon, {{and a host of}} stable carbon-nitrile compounds in its first flyby of Titan. The bulk composition and thermal structure of the moon s upper atmosphere {{do not appear to be}} changed since the <b>Voyager</b> <b>flyby</b> in 1979. However, the more sensitive techniques provided by modern in-situ mass spectrometry also give evidence for large-spatial-scale large-amplitude atmospheric waves in the upper atmosphere and for a plethora of stable carbon-nitrile compounds above 1174 km. Furthermore, they allow the first direct measurements of isotopes of nitrogen, carbon, and argon, which provide interesting clues about the evolution of the atmosphere. The atmosphere was first accreted as ammonia and ammonia ices from the Saturn sub-nebula. Subsequent photochemistry likely converted the atmosphere into molecular nitrogen. The early atmosphere was 1. 5 to 5 times more substantial and was lost via escape over the intervening 4. 5 billion years due to the reduced gravity associated with the relatively small mass of Titan. Carbon in the form of methane has continued to outgas over time from the interior with much of it being deposited in the form of complex hydrocarbons on the surface and some of it also being lost to space...|$|E
40|$|Several recent {{papers have}} {{reviewed}} the upper atmospheres and ionospheres of Jupiter and Saturn {{in the post}} Voyager era (see, e. g., / 1 / and references therein). Therefore, this paper will review only the most salient characteristics, as far as Jupiter and Saturn are concerned. The emphasis here, however, {{is placed on the}} Uranus upper atmosphere that was probed in January, 1986, by Voyager 2 spacecraft. In particular comparative aspects of atmospheric composition, thermal structure, photochemistry and the vertical mixing are discussed. For all practical purposes, the bulk compositions of the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn are reflective of the solar ratios of the elements. The mixing ratios of atmospheric constituents on Jupiter are shown in Figure 1. Due to the relatively low tropospheric temperatures on Jupiter, H 20, H 2 S and NH 3 would condense at the 2 - 5, 1. 5 - 2. 5 and 0. 7 - 0. 4 bar pressure levels respectively. Similar condensation is expected for Saturn. On Uranus, condensation of CH 4 at —~ 1300 mb, and formation of an aqueous-ammonia solution cloud and an H 2 S-ice cloud are also expected. Despite the recent <b>Voyager</b> <b>flyby</b> of Uranus, the inventory of detected species on this planet remains unaltered. Unlike Jupiter and Saturn, there are only a handful of constituents that have been detected on Uranus, as is evident from Table 1. Noteworthy in this table are NH 3, CH 4 and H. The depletion of NH 3 relative to the value corresponding to the solar N/H ratio (8. 7 x 10 -s) is most likely due to the removal of 75 t...|$|E
