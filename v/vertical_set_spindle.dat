40|$|SummaryJust as {{the size}} of an {{organism}} is carefully controlled, {{the size of}} intracellular structures must also be regulated. The mitotic spindle is a supramolecular machine that generates the forces which separate sister chromatids during mitosis [1]. Although spindles show little size variation between cells of the same type, spindle length can vary at least 10 -fold between different species [2]. Recent experiments on spindle length showed that in embryonic systems spindle length varied with blastomere size [3]. Furthermore, a comparison between two Xenopus species showed that spindle length was dependent on some cytoplasmic factor [4]. These data point toward mechanisms to scale spindle length with cell size. Centrosomes {{play an important role in}} organizing microtubules during spindle assembly [5]. Here we use Caenorhabditis elegans to study the role of centrosomes in <b>setting</b> <b>spindle</b> length. We show that spindle length correlates with centrosome size through development and that a reduction of centrosome size by molecular perturbation reduces spindle length. By systematically analyzing centrosome proteins, we show that spindle length does not depend on microtubule density at centrosomes. Rather, our data suggest that centrosome size <b>sets</b> mitotic <b>spindle</b> length by controlling the length scale of a TPXL- 1 gradient along spindle microtubules...|$|R

40|$|To {{assemble}} mitotic spindles, cells nucleate microtubules from {{a variety}} of sources including chromosomes and centrosomes. We know little about how the regulation of microtubule nucleation contributes to spindle bipolarity and spindle size. The Aurora A kinase activator TPX 2 is required for microtubule nucleation from chromosomes as well as for spindle bipolarity. We use bacterial artificial chromosome–based recombineering to introduce point mutants that block the interaction between TPX 2 and Aurora A into human cells. TPX 2 mutants have very short spindles but, surprisingly, are still bipolar and segregate chromosomes. Examination of microtubule nucleation during spindle assembly shows that microtubules fail to nucleate from chromosomes. Thus, chromosome nucleation is not essential for bipolarity during human cell mitosis when centrosomes are present. Rather, chromosome nucleation is involved in spindle pole separation and <b>setting</b> <b>spindle</b> length. A second Aurora A–independent function of TPX 2 is required to bipolarize spindles...|$|R

Two-nodal culm cuttings from the basal and middle parts in Oxytenanthera abyssinica under horizontal setting gave high survival rate (Gebrehiwot et al. 2016). High survival rates with horizontal setting {{may be due to}} increase of surface area which is responsible for high water uptake from the surrounding medium (Stapleton 1985). Higher sprouting with horizontal setting was also reported by Chhetri and Kumar (2015) and Elbasheer and Raddad (2013) respectively for B. ventricosa and Oxytenanthera abyssinica.|$|R

Line detection on scanned forms is often accomplished with the Hough transform. Here it is fol-lowed by simultaneous extraction of the dominant perpendicular sets of extract-ed lines, which ensures rotation invariance. Translation and scale invariance are attained by using minimal horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>sets</b> of distance ratios (“rule gap ratios”) instead of rule-edge locations. The ratios are logarithmically mapped to an alphabet so that the resulting symbol strings can be classified by. edit distance. Some probability distributions associated with these steps are de-rived.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} the <b>vertical</b> <b>set</b> square distance (VSSD) technique {{that is designed}} to efficiently and scalably measure the total variation of a set about a fixed point in large datasets. The set can be any projected subspace of any vector space, including oblique subspaces (not just dimensional subspaces). VSSD can determine the closeness of a point to a set of points in a dataset, which can be very useful for classification, clustering and outlier detection tasks. The technique employs a vertical data structure called the Predicate-tree (P-tree) 1. Performance evaluations based on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that VSSD technology is fast, accurate and scales well to very large datasets, as compared to similar techniques utilizing horizontal record-based data structure...|$|R

In the first experiment 1. 320 bovine oocytes were suspended in 1. 4 M glycerol in Phosphate buffered saline (PBS), {{and in the}} second one 206 bovine oocytes were suspended in 1. 4 M glycerol and 0. 3 M sucrose in PBS. After the equilibration in 1. 4 M glycerol in PBS for 10 minutes, each plastic straw filled with the bovine oocyte was kept deep directly in an alcohol bath at - 6 ℃ at the vertical or horizontal settings for 10 minutes. Thereafter, The straws were gradually cooled to - 30 ℃ at a cooling rate of 0. 3 ℃/min before stored in liquid nitrogen. To evaluate the morphological deformations incurred during the above manipulations each sample of frozen oocytes was thawed just before microscopic examinations at 100 - 200 fold magnification. Lost rates of oocytes frozen at the vertical and horizontal settins were 2 % (13 / 628) and 0. 4 % (3 / 692) respectively. When straws were frozen at the <b>vertical</b> <b>setting,</b> the incidence of deformed zonae pellucida and cell was 31. 1 % (191 / 615) and 18 % (111 / 615), and those were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than 22. 8 % (157 / 689) and 10 % (69 / 689) obtained with the straws frozen at the horizontal setting.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the extent of vertical flexibility and the underlying financial choices of a firm.

An alternative to debt is the involvement of venture capital for the production of the input. We explore this second avenue finding that the extent of outsourcing adopted is lower than for the unlevered firm, but the firm invests earlier...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Plants are the {{intervention}} between buildings and climate since they can benefit buildings by modifying the micro-climate. The foliage density of plants, or more accurately the Leaf Area Index (LAI), {{is the key}} to govern the magnitude of such intervention at the micro-level.

Also, we give a simple explicit condition which, when satisfied, implies that the <b>vertical</b> rotation <b>set</b> contains an interval and thus also implies positive topological entropy. As a corollary of the above results, we prove a version of Boyland's conjecture to this setting: If f is area preserving and has a lift f̂ to the cylinder with zero Lebesgue measure vertical rotation number, then either the orbits of all points are uniformly bounded under f̂, or there are points in the cylinder with positive vertical velocity and others with negative vertical velocity...|$|R
