[...] With a 40% open area, the screen wall sits three {{feet in front of}} an expansive glazed curtain wall and provides shading of the upper level reading room while allowing natural daylight to enter the space. [...] The shading system allows a reduced dependence on artificial lighting and protects the Library’s collection from harmful solar exposure. To take full advantage of the location's potential for unobstructed natural light, clerestory windows and translucent, insulated fiberglass panels on the north provide illumination from the sun on all sides. Lighting design firm MCLA validated light levels in the large, open room through a detailed analysis. The lighting designers developed an electric lighting system based primarily on the T5 linear fluorescent with a 3500-Kelvin color temperature—the lamp preferred by the client for energy and maintenance efficiency.

30|$|Referring to Table  4, {{values for}} <b>vertical</b> <b>illumination</b> were higher for side {{location}} point than the corresponding center location point. This was mainly {{due to the}} geometric relationship between the location points {{and the source of}} light - the ambient light, surround light and reflected light off the task surface. There were two factors to consider: first, the difference in distances from the light sources; second and the more importantly, the amount of light, E(+x) seen at the point locations. The first factor favored the center location point but the second favored the side location points. This was because center location point {{was in the middle of}} the table and only half of the light that was in front of the location point contributed to its <b>vertical</b> <b>illumination.</b> As can be seen from Table  3, all the values of <b>Vertical</b> <b>Illumination</b> and Contrast Ratios for center location points were less than that of the side location points.

Uni-Travelling Carrier (UTC) photodiodes are very prospective candidates for reaching this objective, but so far only have been reported as lumped-elements or as edge-illuminated optical-waveguide travelling-wave (TW) devices. To overcome the associated power limitations of those implementations, we are developing a novel implementation of the UTC photodiodes which combines a traveling-wave photomixer with <b>vertical</b> velocity-matched <b>illumination</b> in a distributed structure.

30|$|Illumination is a main {{factor that}} affects the {{appearance}} of an image [35]. The lighting from different directions may cause the uneven illuminations, which often lead to intensity heterogeneity. Therefore, illumination equalization {{plays a significant role}} in image analysis and processing [36]. Liew et al. [35] has introduced an effective way to reduce the impacts of <b>vertical</b> direction uneven <b>illumination.</b> This method just processes the single point on the boundary and its effect may be influenced by image noise. In this paper, we adopt an improved illumination equalization method proposed in [35] via the analysis of local region along the image boundary, which is more robust against noise and adaptive to the multifarious illumination directions. This method consists of two illumination directions, the horizontal direction and the vertical direction. The uneven illumination can be regarded as the liner along its direction.|$|R

We investigated this recommendation by creating two very different lighting conditions in two workstations in a mock-up open-plan office space. One workstation was provided with conventional, dimmable ceiling-recessed parabolic fixtures. The other, adjacent, workstation featured an innovative, dimmable, "partition washer" system designed to preferentially light the vertical surfaces in the occupant's field of view; this was supplemented by a fixed 150 lx on the desktop from overhead. Participants (lighting experts) were assigned to one of the workstations and spent around 7 minutes reading and evaluating an on-screen article and a summary of the article, and completing an on-screen questionnaire on satisfaction with the lighting. This was done under one of four fixed initial lighting conditions. The participants then set the lighting to their own preference using on-screen dimmers, and repeated the task and questionnaire. Participants then switched workstations and repeated the procedure under the other lighting condition. Results showed that {{there was no significant difference}} in satisfaction between lighting conditions, although the partition washer condition required significantly less power. Participants were more satisfied with the lighting after control independent of lighting conditions, as expected. Further, derivation of preferred surface illuminances suggests that supplementary partition illuminance, beyond that which is provided by ceiling-recessed parabolics, is desirable...|$|R

40|$|Un modèle décrivant la température d'équilibre des lagunes a été développé, tenant compte des différents flux de chaleur que celles-ci échangent avec l'air et le sol environnant. Six {{composantes}} différentes ont été inclues dans le calcul de ce bilan thermique: radiation solaire, évaporation, convection, rayonnement atmosphérique, rayonnement de la surface du plan d'eau, échange via les parois en contact avec le sol. Le modèle ainsi obtenu a été testé avec efficacité sur deux lagunes aérées et une lagune naturelle situées sous climat tempéré; sa précision sur l'estimation des températures d'équilibre étant de l'ordre de 0. 7 °C. Des simulations en continu ont également pu être effectuées au moyen d'une variante dynamique, tenant compte de l'inertie thermique qu'entraîne {{le volume}} des bassins. Quelle que soit la saison envisagée, la principale forme d'apport de chaleur est représentée par la radiation solaire tandis que la dissipation d'énergie se partage entre les flux d'évaporation et la balance des deux flux de rayonnement. Les bassins échangeraient en moyenne plus de 250 W/m 2; le maximum de transfert de chaleur correspondant au printemps et à la période estivale. Enfin, l'analyse de sensibilité du modèle nous a permis de mettre en évidence la contribution de chacun des termes intervenant dans le calcul de ce bilan thermique et de révéler sa dépendance vis-à-vis principalement de la température d'entrée, du rayonnement solaire et de la température de l'air. Very {{few studies have}} ever focused on the thermal balance of a wastewater treatment process, despite its major impact on various aspects of sanitary engineering, such as biological growth, oxygen transfer and, most importantly, purification kinetics. This lack of knowledge is particularly worrying {{for the design of}} aerated lagoons and waste stabilization ponds, since these two extensive treatment technologies are extremely dependent on climatic conditions and subject to high thermal variations. In temperate regions, a pond annual temperature range can even exceed 20 °C, while a 10 °C variation will induce a more than 60 % drop or increase in its removal yield. Our paper intends to present a comprehensive temperature prediction model which accounts for the main heat loss and gain terms exchanged through the pond surface and walls. Our approach includes six different energy inputs and outputs, namely: solar radiation, air-water surface convection, atmospheric radiation, back surface radiation, evaporation and ground-water-walls convection. Each of these components was described extensively by means of a literature review of all previous efforts made to predict equilibrium temperature in lakes, rivers, salt-gradient solar ponds, cooling tanks, even outdoor pools. The best aspects of each prediction model were then incorporated into a new computer model developed as two different but complementary variants: one for steady-state conditions and the other for continuous and therefore also transient simulations. The main difference between these two approaches is that the first one neglects enthalpy variation while the second one {{takes the form of a}} differential equation, with basin temperatures being estimated by an iterative calculation procedure and a numerical integration method, respectively. Two hypotheses were necessary to develop this model. The first one posits that pond hydrodynamics correspond to completely mixed conditions. Such hydraulic behavior is extremely frequent in aerated lagoons and waste stabilization ponds in temperate climates, but less so in tropical or Mediterranean regions, where thermal balances appear much more complex since stabilization ponds are often thermally stratified. The second hypothesis is that all radiation fluxes received by the ponds are completely absorbed by the pond's contents and are never reflected, even partially, by their bottoms or walls. This model, which is in fact the thermal balance of the basins, relies mainly on meteorological factors and pond characteristics. Only two out of the six estimated fluxes - evaporation rates and solar radiation - are measured directly in situ. It seemed too difficult to estimate them, since predictive equations found in literature constantly gave unsatisfactory results. To establish the validity of this model, experimental data were collected at a wastewater treatment plant located in the southern part of Belgium. This plant consists of a series of two aerated lagoons and four waste stabilization ponds, designed for a nominal capacity of 7, 500 inhabitant-equivalents. Five rounds of measurements, each lasting from five to twenty days, were conducted at different periods of the year. Meteorological factors were continuously monitored by a data acquisition unit while the pond water temperatures and hydraulic flows were measured hourly. Evaporation rates were determined daily with several floating evaporation pans set at the pond surfaces. <b>Vertical</b> temperature and <b>illumination</b> profiles were also measured in order to verify the strict applicability of the two previous hypotheses. Ninety-three experimental data sets were collected on this particular facility. Predicted temperatures were compared with measured temperatures as well as with the results of three other models previously developed for waste stabilization ponds. Our new model systematically proved more reliable and accurate than previous approaches, since equilibrium temperatures were predicted with a mean absolute error of only 0. 7 °C. More than 52 % of the deviations between calculated and observed temperatures were even below 0. 5 °C, which indicates their relatively low dispersion. Continuous simulations were also conducted during a one-day period to demonstrate the importance of the ponds' large thermal capacities. The steady-state approach, which does not account for this latter phenomenon, failed to give consistent results, unlike our dynamic heat balance approach, which yielded extremely good fits with experimental data. A sensitivity analysis allowed us to show the influence of the various meteorological factors on the basins' equilibrium temperatures. In decreasing order, the fits seemed particularly sensitive to inlet temperature, solar radiation, air temperature and evaporation. Surprisingly, wind speed made only a small contribution to the total heat balance. However, this must be seen as a direct consequence of the fact that in our model this latter parameter is no longer used to calculate the predominant evaporation rates but only to estimate the much smaller convection term. Whatever the season considered, more than 90 % of the ponds' energy inputs come from solar radiation while the dominating loss mechanisms are represented by the balance of the two infrared radiation fluxes (46 %) and evaporation (42 %). The sign of the air-water convection term varies according to the period of the year but never accounts for more than 10 % of the total heat balance. Heat losses or gains from basin walls always remain insignificant and could therefore easily be neglected in order to simplify our approach to basin equilibrium temperatures...|$|R

This thesis demonstrates the first CMOS process compatible high-responsivity Ge p-i-n diodes for 1. 55 [mu]m wavelengths. The thermal expansion mismatch between Ge epilayers and Si substrates was used to engineer tensile strain upon cooling from the growth temperature. This 0. 2 % tensile strain results in a lowering of the direct transition energy in Ge by 30 meV and extends the responsivity curve to near 1. 6 [mu]m. Design rules are given for high speed and high responsivity, and the advantages of waveguide integration for simultaneous achievement of high speed and high responsivity are illustrated.

The purpose of this {{communication}} is to describe a simple apparatus for viewing and marking {{the cutting edge}} of the glass knives which are used in seetioning for electron microscopy (1, 2). The apparatus consists of a monocular microscope with base, arm, body tube, coarse and fine adjustments, an annular incident light objective lens, and a mechanical stage that has been modified to hold a glass knife. The apparatus is illustrated in Text-fig. 1.

40|$|Reflection {{contrast}} microscope {{methods are}} generally used for studies of those {{portions of the}} cell that are turned towards the glass coverslip, to comprehend {{the structure of the}} cytoskeleton and the dynamics of cell movement, as well as formation of cell-glass contacts. In incident illumination only reflected light contributes to picture formation. The intensity of which in the case of observation of unstained cells is small because of small refraction differences. To overcome this problem a reflection contrast system was developed by Leitz according to Ploem [49], in which by using contrast preserving measures the reflection becomes prominent in comparison with the lens reflexes. The emerging pictures are a result of interferences of reflections at glass-cell, cell-culture medium and culture medium-cell interfaces. According to Fresnel's equations the reflected intensity depends on the differences of the particular refractive indices and the thickness of the layers, which determine the phase of interfering beams. In idealized systems of thin films the reflected intensity is a measure for their optical constants. Relative reflection measurements from glass-cell areas is comparison with the known glass-medium reflection, can therefore be revealing as far as refraction index, cell-glass distance or cell thickness are concerned. The estimates by Bereiter-Hahn et al. [15] were made in the assumption of <b>vertical</b> <b>illumination</b> neglecting its actual conical shape: the comparison of two Fresnel functions of cytological relevant measurements show - in accordance with Gingell and Todd [24] - that this is only permitted under certain conditions, depending on the required accuracy of the measurements; an incidence angle of about 30 degrees leads to an error of about 10 %, an angle of 50 degrees to more than 50 %...|$|E

Using a parallel plate flow chamber with a stainless steel bottom plate and a glass top plate, adhesion was measured in situ on the bottom plate under moderate flow (15 s(- 1)) in an adhesion buffer with various amounts of CaCl 2 added.

The most common combination of reasons for reassurance were perceived access to help, lighting and spatial features. The presence of threatening others was added to this combination in areas participants found unreassuring. An image study demonstrated the resounding effect of lighting and {{drew attention to the}} possible simplification of the issue of reassurance in an experiment with tightly controlled variables. Therefore Study 2 took participants into real environments to see what matters there. Study 2 - Residential Street Surveys, took 77 participants to 9 residential streets in Sheffield and asked them to rate their perception of safety among other factors such as the presence of hiding places and perceived access to help. Photometric measurements revealed that the pattern of light expressed in the length and level of areas of low luminance matters to reassurance, as does <b>vertical</b> <b>illumination</b> and the lit appearance of the whole surroundings, not just the path ahead. It was found that low uniformity is acceptable in some circumstances. However street lighting cannot always be presented as {{a solution to the problem}} of the fall of darkness as it had less of an effect in environments with low perceived access to help and who else is on the street matters to reassurance regardless of lighting. An effect of seasonal variation in lighting conditions was also found. To summarise, Study 1 found that people think lighting matters, and Study 2 reaffirmed that it does, indicating possible minimum acceptable lighting conditions, which may be different to good practice. Further research is necessary to further explore the circumstances in which these minimum acceptable conditions apply and to define good lighting practice...|$|E
40|$|The {{origin of}} the grooves of Phobos has been debated since they were first discovered. Early {{hypotheses}} included faults or outgassing vents caused by tidal or drag forces during the capture of Phobos, but more recently, origins associated {{with the impact of}} Stickney, at 10 km the largest crater on Phobos, have predominated. The latter have envisaged the grooves as chains of secondary craters or fracturing associated with the Stickney impact. More recently, {{it has been suggested that}} they result from chains of secondary craters from large impacts on Mars. This last hypothesis predicts that the leading apex of Phobos should have families of parallel grooves crossing each other at all angles, but deciding between these various hypotheses has been hampered by the fact that not all of Phobos has been imaged by previous missions with sufficient resolution and illumination to detect the grooves. Phobos has now been imaged during more than a dozen passes by HRSC, including one of the unknown part of the northern hemisphere at 7 m resolution. There are also two images which include the leading apex at 48 m and 50 m resolution. Despite unfavourable <b>vertical</b> <b>illumination,</b> it can be seen to be heavily grooved, with orientations corresponding closely to those predicted by the last idea. A new map of Phobos’ grooves shows their orientation to be quite independent of Stickney crater, and the evidence is now overwhelming that the grooves of Phobos were caused by debris ejected from a large impact craters on Mars. The orientation of each family of grooves allows the inertial direction of arrival of the ejecta at Phobos to be determined, but not its velocity. By varying the velocity, we are able to determine the possible orbits that come from Mars’ surface, and a range of launch angles. Since launch angles of ejecta from hypervelocity impacts are now reasonably well understood, the latitude of the impact event on Mars that gave rise to each groove family can be calculated with a reasonable degree of confidence...|$|E
40|$|During {{the years}} 1955 - 1957 {{ecological}} {{data were collected}} in various types of mesophytic forest occurring in the northern half of central Suriname (fig. 1). Physiognomically as well as floristically these forests correspond {{with the type of}} vegetation which in the other parts of tropical America generally is designed as the “rain forest formation”. The main points of investigation were: (1) the environmental factors prevailing in mesophytic forest, more particularly in connection with the regeneration of tree species; (2) the variation in the floristic composition of some stands belonging to this formation; (3) the mode of regeneration of a number of valuable timber species under natural and artificial conditions. The first chapter deals with the general climate in northern Suriname, which is primarily determined by the distribution of the rainfall. Although (except for a narrow drought belt along the coast) the amount of total yearly reainfall is rather high (fig. 10), the distribution of precipitation is distinctly seasonal (figs. 4 - 9). The annual march of atmospheric humidity, air temperature and daily amount of sunshine are strongly correlated with that of the rainfall (figs. 4 and 31). Consequently, for a number of tree species flowering, growth and leaf fall also show a distinct periodicity. From an ecological point of view especially the length and the severity of the yearly period(s) of drought are of importance. To that effect the rainfall data obtained from the meteorological stations were worked up according to a method for estimating the climatic effectivity of precipitation as recommended by MOHR. By this method—instead of using longterm monthly averages-for each year of the period of observation the number of dry months is determined separately (fig. 8, table I). The average number of dry months per year obtained in this way provides the ecologist with more rehable figures than e. g. the Köppen method does, which works with long-term averages and which, moreover, gives no weight to the length of the dry season(s). In default of empirical data on water requirements of the vegetation in Suriname, in our provisional classification of the rainfall stations in N Suriname, a month is called dry if the total amount of rainfall is less than 60 mm, and wet if the latter exceeds 100 mm. These critical values are based on the outcome of studies carried out elsewhere in the tropics. The 100 -mm limit is supported to some degree by data on potential evapotranspiration and discharge values in the basin of the Upper-Suriname R. Applying this method to N. Suriname the average number of dry months varies for most of the stations (with exception of the narrow coastal belt) between 1. 5 and 1. 8 per annum, the short dry season comprising 0. 3 - 0. 5 months, the long one 0. 9 - 1. 4 months. A disadvantage attaching to this method is the obscuring effect of the averaging upon the strong variation in the severity of the yearly period(s) of drought with its intendant fluctuations in the yearly total amount of rainfall. The years of great drought, although occurring exceptionally and irregularly (figs. 6 and 8), probably are a differential factor of considerable ecological significance, which strongly accentuates the differences in available soil moisture existing between soils with different texture and drainage. Moreover, these severe drought periods may exercise an indirect influence upon the vegetation because they create conditions favourable to extensive fires due to human activities. Accordingly, for a better characterization of the dry periods a method was used which is described in detail; an essential feature of this method is the calculation of 30 -days’ moving totals, which are set out graphically in figs. 7 - 9. A day is tentatively called dry when in the preceding 30 days less than 60 mm has been recorded. For the station Republiek the length of the longest yearly dry period varied in the last 50 years between 0 and 105 days (fig. 8). When the narrow coastal belt is left out of consideration, it appears that the differences in over-all climate, viz. air temperature, total rainfall per annum and climatic effectivity of rainfall (as determined by each of the above mentioned methods), show from an ecological point of view but little variation for the stations in N Suriname; the marked differences in aspect as well as in floristic composition shown by the forest in this region are, therefore, certainly not due to these climatic differences. In the following chapters of the first part the methods and the results of the micro-climatic studies are discussed. The measurements give a picture of the daily and seasonal variation observed during two full years and during the very dry season of 1957. Light intensity (in the range of ca 3500 - 8500 Å) was measured at different heights in the undergrowth of mesophytic and of xeromorphic forest and in a large clearing by means of a spherical photometer (fig. 12). The advantages and limitations of this method are described in 1. 3. 2. The “daylight factor” (i. e. the ratio between illumination inside and outside the forest) in the undergrowth averaged roughly 2 %; for “vertical illumination” (as measured with a plane-surface photocell, held in a horizontal position) this factor approached a value of 3 %. These figures are considerably higher than those recorded for mesophytic forests elsewhere in the tropics. This is partly {{due to the fact that}} other investigators only measured “shadow light” and left patches of bright light out of consideration. The argument that the latter should be left out of the sets of readings because (1) the plants of the undergrowth are adapted to low light intensities and are unable to profit by short bursts of strong light, and (2) above a certain limit the photosynthetic effect of light falls off progressively with increasing intensity, are based mainly on the results of laboratory studies on photosynthesis of individual plant organs or cellsuspensions, which should not he applied unreservedly to whole plants or communities. A few preliminary observations made on the growth of seedlings and saplings of woody species from the Suriname forest gave indications that their growth rate does not approach asymptotically to a limiting value lying below that of full sunlight; all of the species which were investigated showed their maximum growth at full light in large clearings. The method of sampling light intensity in the forest that was used in the present study was discussed in detail in 1. 3. 3; samples were systematically taken along random line transects and, accordingly, included both the enormous spatial as well as temporal variations in light intensity that are encountered under a vegetational cover of complex structure (cf. table II and figs. 14 - 18). Examples of the results of many series of readings are given in table II and are shown as frequency polygons in figs. 15 and 18. For the computation of the average daily march of mean light intensity at different levels in the forest (figs. 16 and 17) the arithmetic averages of the series of readings have been used (cf. 1. 3. 2). Total illumination, as measured with the spherical meter, at ½ m height in mesophytic forest, averaged 12 x 103 ergs/sec/cm 2 0 between 7 and 17 hr. in the dry season (i. e. during days with the sun unobscured during ca. 85 % of the time). For the plane-surface photometer (<b>vertical</b> <b>illumination)</b> a value of 8 x 103 ergs/sec/cm 2 was computed. The average daily amount of luminous energy received during such days by the undergrowth (at 1 ½ m) was ca. 22 x 107 ergs/cm 2 ø (15 x 107 ergs/cm 2 with a plane-surface meter). A rough estimate of the spectral composition of the illumination in the forest was made by means of measurements made with a plane-surface meter and 3 glass filters (red, green, yellow, cf. fig. 11). The results of the measurements (cf. 1. 3. 5) indicated a considerable increase in the blue and violet end of the visible spectrum (ca. 3500 - 5000 Å) and also an increase in the transmission of the forest canopy in the red part beyond ca. 6100 Å (fig. 19, table III). The blue-red shade found in the undergrowth of the Mapane forest, corresponds in its spectral composition to the shade light found in African forests and in some deciduous forests in temperate regions. Atmospheric humidity and evaporation at various levels in mesophytic forest and in the open were discussed in the sections 1. 4 and 1. 5. The variation in these factors closely followed the rather irregular pattern of rainfall distribution. Though humidity reaches its minimum during the long dry season, even during this season dry periods are interrupted regularly by periods consisting of one or more humid and wet days, whereas the 8 wettest months are frequently interrupted by successions of rainless days (figs. 7 - 9, 30, 35). Accordingly it is difficult to find a general characterization of the march of humidity at various sites, and reference must be made to the graphs which are reproduced in figs. 22 - 36. The humidity records for the various sites and seasons resemble each other in the presence of a long nightly period in which humidity approaches or reaches saturation; even at the height of a very dry season, during the driest day on record, in the forest undergrowth saturation deficit dropped below 2 ½ mm (rel. humidity rose above 90 %) during 9 hrs. (fig. 28). In the 8 wettest months of the year saturation deficit in the undergrowth (at 1 ½ m) only rarely rose above a value of 6 mm (rel. hum. fell below 80 %) for more than one hour per day. During drought periods humidity can drop to rather low values even in the mesophytic forest (figs. 26 - 29, 33) and a saturation deficit of 15 mm (rel. hum. 55 %) was not seldom recorded. From readings made simultaneously in an extensive clearing in the forest, it appeared that the humidity, evaporation and temperature prevailing in the two stations resembled each other very closely, and accordingly the records for the clearing are considered to represent also the atmospheric conditions just above the canopy. It appeared that in the dry season(s) saturation deficit in the open could rise to considerable heights (figs. 23 - 25, 28, 32, 33); during the 8 wettest months it seldom reached a value of 12 mm (rel. hum. 60 %) for longer than ¼ hr. /day, but during the 2 driest months the deficit generally rose above 12 mm (rel. hum. below 40 %) during at least 1 hr. /day, and values above 20 mm (rel. hum. 45 %) were recorded repeatedly during more than one hour on end. During a very dry season a deficit of 22 mm (rel. hum. 42 %) is reached nearly every day for at least 2 hours, thus approaching values similar to those reported in desert regions. Yet, even during the driest periods there is a long night period of high humidity (fig. 28). Although the atmospheric humidity of the rain forest in Suriname showed a lower average and reached considerably lower minima than e. g. in Africa, it is uncertain whether these differences are real, because the records from other forests probably did not show the full seasonal range of humidity (1. 4. 5). During the present study extensive use was made of a set of Piche evaporimeters, although we were fully aware of the limited value of data which are obtained with an instrument that by its nature can never fully integrate the effect of various stimuli to water loss in exactly the same manner in which this is done by plants. Yet the use of a mechanical device that measures the integrated effect of the various factors by which transpiration is promoted may provide data of great ecological value, notably for comparative purposes. The advantages and limitations of the values obtained with Piche evaporimeters were discussed in 1. 5. 1 and 1. 5. 2. It appeared that the readings of capillary evaporation, especially when averaged over longer periods, may provide a very convenient measure of the relative differences in atmospheric humidity in various habitats (figs. 30, 31, 34, 45). In the forest the seasonal differences in air temperature appeared to be rather small (fig. 31), owing to the small range of the seasonal variations in overall air temperature. The daily maximum in the undergrowth of mesophytic forest generally varied between 25 ° and 30 ° C, and the minima between 20 ° and 22 ° C. The data on air temperature have been summarized in table V, and are shown graphically in figs. 31, 37 - 40. The soil temperature under forest cover showed only very small seasonal and daily variations, and at a depth of 2 cm presumably never exceeds a value of 28 ° C. The data have been summarized in table V and are shown graphically in figs. 41 - 44. The maximum range of temperature observed at 75 cm depth under closed forest remained below 2 °. It may safely be assumed that a single reading at this depth may serve as a close approximation of the long-term average of air temperature in the undergrowth. Although being small, the differences in soil temperature under different types of vegetation appeared to provide a useful, integrating index of environmental factors, as illustrated in fig. 45. In a large clearing, where the bare soil is insolated throughout the day, down to a depth of 75 cm the average temperature is considerably more than 25 ° C, which is the critical value above which destruction of organic matter in the soil is assumed to proceed at a higher rate than its deposition. In savanna forest (xeromorphous forest) intensity of illumination, air temperature, evaporation, saturation deficit and soil temperature were on the average higher than in mesophytic (rain) forest, and showed somewhat greater daily and seasonal amplitudes. During the greater part of the year the differences were very small, but they became larger during the dry season (figs. 22, 27, 31, 36, 37, 39, 44, 45). The second part deals with the soils of the regions where our ecological studies were carried out. Two main geomorphological units are recognizable in this area (II. 2. 1, II. 3) : (1) the Old cristalline Basement which is of Pre-cambrian age and which in the area under consideration consists mainly of acidic, highly metamorphous rocks with igneous intrusions; (2) the Zanderij formation which forms the nearly flat “cover landscape” between the Basement and the Coastal Sediment series. The soil studies were chiefly carried out in the transitional zone between the two formation(-series) : Mapane- and Upper-Coesewijne-region, and were described in sections II. 2 and II. 3 (cf. figs. 1 - 3, 46, 48, 53, 54). In this region the surface of the Basement Complex, which is the remnant of a very old peneplain, is undulating to fairly flat, dissected by numerous creeks and gullies; the soils vary from sandy clays to loamy coarse sands, and for the greater part are covered with (sub-) mesophytic lowland forest. Farther inland, ferrallitic soils — with abundant pisolithic ironstone gravel in the upper horizons — may predominate (II. 4) and, locally on plateaus, very shallow soils may cover a sheet of lateritic ironstone (ferrite/ferrobauxite); the forest (III. 4) is sub-mesophytic or (sub-) xeromorphous hillforest. The “Zanderij sands” which form the oldest non-consolidated sediments, vary from bleached coarse sands (with open savanna/savanna forest) to red sandy clay-loams (with sub-mesophytic forest). Although it was not our intention to develop a classification of the forest soils found in the lowlands of central Suriname, behind the coastal belt, the soil profiles were divided into 4 groups, depending on the degree of drainage, viz.; impeded, partially impeded, free, or excessive; the ferrallitic soils were kept apart. The distribution of the main types of vegetation on the nutritionally poor soils behind the coastal belt (figs. 46 and 53), presumably is mainly controlled by physical features on which the moisture relations in the soil depend; mesophytic forest is found on mesic sites, viz. on well-aerated soils where water-supply is sufficient throughout the greater part of the year. The results of the laboratory analyses (tables VI-XI) show that the majority of the soils in the sites studied, though varying in some of their characteristics (structure, texture, topography, parent materials) share many qualities which may be regarded as being typical for the majority of the soils of the rain-forest belt: in texture they are loamy to clayey, but invariably sandy, especially in the upper horizons; they are invariably acid, and are highly deficient in exchangeable bases (particularly in calcium and phosphorus), the kaolinitic clay-kolloid being strongly degraded; their organic-matter content is rather low, and the narrow C/N ratio — which is noted even in the upper horizons — indicates that humification is nearly complete and must take place very rapidly. The soils are practically devoid of weatherable minerals. The parent rock is weathered down to considerable depth and practically is split up in quartz (gravel, sand, silt), kaolin and iron (in the ferro-form in the soil solution and as ferri in coatings on the quartz grains and occasionally in the form of iron concretions). The base exchange capacity of kaolinite being very low, the humus colloids form the only adsorption complex of any importance. In the Mapane area the soil was sampled systematically in a 50 -ha complex with the principal object to ascertain how much the soil varied over a small area, and to what extend variations in soil factors might account for the striking irregularities of the distributional pattern of the trees. As a matter of fact individuals of many species in stands of mesophytic forest show a non-random distribution (II. 2. 3, IV. 5, figs. 47, 50, 52, 69); for the majority of the species studied no correlation could be found between their distribution and definite soil properties (II. 2. 3). Only for two species such a correlation could be ascertained (II. 2. 3, figs. 50, 52). The peculiar distribution of Vouacapoua americana (fig. 46) was discussed in detail in II. 2. 3. By means of distributional maps for two important tree species in small areas in the Upper-Coesewijne region (figs. 55 - 57) the very wide ecological amplitude of many tree species of the mesophytic forest is demonstrated. Combined data on pore space and soil moisture, being of paramount ecological interest, were determined (by means of constant-volume rings) at different depths of the soil profile for a range of soil types. Methods and results are discussed in section II. 6. The porosity figures given in table XII show that the total pore volume in the upper horizons of soils under forest cover is within wide limits independent of the mechanical composition of the soil, and varies between 39 - 47 % in the main zone of biological activity in the profile. As might have been expected, soil moisture appeared to he strongly correlated with the mechanical composition of the soil (fig. 59, tables XII-XIV). It was made plausible that the occurrence of mottling in the soil profile is connected with an interference in aeration during at least part of the year. The third part deals with a number of botanical surveys carried out in various types of mesophytic forest. Here too it was not the intention to arrive at a sociological classification, but we merely wished to obtain an impression of the order of magnitude of the differences found in these types of forest. To this end sample plots of 0. 3 - 1 ha were divided into squares of 10 x 10 m; in each of these quadrats all trees of 5 cm d. b. h. and over were identified and measured. In 10 % of the quadrats also the undergrowth of 2 - 4 ½ cm d. b. h. was enumerated. The method of quadrating is described in III. 1, in which section also emphasize was laid on the fact that both the size of the sample plots and of the quadrats was arbitrarily chosen; the present investigations are only meant to give a first insight in the order of magnitude of the variability existing in the composition of the forest in a small area (Mapane region) as well as over larger distances. The studies were carried out in stands of mesophytic forest belonging to the same “floristic” or “natural” area, which means that every species that was encountered in the sample plots has a natural range which is greater than the region under consideration. Yet, as was clearly demonstrated, the floristic composition of the forests which were sampled showed marked differences (tables XVII and XVIII). The heterogeneity of what is supposed to be a single stand on homogeneous (?) soil appears from the tables in which the results of enumerations in neighbouring plots are given (e. g. tables XIX-XXI). The forest on mesic sites in Suriname is typical mixed forest in that it shows the same pecularities in the distribution of the constituent species as have been described for other equatorial countries: the forest seldom shows any tendency towards single-species dominance; the composition shows distinct variations from place to place; each of the sample plots shows a different assemblage of relatively abundant, “leading” species. The latter do not exceed 20 in number, although in the whole of Suriname there are in the mesophytic forest at least some 200 species of large trees, the majority of which never become codominant. The preliminary study of the forest in Suriname indicates that it might be possible to distinguish geographic regions, within which the forest on mesic sites shows approximately the same group of “leading” species (although within such a region the relative numerical importance of each of the “leading” species shows considerable fluctuations from one place to another). Notwithstanding these heterogeneities the average floristic composition remains more or less the same in such a geographic region. Although it is admitted that some sor...|$|E
