25|$|In another study, 73 {{subjects}} were randomized to receive <b>valaciclovir</b> 1 g daily or placebo for 60 days each in a 2-way crossover design. A daily swab of the genital area was self-collected for HSV-2 detection by polymerase chain reaction, {{in order to}} compare the effect of <b>valaciclovir</b> 1 g once daily for 60 days versus placebo on asymptomatic viral shedding in immunocompetent, HSV-2 seropositive subjects without a history of symptomatic genital herpes infection. The study found that <b>valaciclovir</b> significantly reduced shedding during subclinical days compared to placebo, showing a 71% reduction. 84% of subjects had no shedding while receiving <b>valaciclovir</b> versus 54% of subjects on placebo. 88% of patients treated with <b>valaciclovir</b> had no recognized signs or symptoms versus 77% for placebo.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{there was}} no {{significant}} difference in preventing the incidence of PHN found in the one RCT included in the meta-analysis that compared placebo to PO famciclovir treatment within 72 hours of HZ rash onset.

25|$|Herpes viruses {{establish}} lifelong infections, and {{the virus}} cannot yet be eradicated from the body. Treatment usually involves general-purpose antiviral drugs {{that interfere with}} viral replication, reduce the physical severity of outbreak-associated lesions, and lower the chance of transmission to others.

500|$|Condoms offer {{moderate}} {{protection against}} HSV-2 in {{both men and}} women, with consistent condom users having a 30%-lower risk of HSV-2 acquisition compared with those who never use condoms. A female condom can provide greater protection than the male condom, as it covers the labia. The virus cannot pass through a synthetic condom, but a male condom's effectiveness is limited [...] because herpes ulcers may appear on areas not covered by it. Neither type of condom prevents contact with the scrotum, anus, buttocks, or upper thighs, areas that may {{come in contact with}} ulcers or genital secretions during sexual activity. Protection against herpes simplex depends {{on the site of the}} ulcer; therefore, if ulcers appear on areas not covered by condoms, abstaining from sexual activity until the ulcers are fully healed is one way to limit risk of transmission. The risk is not eliminated, however, as viral shedding capable of transmitting infection may still occur while the infected partner is asymptomatic. The use of condoms or dental dams also limits the transmission of herpes from the genitals of one partner to the mouth of the other (or vice versa) during oral sex. When one partner has a herpes simplex infection and the other does not, the use of antiviral medication, such as <b>valaciclovir,</b> in conjunction with a condom, further decreases the chances of transmission to the uninfected partner. Topical microbicides that contain chemicals that directly inactivate the virus and block viral entry are being investigated.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the onset}} of an {{infection}} is difficult to predict, lasts {{a short period of}} time and heals rapidly, it is difficult to conduct research on cold sores.

50|$|<b>Valaciclovir</b> belongs from {{a family}} of {{molecules}} first described and patented by P.Cornaglia Ferraris in 1982 (patents EP0077460 A2, CA1258149A1, DE3273785D1, EP0077460A3, EP0077460B1, US4567182). <b>Valaciclovir</b> is a prodrug, an esterified version of aciclovir that has greater oral bioavailability (about 55%) than aciclovir (10-20%). It is converted by esterases to the active drug aciclovir, as well as the amino acid valine, via hepatic first-pass metabolism. Aciclovir is selectively converted into a monophosphate form by viral thymidine kinase, which is far more effective (3000 times) in phosphorylation of aciclovir than cellular thymidine kinase. Subsequently, the monophosphate form is further phosphorylated into the active triphosphate form, aciclo-GTP, by cellular kinases. Aciclo-GTP is a very potent inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase; it has approximately 100 times higher affinity to viral than cellular polymerase. Its monophosphate form also incorporates into the viral DNA, resulting in chain termination. It has also been shown that the viral enzymes cannot remove aciclo-GMP from the chain, which results in inhibition of further activity of DNA polymerase. Aciclo-GTP is fairly rapidly metabolised within the cell, possibly by cellular phosphatases.|$|E
50|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (≥1% of patients) {{associated with}} <b>valaciclovir</b> therapy {{are the same}} as for aciclovir, its active metabolite, and include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and headache. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1-1% of patients) include: agitation, vertigo, confusion, dizziness, edema, arthralgia, sore throat, constipation, abdominal pain, rash, weakness and/or renal impairment. Rare adverse effects (<0.1% of patients) include: coma, seizures, neutropenia, leukopenia, tremor, ataxia, encephalopathy, psychotic symptoms, crystalluria, anorexia, fatigue, hepatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and/or anaphylaxis.|$|E
50|$|The charges {{stemmed from}} GSK's {{promotion}} of the anti-depressants Paxil (paroxetine) and Wellbutrin (bupropion) for unapproved uses from 1998-2003, specifically as suitable for patients {{under the age of}} 18, and from its failure to report safety data about Avandia (rosiglitazone), both in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Other drugs promoted for unapproved uses were two inhalers, Advair (fluticasone/salmeterol) and Flovent (fluticasone propionate), as well as Zofran (ondansetron), Imitrex (sumatriptan), Lotronex (alosetron) and Valtrex (<b>valaciclovir).</b>|$|E
50|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Condom use decreases the risk somewhat. Daily antiviral medication taken {{by someone who}} has the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected, there is no cure.

50|$|Antiviral drugs {{may reduce}} the {{severity}} and duration of shingles; however, they do not prevent postherpetic neuralgia. Of these drugs, aciclovir has been the standard treatment, but the new drugs <b>valaciclovir</b> and famciclovir demonstrate similar or superior efficacy and good safety and tolerability. The drugs are used both for prevention (for example in HIV/AIDS) and as therapy during the acute phase. Complications in immunocompromised individuals with shingles may be reduced with intravenous aciclovir. In {{people who are at}} a high risk for repeated attacks of shingles, five daily oral doses of aciclovir are usually effective.|$|E
50|$|The Cotard {{delusion}} {{also has}} {{resulted from a}} patient's adverse physiological response to a drug (e.g., aciclovir) and to its prodrug precursor (e.g., <b>valaciclovir).</b> The occurrence of Cotard delusion symptoms {{was associated with a}} high serum-concentration of 9-Carboxymethoxymethylguanine (CMMG), the principal metabolite of the drug aciclovir. As such, the patient with weak kidneys (impaired renal function) continued risking the occurrence of delusional symptoms, despite the reduction of the dose of aciclovir. Hemodialysis resolved the patient's delusions (of negating the Self) within hours of treatment, which suggests that the occurrence of Cotard-delusion symptoms might not always be cause for psychiatric hospitalization of the patient.|$|E
50|$|Several {{studies in}} humans and mice provide {{evidence}} that early treatment with famciclovir soon after the first infection with herpes can significantly lower the chance of future outbreaks. Use of famciclovir in this manner {{has been shown to}} reduce the amount of latent virus in the neural ganglia compared to no treatment or treatment with <b>valaciclovir.</b> A review of human subjects treated for five days with famciclovir 250 mg three times daily during their first herpes episode found that only 4.2 percent experienced a recurrence within six months after the first outbreak, a fivefold decrease compared to the 19 percent recurrence in acyclovir-treated patients. Neither drug affected latency if treatment was delayed for several months.|$|E
5000|$|Resistance {{can develop}} quickly {{with as little}} as one mutation. [...] Mutations occur in the enzymes that phosphorylate the drug and {{activate}} it: {{in the case of}} herpes simplex, resistance to aciclovir arises thanks to a mutation affecting the viral enzyme thymidine kinase. Since nucleoside analogues require two phosphorylations to be activated, one carried out by a viral enzyme and the other by enzymes in the host cell, mutations in viral thymidine kinase interfere with the first of these phosphorylations; in such cases the drug remains ineffective. There are, however, several different nucleoside analogue drugs and resistance to one of them is usually overcome by switching to another drug of the same kind (e. g. famciclovir, penciclovir, <b>valaciclovir).</b>|$|E
50|$|An April 2013 Cochrane Collaboration {{meta-analysis}} of 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating oral antiviral medications given within 72 {{hours after the}} onset of herpes zoster rash in immunocompetent people for preventing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) found {{no significant difference between}} placebo and acyclovir. Combining four RCTs, 44.1% of the acyclovir treatment group developed herpetic neuralgia whereas 53.3% of the placebo group developed herpetic neuralgia. Heterogeneity between the four RCTs was moderate: Chi2 =3.36, df = 2 (P=0.19); I2 = 40%.Additionally, {{there was no significant difference}} in preventing the incidence of PHN found in the one RCT included in the meta-analysis that compared placebo to PO famciclovir treatment within 72 hours of HZ rash onset. Studies using <b>valaciclovir</b> treatment were not included in the meta-analysis.PHN was defined as pain at the site of the dermatomic rash at 120 days after the onset of rash, and incidence was evaluated at 1, 4, and 6 months after rash onset.There was a slight reduction in the incidence of pain at 4 weeks after the onset of rash in the aciclovir group (153 study participants with pain out of 347 study participants in the aciclovir group) versus the placebo group (184 study participants with pain out of 345 study participants in the placebo group). Patients who are prescribed PO antiviral agents after the onset of rash should be informed that their chances of developing PHN are no different than those not taking PO antiviral agents.|$|E
