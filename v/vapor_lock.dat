2500|$|Majeski raced {{four times}} during the LaCrosse Oktoberfest weekend; he won the late model feature on Thursday night, the Dick Trickle 99 on Friday night, the JMcK 63 Big 8 Series race on Saturday night. With 10 laps to go, he was leading the ARCA Midwest Tour race on Sunday when a <b>vapor</b> <b>lock</b> caused his car to {{temporarily}} lose power on a restart; he finished third. Majeski traveled across the United States to Florida for the Governor's Cup at New Smyrna Speedway in November. He started 27th after an A-arm broke in qualifying. After passing up through the entire field, Majeski held off Steven Wallace on numerous restarts to take the win. Dale Earnhardt, Jr. tweeted about Majeski's win calling him [...] "the Deal". At the Snowball Derby, Majeski qualified second quickest and was awarded the pole position after Christopher Bell's Kyle Busch Motorsports entry was disqualified.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>vapor</b> <b>locking</b> potential, automotive gasoline {{does not have}} the same quality tracking as aviation gasoline.

40|$|Introduction and Background Large {{amounts of}} methane in well {{water is a}} wide spread problem in North America. Methane gas from {{decaying}} biomass and oil and gas deposits escape into water wells typically through cracks or faults in otherwise non-porous rock strata producing saturated water systems. This methane saturated water can pose several problems {{in the delivery of}} drinking water. The problems range from pumps <b>vapor</b> <b>locking</b> (cavitating), to pump houses exploding. The City of Marsing requested Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to assist with some water analyses as well as to provide some engineering approaches to methane capture through the INL Technical Assistance Program (TAP). There are several engineering approaches to the removal of methane and natural gas from water sources that include gas stripping followed by compression and/or dehydration; membrane gas separators coupled with dehydration processes, membrane water contactors with dehydration processes...|$|R
50|$|Fuel-air mixture was {{generated}} by a Solex 4A1 carburetor. It is of the double-register type, as with the previous model W114. That means {{each of the two}} sets of mixing systems feeds three cylinders and each of these two sets is composed of a first relatively small mixing system for idling and a second, larger mixing system for higher load and higher speeds. At idle and up to about one-third load only the smaller tube of each set is mechanically operated by the accelerator pedal, while the second tube of each set is enabled by a vacuum cell only at high load and high engine speed. All four (2 x 2) tubes are supplied with fuel by a central float chamber. The engine is equipped with gasoline feed line and gasoline return line (which usually was more typical for fuel injection engines) achieving a cooling effect which protects from <b>vapor</b> <b>locks,</b> that would cause starting problems in hot weather.|$|R
2500|$|But {{from first}} to last, the Commando {{remained}} a headache. It could be kept flying {{only at the}} cost of thousands of extra man-hours for maintenance and modification. Although Curtiss-Wright reported the accumulation by November 1943 of the astounding total of 721 required changes in production models, the plane continued to be what maintenance crews around the world aptly described as a [...] "plumber's nightmare." [...] Worse still, the plane was a killer. In the experienced hands of Eastern Air Lines and along a route that provided more favorable flying conditions than were confronted by military crews in Africa and on the Hump route into China, the plane did well enough. Indeed, Eastern Air Lines lost only one C-46 in more than two years of operation. But among the ATC pilots the Commando was known, with good reason, as the [...] "flying coffin." [...] From May 1943 to March 1945, Air Transport Command received reports of thirty-one instances in which C-46s caught fire or exploded in the air. Still others were listed merely as [...] "missing in flight," [...] and it is a safe assumption that many of these exploded, went down in flames, or crashed as the result of <b>vapor</b> <b>lock,</b> carburetor icing, or other defects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vapor</b> <b>lock</b> was {{a common}} {{occurrence}} in stock car racing, since the cars have traditionally used gasoline and carburetors.

50|$|A <b>vapor</b> <b>lock</b> is {{more likely}} to develop when the vehicle is in traffic because the under-hood {{temperature}} tends to rise. A <b>vapor</b> <b>lock</b> can also develop when the engine is stopped while hot and the vehicle is parked for a short period. The fuel in the line near the engine does not move and can thus heat up sufficiently to form a <b>vapor</b> <b>lock.</b> The problem {{is more likely}} in hot weather or high altitude in either case.|$|E
5000|$|Carburetor units may not {{effectively}} {{deal with}} fuel vapor {{being delivered to}} the float chamber. Most designs incorporate a pressure balance duct linking {{the top of the}} float bowl with either the intake to the carburetor or the outside air. Even if the pump can handle <b>vapor</b> <b>locks</b> effectively, fuel <b>vapor</b> entering the float bowl has to be vented. If this is done via the intake system, the mixture is, in effect, enriched, creating a mixture control and pollution issue. If it is done by venting to the outside, the result is direct hydrocarbon pollution and an effective loss of fuel efficiency and possibly a fuel odor problem. For this reason, some fuel delivery systems allow fuel vapor to be returned to the fuel tank to be condensed back to the liquid phase, or using an active carbon filled canister where fuel vapor is absorbed. This is usually implemented by removing fuel vapor from the fuel line near the engine rather than from the float bowl. Such a system may also divert excess fuel pressure from the pump back to the tank.|$|R

50|$|The first {{automotive}} {{direct injection}} system {{used to run}} on gasoline was developed under Hans Scherenberg’s leadership, and was introduced by Goliath and Gutbrod in 1952 to power some of their two-stroke cars. This system made by Bosch was basically a high-pressure diesel direct-injection pump with an intake throttle valve set up. (Diesels only change the amount of fuel injected to vary output; there is no throttle.) It used a normal gasoline fuel pump, to provide fuel to a mechanically driven injection pump, which had separate plungers per injector to deliver a very high injection pressure directly into the combustion chamber. The two-stroke vehicles showed very good performance and up to 30% less fuel consumption over the carburetor version, primarily under low engine loads. The cars enjoyed an extra benefit as the injection system also metered lubricant into the engine from a dedicated oil tank, obviating the need for owners to mix their own two-stroke fuel blend. A portion of the oil was combined with fuel in the injection pump to lubricate the cylinders and piston rings, the rest was ported to the air intake to lubricate the crankcase. But the cars were expensive and difficult to start when the engine was warm due to <b>vapor</b> <b>locks.</b> Also, very few people knew about direct injection, and the injection pumps needed frequent adjustment. Branded repair shops and Bosch services became overloaded, and many cars were converted to carburetor. These two-stroke engines were soon superseded by four-strokes.|$|R

40|$|The {{dissipation}} of {{the tidal}} energy deposited on eccentric planets may induce a heating {{of the planet}} that affects its atmospheric thermal structure. Here we study the influence of tidal heating on the atmospheric composition of the eccentric (e = 0. 16) "hot Neptune" GJ 436 b, for which inconclusive chemical abundances are retrieved from multiwavelength photometric observations carried out during primary transit and secondary eclipse. We build up a one-dimensional model of GJ 436 b's atmosphere in the vertical direction and compute the pressure-temperature and molecular abundances profiles for various plausible internal temperatures of the planet (up to 560 K) and metallicities (from solar to 100 times solar), using a radiative-convective model and a chemical model which includes thermochemical kinetics, vertical mixing, and photochemistry. We find that the CO/CH 4 abundance ratio increases with metallicity and tidal heating, and ranges from 1 / 20 to 1000 within the ranges of metallicity and internal temperature explored. Water <b>vapor</b> <b>locks</b> most of the oxygen and reaches a very high abundance, whatever the metallicity and internal temperature of the planet. The CO 2 /H 2 O abundance ratio increases dramatically with metallicity, and takes values between 10 - 5 - 10 - 4 with solar elemental abundances and ~ 0. 1 for a metallicity 100 times solar. None of the atmospheric models based on solid physical and chemical grounds provide a fully satisfactory agreement with available observational data, although the comparison of calculated spectra and observations seems to point to models with a high metallicity and efficient tidal heating, in which high CO/CH 4 abundance ratios and warm temperatures in the dayside atmosphere are favored. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The last flying {{example of}} a C.IV is a C.IVa with a Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII engine, {{preserved}} at the Owls Head Transportation Museum in Owls Head, Maine. It was used in a trans-Pacific attempt in the late 1920s or early 1930s. Pilots Bob Wark and Eddie Brown took out {{the seats in the}} passenger compartment and installed a large fuel tank. They also put a small cockpit {{just in front of the}} vertical stabilizer with a hand-powered fuel pump inside. In flight, the crew member sitting there would transfer fuel to the main tank in the wing, where it would be fed by gravity into the engine. In this trans-Pacific attempt they planned not to go straight across the Pacific but up the West Coast of North America to Alaska and down the chain of Aleutian Islands, proceeding down the Chinese coast to Tokyo. They took off from Tacoma, Washington and started to head north, but made it only about 100 miles of the way to Vancouver, British Columbia when the engine <b>vapor</b> <b>locked</b> and forced a landing in a field. They had to dump most of their fuel to bring down the weight in order to take off from the field. When they got back in the air, they started heading for nearby Ladner Field, Vancouver to top off the tanks, but they crashed upon landing and decided to give up. They loaded the C.IV onto a Ford AA flatbed truck and brought it back to Washington State. It ended up in Ephrata, Washington, where it was kept outdoors and was eventually badly burned in a grass fire. It sat until 1970, when one of the museum's trustees found it and restored it and donated it to the museum. It flies to this very day.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{observation}} of a Zeeman shift (order of 100 MHz) of the Doppler-broadened D 2 transition of both 85 Rb and 87 Rb isotopes via transmission through a tapered optical nanofiber {{in the presence of}} a DC magnetic field. Linearly-polarized light propagating in the nanofiber is analyzed as a superposition of two orthogonally circularly-polarized orientations, σ+ and σ-. In the absence of the magnetic field, the absorption of these polarizations by the atomic vapor, via the evanescent field at the waist of the nanofiber, is degenerate. When a weak magnetic field is applied parallel to the propagating light, this degeneracy is lifted and relative shifts in the resonance frequencies are detected. Typical linear shift rates of 1. 6 MHz/G and - 2. 0 MHz/G were observed. We also demonstrate a dichroic atomic <b>vapor</b> laser <b>lock</b> line shape by monitoring the real-time subtraction of the two magnetically-shifted absorption spectra.

5000|$|The {{higher the}} {{volatility}} of the fuel, {{the more likely it}} is that <b>vapor</b> <b>lock</b> will occur. Historically, gasoline was a more volatile distillate than it is now and was more prone to <b>vapor</b> <b>lock.</b> Conversely, diesel fuel is far less volatile than gasoline, so that diesel engines almost never suffer from <b>vapor</b> <b>lock.</b> However, diesel engine fuel systems are far more susceptible to air locks in their fuel lines, because standard diesel fuel injection pumps rely on the fuel being non-compressible. Air locks are caused by air leaking into the fuel delivery line or entering from the tank. Air locks are eliminated by turning the engine over for a time using the starter motor, or by bleeding the fuel system.|$|E

50|$|Most modern {{engines are}} {{equipped}} with fuel injection, and have an electric submersible fuel pump in the fuel tank. Moving the fuel pump to {{the interior of the}} tank helps prevent <b>vapor</b> <b>lock,</b> since the entire fuel delivery system is under positive pressure and the fuel pump runs cooler than if it is located in the engine compartment. This is the primary reason that <b>vapor</b> <b>lock</b> is rare in modern fuel systems. For the same reason, some carbureted engines are retrofitted with an electric fuel pump near the fuel tank.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vapor</b> <b>lock</b> was {{far more}} common in older {{gasoline}} fuel systems incorporating a low-pressure mechanical fuel pump driven by the engine, located in the engine compartment and feeding a carburetor. Such pumps were typically located higher than the fuel tank, were directly heated by the engine and fed fuel directly to the float bowl inside the carburetor. Fuel was drawn under negative pressure (gauge pressure) from the feed line, increasing {{the risk of a}} <b>vapor</b> <b>lock</b> developing between the tank and pump. A <b>vapor</b> <b>lock</b> being drawn into the fuel pump could disrupt the fuel pressure long enough for the float chamber in the carburetor to partially or completely drain, causing fuel starvation in the engine. Even temporary disruption of fuel supply into the float chamber is not ideal; most carburetors are designed to run at a fixed level of fuel in the float bowl and reducing the level will reduce the fuel to air mixture delivered to the engine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Vapor</b> <b>lock</b> {{typically}} {{occurs in}} fuel systems where a mechanically-driven fuel pump {{mounted on the}} engine draws fuel from a tank mounted lower than the pump. The reduced pressure in the line can cause the more volatile components in automotive gasoline to flash into vapor, forming bubbles in the fuel line and interrupting fuel flow. If an electric boost pump is mounted in the fuel tank to push fuel toward the engine, as is common practice in fuel-injected automobiles, the fuel pressure in the lines is maintained above ambient pressure, preventing bubble formation. Likewise, if the fuel tank is mounted above the engine and fuel flows primarily due to gravity, as in a high-wing airplane, <b>vapor</b> <b>lock</b> cannot occur, using either aviation or automotive fuels. Fuel-injected engines in automobiles also usually have a [...] "fuel return" [...] line to send unused fuel back to the tank, which has the benefit of equalizing the fuel's temperature throughout the system, further reducing the chance for <b>vapor</b> <b>lock</b> from developing.|$|E
