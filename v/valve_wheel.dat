It had not gone out, although the flame had sunk to a faint red jet {{that would not be}} seen in the dust. His hands shook, but he gave the pump a few strokes and turned the <b>valve</b> <b>wheel.</b> The red jet got white and leaped higher and Lister, pumping hard, looked up the track. Big cars, rocking and banging, rushed past in a cloud of dust. Bits of gravel struck him and rattled against the lamp. The blurred, dark figures of men who sat upon the load cut against the fan-shaped beam, and in the background he saw a shower of leaping sparks.|$|E

50|$|The school {{continues}} downriver. Waxman and Mengers {{arrive at}} the water park to intercept Grogan and Maggie, but the piranha attack the resort and kill many vacationers and Waxman. Grogan and Maggie commandeer a speedboat and rush to the shuttered smelting plant at the narrowest point of the river. Remembering the empty facility pond, Grogan realizes the fish can survive in salt water; if the school passes the delta, they will reach the ocean and spread over the world. He intends to open the smelting refuse tanks, hoping the industrial waste will kill the fish. They {{arrive at the}} plant ahead of the fish, but the elevated water level has submerged the control office, and Grogan must go underwater; he ties a rope around his waist and instructs Maggie to count to 100 before pulling him out. Grogan struggles to move the rusted <b>valve</b> <b>wheel</b> when the school arrives and attacks him. The assault hyperadrenalizes him, and he manages to open the valves just as Maggie pulls him to safety. Maggie takes Grogan back to the water park, where a massive MEDEVAC is tending to the victims; his injuries are severe and he is seen in a catatonic state.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} how height of a hand wheel affects maximum torque production and risk of injury to the shoulders and back of workers. Background: Workers in the processing, refinery, and energy generation industries manually open and close <b>valves</b> with hand <b>wheels</b> that require high torque. This task is physically strenuous and can lead to shoulder musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Method: Maximum torque exertions in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions at three heights (knee, chest, and overhead) were tested. Results: The torque production in the counterclockwise (left) direction was greater than that of the clockwise (right) direction (150. 5 N·m vs. 141 N·m). This main effect was independent of valve height, as there was no interaction between direction and valve height (p =. 686). Participants exerted at least 10 % greater torque at the overhead level than at the chest level (means of 153. 2 N·m vs. 138. 3 N·m). There was no difference in maximum torque between knee and overhead levels and between knee and chest levels. Conclusion: According to ergonomics principles, the risk of MSDs affecting the shoulder and trunk from turning valves should be lowest at chest height because the postures of the shoulder and trunk are at or near neutral. However, workers exerted greatest torque when the valve was located overhead. Whether valves located at overhead height, compared with chest height, present greater risk of MSDs to workers is not known. Application: Design engineers should avoid placing hand <b>wheel</b> <b>valves</b> at knee height or lower...|$|R

The Affordance Template package stores task specifications in a robot-agnostic XML description format such that it is trivial to apply a template to a new robot.
