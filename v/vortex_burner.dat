40|$|Abstract—The paper {{reports on}} the results of {{experimental}} and numerical study of nonstationary swirling flow in an isothermal model of <b>vortex</b> <b>burner.</b> It has been identified that main source of the instability is related to a precessing vortex core (PVC) phenomenon. The PVC induced flow pulsation characteristics such as precession frequency and its variation as a function of flowrate and swirl number have been explored making use of acoustic probes. Additionally pressure transducers were used to measure the pressure drops on the working chamber and across the vortex flow. The experiments have been included also the mean velocity measurements making use of a laser-Doppler anemometry. The features of instantaneous flowfield generated by the PVC were analyzed employing a commercial CFD code (Star-CCM+) based on Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) approach. Validity of the numerical code has been checked by comparison calculated flowfield data with the obtained experimental results. It has been confirmed particularly that the CFD code applied correctly reproduces the flow features.

40|$|An LDA {{technique}} and phase averaging analysis {{were used to}} study an unsteady flow in a model <b>vortex</b> <b>burner</b> (Fig. 1 a). The flow instability originated from a precessing vortex core (PVC) associated with swirling jet breakdown. In Fig. 1 a, and based on phase averaged flow analysis for one time instant, the centre locations of the three vortex structures found are schematically represented: the PVC, helical central recirculation vortex (HCRV) and helical outer vortex (HOV). Eduction of the vortex structures was based on λ 2 -plots (Jeong and Hussain, 1995) similar to that shown in Fig. 1 b. The map displays the outer vortex arm responsible for controlling fluid entrainment in the outer shear layer of the jet. The inner spiral arm represents the central recirculation zone (CRZ) with a non-classical structure (the CRZ is usually axisymmetric due to time averaging of data). Based on data analysis we conclude that the PVC interacts with the helical central recirculation zone, acting as a stirrer inside it, rapidly losing energy during the interaction...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims at designing, {{developing}} and optimizing novel cyclonic vortex reactor configurations {{in the context}} of innovative technologies development for increasing the efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of energy systems. Furthermore, not depending on the specific engineering application, the thesis aims at improving our knowledge on cyclonic vortex flows, clarifying several aspects of their aerodynamic. In particular, the interaction mechanism between a jet and the vortex structure generated by jet itself and/or by cross interference process of multiple jets is investigated. The mixing process between inlet and recirculated fluid, due to the presence of a vortex flow is analyzed with the aim to identify reactor configurations for which the mixing process results maximized, strong, fast and easy to control. Mixing process rate analysis has been carried out by means of engulfment process quantification, a process that governs the mass exchange between a jet and fluid coming from the environment. Furthermore, the identification of the key parameters and the assesment of their effects on the cyclonic vortex structure in terms of vortex characterization and stabilization have been performed. MILD Combustion and Solar Thermal Gasification are the technologies investigated in this thesis. Cyclonic flows can be naturally coupled with such a processes due to peculiar characteristics. The first study is related {{to the development of a}} novel <b>Vortex</b> <b>burner</b> configuration for a MILD post-combustion process for the purification of CO 2 -rich exhaust streams from non-condensable reactive species {{in the context of}} Carbon-Capture and Storage Technologies (CCS). The process requires strong and fast mixing of fuel and oxidant to be stabilized and it is characterized by kinetic times longer than a conventional combustion process. The proposed configuration matches with all these constrains. Furthermore, with the configuration proposed, the cyclonic vortex is characterized by a quasi 2 D fluid-dynamic structure, so that the scale up/down of the <b>vortex</b> <b>burner</b> can be easily performed. Vortex structure characterization and the mixing process analysis have been performed by means of Particle Image Velocimetry and a CFD analysis with RANS approach. The effect of the inlet jet Reynolds number, number of inlet jets, jet type, level of confinement and total inlet flow rate on the engulfment process has been assessed. Results highlighted that the engulfment process is enhanced by increasing the inlet jet Reynolds number and the number of inlet jets, by adopting low level of confinement and an off-set wall jet. The second study investigates the use of a cyclonic flow to couple Lean Premixed (LP) and MILD Combustion concepts, for gas turbine applications. This type of process need to take place in combustion chamber where the internal recirculation is significantly enhanced to yield a high level of mixing and subsequent heating of the fresh air-fuel by means of recirculated hot products. Strong and fast mixing of inlet fluid with the hot products is necessary for stabilizing lean and ultra-lean mixture in MILD conditions and represents the critical point for the successful application of this concept to LP gas turbines. The novel vortex reactor configuration proposed allows to analyze some key aspects of mixing process in a vortex combustor. In particular, the effects of inlet jet Reynolds number, number and position of inlet jets are investigated by means of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach with the aim to analyze the mixing process between inlet and recirculated fluid. The reactor configuration proposed ensures intense, fast and stable engulfment process. Results highlighted that the engulfment process is enhanced for a jet that interacts with a vortex structure with respect to a free jet, due to an increase of the local vorticity. Furthermore, it has been found that a strong/stable mixing is achieved for a vortex reactor configuration with two or four inlet jets meanwhile a not stable mixing and a not stable vortex structure is obtained for one single inlet reactor configuration. Also the presence of fluid-dynamic flow instabilities such as Precessing Vortex Core (PVC) phenomena, generally connected with a strong 3 D cyclonic vortex structure has been investigated. Results showed that with the proposed reactor configuration, characterized by a H/dreactor < 1 and a sudden contraction as outlet section, a stable quasi 2 D vortex structure is obtained, so that PVC is avoided. Finally, the third study concerns the development of a novel Solar Vortex Gasifier (SVG) configuration. In a directly irradiated solar gasifier, the reactor window is a critical part being used to control the atmosphere in the reactor and prevent particles egress from it. The window can be subjected to overheating due to particles deposition, leading to a reduction in the solar power absorption (decreased transparency) and potential failure. The second issue that needs to be addressed is the short residence time of the particles within the SVG. The effectiveness of this reactor concept can be increased by increasing the residence time of the gas. This prolonged resident time of the particles in the reactor can be achieve by either reducing the inlet volumetric flow rate or generating stronger vortices that keep the particles in the reactor for a longer time. In a conventional SVG configuration, residence time distribution (RTD) of the particles are principally related to the main flow rate, and it is not easy to control. For a successful application of this process is mandatory that RTD results a function of other parameters, principally the particle size and that it can be easily controlled. In this view, a novel design of a solar vortex gasifier is proposed in order to develop an efficiently and flexible reactor in which at the same time the window appears clear, long particles residence time can be obtained and the particle RTD results a function of the particle size. To address this scope, a CFD Analysis has been performed with RANS approach coupled with a Lagrangian particle tracking in order to evaluate the effects of changing key parameters, namely geometrical factors, total flow rate and particle size, on window state, mean residence time and the residence time distribution of solid particles...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a numerical setup to simulate swirling jet flow undergoing vortex breakdown. Our simulation code CONCYL solves the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates using high-order numerical schemes. A nozzle {{is included in}} the computational domain to account for more realistic inflow boundary conditions. Preliminary results of a Re = 5000 compressible swirling jet at Mach number Ma = 0. 6 with an azimuthal velocity as high as the maximum axial velocity (swirl number S = 1. 0) capture the fundamental characteristics of this flow type: At a certain point in time the jet spreads and develops into a conical vortex breakdown. A stagnation point-flow {{in the vicinity of the}} jet axis is clearly visible with the stagnation point located close to the nozzle exit. The stagnation point precesses in time around the jet axis, moving up- and downstream. c © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1 Simulation methodology Swirling jets undergoing vortex breakdown occur in many technical applications, e. g. <b>vortex</b> <b>burners,</b> turbines and jet engines. At the stage of vortex breakdown the flow is dominated by a conical shear layer and a large recirculation zone around the jet axis. In our group we {{developed a}} numerical tool to investigate swirling jet flow undergoing vortex breakdown (see [1] and references therein). For spatial derivatives we use high-order finite difference schemes [2] and a spectral method. The time integration scheme is a LDDRK method of fourth order [3].

40|$|International audienceAbstract: Interactions of {{vortices}} and flame fronts may {{be considered}} as the basic structural elements of turbulent combustion. Additionally, they {{play an important role}} in flame instabilities as well as extinction and ignition processes. An ideal geometry to study these interactions is the counterflow diffusion burner with an additional actuator-driven nozzle for the generation of a <b>vortex</b> ring. This <b>burner</b> has already been well-characterized by other methods including CARS, LDA and PLIF We present first quantitative measurements of minor species concentration in this flame using a short-pulse laser and time- and spatially resolved fluorescence detection with a streak camera. Quench-ft re OH concentrations are obtained by analysis of the time-resolved profiles. The high power density of the laser pulses allowed linewise detection of hydrogen using a three-photon excitation scheme. Simultaneously, shape and position of the vortex was monitored using two-dimensional detection of flame emissions. Spatially resolved concentration profiles of H and OH are presented for different interaction heights and times in the vortex. For steady flames, comparisons with model calculations are shown...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{interaction}} of heat release by chemical reaction {{and the flow}} dominates flame transition in swirling flows caused by Combustion Induced Vortex Breakdown (CIVB). The simultaneous application of 1 kHz high speed Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) {{for the analysis of}} the flow field and OH Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) for the detection of the flame front is particularly useful for the improvement of the understanding of the observed fast CIVB driven flame propagation. For the first time, the combination of both techniques was successfully applied to confined swirling flows. In the study, the flow field characteristics of an aerodynamically stabilized burner system with CIVB are analyzed in great depth. The influence of geometric parameters of the swirl generator was investigated and conclusions concerning the proper <b>burner</b> design of <b>vortex</b> breakdown premix <b>burners</b> are drawn from the experimental results. In particular, the effect of the vortex core with respect to the stability of the swirl stabilized burner is analyzed. The contribution of combustion to vortex breakdown is shown comparing isothermal and reacting flows. Flame stability as well as the vortex core precession are discussed. The presented data reveals that at the onset of CIVB driven flame transition the azimuthal vorticity leads to the formation of a closed recirculation bubble {{at the tip of the}} internal recirculation zone. Once this bubble propagates upstream, the flame is able to follow and to propagate relative to the bulk flow velocity with a velocity far beyond the turbulent flam...|$|R
40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is {{a method}} to numerically pre- dict flow patterns. In this thesis the method is used to predict the flow in a {{hydrochloric}} acid regeneration plant located at SSAB EMEA in Borl ̈ange and to investigate the flow in a burner region of a rotary kiln at LKAB in Kiruna. The {{first part of the}} thesis concerns the topic of waste hydrochlo- ric acid (HCl) from the pickling process at SSAB. The waste acid is regenerated using a technique called spray roasting where waste HCl is sprayed into a hot reactor through four spray nozzles {{at the top of the}} reactor. The regeneration (drying) process is driven by four natu- ral gas burners placed symmetrically along the periphery of the reactor and causes the water in the waste acid droplets to evaporate. Through chemical reactions the iron chloride is oxidized to form hematite and chloride gas; the latter to be used for manufacturing of new HCl which is used in the pickling process. The byproduct in form of hematite is sold and used in e. g. the electronic industry and as filling material for road constructions. Good quality hematite powder enables profitable sale of the product, and hence an enhanced economy for the whole regenera- tion process which in turn motivates continued regeneration rather than shipping away the waste acid and continually buying new HCl. Due to the hostile environment inside the reactor, measurements and optical visualizations are difficult to perform. This constraint leads to poor understanding of the dynamics inside the reactor, since the process is a black box where waste acid is injected and hematite and chloride gas are collected; what happens between the two stages is not adequately known. Here CFD is a useful tool for the modeling of the physics inside the reactor. In this thesis, the flow inside the reactor is resolved and modeled, leading to improved understanding of the regeneration process. Also, a purely numerical approach is considered where the impact of the wall-grid resolution on the bulk flow is investigated. The second part of the thesis deals with the aerodynamics in a rotary kiln, which is a large rotating oven used in the mining industry for drying purposes. At one end of the kiln a large diffusion flame is placed in order to support the process with heat so that moisture from the material can be evaporated. The flame is fed with secondary air to achieve complete combustion. Traditionally the flame is controlled and stabilized by cre- ating a short and intense combustion zone by feeding just sufficient air for complete combustion. In the kiln used in this project, the material is sensitive to shock drying and uses oxygen to complete the oxidization stage. Hence more secondary air than what is needed for combustion is fed through the secondary air channels, making the flame longer and harder to control. Earlier research of the process has been focused on the cold flow from the secondary channels and has found a possible problem related to vortex shedding in the burner region. In this work the burner is inserted into a water model from the earlier work and PIV/PLIF mea- surements are performed to see concentration fields of the burner fluid. Numerical work is also performed in order to study the details of the <b>vortex</b> shedding and <b>burner</b> interaction. Careful validation is performed with experimental data from two interesting cases, the square cylinder and free jet, before the two models are combined to see the effect of vor- tex shedding on the mixing of the jet and secondary air. In analyzing the results of the vortex shedding and centerline concentration, dynamic mode decomposition is used to find the predominant structures of the system. In this thesis, the CFD software Ansys CFX has been used, which is commercially available, as well as the open source project OpenFOAM. Godkänd; 2015; 20150911 (simjoh...|$|R
