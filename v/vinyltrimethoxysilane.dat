50|$|Some {{mixtures}} containing peroxides and polymerizable monomers {{may also}} exhibit SADTs. For example, mixtures of <b>vinyltrimethoxysilane,</b> peroxides and stabilizers are used commercially for cross-linking polyethylene to make PEX pipe. These mixtures are typically liquid solutions that are shipped {{to where they}} are used to graft alkoxysilane groups to polyethylene. In such mixtures decomposition of the peroxide can initiate exothermic radical polymerization of the <b>vinyltrimethoxysilane.</b> At low temperature the decomposition rate is slow enough that the stabilizers quench the polymerization before much heat is generated and the container dissipates what heat is produced. At higher temperatures peroxide decomposition is faster, more polymerization occurs to heat the mixture, which in turn increases peroxide decomposition and polymerizes the monomer even faster. The container dissipates heat more slowly in a higher-temperature environment, so at some critical temperature heat is generated by polymerization faster than the container can dissipate it and the reaction self-accelerates. Thus such a mixture has a SADT that depends on container size exactly {{as in the case of}} a pure organic peroxide.|$|E

Block copolymer-templated and surface-modified magneto-dielectric nanoparticles were utilized because of their ability of uniform dispersion and ordering within the polymer matrices. The influence of intrinsic chemical composition and characteristic lengths (shape and size) of the doped nanoparticles on the resultant composites' magneto-dielectric properties was investigated. Well-dispersed high-dielectric-permittivity titanium dioxide nanoparticles were synthesized utilizing a block copolymer as a template. The nanoparticles were confined within microphase separated domains of sulfonated styrene-b-(ethylene-ran-butylene) -b-styrene block copolymers. A crosslinker (<b>vinyltrimethoxysilane)</b> was incorporated into the block copolymer matrices in order to decrease the dielectric loss from the free sulfonic acid groups. Dynamic mechanical analysis experiments confirmed that nanoparticles and crosslinker were confined within the crosslinked sulfonated styrene blocks and had no effect on the chain relaxation behavior of [ethylene-ran-butylene] blocks. Dielectric experiments showed that higher dielectric permittivity composites can thus be obtained with a significant decrease in loss tan delta (< 0. 01) when crosslinked with <b>vinyltrimethoxysilane.</b> Surfactant-modified iron oxide and nickel zinc ferrite nanoparticles of various sizes were successfully synthesized by a seed-mediated growth method. The nucleation and growth of surface-modified nanoparticles was controlled by changing the concentration ratio of surfactant to iron-precursor. The free iron ions present during synthesis are the major factor contributing to the growth of larger particles. The dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the resultant block copolymer (styrene-b-ethylene/butylene-b-styrene, SEBS) nanocomposites increased with increasing amount of doped nanoparticles. However, nickel zinc ferrite polymer composites exhibited lower dielectric loss compared to iron oxide composites due to the high electrical conductivity of iron oxide particles.

The thermal treatment significantly decreased the storage modulus close to 130  °C (the melting temperature of plastic). Thermal-treated wood veneer maintains mechanical interlocking for bonding and veneer strength which then declined under thermal treatment due to hemicellulose degradation and cellulose de-polymerization. In the silane-treated PBWC, enhanced interlocking and a stronger bonding structure resulted from the reaction between the silane-treated veneer and HDPE. This strong bonding structure allowed thermal stability improvement demonstrated by high modulus and low tanδ values.

As the DBTL amount was larger than 0. 02 phr, local crosslinking proceeds in the extruder at the time of extrusion, results in great deterioration of the products. The selected components used in the formulation are HDPE grade HB 6200, <b>vinyltrimethoxysilane</b> (VTMO) as the crosslinking agent, dicumyl peroxide (DCP) as the initiator, dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTL) as the condensation catalyst and Irganox 1010 as the antioxidant. The blow molded bottle properties and processability of the compound depends on the formulation and process parameter. Permeation rate of the fuel decreased proportionally with the addition of EVOH in PE structures. By taking the minimum rate of 1. 14 gram petrol/day, it has clearly stated that the wall layer complies the EPA emissions regulations saying that a vehicle must emit no more than a total of 2. 0 gram of hydrocarbon; measured during the diurnal (24 hours) cycle. Also when using diesel as fuel, implementing EVOH content of 1...|$|E
30|$|Mn 2 O 3 {{nanoparticles}} were synthesized by {{thermal decomposition}} of manganese oxalate nanorods [32]. For {{the synthesis of}} core-shell nanostructures with silica shell, Mn 2 O 3 nanoparticles were dispersed in Tergitol/cyclohexane mixture. Silica coating was carried out using hydrolysis of TEOS with ammonia. Amino-functionalized core-shell nanostructures Mn 2 O 3 nanoparticles were dispersed in Tergitol/ 1 -octanol/cyclohexane mixture followed by hydrolysis of 3 -APTMS using ammonia and water. Vinyl- and allyl-functionalized core-shell nanostructures were synthesized by dispersing Mn 2 O 3 nanoparticles in Tergitol/water system. The functionalized silica shell was grown over the Mn 2 O 3 nanoparticles by hydrolysis of <b>vinyltrimethoxysilane</b> and allyltrimethoxysilane using ammonia. In order {{to confirm that the}} above methodology ensures more functional groups on the core-shell, Mn 2 O 3 @amino-functionalized silica core-shell nanostructures were also synthesized by the post-grafting method wherein Mn 2 O 3 nanoparticles were dispersed in Tergitol/ 1 -octanol/cyclohexane mixture. Mn 2 O 3 nanoparticles were coated with silica using TEOS as the shell forming agent followed by addition of 3 -APTMS. Amount of amino groups on the core-shell nanostructures with amino-functionalized silica (with and without TEOS) was calculated using fluorescamine dye.|$|E
40|$|In {{preparation}} of inorganic particles filled polymer membranes, coupling agents {{can help to}} improve the compatibility between inorganic filler and polymer matrix. In this paper, surface modification of silicalite- 1 was performed by a coupling agent, <b>vinyltrimethoxysilane</b> (VTMS), and hybrid pervaporation membranes were prepared by incorporating the unmodified or VTMS-modified silicalite- 1 into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The VTMS-modified silicalite- 1 particles and hybrid membranes were characterized by FT-IR, (29) Si CP MAS NMR, DSC, TGA, XRD and SEM. The {{results showed that the}} coupling agent VTMS was readily grafted on the surface of silicalite- 1 by hydrolysis reaction and condensation reaction, and the chemical linking between the -CH=CH(2) group on the surface-modified silicalite- 1 and -Si-H on the PDMS substantially eliminated the nonselective voids inside the membrane. When used to separate acetone, butanol, ethanol (ABE) from aqueous solution, a higher selectivity was obtained with the VTMS-modified silicalite- 1 /PDMS hybrid membrane. Moreover, the surface modification of silicalite- 1 improved its dispersion in PDMS and increased the maximal loading of silicalite- 1 in membrane preparation, and thus further enhanced the separation factor of the membrane.

40|$|Tailored nanostructured ORMOSIL particles, of {{raspberry}} shaped, hollow, and rattle type structures, {{were prepared}} by a selective dissolution of siloxane networks in composite ORMOSIL particles with a multilayered structure. The synthesis of monodisperse ORMOSIL particles involved a one-pot process {{in an aqueous}} solution using a binary or ternary mixture from three organosilanes, (3 -aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APTMS), <b>vinyltrimethoxysilane</b> (VTMS), and/or phenyltrimethoxysilane (PTMS). In the following step, ORMOSIL particles were treated {{with a mixture of}} water and alcohol with mild heating. This mild etching process was efficient to selectively dissolve some of organosilane functional groups within the ORMOSIL particles but not their main silica frameworks, leading to formation of mesoporous particles. The strategy developed in this study is not only very facile, economical, and less time-consuming, but also more environmentally friendly by avoiding the use of corrosive etching chemicals and harsh reaction conditions. Surface roughness, core diameter, and shell thickness of the resultant mesoporous ORMOSIL particles were controlled by manipulating synthetic parameters such as the relative ratios of the silane monomers as well as the dissolution parameters such as temperature and type of solvent.
