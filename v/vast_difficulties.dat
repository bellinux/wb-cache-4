I reiterate that the majority should rule. If I adopt a wrong policy, the opportunity for condemnation will occur in four years' time. Then I can be turned out, and a better man with better views put in my place.|$|E
40|$|Africa has {{during the}} past decades {{experienced}} <b>vast</b> <b>difficulties</b> in inducing greater levels of economic growth, {{which in turn has}} stirred intensive debates in an attempt to unveil its causes. A dawning debate to surface during recent years places corruption as a potent obstacle to impede and dent African economic progress. Embracing a theoretical and regression analysis, this thesis sets out to unravel the causes of African corruption, its implications, and its effects upon the economic standards of a number of selected countries. The findings reveal that corruption, amid all time-periods analyzed, discloses a strong deleterious impact upon GNI per capita primarily by damaging and undermining the African insti-tutional framework, which in turn is unable to function optimally. The outcome is that less economic progress [and thus lower levels of income] is being generated as resources are allocated and squandered in a non-optimal way. It is also substantiated that Protestantism and a high degree of homogeneity are factors that exercise a positive influence upon corruption and economic standards. The thesis finally illuminates the intricate and ubiquitous impediments that obscure Africa’s economic progress. It is concluded that inept governments and institutions too often lie {{at the core of the}} quandary. The current standard of Africa’s governments and institutions thus often leave much to be desired...|$|E

5000|$|Gordon {{arrived in}} Khartoum on 18 February, and {{immediately}} became apprised of the <b>vast</b> <b>difficulty</b> of the task. Egypt's garrisons were scattered widely across the country; three—Sennar, Tokar and Sinkat—were under siege, {{and the majority}} of the territory between them was {{under the control of the}} Mahdi. There was no guarantee that, if the garrisons were to sortie, even with the clear intention of withdrawing, they would not be cut to pieces by the Mahdist forces. Khartoum's Egyptian and European population was greater than all the other garrisons combined, including 7,000 Egyptian troops [...] and 27,000 civilians and the staffs of several embassies. Although the pragmatic approach would have been to secure the safety of the Khartoum garrison and abandon the outlying fortifications and their troops to the Mahdi, Gordon became increasingly reluctant to leave the Sudan until [...] "every one who wants to go down Nile is given the chance to do so," [...] feeling it would be a slight on his honour to abandon any Egyptian soldiers to the Mahdi. He also became increasingly fearful of the Mahdi's potential to cause trouble in Egypt if allowed control of the Sudan, leading to a conviction that the Mahdi must be [...] "crushed," [...] by British troops if necessary, to assure the stability of the region. It is debated whether or not Gordon deliberately remained in Khartoum longer than strategically sensible, seemingly intent on becoming besieged within the town. Gordon's brother, H. W. Gordon, was of the opinion that the British officers could easily have escaped from Khartoum up until 14 December 1884.|$|R
5000|$|Because of the <b>vast</b> <b>difficulty</b> {{and extreme}} danger that came along with {{handling}} Special Atomic Demolition Munitions, the extreme versions of transportation {{needed for the}} tactical nuclear weapon, and the stealth-like, perfect {{manner in which the}} missions must be executed, Green Light Teams are comparable to the Japanese kamikaze pilots. [...] The general thought of many of the members of these Green Light Teams was that these missions were near suicidal. [...] One Green Light Team member, Louis Frank Napoli, said of the missions, [...] "We were kamikaze pilots without the airplanes", in reference to the heightened danger that they present. [...] Another Green Light Team member, Robert Deifel, also said of the missions, [...] "There was no room for error… We had to be absolutely perfect". The risk was extremely prevalent when discussing the possible time frame for when these atomic devices could ignite on a mechanical timer. This timer would become less efficient and more risky the longer the duration of the timer was set. The team members had been informed that the timers could go off up to eight minutes earlier than desired and even thirteen minutes after expected. [...] This would obviously create a time crisis for the Green Light team members operating the mission. If the team members were instructed to bury the nuclear device, they certainly may have been able to evade the explosion, but radioactive fallout could still cause heavy damage. [...] These missions were highly dangerous and the Green Light Team members understood the possibility of a [...] "suicide" [...] mission.|$|R
40|$|Conveyor {{transfer}} stations play a {{key role}} in many industries that handle bulk materials. Transfer stations can be rather sensitive to changes in material properties and can lead to relentless problems regarding reliability, wear, bottlenecking and blockages. Wet and sticky ores are typically difficult to handle materials due to their obnoxious ability to form a cohesive arch, adhere to surfaces and poor flow ability. Mines that are situated in areas with seasonal high rainfalls or that have started to exploit newer and more difficult to mine and handle ores, often from below the water table, experience <b>vast</b> <b>difficulty</b> in reliably conveying and processing bulk material with such diverse flow ability over time. Mining and processing operations which add water into bulk solids for processing purposes also may experience handling issues further along the handling and processing line. Cohesive and adhesive effects of wet, sticky ore on transfer stations which contain impact plates, ledges and curved or straight chutes can make it difficult to design a system to reliably guide material in the direction of the receiving belt. Therefore, the usage of the discrete element method (DEM) to model the flow of cohesive and cohesionless materials through industrial transfer stations is increasing. This paper gives a short overview of the implementation of DEM to trouble-shoot and optimise a transfer station and shed some light on the strength and weaknesses of DEM. Some of the vital calibration techniques used to 2 ̆ 7 tune 2 ̆ 7 the DEM material model using numerous bench-scale tests to produce representative flow behaviour of wet, sticky ores is also discussed...|$|R

60|$|Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,--It must be {{a matter}} of sincere {{satisfaction}} to those who, like myself, have for many years past been convinced of the vital importance of technical education to this country to see that that subject is now being taken up by {{some of the most important}} of our manufacturing towns. The evidence which is afforded of the public interest in the matter by such meetings as those at Liverpool and Newcastle, and, last but not least, by that at which I have the honour to be present to-day, may convince us all, I think, that the question has passed out of the region of speculation into that of action. I need hardly say to any one here that the task which our Association contemplates is not only one of primary importance--I may say of vital importance--to the welfare of the country; but that it is one of great extent and of <b>vast</b> <b>difficulty.</b> There is a well-worn adage that those who set out upon a great enterprise would do well to count the cost. I am not sure that this is always true. I think that some of the very greatest enterprises in this world have been carried out successfully simply because the people who undertook them did not count the cost; and I am much of opinion that, in this very case, the most instructive consideration for us is the cost of doing nothing. But there is one thing that is perfectly certain, and it is that, in undertaking all enterprises, one of the most important conditions of success is to have a perfectly clear comprehension of what you want to do--to have that before your minds before you set out, and from that point of view to consider carefully the measures which are best adapted to the end.|$|R

40|$|Part 1 : Decision Support Systems, Intelligent Systems and Artificial Intelligence ApplicationsInternational audienceFruit {{location}} {{is an important}} parameter for apple harvesting robot to conduct picking task. However, {{it is difficult to}} obtain coordinates of each apple under natural conditions. One of the major challenges is detecting adjacent fruits accurately. Previous studies for adjacent detection have shortcomings such as <b>vast</b> computation, <b>difficulty</b> in implementation and over-segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective separating method for adjacent apples recognition based on chain code information and obtain the centroid coordinates of each fruit. Firstly, those valid regions of fruit are extracted by pre-processing the initial image. Secondly, chain code information is obtained by following the contour of extracted regions. Thirdly, through observing the changing law of chain code difference and adopting local optimum principle, concave points are found. Finally, the best point pairs are determined with different matching principles, and those adjacent apples are separated exactly. The experimental results show that the average rate of successful separation is greater than 91. 2 % with the proposed method, which can meet the requirements of applications in harvesting robots...|$|R

50|$|Ultimately, {{other sources}} of {{illumination}} {{will have to be}} put to use, such as electron beams, x-rays or similar sources of electromagnetic energy with wavelengths much shorter than visible light. However, in order to delay as long as possible the <b>vast</b> expense and <b>difficulty</b> of adopting a whole new type of illumination technology, manufacturers have turned to a technique, previously used in microscopes, for increasing the numerical aperture of the lens by allowing the light to pass through water instead of air. This method, called immersion lithography, is the current cutting edge of practical production technology. It works because numerical aperture {{is a function of the}} maximum angle of light that can enter the lens and the refractive index of the medium through which the light passes. When water is employed as the medium, it greatly increases numerical aperture, since it has a refractive index of 1.44 at 193 nm, while air has an index of 1. Current production machines employing this technology are capable of resolving lines in the 32 nm range, and may eventually be able to achieve lines of 30 nm.|$|R

The thing, of course, was discussed very much, more perhaps {{at the time of its}} discovery than during the interval of technical adaptation, but with very little realisation of the huge economic revolution that impended. What chiefly impressed the journalists of 1933 was the production of gold from bismuth and the realisation albeit upon unprofitable lines of the alchemist's dreams; there was a considerable amount of discussion and expectation in that more intelligent section of the educated publics of the various civilised countries which followed scientific development; but for the most part the world went about its business--as the inhabitants of those Swiss villages which live under the perpetual threat of overhanging rocks and mountains go about their business--just as though the possible was impossible, as though the inevitable was postponed for ever because it was delayed.|$|R
40|$|The {{computer}} analysis of structures in image sequences {{is a very}} complex and challengingmatter as it usually involves automatic tasks for detection, matching, tracking, motionanalysis, deformation estimation as well as 3 D shape reconstruction. Despite its inherentdifficulties, this computational analysis provides a wide range of important applications in oursociety such as is the case of medical diagnosis systems, surveillance systems, tools used todevelop virtual reality environments, biomechanical modeling, in addition to simulation andbioengineering systems. As a result of the extent of the purposes of this <b>vast</b> process, several <b>difficulties</b> can arise,such as is the case of the simultaneous analysis of manifold structures, cases of temporaryocclusion of the structure from the image scene or even its definitive disappearance,alterations of the viewpoints which have been taken into consideration or alternatively, of theillumination conditions, or even of the non-rigid deformations that non-rigid structures mayundergo along image sequences. In this presentation, we will provide an overview of several of the methods that we havedeveloped in order to analyze structures in image sequences; more specifically, those whichare used for the segmentation, tracking and matching of images, as well as the estimation ofthe deformation involved between images and the 3 D shape reconstruction from images. Some application examples will be presented which take into consideration medical, face,traffic and surveillance images amongst others...|$|R
40|$|The trade {{networks}} of the Roman Empire {{are among the}} most intensively researched large-scale market systems in antiquity, yet there is no consensus on the economic structure behind this <b>vast</b> network. The <b>difficulty</b> arises from data fragmentation and the lack of formal analytical methods. Here, the authors present a Bayesian analysis quantifying the extent to which four previously proposed hypotheses match the evidence for the market system in Roman olive oil. Results suggest that the size of economic agents involved in this network followed a power-law distribution, strongly indicating the presence of free market structures supplying olive oil to Rome. This new analysis offers an important tool to researchers exploring the impact of trade on the dynamics of past societies.

But {{from the outset}} I meant more than mere sexual desire, lust and lustful imaginings, more than {{personal}} reactions to beauty and spirited living, more even than what is called love. On the one hand I had in mind many appetites that are not sexual yet turn to bodily pleasure, {{and on the other}} there are elements of pride arising out of sex and passing into other regions, all the elements of rivalry for example, that have strained my first definition to the utmost. And I see now that this Second Limitation as I first imagined it spreads out without any definite boundary, to include one's rivalries with old schoolfellows, for example, one's generosities to beggars and dependents, one's desire to avenge an injured friend, one's point of honour, one's regard for the good opinion of an aunt and one's concern for the health of a pet cat. All these things may enrich, but they may also impede and limit the aristocratic scheme. I thought for a time I would call this ill-defined and miscellaneous wilderness of limitation the Personal Life. But at last I have decided to divide this <b>vast</b> territory of <b>difficulties</b> into two subdivisions and make one of these Indulgence, meaning thereby pleasurable indulgence of sense or feeling, and the other a great mass of self-regarding motives that will go with a little stretching under the heading of Jealousy. I admit motives are continually playing across the boundary of these two divisions, I should find it difficult to argue a case for my classification, but in practice these two groupings have a quite definite meaning for me. There is pride in the latter group of impulses and not in the former; the former are always a little apologetic. Fear, Indulgence, Jealousy, these are the First Three Limitations of the soul of man. And the greatest of these is Jealousy, because it can use pride. Over them the Life Aristocratic, as I conceive it, marches to its end. It saves itself for the truth rather than sacrifices itself romantically for a friend. It justifies vivisection if thereby knowledge is won for ever. It upholds that Brutus who killed his sons. It forbids devotion to women, courts of love and all such decay of the chivalrous idea. And it resigns--so many things that no common Man of Spirit will resign. Its intention transcends these things. Over all the world it would maintain justice, order, a noble peace, and it would do this without indignation, without resentment, without mawkish tenderness or individualized enthusiasm or any queen of beauty. It is of a cold austere quality, commanding sometimes admiration but having small hold upon the affections of men. So that it is among its foremost distinctions that its heart is steeled...." ...|$|R
