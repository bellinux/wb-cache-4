50|$|The figure {{shows an}} op-amp clamp circuit with a non-zero {{reference}} clamping voltage. The advantage {{here is that}} the clamping level is at precisely the reference voltage. There is no need {{to take into account the}} forward <b>volt</b> <b>drop</b> of the diode (which is necessary in the preceding simple circuits as this adds to the reference voltage). The effect of the diode <b>volt</b> <b>drop</b> on the circuit output will be divided down by the gain of the amplifier, resulting in an insignificant error. The circuit also has a great improvement in linearity at small input signals in comparison to the simple diode circuit.|$|E
5000|$|To {{overcome}} {{the problems of}} these undesirable resistances (known as 'parasitic resistance'), very low value resistors and particularly precision resistors and high current ammeter shunts are constructed as four terminal resistors. These resistances have a pair of current terminals {{and a pair of}} potential or voltage terminals. In use, a current is passed between the current terminals, but the <b>volt</b> <b>drop</b> across the resistor is measured at the potential terminals. The <b>volt</b> <b>drop</b> measured will be entirely due to the resistor itself as the parasitic resistance of the leads carrying the current to and from the resistor are not included in the potential circuit. To measure such resistances, requires a bridge circuit designed to work with four terminal resistances. That bridge is the Kelvin bridge.|$|E
5000|$|The {{overdrive}} {{is produced}} using two silicon diodes in anti-parallel arrangement into the negative feedback circuit of a operational amplifier ("op-amp") circuit, to produce soft, symmetrical {{distortion of the}} input waveform. When the output exceeds the forward <b>volt</b> <b>drop</b> of the diodes the amplifier gain is much lower, effectively limiting the output to + and - one diode volt-drop, although due to the exponential I-V curve of the diodes {{this is not a}} hard limit. A [...] "drive" [...] potentiomenter in the feedback path provides variable gain. The original 4558 based circuit uses transistor buffers at both the input and the output, to improve impedance matching. This is mathematically equivalent to mixing the input signal with a clipped version of itself, however. Thought of this way, it is said that this [...] "preserves the original dynamics of the input signal which otherwise would get lost at the threshold of clipping" [...] and [...] "avoids muddiness and vastly improves clarity and responsiveness." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{open-circuit}} voltage is 1.4 <b>volts,</b> <b>dropping</b> to 1.2 <b>volts</b> during discharge. The electrolyte mixture of potassium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide is not consumed in charging or discharging, so unlike a lead-acid battery the electrolyte specific gravity {{does not indicate}} state of charge. [...] The voltage required to charge the Ni-Fe battery is {{equal to or greater}} than 1.6 volts per cell. [...] Lithium hydroxide improves the performance of the cell. The equalization charge voltage is 1.65 volts.|$|R
2500|$|The {{terminal}} voltage across an operating lamp {{varies depending on}} the arc current, tube diameter, temperature, and fill gas. A fixed part of the voltage drop {{is due to the}} electrodes. [...] A general lighting service [...] T12 lamp operates at 430mA, with 100 <b>volts</b> <b>drop.</b> High output lamps operate at 800 mA, and some types operate up to 1.5A. The power level varies from 33 to 82 watts per meter of tube length (10 to 25 W/ft) for T12 lamps.|$|R

40|$|This work {{deals with}} direct-current {{electric}} motor, type P 2 XR 49, by firm ATAS elektromotory Nachod a. s. At first {{there is an}} introduction with the principal of running, starting, controlling of revolutions and commutating of direct-current machine. The implementation of direct-current machines contains a construction {{and a list of}} machine parts, a type of winding and types of small motors that had been used. It is ordered according to a type of excitation. The work includes detailed procedure of admeasurements of speed-torque characteristic mostly used in practice. There is a large number of machine characteristics. The speed-torque characteristic was measured in constant voltage rating into current rating in the direction of rotation CCW upwardly and CW on strength of current rating. Machine innovation, decrease in <b>volt</b> <b>drop</b> on the commutator, was chosen because commutator is the most problematic part of the machine. If the contact pressure is increased the transition resistance will be lesser and consequently the <b>volt</b> <b>drop</b> on the commutator will be lesser...|$|E
40|$|The {{filter and}} {{controller}} {{design for a}} grid connected inverter is a challenging balance between size, cost and complexity with various standard harmonic requirements. Unfortunately, while LCL filters provide exceptional PWM frequency filtering they tend to generate significant baseband harmonics. This paper presents an analytical explanation as to why low per-unit filters, specifically LCL filters, generate more baseband harmonic distortion than a conventional L filter. Firstly it identifies that both grid distortion and baseband distortion created by deadtime and device <b>volt</b> <b>drop</b> contribute similar magnitudes of harmonic voltage, and hence potentially reinforce one another to drive harmonic currents into the grid. Next it is shown how the lower total inductance of an LCL filter significantly reduces its baseband impedance, generating more harmonic currents for a given level of voltage distortion. This outcome is further exacerbated by a reduced allowable controller bandwidth due to the LCL resonance. Consequently the paper proposes that feedback harmonic compensators are the best practical option for mitigation of both grid and converter baseband harmonic current distortion. The analysis is verified by simulation and experimental results...|$|E
5000|$|Traction power {{networks}} routinely operate {{well above}} the nominal voltage, but still within the tolerance. For example, a streetcar traction power could be rated 600 Â±10% volts nominal, but the actual overhead line voltage would normally be close to 660 <b>volts,</b> only <b>dropping</b> near the nominal value in exceptional conditions.|$|R
50|$|The diode-wired MOSFET {{version of}} the Dickson {{multiplier}} does not work very well at very low voltages {{because of the large}} drain-source <b>volt</b> <b>drops</b> of the MOSFETs. Frequently, a more complex circuit is used to overcome this problem. One solution is to connect in parallel with the switching MOSFET another MOSFET biased into its linear region. This second MOSFET has a lower drain-source voltage than the switching MOSFET would have on its own (because the switching MOSFET is driven hard on) and consequently the output voltage is increased. The gate of the linear biased MOSFET is connected to the output of the next stage so that it is turned off while the next stage is charging from the previous stage's capacitor. That is, the linear-biased transistor is turned off {{at the same time as}} the switching transistor.|$|R
40|$|Master of Science in Engineering - EngineeringAn {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} the failures of 88 kV line surge arrestors at an Eskom Distribution substation. The surge arrestor failed when one phase of the transmission line was open circuited and all three phases were not isolated by the protection relays. The transformer was lightly loaded and a surge arrestor blocked the neutral path to the ground. The investigation used a modified version of an equivalent circuit proposed by Marti [1]. Transformer magnetising losses, the non-linear resistance of the neutral surge arrestor and the transformer magnetising reactance of the closed-circuit phases were all included. The investigation revealed that the failure of the arrestor was due to the combined <b>volt</b> <b>drops</b> across the open circuited phase of the transformer magnetising reactance and the neutral surge arrestor. A resonance condition lowered the magnetising reactance of the open circuited phase of the transformer and forced the transformer into saturation. This resonance is characteristic of the fundamental frequency ferroresonance condition [2]...|$|R
40|$|Fretting {{is known}} to be a major cause of contact {{deterioration}} and failure in connector systems. During fretting the contact resistance generally increases slowly with time. Superimposed on this slow increase in contact resistance are rapid changes in contact resistance within fractions of a second, called intermittences or short duration discontinuities. Consideration is given to the evaluation of surface wear during the fretting process using a 3 D laser scanner. The surface wear of both plated and solid surfaces are related to the frequency of the intermittency events. High speed measurements of contact voltage drop and contact current have been carried out and the results are evaluated using general contact theory. It is shown that sudden changes in contact resistance can be caused by the interaction of surface films and metallic contact combined with the melting of current carrying asperities. The latter phenomena also accounting for <b>volt</b> <b>drops</b> across the contact interface which exceed the melting voltage of the material...|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{the forward}} voltage of an LED is between 1.8 and 3.3 volts. It varies {{by the color}} of the LED. A red LED {{typically}} <b>drops</b> 1.8 <b>volts,</b> but voltage <b>drop</b> normally rises as the light frequency increases, so a blue LED may drop from 3 to 3.3 volts.|$|R

The vehicle also has a regenerative braking system. The electrical power from the generator is sent primarily to the electric motor, with the excess going to the batteries, depending {{on the state of}} charge (SOC) of the battery pack and the power demanded at the wheels.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} how the condition of zero current on open flux tubes with polar wind outflow, subjected to large photoelectron fluxes, can be achieved. We employ a steady state collisionless semikinetic model to determine the density profiles of O(+), H(+), thermal electrons and photoelectrons coming from the ionosphere along with H(+), ions and electrons coming from the magnetosphere. The model solution attains a potential distribution which both satisfies the condition of charge neutrality and zero current. For the range of parameters considered in {{this study we}} find that a 45 - 60 <b>volt</b> discontinuous potential <b>drop</b> may develop to reflect most of the photoelectrons back toward the ionosphere. This develops because the downward flux of electrons from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere on typical open flux tubes (e. g. the polar rain) appears to be insufficient to balance the photoelectron flux from the ionosphere...|$|R
40|$|During the {{previous}} year, grant activity research focused on demonstrating high thrust/power operation of Hall thrusters. Performance {{of a low}} power and a high power Hall thruster was experimentally investigated at discharge voltages from 100 to 150 <b>volts.</b> Discharge efficiencies <b>dropped</b> significantly as discharge voltage was decreased over this range. Reductions in discharge efficiency with decreasing discharge voltage were attributed to reductions in ionization efficiency and/or ion acceleration through a potential less that the applied discharge voltage relative {{to the performance of}} state-of-art Hall thrusters operating at discharge voltages of 300 Volts and above. The low power Hall thruster exhibited a more pronounced reduction in discharge efficiency with decreasing discharge voltage. This was attributed to increased electron leakage related to the axial distribution of the radial magnetic field. These data demonstrated that the thrust benefit of operating at discharge voltages below 130 Volts was offset by a corresponding decrease in discharge efficiency for a given input power. Additional activities included continued support of on-going Hall thruster propulsion research within the On-Board Propulsion Branch at NASA Glenn Research Center...|$|R
40|$|Electrical system Tadulako University has {{problems}} voltage drop and load unbalance {{caused by the}} distance network connecting the distribution substation and the supplied building is so far. Moreover, the load distribution is irregular resulting in drop voltage and load imbalance. This study is specifically addressed to discuss the problems occurred in Gardu Selatan Universitas Tadulako, where the substation is supplying the load to the Fakultas Pertanian, Fakultas Kehutanan, Fakultas Teknik, Fakultas MIPA, FKIK, and several other new buildings. The method used is to measure the current and voltage on the transformer and also on the panels in the building who experience a voltage drop by using Amperes pliers. The results of the measurements and analysis are that the 185 <b>Volt</b> low voltage <b>drop</b> has passed the standard provisions PUIL where the voltage drop across the low voltage network is 4 %. This is because the area supplied by the substation south very wide and long enough network that reaches 804 meters so far has exceeded the provision SPLN maximum of 350 meters. It is therefore necessary to transfer electricity network path between distribution substations closer to the buildings in the supply. To avoid load unbalance it is necessary precision in any additional load on each phase and phase transfer loads to smaller current values ââmeasured during peak load...|$|R
