50|$|The <b>voice</b> <b>switching</b> fabric {{plan was}} {{similar to that of the}} earlier 5XB switch in being {{bidirectional}} and in using the call-back principle. The largest full access matrix switches in the system, however, were 8x8 rather than 10x10 or 20x16. Thus they required eight stages rather than four to achieve large enough junctor groups in a large office. Crosspoints being more expensive in the new system but switches cheaper, system cost was minimized with fewer crosspoints organized into more switches. The fabric was divided into Line Networks and Trunk Networks of four stages, and partially folded to allow connecting line-to-line or trunk-to-trunk without exceeding eight stages of switching.|$|E

Switching commands generated during the call creates necessary switch table entries in the <b>Voice</b> <b>Switching</b> Unit in the DXT. Voice frames produced in a group call in TETRA network reaches the <b>Voice</b> <b>Switching</b> Unit. The voice frames are multiplied and modified according to the participants of the group call. The modified packets are then forwarded toward the recipients. In order to provide more virtualization and avoid custom hardware, the concept of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is used in <b>voice</b> <b>switching.</b> As a result a new system is developed, which performs the exact function of the current <b>Voice</b> <b>Switching</b> Unit. Replacement of current <b>Voice</b> <b>Switching</b> Unit with a combination of a SDN controller and a COTS SDN switch allows performing the switching of voice frames of the group call. Switching commands related to the group call are processed by the SDN application and necessary entries are made inside the SDN switch. As a result when voice frames reaches the SDN switch, the switch performs the table lookups. Upon finding the matching entry, the frames are multiplied and modified according to the details of the recipients. The concept of group tables in SDN switch helps in multiplying and modifying the packets. The modified packets are then forwarded towards the recipients, making the call a success...|$|E

40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is {{currently}} {{involved in a}} tremendous effort to upgrade the nation's Air Traffic Control (ATC) system. Included in this effort is a new communications system called the <b>Voice</b> <b>Switching</b> and Control System (VSCS) for use primarily in the Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs). The critical nature of the communications system, the complex Computer Human Interface (CHI) and functionality, and technology differences from the existing communications system caused the FAA to involve an Air Traffic Controller user group early in the design process. This group of subject matter experts was intended to help ensure adequate operational testing which would help secure user acceptance when VSCS was fielded. This paper discusses the methodology developed for the operational evaluation of the prototype VSCS in the Design Competition Phase (DCP) of the program. The methodology exposed problems {{in the areas of}} specification compliance, system stability, voice quality, CHI and operational suitability beyond those identified by the formal development test program called Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT). It was discovered that individual system functions that worked properly when exercised in isolation during FAT did not always work properly when exercised in realistic operational scenarios by controllers. The comparison of results between FAT and the operational evaluations show that controller evaluations should be included throughout the development process of FAA programs, and that the methodology used plays a fundamental role in uncovering issues...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the quality of the synthetic speech and the auditory representation of documents. We introduce the language platform DEMOSTHeNES, which we exploit to design a complete Text-to-Speech (TtS) system for the Greek language featuring novel properties, like the non-standard word normalization sub-system for inflecting languages, the support of polyglot texts and different pronunciation idioms and more. In addition, starting from the text processing, we deal with the lack of text meta-data auditory rendering provision from TtS systems. The proposed script-based Document-to-Audio architecture manages to aurally represent meta-data along with the text by using synthetic speech with controlled prosodic properties, <b>voice</b> <b>switching</b> and audio insertions. Moving to the problem of synthetic prosody, we present a modeling method that utilizes enriched linguistic features during the prediction of the intontational structure and the F 0 targets in CART and linear regression models. Our approach clearly shows the improvements in F 0 surface, as the enriched features increase the correlation of the original and the synthetic curve by 19. 5 %. Furthermore, we introduce an F 0 modeling approach based on selecting abstracted tone groups. Groups are formed according to the tonal distinction of significant and functional syllables. This distinction is experimentally proved as valid by both objective and perceptual measurements. The proposed model is judged to be more natural in 75 % of the cases, when compared against a typical linear regression one. Finally, a series of psycho-acoustic evaluative experiments shows that the model achieves greater than 70. 8 % accuracy in rendering three levels of emphasis during speech synthesis. 1...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma(Technology) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1988 The project entails {{designing}} and installing an emergency fire telephone system (EFTS) for the 23 storey Cape Town Administrative Civic Centre. The original system, with its mostly analogue circuitry, has no documentation available, {{is difficult to}} maintain and has become unreliable. After considering alternative systems the most economical option was to expand the original system by adding more extension telephones and to redesign the control section. The new EFTS briefly operates as follows: The status of ninety six extension telephones, installed at the emergency exits on each floor, are displayed on a mimic status display which both operators can monitor. Any emergency call can be identified by a green flashing LED and a distinctive bleep. The LED indicates the exact position and number of the telephone in the building, Each operator has a keypad and a two digit numeric display fitted his telephone. The operator can immediately answer incoming calls by pressing the queue button. Calls queue on a {{first in first out}} basis. The number of the extension telephone will be displayed on a numeric display. The operator can also select the extension he wishes to contact, by dialling the extension number on the keypad. The EFTS consists of nine printed circuit boards. A rack mounted Microcomputer board, made up of a Motorola MC 6809 microprocessor, six 6821 PlAs, 2 kilobyte RAM, up to 16 kilobyte ROM and a watchdog timer controls the EFTS. Two Telephone Controller boards process voice signals and generate logic control signals for the CMOS <b>voice</b> <b>switching</b> circuitry on the Multiplexer Monitor boards. Six Multiplexer Monitor boards switch the two operators to any of the ninety six extension telephones and continuously monitor the extension telephone lines for faults and handset statuses. Noise and over voltage line protection is provided. The multiplexing of the 192 LEDs on the Mimic Status Display is controlled by the Microcomputer board. An unusual principle used in this design is the combination of low frequency AM and audio to affect communication. Two uninterruptable power supplies provide user independence from mains. Software used for the EFTS is written in 6809 Assembly Language. A Real time interrupt controls the Mimic Status Display. Operator actions are interfaced with the program logic by means of hardware interrupts...|$|E
