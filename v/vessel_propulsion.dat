40|$|High-frequency, {{continuous}} monitoring using in situ sensors offers a comprehensive and improved {{insight into the}} temporal and spatial variability of any water body. In this paper, we describe a 7 -month exploratory monitoring programme in Dublin Port, demonstrating the value of high frequency data in enhancing knowledge of processes, informing discrete sampling, and ultimately increasing the efficiency of port and environmental management. Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney tests were used to show that shipping operating in Dublin Port has a small–medium effect on turbidity readings collected by in situ sensors. Turbidity events are largely related to vessel activity in Dublin Port, caused by re-suspension of sediments by <b>vessel</b> <b>propulsion</b> systems. The magnitudes of such events are strongly related to water level and tidal state at vessel arrival times. Crucially, measurements of Escherichia coli and enterococci contamination from discrete samples taken at key periods related to detected turbidity events were up to nine times higher after vessel arrival than prior to disturbance. Daily in situ turbidity patterns revealed time-dependent water quality “hot spots” during a 24 -h period. We demonstrate conclusively that if representative environmental assessment of water quality is to be performed at such sites, sampling times, informed by continous monitoring data, should take into account these daily variations.

Detailed data of individual ferry vessel accidents for the 11 -year time period 1991 - 2001 that were investigated by the U. S. Coast Guard are used to estimate ferry-vessel accident property damage cost and injury severity equations. Tobit regression is used to estimate the former equation and the ordered probit model is used to estimate the latter. Property damage costs include damage costs to the vessel itself, its cargo and contents, and other-property damage (e. g., damage to pier structures and waterfront facilities). Injury severity for a ferry vessel accident is measured as an ordinal variable – no injuries, non-fatal injuries and fatal injuries. Damage cost and injury severity of individual ferry vessel accidents are expressed as functions {{of the type of}} vessel accident, vessel characteristics, vessel operation phase, weather/visibility conditions, type of waterway, type of <b>vessel</b> <b>propulsion,</b> type of vessel hull construction and cause of vessel accident.

This capstone review paper examines the environmental impacts, legislation, and current investigations of marine debris, especially derelict fishing gear, and outlines recommendations to alleviate this problem. Derelict fishing gear refers to any type of net, line, rope, trap, or buoy used in commercial fishing that has become lost or intentionally discarded. This category of marine debris may contribute significantly to the mortality of marine pinnipeds, sea turtles, seabirds, and fishes, which can become entangled or ingest the debris.

The method referred to here is that of towing (German: treideln or any number of other terms such as treilen, trekken, jagen, bomätschen, etc., depending on the region), briefly defined in the sub-title above. A detailed discussion of the term treideln is followed by the identification and evaluation of historically relevant sources. The picture credits are divided into five sections: early towing in Europe (antiquity, Middle Ages); horse-powered towing in the Netherlands (17 th - 20 th centuries) with particular regard to the transport of passengers and mail by inland waterway vessel, a method that was highly advanced in that region and attained major significance under the designation "Trekvaart"; towing in East Friesland, Germany (19 th - 20 th centuries) and its special forms: the Ems River form, inland village and "Fehn" navigation (Fehn being the term for linear settlements built along canals in the high moor areas) as well as the (short-lived) "Treckfahrt" between cities; "Die schwere Arbeit" (hard work) : reproductions of scenes from various cultures depicting towing by manpower: artistic interpretations which are often quite moving and in some cases also socio-critically expressive; several depictions of European horse-powered towing carried out in otherwise unusual dimensions.

40|$|As the {{shipping}} industry is growing, {{more and more}} propulsion systems are being developed with better propulsion capabilities. These current and newly developing systems in ships are expected to cause scour at beds around berthing structures with greater likelihood than the systems preceding them, which increases the importance of protection methods used {{to deal with this}} issue. In early 2015, the World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure (PIANC) has published a report titled ‘Guidelines for Protecting Berthing Structures from Scour Caused by Ships’ with the aim of providing practical guidelines and detailed background information about <b>vessel</b> <b>propulsion</b> systems in order to allow designers to make a proper design of the bed protection in front of the berth structures or to estimate the scour expected to develop. However, the applicability of these guidelines to real scenarios remains to be assessed. The limitations and uncertainties associated with the guidelines have been determined by applying the aforementioned guidelines to the riprap type of bed protection design of both open and solid berthing structures in an inland mooring facility located in the Rotterdam harbour. In examining these guidelines, it was revealed that several assumptions are necessary due to lack of information on various parameters and some specifications of the design ship, along with shortcomings and limitations of the methods and equations presented. The significance of these assumptions on the applicability of the guidelines has been investigated. In cases where limitations have been found, owing to assumptions or otherwise, certain solutions can be offered to overcome these. The guidelines were found to be applicable and provide decent instructions for a proper bed protection design in spite of the requirement of some assumptions. The effectiveness of the guidelines can be improved thanks to further research with bed protection designs for different case study locations and various bed protection methods to verify the conclusions reached in this study. Moreover, supplementary resources like a catalogue containing detailed information about several ship characteristics with relatively higher influences in the design process can help designers to gather more accurate data {{to be used in the}} calculations.

40|$|Modern wild-capture marine {{fisheries}} are underpinned {{by energy}} derived from fossil fuels. This energy {{is required for}} <b>vessel</b> <b>propulsion</b> and gear operation, onboard processing, freezing and refrigeration, and producing electricity for ancillary services. Fuel use is the primary driver of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from marine fisheries, and the second highest cost to fishers globally after labour. Fuel consumption has received increased attention from industry, consumers, governments, and environmental organizations in response to higher and more unpredictable energy prices {{and the need to}} reduce GHG emissions to mitigate climate change. A large and growing amount of research has been undertaken {{since the beginning of the}} 21 st century to measure, characterize, and reduce energy use and GHG emissions in fishing fleets. This thesis provides an overview of the magnitude of fuel consumption in marine wild-capture fisheries, assesses how and why fuel consumption and GHG emissions vary between vessels, fleets, and national industries, and discusses the environmental and economic implications of energy use in fisheries at global, regional, and local scales. The global-scale research here involved the synthesis and analysis of data pertaining to fuel use in fisheries. Data from all available primary and secondary sources were compiled in a global fisheries and energy use database (FEUD). Observed rates of fuel inputs to global fisheries were characterized by target species, primary gear type, and region. Fuel use rates were then used as a proxy to estimate GHG emissions from national and global fishing fleets, assess the relative emissions from different sectors of the global fishing fleet, and track emissions from the industry from 1990 to 2011. World fisheries in 2011 consumed 40 billion litres of fuel and emitted 168 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent GHGs to the atmosphere. Energy performance varied between fisheries by three orders of magnitude, with crustacean fisheries consuming vastly more fuel than fisheries targeting small pelagic forage fish. Regional-scale research applied cost and revenue data to estimate the fuel use intensity (FUI) of a range of Australian fisheries and compare environmental (emissions) and economic (costs) roles of fuel use. Australian fisheries followed similar patterns to global fisheries, with all of the more fuel-intensive fisheries targeting rock lobsters and prawns, while the more efficient fisheries targeted small pelagics. The economic role of fuel also varied markedly, although fuel costs as a percentage of fishing revenue did not consistently correlate with consumption rates. Fuel expenditures in Australian fisheries ranged from 2...|$|E
40|$|Collisions with {{ships are}} one of the leading causes of death for whales and are increasing. It is {{imperative}} to eliminate or greatly reduce whale mortality caused by ship strikes because even a few deaths may {{have a significant impact on}} severely endangered species, such as the North Atlanticright whale (Eubalaena glacialis). There are numerous proposed causes and solutions, but none that will completely eliminate the problem. New avenues must be explored. Causes include cetacean biology, as well as anthropogenic. Biology related factors that may affect collisions include species, gender, physical condition, age, activity, time of day, season, changes in food location and availability. Suggested anthropogenic causes include increases in ship traffic, ship size and speed, hull configuration, and propellers. Ocean noise is considered a multi faceted factor. Sound is the primary form of sensory perception for most cetaceans. The naturally noisy ocean is increased by anthropogenic sources of noise which have increased over the years. Of greatest concern is active sonar used by a variety of users, but of most impact are the navies around the world. The U. S. Navy has been involved in ongoing disagreements regarding their use and the detrimental effect of sonar on cetaceans. Sonar is believed to disrupt their normal behavior and hearing, making them more vulnerable to ship strikes. From the plethora of data, a “typical” whale strike can be constructed. The profile shows the following characteristics: a young fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) injured by blunt trauma likely carried into port on the bow of the ship in theMediterranean Sea. Proposed solutions include an audible whale deterrent, changes in vessel design to reduce noise, and reduction in noise producing activities. It is believed that if whales can be located, they may be avoided. Thus, solutions for locating whales include tracking whales by tagging, electronic monitoring, passive acoustic detection, active sonar, radar, and infrared detection. Changes in vessel operation include shifting shipping lanes. They also include a reduction in speed which is seen by many as one of the most viable solutions, but is not eagerly embraced by the shipping industry. Because voluntary speed reduction compliance was violated extensively, the reduction in speed became mandatory. Suggestions for further research include changes in <b>vessel</b> <b>propulsion</b> to reduce noise and injuries, changing the frequency of some shipping noise, a device to attract whales away from vessels, new sensors and software for locating whales, dual use of security sonar, use of virtual training to replace live sonar training by Navy, and relocation of more shipping lanes. Because the ocean is not a discrete entity, divided by country, there must also be an international policy solution. TheU. S. needs to ratify the U. N. Convention on the Law of the Sea in order for the country to take a leading role in international solutions. Just as there may not be a single definitive cause of whale strikes by ships, there may also not be a single solution. There may very well be a combination of several solutions.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis presents {{new ideas and}} research results on control of marine electric power system. The main motivation for this work {{is the development of}} a control system, power management system (PMS) capable to improve the system robustness to blackout, handle major power system faults, minimize the operational cost and keep the power system machinery components under minimal stress in all operational conditions. Today, the electric marine power system tends to have more system functionality implemented in integrated automation systems. The present state of the art type of tools and methods for analyzing marine power systems do only to a limited extent utilize the increased knowledge available within each of the mechanical and electrical engineering disciplines. As the propulsion system is typically consisted of the largest consumers on the vessel, important interactions exists between the PMS and <b>vessel</b> <b>propulsion</b> system. These are interacted through the dynamic positioning (DP) controller, thrust allocation algorithm, local thruster controllers, generators' local frequency and voltage controllers. The PMS interacts with the propulsion system through the following main functions: available power static load control, load rate limiting control and blackout prevention control (i. e. fast load reduction). These functions serve to prevent the blackout and to ensure that the vessel will always have enough power. The PMS interacts with other control systems in order to prevent a blackout and to minimize operational costs. The possibilities to maximize the performance of the vessel, increase the robustness to faults and decrease a component wear-out rate are mainly addressed locally for the individual control systems. The solutions are mainly implicative (for e. g. local thruster control, or DP thrust allocation), and attention has not been given on the interaction between these systems, the power system and PMS. Some of the questions that may arise regarding the system interactions, are as follows: how the PMS functionality may affect a local thruster control, how the local thruster control may affect the power system performance, how some consumers may affect the power system performance in normal operations and thus affect other consumers, how the power system operation may affect the susceptibility to faults and blackout, how various operating and weather conditions may affect the power system performance and thus propulsion performance though the PMS power limiting control, how propulsion performance may affect the overall vessel performance, which kind of faults can be avoided if the control system is re-structured, how to minimize the operational costs and to deal with the conflicting goals. This PhD thesis aims to provide answers to such questions. The main contributions of this PhD thesis are: − A new observer-based fast load reduction system for the blackout prevention control has been proposed. When compared to the existing fast load reduction systems, the proposed controller gives much faster blackout detection rate, high reliability in the detection and faster and more precise load reduction (within 150 miliseconds). − New advanced energy management control strategies for reductions in the operational costs and improved fuel economy of the vessel. − Load limiting controllers for the reduction of thruster wear-out rate. These controllers are based on the probability of torque loss, real-time torque loss and the thruster shaft accelerations. The controllers provide means of redistributing thrust from load fluctuating thrusters to less load fluctuating ones, and may operate independently of the thrust allocation system. Another solution is also proposed where the load limiting controller based on thrust losses is an integrated part of DP thrust allocation algorithm. − A new concept of totally integrated thrust allocation system, local thruster control and power system. These systems are integrated through PMS functionality which is contained within each thruster PLC, thereby distributed among individual controllers, and independent of the communications and dedicated controllers. − Observer-based inertial controller and direct torque-loss controller (soft anti-spin controller) with particular attention to the control of machine wear-out rate. These controller contribute to general shaft speed control of electrical thrusters, generators and main propulsion prime movers. The proposed controllers, estimators and concepts are demonstrated through time-domain simulations performed in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The selected data are typical for the required applications and may differ slightly for the presented cases. PhD i marin teknikkPhD in Marine Technolog...|$|E
