5|$|Lucas' initial {{idea for}} Indiana's sidekick was a <b>virginal</b> young princess, but Huyck, Katz and Spielberg disliked the idea.

5|$|Romeo and Juliet was parodied in Shakespeare's own lifetime: Henry Porter's Two Angry Women of Abingdon (1598) and Thomas Dekker's Blurt, Master Constable (1607) both contain balcony {{scenes in}} which a <b>virginal</b> heroine engages in bawdy wordplay. The play {{directly}} influenced later literary works. For example, the preparations for a performance form a major plot arc in Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby.|$|E
25|$|In England, {{during the}} Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, any {{stringed}} keyboard instrument was {{often described as}} a <b>virginals,</b> and could equally apply to a harpsichord or possibly even a clavichord or spinet. Thus, the masterworks of William Byrd and his contemporaries were often played on full-size, Italian or Flemish harpsichords, and {{not only on the}} <b>virginals</b> as we call it today. Contemporary nomenclature often referred to a pair of <b>virginals,</b> which implied a single instrument, possibly a harpsichord with two registers, or a double <b>virginals</b> (see below).|$|R
2500|$|Spinet <b>virginals</b> (not to be {{confused}} with the spinet) were made principally in Italy (Italian: spinetta), England and Flanders (...) [...] The keyboard is placed left of centre, and the strings are plucked at one end, although further from the bridge than in the harpsichord. This is the more common arrangement for modern instruments, and an instrument described simply as a [...] "virginal" [...] is likely to be a spinet <b>virginals.</b> The principal differences in construction lie mainly in the placement of the keyboard: Italian instruments invariably had a keyboard that projected from the case, whilst northern <b>virginals</b> had their keyboards recessed in a keywell. The cases of Italian instruments were made of cypress wood and were of delicate manufacture, whilst northern <b>virginals</b> were usually more stoutly constructed of poplar. Early Italian <b>virginals</b> were usually hexagonal in shape, the case following the lines of the strings and bridges, and a few early Flemish examples are similarly made. From about 1580 however, nearly all <b>virginals</b> were rectangular, the Italian models often having an outer case like harpsichords from that country. There are very few surviving English <b>virginals,</b> all of them late. They generally follow the Flemish construction, but with a vaulted lid.|$|R
25|$|Both Italian and {{northern}} schools produced a miniature <b>virginals</b> called the ottavino. Ottavini were pitched an octave {{higher than the}} larger instrument. In the Flemish tradition these were often – perhaps always – sold together with a large <b>virginals,</b> to which the ottavino could be coupled (see Double <b>Virginals</b> below). In the Italian tradition, an ottavino was usually a separate instrument of its own, being fitted in its own outer case, just like larger Italian instruments.|$|R
5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned {{stereotypes}} of women as <b>virginal</b> brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E
5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips {{the hem of her}} red dress in a manner that recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's <b>virginal</b> purity and God's ethereal presence.|$|E

50|$|Spinet {{derives from}} the Italian spinetta, which in 17th-century Italian was a word used {{generally}} for all quilled instruments, especially what in Elizabethan/Jacobean English were called <b>virginals.</b> The specific Italian word for a <b>virginals</b> is spinetta a tabola. Likewise, the French derivation from spinetta, épinette, is specifically what the <b>virginals</b> is called in French, although the word is also used for any other small quilled instrument, whether a small harpsichord or a clavichord. In German, Spinett and Querflügel are used.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 he {{launched}} <b>Virginals,</b> a recital concept which {{pays tribute to}} some of the great contemporary composers of minimal, experimental and electroaucoustic music. Interpretations of pieces by Phill Niblock, Alvin Lucier, Walter Marchetti, Charlemagne Palestine and Francisco Lopez are performed by Mathieu on the <b>Virginals,</b> a Renaissance keyboard instrument, mechanical gramophones, electronic organs and other obsolete media. In 2010 Mathieu started to work with several composers on commissioned pieces for <b>Virginals,</b> Revenant by Tashi Wada, being the first result in this series, was premiered in June 2011 at Collège des Bernardins, Paris.|$|R
5000|$|The Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer was {{one among}} several who {{produced}} paintings including examples of <b>virginals.</b> There {{was no such}} [...] "standard decoration" [...] for Italian <b>virginals.</b> Where there was an outer case, it was often this that was decorated, leaving the actual instrument plain (typically for Venetian <b>virginals).</b> Cases could be decorated with paintings of grotesques, classical scenes, or marquetry, but soundboards were rarely painted. Keytops could be of plain boxwood, or lavishly decorated (as was often the case in northern Italy) with ivory, ebony, mother-of-pearl or tortoiseshell among other materials.|$|R

2500|$|As {{has been}} noted above, the word <b>virginals</b> {{could be applied to}} any {{stringed}} keyboard instrument, and since there was very rarely any indication of instrumentation on musical scores in the heyday of the <b>virginals,</b> there are hardly any compositions that can be said to be specifically for that instrument. Indeed, nearly all the keyboard music of the renaissance sounds equally well on harpsichord, <b>virginals,</b> clavichord or organ, and it is doubtful if any composer had a particular instrument in mind when writing keyboard scores. A list of composers for writing for the <b>virginals</b> (among other instruments) may be found under virginalist. Although the [...] "virginalist school" [...] usually refers to English composers, it would not be incorrect to use the word in connection with some continental keyboard composers of the period, such as Girolamo Frescobaldi and Giovanni Picchi, or Samuel Scheidt and Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck.|$|R
