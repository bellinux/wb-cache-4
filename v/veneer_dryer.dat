40|$|Graduation date: 1969 A source {{test was}} {{conducted}} to determine the particulate and the total gaseous hydrocarbon emissions from a gas heated <b>veneer</b> <b>dryer.</b> Samples were taken on eight separate days from the exhaust stacks while the dryer was processing Douglas fir veneer. Of the eight days, three {{was used to determine}} the gaseous hydrocarbon concentration using a flame ionization hydrocarbon detector and five were used to determine gravimetrically the particulate concentration. Experimental emission rates were 0. 87 pounds per hour for particulates and 16. 02 pounds per hour for gaseous hydrocarbons...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{potential}} of infrared (IR) technology in estimating the moisture content (MC) of birch (Betula pendula Roth) veneer was investigated. A total of 56 birch veneer sheets (42 × 130 cm 2) were dried with a convective type laboratory-scale <b>veneer</b> <b>dryer</b> at drying times ranging from 1 to 6 min at 1 min intervals. After drying, IR data were recorded and the veneer sheets were sawn into 100 × 100 mm 2 pieces. IR data were averaged {{over the same}} area and then the true MC and density values were assessed gravimetrically. The dependency between temperature and MC {{was found to be}} non-linear and between temperature and density there was no dependency. The relationship between temperature and MC was modeled with a neural network and a Gaussian model. Both model types gave similar results. At a true MC below 10 %, the root mean square error of prediction (RMSE) was 1. 5 % for the 100 × 100 mm 2 pieces and 1. 2 %, for the larger veneer sheets, whereas at higher MC (above 10 %), the RMSE increased to 2. 6 % for the 100 × 100 mm 2 pieces and 1. 9 % for the sheets. It was observed that the IR measurement should be taken within 5 s, since after that the RMSE increased rapidly. Based on the results of this study, it was concluded that veneer MC can be estimated with reasonably good accuracy using IR technology...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The drying of wood is {{required}} in most forest products manufacturing operations. Depending on the wood species, dimensions, drying temperatures, and drying duration, the amount of emissions and energy consumption can greatly affect the operating cost, environment, and quality of wood dried. As such, the forest products industry continues to explore the use of new technologies to address these points of concern. A study was done to evaluate {{the addition of a}} radio-frequency (RF) heating system to a natural gas-fired conventional <b>veneer</b> <b>dryer</b> as a means to reduce emissions, reduce energy consumption, and improve productivity while maintaining material quality. To establish the benefits of RF-assisted drying, a study comparison was made for drying wood veneer in a RF-assisted dryer and a conventional dryer. The study was conducted at Western Veneer and Slicing in White City, Oregon. This plant was selected because both types of dryers, an RF-assisted dryer manufactured by Production Machinery, Inc. and a conventional dryer manufactured by Amitec, were located at the same site and were used for drying the same type of material. Two comparison drying tests were conducted, one using sliced ponderosa pine and the other using rotary peeled Douglas-fir. The sliced veneer was selected because it was the type of material used by the White City plant and the rotary veneer was used because it is of the type used in the plywood industry. The parameters measured for each drying run were material flows, drying rates, emission rates, dryer operating conditions, exhaust conditions, and electrical and natural gas consumption. It was found that although the RF-assisted dryer was able to successfully dry the sliced veneer as it was designed to do, it was not properly "tuned" to efficiently dry the rotary veneer. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} should only be made for the sliced veneer studies. The study found that the RF-assisted dryer was able to reduce total emissions comprised of particulate, organic, and inorganic components. The emissions reduction was 16...|$|E

In the first part {{there is a fundamental}} characteristic of layered solid materials. Other chapters deal with the production of plywood as such, production and worldwide trends.

40|$|A new drying model {{originally}} derived for thin-wood veneer {{and successfully}} {{applied to the}} control of a <b>veneer</b> Jet <b>Dryer</b> may be extended for use in controlling the drying of such diverse products as textiles, dog food, pulp and paper, sawdust, lumber, fiberboard, gypsum board, crumb rubber, etc. In addition, such dryer types as Rotary Drum, Suspension, Flash, Through, Spray, Oven, Tray, Lime Kilns, etc., should be amenable to control utilizing this model. Moreover, it should apply to most thin slabs and webs utilizing either a hot circulating, gaseous medium (hot air) or a hot surface {{in direct contact with}} the product such as a paper machine steam drum. Control systems utilizing this new concept enable control of product moisture content prior to exiting the dryer as opposed to after-the-fact information presently utilized as a means of control...|$|R
40|$|Emission {{control devices}} on dryers and presses have been legislated into the industry, {{and are now}} an {{integral}} part of the drying system. These devices consume large quantities of natural gas and electricity and down-sizing or eliminating them will provide major energy savings. The principal strategy taken here focuses on developing process changes that should minimize (and in some cases eliminate) the need for controls. A second approach is to develop lower-cost control options. It has been shown in laboratory and full-scale work that Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) emerge mainly at the end of the press cycle for particleboard, and, by extension, to other prod-ucts. Hence, only the air associated with this point of the cycle need be captured and treated. A model for estimating terpene emissions in the various zones of <b>veneer</b> <b>dryers</b> has been developed. This should allow the emissions to be concentrated in some zones and minimized in others, so that some of the air could be directly released without controls. Low-cost catalysts have been developed for controlling HAPs from dryers and presses. Catalysts conventionally used for regenerative catalytic oxidizers can be used at much lower temperatures for treating press emissions. Fluidized wood ash is an especially inexpensive mate-rial for efficiently reducing formaldehyde in dryer emissions. A heat transfer model for estimating pinene emissions from hot-pressing strand for the manufacture of flakeboard has been constructed from first principles and validated. The model shows that most of the emissions originate from the 1 -mm layer of wood adjoining the platen surface. Hence, a simple control option is to surface a softwood mat with a layer of hardwood prior to pressing. Fines release a disproportionate large quantity of HAPs, and it has been shown both theo-retically and in full-scale work that particles smaller than 400 ÃÂÃÂµm are principally responsible. Georgia-Pacific is considering green-screening their furnish at several of their mills in order to remove these particles and reduce their treatment costs...|$|R
