30|$|Carbon black, if pure, {{should be}} {{deprived}} of elements detectable by EDXRF analysis; on the contrary, it is very absorbent of infrared radiation so that the infrared image obtained by IR reflectography can make its presence visible. Reflectography is widely used on painting for under-drawing examination. For this reason, there is a deep knowledge of the response of black painting media. We performed long wave infrared reflectography (with sensitivity ranging 1000 – 2500  nm) because, in this range of wavelength, carbon black pigments are strong absorber while iron-gallic ink are transparent [10]. There are some other materials, such as hematite (iron oxide) which have instead an intermediate behaviour at these wavelengths. The iron-gallic dyes, {{on the basis of}} the ancient recipes, were produced by mixing vegetal extracts (tannins obtained by gall-nuts) with inorganic salts (mainly <b>vitriols,</b> nominally iron sulphates with other metal sulphates such manganese, copper, zinc, lead and others). For this reason, this kind of pigments is very well characterized by EDXRF analysis, but it is transparent to IR radiation.|$|R

50|$|The first {{recorded}} {{mention of the}} mine dates to 1683, {{as a source of}} alum, iron and copper <b>vitriols</b> (sulfates), sulfur, and colored clay. The colours of the stalactites are produced by the minerals in the mine. In 1717 the merchant Johann Leonard Morassi bought the mine and named it Morassina. In 1750 the Leipzig trading firm of Frege bought it and became extremely wealthy from it; in 1816 they were able to buy back the Crown Jewels of Saxony, carried off by Napoleon, from Amsterdam. However, the bottom fell out of the market after chemical methods of synthesizing alum and sulfuric acid were introduced around 1850. The mine was not worked after 1860, and was closed up and forgotten. In 1851, miners seeking uranium discovered it and the stalactite formations, but because of its location near the Inner German Border, the East German authorities refused until 1998 to allow it to be opened to visitors. It was finally opened in 1993. There is a mining museum (opened in 1995) and the St. Barbara licensed spa (opened in 1997); radium cures are offered.|$|R
5000|$|... “Turning {{away from}} coke” and {{replacing}} {{it in the first}} phase with natural gas became one of the main directions of the modernisation of production. The localisation of the factory in the territory through which the south main gas conduit east - west ran made such decision obvious. Azoty, located nearest to the natural gas deposits among all largest recipients, had good conditions to exploit this material. The program of intensification of the production of ammonia and fertilisers, also named “Tarnów I”, was performed in steps. The initial aim was the reconstruction of the ammonia plant to reach the capacity of 480 tons per day by further development of two new gas generators for ammonia synthesis out of coke and two generators producing gas for ammonia synthesis on the basis of natural gas, construction of installations for natural gas conversion, modernisation of gas purification for ammonia synthesis out of carbon oxide by implementation of a so-called copper washing method. In the scope of expansion of productive capacities of nitric acid, five new units for technological nitric acid with pressure method designed in cooperation with T. Hobler (so-called Hydro-Nitro-Hobler) were commissioned, the second unit for nitric acid with non-pressure method was built, and, then, the installation for nitric acid condensed to 110 tons per day and nitrous <b>vitriols</b> to 180 tons per day was intensified.|$|R
6000|$|I {{slept in}} a dingy sheeted bed with the two elder {{survivors}} of Frapp fecundity, and spent my week days in helping in the laborious disorder of the shop and bakehouse, in incidental deliveries of bread and so forth, and in parrying the probings of my uncle into my relations with the Blood, and his confidential explanations that ten shillings a week--which was what my mother paid him--was not enough to cover my accommodation. He was very anxious to keep that, but also he wanted more. There were neither books nor any seat nor corner in that house where reading was possible, no newspaper ever brought the clash of worldly things into its heavenward seclusion; horror of it all grew in me daily, and whenever I could I escaped into the streets and tramped about Chatham. The news shops appealed to me particularly. One saw there smudgy illustrated sheets, the Police News in particular, in which vilely drawn pictures brought home to the dullest intelligence an interminable succession of squalid crimes, women murdered and put into boxes, buried under floors, old men bludgeoned at midnight by robbers, people thrust suddenly out of trains, happy lovers shot, <b>vitrioled</b> and so forth by rivals.

25|$|Nevertheless, Greig helped Packer {{by signing}} {{a number of}} English and foreign players he was acquainted with.

Finally, after a week of politicking, Greig was removed from the England captaincy.|$|E
25|$|The {{advances}} {{made in the}} Middle East in botany {{and chemistry}} led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) (865–915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples’ from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973–1050) wrote {{one of the most}} valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250–1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq’s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper <b>vitriol,</b> and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} his many {{achievements}} since 1776, Bolts’s venture on the whole had made a loss, {{to the dismay of}} his Belgian financial backers, Charles Proli and his associates. Proli also disagreed with Bolts over the importance of the China market: Proli wanted to concentrate exclusively on that market while Bolts urged the equal importance of India as Austrian commodities, such as mercury, lead, copper, iron, tin and <b>vitriol,</b> could find sale there, in contrast to China where only Spanish silver dollars were accepted in return for Chinese products such as tea, porcelain and silk. While Bolts was still in India, the Proli group sent out two ships, the Ville de Vienne to Mauritius and the Prince Kaunitz to China, without informing him. In ignorance of Bolts’s purchase of a ship he called the Prince Kaunitz, the Proli group sent another ship of the same name to China independently of him. This constituted a breach of their contract with him. They refused to honour the bills he drew upon their bank while he was in India. They petitioned the Imperial Government to have his charter transferred exclusively to them. They also seized the Joseph et Therese as security when the vessel returned to Leghorn. At an audience with Emperor Joseph II in Brussels on 28 July 1781, Bolt and Proli agreed to the transformation of their association into a share company, and in August Bolts surrendered his charters to the new Imperial Company of Trieste and Antwerp for the Commerce of Asia (Société Impériale pour le Commerce Asiatique de Trieste et d’Anvers). The Company was to send six ships to China and India, two to East Africa and Mauritius, and three for the southern whale fishery.|$|E
