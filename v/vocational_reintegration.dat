40|$|Background: <b>Vocational</b> <b>reintegration</b> is an {{important}} goal in the rehabilitation process. The amputees had {{to take time to}} adjust themselves to their new condition after lower limb amputation and that might have an impact on their vocation. As yet, there has been no information regarding <b>vocational</b> <b>reintegration</b> among the lower limb amputees in Thailand. Objectives: To study the rate of <b>vocational</b> <b>reintegration,</b> factors associated with <b>vocational</b> <b>reintegration</b> among the lower limb amputees. Material and Method: The postal survey with the questionnaires to 1, 300 amputees who received the lower limb prostheses between 2001 and 2005 was conducted. The participants were divided into two groups namely the employed and unemployed groups. The Chi-Square and the Independent Sample T Test were used to compare {{the difference between the two}} groups. The multiple variables analysis by stepwise logistic regression was used to determine the associated factors. Results: Three hundred and nine questionnaires were completed among 321 returned questionnaires (response rate 24. 7 %). Two hundred and forty seven males and 62 females with age ranging from 18 - 82 years old participated. The rate of <b>vocational</b> <b>reintegration</b> was 66. 7 %.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to describe the process of job reintegration, to obtain more detailed information about workplace adjustments, and to assess the positive and negative experiences of amputees (in the Netherlands) who returned to paid work after their lower limb amputation. The study had a retrospective design with semi-structured interviews. The authors used a qualitative methodology to obtain detailed information on the reintegration process. Thirty-two (32) subjects participated {{with a mean age of}} 42. 6 years. The mean time between amputation and return to work was nearly one year (11. 5 months). The most common reasons for delay in return to work were stump problems and problems in wound healing. Fifty percent (50 %) of the amputees got different work tasks or another job than before amputation, mainly because of physical restrictions caused by the amputation. The most important motives of the amputees for job reintegration were work as a form of day spending (69 %) and social contacts at the workplace (66 %). Bad support of the implementing body which takes care of job reintegration and employer (34 %) were the most mentioned obstacle to job <b>reintegration.</b> <b>Vocational</b> workers should be regular members in the rehabilitation teams for amputees.

5000|$|In 1935, an {{opportunity}} arose for Krusen {{to expand the}} field of physical medicine when he was appointed chair of the new Section of Physical Therapy at the Mayo Clinic. Actually, the roots of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) at the Mayo Clinic started in 1911, 25 years before Krusen arrived, when {{the new head of}} the Section on Orthopedic Surgery, Melvin S. Henderson, MD, established physiotherapy services for postoperative orthopedic patients. By 1918, the Section of Physiotherapy was formed within orthopedics. Members of the Social Services Department in 1921 established occupation therapy services due to the need for avocational, <b>vocational,</b> and community <b>reintegration</b> interventions for patients. Another physiotherapy service was developed, from 1923-1924, by Arthur Desjardins, MD, within the Section of Radiology. This service focused on the treatment and training on modalities for tissue healing using high-frequency diathermy, hydrotherapy, and electrotherapy. As could be predicted, tension developed between the 2 physiotherapy groups, and misunderstandings brewed for nearly a decade. Over time, neither of the departments had the time or interest in supervising physical medicine practices. Thus, the stage was set for recruiting a physician leader in this developing area of medicine centered on physical medicine. With all parties agreeing to an independent section, Krusen arrived in 1935, beginning a 28-year career at the Mayo Clinic, where he would further develop the field of PM&R through the major accomplishments of his career [...]The integrated group practice model at Mayo Clinic proved to be an ideal environment for Krusen to develop the specialty of physical medicine. Within his first seven years at the Mayo Clinic, he successfully integrated the various components of physiotherapy practice under one section. The department staff grew from a mere 18 to 108 people, with an increase of 83% in the patient population that received treatment. Krusen also established Mayo Clinic's School of Physical Therapy in 1938, with 54 students in each class, a program that has trained thousands of physical therapists over the past 75 years.Krusen was skillful at using educational formats to bring people together for collaboration. His initial 5 rotating residents from other specialties quickly evolved into the nation's first 3-year resident training program in physical medicine, established in 1936. Earl Elkins, MD), and Robert Bennett, MD 9, 2 other pioneers in the field of PM&R, were Krusen's first Mayo physical medicine residency graduates. The resident training program has since graduated hundreds of physiatrists and fellows.Statements in Krusen's diary suggest that it is likely the unique practice environment at the Mayo Clinic that facilitated his efforts to expand the field in a number of ways. It fostered his efforts to centralize all therapy efforts under one physician leader, and he found support to grow the practice from other established departments, including orthopedic surgery, radiology, and internal medicine. Krusen's intellectual, organizational, and interpersonal skills found their perfect expression at the Mayo Clinic, where his efforts resulted in physical medicine gaining needed visibility within an internationally known medical institution. “Rehabilitation is to be a key word in medicine,” predicted William Mayo in 1925. Years later, his nephew, Charles Mayo commented, “My late uncle made this prediction … and ten years later he brought to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, the physician who, {{perhaps more than any other}} individual, has helped make this prediction come true”. In 1938, Krusen included the following comments in his personal journal on his experience at the Mayo Clinic: “As in past years, the relationship to other departments has been most satisfactory from our standpoint. As with every new field of medical endeavor, there is a certain amount of passive resistance to its development; however, this is less apparent in the Mayo Clinic than in any other institution with which I have been connected. The feeling of cordial cooperation which exists throughout the institution is a never-ending source of pleasure” (internal document, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN).|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{significance}} of selected resources and potential risk factors for mastering a  retrainig program {{within the context of}} vocational rehabilitation. Four criteria for successful mastery are specified: 1) completion, 2) academic achievement, 3) physical and psychical well-being, and 4) <b>vocational</b> <b>reintegration.</b> Rather stable characteristics such as participants' age, education and motivation for the choice of occupation are assumed to be potential predictors of success, as well as more dynamic characteristics, developing and changing during the course of retraining. Within the dynamic characteristics structural (e. g. housing), class-specific (e. g. classroom climate), and individual factors (e. g. self-efficacy, status of health) are differentiated.   In order to evaluate the relational pattern of  the characteristics described a longitudinal study with the participants of a two-year retraining program conducted by the Berufsförderungswerk Berlin was realized. The participants were questioned every six months, i. e. five times during the two year retraining program. The statistical analyses show that primarily motivation for the choice of re-training, self-efficacy and status of health have a substantial meaning for succeeding in or failing the vocational retraining. Participants, who choose the retraining out of self-motivation and out of interest, who are confident of mastering the retraining and whose physical condition is good, have a good chance to finish the program successfully. Depending on the individual pattern the dropout-risk as well as academic achievement and well-being are determined directly or indirectly, e. g. through absenteeism. The question, whether <b>vocational</b> <b>reintegration</b> itself will be successful or not, cannot be answered with the data at issue; hence, further research is needed.   </html...|$|E
40|$|Although {{considerable}} {{research has}} been undertaken on psychosocial treatment and rehabilitation of patients with chronic schizophrenia, {{few studies have examined}} individual courses by means of repeated and frequent observation. A more dynamic view of rehabil-itation might disclose patterns of response useful for both understanding and treating symptoms and dis-abilities associated with chronic schizophrenia. In an exploratory study, time series of 35 schizophrenia out-patients participating in a vocational rehabilitation program were examined by a relatively original quan-titative approach to the identification of dynamical patterns. By using time series regression on weekly behavioral ratings, dynamical properties of mean, trend, and variability were calculated. Cluster analysis revealed five subgroups of courses: (1) stable at a high level, (2) fluctuating at a middle level, (3) at a middle level, tending toward a slight descent, (4) showing a steep descent, and (5) unstable at a low level of func-tioning. The subgroups varied at intake in psy-chopathology; in cognitive dysfunction; and in mea-sures of self-concept, locus of control, and coping. At program end, pronounced differences were found among the subgroups in <b>vocational</b> <b>reintegration.</b> These different dynamical patterns can be understood as typical pathways linking patient characteristics to rehabilitation outcome. A broader use of dynamical designs could substantially clarify the variety of reac-tions of patients to psychosocial interventions...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a 35 -year old male patient presenting with depressed mood and emotional instability who complained about severe anterograde and retrograde memory deficits characterized by accelerated long-term forgetting {{and loss of}} autonoetic consciousness regarding autobiographical memories {{of the last three}} years. Months before he had experienced two breakdowns of unknown etiology giving rise to the differential diagnosis of epileptic seizures after various practitioners and clinics had suggested different etiologies such as a psychosomatic condition, burnout, depression or dissociative amnesia. Neuropsychological assessment indicated selectively impaired figural memory performance. Extended diagnostics confirmed accelerated forgetting of previously learned and retrievable verbal material. Structural imaging showed bilateral swelling and signal alterations of temporomesial structures (left > right). Video-EEG monitoring revealed a left temporal epileptic focus and subclincal seizure, but no overt seizures. Antibody tests in serum and liquor were positive for glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies. These findings led to the diagnosis of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody related limbic encephalitis. Monthly steroid pulses over six months led to recovery of subjective memory and to intermediate improvement but subsequent worsening of objective memory performance. During the course of treatment the patient reported de novo paroxysmal non-responsive states. Thus, antiepileptic treatment was started and the patient finally became seizure free. At the last visit <b>vocational</b> <b>reintegration</b> was successfully in progress. In conclusion, amygdala swelling, retrograde biographic memory impairment, accelerated long-term forgetting and emotional instability may serve as indicators of limbic encephalitis, {{even in the absence of}} overt epileptic seizures. The monitoring of such patients calls for a standardized and concerted multilevel diagnostic approach with repeated assessments...|$|E
40|$|Given their flexibility, online {{interventions}} may {{be useful}} as an outpatient treatment option to support <b>vocational</b> <b>reintegration</b> after inpatient rehabilitation. To that purpose we devised a transdiagnostic psychodynamic online intervention to facilitate return to work, focusing on interpersonal conflicts at the workplace often responsible for work-related stress. In a randomized controlled trial, we included employed patients from cardiologic, psychosomatic and orthopedic rehabilitation with work-related stress or need for support at intake to inpatient rehabilitation after they had given written consent {{to take part in}} the study. Following discharge, maladaptive interpersonal interactions at the workplace were identified via weekly blogs and processed by written therapeutic comments over 12 weeks in the intervention group (IG). The control group (CG) received an augmented treatment as usual condition. The main outcome, subjective prognosis of gainful employment (SPE), and secondary outcomes (psychological complaints) were assessed by means of online questionnaires before, at the end of aftercare (3 months) and at follow-up (12 months). We used ITT analyses controlling for baseline scores and medical group. N = 319 patients were enrolled into IG and N = 345 into CG. 77 % of the IG logged in to the webpage (CG 74 %) and 65 % of the IG wrote blogs. Compared to the CG, the IG reported a significantly more positive SPE at follow-up. Measures of depression, anxiety and psychosocial stressors decreased from baseline to follow-up, whereas the corresponding scores increased in the CG. Correspondingly, somatization and psychological quality of life improved in the IG. Psychodynamic online aftercare was effective to enhance subjective prognosis of future employment and improved psychological complaints across a variety of chronic physical and psychological conditions, albeit with small effect sizes...|$|E
40|$|Study design: Survey. Objectives: To {{explore the}} process of {{reintegration}} in paid work following a traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), including the role of early expectations of individual patients regarding return to work, indicators of success of job reintegration and a description of reintegration interventions and barriers. Setting: Dutch rehabilitation centre with special department for patients with spinal cord injuries. Methods: Descriptive analysis of data gathered by a mailed questionnaire, which was returned by 57 persons (response 83 %) with traumatic SCI, aged 18 - 60 years, and data of earlier expectations reported by the individual patients during the rehabilitation admission following SCI from 1990 to 1998. Results: Of 49 respondents who were employed {{at the moment of}} the SCI, 45 % expected to be able to resume work. These positive expectations were associated with a higher educational level. In 67 %, return to work was successful. The chance to reintegrate successfully was better if the patient expected to resume work. Logistic regression analysis did not reveal other significant indicators. About one-third of the 49 respondents working preinjury followed vocational retraining, which was successful for most of them so far. In the majority of work situations modi. cations have been made, such as job adaptations and reduction of working hours. Several unmet needs regarding reintegration interventions were also reported. Conclusions: Positive expectations regarding resumption of work after a SCI are an important indicator of successful reintegration in work. An active role of the rehabilitation team is recommended in drawing up a <b>vocational</b> <b>reintegration</b> plan to prepare the patient, the employer and professionals involved in the reintegration process...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate life satisfaction and employment status after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and to explain the associations between life satisfaction and demographic, disease-related, psychological, and personality characteristics. Subjects with SAH (n = 141) living at home 2 - 4 years after the SAH responded to a mailed questionnaire. Outcomes were life satisfaction, as measured with the Life Satisfaction Questionnaire 9 (LiSat- 9), and employment status. Determinants in multiple regression analysis were demographic and SAH characteristics, subjective complaints (eg, mood disorder, fatigue, cognitive complaints), and personality characteristics (eg, neuroticism, passive coping style). Of the 141 subjects, 64 (46. 7 %) had a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of V (good outcome) at discharge. Mean subject age was 51. 4 +/- 12. 3 years, and mean time after SAH was 36. 1 +/- 7. 9 months. Of the 88 subjects who were working {{at the time of the}} SAH, 54 (61. 4 %) returned to work, but only 31 (35. 2 %) resumed their work completely. The subjects were least satisfied with their vocational situation (51. 9 % satisfied) and sexual life (51. 7 %) and were most satisfied with their relationships (75. 2 %- 88. 7 %) and self-care ability (88. 6 %). Age (beta value = 0. 17), return to work after SAH (0. 19), disability at hospital discharge (0. 25), worsened mood (- 0. 37), and passive coping (- 0. 25) together accounted for 47. 2 % of the life satisfaction scores.

40|$|It {{might seem}} incongruous {{to bring forward}} {{the issue of the}} <b>vocational</b> <b>reintegration</b> of the {{homeless}} in a time deeply marked by fragmented career histories and beset by looming widespread unemployment. But this issue will loose none of its urgent topicality as long as work continues to be a key factors in shaping life, conferring social participation and social prestige, recognition and self-respect - or for as long as employment, career and the family retain their power as vital constituents of identity whose loss can precipitate or exacerbate a descent into homelessness. Against this backdrop, one of the central concerns of the present study is to investigate and evaluate the framework conditions for reintegration projects whose holistic approach has been extended to take in the area of "work" alongside other key life-areas such as "housing", "health" and "leisure". This also involves elucidating those conditions which inhibit institutions caring for the homeless from offering vocational opportunities, and thus from acting as socialisation instances along the path of long-term destitution. A multiple-perspective approach has been adopted based on: 1) an historical-theoretical analysis of institutions caring for the homeless; 2) a quantitative survey of 760 homeless persons and persons facing homelessness, assessing their aptitude for vocational (re-) integration in terms of motivation, professional qualification, health, and psycho-social outlook; 3) a qualitative expert survey for the reconstruction of action-weighted orientation in key actors in the provision of care for the homeless, and; 4) comparative case studies of six Berlin vocational employment projects in the homeless sector. As the results of the quantitative survey show, loss of employment remains one of the key triggers of homelessness. Furthermore, the longer the period of unemployment continues, the greater is its negative impact on the homeless person in terms of worsening motivation, health, and psycho-social outlook. Thus vocational and professional qualification projects play a preventive role in pre-empting even greater deprivation during the term of homelessness. From an historical perspective, however, it is apparent that vocational measures based on coercion and discipline have an markedly adverse effect on homeless peoples' attempts to re-enter the world of work. Constructive coping strategies that actively promote attempts to leave homelessness behind can only be put in place in projects based on such key principles as direct involvement of the homeless, voluntary, non-coercive participation, self-organisation, personal responsibility for daily organisation, integrated social and vocational qualification programmes, empowerment, and the physical separation of living quarters and work. </p...|$|E
40|$|In Bangladesh, a {{majority}} of individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCI) are either poor or very poor. In most cases, their families undergo extreme hardship as they lose the income of the only or main earning member, and are unable to bear costs of rehabilitation. Purpose: This mixed method study explored perspectives of individuals with SCI regarding financial aid {{in the form of}} interest-free loans for their treatment and rehabilitation at the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed (CRP). Method: In {{the first part of the}} study, 10 semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted. In the second part of the study, 40 persons with SCI were surveyed. The qualitative method involved selection of respondents according to their age, sex and severity of disability. Quantitative interviews were conducted with all persons with SCI in the final stage of hospital rehabilitation, in the third quarter of 2008. Results: Though CRP provides financial support depending on the individual’s economic status, many persons with SCI needed additional funding from multiple sources, such as savings (42. 5 %), mortgaging assets (12. 5 %), selling assets (45 %), receiving loans (37. 5 %), begging for money (42. 5 %), and receiving donations from relatives (47. 5 %) or the community (30 %), to meet the direct and indirect costs of rehabilitation. Majority (85 %) of those interviewed wanted to receive financial aid in the form of interest-free loans. 76. 4 % of them wanted the loans to be disbursed in two phases; initially, to offset some of their costs during rehabilitation at CRP, and thereafter, for economic reintegration in their community. The remaining 23. 6 % wanted the loan only for <b>vocational</b> <b>reintegration.</b> 70. 59 % of those interviewed proposed repayment in monthly instalments, while 17. 64 % suggested quarterly instalments and 11. 76 % favoured annual instalments. Over half of the participants (55. 88 %) wanted to have vocational training, and the rest wanted vocational training for their family members, to enable them to repay the loan. Conclusions: This study revealed that there is a huge demand for interest-free loans among people with SCI. An appropriately designed interest-free loan programme, which would be sensitive to individual needs, could save people with SCI and their families from bankruptcy. This would also make SCI rehabilitation programmes more sustainable, and possibly reduce over-dependence on the donors.
