40|$|Six {{isolates}} of egg drop syndrome (EDS) virus {{were recovered}} from five different outbreaks of EDS in commercial laying hens {{in and around}} Faisalabad. The aberrant eggs were fed to the susceptible laying hens for experimental induction of infection. The samples from infected birds (egg washing, cloacal swabs, oviducts and spleens) were collected, processed and inoculated into 11 -day old duck embryos. The presence of virus in harvested allanto-amniotic fluid was monitored by spot and microhaemagglutination tests and confirmed by haemagglutination inhibition and agar gel precipitation tests. The EDS virus grew well in duck embryos and agglutinated only avian but not mammalian red blood cells. These isolates were purified through <b>velocity</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugation.</b> Protein concentration was determined through Lowry method and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was conducted by loading 300 µg protein concentration on 12. 5 % gel using discontinuous buffer system. All the six isolates showed 13 polypeptides, which were identical to those described in the referral EDS- 76 virus (strain- 127).

Phage particles (coliphage 15) were recovered from the resulting lysate by treatment with deoxyribonuclease, filtration, and several cycles of differential centrifugation. Analysis of the phage particles obtained by using cesium chloride <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugation</b> in a preparative ultracentrifuge resulted in the resolution of three components. The major component had a peak density of 1. 52 to 1. 53 g/cm 3 followed by components with densities of 1. 5 and 1. 49 g/cm 3. The guanine plus cytosine content of coliphage 15 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was determined by both analytical ultracentrifugation in cesium chloride and by thermal denaturation in standard saline citrate buffer. Respective values of 46. 4 ± 1 % and 46. 6 ± 1 % guanine plus cytosine content were obtained.

40|$|A {{structural}} protein of Rauscher oncovirus of about 8, 000 to 10, 000 daltons (p 10), encoded by the gag gene, has been purified in high yield to apparent homogeneity {{by a simple}} three-step procedure. The purified protein was highly basic, with an isoelectric point of more than 9. 0, and its immunological antigenicity was chiefly group specific. A distinctive property of the protein was the binding to nucleic acids. The stoichiometry of p 10 binding to Rauscher virus RNA was analyzed using both 125 I-labeled p 10 and 3 H-labeled RNA. The protein-RNA complex, cross-linked by formaldehyde, was separated from free RNA and free protein by <b>velocity</b> sedimentation and <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugation.</b> A maximum of about 140 mol of p 10 was bound per mol of 35 S RNA, or about one molecule of p 10 per 70 nucleotides. This protein-RNA complex banded at a density of about 1. 55 g/ml. The number of nucleic acid sites bound and the affinity of p 10 binding differed significantly among the other polynucleotides tested. The protein bound to both RNA and DNA with a preference for single-stranded molecules. Rauscher virus RNA and single-stranded phage fd DNA contained {{the highest number of}} binding sites. Binding to fd DNA was saturated with about 30 mol of p 10 per mol of fd DNA, an average of about one p 10 molecule per 180 nucleotides. The apparent binding constant was 7. 3 X 10 (7) M(- 1). The properties of the p 10 place it in a category with other nucleic acid binding proteins that achieve a greater binding density on single-stranded than on double-stranded molecules and appear to act by facilitating changes in polynucleotide conformation...|$|R
