The use of series compensa-tor (SC) is proposed, not only {{to mitigate the effect}} of voltage sag/swell, but also to reduce the distortions due to the presence of non-linear loads in the network. A method of harmonics compensation is described. In the process of the compensation, it is shown that the SC will exchange energy with the external network. It causes undesirable variations in the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminals</b> of the SC energy storage system (ESS). A method to maintain the voltage of the ESS is then described.

40|$|High Temperature Superconducting {{devices for}} {{absolute}} Noise Thermometry are under {{development for the}} measurement of temperature in the 10 - 50 K range. This Thesis is concerned with two complementary methods which have been developed in parallel. The first technique, Josephson Linewidth Thermometry, uses a HTS Josephson junction shunted by a low resistance noble metal resistor. The conversion of thermal voltage fluctuations via the ac Josephson effect results in thermal broadening of the Josephson oscillation linewidth. Single and double junction HTS R-SQUIDs have been fabricated where a shunt resistance #approx# 25 #mu##OMEGA# has been achieved. In the double junction R-SQUIDs, where the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminals</b> is modulated at the Josephson heterodyne frequency, the first reported observations of Josephson heterodyne oscillations in HTS R-SQUIDs have been made and the linearity of the voltage-frequency relationship established. The second approach, known as the Quantum Roulette Noise Thermometer, uses the thermal motion of magnetic flux through a superconducting loop containing a Josephson junction. The Josephson junction is momentarily made non-superconducting and repeated measurements of the quantised flux state enable the statistical distribution of the flux in the loop to be measured, from which the temperature is derived. Inductance simulations {{have been used to}} optimise the QRNT device design and the first published prototype devices have been fabricated. Preliminary results are presented on the characteristics and behaviour of these new devices.
