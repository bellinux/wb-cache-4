40|$|High Temperature Superconducting {{devices for}} {{absolute}} Noise Thermometry are under {{development for the}} measurement of temperature in the 10 - 50 K range. This Thesis is concerned with two complementary methods which have been developed in parallel. The first technique, Josephson Linewidth Thermometry, uses a HTS Josephson junction shunted by a low resistance noble metal resistor. The conversion of thermal voltage fluctuations via the ac Josephson effect results in thermal broadening of the Josephson oscillation linewidth. Single and double junction HTS R-SQUIDs have been fabricated where a shunt resistance #approx# 25 #mu##OMEGA# has been achieved. In the double junction R-SQUIDs, where the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminals</b> is modulated at the Josephson heterodyne frequency, the first reported observations of Josephson heterodyne oscillations in HTS R-SQUIDs have been made and the linearity of the voltage-frequency relationship established. The second approach, known as the Quantum Roulette Noise Thermometer, uses the thermal motion of magnetic flux through a superconducting loop containing a Josephson junction. The Josephson junction is momentarily made non-superconducting and repeated measurements of the quantised flux state enable the statistical distribution of the flux in the loop to be measured, from which the temperature is derived. Inductance simulations {{have been used to}} optimise the QRNT device design and the first published prototype devices have been fabricated. Preliminary results are presented on the characteristics and behaviour of these new devices.
