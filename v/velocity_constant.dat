50|$|A {{free body}} diagram is {{analyzed}} by summing {{all of the}} forces, often accomplished by summing the forces {{in each of the}} axis directions. When the net force is zero, the body must be at rest or must be moving at a constant <b>velocity</b> (<b>constant</b> speed and direction), by Newton's first law. If the net force is not zero, then the body is accelerating in that direction according to Newton's second law.|$|E
50|$|In an {{isotonic}} contraction, tension {{remains the}} same, whilst the muscle's length changes. Isotonic contractions differ from isokinetic contractions in that in isokinetic contractions the muscle speed remains constant. While superficially identical, as the muscle's force changes via the length-tension relationship during a contraction, an isotonic contraction will keep force constant while velocity changes, but an isokinetic contraction will keep <b>velocity</b> <b>constant</b> while force changes. A near isotonic contraction {{is known as}} Auxotonic contraction.|$|E

5000|$|The {{precession}} {{depends on}} accelerated motion, and the non-collinearity of the particles instantaneous velocity and acceleration. No precession occurs if the particle moves with uniform <b>velocity</b> (<b>constant</b> [...] so [...] ), or accelerates {{in a straight}} line (in which case [...] and [...] are parallel or antiparallel so their cross product is zero). The particle has to move in a curve, say an arc, spiral, helix, or a circular orbit or elliptical orbit, for its frame to precess. The angular velocity of the precession is a maximum if the velocity and acceleration vectors are perpendicular throughout the motion (a circular orbit), and is large if their magnitudes are large (the magnitude of [...] is almost [...] ).|$|E
50|$|In {{this step}} of the processing, the radar tracker seeks to {{determine}} which plots {{should be used to}} update which tracks. In many approaches, a given plot can only be used to update one track. However, in other approaches a plot can be used to update several tracks, recognising the uncertainty in knowing to which track the plot belongs. Either way, {{the first step in the}} process is to update all of the existing tracks to the current time by predicting their new position based on the most recent state estimate (e.g. position, heading, speed, acceleration, etc.) and the assumed target motion model (e.g. constant <b>velocity,</b> <b>constant</b> acceleration, etc.). Having updated the estimates, it is possible to try to associate the plots to tracks.|$|E
50|$|Delay {{lines are}} made of lumped {{elements}} of L and C. The parasitic L and the C from the transistors are used for this and usually some L is added to raise the line impedance. Because of the Miller effect in the common source amplifier the input and the output transmission line are coupled. For example, for voltage inverting and current amplifying the input and the output form a shielded balanced line. The current is increasing in the output transmission line with every subsequent transistor, and therefore less and less L is added to keep the voltage constant {{and more and more}} extra C is added to keep the <b>velocity</b> <b>constant.</b> This C can come from parasitics of a second stage. These delay lines do not have a flat dispersion near their cut off, so it is important to use the same L-C periodicity in the input and the output. If inserting transmission lines, input and output will disperse away from each other.|$|E

50|$|At {{the next}} level of approximation, as the {{particle}} orbits and moves along the field line, along which the field changes slowly, the radius of the orbit changes so as to keep the magnetic flux enclosed by the orbit constant. Since the Lorentz force is strictly perpendicular to the velocity, it cannot change the energy of a charged particle moving in it. Thus the particle's kinetic energy remains constant. Then so also must its speed be constant. Then it can be shown that the particle's velocity parallel to the local field must decrease if the field is increasing along its z motion, and increase if the field decreases, while the components of the velocity transverse to the field increase or decrease so as to keep the magnitude of the total <b>velocity</b> <b>constant.</b> Conservation of energy prevents the transverse velocity from increasing without limit, and eventually the longitudinal component of the velocity becomes zero, while the pitch angle, of the particle with respect to the field line, becomes 90°. Then the longitudinal motion is stopped and reversed, and the particle is reflected back towards regions of weaker field, the guiding center now retracing its previous motion along the field line, with the particle's transverse velocity decreasing and its longitudinal velocity increasing.|$|E
