5|$|Spinal disc {{herniation}} {{occurs when}} the Intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the <b>vertebral</b> <b>canal</b> where the spinal cord resides. Once the cord is compressed, the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back/neck pain to leg paralysis, loss of sensation, and urinary and fecal incontinence. The most commonly location seen is the mid-back area, but it may occur anywhere along the spine. Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E

40|$|When {{the body}} endures {{physiological}} stress during childhood it will react by disrupting {{the growth of}} skeletal elements. By doing so, the body {{will be able to}} utilize nutrients for survival rather than putting energy towards growth. When a physiological disruption leaves a permanent mark on the skeleton or dentition it is called a non-specific indicator of stress. A small <b>vertebral</b> neural <b>canal</b> is one such non-specific indicator of stress. The <b>vertebral</b> neural <b>canal</b> is the hole in each vertebra through which the spinal cord passes. A small <b>vertebral</b> neural <b>canal</b> is an indicator of physiological stress during childhood. This thesis examines the relationship between physiological stress and urbanization by studying the <b>vertebral</b> neural <b>canal</b> size. Adults from St Mary Graces, a medieval skeletal collection with a mixed socioeconomic status, and St Bride’s Lower, a post-medieval collection with a low to middle class socioeconomic status, were analyzed for this study. Both archaeological sites are located in London, England, which was already an urban settlement during medieval times, but became even more urbanized during the post-medieval period. Measurements of the inner and outer diameter of the <b>vertebral</b> neural <b>canal</b> were taken. Statistical analysis was used to determine whether there were any differences in <b>vertebral</b> neural <b>canal</b> size between the two archaeological sites. The data was also used to establish whether there were any differences in <b>vertebral</b> neural <b>canal</b> size between sexes and age groups. Results show that the physiological stress did not increase with increased urbanization in the St Bride’s Lower sample and that males benefited more from the further urbanization of London than the females. The study also showed that only the inner diameter, and not the outer diameter, provided information on physiological stress. Overall, this study has further defined the possibilities and limitations of using the <b>vertebral</b> neural <b>canal</b> diameter as an indicator of stress and increased our understanding of the impact of urbanization on physiological stress...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a recent {{emphasis}} in bioarchaeology {{on the relationship between}} early-life stress and risk for early mortality. Increasingly, this research is framed within the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis. Multiple skeletal indicators, including <b>vertebral</b> neural <b>canal</b> size, have been used to assess the link between stresses in childhood with risk of earlier mortality. Recent study of <b>vertebral</b> neural <b>canal</b> (VNC) size in archaeological samples has renewed some of the earlier promises of the method and is worth further study to better understand how childhood stress impacts health throughout the life course. In this poster we present <b>vertebral</b> neural <b>canal</b> data from the late medieval rural population of Villamagna (n = 72) of central Italy. <b>Vertebral</b> neural <b>canals</b> were measured following standard protocols, with thoracic elements considered separately from lumbar ones as they complete growth at different stages in the life course. Statistical analyses demonstrate that smaller transverse canals in both thoracic and lumbar vertebrae are associated with earlier age-at-death, while anterior-posterior canal measures are not. An important implication of these findings is that stress likely occurred later in childhood and into early adolescence, instead of in infancy and early childhood. These data are also discussed in relation to other indicators of early life stress to explore some of the potential uses of the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease hypothesis in bioarchaeological research...|$|R

The complexity of anatomical variations {{can be related to}} the development of spinal cord arteries. The aim was to describe topography of Adamkiewicz artery and its relations to the anterior spi-nal artery in fetuses. The study was carried on 4 Batson’s resin corrosion casts and 24 formalin-fixed fetuses injected with dyed gelatin or latex aged 15 - 24 weeks gestational age. In fixed spec-imens <b>vertebral</b> <b>canals</b> were dissected, the anterior spinal artery was traced and Adamkiewicz artery localized. Arteries were photographed and digitally measured. Data were afterwards sta-tistically analyzed. Anterior spinal artery was duplicated in 3 / 28 cases. There were from 1 to 3 Adamkiewicz arteries per specimen, mean 1. 71. No relation was found between the number of Adamkiewicz artery and age. In 37 / 48 cases Adamkiewicz artery emptied into the anterior spi-nal artery on the left side. Mean degree of narrowing in anterior spinal artery (diameter of the anterior spinal artery above junction with Adamkiewicz artery divided by its diameter under that junction) was 76. 74 %.

40|$|Although the {{association}} between social inequality and poor adult health is well established, the mechanisms by which inequality is translated into poor adult health are less clear. Increasingly, evidence suggests that many adult health problems and health disparities have their origins in early life; the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis provides an explanatory mechanism linking adverse early life conditions with permanent structural or functional changes that increase the risk for disease. This hypothesis is consistent with bioarchaeological research noting reduced lifespan among individuals exhibiting signs of childhood stress. The principal aim of this dissertation is to contribute a bioarchaeological perspective to health disparities research by investigating how health disparities can be measured and understood in the past. This study focuses on early life conditions {{as a source of}} adult health disparity by examining a skeletal sample for {{the association}} between childhood stress and adult longevity; the relationship between childhood stress and the presence of adult health conditions; and sex, ancestry, and regional differences in these relationships. The study sampled 830 age-documented, U. S. born African American males and females and Euro-American males from the Terry and the Hamann-Todd anatomical collections, representing socially-marginalized individuals from the late 19 th- to early 20 th centuries. Enamel hypoplasia, femoral length, and <b>vertebral</b> neural <b>canal</b> diameters represented childhood stress; skeletal fractures, tibial periostosis, and the diseased, missing, and filled tooth index represented adult health. Longevity was modeled with Kaplan-Meier survival curves and adult health relationships were modeled with logistic regression. Additionally, cause of death data from historic health department publications and the study sample morgue records were examined for disparity in the epidemiological transition from infectious to degenerative cause of death. The study found mixed results for all analyses. There was no reduction in longevity for the presence of enamel hypoplasia, short femoral length, or reduced thoracic neural canal diameter. African American males had statistically significant reduced longevity for small lumbar <b>vertebral</b> neural <b>canal</b> diameters. African American males from the Hamann-Todd Collection and Euro-American males from both collections had significant relationships between <b>vertebral</b> neural <b>canal</b> diameters and adult conditions; these relationships varied among the groups but in most cases demonstrated reduced odds for having the adult condition for individuals with smaller canal diameters. African American females had no differential survival or relationships between variables over the lifecourse. All groups except for the Terry Collection Euro-American males continued to have more infectious disease deaths than degenerative disease deaths. The study results contribute to disparities research by demonstrating that the consequences of childhood stress varied by sex and ancestry and by demonstrating within-population variation in timing of the epidemiological transition. Additionally, the study results support the contention of greater male sensitivity to environmental conditions and contributes evidence supporting the DOHaD hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|A new partial {{skeleton}} of Homo erectus {{attributed to the}} D 2700 cranium was recently discovered {{at the site of}} Dmanisi, Georgia. Two cervical, two thoracic, and one lumbar vertebra are among these remains, and are also attributed to this individual. The vertebrae represent the oldest known vertebral series for this taxon, and are the oldest known outside of Africa. Because elements from each spinal region are represented, including never before seen cervical elements for this species, these fossils provide an important look at the axial {{skeleton of}} Homo erectus. ^ The fossils were compared 2257 individual vertebrae from modern humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and fossil hominids to assess the morphological and functional structure of the Dmanisi vertebrae and associated spinal cord. ^ Although the vertebrae correlate with a stature of only 1. 39 meters (42 ̆ 6 feet; 72 ̆ 6 inches;), the Dmanisi vertebrae reveal key changes relative to earlier small-bodied hominids, with an anatomy for efficient long-range travel and an increased ability to bear compressive loads. Hominid range expansion beyond the African continent is, therefore, associated with not only a shift in subsistence pattern, but also with development of the ability to travel long distances with children (both in utero and in infancy). ^ Both raw and relative values reveal that the Dmanisi spinal cord in all vertebral regions would have been fully modern in its shape and size. This contrasts with previous studies suggesting that brain evolution outpaced spinal cord evolution in the hominid lineage. The anomalous Nariokotome Homo erectus vertebrae appear to reflect pathology related to infant malnutrition, explaining why its <b>vertebral</b> <b>canals</b> and associated spinal cord size small, approximating australopithecine and chimpanzee values. ^ These results imply that early Homo erectus departed from the ancestral continent with a postcranial neurological substrate affording high potential for throwing projectiles accurately, and for highly coordinated manual tasks, relative to their australopithecine predecessors. Moreover, this study shows that Homo erectus would have had no postcranial neuromuscular restrictions on its ability to control respiration, and, as such, possessed a fully human postcranial anatomy associated with control and coordination of respiratory muscles for spoken language. ...|$|R

This study was designed to radiologically determine the minimum lateral angulations of the screw to avoid penetration of the vertebral artery canalusing three of the most common techniques: Roy-Camille, An, and Magerl. Materials and Methods: Sixty normal cervical CT scans were reviewed. A minimum lateral angulation of a 3. 5 mm lateral mass screw which was required to avoid penetration of the <b>vertebral</b> artery <b>canal</b> at each level of vertebra were measured. Results: The mean lateral angulations of the lateral mass screws (with 95 % confidence interval) to avoid <b>vertebral</b> artery <b>canal</b> penetration, in relation to the starting point at the midpoint (Roy-Camille), 1 mm medial (An), and 2 mm medial (Magerl) to the midpoint of lateral mass were 6. 8 ° (range, 6. 3 - 7. 4 °), 10. 3 ° (range, 9. 8 - 10. 8 °), and 14. 1 ° (range, 13. 6 - 14. 6 °) at C 3 vertebrae; 6. 8 ° (range, 6. 2 - 7. 5 °), 10. 7 ° (range, 10. 0 - 11. 5 °), and 14. 1 ° (range, 13. 4 - 14. 8 °) at C 4 vertebrae; 6. 6 ° (range, 6. 0 - 7. 2 °), 10. 1 ° (range, 9. 3 - 10. 8 °), and 13. 5 ° (range, 12. 8 - 14. 3 °) at C 5 vertebrae and 7. 6 ° (range, 6. 9 - 8. 3 °), 10. 9 ° (range, 10. 3 - 11. 6 °), and 14. 3 ° (range, 13. 7 - 15. 0 °) at C 6 vertebrae. The recommended lateral angulations for Roy-Camille, Magerl, and An are 10 °, 25 °,and 30 °, respectively. Statistically, there is a higher risk of vertebral foramen violation with the Roy-Camille technique at C 3, C 4 and C 6 levels, P < 0. 05.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} biocultural change in vertebrae from Dickson Mounds. Dickson underwent a transition from hunting and gathering (PreMississippian) to greater reliance on maize (Middle Mississippian) between A. D. 950 - 1300. Previous {{research has found that}} with this transition health declined markedly. However, vertebrae have unique growth patterns which permit inference into health not possible using traditional paleopepidemiological techniques. ^ <b>Vertebral</b> <b>canals</b> are mature by age five, while vertebral heights continue to grow past adolescence. Thus, depending on the duration of growth disruption, canals may be stunted without smaller heights. The brain and thymicolymphatic system also develop by age five, and small canals in the adult may be associated with morbidity and decreased life expectancy. Lumbar and thoracic vertebrae (n = 1, 073), from 91 individuals (ages 15 - 55), as well as tibiae (n = 30), were analyzed for various aspects of their covariation within age, sex, and cultural groups. ^ Results indicated that Mississippians, compared to PreMississippians, (combined sexes) had significantly decreased canal size, while their vertebral heights significantly increased. In PreMississippians, no difference in canal size was found between males and females. Males had larger heights. In Mississippians, females, compared to males, had significantly smaller canals and heights. Mississippian females, compared to PreMississippian females, had significantly smaller canals and heights. Mississippian males, compared to PreMississippian males, had smaller canals, but their heights increased. Small canal size was significantly associated with vertebral wedging. Wedging (anterior divided by posterior vertebral height) was used as a conservative measure of cancellous bone loss. Wedging cannot occur unless the cortical shell breaks down, and cancellous bone loss always precedes cortical loss. Harris lines, composed of cancellous bone, were significantly inversely correlated with wedging. This suggested that more cancellous bone in the tibiae was positively associated with more cancellous bone in the vertebral body. Lines were also consistently associated with larger tibial and vertebral morphometrics. Therefore, the use of adult Harris lines as indicators of morbidity must be reconsidered. Vertebral analysis offers important new insights into biocultural change at Dickson. Mississippian males apparently enjoyed better postnatal health compared to PreMississippian males. Females in the Mississippian declined in both prenatal and postnatal health. Clinical implications in modern populations are also discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates bone {{maintenance}} and loss within a life course perspective in the Imperial Roman population of Velia. The use of biocultural factors, such as diet, reproductive history {{and physical activity}} are emphasized in the interpretive process. A total of 135 individuals were examined. Bone loss is assessed using three methods: radiogrammetry of the 2 nd metacarpal, rib cortical histomorphometry, and the analysis of trabecular architecture in L 4 vertebrae. Physiological stress in adults is explored using porotic hyperostosis, cribra orbitalia and periostitis. Stress during growth and development is investigated through dental enamel hypoplasias, <b>vertebral</b> neural <b>canal</b> sizes and skeletal growth profiles of juvenile skeletons. Analyses of bone of {{maintenance and}} loss reveal that bone loss in the Velia population did not follow similar patterns to modern communities. The most meaningful difference was that no sex differences were observed {{between males and females}} for all three measures of bone maintenance and loss. In addition, the analyses of radiogrammetry, histomorphometry and trabecular architecture all support a hypothesis that strenuous physical activity over the life course helped mediate bone loss with age, particularly in females. The reproductive history of females in the Roman period is also hypothesized to have played a protective role in mediating bone loss. Physiological stress was common in the juvenile and adult stages of life, but this stress did not seemingly affect bone remodeling and loss with age or between the sexes. The approaches used in this dissertation advance bioarchaeological theory by implementing a life course perspective that emphasize developmental plasticity to investigating bone loss. This study also contributes methodologically by demonstrating the importance of using multiple lines of evidence when exploring bone loss in past populations...|$|R

40|$|To {{reconstruct}} highly destructed unstable {{rheumatoid arthritis}} (RA) cervical lesions, {{the authors have}} been using C 1 / 2 transarticular and cervical pedicle screw fixations. Pedicle screw fixation and C 1 / 2 transarticular screw fixation are biomechanically superior to other fixation techniques for RA patients. However, due to severe spinal deformity and small anatomical size of the vertebra, including the lateral mass and pedicle, in the most RA cervical lesions, these screw fixation procedures are technically demanding and pose the potential risk of neurovascular injuries. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the accuracy and safety of cervical pedicle screw insertion to the deformed, fragile, and small RA spine lesions using computer-assisted image-guidance systems. A frameless, stereotactic image-guidance system that is CT-based, and optoelectronic was used for correct screw placement. A total of 21 patients (16 females, 5 males) with cervical disorders due to RA were surgically treated using the image-guidance system. Postoperative computerized tomography and plane X-ray was used to determine the accuracy of the screw placement. Neural and vascular complications associated with screw insertion and postoperative neural recovery were evaluated. Postoperative radiological evaluations revealed that only 1 (2. 1 %; C 4) of 48 screws inserted into the cervical pedicle had perforated the <b>vertebral</b> artery <b>canal</b> more than 25 % (critical breach).

A {{female dog}} was referred presenting neurological signs of proprioceptive ataxy, proprioceptive {{deficit in the}} right pelvic limb, mild ambulatory paresis and spinal pain during the palpation in thoracic vertebrae. It was observed a right extradural compression of spinal cord over fourth and fifth thoracic vertebrae by spinal myelography. During necropsy evaluation, it was observed a neoplasm which infiltrated in the spinal canal in {{the fourth and fifth}} thoracic vertebrae with marked compression of the spinal cord. Microscopically there were well differentiated neoplasic adipocytes, with areas of spindle cells, diagnosed as infiltrative spindle cell lipoma. The immunohistochemical staining revealed positive CD 34 cells mainly in the areas of spindle cells lipoma...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to describe the technique, accuracy of placement and complications of transpedicular C 2 screw fixation without spinal navigation. Patients treated by C 2 pedicle screw fixations were identified from the surgical log book of the department. Clinical data were extracted retrospectively from the patients’ charts. Pedicle screw placement accuracy was assessed on postoperative CT scans according to Gertzbein and Robbins (GRGr). A total of 27 patients were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 56  ±  22. 0  years; 51. 9 % of them were female. As much as 17 patients suffered from trauma, 5 of degenerative disease, 3 of inflammations and 2 of metastatic disease. A total of 47 C 2 transpedicular screw fixations were performed. The canulated screws were inserted under visual control following the preparation of the superior surface of the isthmus and of the medial surface of the pedicles of the C 2. Intraoperative fluoroscopy was additionally used. The postoperative CT findings showed in 55. 3 % GRGr 1, in 27. 7 % GRGr 2, in 10. 6 % GRGr 3, and in 6. 3 % GRGr 4 pedicle screw insertion accuracy. Screw insertions GRGr 5 were not observed. Screw malpositioning (i. e., GRGr 3 and 4) was significantly associated with thin (< 5  mm) pedicle diameters and with surgery for C 2 fractures. In the three patients with screw insertions GRGr 4, postoperative angiographies were performed to exclude vertebral artery affections. In one of these three cases, the screw caused a clinically asymptomatic vertebral artery compression. Hardware failures did not occur. In one patient, postoperative pneumonia resulted in the death of the patient. Careful patient selection and surgical technique is necessary to avoid vertebral artery injury in C 2 pedicle screw fixation without spinal navigation. A slight opening of the <b>vertebral</b> artery <b>canal</b> (Gertzbein and Robbins grade ≤ 3) does not seem to put the artery at risk. However, the high rate of misplaced screws when inserted without spinal navigation, despite the fact that no neurovascular injury occurred, supports the use of spinal navigation in C 2 pedicle screw insertions...|$|R
