5|$|The <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> dwarf sphaero, also {{referred}} to as the <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> dwarf gecko, was discovered in the summer of 1964 by biologist Richard Thomas during a collecting trip along the dry, wooded slopes of Virgin Gorda in the British <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands.</b> The holotype for Sphaerodactylus parthenopion, MCZ 77211, was an adult female collected on 12 August 1964 on a hillside above Pond Bay. A total of eight paratypes were collected on Virgin Gorda and used to describe the new species.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for Puerto Rico and the <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> late on November15, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later. By that time, Lenny was projected to move over Puerto Rico. After Lenny made its closest {{approach to the}} island, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on November17, which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands.</b> In Puerto Rico, the media maintained continuous coverage on the hurricane based on statements and warnings from the San Juan National Weather Service office. Based on the coverage, the public was well informed of the hurricane's threat to the island. Before the storm {{and as a result}} of its impact, around 4,700people evacuated to 191shelters. This included 1,190residents in Ponce who evacuated to 27schools, as well as 584people in western Puerto Rico. Officials closed all schools, banned the sale of alcohol, and ordered a freeze on the price of emergency supplies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated six medical assistance teams, three medical support teams, and two advance medical assessment units. The agency stored five days' worth of food in schools in the U.S. <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands.</b> Before the hurricane's arrival, U.S. <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> governor Charles Wesley Turnbull declared a state of emergency. In St. Croix, 309people rode out the storm in shelters. Officials opened eight shelters in the British <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands.</b> There, airlines and hotels assisted in evacuating tourists from the area.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Frances for the Leeward Islands {{during the afternoon}} of August 29, which was upgraded to a warning that night and expanded to include the islands of Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda, Nevis, Saba, Saint Kitts, Sint Eustatius, and Sint Maarten. A hurricane watch was issued during the night of August 29 for the northern British <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands,</b> the northern United States <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands,</b> Culebra, and Vieques. On the morning of August 30, the hurricane watch for Vieques was downgraded to a {{tropical storm}} watch. That afternoon, hurricane watches were changed to tropical storm warnings across Puerto Rico, Culebra, Vieques, British <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands,</b> and the northern U. S. <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> while a tropical storm watch was issued for St. Croix while all remaining hurricane watches were dropped. That night, tropical storm watches were issued for eastern portions of the northern coast of the Dominican Republic while a tropical storm warning was issued for Guadeloupe.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> dwarf sphaero or <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> dwarf gecko (Sphaerodactylus parthenopion) is {{a species}} of gecko and {{also one of the}} {{smallest}} terrestrial vertebrates. It has only been found on three of the British Virgin Islands: Virgin Gorda, Tortola, and Moskito Island (also spelled “Mosquito Island”). It was discovered in 1964 and is suspected to be a close relative of Sphaerodactylus nicholsi, a dwarf sphaero from the nearby island of Puerto Rico. It shares its range with the big-scaled least gecko (S.macrolepis), which is found in leaf litter. Unlike this larger gecko, the <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> dwarf sphaero lives on drier hillsides, yet prefers moist microhabitats found under rocks because it lacks the adaptations necessary for preventing water loss, which is a significant problem due to its small body size.|$|E

5|$|Too little {{data has}} been {{gathered}} {{to assess the}} population size and trend of the <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> dwarf sphaero. It has been reported as “moderately common”, although difficult to find because of its size and ability to blend into its surroundings. Its distribution across the British <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> seems to be limited, and development may affect it further.|$|E

About {{a month after the}} storm passed, President Ronald Reagan declared the U.S. <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> a major disaster area. The declaration permitted use of federal funds for recovery. The Federal Emergency Management Agency provided an average relief fund of $2,128 (1984USD, $4,147 2006USD) per affected person, the smallest return rate for a declared disaster in the <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands.</b>|$|E

5|$|Originally {{found only}} {{on the island of}} Virgin Gorda, it has since been {{reported}} on Tortola and Moskito Island. Its range is sometimes estimated to encompass the entire British <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands,</b> although the original expedition by Thomas did not find any specimens on Tortola, Anegada, or other smaller islands, nor in the United States <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> of Saint Croix, Saint Thomas, and Saint John. Its distribution is considered unusual because despite being separated from its closest relative, S.nicholsi in Puerto Rico, another species, the Puerto Rican Crested Toad (Bufo lemur), has a geographic range that includes both islands, yet it has not diverged.|$|E
5|$|Saint John in the United States <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> {{reported}} over 15inches (380mm) {{of rainfall}} {{in association with}} Tropical Storm Klaus. Both Saint Thomas and Saint Croix received around 10inches (250mm), while rainfall in the British <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> remained below 10inches (250mm). Tropical Storm Klaus caused severe flooding and extensive damage throughout the U.S. <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands.</b> Strong southwesterly winds resulted in gale force winds and rough seas along the southwestern portions of the Leeward Islands. The rough waves caused considerable damage to marine interests in the area. In Anguilla, three ships were wrecked. 1mile (1.6km) off of Saint Martin, the rough seas wrecked a cruise ship. The 60 passengers and 23 crew members swam safely to shore, though one person was hospitalized. Rough seas also damaged local coral reefs. 10,000people were affected {{on the island of}} Dominica. There, the storm caused $2million (1984 USD, $3.9million 2006USD) in damage and resulted in two fatalities. In Antigua, strong waves from the hurricane produced severe beach erosion, which endangered a highway behind an eroded beach. Beach erosion was reported in nearby Barbuda, as well. The British <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> sustained moderate damage totaling to $152million (1984USD, $315million 2008USD). St. Kitts and Nevis also saw much Leeward coastal damage resulting from the storm, the worst impact being the destruction of the Sandy Point town port in Saint Kitts.|$|E
5|$|The British <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> {{participated in}} seven summer Olympic games between {{its debut in}} the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

The number of British Virgin Islanders participating in the summer games, excluding 1996 and 1984, included four or less athletes, and until Tahesia Harrigan in Beijing, only included men. Harrigan was the first female athlete to participate {{on behalf of the}} British <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands,</b> and was its first female flagbearer. At Beijing, the British <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> were represented by two athletes, both in their twenties and both participating in track and field events: Eric Matthias and Tahesia Harrigan.

The British Virgin Islander delegation included two athletes in 2008 participating in two distinct events in one sport: discus thrower Eric Matthias and sprinter Tahesia Harrigan. Of the athletes, Harrigan was the flagbearer and the first female Olympian to participate on behalf of the British <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> in its entire history. Overall, Harrigan advanced to quarterfinals in her event, although neither athlete medaled.|$|E

Three Royal Caribbean cruise ships re-routed their paths to avoid the storm. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) representatives coordinated with local emergency management officials in the United States <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands</b> to determine if preparation necessities would be adequate, such as hospital usage, shelters, and sand bags.|$|E
