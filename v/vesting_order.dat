5000|$|The Court of Appeal {{overturned}} {{the ratio of}} In Re the Ninety-Mile Beach in its 2003 decision Ngati Apa v Attorney-General. The Court explicitly overruled the decision both on the preliminary point on the source of Aboriginal title and on the specific issues of statutory interpretation. Reaffirming the doctrine of native title established in R v Symonds, Chief Justice Elias stated: [...] The transfer of sovereignty did not affect customary property. They are interests preserved by the common law until extinguished in accordance with law. I agree that the legislation relied on in the High Court does not extinguish any Maori customary property in the seabed or foreshore. I agree with Keith and Anderson JJ and Tipping J that In Re the Ninety-Mile Beach was wrong in law {{and should not be}} followed. In Re the Ninety-Mile Beach followed the discredited authority of Wi Parata v Bishop of Wellington (1877) 3 NZ Jur (NS) SC 72, which was rejected by the Privy Council in Nireaha Tamaki v Baker 1901 AC 561. This is not a modern revision, based on developing insights since 1963. The reasoning the Court applied in In Re the Ninety-Mile Beach was contrary to other and higher authority and indeed was described at the time as “revolutionary”.Elias CJ explained the proper interpretation of the Harbours Acts: Such legislation, by its terms, applied to future grants. It did not disturb any existing grants. Indeed, substantial areas of seabed and foreshore had already passed into the ownership of Harbour Boards and private individuals by 1878. I agree with the conclusion of Keith and Anderson JJ that the legislation cannot properly be construed to have confiscatory effect. Although a subsequent <b>vesting</b> <b>order</b> after investigation under the Maori Affairs Act 1953 was “deemed” a Crown grant (s162), that was a conveyancing device only and applied by operation of law. It was not a grant by executive action. Only such grants from Crown land were precluded for the future by the legislation. More importantly, the terms of s150 are inadequate to effect an expropriation of Maori customary property.Elias CJ also noted that,Just as the investigation through the Maori Land Court of the title to customary land could not extinguish any customary property in contiguous land on shore beyond its boundaries, I consider that an investigation and grant of coastal land cannot extinguish any property held under Maori custom in lands below high water mark.|$|E

40|$|In 1943, at {{the height}} of World War II, the U. S. Patent Office, by the {{authorization}} of the Alien Property Custodian (APC), published 2, 964 pending patent applications that had been seized from nationals of enemy and enemy-occupied countries. This unusual act—only in 2001 did the USPTO begin publishing some pending patent applications—was prompted by the APC’s wartime mandate to make enemy technology available to American industry. During and after the war many of these applications were issued as patents assigned to the APC. However, up to 58 percent were abandoned, becoming, in effect, orphan documents. APC documents, although they resemble contemporary patents and are granted prior art status by the USPTO, are virtually unknown today, even among patent professionals. This two-part paper investigates the origins, history and profile of this unique collection of prior art documents.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a novel possible solution for people detection and estimation of their 3 D position in challenging shared environments. Addressing safety critical applications in industrial environments, {{we make the}} basic assumption that people wear reflective <b>vests.</b> In <b>order</b> to detect these vests and to discriminate them from other reflective material, we propose an approach based on a single camera equipped with an IR flash. The camera acquires pairs of images, one with and one without IR flash, in short succession. The images forming a pair are then {{related to each other}} through feature tracking, which allows to discard features for which the relative intensity difference is small and which are thus not believed to belong to a reflective vest. Next, the local neighbourhood of the remaining features is further analysed. First, a Random Forest classifier is used to discriminate between features caused by a reflective vest and features caused by some other reflective materials. Second, the distance between the camera and the vest features is estimated using a Random Forest regressor. The proposed system was evaluated in one indoor and two challenging outdoor scenarios. Our results indicate very good classification performance and remarkably accurate distance estimation especially in combination with the SURF descriptor, even under direct exposure to sunlight. ...|$|R

25|$|Strict {{enforcement}} of anti-arm laws {{which are in}} existence in Singapore since 1823 {{has resulted in a}} relatively disarmed society, where firearms-related crimes are rare.

With a lighted cigar they burned the letters I.W.W. on my buttocks; then they poured a can of tar over my head and, in the absence of feathers, rubbed sage-brush on my body. One of them attempted to push a cane into my rectum. Another twisted my testicles. They forced me to kiss the flag and sing The Star-Spangled Banner.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Surrogate {{motherhood}} is a {{very complex}} issue with many groups having <b>vested</b> interests. In <b>order</b> to measure attitudes specific to surrogacy a 20 -item Likert Scale with high reliability was developed through item analysis (N= 131, Part-whole correlation range 0. 749 - 0. 478). Correlation of surrogacy attitudes was subsequently related to six other instruments: AIDS, F-Scale, Dogmatism Scale, Inward/Outward Directedness, Abortion Scale, and Locus of Control Scale. Significant correlation (p= 0. 05) was demonstrated with Abortion Scale (0. 486, p= 0. 001), Dogmatism (- 0. 253, p= 0. 048) and F-Scale (- 0. 191, p= 0. 05). A general authoritarian view leads to negative views towards surrogacy. First a group of college psychology and sociology undergraduates were tested with the surrogacy scale (mean = 66. 7, s. d. = 11. 0). Then the surrogacy scale was given to a group known to disfavor surrogacy, i. e. Roman Catholics familiar with the church's teachings concerning surrogacy. This group demonstrated a more negative view of surrogacy (mean = 47. 1, s. d. = 8. 56) and markedly differed from other catholic groups who did not support the church's teachings (t= 6. 06, df= 10, p= 0. 005). Also the surrogacy instrument was administered to a group known to favor surrogacy, members or former members of a surrogacy support group, i. e. the Surrogate Foundation. This group was shown to have a strongly positive view of surrogacy (mean = 78. 63, s. d. = 5. 46) and differed greatly from Catholics who are familiar with the church's teachings and agreed with the teachings (t= 11. 1, df= 31, p= 0. 001).

40|$|The {{viability}} and {{desirability of}} conducting cost-benefit analysis of financial regulation {{is a subject}} of intense academic debate. Opponents claim that such analysis is feasible for environmental regulation but not for financial regulation because {{of the difference in}} the benefits that require monetization in the respective areas. This Article argues that the recent debate misses {{an important part of the}} problem. In large part, cost-benefit analysis of financial regulation cannot currently be performed successfully because of institutional shortcomings, not analytical difficulties. Compared to Executive Branch agencies, independent agencies, like the major financial regulatory agencies, lack the capacity to do cost-benefit analyses of acceptable quality. Fortunately, there are good Executive Branch models that could be exported to the financial regulatory agencies. In particular, the Financial Stability Oversight Council could implement a robust coordinating role diffusing macroeconomic expertise, learning from the experience of the Interagency Working Group set up to estimate the damage of one ton of carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, the President could extend to independent agencies his Executive <b>Order</b> <b>vesting</b> in the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs the responsibility to review significant federal regulations. Though no President has yet taken this step, in part because of fears of a congressional backlash, the time might now be ripe to do so. And, the financial regulatory agencies could learn from the experience of the Environmental Protection Agency in building significant economic expertise to aid the preparation of cost-benefit analyses. The Article also considers the role of judicial review. It takes issue with the influential argument that OIRA review can serve as an alternative to judicial review, showing that such an outcome would be inconsistent with settled principles of administrative law. But OIRA review can lead to more deferential judicial review, by serving as a signal that reviewing courts are likely to find reassuring...|$|R
40|$|M. A. South Africa has {{thousands}} of destitute children without families {{to care for}} them. The bulk of such children are, at this time, born to impoverished and destitute African women. Many such children have been abandoned. In {{the years to come}} we must in addition expect a huge influx of children whose parents have died from or become incapacitated by Aids. These children will also need families to care for them. Adoption is an effective way of creating permanent homes for these children. However, there is currently a dearth of prospective African adopters in the Gauteng Province. Numerous assumptions have been put forward to explain this problemsituation. Some people think that it may be related to traditional norms of the African culture which emphasize the importance of blood ties when it comes to family building. In traditional African culture it was inconceivable that blood ties could be extinguished, or that someone totally strange, let alone someone from a different clan, could parent your child. The majority of modern, western adoptions, involve the legal adoption of children who are not related in any way to the people adopting them. An adoption <b>order</b> <b>vests</b> the parental rights and duties in the adopters and is irrevocable. The adoption order extinguishes natural parental rights with respect to any other person vis-a'-vis the child. Mother cause for concern, is the fact that when African adopters legally adopt children, the majority tend to very secretative about the whole affair. They usually do not acknowledge the adopted child's biological origins because they wish to protect the child and themselves from a negative response by the general community. It is important to tell children they are adopted because children have a right to the truth about themselves. Enduring relationships are built on honesty, not deception. When there has been secrecy in a family about adoption, everyone suffers. The community has a responsibility to provide support and resources to families formed by adoption. Recognizing that support from the community for an adoption service will not be forthcoming unless the community is positively oriented towards such a service, this study seeks to explore and describe the contemporary attitudes of an African community towards the concept of modern, western adoption. The Soweto community is the largest African community in South African. In order to explore the attitudes of people in this community towards the concept of modern, western adoption, a descriptive survey has been conducted. A sample of 163 people was drawn from the Vista University and the Soweto Home for the Aged. A selfadministered questionnaire was used as the method for data collection. Although generalizations to the greater African population cannot be made because a non-probability sampling method was used in this study, findings indicate that the majority of community members in Soweto probably have a positive attitude towards the concept of modern, western adoption. It is hoped that this attitude will have a directive influence on their future behaviour. There must thus be an ongoing effort to expand adoption opportunities for African children in need of permanent homes and members of the community must be directly involved in these efforts...|$|R
40|$|Development has {{the general}} {{connotation}} of a structural improvement of people’s well being. In practice, however, it often affects the entitlement positions {{of those who}} have to sustain their daily livelihoods in a negative way. This happens particularly when decisions on development are taken by governments without any prior consultation, let alone participation of stakeholders. As a result they are likely to exert detrimental effects on people. Hence, instead of being the beneficiaries, people at the grassroots actually become victims. It is in such contexts that we have considered development as being a hazard. Here, the right to development might offer a possible protection. This right grants holders the entitlements to a ‘fair distribution of benefits’ and to ‘participation’. The entitlement to a fair distribution of benefits would seem to imply that a violation occurs when development does not deliver benefits for those affected or, perversely, harms the right-holders. The entitlement to participation entails that the process of development requires the involvement of the stakeholders. The United Nations General Assembly Declaration on the Right to Development proposes two distinct options: firstly, by stipulating a participatory environment process that is stimulated by the state, and secondly, by asserting actions from below, emphasizing a participatory activity that is, first and foremost, at the initiative of the right-holders themselves. The study has the effect of highlighting a lack of substantial people’s protection in development. To answer to this concern, the assumptions that the official and international consensus on the discourse of protection in development would lead to the proliferation and implementation at the grass-root level must be abandoned. Sound analyses should not start by excluding the need for a conception and harmonization of relevant values and practices at the national and local levels with the international discourse. In this study, we have argued that the lack of enforceability occurs particularly when one forces a positivist form of implementation upon the right to development, while hazards occur especially when development is executed from a determinist perspective. In the case of Indonesia, this appears in a phenomenon that the official endorsement of the right to development may imply not just a first step towards implementation but rather towards obstruction. In this concern, the finding of the study emphasizes that in order for the right to development to actually operate as a legal resource as well as a political instrument against hazards, all development actors should seek to be effective before aspiring to be successful and comprehensive in their efforts. In the ensuing processes of operationalization, painful political and economic compromises will have to be made against macro-development priorities and <b>vested</b> interests in <b>order</b> to ensure protection of the intended beneficiaries, in this study regarded as right-holders. Only in that respect that we can move from moral ends of development to a genuine right to development. While opening a new dialogue about using the right to development to combat development hazards, this book reveals the complex interface between human rights and development as actually practiced.
