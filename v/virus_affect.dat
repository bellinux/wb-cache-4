40|$|Chimeric simian/human {{immunodeficiency}} viruses (SHIVs) that {{express the}} env genes derived from distinct HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) isolates were {{tested for the}} ability to infect rhesus macaques following intravaginal inoculation. SHIVs containing either the HIV- 1 HXBc 2 or the HIV- 1 89. 6 envelope glycoproteins were capable of replicating in intravenously inoculated rhesus macaques. However, intravaginal inoculation of animals with these two SHIVs resulted in infection only with the SHIV containing the HIV- 1 89. 6 glycoprotein. Thus, properties conferred by the envelope glycoproteins in the chimeric <b>virus</b> <b>affect</b> the ability of particular SHIVs to initiate a systemic infection following vaginal inoculation. These results provide indirect support for the hypothesis that the selection of specific viral variants occurs in the genital tracts of individuals exposed to HIV by sexual contact...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which amino acid changes in the E 1 and E 2 surface glycoproteins of Sindbis <b>virus</b> <b>affect</b> neurovirulence is unknown. We have studied two recombinant viruses which differ in virulence. One (TE) contains Gly and the other (TES) contains Arg at position 172 in E 2. TE causes more rapid death than TES in newborn mice. Both viruses replicate similarly in nonneuronal cells, but TE replicates more rapidly in the brains of newborn mice and in neuroblastoma cells. TE also induces earlier viral RNA synthesis in neuroblastoma cells. 35 S-labeled TE binds more efficiently to brain and neuroblastoma cells, but not to nonneuronal cells, than TES. We propose that a region of the E 2 glycoprotein affected by the amino acid occupying position 172 is important for binding to an alphavirus receptor on neurons and influences neurovirulence by this mechanism...|$|E

Applying a bottom-up analytic process with the help of software for textual data, we investigated 19 interviews in order to describe the core themes and the latent factors of speech, to explore the role of different variables in shaping the participants’ illness experiences. The five themes detected are feeling different from others, body pain, acquisition of knowledge and resources, family history, and integration of care practices in everyday life. We illustrate how nationality, age, family situation, the use of prophylaxis or on-demand treatment, and the presence of human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C <b>virus</b> <b>affect</b> the experience of our participants in different ways. Findings are used to bring insights on research, clinical practice, and psychosocial support...|$|E

40|$|Pseudorabies virus (PRV) and {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) are distantly related alphaherpesviruses whose natural hosts are pigs and humans, respectively. Adult infections of natural hosts are mild and rarely lethal. However, both viruses are also able to infect other hosts, often with lethal effects. In this report, we use the {{paradigm}} of infection of a common permissive cell type and microarray analysis to determine if these two diverse alphaherpesviruses engage similar or different cellular pathways to obtain a common outcome: productive infection. We compared cellular gene expression in growth-arrested, primary rat embryonic fibroblasts that were mock infected or infected with either purified PRV-Becker or HSV- 1 (F). Infections by either <b>virus</b> <b>affect</b> the transcription of more than 1, 500 cellular genes by threefold or more. Few differences are detected early, {{and the majority of}} changes occur during the late stages of infection. Remarkably, the transcripts of about 500 genes are regulated in common, while the rest are regulated in a virus-specific manner. Genes whose expression is affected by infection fall into a diverse group of functional classes and cellular pathways. Furthermore, a comparison of the cellular response to HSV- 1 infection of primary human and rat fibroblasts revealed unexpected diversity in the transcript profiles...|$|E
40|$|Cross-protection {{has been}} used {{successfully}} and commercially to control a range of virus diseases for which the selection of suitable mild strains of plant viruses is necessary. Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) is highly pathogenic on Arabidopsis plants and its silencing suppressor-defective mutant, TCVCP, can induce highly localized RNA silencing which is {{differs from that of}} other protective strains. We found that TCVCP provides some protection against wild-type TCV but lacks complete protection, and the relative locations of the protective virus and challenge <b>virus</b> <b>affect</b> the degree of cross-protection. However, similar cross-protection afforded by TCVCP is not observed in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. As expected, TCVCP pre-infected Arabidopsis plants fail to protect against infection with the unrelated Cucumber mosaic virus, strain Fhy. It appears that cross-protection afforded by TCVCP requires that the challenge virus be very similar in sequence, which is a characteristic of RNA silencing. In order to investigate whether the protection is associated with the highly localized RNA silencing, mutant plants involved in key silencing pathway genes of RNA silencing machinery, including dcl 2, dcl 4 and triple dcl 2 /dcl 3 /dcl 4 mutants were used. The results demonstrate that cross-protection afforded by TCVCP is dependent on host RNA silencing, and both DCL 2 and DCL 4 play important roles in this process...|$|E
40|$|Some key {{questions}} in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) biology center on whether naturally occurring sequence {{differences in the}} <b>virus</b> <b>affect</b> infection or EBV associated diseases. Understanding the pattern of EBV sequence variation is also important for possible development of EBV vaccines. At present EBV isolates worldwide can be grouped into Type 1 and Type 2, a classification based on the EBNA 2 gene sequence. Type 1 EBV is the most prevalent worldwide but Type 2 is common in parts of Africa. Type 1 transforms human B cells into lymphoblastoid cell lines much more efficiently than Type 2 EBV. Molecular mechanisms that may account for this difference in cell transformation are now becoming clearer. Advances in sequencing technology will greatly {{increase the amount of}} whole EBV genome data for EBV isolated from different parts of the world. Study of regional variation of EBV strains independent of the Type 1 /Type 2 classification and systematic investigation of the relationship between viral strains, infection and disease will become possible. The recent discovery that specific mutation of the EBV EBNA 3 B gene may be linked to development of diffuse large B cell lymphoma illustrates the importance that mutations in the virus genome may have in infection and human disease...|$|E

40|$|Seasonal {{influenza}} outbreaks and pandemics of new {{strains of}} the influenza <b>virus</b> <b>affect</b> humans around the globe. However, traditional systems for measuring the spread of flu infections deliver results {{with one or two}} weeks delay. Recent research suggests that data on queries made to the search engine Google can be used to address this problem, providing real-time estimates of levels of influenza-like illness in a population. Others have however argued that equally good estimates of current flu levels can be forecast using historic flu measurements. Here, we build dynamic ‘nowcasting’ models; in other words, forecasting models that estimate current levels of influenza, before the release of official data one week later. We find that when using Google Flu Trends data in combination with historic flu levels, the mean absolute error (MAE) of in-sample ‘nowcasts’ can be significantly reduced by 14. 4 %, compared with a baseline model that uses historic data on flu levels only. We further demonstrate that the MAE of out-of-sample nowcasts can also be significantly reduced by between 16. 0 % and 52. 7 %, depending on the length of the sliding training interval. We conclude that, using adaptive models, Google Flu Trends data can indeed be used to improve real-time influenza monitoring, even when official reports of flu infections are available with only one week's delay...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of bioprocesses involving baculoviruses largely depends on an efficient infection of cells by concentrated budded virus (BV) inoculums. Baculovirus expression vector {{systems have been}} established using Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), a group I NPV that displays rapid virus kinetics, whereas bioprocesses using group II baculovirus-based biopesticides such as Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) have the limitation of low levels of BV, as these viruses often display poor BV production kinetics. In this study, the effect of key parameters involved {{in the quality of}} progeny virions, including cell line, virus phylogenetics and medium, on viral DNA replication, virus trafficking to the extracellular environment, and the yield of recombinant protein or polyhedra were investigated in synchronous infections of HearNPV and AcMNPV. HearNPV showed higher vDNA replication in its optimum medium, SF 900 III, when compared to AcMNPV, but both viruses had similar specific extracellular virion content. However, the ratio of AcMNPV extracellular virions to the total number of progeny virions produced was higher, and their quality was tenfold higher than that of HearNPV extracellular virions. The results of infection of two different cell lines, High Five and Sf 9, with AcMNPV, along with HearNPV infection of HzAM 1 cells in three different media, suggest that the host cells and the nutritional state of the medium as well as the phylogenetics of the <b>virus</b> <b>affect</b> the BV yields produced by different baculovirus/cell line/medium combinations...|$|E
40|$|The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV- 1) {{depends on}} {{interaction}} with many host factors {{for a successful}} replication and infection, however some interacting host factors {{are part of the}} host defense against invading viruses and are detrimental for the virus. Due to immune pressure, high viral turnover and error-prone nature of HIV- 1, changes in the dynamics of those interactions may occur and have consequences on biological properties of the virus and course of infection. In this thesis we studied the interaction of the HIV- 1 capsid with host factors and how changes in the <b>virus</b> <b>affect</b> these interactions, viral infectivity and disease progression. Here we studied the effect of mutations in viral capsid in the CypA-binding region on the biological properties of the virus. Furthermore, we analyzed whether HIV- 1 was able to adapt to replicate in the presence of rhTrim 5 α, and determined whether escape mutations only emerged in capsid or whether the virus could escape rhTrim 5 α-mediated restriction by introduction of amino acid changes in other viral proteins. Moreover, we studied the dynamics of mutations in HLA-B* 27 restricted epitopes in the viral capsid in HIV- 1 infected patients carrying this protective HLA-B* 27 allele, and analyzed whether viral escape was associated with disease progression. Additionally, the effect of genetic polymorphisms in host factor TREX 1 were analyzed with regard to HIV- 1 pathogenesis in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV- 1 and AIDS. Finally, these described findings are discussed in the light of current view how the HIV- 1 interaction with host factors is relevant in HIV- 1 infection and immune evasion...|$|E

40|$|A live {{attenuated}} influenza A/Vietnam/ 1203 / 2004 (H 5 N 1) {{vaccine virus}} (VN 04 ca) has receptor binding specificity to α 2, 3 -linked sialosides (α 2, 3 SAL), {{and a single}} dose induces a minimal serum antibody response in mice and ferrets. In contrast, A/Hong Kong/ 213 / 2003 (H 5 N 1) vaccine virus (HK 03 ca) binds to both α 2, 6 SAL and α 2, 3 SAL and generates a stronger serum antibody response in animals. Among the 9 amino acids that differed between the two H 5 HA 1 proteins, several HK 03 -specific residues enabled the VN 04 ca virus to bind to both α 2, 3 SAL and α 2, 6 SAL receptors, but only {{the removal of the}} 158 N glycosylation, together with an S 227 N change, resulted in more-efficient viral replication in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets and an increased serum antibody response. However, the antibody response was HK 03 strain specific and did not significantly cross-neutralize VN 04 virus. A second approach was taken to adapt the H 5 N 1 VN 04 ca virus in MDCK cells to select HA variants with larger plaque morphology. Although a number of large-plaque-size HA variants with amino acid changes in the HA receptor binding region were identified, none of these mutations affected virus receptor binding preference and immunogenicity. In addition, the known receptor binding site changes, Q 226 L and G 228 S, were introduced into the HA protein of the VN 04 ca virus. Only in conjunction with the removal of the 158 N glycosylation did the virus replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets and became more immunogenic, yet the response was also HK 03 specific. Thus, the mask of the antigenic epitopes by 158 N glycosylation at the HA globular head and its α 2, 3 SAL binding preference of VN 04 ca <b>virus</b> <b>affect</b> virus antigenicity and replication in the host, resulting in a lower antibody response...|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{feline leukemia virus}} (FeLV) have {{illustrated}} {{the importance of the}} genotype of the infecting virus in determining disease outcome. In FeLV infections, as in other retroviral infections, it is less clear how virus variants that evolve from the transmitted <b>virus</b> <b>affect</b> pathogenesis. We previously reported an analysis of the genotypic changes that occur in the viral envelope gene (env) in cats infected with a prototype transmissible FeLV clone, 61 E (J. Rohn, M. Linenberger, E. Hoover, and J. Overbaugh, J. Virol. 68 : 2458 – 2467, 1994). In one cat, each variant (81 T) had evolved, in addition to scattered amino acid changes, a four-amino-acid insertion with respect to 61 E. This insertion was located at the same site in the extracellular envelope glycoprotein where the immunodeficiency-inducing molecular clone 61 C possesses a six-amino-acid insertion critical for its pathogenic phenotype, although the sequences of the insertions were distinct. To determine whether acquisition of the four-amino-acid insertion was associated with a change in the replication or cytopathic properties of the virus, we constructed chimeras encoding 81 T env genes in a 61 E background. One representative chimeric virus, EET(TE) - 109, was highly cytopathic {{despite the fact that it}} replicated with delayed kinetics in the feline T-cell line 3201 compared to the parental 61 E virus. The phenotype of this virus was also novel compared to other FeLVs, including both the parental virus 61 E and the immunodeficiency-inducing variant 61 C, because infection of T cells was associated with syncytium formation. Moreover, in single-cycle infection assays, the 81 T- 109 envelope demonstrated receptor usage properties distinct from those of both 61 E and 61 C envelope. Thus, these studies demonstrate the evolution of a novel T-cell cytopathic and syncytium-inducing FeLV in the host. The 81 T virus will be valuable for dissecting the mechanism of T-cell killing by cytopathic variants in the FeLV model...|$|E
