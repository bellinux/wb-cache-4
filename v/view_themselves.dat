5|$|Securely {{attached}} adults tend to {{have positive}} views of themselves, their partners and their relationships. They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They {{tend to be less}} trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. Dismissive-avoidant adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with rejection by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust their partners and <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.|$|E
5|$|Loyalty, fidelity, and {{betrayal}} are significant {{themes in the}} book, explored {{against the background of}} both planetary and interplanetary relations. Genly Ai is sent to Gethen as an envoy of the Ekumen, whose mission is to convince the various Gethenian nations that their identities will not be destroyed when they integrate with the Ekumen. At the same time, the planetary conflict between Karhide and Orgoreyn is shown as increasing nationalism, making it hard for those in each country to <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> as citizens of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Mental health {{consists}} of a broad scope of measurements of mental well being including depression, stress and measurements of self-worth. Numerous factors affect the prevalence of mental health disorders among women in India, including older age, low educational attainment, fewer children in the home, lack of paid employment and excessive spousal alcohol use. There is also {{evidence to suggest that}} disadvantages associated with gender increase the risk for mental health disorders. Women who find it acceptable for men to use violence against female partners may <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> as less valuable than men. In turn, this may lead women to seek out fewer avenues of healthcare inhibiting their ability to cope with various mental disorders.|$|E
50|$|The term ethnic Yugoslavs has {{referred}} to those who exclusively <b>viewed</b> <b>themselves</b> as Yugoslavs with no other ethnic self-identification.|$|R
50|$|Self-justification {{often comes}} into play when {{discussing}} why individuals make “immoral” decisions. To keep <b>viewing</b> <b>themselves</b> in a positive light, individuals may rationalize unethical or corrupt decision-making using the aforementioned self-justification strategies.|$|R
5000|$|The goal of {{systemic}} development {{is to have}} community participants shift from being reactors to <b>viewing</b> <b>themselves</b> “as active participants in shaping their reality move from reacting to the present to creating the future” ...|$|R
5|$|Team {{effectiveness}} (also {{referred to}} as group effectiveness) is the capacity a team has to accomplish the goals or objectives administered by an authorized personnel or the organization. A team {{is a collection of}} individuals who are interdependent in their tasks, share responsibility for outcomes, and <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> as a unit embedded in an institutional or organizational system which operates within the established boundaries of that system. Teams and groups have established a synonymous relationship within the confines of processes and research relating to their effectiveness (i.e. group cohesiveness, teamwork) while still maintaining their independence as two separate units, as groups and their members are independent of each other's role, skill, knowledge or purpose versus teams and their members, who are interdependent upon each other's role, skill, knowledge and purpose.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi era {{continues}} to inform how Germans <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> and their country. Virtually every family suffered losses {{during the war}} or has a story to tell, though Germans kept quiet about their experiences and {{felt a sense of}} communal guilt, even if they were not directly involved in war crimes. Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school curriculum starting in the 1970s, as people began researching the experiences of their family members. Study of the era and a willingness to critically examine its mistakes has {{led to the development of}} a strong democracy in today's Germany, but with lingering undercurrents of antisemitism and neo-Nazi thought.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E
50|$|The G8 (reformatted as G7 from 2014 due to Russia's suspension) was an inter-governmental {{political}} forum from 1997 untill 2014, with participation {{from the}} world′s major highly industrialized economies {{in countries that}} <b>viewed</b> <b>themselves</b> as democracies.|$|R
5000|$|... Instead of <b>viewing</b> <b>themselves</b> as a {{collection}} of individuals from different nationalities, countries and backgrounds, students embrace the concept of a world-wide culture of Latinos tied together by a commonality of historical events, experiences, and language.|$|R
50|$|Adventists <b>viewed</b> <b>themselves</b> as {{heirs of}} earlier outcast believers {{such as the}} Waldenses, Protestant Reformers {{including}} the Anabaptists, English and Scottish Puritans, evangelicals of the 18th century including Methodists, Seventh Day Baptists, and others who rejected established church traditions.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{a decline}} in social {{mobility}} for those of less prominent clans, the local elites became far more integrated into a nationwide upper class social structure during the Eastern Han period, thus expanding the classification of who belonged to the upper class. The emerging gentry class—which became fully consolidated during the Eastern Han—consisted of unemployed scholars, teachers, students, and government officials. These men, although geographically separated and mired in local activities, started to <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> as participants in wider national affairs of politics and scholarship. They recognized shared values of filial piety, deference, and emphasizing study in the Five Classics over holding public office. Emperors Yuan and Cheng were forced to abandon their resettlement schemes for officials and their families around the royal tombs settlement in 40 BCE and 15 BCE, respectively; unlike the days of Emperor Wu, historian Cho-Yun Hsu asserts {{that at this point}} officials and scholars had so much influence in both local and national-level politics that to forcibly relocate them became unthinkable.|$|E
25|$|During the Palestinian Arab {{national}} movement's formation, Bedouins often {{perceived their}} tribe as their principal focus of identity, and they generally did not <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> {{as a component}} of the emerging Palestinian identity.|$|E
25|$|Dutch {{society is}} egalitarian, individualistic and modern. The {{people tend to}} <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> as modest, {{independent}} and self-reliant. They value ability over dependency. The Dutch have an aversion to the non-essential.|$|E

60|$|A savorless people, gulping {{tasteless}} food, {{and sitting}} afterward, coatless and thoughtless, in rocking-chairs prickly with inane decorations, listening to mechanical music, saying mechanical {{things about the}} excellence of Ford automobiles, and <b>viewing</b> <b>themselves</b> as the greatest race in the world.|$|R
25|$|The bop {{revival of}} the 1970s renewed {{interest}} in bop scat singing, and young scat singers <b>viewed</b> <b>themselves</b> as {{a continuation of the}} classic bop tradition. The medium continues to evolve, and vocal improvisation now often develops independently of changes in instrumental jazz.|$|R
25|$|Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch {{claim that}} Uyghur resentment of 'cultural repression' {{is the cause}} of ethnic riots in Xinjiang. Some Han Chinese opponents of the {{movement}} <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> as receiving second-class treatment by PRC policies regulating ethnic autonomy.|$|E
25|$|If both Islam and Christianity <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> as {{universal}} and missionary, {{it does not}} mean an impasse but an opportunity to search further into the mystery of that faith to see how it resonates and relates to the other's faith.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that men largely <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> as ‘passive’ {{contributors}} since they have ‘less physical involvement' in IVF treatment. Despite this, many men feel distressed after seeing the toll of hormonal injections and ongoing physical intervention on their partner.|$|E
50|$|An added {{complication}} is {{that one}} or both partners involved in a workplace romance may be married or in a relationship outside of the workplace. Co-workers aware of an adulterous workplace relationship may become uncomfortable, <b>viewing</b> <b>themselves</b> as party to the deceit.|$|R
50|$|The painting's {{variable}} interpretations (especially as an admonishing {{lesson on}} pride) are now considered valuable {{example of how}} the Welsh <b>viewed</b> <b>themselves,</b> and their rural nonconformist past in the twentieth century.

5000|$|The Rovčani tribe had {{historically}} <b>viewed</b> <b>themselves</b> as Serbs, and {{in light}} of Montenegrin independence (2006), Rovca clan chief Nikola Minić said that [...] "If Milo Djukanovic tried to divide Montenegro... we wouldn't live in his country... but remain united in a brotherhood with Serbia." ...|$|R
25|$|After Simpson's {{death in}} 1919, the C distanced itself from Pentecostalism, rejecting {{the premise that}} {{speaking}} in tongues is a necessary indicator of being filled with the Holy Spirit, and instead focused on the deeper Christian life. By 1930, most local branches of the C functioned as churches, but still did not <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> as such.|$|E
25|$|Nor did the humanists <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> as in {{conflict}} with Christianity. Some, like Salutati, were the Chancellors of Italian cities, but the majority (including Petrarch) were ordained as priests, and many worked as senior officials of the Papal court. Humanist Renaissance popes Nicholas V, Pius II, Sixtus IV, and Leo X wrote books and amassed huge libraries.|$|E
25|$|How {{individuals}} <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> ultimately determines {{who they}} are, their abilities {{and what they}} can be. Having both too low of self-esteem as well as too high of one can be detrimental to an individual's mental health. A person's self-esteem plays a much larger role in their overall happiness and quality of life. Poor self-esteem whether it be too high or too low can result in aggression, violence, self-deprecating behavior, anxiety, and other mental disorders.|$|E
5000|$|The student protests {{provoked}} {{supporters of}} the Vietnam War and the Nixon Administration to demonstrate in their own right. In contrast to the noisy student protests, Administration supporters <b>viewed</b> <b>themselves</b> as [...] "the Silent Majority" [...] (a phrase coined by Nixon speechwriter Patrick Buchanan).|$|R
50|$|This Achaeanizing {{provoked}} the Dorians living in Messenia. They <b>viewed</b> <b>themselves</b> as dominant over the Achaeans by right of conquest. They were supported {{in this view}} by Sparta, which had maintained a successful Dorian enclave, eventually achieving ascendance over the Achaeans in the Eurotas valley, who became the perioeci.|$|R
5000|$|Judaism {{has been}} {{compared}} with Brahminism by Osho Rajneesh and Steven Rosen in their books. They cite the similarities between Brahmins and Jews who <b>viewed</b> <b>themselves</b> as [...] "God's chosen people." [...] Rosen adds that Brahmins had a [...] "community of priests" [...] while Jews had a [...] "Kingdom of Priests".|$|R
25|$|Quakers, or Friends, {{are members}} of a family of {{religious}} movements collectively known as the Religious Society of Friends. The central unifying doctrine of these movements is the priesthood of all believers. Many Friends <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> as members of a Christian denomination. They include those with evangelical, holiness, liberal, and traditional conservative Quaker understandings of Christianity. Unlike many other groups that emerged within Christianity, the Religious Society of Friends has actively tried to avoid creeds and hierarchical structures.|$|E
25|$|Ahmadi thought {{emphasizes}} {{the belief that}} Islam is the final dispensation for humanity as revealed to Muhammad {{and the necessity of}} restoring to it its true essence and pristine form, which had been lost through the centuries. Ahmadiyya adherents believe that Ahmad appeared in the likeness of Jesus, to end religious wars, condemn bloodshed and reinstitute morality, justice, and peace. They believe that upon divine guidance he divested Islam of fanatical and innovative beliefs and practices by championing what is, in their view, Islam’s true and essential teachings as practised by Muhammad and the early Islamic community. Thus, Ahmadis <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> as leading the revival and peaceful propagation of Islam.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, {{we believe}} that {{individuals}} like to <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> as noble by offering help. This concept {{is related to the}} notion of self-awareness. If it is true that people focus on the impression they make on others, then public-awareness through the use of accountability cues can stimulate people to give help to each other. However, being surrounded by a lot of bystanders does not automatically create public self-awareness. In fact, in some cases being surrounded by bystanders allows an individual to hide within the crowd and feel anonymous. According to Dr. van Bommel, by introducing an accountability cue, the aim is to eliminate feelings of anonymity and increase the likelihood of them offering help.|$|E
5000|$|On {{a trip to}} New York in 1926, Haines met James [...] "Jimmie" [...] Shields, {{possibly}} as a pick-up on the street. Haines convinced Shields to move to Los Angeles, promising to get him work as an extra. The pair were soon living together and <b>viewed</b> <b>themselves</b> as a committed couple.|$|R
50|$|Some Jewish Israelis of Eastern European descent, known also as Ashkenazim, {{have been}} {{described}} as <b>viewing</b> <b>themselves</b> as superior to Sephardim and non-Ashkenazi Jews generally.
