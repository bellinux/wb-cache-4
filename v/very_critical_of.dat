5|$|Lamason was {{not afraid}} to speak his mind. On the night of 30/31 March 1944, when 795 bombers were sent to attack Nuremberg, he was <b>very</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the route chosen, warning his station {{commander}} that heavy losses could be expected. On the moonlit night, 95 bombers were lost, its heaviest losses of the entire war during a single raid.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} he joined Mihailović in northeastern Bosnia, Đurišić was <b>very</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Mihailović's leadership, and argued {{strongly}} for all the remaining Chetnik troops {{to move to the}} area of the Ljubljana Gap in modern-day Slovenia. At this point Ostojić and Baćović were also questioning Mihailović's plans. When Mihailović remained unconvinced, Đurišić decided to move to the Ljubljana Gap independent of Mihailović, and arranged for Dimitrije Ljotić's forces already in the Ljubljana Gap to meet him near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist his movement. When he left Mihailović, he was joined by Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić and the Chetnik detachments commanded by Ostojić and Baćović as well as a large number of refugees.|$|E
5|$|He {{contends that}} the {{presentation}} of the Quran and its suras was dictated by Muhammad and that the task of Abu Bakr was to collect the Quran between its two covers and transcribe it into one copy, while Uthman's task was to fix the transcription and unify it to prevent variant readings. He also expresses doubts that Ali, as it is alleged, had made a chronologically arranged collection. Darwaza was <b>very</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> other modern interpreters who used certain verses of the Quran to deduce and support scientific theories. He argues that those people have done harm to Islam by trivializing the sacred character of the Quran.|$|E

5|$|Baćović joined Đurišić's {{forces in}} their trek towards Slovenia, {{alongside}} Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić, detachments commanded by Ostojić, {{and a large}} number of refugees, totaling around 10,000. This force was formed into the Chetnik 8th Montenegrin Army, consisting of the 1st, 5th, 8th and 9th (Herzegovina) divisions. Earlier, Đurišić and Mihailović had argued over the best course of action. Đurišić had wanted to withdraw through Albania to Greece, but Mihailović had told him to prepare for an Allied landing, the return of the king and the establishment of a national government. From the time Đurišić joined Mihailović in northeastern Bosnia, he was <b>very</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Mihailović's leadership and argued strongly for all remaining Chetnik troops to move to Slovenia. When Mihailović remained unconvinced, Đurišić decided to move to Slovenia independently of him, and arranged for Dimitrije Ljotić's Serbian Volunteer Corps already in Slovenia to meet him near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist his movement.|$|E
5|$|Between 1974 and 1977, Boycott {{elected to}} make himself {{unavailable}} for England. He claimed in 2006 that he had simply lost his appetite for Test cricket and the stress became too much for him. Boycott's biographer, McKinstry, speculates that the self-imposed exile {{may also have been}} linked to the appointments of Mike Denness and then Tony Greig to the England captaincy, in preference to Boycott. Boycott was <b>very</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Denness's captaincy and his standard of batting in his autobiography in 1987, citing it as a factor in his decision, along with the pressures at Yorkshire. His weak immune system was a recurring motivation for not touring the Indian subcontinent. This period of exile coincided with the peaks of several fast bowlers' careers, including Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Andy Roberts, and Michael Holding. However, he later came back to face the West Indies pace battery at its most fearsome in the late 70s and early 80s.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{continued}} {{to be used as}} the county gaol after the war and in 1653 a new gaol, built from stone and brick, was constructed in the castle grounds. In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard inspected the gaol and was <b>very</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the facility. In particular he complained about the castle's underground dungeon, accessed down a flight of 26 steps; the room was circular, 18 feet (5.5 m) across, and guarded by an iron grill. Worcester conducted extensive work after the report at a cost of £3,431 (£364,000 at 2009 prices), and by 1788 the prison had 18 new cells for men and two for women, in addition to the dungeon and the sick-rooms. Nevertheless, it was housing 74 inmates at the time of Howard's inspection, with two prisoners routinely sharing each cell, sleeping together on the floor. Like other prisons of the time, Worcester Castle was run as a private enterprise, in this case by a local butcher, who was paid £150 a year (£15,400) to run the facility. The prison was known to suffer from outbreaks of gaol fever, which claimed the life of a local doctor who visited the facility.|$|E

5|$|With about 700 German and 1,300 Ottoman {{soldiers}} of the 16th and 19th Divisions, von Oppen succeeded in retreating towards Beisan via Mount Ebal during 21 September but {{was forced to leave}} behind all guns or baggage. They suffered some casualties when fired on by artillery, before bivouacking that night at Tammun with the 16th and 19th Divisions at Tubas, unaware that Desert Mounted Corps had already occupied Beisan. They were moving northwards from Tubas towards Beisan when von Oppen learned it had already been captured. He decided to advance during the night of 22 September to Samakh where he correctly guessed Liman von Sanders would order a strong rearguard action. However, Jevad, the commander of the Eighth Army ordered him to cross the Jordan instead; he successfully got all the Germans and some of the Ottoman soldiers across before the 11th Cavalry Brigade attacked and captured the remainder, to finalise the capture of Afulah and Beisan. Liman von Sanders was <b>very</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Jevad's intervention which considerably weakened the Samakh position, but von Oppen would have had to break through a whole cavalry division to get there.|$|E
5|$|Minutes {{before the}} race start, reports of rain falling on the track caused the start to be delayed by around ten minutes. Race control {{eventually}} deemed the race to be dry enough {{to be called a}} dry race, thus the rain tyres were not necessary, but would be required later in the race. Dario Franchitti and Alex Tagliani led the field to the line, with the circuit still being dusty from the previous night's repair work. Dust clouds engulfed the start-finish straight, blinding many of the midfield runners. The top five runners managed to negotiate the first chicane cleanly, while behind, half a dozen cars were involved in a first-corner crash. Takuma Sato misjudged his braking into the first corner and clipped the rear of Will Power's Penske machine, which spun him into Scott Dixon. Hélio Castroneves could not avoid running into Dixon's stationary car at the first corner. After many drivers went down the escape road to avoid being involved in the crash, a separate accident took place between Marco Andretti and Mario Moraes. Moraes lost control of his KV Racing Technology car behind Ana Beatriz, hit Andretti and became airborne before coming to rest across the cockpit of Andretti's car. It took several minutes to extricate Andretti from his damaged machinery, but was uninjured and <b>very</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Moraes' driving. The crash resulted in a seven-lap caution period, and eliminated Sato, Moraes and Andretti from the race. Dixon and Castroneves both recovered to the pit lane to repair damage.|$|E

25|$|Fichte was <b>very</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the {{opposition}} {{set up in}} Schelling's Naturphilosophie to his own conception of Wissenschaftslehre.

25|$|In 1944, Louis Waldman {{published}} his first autobiography, Labor Lawyer, {{in which he}} laid out his defense of the positions he had taken in his political career.

He was particularly alarmed by the integration of trade unions into the state apparatus that began to occur during World War II.|$|E
25|$|Xenophon (431-351 BC) and Plato (429-347 BC) both {{praised the}} {{moderate}} use of wine as beneficial {{to health and}} happiness, but both were critical of drunkenness, which appears to have become a problem.

Hippocrates (cir. 460-370 BC) identified numerous medicinal properties of wine, which had long been used for its therapeutic value.
