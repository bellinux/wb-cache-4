40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{relation}} of aortic <b>valve</b> <b>weight</b> to transvalvular gradient and area, with special regard to valve anatomy, size of calcific deposits, gender, and body size. Two hundred forty-two surgically excised stenotic aortic valves of patients (139 men, mean age 72 ± 9 years) who had undergone preoperative cardiac catheterization and echocardiography were weighed and examined with respect to number of cusps (tricuspid vs bicuspid), size of calcium deposits (microaggregates vs nodular macroaggregates), and presence of cholesterol clefts. The relation among <b>valve</b> <b>weight,</b> gradient, and area was studied. Transvalvular gradient was independent of gender or valve anatomy and was linearly correlated with <b>valve</b> <b>weight</b> absolutely (r = 0. 33, p < 0. 01) or normalized by body surface area (r = 0. 40, p < 0. 01). No correlation was evident between <b>valve</b> area and <b>weight.</b> Calcium macroaggregates were mainly present in men (51 %) and in bicuspid valves (67 %) and were seen to be strong determinants of <b>valve</b> <b>weight</b> (2. 84 ± 1. 03 g with macroaggregates vs 1. 63 ± 0. 56 g with microaggregates, p < 0. 001) but not of transvalvular gradient.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{correlate}} the weights of operatively excised stenotic aortic valves to preoperative transvalvular peak systolic gradients and to calculated aortic valve areas. BackgroundNo previous publication has correlated the weights of stenotic aortic valves to the transvalvular gradients or to the calculated aortic valve areas. MethodsWe weighed operatively excised stenotic aortic valves in 324 adults who had undergone preoperative left-sided cardiac catheterization. ResultsAs the weights of the operatively excised stenotic aortic valves increased (from 6 g), the average transvalvular peak systolic pressure gradients progressively increased. For any <b>valve</b> <b>weight,</b> in general, the women had higher average transvalvular gradients (p ≤ 0. 005) and lower average valve areas (p ≤ 0. 008) than did the men. Correlation between aortic <b>valve</b> <b>weight</b> and transvalvular gradient improved further when gender was taken into account.

40|$|Background: Paradoxical low {{gradient}} (PLG) severe {{aortic stenosis}} (SAS) is a recently described subset of SAS, whose exact clinical significance {{is a matter}} of intense debate. Some authors indeed consider this new entity as a more advanced form of SAS, whereas others believe it represents a relatively benign form of AS. To get further insight into the pathophysiology of PLG SAS, we compared the <b>weight</b> of the <b>valves</b> explanted at the time of surgery (AVR) and the degree of valve calcification, two surrogates markers of the true stenosis severity, among consecutive patients with PLG SAS and high-gradient (HG) SAS. Methods: We prospectively recruited 38 consecutive patients (20 men; mean age: 73 yrs) with isolated non-rheumatic SAS (indexed aortic valve area (AVAi) 0. 90) and in-vivo (r 2 = 0. 71) Agatston scores. Interestingly, valves explanted from patients with PLG SAS were lighter (1. 58 ± 0. 65 vs 2. 65 ± 1. 24 g, p= 0. 001) and showed lower ex-vivo Agatston scores (363 ± 282 vs 1211 ± 840, p< 0. 001) than HG SAS valves. These differences remained significant after adjustment for gender (1. 58 ± 0. 65 vs 2. 36 ± 0. 88 g, p= 0. 011 for <b>valves</b> <b>weight</b> and 363 ± 282 vs 1023 ± 597, p= 0. 002 for ex-vivo Agatston score).

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the rehydration characteristics and hydrodynamic performance of prosthetic valves before and after lyophilization. Two size 23 bovine pericardium aortic valve prostheses from different manufacturers were evaluated in a Shelhigh (Union, NJ, USA) pulse duplicator (80 ppm, 5 L/min) before and after lyophilization. Flow and transvalvular pressure gradient were registered in vitro and in vivo, and images of opening and closing of the prosthesis were obtained in the pulse duplicator in a digital camera. Rehydration was evaluated by comparison of dry <b>valve</b> <b>weight</b> with <b>valve</b> <b>weight</b> after 15 min, and 1, 24, 48, and 72 h in saline solution, inside the pulse duplicator. In vivo performance was assessed by surgical implantation in Santa Ines young male sheep in the pulmonary position after 30 min rehydration with 0. 9 % saline. Transvalvular pressure gradient and flow measurements were obtained immediately after implantation and 3 months after surgery when valves were explanted. Captured images showed a change in the profile opening and closing of valve prosthesis after lyophilization. The gradient measured (in vitro) in two valves was 17. 08 +/- 0. 57 and 18. 76 +/- 0. 70 mm Hg before lyophilization, and 34. 24 +/- 0. 59 and 30. 40 +/- 0. 97 mm Hg after lyophilization. Rehydration of both lyophilized valves was approximately 82 %. Drying changed the profile of the opening and closing of valve prostheses, and increased on average by 83 % the gradient in vitro tests.

40|$|Aortic valve {{calcification}} (AVC) or thickening {{is found}} in around one fifth {{of the general population}} between 65 - 75 years of age and increasingly thereafter. The process of aortic valve thickening and calcification is not only an aging (wear and tear) process of the valve leaflets. It is now considered to be closely related to atherosclerosis. The presence and the degree of AVC have been shown to have prognostic value in patients with cardiovascular diseases and in the general population. Despite its importance, there is no widely agreed upon scoring system that objectively quantifies AVC. The aim of this project was to investigate different methods for evaluating AVC, using transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography (TTE and TOE), intra-operative assessment of the valve (IOS) and ex vivo evaluation based on computed tomography (CT) of the excised aortic valves and based on <b>valve</b> <b>weight.</b> A 5 -grade scoring system was used for the visual assessment of AVC on real-time and still TTE and TOE images of the aortic valve, as well as intra-operatively. Computer-based greyscale measurement (GSM) software was used to obtain a quantitative-ultrasoundbased AVC measure, which was compared with the visual AVC score from TTE and TOE, whereas IOS was used as the gold-standard method. We also aimed at identifying the most suitable ex vivo conditions and CT parameters for optimal AVC scanning by CT in a calcium hydroxyapatite (CaHA) phantom study. The TTE and TOE AVC scores and IOS were compared to the weight and the CT CaHA mineral mass (MM) index of the explanted aortic valves. The study cohorts were recruited among patients undergoing aortic valve replacement because of aortic valve disease and/or ascending aorta aneurysm. In Study I, which included 185 patients, we showed that the visual evaluation of AVC using real-time TTE images yielded better correlations with IOS than did quantitative still frame measures based on GSM (r = 0. 83 vs 0. 64, respectively). In Study II, AVC scores based on TTE and TOE realtime images from 169 patients showed strong correlations with IOS (r = 0. 83 and 0. 82, respectively). GSM-based measures correlated less well with IOS, even for TOE (r = 0. 52). In Study II, we also showed that TOE was more accurate than TTE in diagnosing the aortic valve phenotype. In the CTphantom-based, methodological Study III, we identified optimal CT scanning and reconstruction parameters, as well as the most suitable medium (normal saline) for ex vivo tissue CT-based calcium scoring. In Study IV, 155 operatively explanted aortic valves were weighed and scanned ex vivo by CT, and CaHA MM was measured. The CaHA MM exhibited a strong correlation with <b>valve</b> <b>weight</b> (r = 0. 91), whereas AVC scores based on TTE, TOE and IOS showed weaker correlations. Conversely, echocardiographic and intra-operative AVC evaluation showed a better correlation with haemodynamic parameters compared with ex vivo CT AVC scoring. In conclusion, real-time echocardiographic images are crucial for accurate AVC scoring, regardless of whether TTE or TOE is used. Echocardiographic AVC scoring was as accurate as intraoperative assessment, according to <b>valve</b> <b>weight</b> and ex vivo CT. For ex vivo calcium scoring by CT, in addition to scanning and reconstruction parameters, using saline as the surrounding medium seems to be important.

40|$|In this thesis, {{a compact}} and light primary {{switched}} conversion system for AC-fed railway propulsion is investigated. It {{is characterized by}} soft switching of all converter stages and a source commutated primary converter comprising series connected <b>valves.</b> Both <b>weight</b> and volume of the conversion system are reduced significantly compared to a conventional system with a low frequency transformer. The conversion system {{is made up of}} N isolated AC/DC conversion cells, each comprising a cycloconverter and a voltage source converter (VSC) coupled by a medium frequency transformer. The cells are series connected on the AC side and connected to a common DC-link. Thus, 2 N+ 1 voltage levels can be synthesized at the AC terminal and the voltage stress on the transformer and line filter is reduced compared to a one cell solution. Series connection of semiconductor valves allows independent choice of blocking voltage and number of converter cells. Choosing two converter cells is an attractive compromise. Five level output reduces the harmonic distortion and simplify transformer and line filter design while keeping the complexity of the conversion system low. The mutually commutated converter (MCC) allows a transformer frequency in the range of 4 to 8 kHz without derating the line side converter due to zero voltage switching of the VSC. Modern magnetic materials, like high silicon steel, amorphous and noncrystalline materials allow design of the transformer with high efficiency at elevated frequencies. In a 15 kV system, the peak voltage at the catenary is typically beyond 32 kV which is far beyond the voltage capability of currently available semiconductors. Therefore, several semiconductors are connected in series. Favourable commutation conditions and a new gate drive arrangement allow snubberless commutation of the primary converter stage. Thus, the primary converter can be highly integrated, reducing both weight and volume. The conversion system can be placed on the roof or in the underframe without compromising efficiency or vehicle performance. The feasibility of the conversion concept has been demonstrated by means of a down-scaled prototype. Snubberless commutation of series connected valves is demonstrated. QC 2010072...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{butterfly}} valve {{is a type}} of flow control device, which is widely used to regulate a fluid flowing through a section of pipe. Currently, analyses and optimization are of special important in the design and usage of {{butterfly valve}}s. For the analysis, finite element method (FEM) is often used to predict the safety of valve disc, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is commonly used to study the flow characteristics of valve. However, it is difficult to obtain accurate results for the optimization of butterfly valve due to the high non-linearities. For this reason, metamodels or surrogate model methods are extensively employed. This paper integrates metamodel with FEM and CFD analysis to optimize a traditional butterfly <b>valve,</b> where the <b>weight</b> of the <b>valve</b> disc is the design objective, and the strength safety of disc and the pressure loss coefficient of valve are constraints. Kriging model is employed as a surrogate model to formulate the objectives and constrains, and the orthogonal array is used as design of experiment to sample the computer analysis. The optimum results with the corresponding variable combinations for the valve disc are obtained easily by this method. Moreover, the structural and fluid analyses with the obtained optimum variable combinations are conducted again to verify the accuracy of the optimization method. The results demonstrate the capability and potential of this method, which integrates the Kriging model with FEM and CFD analysis, in solving the optimization of a butterfly valve...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} define patient characteristics, outcomes, and {{associated}} factors after mitral valve replacement in children. MethodsWe included 104 children undergoing {{at least one}} mitral valve replacement between 1980 and 2003 and reviewed clinical records. Competing-risks methodology {{was used to determine}} time-related prevalence and associated risk factors after initial mitral valve replacement for death and repeat replacement. ResultsThe underlying mitral valve disease was congenital in 83 %, rheumatic in 13 %, Marfan syndrome in 3 %, and isolated endocarditis in 1 %, with 64 % having primarily regurgitation, 16 % having stenosis, 20 % having both, and 32 % having undergone previous valvotomy, valvuloplasty, or repair. There were 137 valve replacements, with 26 patients having more than one. Valve prosthesis type was St Jude Medical in 37 %, Björk-Shiley in 25 %, Carbomedics in 20 %, Ionescu-Shiley in 10 %, and other types in 8 %. Both early and late complications were common. Median age at the initial replacement was 5. 9 years (range, birth to 19 years). Competing-risks analysis predicted 19 % to have died at 15 years after initial replacement, with risk factors including noncongenital <b>valve</b> morphology, lower <b>weight,</b> and longer duration of cardiopulmonary bypass. A repeat replacement was predicted for 71 %, with risk factors including the presence of multiple left-heart obstructive lesions and Ionescu-Shiley valve prosthesis. ConclusionsMitral valve replacement might be necessary in children with extremely dysplastic valves and severe hemodynamic impairment or after failed repair. However, with the appropriate selection of the prosthetic valve and reduction of cardiopulmonary bypass time, surgeons might decrease mortality and increase prosthesis longevity...|$|R
40|$|Metal Matrix Composite (MMC) {{materials}} {{have been developed}} and used in many applications to reduce the weight of components where weight and deflection are the driving design requirement. MMC materials are being developed for use in some propulsion system components, such as turbo-pumps and thrust chambers. However, to date, no propulsion system valves have been developed that {{take advantage of the}} materials unique properties. The stiffness of MMC's could help keep valves light or improve life where deflection is the design constraint (such as seal and bearing locations). The low CTE of the materials might allow the designer to reduce tolerances and clearances producing better performance and lighter <b>weight</b> <b>valves.</b> Using unique manufacturing processes allow parts to be plated/coated for longer life and allow joining either by welding or threading/bolting. Additionally, casting of multi part pre-forms to form a single part can lead to designs that would be hard or impossible to manufacture with other methods. Therefore, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has developed and tested a prototype propulsion system valve that utilizes these materials to demonstrate these advantages. Through design and testing, this effort will determine the best use of these materials in valves designed to achieve the goal of a highly reliable and lightweight propulsion system. This paper is a continuation of the paper, The Application of Metal Matrix Composite Materials In Propulsion System Valves, presented at the JANNAF Conference held in April, 2002. Fabrication techniques employed, valve development, and valve test results will be discussed in this paper...|$|R
