5|$|First {{published}} in 2004 by Victor Gollancz Ltd, {{the book is}} Morgan's third novel, the first two {{being part of the}} Takeshi Kovacs series. Market Forces satirises corporate practices and globalisation and carries the theme of competition throughout the story. <b>Violence</b> <b>is</b> used {{as a metaphor for the}} mechanisms underlying capitalism and assumptions about haves and have-nots are challenged. It won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2005 and was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award. Though book reviewers gave it a mixed reception, Morgan's descriptive writing and action sequences received praise.|$|E
5|$|However, the Jain {{conception}} of ahimsa {{is quite different}} from what is commonly understood by violence. The <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> defined more by the motives and the consequences to the self rather than by the act itself. Furthermore, according to Jain Scriptures, destruction of less developed organism brings about lesser karmas than destruction of developed animals and karmas generated in observance of religious duties faultlessly disappears almost immediately. Hence, it is possible to observe complete nonviolence with right knowledge, even when some outward violence occurs to living beings in the course of performing religious duties by observing carefulness and pure mental disposition without any attachment.|$|E

In ancient warfare, sexual <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> a common procedure, perceived as an inevitable consequence of war. Soldiers needed to 'release' after heavy fighting; sexual distraction would reward, motivate and relax them. In other words, sexual <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> seen as 'collateral damage' and was therefore never prosecuted as a crime. This practice started to change after the Second World War. In fact, {{at the moment the}} existence of sexual <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> internationally acknowledged, women's rights gained recognition and several forms of sexual <b>violence</b> <b>were</b> classified. Finally, sexual <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> labeled as a 'weapon of war'...|$|R

5|$|Super Columbine Massacre RPG! is a {{role-playing}} video game. Players {{control the}} actions of teenagers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; the pair entered Colorado's Columbine High School on April 20, 1999 and killed 13 people before turning their guns on themselves in a library. Much of the game {{takes place in a}} third-person view, with players controlling Harris and Klebold from an overhead perspective. The graphics and characters are deliberately reminiscent of a 16-bit-era video game; while the content is violent, the <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> not graphically rendered.|$|E

Hagrid asks the three of them to look after Grawp if he himself must leave the school. Sure enough, Umbridge leads a party of Aurors to attack Hagrid in his house one night. Hagrid overpowers them and flees the school; McGonagall, trying to disrupt the <b>violence,</b> <b>is</b> badly injured and is put in St. Mungo's Hospital.|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{domestic}} <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> reflected in victims' physical, psychological, and sexual health {{as well as}} in victims' subjective evaluations of health or subjective well-being. The principal aim {{of this study was to}} study the extent to which the consequences {{of domestic}} <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> reflected in patients' subjectively evaluated well-being, life management, and sense of security in an emergency department, a maternity department, and a reception unit of a psychiatric hospital. A questionnaire on the effects of domestic <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> administered to 530 patients. 61 patients reported either current or previous domestic violence that affected their current well-being and life management. Domestic <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> reported to have an effect on subjective well-being and sense of security: the more recent or frequent the experience of <b>violence</b> <b>was,</b> the greater was considered its impact on well-being and sense of security. Routine inquiry can uncover hidden cases of abuse and hence would be of great benefit in the healthcare context. Early identification of abuse victims can prevent further harm caused by violence...|$|R
5|$|As Emmanuil Gushansky states, today {{subjective}} {{position of}} a Russian patient toward a medical psychologist and psychiatrist is defensive in nature and prevents the attempt to understand the patient and help him assess his condition. Such a position is related to constant, subconscious fear of psychiatrists and psychiatry. This fear is caused by not only abuse of psychiatry, but also constant violence in the totalitarian and post-totalitarian society. The psychiatric violence and psychiatric arrogance as one of manifestations of such <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> related to the primary emphasis on symptomatology and biological causes of a disease, while ignoring psychological, existential, and psychodynamic factors. Gushainsky notices that the modern Russian psychiatry {{and the structure of}} providing mental health care are aimed not at protecting the patient's right to an own place in life, but at discrediting such a right, revealing symptoms and isolating the patient.|$|E
5|$|Polygamy is common, with 39% {{of women}} living in such unions. This is sanctioned by law, which {{automatically}} permits polygamy unless spouses specify that this is unacceptable upon marriage. Although violence against women is prohibited, domestic <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> common. Female genital mutilation is also prohibited, but the practice is widespread and deeply rooted in tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among Arabs, Hadjarai, and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the Sara (38%) and the Toubou (2%). Women lack equal opportunities in education and training, {{making it difficult for}} them to compete for the relatively few formal-sector jobs. Although property and inheritance laws based on the French code do not discriminate against women, local leaders adjudicate most inheritance cases in favour of men, according to traditional practice.|$|E

I have never denied that <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing to}} employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens with}} the news of a fight {{circulating}} at a diner. This scene repeats itself at a pool hall, where gang members arrive via foot, forklift, and out of sewers, while the video's titular song begins to play. The camera cuts to a scene of Jackson lying on a bed, revealing he's the one singing contemplating the senseless violence. The singer notices rival gangs and leaves. Michael Jackson dons a red leather J. Parks brand jacket, and dances his way towards the fight through the diner and pool hall. A knife fight is taking place between the two gang leaders in a warehouse. They dance battle for an interlude of music until MJ arrives; the singer breaks up the fight and launches into a dance routine. The video ends with the gang members joining him in the dance, agreeing that <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> not the solution to their problems.|$|E

50|$|A 2008 review {{published}} in the journal Violence and Victims found that although less serious situation <b>violence</b> or altercation <b>was</b> equal for both genders, more serious and violent abuse was perpetrated by men. It was also found that women's physical <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> more likely motivated by self-defense or fear while men's was motivated by control. A 2011 systematic review from the journal of Trauma Violence Abuse also found that the common motives for female on male domestic <b>violence</b> <b>were</b> anger, a need for attention, or as a response to their partner's own violence. Another 2011 review {{published in}} the journal of Aggression and Violent Behavior also found that although minor domestic <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> equal, more severe <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> perpetrated by men. It was also found that men were more likely to beat up, choke or strangle their partners, while women were more likely to throw something at their partner, slap, kick, bite, punch, or hit with an object.|$|R

Intimate partner violence has been observed in opposite and same-sex relationships, and in the former instance by both men against women and women against men.
