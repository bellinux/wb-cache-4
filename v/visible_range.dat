Radio astronomy {{is different from}} most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons. Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.|$|E

30|$|For a given pixel in the {{temporal}} shadow map, we can skip storing {{the number of}} <b>visible</b> time <b>ranges</b> using the coverage map. To do this, we check a value of the coverage map at the current pixel before storing <b>visible</b> time <b>ranges.</b> If this value is positive, we exit and do not store any <b>visible</b> time <b>ranges.</b> Otherwise, we insert each <b>visible</b> time <b>range</b> to the current pixel of temporal shadow map. And the following pseudo code shows how to perform the shadow tests using the coverage map and {{the temporal}} shadow map.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{algorithm}} that renders motion blurred shadows efficiently on GPUs using a temporal shadow map. Each triangle moves during a frame {{and for each}} pixel, it is visible to the light {{in a range of}} time. The main idea of our algorithm is to find such <b>visible</b> <b>ranges</b> and store in the temporal shadow map. For each sample which is visible to the camera at a certain time, we can determine whether it is shadowed or lit using <b>visible</b> <b>ranges</b> in the temporal shadow map. Thus, our algorithm solves a time-mismatch problem in the time-dependent shadow mapping algorithm. Furthermore, we use a coverage map to reduce memory footprint used for the temporal shadow map.|$|R
2500|$|At the {{electronic}} level, {{it depends on}} whether the electron orbitals are spaced (or [...] "quantized") such that they can absorb a quantum of light (or photon) of a specific wavelength or frequency in the ultraviolet (UV) or <b>visible</b> <b>ranges.</b> This is what gives rise to color.|$|R

Birds, turtles, lizards, many fish and some rodents have UV receptors in their retinas. These animals can see the UV patterns found on flowers and other wildlife that are otherwise invisible to the human eye.|$|E
25|$|Metals {{can also}} be an {{effective}} way to confine light in structures equal to or smaller than the optical wavelength. This effect is emergent from the confined surface plasmon resonance induced by the resonating light, which, when confined to the surface of a nanostructure such as a gold channel or nanorod, induces electromagnetic resonance. Surface plasmon effects are strong in the <b>visible</b> <b>range</b> because the permittivity of a metal is very large and negative at visible frequencies. At frequencies higher than the <b>visible</b> <b>range,</b> the permittivity of a metal is closer to zero, and the metal stops being useful for focussing electric and magnetic fields. This effect was originally observed in radio and microwave engineering, where metal antennas and waveguides may be hundreds of times smaller than the free-space wavelength. In the same way, visible light can be constricted to the nano level with metal structures which form channels, tips, gaps, etc. Gold is also a convenient choice for nanofabrication because of its unreactivity and ease of use with chemical vapour deposition.|$|E

25|$|Bulk CdTe is {{transparent}} in the infrared, {{from close}} to its band gap energy (1.5 eV at 300 K, which corresponds to infrared wavelength of about 830nm) out to wavelengths greater than 20µm; correspondingly, CdTe is fluorescent at 790nm. As the size of CdTe crystals are reduced to a few nanometers or less, thus making them CdTe quantum dots, the fluorescence peak shifts through the <b>visible</b> <b>range</b> into the ultraviolet. CdTe quantum dots can self-assemble {{into a variety of}} nano- and microstructures, including helices. The tendency to self-assemble is rooted in the strong dipole-dipole interaction between the quantum dots in solution.|$|E
25|$|Further {{reduction}} is possible by using multiple coating layers, designed such that reflections from the surfaces undergo maximal destructive interference. One {{way to do}} this is to add a second quarter-wave thick higher-index layer between the low-index layer and the substrate. The reflection from all three interfaces produces destructive interference and anti-reflection. Other techniques use varying thicknesses of the coatings. By using two or more layers, each of a material chosen to give the best possible match of the desired refractive index and dispersion, broadband anti-reflection coatings covering the <b>visible</b> <b>range</b> (400–700nm) with maximal reflectivities of less than 0.5% are commonly achievable.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{choice of}} plasmatic metal nano-particles {{is crucial for}} the maximum light {{absorption}} in the active layer. Front surface located nano-particles Ag and Au are {{the most widely used}} materials due to their surface plasmon resonances located in the <b>visible</b> <b>range</b> and therefore interact more strongly with the peak solar intensity. However, such noble metal nano-particles always introduce reduced light coupling into Si at the short wavelengths below the surface plasmon resonance due to the detrimental Fano effect, i.e. the destructive interference between the scattered and unscattered light. Moreover, the noble metal nano-particles are impractical to implement for large-scale solar cell manufacture due to their high cost and scarcity in the earth's crust. Recently, Zhang et al. have demonstrated the low cost and earth abundant materials Al nano-particles to be able to outperform the widely used Ag and Au nano-particles. Al nano-particles, with their surface plasmon resonances located in the UV region below the desired solar spectrum edge at 300nm, can avoid the reduction and introduce extra enhancement in the shorter wavelength range.|$|E
30|$|The current {{implementation}} can be optimized {{using an}} approach described by Vasilakis and Fudos [19] to allocate memory dynamically every frame if {{the total number}} of <b>visible</b> time <b>ranges</b> changes. This approach allows to store all <b>visible</b> time <b>ranges</b> linearly in a one-dimensional array instead of a per-pixel linked list. In the future, we would like to find a method for generating the coverage map in a single rendering pass.|$|R

25|$|Feathers {{insulate}} birds {{from water}} and cold temperatures. They {{may also be}} plucked to line the nest and provide insulation to the eggs and young. The individual feathers in the wings and tail play important roles in controlling flight. Some species have a crest of feathers on their heads. Although feathers are light, a bird's plumage weighs {{two or three times}} more than its skeleton, since many bones are hollow and contain air sacs. Color patterns serve as camouflage against predators for birds in their habitats, and serve as camouflage for predators looking for a meal. As with fish, the top and bottom colors may be different, in order to provide camouflage during flight. Striking differences in feather patterns and colors are part of the sexual dimorphism of many bird species and are particularly important in selection of mating pairs. In some cases there are differences in the UV reflectivity of feathers across sexes even though no differences in color are noted in the <b>visible</b> <b>range.</b> The wing feathers of male club-winged manakins Machaeropterus deliciosus have special structures that are used to produce sounds by stridulation.|$|E
