This thesis mainly discusses different bioremediation techniques and identifies possible areas in Hong Kong for bioremediation and suggests bioremediation methods for each potential area. Bioremediation of toxic metals {{is the use of}} microorganisms, plants, or even larger sized organisms to decontaminate sites with toxic metals. Bioremediation includes phytoremediation, microremediation and <b>vermiremediation</b> which use plants, microorganisms and earthworms to remediate contaminated environments respectively. The 4 most common mechanisms in phytoremediation of toxic metals are phytoextraction, phytofiltration, phytovolatilization and phytostabilization. Phytoremediation are used frequently for remediation around the world and its development includes using well-understood technology and genetic engineering to increase its effectiveness. Microremediation is another promising technology in bioremediation of toxic metals and consists of 6 major mechanisms which are biosorption, bioaccumulation, biotransformation, bioleaching, biomineralization and microbially-enhanced chemisorption of metals. Microremediation is mainly in research phase and its development includes identifying new species, combining with phytoremediation and genetic engineering. <b>Vermiremediation</b> is another rapidly developing technique in bioremediation of toxic metals, assisting other bioremediation by burrowing actions of earthworms and its excretion, and accumulating toxic metals inside their bodies. <b>Vermiremediation</b> is also in research phase but it is rapidly developing. Generally, bioremediation is around 60 % cheaper than traditional remediation methods and no pollutants are emitted during the process. However the remediation process is slow and generally takes longer than a year. Sources of toxic metals in contaminated areas in Hong Kong are mainly due to historic industrial discharge although present activities also contribute. Potential areas include sites for electronic waste activities, sediments of Kwun Tong typhoon shelter and sediments of Tolo Harbour. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|E
40|$|In {{present study}} the {{efficiency}} for <b>vermiremediation</b> of municipal sewage sludge (MSS) with different bulking {{materials such as}} Cow Dung (CD), Sheep Manure (SM) and Garden Soil (GS) in presence of Eudrilus eugeniae and Eisenia foetida was investigated. The results revealed that interaction of worm species and bulking materials had significant effect on moisture %, EC and Cl- but it was non significant for pH and Organic Carbon (OC). At final stage of <b>vermiremediation</b> OC, EC and Cl- were reduced as compare to initial stage. The highest values for EC (8804 µmohs/cm) and OC (25. 63 %), were noted in the treatment SS + CD and no worm species. While maximum Cl- (1423 ppm) was found in treatment SS + no bulking material and no worm species. The results also indicated that the lowest EC (3424 µmohs/cm) was in treatment SS + GS + Eudrilus eugeniae, OC (13. 83 %) was in treatment SS + no bulking material + Eudrilus Eugeniae and Cl- (643. 0 ppm) was noted in treatment SS + CD + Eudrilus eugeniae. It is concluded that the effective bioremediation of sewage sludge is possible with cow dung manure or garden soil along with Eudrilus eugeniae or Eisenia foetida...|$|E
40|$|Earthworms {{are being}} used to manage most organic wastes; treat wastewater; {{clean-up}} chemically contaminated soils; improve soil fertility and produce food crops. Their use in production of life-saving medicines and raw materials for industries are some new discoveries. We have successfully experimented in vermicomposting of 'MSW', vermifiltration of 'municipal & industrial wastewater', <b>vermiremediation</b> of chemically contaminated soils' and production of 'cereal & vegetables crops' with amazing results. Wastes are degraded by over 75 % faster, BOD and TDSS of wastewater is reduced by over 95 % and growths of crop plants are enhanced by 30 - 40 % higher over chemical fertilisers.

40|$|Contaminated (TPHs {{and heavy}} metals) dredged sediments from Livorno port (Italy) were {{biological}} treated using plants and earthworms. Sediments presented an asphyctic physical structure {{owing to the}} silt?clay granulometric composition, a high salty level and a low organic content. A meso-scale experiment was done utilising three different bioremediation treatments: a) plants (Paspalum vaginatum and Tamarix gallica), b) earthworms (Eisenia foetida) and c) plant?earthworms combination. After one year, a suitable habitat for plants and earthworms was created due to the biochemical activation of the matrix, observing also a reduction of the organic and inorganic contaminants. bioremediation, Eisenia foetida, phytoextraction, marine sediments, <b>vermiremediation,</b> phytoremediation, TPHs, heavy metals, earthworms, plants, Paspalum vaginatum, Tamarix gallica, sediment reclamation, sediment contamination, environmental pollution, total petroleum hydrocarbons,...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons-contaminated {{soil and}} sewage sludge mixtures in microcosms were tested separately in triplicate with {{two types of}} biological agents, namely earthworms (Lumbricus rubellus) and spent fungal mycelia of Pleurotus sajor-caju (SPC) for 60 days. The results indicated that <b>vermiremediation</b> (VMR) and mycoremediation (MYC) showed degradation result of 99. 99 % PAHs i. e. Anth, Phen and BaP removal. Ten earthworms and 750 g of SPC depicted optimum results in nutrient element content among respective treatments. Treatment of MYC resulted a consistence increment of soil macronutrients except for TP and TKN (500 g treatment) compared to VMR. Hence, sixty days incubation of spent fungal mycelia of Pleurotus sajor-caju compost (SPC) is potential to degrade 99. 99 % of Anth, Phen and BaP {{but at the same}} time enrich the soil macronutrients i. e...|$|E
40|$|For {{more than}} a decade, {{the primary focus of}} {{environmental}} experts has been to adopt risk-based management approaches to cleanup PAH polluted sites that pose potentially destructive ecological consequences. This focus had {{led to the development of}} several physical, chemical, thermal and biological technologies that are widely implementable. Established remedial options available for treating PAH contaminated soils are incineration, thermal conduction, solvent extraction/soil washing, chemical oxidation, bioaugmentation, biostimulation, phytoremediation, composting/biopiles and bioreactors. Integrating physico-chemical and biological technologies is also widely practiced for better cleanup of PAH contaminated soils. Electrokinetic remediation, <b>vermiremediation</b> and biocatalyst assisted remediation are still at the development stage. Though several treatment methods to remediate PAH polluted soils currently exist, a comprehensive overview of all the available remediation technologies to date is necessary so that the right technology for field-level success is chosen. The objective of this review is to provide a critical overview in this respect, focusing only on the treatment options available for field soils and ignoring the spiked ones. The authors also propose the development of novel multifunctional green and sustainable systems like mixed cell culture system, biosurfactant flushing, transgenic approaches and nanoremediation in order to overcome the existing soil- contaminant- and microbial-associated technological limitations in tackling high molecular weight PAHs. The ultimate objective is to ensure the successful remediation of long-term PAH contaminated soils...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the effects of oil spills on the environment, using the 2010 Gulf of Mexico event, which motivated the selection of this research topic, as a case study. It examines the spill from both a social and biological assessment in which policy, technology, and economics direct oil spill response and remediation. The dissertation is partly based on material collected during two years of fieldwork in Southern Louisiana. The Deepwater Horizon case study includes qualitative research grounded in a participatory action research (PAR) approach. The PAR strategy includes collective inquiry and experimentation through direct experience. Although historically the effort to mitigate the effects of the Deepwater Horizon spill was the greatest cleanup response to an oil spill, the effort only affected 24 % of the oil released in the Gulf. The fate of the remaining oil is unknown. Natural gas {{was not included in the}} spill discharge metric, nor will recovered oil (skimming and siphoning) be deducted from the fine that will be assessed on the responsible party, British Petroleum. Response strategies, such as the use of chemical dispersants and in-situ burning, did not remove oil, but instead contributed to the cumulative pollution in the environment. This case study revealed an opportunity to create legislation that motivates increased investment in technologies and response strategies that support the removal of the oil from the environment. Trough the Deepwater Horizon case study, I also explored alternative spill response technologies and approaches to remediation and restoration. More than a dozen alternative technologies were evaluated and adopted during the 87 -day oil spill event. The technologies evaluated included advancements for oil removal [...] skimming and shoreline cleanup. Furthermore, for the first time, an oiled marsh was set aside for the purpose of conducting applied oil remediation and restoration research. Through a multi-institutional collaboration, we designed and implemented a restoration project on set-aside marsh in Louisiana. This project abandoned the use of cultivars and instead embraced genetically diverse, locally adapted plants for shoreline restoration. Included in the marsh project was a plant propagation innovation which utilized composted bagasse, a waste product of the Louisiana sugar cane industry, as a growth medium. The bagasse adds valuable organic material to the oil-impacted marsh and proved to be a viable propagation medium for smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) plants. Additional soil remediation research, funded by the Chevron Corporation, investigated the use of <b>vermiremediation</b> for crude oil-impacted soils. Analysis of vermitea, the liquid extract from vermicompost, indicated the presence of biosurfactant producing hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, allowing for the increased solubility of hydrophobic compounds adsorbed to soil. Additional research and field-scale experiments are required to optimize <b>vermiremediation</b> and demonstrate the potential for scaling and adoption. My research supports the use of natural attenuation of oil-contaminated soil though the adoption of strategies which help to maintain the existing ecosystem. My research findings elucidate the critical limitations of current conventional oil spill response technologies and reveal the environmental tradeoffs that occur during response decision-making. The dissertation demonstrates the need for additional investment in technology innovation and for broader response strategies and preparation for future oil spills...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Crude oil soil {{contamination}} is widespread, {{and due to}} the complex chemical nature of crude oil, remediation can be expensive and challenging. Crude oil that remains in soil {{for long periods of}} time can become sequestered in the soil matrix and become difficult to biodegrade. Heavier, more complex hydrocarbons are persistent in the environment due to resistance to biodegradation, which makes remediation problematic. Earthworms ingest soil, exposing it to intense physical and chemical processes and can increase soil microbial activity and therefore are promising candidates for enhancement of crude oil bioremediation. I examined if different earthworm species could tolerate and degrade crude oil. Toxicity tests established that Eisenia fetida and Apporectodea caliginosa were crude oil tolerant and suitable for use in crude oil degradation experiments. Two primary degradation experiments were performed. In the first, laboratory made soil was mixed with crude oil at concentrations of approximately 30, 000 mg/kg, with and without the addition of a microbial inoculum consisting of contaminated, native soil from an active remediation site. Petroleum degradation was examined in the presence and absence of E fetida. This experiment measured the importance of a hydrocarbon adapted microbial community to crude oil degradation rates. In the second, petroleum degradation in the contaminated, native soil from the remediation site was examined in the presence and absence of the E. fetida and A. caliginosa. The second experiment measured the effectiveness of earthworms on real-world soils that had weathered in the field for several decades. In the first degradation experiment, petroleum concentrations declined significantly (p< 0. 01) in the presence of E. fetida compared to controls. After 342 days, concentrations declined by 56 % without the microbial inoculum and 63 % with the microbial inoculum. Heavier and more complex hydrocarbons were more resistant to degradation. In the second experiment, petroleum concentrations declined by approximately 93 % in the native soil in the presence of each of the worm species, significantly more than the declines observed in the controls. The results of these experiments show that earthworms accelerate degradation of crude oil and are a promising candidate for the enhancement of crude oil bioremediation (<b>vermiremediation)</b> ...|$|E
