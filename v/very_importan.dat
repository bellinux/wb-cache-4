The paper describes a novel approach to reduce the response time of rule-based expert systems. Our optimization method {{is based on a}} construction of the reduced cycle-free finite state transition system corresponding to the input rule-based system. The method makes use of rule-base system decomposition, concurrency and state-equivalency. The new and optimized system is synthesized from the derived transition system. Compared with the original system, the synthesized system has (1) fewer number of rule firings to reach the fixed point, (2) is inherently stable and (3) has no redundant rules. The synthesis method also determines the tight response time bound of the new system. The optimized system is guaranteed to compute correct results independent of the scheduling strategy and execution environment. 1 Introduction Validation and verification is becoming a <b>very</b> <b>importan</b> [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Atrial {{tachycardia}} {{is defined}} as a regular atrial activation from atrial areas with centrifugal spread, caused by enhanced automaticity, triggered activity or microreentry. New ECG classification differentiates between focal andmacroreentrant atrial tachycardia. Macroreentrant atrial tachycardias include typical atrial flutter and other well characterized macroreentrant circuits in right and left atrium. Typical atrial flutter has been described as counterclockwise reentry within right atrial and it presents a characteristic ECG “sawtooth” pattern on the inferior leads. The foci responsible for focal atrial tachycardia do not occur randomly throughout the atria but tend to cluster at characteristic anatomical locations. The surface ECG is a very helpful tool in directing mapping to particular areas of interest. Atrial tachycardia should be differentiated from other supraventricular tachycardias. We propose a diagnostic algorithm in order to help the physician to discriminate among those. Holter analysis could offer further details to differentiate between atrial tachycardia and another supraventricular tachycardia. However, if the diagnosis is uncertain, it is possible to utilize vagal maneuvers or adenosine administration.

This technique offers invaluable information about living tissues with special contribution to the diagnosis and prognosis of the central nervous system diseases. Concentration of several metabolites can be assessed in a reproducible manner by means of modern clinical scanners. N-acetyl-aspartate is regarded as a neuronal marker and its levels reflect the neuronal density with significant decreases in degenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s disease. Choline-compounds reflect the cell’s membrane turnover and degradation. Myo-inositol has emerged as a glial marker with increases in degenerative diseases. The major usefulness of MRS has been reported in brain tumors, degenerative disorders, myelination defects and encephalopathies.

40|$|Higher-mode {{contribution}} {{is important in}} surface-wave inversion because it allows more information to be exploited, increases investigation depth, and improves model resolution. A new misfit function for multimodal inversion of surface waves, based on the Haskell-Thomson matrix method, allows higher modes {{to be taken into}} account without the need to associate experimental data points to a specific mode, thus avoiding mode-misidentification errors in the retrieved velocity profiles. Computing cost is reduced by avoiding the need for calculating synthetic apparent or modal dispersion curves. Based on several synthetic and real examples with inversion results from the classical and the proposed methods, we find that correct velocity models can be retrieved through the multimodal inversion when higher modes are superimposed in the apparent dispersion-curve or when it is not trivial to determine a priori to which mode each data point of the experimental dispersion curve belongs. The main drawback of the method is related to the presence of several local minima in the misfit function.

40|$|To {{explore the}} {{relevance}} of the rheological properties of maternal blood in pregnancy to fetal growth a study of whole blood viscosity (WBV) was conducted in the early third trimester of 138 pregnancies. A significant negative correlation was found between WBV at low shear rate and birthweight centile. As the rheological parameters were found to be negatively correlated with the placenta coefficient, an independent role for maternal WBV seems likely. When WBV, placental weight and degree of infarction accounted for significant contributions in a logistic regression model, diastolic blood pressure data did not assist in the correct prediction of occurrence of a low birthweight centile (less than 10 th). A simplified model is proposed, to explain the mechanisms by which some clinical variables may express their influence on fetal growth. In conclusion, it is suggested that WBV might be considered one of the factors which determine the efficacy of placental perfusion on the maternal side. However, as this variation in efficacy of placental perfusion is only weakly reflected in variations in birthweight, the influence of WBV on fetal growth cannot be <b>very</b> <b>importan...</b>|$|E

The risk analysis presented in this paper consists of forecasting and minimizing undesired events that could occur when a fuel cell is powering an electric vehicle.

40|$|The {{temporal}} ccp model tcc [3] {{is aimed}} at specifying timed systems. Time is conceptually divided into discrete intervals. In a particular time interval, a ccp process receives a stimulus (i. e. a constraint) from the environment, it executes with this stimulus as the initial store, and when it reaches its resting point, it responds to the environment with the resulting store. Also the resting point determines a residual process, which is then executed in the next time interval. This temporal ccp model is inherently deterministic and synchronous. The ntcc calculus [2] is a nondeterministic version of tcc which also allows asynchronous behavior. The motivation for this extension was partly {{the desire to be}} able to specify natural temporal behaviors like “the system must output c within the next t time intervals”, which is not possible in tcc. Also, the extension is argued to be consistent with the declarative flavor of ccp, i. e. to free the programmer from over-specifying a deterministic solution, when a non-deterministic simple solution is more appropriate (following the arguments behind Dijkstra’s language of guarded commands).
