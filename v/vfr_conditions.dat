50|$|The An-148 {{aircraft}} is a high-wing monoplane {{with two}} turbofan jet engines mounted in pods under the wing. This arrangement protects the engines and wing structure against damage from foreign objects (FOD). A built-in auto-diagnosis system, auxiliary power unit, high reliability, and the wing configuration allow the An-148 {{to be used}} at poorly equipped airfields. Modern flight and navigation equipment, featuring five 15 by 20 cm liquid crystal display (LCD) panels built by Russia’s Aviapribor and a fly-by-wire system enable the An-148 aircraft to operate day and night, under instrument flight rules (IFR) and visual flight rules (<b>VFR)</b> weather <b>conditions</b> on high density air routes. Similar to the Boeing 737, the main landing gear rotates into {{the belly of the}} aircraft when in flight, with partial doors covering the legs, and the sides of the tires remaining exposed. Other design advantages include the high fuel-efficiency of the Motor Sich D-436-148 engines and entrance stairs that enable boarding and deboarding the aircraft without extra ground equipment.|$|R

40|$|Orientation {{inside an}} {{aircraft}} in <b>VFR</b> (visual) <b>conditions</b> {{can be difficult}} if the flight area is unknown. Thus, this project proposes to design and analyze a very Low-Cost Inertial Navigation System (INS) in order to study whether the system {{would be able to}} locate the user visually inside a flight area. You should use the radionavigation aids or GPS system but it is interesting to use an INS as it does not depend of external agents. It can be interesting as in mountain areas the signal can be lost. Both radionavigation aids and GPS use a very high frequency (VHF band) in their signals. At VHF the signal cannot bounce on the ionosphere so the range would be limited. Also, it can avoid obstacles like a mountain. So, in mountain areas coverage can be a problem. Furthermore, you can use a custom map in order to highlight some visual interesting points as mountains or highway for instance. Also, it can be highlight aerial spaces and its frequencies. Using this system, you can monitor the entire flight. It can be interesting for a further analysis. It will be interesting for aviation college as it permits analyze how the flight was done. This system implementation is not only for aircraft, but it can be used for aerial, terrestrial and maritime vehicles...|$|R

50|$|MTRs are routes used by {{military}} aircraft to maintain proficiency in tactical flying. These routes are usually established below 10,000 feet MSL for operations at speeds {{in excess of}} 250 knots. Some route segments may be defined at higher altitudes for purposes of route continuity. Routes are identified as IFR (IR), and VFR (VR), followed by a number. 14-7 MTRs with no segment above 1,500 feet AGL are identified by four number characters (e.g., IR1206, VR1207). MTRs that include one or more segments above 1,500 feet AGL are identified by three number characters (e.g., IR206, VR207). IFR low altitude en route charts depict all IR routes and all VR routes that accommodate operations above 1,500 feet AGL.

40|$|Flight {{studies have}} {{been made of the}} {{low-speed}} operational regime of jet transports in order to assess potential operating problems. The study was performed utilizing a large multiengine jet airplane having geometric characteristics fairly representative of the jet transports; however, to insure general applicability of the results, the aerodynamic characteristics of the test airplane were varied to simulate a variety of jet-transport airplanes. The specific areas investigated include those of the take-off and landing, and the relation of these maneuvers to the 1 g stall speed and stalling characteristics. The take-off studies included evaluation of the factors affecting the take-off speed and attitude, including the effects of premature rotation and of over-rotation on ground run required. The approach and landing studies pertained to such factors as: desirable lateral-directional damping characteristics; lateral-control requirements; space-positioning limitations during approach under <b>VFR</b> or IFR <b>conditions</b> and requirements for glide-path controls; and evaluation of factors affecting the pilot's choice of landing speeds.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{different}} innovative research and educational {{activities related to}} parabolic flights conducted in Barcelona, based at Sabadell Airport and operated by Aeroclub Barcelona-Sabadell, since 2006. A CAP 10 B single-engine aerobatic aircraft is used, operating in Visual Flight <b>conditions</b> (<b>VFR).</b> Results from test flights have shown that these aircraft provide an environment of hypogravity for small experiments with a gravity quality of at least 0. 01 g 0 {{for as long as}} 8. 5 seconds. An experimenter may operate her or his own experiment in parabolic flight from within the aircraft cockpit. A specific flight simulator based on SolidWorks was developed to optimize the maneuvres. This software was used to later train the pilots and get less residual accelerations during the hypogravity period. Results from recent test flights show that these advancements have significally improved the gravity quality of the platform. Sensitivity to wind gusts have been analyzed. According to our analysis, acceptable wind conditions are a maximum of 15 knots of horizontal gusts, whereas thermal and vertical gusts should be avoided. Research campaigns and student campaigns have since 2008 been conducted. A student campaign consists of between 2 and 6 local flights, where the student conducts her or his experiment on board during every flight. A local flight provides up to 12 parabolas for each subject. These educational campaigns are known as the ”Barcelona Zero-G Challenge”, an international contest aimed at motivating students to conduct research in this field. A total of 12 students have flown their experiments on board the aircraft in 3 different educational campaigns (2010, 2011 and 2014), having published their results in relevant symposiums and scientific journals. These campaigns have attracted media attention and have promoted public awareness on aeronautical and space studies. The projects have been carefully peer- reviewed and selected by members of ELGRA (European Low Gravity Research Association) and ESA Education. A new edition of this contest is underway, with the winners expected to fly their experiment in 2017. Furthermore, students from our own University, UPC, have the opportunity of designing and testing their experiments within the framework of this parabolic flights platform. Further information on the contest ”Barcelona Zero-G Challenge” can be found at: window 2 theuniverse. org. In conclusion, this platform has shown to be excellent for educational and outreach campaigns, and also as a testbed for a proof-of-concept, before accessing other microgravity platforms.

Flight 44 was a charter flight from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Santa Ana, California, with nine Australian {{tourists}} and a pilot on board.

All persons on board the aircraft were killed. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was a backed out elevator down-stop bolt that limited down elevator travel and made it impossible for the pilot to prevent a pitchup and stall after takeoff.
