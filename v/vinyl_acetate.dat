5|$|Acetic acid is a {{chemical}} reagent {{for the production}} of chemical compounds. The largest single use of acetic acid is in the production of <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> monomer, closely followed by acetic anhydride and ester production. The volume of acetic acid used in vinegar is comparatively small.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary use}} of acetic acid is the {{production}} of <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> monomer (VAM).

40|$|It is {{reported}} that the interface between plastic film back covers and ethylene <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetates</b> (EVA) or polyvinyl butyral (PVB) in photovoltaic modules can influence water permeation, and electrial properties of the composites such as leakage current and dielectric constant. The interface can either be one of two dissimilar materials in physical contact with no intermixing, or the interface can constitute a thin zone which is an interphase of the two materials having a gradient composition from one material to the other. The former condition {{is described as a}} discrete interface. A discrete interface model was developed to predict water permeation, dielectric strength, and leakage current for EVA, ethylene methyl acrylate (EMA), and PVB coupled to Tedlar and mylar films. Experimental data was compared with predicted data...|$|R
25|$|<b>Vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> {{polymers}} include polyvinyl acetate, {{polyvinyl alcohol}} and polyvinyl acetal; {{all come from}} reaction products of <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> Some forms of acetates {{are known to be}} acidic and will do damage to an object with direct contact. Additionally, polyvinyl acetate mixtures tend to degrade in storage and release acetic acid, which in some cases can corrode lead. This compound's coloring ranges from clear/white to a soft yellow. As it ages, it will change to a deeper yellow. It can have a similar appearance to rubber adhesives but the difference is that PVA turns white when comes into contact with water. Warm water and acetone are typically used as solvents.|$|E
25|$|RAFT {{polymerization}} {{is known}} for its compatibility {{with a wide range of}} monomers compared to other controlled radical polymerizations. These monomers include (meth)acrylates, (meth)acrylamides, acrylonitrile, styrene and derivatives, butadiene, <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and N-vinylpyrrolidone. The process is also suitable for use under a wide range of reaction parameters such as temperature or the level of impurities, as compared to NMP or ATRP.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to copolymerization with alpha-olefins, ethylene {{can also be}} copolymerized {{with a wide range}} of other monomers and ionic composition that creates ionized free radicals. Common examples include <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (the resulting product is ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, or EVA, widely used in athletic-shoe sole foams) and a variety of acrylates. Applications of acrylic copolymer include packaging and sporting goods, and superplasticizer, used for cement production.|$|E

25|$|The main RAFT {{equilibrium}} {{and hence}} the rate retardation of the reaction is influenced by both temperature and chemical factors. A high temperature favors formation of the fragmentation products rather than the adduct radical Pn-S-C•(Z)-S-Pm. RAFT agents with a radical stabilising Z-group such as Phenyl group favor the adduct radical, as do propagating radicals whose monomers lack radical stabilising features, for example <b>Vinyl</b> <b>acetate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{copolymers}} have monomer residues arranged {{according to}} a statistical rule. A statistical copolymer in which the probability of finding {{a particular type of}} monomer residue at a particular point in the chain is independent of the types of surrounding monomer residue may be referred to as a truly random copolymer (structure 3). For example, the chain-growth copolymer of vinyl chloride and <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> is random.|$|E
25|$|The {{ball was}} {{constructed}} {{using a new}} design, consisting of eight thermally bonded, three-dimensional panels. These were spherically moulded from ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). The surface of the ball was textured with grooves, a technology developed by Adidas called GripnGroove that was intended to improve the ball's aerodynamics. The design received considerable academic input, being developed in partnership with researchers from Loughborough University, United Kingdom. The balls were made in China, using latex bladders made in India, thermoplastic polyurethane-elastomer from Taiwan, ethylene <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> isotropic polyester/cotton fabric, and glue and ink from China.|$|E
50|$|A {{cardboard}} {{record was}} {{a type of}} cheaply made phonograph record made of plastic-coated thin paperboard. These discs were usually small, had poor audio quality compared to <b>vinyl</b> or <b>acetate</b> discs, and were often only marginally playable due to their light weight, slick surface, and tendency to warp like a taco shell. Playability could be improved by placing a coin between the lock groove and the spindle hole to add weight and stability. These records are distinct from both flexi discs, which are sturdier, and {{from many of the}} old home-recording discs since cardboard discs were mass-produced for a specific purpose.|$|R
40|$|Lipases from Geotrichum candidum 4013 (extracellular lipase and cell-bound lipase) were immobilized by {{adsorption}} on chitosan beads.

50|$|Unlike {{ordinary}} vinyl records, {{which are}} quickly formed from lumps of plastic by a mass-production molding process, a so-called acetate disc {{is created by}} using a recording lathe to cut an audio-signal-modulated groove into {{the surface of a}} special lacquer-coated blank disc, a real-time operation requiring expensive, delicate equipment and expert skill for good results. They are made for special purposes, almost never for sale to the general public. They can be played on any normal record player but will suffer from wear more quickly than <b>vinyl.</b> Some <b>acetates</b> are highly prized for their rarity, especially when they contain unpublished material.|$|R
25|$|The density {{decreases}} up to a comonomer {{share of}} 10% {{because of the}} disturbed crystal formation. With higher proportions it approaches to the one of polyvinyl acetate (1.17 g/cm3). Due to decreasing crystallinity ethylene <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> copolymers are getting softer with increasing comonomer content. The polar side groups change the chemical properties significantly (compared to polyethylene): weather resistance, adhesiveness and weldability rise with comonomer content, while the chemical resistance decreases. Also mechanical properties are changed: stress cracking resistance and toughness in the cold rise, whereas yield stress and heat resistance decrease. With a very high proportion of comonomers (about 50%) rubbery thermoplastics are produced (thermoplastic elastomers).|$|E
25|$|MOFs {{might prove}} useful for both {{photochemical}} and polymerization reactions {{due to the}} tuneability of {{the size and shape}} of their pores. A 3D MOF { • 4DMF • H2O} (bpdc: biphenyldicarboxylate, bpy: 4,4′-bipyridine) was synthesized by Li and coworkers. Using this MOF photochemistry of o-methyl dibenzyl ketone (o-MeDBK) was extensively studied. This molecule was found to have a variety of photochemical reaction properties including the production of cyclopentanol. MOFs have been used to study polymerization in the confined space of MOF channels. Polymerization reactions in confined space might have different properties than polymerization in open space. Styrene, divinylbenzene, substituted acetylenes, methyl methacrylate, and <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> have all been studied by Kitagawa and coworkers as possible activated monomers for radical polymerization. Due to the different linker size the MOF channel size could be tunable on the order of roughly 25 and 100 Å2. The channels were shown to stabilize propagating radicals and suppress termination reactions when used as radical polymerization sites.|$|E

40|$|Curated by Caroline Stevenson for Cartel Gallery, London, this {{installation}} {{consisted of}} a 9 m drawing (divided into four) juxtaposed with a sound element – an arrangement of three record players (each playing their own one-off <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetates),</b> two speakers and an amplifier. James Thomas made a topographical study of a S. L. O. A. P (Space Left Over After Planning) under the Bow flyover in East London and illustrated the events he experienced as drawn marks on graph paper. This then became the source material for a soundscape produced by Solina Hi-Fi. Solina Hi-Fi approached the drawing as a score. Once an overall approach to the interpretational and durational aspects of the score was decided each member was assigned one graphic element of the score to work with; dot, line and cloud. Each member worked alone on their part, the whole piece coming together {{only at the end}} when dot, line and cloud were cut onto one-off acetates (dub-plates) and placed onto three record players. The audience was invited to make their own composition of Hum by playing, rewinding, stopping, starting, speeding up, slowing down and generally manipulating the record players in any way they saw fit. The work was also presented as an edition of 100 triple vinyl albums with sleeve notes. The album has three records, one each for dot, line and cloud.

40|$|The {{miscibility}} behaviour of blends of poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) with poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), poly(vinyl <b>acetate)</b> (PVAc) and <b>vinyl</b> chloride-vinyl <b>acetate</b> (VCVAc) copolymer {{has been}} investigated {{on the basis of}} a viscometric approach. PVP is found to be miscible with PVC over the entire composition range, as is evident from the high values observed for the intrinsic viscosity of transfer. This is further supported by the single glass transition temperature observed in differential scanning calorimetry studies of the blend films. Blends of PVP with VCVAc copolymer exhibit microphase separation which is shown clearly in the scanning electron micrographs of the films. PVAc/PVP blends show interaction only at low PVAc contents, but in general are immiscible...|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{modified}} cements and mortars {{have become}} popular {{for use as}} patch repair materials. General evidence suggests that these materials offer considerable improvements compared to traditional mortars although the mechanisms for this are not fully understood. This work elucidates the factors which govern some properties and performance of different polymer systems. In view of {{the wide range of}} commercial systems available, investigations concentrated on the use of three of the most commonly available groups of polymers. These were: (1) Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR), (2) Acrylics and, (3) Ethylene <b>Vinyl</b> <b>Acetates</b> (EVA). The later two were in the form of both emulsions and redispersible powders. Experiments concentrated on: (1) Rheological behaviour of polymer modified cement pastes; (2) Workability of polymer modified mortars; (3) Influence of curing conditions on the pore size distribution and diffusion of chloride ions; (4) Bond strength of polymer modified cement and mortar patches; and (5) Microscopic examination and semi-quantitative analyses of the bulk and interfacial microstructures. The following main conclusions were reached: (1) The addition of polymer emulsions have a considerable influence on the workability of fresh cement pastes, the extent of this {{depending on the type of}} system used. (2) The rheological parameters of fresh polymer modified mortars can be established using a two-point workability test which may be used when comparing the properties of different systems at constant workability. (3) Curing conditions affect the properties of polymer modified systems and a wet/dry curing regime was essential for good adhesion of these materials to mortar substrates. (4) In contrast, the wet/dry curing regime resulted in a curing affected zone at the surface of patch materials. This can result in a much coarser pore structure and enhanced diffusion of e. g. chloride ions. (5) The microstructure of polymer modified systems was very different compared with the unmodified cement/mortar and varied depending on curing conditions...|$|R
2500|$|Concern {{has arisen}} about the {{possible}} carcinogenicity of the <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (acetic acid ethenyl ester) used by some manufacturers in their gum bases.

2500|$|Acrylic fibers are {{synthetic}} fibers {{made from}} a polymer Polyacrylonitrile with an average molecular weight of ~100,000, about 1900 monomer units. To be called acrylic in the United States, the polymer must contain at least 85% acrylonitrile monomer. Typical comonomers are <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> or methyl acrylate.

2500|$|Traditionally, {{acetaldehyde}} {{was mainly}} {{used as a}} precursor to acetic acid.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of thermal}} degradation of three <b>vinyl</b> chloride-co-vinyl <b>acetate</b> (PVC-co-PVAc) copolymers with PVAc content of 14, 14 and 10 wt. % was investigated at various temperatures (220 – 250 °C) in solution. Reaction samples {{were analyzed by}} gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to obtain the molecular weight distribution (MWD). The degradation rate coefficients were determined from the time evolution of the MWDs. The energies of activation, determined from the temperature dependence of the rate coefficients, of the three copolymers were 92, 77 and 100 kJ/mol, respectively. The degradation of these copolymers was also investigated thermogravimetrically {{in the presence of}} nitrogen. The activation energies, determined from the Friedman technique, were 114, 92 and 131 kJ/mol, respectively. This indicated that the overall stability order of the copolymers remained same in both the methods. This also indicated that copolymers having the same PVAc content exhibit different stability. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that reports the activation energies, rate coefficients for the degradation of these copolymers as well as show that copolymers having the same composition degrade differently...|$|R

J Dent Res 57 (4) : 563 - 569, April 1978. There are no completely satisfactory maxillo-facial reconstructive materials. The best maxil-lofacial prosthesis available today, although excellent when originally delivered, deterior-ates in 6 to 12 months {{to the point where}} it re-quires replacement.
