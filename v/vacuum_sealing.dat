500|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{neptunium}} sulfide compounds have been characterized, including the pure sulfide compounds NpS, NpS3, Np2S5, Np3S5, Np2S3, and Np3S4. Of these, Np2S3, prepared by reacting NpO2 with hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide at around 1000°C, is the most well-studied and three allotropic forms are known. The α form exists up to around 1230°C, the β up to 1530°C, and the γ form, which can also exist as Np3S4, at higher temperatures. NpS can be created by reacting Np2S3 and neptunium metal at 1600°C and Np3S5 can be prepared by the decomposition of Np2S3 at 500°C or by reacting sulfur and neptunium hydride at 650°C. Np2S5 is made by heating a mixture of Np3S5 and pure sulfur to 500°C. All of the neptunium sulfides except for the β and γ forms of Np2S3 are isostructural with the equivalent uranium sulfide and several, including NpS, α−Np2S3, and β−Np2S3 are also isostructural with the equivalent plutonium sulfide. The oxysulfides NpOS, Np4O4S, and Np2O2S have also been created, although the latter three have not been well studied. NpOS was first prepared in 1985 by <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealing</b> NpO2, Np3S5, and pure sulfur in a quartz tube and heating it to 900°C for one week.Np mossbauer investigations on neptunium oxide chalcogenides NpOS and NpOSe |journal=Materials Research Bulletin |volume=20 | pages=723–30 |doi=10.1016/0025-5408(85)90151-5}} ...|$|E

50|$|Many users report {{degradation}} of alpha-GPC when stored openly or {{for long periods}} of time. Alpha-GPC is hygroscopic and will pull moisture in from the surrounding air. This will cause the powder to turn into {{what appears to be a}} gel. Alpha-GPC with >99% purity will undergo this process at a visible rate (seconds to minutes) and thus requires minimized exposure to the air. This hygroscopic quality can cause gel capsules not fully packed with alpha-GPC to dissolve. Proper storage methods need to be used with alpha-GPC and include removing all air from the container, double bagging with plastic bags rated for chemicals (less likely to leak air), and storing bulk/excess inside the freezer. Vacuum sealed bags are highly recommended. For people accessing alpha-GPC daily it is advisable to separate a month's supply from excess and storing the excess as best as possible. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>sealing</b> a large supply into many 1 month dividends is a method positively reported by many users. It is important to note that hygroscopy is not degradation and leaves the substance still usable, however, the ability to accurately weigh a dose is no longer possible as the substance being weighed will be a mixture of powder and water. Liquefied or gelled alpha-GPC may also be indicative of poor storage and thus have an increased likelihood of actual degradation.|$|E

40|$|We report {{detailed}} {{characterization of}} a <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealed</b> angle measuring silicon MEMS gyroscope.

The <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealed</b> SOI prototype with a 2 kHz operational frequency demonstrated virtually identical X- and Y-mode Q-factors of 1. 1 million. Due to the stiffness and damping symmetry, and very low dissipation, the gyroscope can be instrumented for direct angle measurements with fundamentally unlimited rotation range and bandwidth. Experimental characterization of the mode-matched gyroscope operated in whole-angle mode confirmed linear response in excess of ± 450 °/s range and 100 Hz bandwidth (limited by the setup), eliminating both bandwidth and range constraints of conventional MEMS rate gyroscopes...|$|R
