5|$|Asch was shy when {{he moved}} to the United States and did not speak English fluently. He went to the {{neighborhood}} public school, P.S. 147, to attend 6th grade.

5|$|Simon Spies, {{owner of}} Spies Rejser, speculated in February 1971 {{that he might}} merge his airline Conair of Scandinavia with Trans Polar, {{although}} he also stated that once his airline received new aircraft {{it would no longer}} necessarily need to charter aircraft from other airlines. Trans Polar was subject to a lawsuit by a laid-off pilot which the airline owed NOK26,600 in pay and compensation for him paying his own connection flights to reach Trans Polar charters. The company had issued several cheques and bills of exchange that had bounced and the pilot threatened to bankrupt the airline unless he was paid. The company responded that he would have a <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> bankrupting them and the press should instead write about the airline's future, which they regarded as very bright.|$|E

25|$|Ahad Ha'am's {{ideas were}} popular at a <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> for Zionism, {{beginning}} after {{the failures of}} the first Aliya. His unique contribution was to emphasise the importance of reviving Hebrew and Jewish culture both in Palestine and throughout the Diaspora, something that was recognised only belatedly, when it became part of the Zionist program after 1898. Herzl did not have much use for Hebrew, and many wanted German to be the language of the Jewish state. Ahad Ha'am {{played an important role in}} the revival of the Hebrew language and Jewish culture, and in cementing a link between the proposed Jewish state and Hebrew culture.|$|E

25|$|Phillip had a <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> {{assembling}} the fleet {{which was to}} make the eight-month sea voyage to Australia. Everything a new colony might need had to be taken, since Phillip had no real idea of what he might find when he got there. There were few funds available for equipping the expedition. His suggestion that people with experience in farming, building and crafts be included was rejected. Most of the 772 convicts (of whom 732 survived the voyage) were petty thieves from the London slums. Phillip was accompanied by a contingent of marines {{and a handful of other}} officers who were to administer the colony.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{there was}} no {{information}} on the effectiveness for respirators of specific design (type) in the workplace. This {{is due to the}} fact that the measurement of workplace PF is <b>very</b> <b>difficult,</b> <b>time</b> consuming, and expensive work, which was carried out not very often. For these types of respirators experts used the results of WPF measurements of other types of respirators, which are similar. For example, the effectiveness of the Supplied Air Respirators (SARs, with hose) was considered similar to the efficiency of Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs), if they have the same facepieces and the same air supply mode. Finally, in the absence of this information, specialists could use the results of Simulated WPF measurements; or estimates of competent experts.|$|E
25|$|Without any obvious cause Genie's {{incontinence}} immediately resurfaced, and {{was especially}} severe {{for the first}} few weeks after she moved in but persisted at a lower level for several months. In contrast to Butler's writings, the Riglers observed Genie still acted out her anger on herself and noted that certain situations in particular, such as spilling containers of liquid, sent her into tantrum behavior, which doctors attributed to her having been beaten for these actions as a child. The research team recorded her speech being much more halting and hesitant than Butler described, writing that Genie very rarely spoke and that, for {{the first three months of}} her stay, almost always used one-word utterances. Unless she saw something which frightened her both her speech and behavior exhibited a great deal of latency, often several minutes delayed, for no clear reason, and she still had no reaction to temperature. She continued to have a <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> controlling her impulses, frequently engaging in highly anti-social and destructive behavior.|$|E

50|$|While Hakim had a {{great deal}} of respect for the {{intelligence}} and enthusiasm of Sadr, he viewed his political activism as contrary to its principles and interests. Hakim therefore asked Sadr to dissociate his relationship with Da'wa and generally discouraged his efforts to reform large parts of the hawza curriculum, though some important reforms were undertaken. Hakim therefore maintained the quietist balance through <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>times,</b> and ultimately projected a stance on politics and religion in the Shi'i community that remains influential today.|$|R
