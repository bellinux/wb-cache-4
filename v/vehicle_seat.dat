This study reports the frequency-weighted r. m. s. accelerations in, and axes and the total vibration (point vibration total value) at five locations on seatback surface at around <b>vehicle</b> <b>seat</b> twisting resonant frequencies.

40|$|Accurate upfront {{prediction}} of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>seat</b> dynamic characteristics {{is important for}} cost reduction. However, the characterization of the occupied <b>vehicle</b> <b>seat</b> poses a challenging task for seat designers. This {{is due to the}} complex and non-linear dynamic behavior of the human body when submitted to vibration excitation. Here, the research investigates the changes in the major resonant frequencies and their corresponding mode shapes of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>seat</b> when occupied by volunteers of different weights. This is done to characterize the effect of the seated human weight on the <b>vehicle</b> <b>seat</b> structure. The results indicate that the unoccupied <b>vehicle</b> <b>seat</b> possesses three major resonant frequencies and mode shapes (Lateral, Fore-Aft and Twisting). The effect of adding the human body to the seat showed that only shifts in the resonant frequencies was observed and does not add any new vibration modes. Similarly, changes in occupant weight cause the respective resonant frequencies to shift. Increase in occupant weight causes a decrease in the lateral resonant frequency while fore-aft frequency increases. However, the twisting resonant frequency was not affected significantly by the occupant weight. Results from this study are expected to reduce the need for complex modeling of the human body in upfront analysis in design of vehicle seats...|$|E

40|$|In 1997, ISO 2631 - 1 (Evaluation {{of human}} {{exposure}} to whole body vibration- General requirement) was published. At ISO 2631 - 1, the common indicator {{for evaluating the}} health, discomfort, perception, and motion sickness about whole body vibration is defined, and it is decided by evaluation of the discomfort when the human is taking-a-seat posture that vibrating 12 -axis included {{in the human body}} of the supporting seat surface, the seat-back and the feet is measured simultaneously. 6 -axis (3 -axis vibration: x, y and z, and 3 -axis rotational vibration: roll, pitch, yaw) in the supporting seat surface did not correspond to 3 -axis seat pickup defined by ISO 5008, and did not have the way measured actually. Moreover, there were also no measuring instruments, which can carry out simultaneous measurement of the 12 -axis based on ISO- 2631 - 1 standard. Therefore, there are very few studies investigating 12 axes vibration data on the different kinds of <b>vehicle</b> <b>seats</b> according to the ISO 2631 - 1 standard for evaluating perception or discomfort of multi-axis vibration. The growing importance of detrimental vibrations on mobile machinery, magnified by increasing working speed, emphasizes the need to evolve from static to dynamic design of mechanical systems.

There were no special equipments as a commercial base to measure 12 axes vibration on the <b>vehicle</b> <b>seats</b> in the world.

However, the direct measurement of pelvis location in a <b>vehicle</b> <b>seat</b> is difficult due to interference from the vehicle and its seat structure, as well as driver factors such as abdomen adiposity. An optimization method was developed to locate the driver's pelvis based on the kinematic relationships between the pelvis bony landmarks, body landmarks, and skeletal joint locations measured in a laboratory “hardseat” that allows access to posterior landmarks. The method accounts for variation in flesh margins at pelvis landmarks. Body landmark locations were measured using a coordinate measurement machine for 90 {{men and women in the}} hardseat and a <b>vehicle</b> <b>seat</b> set to 9 driver package conditions.

40|$|Final, April 2011 ‐May 2012 In a {{previous}} study, a computational model of child occupants 6 to 10 years old (YO) was validated {{using data from}} a sled test series with the 6 YO and 10 YO Hybrid‐III ATDs. Simulations using this model were used to identify characteristics of a <b>vehicle</b> <b>seat</b> and belt geometry that would improve occupant protection for older children not using booster seats. The current report presents a series of sled tests {{to examine the effects}} for other occupants using vehicle seats optimized for 6 ‐ to 10 ‐year‐old children. Tests were conducted with a 12 MO CRABI seated in a Graco SnugRide rear‐facing infant restraint and a Hybrid III 50 th male ATD. Seat cushion length was set to 450 mm, 400 mm, and 350 mm. Lap belt conditions included one representing the mid‐range of FMVSS No. 210, “Seat belt assembly anchorages,” allowable seat belt anchorage conditions as well as one more forward but closer to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>seat</b> H‐point. Shoulder belt conditions included the standard FMVSS No. 213 shoulder belt anchorage as well as one positioned closer to the adult male shoulder. Vehicle seats from a 2008 Dodge Town and Country were used, and some tests included modifications to make the front support structure of the seat cushion stiffer. The tests with the midsize adult male ATD showed no negative consequences from design changes intended to improve protection for children. Kinematics were similar among all conditions tested. For the rear‐facing infant restraint, none of the tests exceeded the 70 ° rotation angle requirement of FMVSS No. 213, although shorter cushion length and more forward belt locations produced larger rotations. The three tests with the more forward lap belt geometry slightly exceeded the 3 ‐ms‐chest clip acceleration limit of 60 g, but a review of all chest acceleration curves suggests that the <b>vehicle</b> <b>seat</b> may produce higher chest accelerations than the FMVSS No. 213 test bench. In tests with the shortest seat cushion length, the infant seat showed acceptable kinematics even though less than 80 percent of the child restraint base was initially supported on the <b>vehicle</b> <b>seat.</b> These preliminary tests with rear <b>vehicle</b> <b>seat</b> configurations selected to optimize protection for older child occupants produced good restraint kinematics for infants in a rear‐facing only child restraint and for adult mid‐size males. Additional research to identify possible negative consequences for other types of child restraints should be conducted.
