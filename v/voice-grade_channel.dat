50|$|As pair gain {{electronics}} and point-to-point microwave radio links came into widespread use throughout the public switched telephone network, telephone companies filed tariffs to eliminate their past responsibility of providing leased circuits with direct current continuity. If {{the base station}} were located across town in an area served by a different telephone exchange, the only available circuits reaching the distant exchange might be a single <b>voice-grade</b> <b>channel</b> in a D-4 channel bank on a DS-1 or a single microwave radio baseband channel. Tone remotes became necessary with the wide use of telephone carrier or multiplexing equipment. They require only a voice-grade audio path with roughly flat equalization from 300-3,000 Hz. A circuit that could pass audio in both directions {{could be used for}} remote control.|$|E
50|$|The Teletype Model 35 is a 110 baud {{terminal}} that utilizes {{a serial}} input / output eight-level 11 unit code signal {{consisting of a}} start bit, seven information bits, an even parity bit and two stop bits. The Model 35 was produced in ASR, KSR and RO versions. The Model 35 handles 1963 and USASI X3.4-1968 ASCII Code and prints 63 graphics of this code with letters in upper case on an 8.5 wide inch page using a typebox. The Model 35 interface will accept DC current (20 ma or 60 ma). An optional modem interface provides for operation over <b>voice-grade</b> <b>channels.</b> The modem transmits asynchronously in serial format, compatible with Bell System 101, 103 and 113 data sets or their equivalent.|$|R
50|$|The Teletype Model 38 is a 110 baud {{terminal}} that utilizes {{a serial}} input / output 11 unit code signal {{consisting of a}} start bit, seven information bits, an even parity bit and two stop bits. The Model 38 was produced in ASR, KSR and RO versions. The Model 38 handles USASI X3.4-1968 ASCII Code and prints 94 graphics of this code with letters in both upper and lower case, with the option to print in two colors on a pin-fed, 14-7/8 inch wide page. The Model 38 interface will accept either DC current (20 ma or 60 ma) or EIA RS-232-C. A built-in modem interface provides for operation over <b>voice-grade</b> <b>channels.</b> The modem transmits asynchronously in serial format, compatible with Bell System 101, 103, 108 and 113 data sets or their equivalent.|$|R
50|$|TDMoIP {{is a type}} of pseudowire (PW). However, {{unlike other}} traffic types that can be carried over pseudowires (e.g. ATM, Frame Relay and Ethernet), TDM is a {{real-time}} bit stream, leading to TDMoIP having unique characteristics. In addition, conventional TDM networks have numerous special features, in particular those required in order to carry <b>voice-grade</b> telephony <b>channels.</b> These features imply signaling systems that support a wide range of telephony features, a rich standardization literature and well-developed Operations and Management (OAM) mechanisms. All of these factors {{must be taken into account}} when emulating TDM over PSNs.|$|R
