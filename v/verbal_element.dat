5000|$|A {{very large}} and {{productive}} class of verbs in Neo-Mandaic consists of a <b>verbal</b> <b>element</b> and a non-verbal element, which form a single semantic and syntactic unit. The non-verbal element is most often a noun such as əwɔdɔ ‘deed’ in the compound əwɔdɔ əwad ~ əwod (ɔwed) ‘to work or to do something,’ or an adjective such as həyɔnɔ ‘alive’ in the compound həyɔnɔ tammɔ ‘to survive,’ although prepositions such as qɔr ‘at,’ in the compound qɔr tammɔ ‘to be born to s.o.,’ are attested. In many of these compounds, the <b>verbal</b> <b>element</b> is a [...] "light" [...] verb, which serves only to indicate verbal inflections such as person, tense, mood, and aspect; the meaning of these compounds is primarily derived from the non-verbal element, which always precedes the <b>verbal</b> <b>element.</b> The most common light verbs are əwad ~ əwod (ɔwed) ‘to do,’ əhaw ~ əhow (ɔhew) ‘to give,’ məhɔ ~ məhi (mɔhi) ‘to hit,’ and tammɔ ‘to become.’ Although phrasal verbs similar to these are attested in Classical Mandaic, most Neo-Mandaic phrasal verbs are calqued upon Persian phrasal verbs, and many non-verbal elements are Persian or Arabic loan words.|$|E

40|$|This is a draft {{document}} {{subject to}} revision. This paper considers {{the treatment of}} the English inflectional verb features: 1) tense, 2) voice, and 3) aspect, within a computational model of human language comprehension grounded in linguistic and psycholinguistic theory. Verbs, including auxiliary and modal verbs, are inflectionally encoded with tense, aspect and voice features and these features can project to, or be expressed by, the clauses in which they occur. When there are multiple <b>verbal</b> <b>elements</b> in a clause, the grammatical features of the <b>verbal</b> <b>elements</b> must be reconciled. Monotonic unification of grammatical features is not possible when the grammatical features of the <b>verbal</b> <b>elements</b> conflict. Non-monotonic mechanisms of feature blocking and overriding are needed to handle the reconciling of incompatible features. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the representation and processing of the English verb features tense, aspect and voice, within a computational cognitive model of human language processing. We {{assume that a}} collection of features is associated with each <b>verbal</b> <b>element</b> and that these features may project to the clauses in which they occur. When multiple verbal elements occur, {{it is possible for}} the features to conflict, necessitating mechanisms of feature blocking and overriding to determine feature projection. The alternative of having multiple entries in the mental lexicon for each <b>verbal</b> <b>element</b> with different feature sets is avoided due to the ambiguity that would be introduced, and the weak grammatical motivation for doing so. However, we do assume an ambiguity in the case of most v-ed and v-base verb forms, with the past tense v-ed form being distinct from the past participle v-ed form and the present tense v-base form being distinct from the non-finite v-base form. We assume that every finite clause expresses a tense and voice feature and many finite clauses express an aspect feature as well. We {{consider the}} case of transitive and intransitive verbs in combination with the auxiliary verbs ―be ‖ and ―have ‖ in finite clauses. For intransitive verbs, we introduce an active/inactive voice feature distinction which aligns with the transitive distinction between active and passive voice...|$|E

The present study follows Sinclair in assuming that such verbless clauses are not a distinct clause type, but manifest ellipsis of the copula under certain conditions.

40|$|In English, verbs {{can take}} {{different}} forms, such as verb forms {{related to the}} use of tenses, the -ing form, and infinitives. This thesis deals with one of the verb forms, the infinitives, as they occur in three Newsweek articles. In this thesis, this problem is elaborated in terms of the research questions : the syntactic structures in which the infinitive verbs occur, the syntactic functions of the infinitives, and types of infinitives and syntactic functions which are predominant. The infinitives are analyzed in terms of their functions. Following Nelson Francis (1958 : 292), there are four types of syntactic structures: structure of modification, structure of predication, structure of complementation, and structure of coordination. There are two types of infinitives, infinitives with to and infinitives without to. The findings reveal that predominantly infinitives with to, which function as <b>verbal</b> <b>elements,</b> are found in the structure of complementation. In the structure of modification, infinitives without to mostly occur and function as heads. Semantically, infinitives have the same pattern as finite verbs in normal sentences in a sense that they function as <b>verbal</b> <b>elements</b> which go with their subjects...|$|R
