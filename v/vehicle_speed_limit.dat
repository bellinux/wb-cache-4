An RFID reader present in the vehicle senses the <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> on the tag as a reference speed input(attached to the speed limit signboard). Here,the active RFID tag is used in the signboard which is having a battery supplied from the solar panel. This reference speed is given to the electronic control unit. Meanwhile the vehicle speed sensor present in the wheel gives the actual speed of the vehicle on road. The output of this ECU unit is given to the proposed braking system present in the automobiles. We here suggest two braking systems in this paper. It’s having an advantage of not supplying the power to rural area signboards...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to assess head injury risks and kinematics of adult pedestrians and bicyclists in primary impact to the passenger cars and secondary impact to the ground using real world accident data and computer reconstructions of the accidents. For this purpose, a subsample of 402 pedestrians and 940 bicyclists from the GIDAS database, Germany, {{was used for the}} statistical analysis, from which 22 pedestrian and 18 bicyclist accidents were further selected for reconstruction. PC-Crash was used to calculate impact conditions, such as vehicle impact velocity, vehicle kinematic sequence, and thrown distance. These conditions were employed to identify the initial conditions in reconstruction in MADYMO program. A comparable analysis was conducted based on the results from accident analysis and computer reconstructions for the impact configurations and the resulting injury patterns of pedestrians and bicyclists in view of head injury risks. Differences in HIC, head-relative impact velocity, linear acceleration, maximum angular velocity and acceleration, contact force, thrown distance, Wrap Around Distance (WAD), and head contact time were evaluated. Injury risk curves were generated by using a logistic regression model for vehicle impact velocity. The results indicate that bicyclists suffered less severe injuries compared with severity of pedestrian injuries. In the selected samples, the AIS 2 + and AIS 3 + head injury risks for pedestrians are 50 % probability at impact speed of 38. 87 km/h and 54. 39 km/h respectively, while for bicyclists at 53. 66 km/h and 58. 89 km/h respectively. The findings of high injury risks suggested that in the area with high frequency car-pedestrian accidents, the <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> should be 40 km/h, while in the area with high frequency car-cyclist accidents the <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> should be 50 km/h.

40|$|Several methods {{exist for}} {{quantifying}} {{the quality of}} service provided by a roadway from a bicyclist’s perspective; however, many of these models do not consider physically protected bike lanes and, of those that do, none is based on empirical data from the US. This is problematic as engineers, planners, and elected officials are increasingly looking to objective performance measures to help guide transportation project design and funding prioritization decisions. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a cumulative logistic model to predict user comfort on protected bike lanes developed from data collected during in-person video surveys. The surveys were conducted in Portland, OR with video footage gathered in Chicago, IL, Portland, OR and San Francisco, CA. The model is for road segments only and not signalized intersections. It complements the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 level-of- service methods by providing an analysis procedure for a facility type that is not currently included in the manual. The model indicates {{that the type of}} buffer, direction of travel (one-way vs. two-way), adjacent motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit,</b> and average daily motor vehicle volumes are all significant predictors of bicyclist comfort in protected bike lanes. The model predicts a mean value of ‘A’ or ‘B’ on an A (most comfortable) – F (least comfortable) scale for all protected bike lane clips used in the survey. Consistent with previous research findings, survey respondents report that protected bike lanes are generally more comfortable than other types of on-street infrastructure...|$|E

40|$|Most highly {{motorized}} {{countries in}} the world have implemented different speed limits for light weight and heavy weight vehicles. The heavy <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> is usually chosen to be lower than that of passenger cars due to the difficulty for the drivers to safely maneuver the heavy vehicle at high speed and greater impact during a crash. However, in many cases, the speed limit for heavy vehicle is set by only considering the vehicle size or category, mostly due to simplicity in enforcement. In this study, traffic and vehicular data for all vehicle types were collected using a weigh-in-motion system installed at Federal Route 54 in Malaysia. The first finding from the data showed that the weight variation for each vehicle category is considerable. Therefore, the effect of gross vehicle weight (GVW) and category of heavy vehicle on free flow speed and their interaction were analyzed using statistical techniques. Empirical analysis results showed that statistically for each type of heavy vehicle, there was a significant relationship between free flow speed of a heavy vehicle and GVW. Specifically, the results suggest that the mean and variance of free flow speed decrease with an increase GVW by the amount unrelated to size and shape for all GVW range. Then, based on the 85 th percentile principle, the study proposed a new concept for setting the speed limit for heavy vehicle by incorporating GVW where a different speed limit is imposed to the heavy vehicle, not only based on vehicle classification, but also according to its GVW.

40|$|Abstract. Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) is {{a system}} that {{constantly}} monitors vehicle speed, local speed limit on a road and implements an action such as giving warning or discourages the drivers when the vehicle is detected to be exceeding the speed limit. A GPS connected to digital speed map allows Intelligent Speed Adaptation technology to continuously update the <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> to the road speed limit. The main purpose of this project is to study the speed profile and effect on driver’s psychology on Intelligent Speed Adaptation to bus drivers before and after the intervention of ISA technology. An experiment was conducted on GPS-ISA instrument involving about 20 respondents of Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Shah Alam Campus bus drivers from various backgrounds. The instrument used to collect data is GPS-ISA device. The data gained from GPS-ISA device is speed profile to specify the speeding and speed variation. To evaluate driver’s psychology, a set of questionnaire was designed. The data gained from questionnaire are attention level, stress level, and ISA acceptance level. The result of total differences for all 20 respondents between the average speed before and after the intervention for Zone 1 to Zone 5 was- 8. 95 km/h. For driver’s psychology results, most of the respondents are willing to use ISA system if given a chance. Majority of respondents did not felt any stress and distraction while driving by using ISA system. For conclusion, the ISA system proved to be efficiently reduced speed of busses in UiTM Shah Alam campus zone and can be used as an initiative in order to assist bus drivers to reduce speed of vehicles especially in campus zone...|$|E

40|$|In {{the absent}} of {{intensive}} {{tests in the}} wind tunnel, this study provided an effective and accurate approach to estimate the operational driving speed limit on bridges subjected to different road conditions and wind intensities, through a convenient continuous simulation technique (CSP). A fast and rigorous simulation tool, VPSIM is developed to effectively model the vibration of vehicles travelling on bridges by considering the interactions between wind, vehicles and the bridge. The CSP, on the other hand, dramatically reduces the data generation time and makes the stability analysis of vehicles possible. The application of the proposed method on the Confederation Bridge in Canada {{is presented as a}} numerical example. Furthermore, a parallel iteration technique (PIT) is proposed to address the non-linear effects on long-span bridges, such as the cable sags and the nonlinearity due to large displacements. The efficient PIT extended the application of the proposed simulation technique to the cable-stayed bridges and the suspension bridges. To more realistically simulate the wind induced effect on these very flexible bridges, the fluttering effect is incorporated into the proposed model. A numerical example is presented in this thesis to roundup the all the techniques proposed. The simulation result override the public impression that only high-sided vehicle is sensitive to wind attacks, this research demonstrated that a light-weight vehicles are likely to suffer from instability problems on bridges under relatively low wind velocity. Besides, different types of vehicle can undergo different instability mechanism under the same wind condition and the instability mechanism of a vehicle varies with wind speed. The numerical examples also demonstrated that the allowable <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> on cable-stayed bridges is significantly lower than that on roads...|$|E

The problem {{in the investigation of}} a vehicle movement in a curve is the ignorance of the contributions of vehicle dynamics intervention of the electronic stability system. Although some of the simulation software used in the analysis of road accidents makes it possible {{to take into account the}} modelled vehicle movement impacted by a stabilization system in the examined process, but the experts do not know what parameters should be entered in the numerical models of stabilization system in a computer programme. Therefore, the thesis investigates the issue of the expert analysis of vehicle riding and braking in a general spatial curve at speeds exceeding 50 kph with simultaneous examining the impact of electronic stability system chassis on vehicle driving dynamics. The thesis first deals with the solutions based on classical analytical methods, then dwells on experimental measurements in real conditions on testing grounds and, finally, addresses the use of computer simulation software in expert practice. Nevertheless, it is important to realize that no computer simulation software can be an absolutely unambiguous solver, and it is not enough to generate a computer simulation, but so obtained results should be evaluated and justified technically. Road accident analyst needs to know the impact of vehicle electronic stability control systems on vehicle movement. The thesis investigated the mutual relationship between the <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> in a curve specified by analytical calculation and the vehicle speed in a curve experimentally detected by measuring the parameters of driving dynamics of a vehicle equipped with electronic stability system.

Finally, the input values of significant quantities of computational models of the ESP simulation programs were found consistent with the results of experimental measurements in defined curves for the vehicles equipped with electronic stability systems.
