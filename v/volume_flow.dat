25|$|A flow bench {{consists}} of an air pump of some sort, a metering element, pressure and temperature measuring instruments such as manometers, and various controls. The test piece is attached in series with the pump and measuring element and air is pumped through the whole system. Therefore, all the air passing through the metering element also passes through the test piece. Because the <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> rate through the metering element is known and the flow through the test piece is the same, it is also known.

25|$|A {{refrigeration}} system's {{coefficient of}} performance (CoP) {{is very important in}} determining a system's overall efficiency. It is defined as refrigeration capacity in kW divided by the energy input in kW. While CoP is a very simple measure of performance, it is typically not used for industrial refrigeration in North America. Owners and manufacturers of these systems typically use performance factor (PF). A system's PF is defined as a system's energy input in horsepower divided by its refrigeration capacity in TR. Both CoP and PF can be applied to either the entire system or to system components. For example, an individual compressor can be rated by comparing the energy needed to run the compressor versus the expected refrigeration capacity based on inlet <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> rate. It {{is important to note that}} both CoP and PF for a refrigeration system are only defined at specific operating conditions, including temperatures and thermal loads.

40|$|Traditional <b>flow</b> <b>volumes</b> {{construct}} an explicit geometrical or parametrical representation from the vector field. The geometry is updated interactively and then rendered using an unstructured volume rendering technique. Unless a detailed refinement of the <b>flow</b> <b>volume</b> is specified for the interior, information inside the underlying <b>flow</b> <b>volume</b> {{is lost in}} the linear interpolation. These disadvantages can be avoided and/or alleviated using an implicit flow model. An implicit flow is a scalar field constructed such that any point {{in the field is}} associated with a termination surface using an advection operator on the flow. We present two techniques, a slice-based three-dimensional texture mapping and an interval volume segmentation coupled with a tetrahedron projection-based renderer, to render implicit stream flows. In the first method, the implicit flow representation is loaded as a 3 D texture and manipulated using a dynamic texture operation that allows the flow to be investigated interactively. In our second method, a geometric <b>flow</b> <b>volume</b> is extracted from the implicit flow using a high dimensional iso-contouring or interval volume routine. This provides a very detailed <b>flow</b> <b>volume</b> or set of <b>flow</b> <b>volumes</b> that can easily change topology, while retaining accurate characteristics within the <b>flow</b> <b>volume.</b> The advantages and disadvantages of these two techniques are compared with traditional explicit <b>flow</b> <b>volumes...</b>|$|R

[...] Lasseter also felt that traditional animation created more character believability. For example, with Louis the alligator, created by Eric Goldberg, Lasseter said: [...] "It's the believability of this large character being able to move around quite like that." [...] Choreographer Betsy Baytos was brought by the directors to lead a team of eccentric dancers that gave reference to make each character a different style of movement. The character design tried to create beautiful drawings through subtle shapes, particularly for most characters being human. For the frog versions of Tiana and Naveen, while the animators started with realistic designs, they eventually went for cutesy characters [...] "removing all that is unappealing in frogs", similar to Pinocchios Jiminy Cricket.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Some {{types of}} antenatal {{maternal}} psychological distress {{may be associated}} with reduced fetal growth and birthweight. A stress-mediated reduction in placental blood flow has been suggested as a mechanism. Previous studies have examined this using ultrasound-derived arterial resistance measures in the uterine (UtA) and umbilical (UA) arteries, with mixed conclusions. However, a reduction in placental <b>volume</b> blood <b>flow</b> may occur before changes in arterial resistance measures are seen. Fetoplacental <b>volume</b> blood <b>flow</b> can be quantified non-invasively in the umbilical vein (UV). Our objective was to study whether specific types of maternal psychological distress affect the placental circulation, using <b>volume</b> blood <b>flow</b> quantification in addition to arterial resistance measures. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of 104 non-smoking pregnant women (gestational age 30 weeks) with uncomplicated obstetric histories. Psychological distress was measured by General Health Questionnaire- 28 (subscales anxiety and depression) and Impact of Event Scale- 22 (subscales intrusion, avoidance and arousal). UtA and UA resistance measures and UV <b>volume</b> blood <b>flow</b> normalized for fetal abdominal circumference, were obtained by Doppler ultrasound. RESULTS: IES intrusion scores above the mean were associated with a reduction in normalized UV <b>volume</b> blood <b>flow</b> (corresponding to - 0. 61 SD; P =  0. 003). Adjusting for UA resistance increased the strength of this association (difference - 0. 66 SD; P< 0. 001). Other distress types were not associated with UV <b>volume</b> blood <b>flow.</b> Maternal distress was not associated with arterial resistance measures, despite adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Intrusive thoughts and emotional distress regarding the fetus were associated with reduced fetoplacental <b>volume</b> blood <b>flow</b> in third trimester. Uterine and umbilical artery resistance measures were not associated with maternal distress. Our findings support a decrease in fetoplacental blood flow as a possible pathway between maternal distress and reduced fetal growth...|$|R
