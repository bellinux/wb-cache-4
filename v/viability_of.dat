5|$|However, {{even though}} on a per-individual basis, many other species are {{actually}} more efficient at pollinating, on the 30% of crop types where honey bees are used, most native pollinators cannot be mass-utilized as easily or {{as effectively as}} honey bees—in many instances they will not visit the plants at all. Beehives can be moved from crop to crop as needed, and the bees will visit many plants in large numbers, compensating via saturation pollination for what they lack in efficiency. The commercial <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> these crops is therefore strongly tied to the beekeeping industry. In China, hand pollination of apple orchards is labor-intensive, time consuming, and costly.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the contribution of plaque and saliva towards the prolonged activity, also called substantivity, of three antimicrobial mouthrinses (Listerine (R), Meridol (R), Crest Pro Health (R)), used in combination with a toothpaste (Prodent Coolmint (R)). Volunteers brushed for 4 weeks with a toothpaste without antimicrobial claims, while during the last 2 weeks half of the volunteers used an antimicrobial mouthrinse in addition to brushing. At the end of the experimental period, plaque and saliva samples were collected 6 h after oral hygiene, and bacterial concentrations and viabilities were determined. The contribution of plaque and saliva towards substantivity was assessed by combining plaque obtained after mechanical cleaning only with plaque and saliva obtained after additional use of an antimicrobial rinse.

40|$|Adult flies were {{collected}} from Suwon population and the third chromosomes were extracted from each of 112 males using the Ser/Sb balancer stocks. Then the homozygote <b>viabilities</b> <b>of</b> the third chromosome were estimated under the normal (2512) and the heat-shock (371 (3) conditions. A degree of response(name as Responsability) {{was measured by the}} ratio <b>of</b> <b>viabilities</b> under the heat shock and the normal condition. Furthermore, the puffing patterns of the strains which have shown high and low responsability were analyzed with heat-induced puffs on the polytene chromosome in order to observe relationship between responsability and the expression of Hsp genes. The following results were obtained. 1) The lethal frequency on the third chromosome of homozygous strains was 0. 277 + 0. 042. 2) The average <b>viabilities</b> <b>of</b> non-lethal homozygous strains were estimated 0. 800 + 0. 026 and 0. 726 + 0. 026 at normal and heat shock condition, respectively. 3) The average responsability was estimated 0. 938 + 0. 032. The wide distribution of responsabilities represented that there were many of variants for heat-shock responses in the third chromosome of the natural population. 4) Comparing with the puffing patterns on the polytene chromosome, it was observed that the duration of the puffs of 87 A and 87 C, which were known to code Hsp 70, was longer in the strains of high responsability than in those of low one. ope...|$|R
40|$|Arrowhead (AR) third {{chromosome}} {{arrangements of}} Drosophila pseudoobscura, whose competitive fitnesses had been determined in population cages, were tested for their genetic loads in homozygous, heterozygous (homokaryotypic), and heterokaryotypic (AR/CH) combinations. The {{results showed that}} their competitive population cage performances were correlated to their viabilities as homozygotes but were not correlated to their viabilities as heterozygotes or as heterokaryotypes. However, the results do not fit in too simply with the mutational model of population structure, since the improvement <b>of</b> homozygous <b>viability</b> with increased competitive fitness was not accompanied by a significant degree of dominance {{as measured by the}} regression <b>of</b> <b>viabilities</b> <b>of</b> heterozygotes on homozygotes. Only the AR chromosomes derived from the population with poorest competitive fitness showed marked partial dominance (h=. 35). The <b>viabilities</b> <b>of</b> heterokaryotypes were markedly uniform for all chromosomes tested and produced significantly greater numbers of flies per culture than the homokaryotypes. In general, the results show that the ranking of relative competitive fitnesses of these chromosomes is not a simple extrapolation <b>of</b> their <b>viabilities,</b> although marked changes in the populations tested have occurred. It is proposed that the differences in competitive fitness, homozygous <b>viability,</b> and degree <b>of</b> dominance observed among these chromosomes, arise from differences in genetic variability which enable different linkage relationships to be established for genes affecting these attributes...|$|R
