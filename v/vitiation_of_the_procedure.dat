As hydrogen and oxygen, which are gaseous by nature, are robbed of their natural ‘freedom’, i.e., of their gaseous nature, by combining {{with each other in}} <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> water, so does the soul become crippled in respect of its natural functions in consequence of its union with matter.

40|$|Objective. To assess <b>the</b> {{correlation}} <b>of</b> abnormal trunk postures and reposition {{sense of}} subjects with forward head neck posture (FHP). Methods. In all, postures of 41 subjects were evaluated and the FHP and trunk posture including shoulder, scapular level, pelvic side, and anterior tilting degrees were analyzed. We used the head repositioning accuracy (HRA) test to evaluate neck position senses of neck flexion, neck extension, neck {{right and left}} side flexion, and neck right and left rotation and calculated the {{root mean square error}} in trials for each subject. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients and regression analysis were used to assess <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> correlation between <b>the</b> trunk posture and HRA value, and a significance level of α = 0. 05 was considered. Results. There were significant correlations between <b>the</b> HRA value <b>of</b> right side neck flexion and pelvic side tilt angle (p< 0. 05). If pelvic side tilting angle increases by 1 degree, right side neck flexion increased by 0. 76 degrees (p= 0. 026). However, there were no significant correlations between other neck motions and trunk postures. Conclusion. Verifying pelvic postures should be prioritized when movement is limited due to <b>the</b> <b>vitiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proprioceptive sense <b>of</b> neck caused by FHP...|$|R
60|$|To what {{a degree}} this loose mode of {{classing}} and denominating objects has rendered <b>the</b> vocabulary <b>of</b> mental and moral philosophy unfit for <b>the</b> purposes <b>of</b> accurate thinking, {{is best known}} to whoever has most meditated on <b>the</b> present condition <b>of</b> those branches of knowledge. Since, however, <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> a new technical language as <b>the</b> vehicle <b>of</b> speculations on subjects belonging to <b>the</b> domain <b>of</b> daily discussion, {{is extremely difficult to}} effect, and would not be free from inconvenience even if effected, the problem for the philosopher, and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most difficult which he has to resolve, is, in retaining the existing phraseology, how best to alleviate its imperfections. This can only be accomplished by giving to every general concrete name which there is frequent occasion to predicate, a definite and fixed connotation; in order that it may be known what attributes, when we call an object by that name, we really mean to predicate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object. And <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> most nicety is, how to give this fixed connotation to a name, with the least possible change in the objects which the name is habitually employed to denote; with the least possible disarrangement, either by adding or subtraction, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group <b>of</b> objects which, in however imperfect a manner, it serves to circumscribe and hold together; and with <b>the</b> least <b>vitiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> truth <b>of</b> any propositions which are commonly received as true.|$|R
40|$|Cerebral ischaemia, {{associated}} with neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, {{is known to}} perturb blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity and promote brain oedema formation. Using an in vitro model of human BBB composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes, this study examined whether suppression of TNF-α, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, might attenuate ischaemia-mediated cerebral barrier damage. Radical decreases in transendothelial electrical resistance and concomitant increases in paracellular flux across co-cultures exposed to increasing periods of oxygen-glucose deprivation alone (0. 5 – 20 h) or followed by 20 h of reperfusion (OGD ± R) confirmed <b>the</b> deleterious effects <b>of</b> ischaemic injury on cerebral barrier integrity and function which concurred with reductions in tight junction protein (claudin- 5 and occludin) expressions. OGD ± R elevated TNF-α secretion, NADPH oxidase activity, O 2 radical dot− production, actin stress fibre formation, MMP- 2 / 9 activities and apoptosis in both endothelial cells and astrocytes. Increases in MMP- 2 activity were confined to its extracellular isoform and treatments with OGD + R in astrocytes where MMP- 9 could not be detected at all. Co-exposure of individual cell lines or co-cultures to an anti-TNF-α antibody dramatically diminished <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> OGD ± R-evoked oxidative stress, morphological changes, apoptosis, MMP- 2 / 9 activities while improving the barrier function through upregulation of tight junction protein expressions. In conclusion, <b>vitiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exaggerated release <b>of</b> TNF-α {{may be an important}} therapeutic strategy in preserving cerebral integrity and function during and following a cerebral ischaemic attack...|$|R
