500|$|Many mammals {{communicate}} by vocalizing. Vocal communication serves many purposes, including in mating rituals, as warning calls, to indicate food sources, and for social purposes. Males often call during mating rituals {{to ward off}} other males and to attract females, as in the roaring of lions and red deer. The songs of the humpback whale may be signals to females; they have different dialects in {{different regions of the}} ocean. Social vocalizations include the territorial calls of gibbons, and the use of frequency in greater spear-nosed bats to distinguish between groups. The <b>vervet</b> <b>monkey</b> gives a distinct alarm call for each of at least four different predators, and the reactions of other monkeys vary according to the call. For example, if an alarm call signals a python, the monkeys climb into the trees, whereas the eagle alarm causes monkeys to seek a hiding place on the ground. Prairie dogs similarly have complex calls that signal the type, size, and speed of an approaching predator. Elephants communicate socially with a variety of sounds including snorting, screaming, trumpeting, roaring and rumbling. Some of the rumbling calls are infrasonic, below the hearing range of humans, and can be heard by other elephants up to [...] away at still times near sunrise and sunset.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vervet</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{have four}} {{confirmed}} predators: leopards, eagles, pythons, and baboons. The sighting of each predator elicits an acoustically distinct alarm call. In experimentation with unreliable signalers, individuals became habituated to incorrect calls from a specific individual. Though {{the response was}} lessened for a specific predator, if an unreliable individual gives an alarm call for a different predator, group members respond as if the alarm caller is, in fact, reliable. This suggests <b>vervet</b> <b>monkeys</b> are able to recognize and to respond to not only the individual calling, {{but also to the}} semantics of what the individual is communicating. It is believed that <b>vervet</b> <b>monkeys</b> have up to 30 different alarm calls. In the wild <b>vervet</b> <b>monkeys</b> have been seen giving a different call when seeing a human being approaching, leading to researchers believing that <b>vervet</b> <b>monkeys</b> may have a way of distinguishing between different land and flight predators.|$|R

50|$|Grooming in {{primates}} {{meets the}} conditions for reciprocal altruism according to some studies. One of the studies in <b>vervet</b> <b>monkeys</b> shows that among unrelated individuals, grooming induce higher chance of attending to each other's calls for aid. However, <b>vervet</b> <b>monkeys</b> also display grooming behaviors within group members, displaying alliances. This would demonstrate <b>vervet</b> <b>monkey's</b> grooming behavior {{as a part of}} kin selection since the activity is done between siblings in this study. Moreover, following the criteria by Stephen, if the study is to be an example of reciprocal altruism, it must prove the mechanism for detecting cheaters.|$|R
500|$|Lions are generalist hypercarnivores {{and usually}} hunt in groups. Their prey {{consists}} mainly of mammals, particularly ungulates, with {{a preference for}} wildebeest, zebras, buffalo, gemsbok, and giraffes in Africa and chital, sambar deer, nilgai, wild boar, chinkara and chousingha in India. African lions prefer prey weighing [...] They generally avoid fully grown adult elephants, hippopotamuses and rhinoceroses, as well as very small prey like dik-dik, hyrax, hare and <b>vervet</b> <b>monkey.</b> However, Thomson's gazelles may be hunted and warthogs are often taken depending on availability, despite being below the preferred weight range. In most areas, {{a small number of}} species may make up around three-fourths of the lion's diet. In Serengeti National Park, wildebeest, zebras and gazelle are the majority of prey. In Kruger National Park, giraffes are the most common prey, and in Manyara Park, Cape buffaloes constitute as much as 62% of the lion's diet, due to the high number density of buffaloes. At the Okavango Delta, with its strong seasonal changes in prey, up to eight species may make up three quarters of a lion's diet. Occasionally adult hippopotamus are taken at Gorongosa National Park and calves are commonly hunted at Virunga National Park. In addition to size, the aquatic nature of hippos makes them normally unavailable as prey. [...] The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting young elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. [...] Lions also attack domestic livestock and in India cattle contribute significantly to their diet. Unusual prey items include porcupines and small reptiles. Lions will kill other predators such as leopards, cheetahs, and hyenas, but they seldom devour them.|$|E

Common duiker, bushbuck, warthog, <b>vervet</b> <b>monkey</b> and Kinda baboon (related to the yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus)) are common throughout the park and hippo can frequently be encountered in Kasanka’s rivers and lakes, including in Lake Wasa, opposite the main lodge.

2500|$|Many animals {{communicate}} through vocalization. Vocal communication serves many purposes, including mating rituals, warning calls, conveying location of food sources, and social learning. In {{a number of}} species, males perform calls during mating rituals {{as a form of}} competition against other males and to signal females.
