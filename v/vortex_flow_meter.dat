The aim of this work is to find a reliable and accurate approach to transient studies of the internal flow field in a <b>vortex</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter.</b> An initial investigation is made, based on simulation results from a cylinder in cross-flow, which is comparable to a vortex generating rod in a <b>vortex</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter.</b> The dependency of turbulence models, spatial resolution and wall functions are investigated. Next, a fully synthetic boundary condition is developed to enable efficient and realistic inlet boundary conditions for applications where cyclic boundary conditions are not applicable, e. g. for vortex flow meters. Finally, the outcome from the initial study on the cylinder in cross-flow, and findings during the work with the inlet boundary condition, serves as a base for decision making when a <b>vortex</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> model is investigated. The results from a LES simulation and two Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) measurements on a <b>vortex</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> model are compared.

50|$|Some designs {{require that}} only {{lubricating}} fluid be measured, because the rotors {{are exposed to}} the fluid. PD meters differ from turbine meters in that they handle medium and high-viscosity liquids well. For this reason, they are often used to measure the flow of hydraulic fluids. Compared with orifice-type meters, PD meters require very little straight upstream piping since they are not sensitive to uneven flow distribution across the area of the pipe. Positive displacement <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> can provide better relative accuracy at low flows than orifice-type <b>flow</b> <b>meters.</b> However, a positive displacement meter can be considerably heavier and more costly than non-positive-displacement types such as orifice plates, magnetic or <b>vortex</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} imposed {{pulsations}} on {{the output of}} five 3 ”-industrial vortex flow meters with a triangular bluff body and various type of sensors was experimentally investigated in a gas flow {{over a wide range}} of frequencies from 20 Hz to 400 Hz and amplitudes ranging from 1 % to 30 % rms of the average flow. During the experimental tests, the impact of pulsation frequencies and amplitudes on the accuracy of the measured flow output could be obtained separately within nearly the full range of operation of the <b>vortex</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter.</b> Large systematic errors in the measured <b>vortex</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> output were observed when the vortex frequencies were near the pulsation frequency. Even larger errors were measured at half the pulsation frequency. Lock-in occurred already at very low pulsation amplitudes in the order of 3 % rms of the average flow. The ISO/TR 3313 regards this flow as steady since the flow pulsations are less than 5 % rms. The output error due to flow pulsations observed is mainly negative. It has been observed that, in general, vortex flow meters are insensitive for flow pulsations when the pulsation frequency is a factor 3 less than the vortex shedding frequency. Even in presence of pulsations with amplitudes of 30 % an accuracy of 1 % can be obtained in this region. Concluding, it can be stated that one should be careful with the use of vortex flow meters when flow pulsations are present near the metering section with a frequency within or nearby the operating range of the flow meter...|$|E

A robust meter was designed to measure liquid flows at downhole conditions.

40|$|The need {{to measure}} flow rates in fluids is {{large in the}} world today. Many are the {{applications}} where {{a more or less}} accurate measurement is needed, e. g. gasoline pipe, district heating, medical flows and flows in the manufacturing industry. One way to measure flow velocities that is commonly used is with vortex shedding flow meters. These flow meters detect the vortices behind a bluff body in a flow in different ways, one way is by transit time ultrasonics. Since, normally, the sing around-ultrasonic is a more accurate way to measure flow velocity the theory behind this thesis is that a vortex shedder flow meter with sing-around ultrasonics should be more accurate than the ones with transit-time. A <b>vortex</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> is modeled with FEMLAB to give simulated data for the signal processing, and then the data is processed in MATLAB. The zero-crossing algorithm and the fast Fourier transform are applied to find the vortex frequency. In this stage {{it seems as if the}} sampling frequency is too small to detect the vortex frequencies. The final step is to make a <b>vortex</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> to confirm the theoretical model. The bluff body is built around ultrasonic transducers from D-flow technology AB. The flow meter is inserted to the water laboratory at Luleå University of Technology and measurements are done that is later evaluated and compared to the simulation results. In the real model the vortex frequency is discovered for the lower velocities, but the signal processing used in this thesis is not sufficient to give accurate frequencies for the higher velocities. Two big conclusions are made, that the theoretical model is not good enough and that the vortex frequency is present in the measured signal but could not be found with the algorithms at hand.

40|$|A robust {{fibre optic}} flow sensor has been {{developed}} to measure liquid or gas flows at ambient temperatures up to 300 °C and pressures up to 100 bar. While such environmental conditions are typical in pressurized steam systems in {{the oil and gas}} industry (downhole and surface), wider applications are envisaged. The flow sensor uses a specially-designed bluff body to generate vortex-induced pressure fluctuations as a function of flow. The pressure fluctuations result in mechanical strain fluctuations in the sensor plate which is attached to the bluff-body. This is detected by means of a Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG). The frequency of the pressure fluctuations is proportional to the flow velocity and is measured by analyzing the spectrum of the FBG sensor signal. Flow velocity measurements ranging from ~ 1 m/s to ~ 25 m/s have been demonstrated. Special mechanical design, gluing and packaging processes have been developed to enable applications at high temperatures and high pressures (HPHT). Although the working principle is the same as for conventional <b>vortex</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> this <b>flow</b> sensor does not require electronics, which is a great advantage at high temperatures. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) ...|$|R

40|$|Flow {{measurement}} {{is one of}} {{the mostly}} measured physical quantities in industry. It is of great economic importance. Pressure losses by measuring devices must be avoided and measurement errors should be as small as possible. These conditions are fulfilled with ultrasonic gas flow meter. The problem up to now was the difficult signal processing of the complex modulated ultrasonic signals. Two types of flow meter by means of ultrasound, cross correlation meter and <b>vortex</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> respectively, are thoroughly researched in this work. The signal processing is based on the interaction between ultrasound and turbulences, from which the ultrasound is modulated both in phase and amplitude. Analytic signal is used to model the complex modulation based on which the Hilbert Transform is introduced. The reconstructed signals through software Hilbert Transform not only keep a good result dealing with phase modulation part but also yield fairly good results when dealing with amplitude modulation part in cross correlation measurement. It is believed that the applitude modulation signal is not applicable for measurement, which is a conclusion drawn {{in the case of the}} common Quadrature Amplitude Demodulation(QAD). Demodulation is traditionally carried out by QAD. Extended Kalman Filter is applied to make demodulation in this dissertation. It is not only used in phase but also amplitude demodulation. This method, taking advantage of the same information required by using QAD, yields better demodulation results with less noise and overcomes the disadvantages such as phase jumping at high velocities using QAD. The combination of cross correlation method with vortex method forms a self-monitoring system and overcomes the systematic error of pure cross correlation method resulting in less uncertainty and higher reliability. Inclination of bluff body in vortex flow measurement is investigated and the measurement in disturbed flow is also initially studied...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{compares the}} results from a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) {{and the result of}} two Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) measurements. The work focuses on a model of a <b>vortex</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> a common flow meter type in process industry. Its {{measuring}} principle is that the frequency of a vortex street, generated by a shedder bar, is acquired by pressure or velocity sensors. The shedding frequency is proportional to the bulk flow rate. Tests are performed at a Reynolds number of 61400, based on the pipe diameter. A complementary LDV measurement is also performed at a Reynolds number of 62800. All results are normalized with the bulk velocity to be comparable to each other. A comparison of the mean streamwise velocity profiles shows excellent agreement between the numerical and experimenta l methods. The variance of the two velocity components is also in good agreement between the in vestigated results. It is shown {{that it is possible to}} capture the vortex shedding frequency by analysis of primary LDV data at the investigated Reynolds number. Velocity fluctuations due to secondary vortices are highlighted both in the LES and LDV results. Post-processing of the frequency spectra is implemented utilizing Bayesian probability theory which strengthens the dominating frequencies and attenuates the noise. The fundamental shedding frequencies found by nu merical and experimental methods are shown to be within the limits of theoretical estimations. The redundant results strengthens the reliability of each individual method. The results from flow simulations and measurements are assoc iated with uncertainties. The different types of uncertainty contributions are described and the results are evaluated taking calculated uncertainty contributions into account. For the LDV cases, estimated uncertainty con- tributions from the test setup, are included in the end results...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} flow {{measuring}} techniques applied on steady and pulsatingflows. Specifically, it {{is focused on}} gas flows where density changes canbe significant, i. e. compressible flows. In such flows only the mass flow ratehas a significance and not the volume flow rate since the latter depends onthe pressure. The motivation {{for the present study}} is found in the use of flowmeters for various purposes in the gas exchange system for internal combustionengines. Applications can be found for instance regarding measurements of airflow to the engine, or measurements of the amount of exhaust gas recirculation. However the scope of thesis is wider than this, since the thesis aims toinvestigate the response of flow meters to pulsating flows. The study is mainlyexperimental, but it also includes an introduction and discussion of several inindustry, common flow measuring techniques. The flow meters were studied using a newly developed flow rig, designedfor measurement of steady and pulsating air flow of mass flow rates and pulsefrequencies typically found in the gas exchange system of cars and smallertrucks. Flow rates are up to about 200 g/s and pulsation frequencies from 0 Hz(i. e. steady flow) up to 80 Hz. The study included the following flow meters:hot-film mass flow meter, venturi flowmeter, Pitot tube, vortex flowmeter andturbine flowmeter. The performance of these meters were evaluated at bothsteady and pulsating conditions. Furthermore, the flow under both steady andpulsating conditions were characterized by means of a resistance-wire basedmass flow meter, with the ability to perform time resolved measurements ofboth the mass flux ρu, and the stagnation temperature T 0. Experiments shows that, for certain flow meters, a quasi-steady assumptionis fairly well justified at pulsating flow conditions. This means that thefundamental equations describing the steady flow, for each instant of time,is applicable also in the pulsating flow. In the set-up, back-flow occurred atcertain pulse frequencies, which can result in highly inaccurate output fromcertain flow meters, depending on the measurement principle. For the purposeof finding means to determine when back flow prevails, LDV measurementswere also carried out. These measurements were compared with measurementsusing a <b>vortex</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> together with a new signal processing technique basedon wavelet analysis. The comparison showed that this technique may have apotential to measure pulsating flow rates accurately.

40|$|Commercially {{available}} flowmeters {{are provided}} with a calibration certificate, based on stationary flow conditions and {{do not include the}} impact of installation effects like swirl, a-symmetry, and piping and flow dynamics. Flow pulsations, valve noise and mechanical pipe vibrations can have a considerable impact on flowmeter accuracy in gas as well as in liquid flows. International standards like ISO, AGA and API, available for several flowmeter principles, sometimes refer to swirl, flow and piping dynamic effects, though they do not specify allowable amplitudes or frequencies. Investigations on the impact of piping and flow dynamics on differential pressure, turbine, vortex and Coriolis flowmeters have been published at several occasions. Ultrasonic noise of control valves is well known as a potential source of errors on ultrasonic flowmeters. The impact of mechanical pipe vibrations on vortex and Coriolis flowmeters can result in large errors if vibrations occur in the operating range of the flowmeter.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} flow {{measuring}} techniques applied to steady and pulsating gas flows relevant to gas exchange systems for internal combustion engines. Gas flows in such environments are complex, i. e. they are inhomogeneous, three-dimensional, unsteady, non-isothermal and exhibit significant density changes. While {{a variety of}} flow metering devices are available and have been devised for such flow conditions, the performance of these flow metersis {{to a large extent}} undocumented when a strongly pulsatile motion is superposed on the already complex flow field. Nonetheless, gas flow meters are commonly applied in such environments, e. g. in the measurement of the air flow to the engine or the amount of exhaust gas recirculation. The aim of the present thesis is therefore to understand and assess, and if possible to improve the performance of various flow meters under highly pulsatile conditions as well as demonstrating the use of a new type of flow meter for measurements of the pulsating mass flow upstream and downstream the turbine of a turbocharger. The thesis can be subdivided into three parts. The first one assesses the flow quality of a newly developed flow rig, designed for measurements of steady and pulsating air flow at flow rates and pulse frequencies typically found in the gas exchange system of cars and smaller trucks. Flow rates and pulsation frequencies achieved and measured range up to about 200 g/s and 80 Hz, respectively. The time-resolved mass flux and stagnation temperature under both steady and pulsating conditions were characterized by means of a combined hot/cold-wire probe which is part of a newly developed automated measurement module. This rig and measurement module were used to create a unique data base with well-defined boundary conditions to be used for the validation of numerical simulations, but in particular, to assess the performance of various flow meters. In the second part a novel <b>vortex</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> that can measure the timedependent flow rate using wavelet analysis has been invented, verified and extensively tested under various industrially relevant conditions. The newly developed technique was used to provide unique turbine maps under pulsatile conditions through time-resolved and simultaneous measurements of mass flow, temperature and pressure upstream and downstream the turbine. Results confirm that the quasi-steady assumption is invalid for the turbine considered as a whole. In the third and last part of the thesis, two basic fundamental questions that arose during the course of hot/cold-wire measurements in the aforementioned high speed flows have been addressed, namely to assess which temperature a cold-wire measures or to which a hot-wire is exposed to in high speed flows as well as whether the hot-wire measures the product of velocity and density or total density. Hot/cold-wire measurements in a nozzle have been performed to test various hypothesis and results show that the recovery temperature as well as the product of velocity and stagnation density are measured.
