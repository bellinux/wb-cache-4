25|$|Generalizing from static {{electricity}} to electromagnetism, {{we have a}} second potential, the magnetic <b>vector</b> <b>potential</b> A, which can also undergo gauge transformations. These transformations may be local. That is, rather than adding a constant onto V, one can add a function that takes on different values {{at different points in}} space and time. If A is also changed in certain corresponding ways, then the same E and B fields result. The detailed mathematical relationship between the fields E and B and the potentials V and A is given in the article Gauge fixing, along with the precise statement {{of the nature of the}} gauge transformation. The relevant point here is that the fields remain the same under the gauge transformation, and therefore Maxwell's equations are still satisfied.|$|E
25|$|The Little-Parks {{effect was}} {{discovered}} in 1962 in experiments with empty and thin-walled superconducting cylinders subjected to a parallel magnetic field. The electrical resistance of such cylinders shows a periodic oscillation with the magnetic flux through the cylinder, the period being h/2e= 2.07×10−15 V·s. The explanation provided by William Little and Ronald Parks is that the resistance oscillation reflects a more fundamental phenomenon, i.e. periodic oscillation of the superconducting critical temperature (Tc). This is the temperature at which the sample becomes superconducting. The Little-Parks effect {{is a result of}} collective quantum behavior of superconducting electrons. It reflects the general fact that it is the fluxoid rather than the flux which is quantized in superconductors. The Little-Parks effect demonstrates that the <b>vector</b> <b>potential</b> couples to an observable physical quantity, namely the superconducting critical temperature.|$|E

40|$|Adiabatic time {{evolution}} of degenerate eigenstates of a quantum system {{provides a means}} for controlling electronic states since mixing between degenerate levels generates a matrix Berry phase.

This double degeneracy can generate non-Abelian <b>vector</b> <b>potentials</b> when odd number of electrons are present.

25|$|It is even {{possible}} to have cases in which an experiment's results differ when the potentials are changed, even if no charged particle is ever exposed to a different field. One such example is the Aharonov–Bohm effect, shown in the figure. In this example, turning on the solenoid only causes a magnetic field B to exist within the solenoid. But the solenoid has been positioned so that the electron cannot possibly pass through its interior. If one believed that the fields were the fundamental quantities, then {{one would expect that}} the results of the experiment would be unchanged. In reality, the results are different, because turning on the solenoid changed the <b>vector</b> <b>potential</b> A in the region that the electrons do pass through. Now that it has been established that it is the potentials V and A that are fundamental, and not the fields E and B, we can see that the gauge transformations, which change V and A, have real physical significance, rather than being merely mathematical artifacts.|$|E

Problems in this theory serve to solution QCD problems and are connected with description of quark’s motion inside hadrons or any other limited space volume. Since QCD has confinement property, presumably, {{it will be better}} to consider QCD problems in a finite volume as well [11]. As known, there are color background field in QCD vacuum [13] and so, it has sense to study the problem of motion of colored particle in color background in limited space volume. Most simple case, the constant color background could be given by two different type of <b>vector</b> <b>potentials</b> [1, 2].
