5|$|A more {{well-known}} {{source of}} constellation myth are {{the texts of}} the Greeks and Romans. The origin of their constellations remains a matter of <b>vigorous</b> and occasionally fractious debate.|$|E
5|$|A <b>vigorous</b> {{tropical}} depression {{moved through the}} Cape Verde islands on September13, although the complete history of the cyclone is unknown. It dissipated before affecting the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|Alcohol {{acts as a}} {{magnesium}} diuretic, {{causes a}} prompt, <b>vigorous</b> increase in the urinary excretion of magnesium and other electrolytes.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to ripeness levels, the harvest yields {{can also have}} a strong influence in the resulting quality and flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The vine itself is prone to <b>vigorous</b> yields, particularly when planted on the <b>vigorous</b> SO4 rootstock. Excessive yields can result in less concentrated and flavorful wine with flavors more on the green or herbaceous side. In the 1970s, a particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon that was engineered to be virus free was noted for its very high yields-causing many quality conscious producers to replant their vineyards in the late 20th century with different clonal varieties. To reduce yields, producers can plant the vines on less <b>vigorous</b> rootstock and also practice green harvesting with aggressive pruning of grape clusters soon after veraison.|$|E
5|$|Nobel laureate Paul Krugman also {{actively}} {{argued the}} case for <b>vigorous</b> Keynesian intervention in the economy in his columns for The New York Times.|$|E
5|$|The {{discussion}} on dance movements is compiled by six categories — mimetic (natya), delicate (lasya), <b>vigorous</b> (tandava), acrobatic (visama), ludicrious (vikata) and graceful (laghu).|$|E
5|$|Two {{series of}} {{nitrogen}} oxohalides are known: the nitrosyl halides (XNO) and the nitryl halides (XNO2). The first are very reactive gases {{that can be}} made by directly halogenating nitrous oxide. Nitrosyl fluoride (NOF) is colourless and a <b>vigorous</b> fluorinating agent. Nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) behaves {{in much the same way}} and has often been used as an ionising solvent. Nitrosyl bromide (NOBr) is red. The reactions of the nitryl halides are mostly similar: nitryl fluoride (FNO2) and nitryl chloride (ClNO2) are likewise reactive gases and <b>vigorous</b> halogenating agents.|$|E
5|$|A {{short man}} {{but with a}} strong build, as a batsman he was a <b>vigorous</b> hooker and a wristy cutter, scoring mostly square of the wicket. He was {{particularly}} good against spin bowling, even on difficult pitches.|$|E
5|$|After {{attending}} {{a series of}} NFL Europa training camps, he gained a professional contract with German NFL Europa side Hamburg Sea Devils in March 2007. Following news that Chambers was receiving new, legal nutritional supplements from Victor Conte, the Hamburg Sea Devils confirmed that Chambers would undergo a <b>vigorous</b> drug testing regime.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten minutes}} {{interval}} {{the ball was}} again put in play, this time being kicked off by the Cliftons. The rest period had apparently stiffened the Cliftons, for the Academy making a <b>vigorous</b> spurt got the ball thru them, and Street, following it up well, scored a touchdown for the Academy.|$|E
5|$|Chantenay carrots. Although {{the roots}} are shorter than other cultivars, they have <b>vigorous</b> foliage and greater girth, being broad in the {{shoulders}} and tapering towards a blunt, rounded tip. They store well, have a pale-coloured core and are mostly used for processing. Cultivars include 'Carson Hybrid' and 'Red Cored Chantenay'.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the first}} half, by much rushing, forcing, snapbacks and <b>vigorous</b> bullyragging Riggs, the huge Hopkins quarterback, crashed over the goal line for 4 points. Paul Dashiell converted. Riggs {{repeated}} his performance but Dashiell missed conversion. Navy then adopted the Hopkins rushing tactics and Stone went over for the first score.|$|E
5|$|Henry le Despenser {{continued}} to be controversial after his fighting career was over, {{mainly because of the}} <b>vigorous</b> methods he used to maintain control over the laity in his diocese and his own cathedral church. He defended the orthodoxy of the church against Lollardy as passionately as he defended his episcopal rights and privileges.|$|E
5|$|Imperator carrots. This {{cultivar}} has <b>vigorous</b> foliage, is of high sugar content, and {{has long}} and slender roots, tapering to a pointed tip. Imperator types {{are the most}} widely cultivated by commercial growers. Cultivars include 'Imperator 58' and 'Sugarsnax Hybrid'.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, Teller became {{especially}} {{known for his}} advocacy of controversial technological solutions to both military and civilian problems, including a plan to excavate an artificial harbor in Alaska using thermonuclear explosive in what was called Project Chariot. He was a <b>vigorous</b> advocate of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E
5|$|Lastarria {{is formed}} by two {{volcanic}} edifices and one subsidiary lava flow field. There is no recorded eruptive activity, but the volcano displays <b>vigorous</b> fumarolic activity. It {{is located on}} top of older volcanic rocks and features both andesite and dacite.|$|E
5|$|Maximinus {{also worked}} for a revival of pagan religion. He {{appointed}} high priests for each province, men who were to wear white robes and supervise daily worship of the gods. Maximinus also demanded that <b>vigorous</b> restoration work be done on decaying temples within his domain.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn was renowned {{during his}} {{lifetime}} as a keyboard performer, both on the piano and on the organ. One of his obituarists noted:First and chiefest we esteem his pianoforte-playing, with its amazing elasticity of touch, rapidity, and power; next his scientific and <b>vigorous</b> organ playing his triumphs on these instruments are fresh in public recollection.|$|E
5|$|Pericles {{marked a}} whole era and {{inspired}} conflicting judgments about his significant decisions. The {{fact that he}} was {{at the same time a}} <b>vigorous</b> statesman, general and orator makes more complex the objective assessment of his actions.|$|E
5|$|Skarga {{is remembered}} by Poles as a <b>vigorous</b> early {{advocate}} of reforms to the Polish-Lithuanian polity, {{and as a}} critic of the Commonwealth's governing classes, as well as of its religious tolerance policies. He advocated strengthening the monarch's power at the expense of parliament (the Sejm) and of the nobility (the szlachta).|$|E
5|$|Telopea 'Shade of Pale' is {{an unusual}} pale-pink flowered form of T.speciosissima. It is less <b>vigorous</b> than the parent plant. It was {{initially}} promoted as 'Light Shade of Pale' but there can only be three words in a registered cultivar name.|$|E
5|$|A <b>vigorous</b> {{tropical}} wave {{organized into}} Tropical Depression Seventeen on September 17 {{a few hundred}} miles east of the Leeward Islands. It was upgraded to a tropical storm late that evening. This marked the third time that the 'P' name had been used to name an Atlantic storm since alphabetical naming began in 1950. The previous times were for Pablo in 1995 and Peter in 2003. In subsequent seasons, 'P' names would be given to Paloma in 2008, Paula in 2010, Philippe in 2011, and Patty in 2012.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Belarus {{was among}} the 51 {{founding}} countries of the United Nations Charter and as such it was allowed an additional vote at the UN, {{on top of the}} Soviet Union's vote. <b>Vigorous</b> postwar reconstruction promptly followed {{the end of the war}} and the Byelorussian SSR became a major center of manufacturing in western USSR, creating jobs and attracting ethnic Russians. The borders of the Byelorussian SSR and Poland were redrawn and became known as the Curzon Line.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was never}} a <b>vigorous</b> apologist for that tradition, he always {{maintained}} the standards of clarity and rigour which it prizes, and his work {{is a model of}} all that is best in the tradition. It is brilliant, deep, and imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some objection to what he says, only to find, on looking for a relevant quotation to turn into a target, that Williams carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates the objection.|$|E
5|$|At {{its peak}} of popularity, the Large Black was used mainly for meat production, {{especially}} bacon. The {{meat from the}} Large Black {{is known for its}} lean quality and flavour without an excess of back fat, but for commercial production it was often crossed with the Yorkshire and Middle White pigs, producing a <b>vigorous</b> hybrid that was well regarded by farmers. However, today commercial processors do not favour the black skin of the purebred Large Black.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Hudson {{suggested}} {{that it was only}} the <b>vigorous</b> campaigning by Niall Glúndub in Ulster and Connacht from 913 to 915, along with Óengus's fortuitous death, that led to Niall being named Flann's heir. Alex Woolf {{suggested that}} Flann had not only attempted to monopolise the succession within his family, but had come close to instituting a national kingship in Ireland comparable to that created by his contemporaries Alfred the Great and Edward the Elder in England from their Kingdom of Wessex.|$|E
5|$|Bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) {{was first}} {{synthesised}} in 1930. It is produced {{on a large}} scale by direct reaction of bromine with excess fluorine at temperatures higher than 150°C, and on a small scale by the fluorination of potassium bromide at 25°C. It is a very <b>vigorous</b> fluorinating agent, although chlorine trifluoride is still more violent. Bromine pentafluoride explodes on reaction with water and fluorinates silicates at 450°C.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{was awarded}} an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Harvard University in 1851. Later that year, he acted as Secretary of State during the illness of Daniel Webster. In this capacity, {{he wrote a}} <b>vigorous</b> warning to both Britain and France about interfering in the {{question}} of Cuban independence. He also encouraged adherence to the United States' traditional policy of non-interference in Europe during the celebrated visit of Hungarian revolutionary Louis Kossuth to the United States in 1851.|$|E
5|$|Delayed by {{the change}} to the rules, McCool had a five-year stint from 1956 in English county cricket. Somerset, having {{finished}} {{on the bottom of}} the County Championship table for the four years between 1952–1955, had embarked on a renewal programme. Part of the programme involved a <b>vigorous</b> recruiting campaign, including an offer to McCool that saw him return to first-class cricket at the age of 39.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, Loxton {{also became}} more disillusioned with cricket, as player {{behaviour}} deteriorated and incidences of verbal hostility and altercations increased. The former all-rounder {{was known for}} his <b>vigorous</b> advocacy of the more sedate and gentlemanly conduct that existed during his playing days and felt that he and his fellow administrators were losing control of the sport.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Sikorski became Prime Minister of the Polish Government in Exile, Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces, and a <b>vigorous</b> {{advocate}} of the Polish cause in the diplomatic sphere. He supported the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between Poland and the Soviet Union, which had been severed after the Soviet pact with Germany and the 1939 invasion of Poland— however, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin broke off Soviet-Polish diplomatic relations in April 1943 following Sikorski's request that the International Red Cross investigate the Katyń Forest massacre.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy is a {{group of}} {{neurological}} disorders characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of <b>vigorous</b> shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur and as a rule, have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition.|$|E
5|$|Erosion {{within the}} last century has {{resulted}} in a falls that is fairly narrowly channeled and <b>vigorous,</b> notably after a heavy rain. Photographs of the waterfall from the 19th century show a much wider, curtain like character to the falls. When the creek is dry, the older, much-broader ledge can be observed. If there were sufficient interest and funding, some remedial work could theoretically restore the 19th century appearance of the falls.|$|E
5|$|Following the Japanese raid on Ceylon of March–April 1942, the Eastern Fleet was {{transferred}} from its base at Trincomalee, {{to the other}} side of the Indian Ocean: Kilindi in Kenya. From there the fleet undertook local patrols, escorted convoys and occasionally despatched ships to operations in the Mediterranean. During Operation <b>Vigorous,</b> a convoy to Malta in June 1942, Nestor was serious damaged in an air raid and slowly sank.|$|E
5|$|Further {{works were}} carried out to repair, rebuild and improve the defences around the Waterport Front, which {{incorporated}} the old Waterport Gate. New casemates, counterguards, tenailles and lunettes {{were built in the}} area and the Montagu and Orange Bastions were enlarged. The work was carried out amidst considerable controversy, as there were <b>vigorous</b> disagreements between the governors and senior engineers of the time over how the works should be carried out and indeed whether some of them should be pursued at all.|$|E
5|$|Further, {{the earth}} goddess Bhudevi {{falls in love}} with her rescuer Varaha. Vishnu - in his Varaha form - marries Bhudevi, making her one of the consorts of Vishnu. In one narrative, Vishnu and Bhudevi indulge in <b>vigorous</b> embraces and as a result, Bhudevi becomes {{fatigued}} and faints, sinking a little in the primordial ocean. Vishnu again acquires the form of Varaha and rescues her, reinstating her in her original position above the waters. Some scriptures state that Bhudevi gives birth to Varaha's son, an asura called Narakasura.|$|E
