5|$|The {{carriage}} house, {{today the}} Ellwood House Museum's Education and <b>Visitors</b> <b>Center,</b> {{was built by}} Perry Ellwood as a multi-car garage. It had a grease pit for automobile repair work. On the second floor was an apartment for the Ellwood family chauffeur.

The original doors are on display inside the Ellwood House <b>Visitors</b> <b>Center.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Museum House is cast in Classical Revival {{style and}} was the last {{outbuilding}} constructed for Isaac Ellwood on the property. Today the Museum House's exterior appears {{much the same as}} it did when it was newly constructed but for many years the structure was badly deteriorated. After Harriet Ellwood died in 1910 the objects remained inside the building while it began to decline. By 1934 the building was in serious need of repair and by the 1970s both porches were gone and the only way into the building was through the north door. The museum house restoration was undertaken more than ten years later. Prior to the addition of the <b>Visitors</b> <b>Center</b> to the Carriage House, the Museum House served as the <b>visitors</b> <b>center</b> and housed staff offices.|$|E

Lowell Observatory continues to be an active astronomical observatory and a popular <b>visitors</b> <b>center</b> which hosts educational displays and tours. It has a distributed network of small telescopes which together create images of celestial bodies with much higher resolutions than any other single telescope can produce. Current research is involved in observations of near-Earth phenomena such as asteroids and comets. The observatory is also involved in a $30 million project with the Discovery Channel to build the Discovery Channel Telescope, a sophisticated, ground-based telescope with advanced optical capabilities for future projects. Lowell Observatory and NOFS are also collaborators on the major project, the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer, on nearby Anderson Mesa. NOFS is heavily involved with the science of star catalogs and astrometry, or the positions and distances of stars and celestial objects.|$|E
5|$|Starting at the easternmost Nevada exit of I-80, BL-80 heads south, {{concurrent}} with US93Alt. {{until it}} intersects with, and turns east onto, Wendover Boulevard. Just {{west of the}} intersection, the highway passes the West Wendover City Hall, which houses the West Wendover Municipal Court and Eastline Justice Court.

5|$|The {{shooting}} led to {{the creation}} of the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund, a nonprofit organization managed by the Capitol Police Board which provides funds for the families of Chestnut and Gibson. In November 2005, the fund was expanded to include the family of Sgt. Christopher Eney, a USCP officer killed during a training accident in 1984. The shooting was cited as one reason for the development of the Capitol <b>Visitors</b> <b>Center.</b> The legislation authorizing the construction of the facility was introduced by Washington, D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and was entitled the Jacob Joseph Chestnut-John Michael Gibson United States Capitol Visitor Center Act of 1998. The door where Weston entered was renamed in honor of the two officers, from the Document Door to the Chestnut-Gibson Memorial Door.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to {{identify}} the key element in Tasmanian interpretive <b>visitor</b> <b>center</b> planning and design. The chapter begins by describing <b>visitor</b> <b>centers</b> in the Tasmanian context {{and the role of}} interpretation. The Strahan <b>Visitor</b> <b>Center</b> is introduced next, followed by a description of its interpretive experience. The next section details the research strategy adopted. Key informant interviews are used as a base on which to overlay the case study results and discussion. The discussion is made up of seven main sections and begins by introducing the proposition that interpretation within <b>visitor</b> <b>centers</b> is fundamentally a secondary visitor experience. This is followed by a brief review of how interpretation should be promoted in <b>visitor</b> <b>centers.</b> The chapter concludes by highlighting a number of factors contributing to more sustainable interpretive <b>visitor</b> <b>centers</b> and the implications of the findings for future research...|$|R
