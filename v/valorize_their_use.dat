30|$|We {{observe the}} {{emergent}} sense-making that creates boundaries between workers of different origins, drawing on ethnographic data gathered over an eleven week period by Wu, who worked alongside {{urban and rural}} service employees at a retail store in Beijing. We show that boundaries between workers are reproduced and elaborated through three mechanisms: (1) administratively determined division of jobs, (2) extra-organizational collective identities that workers draw on to <b>valorize</b> <b>their</b> labor, and (3) third party (customer) preferences. Throughout their workplace struggles, workers draw upon a discourse promulgated by the state that promotes individual “quality”. They implicitly and explicitly refer to this suzhi discourse in order to convert cultural capital into workplace “service” capital. Thus, the state acts as kind of symbolic broker in these struggles, while customers are real brokers, expressing preferences for urban workers and against rural workers. The formation of service floor boundaries is also conditioned by macro structural dynamics that exclude migrant workers from urban citizenship. The focus on boundaries illuminates a problematic mode of worker agency, as workers mobilize resources {{against each other in}} their contention for status and dignity in the workplace (Hodson 2001).|$|R

5000|$|Low-Status WorkMany low-wage {{service sector}} jobs require {{a great deal}} of {{customer}} service work. Although not all customer service jobs are low-wage or low-status, many of them are. Some argue that the low status nature of some jobs can have negative psychological effects on workers, [...] but others argue that low status workers come up with coping mechanisms that allow them to maintain a strong sense of self-worth. [...] One of these coping mechanisms is called boundary work. Boundary work happens when one group of people <b>valorize</b> <b>their</b> own social position by comparing themselves to another group, who they perceive to be inferior in some way. For example, Newman (1999) found that fast food workers in New York City cope with the low-status nature of their job by comparing themselves to the unemployed, who they perceive to be even lower-status than themselves. Thus, although the low-status nature of working poor people's jobs may have some negative psychological effects, some, but probably not all, of these negative effects can be counteracted through coping mechanisms such as boundary work.|$|R

By introducing Confucianism, Lie proposed that the Chinese reconnect themselves with China as an alternative patronage which could subvert White supremacy. Instead of using sources in Chinese, Lie translated the biography of Confucius from the European texts. In crafting his story, Lie applied conglomerate authorship, a technique commonly practised by Malay authors. It allowed him to select, combine and appropriate the source texts. To justify that Confucius' virtue and his teaching were superb and are applicable to contemporary life, Lie borrowed and emphasized European writers’ high appraisal of Confucianism, instead of using his own arguments and opinions.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{viability}} of shallow, unreinforced masonry domes for the roof and floor systems of residential construction. In recent years, reinforced concrete (RCC) framed construction has been established as the dominant structural form for residential and commercial usage in the developing world, with the flat two-way slab as the most common (almost universal in northern India) spanning solution for these designs. Over the same time period, local artisans in the Muzzafarnagar region of Uttar Pradesh in northern India have combined shallow brick vaulting techniques with an RCC tension ring as a small to medium scale spanning solution. While these vaults are a cost-effective alternative to a concrete slab roof/floor system, improperly designed and detailed masonry construction can prove dangerous, especially in seismic zones. This thesis is {{an exploration of the}} structural behavior and design of these domes, intended to produce broadly applicable design guidelines to ensure the strength and stability of this structural typology in order to <b>valorize</b> <b>their</b> broad usage, where appropriate, in India's housing sector.

Operating from a political economy approach rooted in institutional theory I investigate and compare the conditions, between 1970 and 2004, that influenced German and Canadian federal political leaders' motivation and capacity to design wind energy incentives for the private sector. I begin with a brief introduction that highlights {{the significance of this}} topic within the context of advanced industrial countries' policy landscape.

A detailed analysis of the supply conditions affecting German federal political leaders' willingness and ability to create wind energy incentives follows. I subsequently assess the supply conditions affecting Canadian federal political leaders' willingness and ability. I conclude by suggesting that political pressure on German leaders to address the climate change challenge <b>valorized</b> <b>their</b> perception of wind turbines, which in turn catalyzed their will to create attractive incentives for private investment in the wind industry. Conversely, the political and economic benefits for Canadian leaders to deregulate energy markets coupled with the low degree of political concern pertaining to climate change during the mid- 1980 s restricted their willingness. In both case studies federal political leaders' ability to implement their will was determined by the level of cooperation they received from political, energy and financial organization...|$|R

Both techniques {{are based on the}} con-cept that dairy farm wastewaters, as well as any other agricultural wastewater, are of low nutrient content and can be disposed off on relatively small cropped surfaces (0. 5 to 1. 0 ha). The first project consisted in developing and testing surface irrigation for the disposal of wastewaters on cropped land. A gated pipe is used to distribute wastewater over a length of 45 m and allowing this wastewater to run down the natural slope. This technique reduces the cost of wastewater disposal from $ 3 to $ 5 /m 3, to $ 1. 25 to $ 1. 50 /m 3. This technique requires a ground water control valve at the outlet of the subsurface drainage system, to elimi-nate the environmental impact of the direct loss of about 0. 25 % of the wastewater volume, during the irri-gation operation. Also, the irrigated plot must be rotated on a two year sequence to prevent soil K overlo-ading. The second project consisted in developing and testing a modified septic tank system for the treat-ment of milk house wastewaters. A grease trap was added before the septic tank and the seepage field was designed to cover 0. 45 ha of cropped land.

30|$|How do {{collective}} identities gain salience in the workplace? How are new “capitals” {{created in}} the process? To answer these question, this study examines the confrontation of two distinctly positioned socio-economic groups {{that for the first}} time labor as co-workers in urban China, in a new type of workspace; the modern retail store. One group is the urban service proletariat, who struggle to earn a living in precarious service jobs but have legal entitlement to urban residence and urban services. The other group is migrant employees who, as part of the largest migration in human history, join a tide of workers who originally departed their rural villages in the 1980 s to work in foreign-invested factories on China’s southeast coast, as well as in urban constructionl. These early migrants were largely sequestered from urbanites and excluded from permanent legal residence. Drawing on data from eleven weeks of ethnographic research in a retail work setting, we examine the process through which the spatial boundaries that once separated urbanites and rural migrants become socio-cultural boundaries. The process involves three conversion mechanisms: administratively determined division of jobs, extra-organizational collective identities that some workers draw on to <b>valorize</b> <b>their</b> labor, and third party (customer) preferences. We link these micro-level dynamics to state institutions and discourses. We show that workplace culture follows the contours of boundary formation, an organizational process in which workers collectively compete for status and material resources by converting their extramural identity to workplace recognition. These conversions produce “service capital” a resource that benefits urban workers. Through this boundary work, job tasks take on meaning beyond their bureaucratic designation, and job-based identities gain meaning in everyday life that become the cultural skin in which workers live.|$|R
40|$|Trafficking natural {{objects and}} {{trafficking}} cultural objects {{have been treated}} separately both in regulatory policy and in criminological discussion. The former is generally taken to be ‘wildlife crime’ while the latter {{has come to be}} considered under the auspices of a debate on ‘illicit art and antiquities’. In this article we study the narrative discourse of high-end collectors of orchids and antiquities. The illicit parts of these global trades are subject to this analytical divide between wildlife trafficking and art trafficking, and this has resulted in quite different regulatory structures for each of these markets. However, the trafficking routines, the types and levels of harm involved, and the supply–demand dynamics in the trafficking of orchids and antiquities are actually quite similar, and in this study we find those structural similarities reflected in substantial common ground in the way collectors talk about their role in each market. Collectors of rare and precious orchids and antiquities <b>valorize</b> <b>their</b> participation in markets that are known to be in quite considerable degree illicit, appealing to ‘higher loyalties’ such as preservation, appreciation of aesthetic beauty and cultural edification. These higher loyalties, along with other techniques of neutralization, deplete the force of law as a guide to appropriate action. We propose that the appeal to higher loyalties is difficult to categorize as a technique of neutralization in this study as {{it appears to be a}} motivational explanation for the collectors involved. The other classic techniques of neutralization are deflective, guilt and critique reducing narrative mechanisms, while higher loyalties drives illicit behaviour in collecting markets for orchids and antiquities in ways that go significantly beyond the normal definition of neutralization...|$|R
