25|$|The disc is {{acted upon}} by {{two sets of}} coils, which form, in effect, a two phase {{induction}} motor. One coil is connected {{in such a way}} that it produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the voltage and the other produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the current. The field of the <b>voltage</b> <b>coil</b> is delayed by 90 degrees, due to the coil's inductive nature, and calibrated using a lag coil. This produces eddy currents in the disc and the effect is such that a force is exerted on the disc in proportion to the product of the instantaneous current, voltage and phase angle (power factor) between them. A permanent magnet acts as an eddy current brake, exerting an opposing force proportional to the speed of rotation of the disc. The equilibrium between these two opposing forces results in the disc rotating at a speed proportional to the power or rate of energy usage. The disc drives a register mechanism which counts revolutions, much like the odometer in a car, in order to render a measurement of the total energy used.|$|E

50|$|A typical {{wattmeter}} {{in educational}} labs has two <b>voltage</b> <b>coils</b> (pressure coils) and a current coil. We can connect the two pressure coils in series or parallel {{to each other}} to change the ranges of the wattmeter. Another feature is that the pressure coil can also be tapped to change the meter's range. If the pressure coil has range of 300 volts, the half of it can be used so that the range becomes 150 volts.|$|R
50|$|It is {{desirable}} that the reactor {{does not go}} into magnetic saturation during a short-circuit, so generally an air-core coil is used. At low and medium <b>voltages,</b> air-insulated <b>coils</b> are practical; for high transmission <b>voltages,</b> the <b>coils</b> may be immersed in transformer oil. Installation of air-core coils requires consideration of the magnetic field produced by the coils, which may induce current in large nearby metal objects. This may result in objectionable temperature rise and waste of energy.|$|R

40|$|We herein show {{analytical}} {{solutions for}} output <b>voltage</b> and <b>coil</b> current in the conductive and non-conductive periods of the transistor switch in a step-down switching power supply.

5000|$|After Oudin {{combined}} {{the primary and}} [...] "resonator" [...] coil together on the same form, making them an air-core autotransformer, the only {{significant difference between the}} Tesla and Oudin apparatus was that the medical Tesla coil was [...] "bipolar" [...] while the Oudin coil was [...] "unipolar", with one end grounded. As time went on the meaning of the terms changed, until (by perhaps 1920) the term Tesla coil meant a [...] "bipolar" [...] coil; any high <b>voltage</b> <b>coil</b> with an ungrounded balanced secondary with two output terminals, while the term Oudin coil meant a [...] "unipolar" [...] coil; any coil with a grounded secondary and a single output terminal.|$|E
5000|$|A {{split-phase}} watthour meter has {{a stator}} with three coils facing the disc. The magnetic circuit is completed by a C-shaped core of permeable iron. The [...] "voltage" [...] coil above the disc is {{in parallel with}} the supply; its many turns have a high inductance/resistance ratio (Q) so its current and magnetic field are the time integral of the applied voltage, lagging it by 90 degrees. This magnetic field passes down perpendicularly through the disc, inducing circular eddy currents in {{the plane of the}} disc centered on the field. These induced currents are proportional to the time derivative of the magnetic field, leading it by 90 degrees. This puts the eddy currents in phase with the voltage applied to the <b>voltage</b> <b>coil,</b> just as the current induced in the secondary of a transformer with a resistive load is in phase with the voltage applied to its primary.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{electromechanical}} {{instrument is}} the polarized-vane type. In this instrument a stationary field coil produces a rotating magnetic field, {{just like a}} polyphase motor. The field coils are connected either directly to polyphase voltage sources or to a phase-shifting reactor if a single-phase application. [...] A second stationary field coil, perpendicular to the <b>voltage</b> <b>coils,</b> carries a current proportional to current in one phase of the circuit. The moving system of the instrument consists of two vanes that are magnetized by the current coil. In operation the moving vanes take up a physical angle equivalent to the electrical angle between the voltage source and the current source. This type of instrument {{can be made to}} register for currents in both directions, giving a four-quadrant display of power factor or phase angle.|$|R

5000|$|The eddy {{currents}} pass directly above the pole pieces of two [...] "current" [...] coils under the disc, each wound {{with a few}} turns of heavy-gauge wire whose inductive reactance is small compared to the load impedance. These coils connect the supply to the load, producing a magnetic field in phase with the load current. This field passes from the pole of one current coil up perpendicularly through the disc and back down through the disc to the pole of the other current coil, with a completed magnetic circuit {{back to the first}} current coil. As these fields cross the disc, they pass through the {{eddy currents}} induced in it by the <b>voltage</b> <b>coil</b> producing a Lorentz force on the disc mutually perpendicular to both. Assuming power is flowing to the load, the flux from the left current coil crosses the disc upwards where the eddy current flows radially {{toward the center of the}} disc producing (by the right hand rule) a torque driving the front of the disc to the right. Similarly, the flux crosses down through the disc to the right current coil where the eddy current flows radially away from the disc center, again producing a torque driving the front of the disc to the right. When the AC polarity reverses, the eddy currents in the disc and the direction of the magnetic flux from the current coils both change, leaving the direction of the torque unchanged.|$|E
