500|$|Much {{was made}} of Arsenal's policy of using the League Cup to field youngsters. In order to explain his team selection, Wenger made an analogy between his youth players and hopefuls on The X Factor, a {{television}} programme he admired. He ruled out playing his more experienced players for the match: [...] "We battled <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in this final {{and it would be}} a reward for this team, which has risen up to every challenge." [...] When contrasting the two teams, Wenger said: [...] "The game of Chelsea is based on experience and power, ours will be based on mobility and movement." [...] Mourinho did not anticipate Arsenal would make a [...] "crazy change" [...] to their team: [...] "Normally, they change players but keep their philosophy, their idea of football, their system." [...] He believed the final had the makings of a showpiece event as the competition was not a main target for both clubs; emotions therefore would not dictate matters.|$|E
500|$|Lucas North {{appears to}} be a person divided between who he was prior to his incarceration and who he has become since. Richard Armitage has {{described}} Lucas as [...] "very ambiguous, but quite open with everybody" [...] and [...] "a bit of a double-edged sword, so he's not completely white. He's a bit of a dark horse." [...] He is also described as having [...] "no knowledge of how damaged he is emotionally, until memories start to work their way to the surface." [...] Following his release from prison, glimpses of him adjusting to the outside world—such as a scene in episode two in which Lucas lies on the floor rather than in a bed in order to sleep—reveal to the audience how much he is struggling, though he keeps it hidden from his teammates. Lucas also fights <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accepted and to regain Harry's trust, but he does not always play by the rules. In the series seven finale, Lucas admits to having blamed Harry for his ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club reviewed the episode positively, rating it a B. He considered the episode [...] "entertaining to watch" [...] with [...] "nifty direction from Tucker Gates", despite being formulaic {{and with the}} same problems he found in the previous episode penned by John Shiban, season three's [...] "Teso Dos Bichos". Handlen had much praise for the second half, which he noted was filled with dark humor, and featured a [...] "bizarre ending". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it a 2 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode is a disastrous combination of political commentary and stereotypical “Mexican soap opera” caricatures. Mulder and Scully {{have nothing to do}} with the resolution of the episode, and in fact, the writers fail to provide that resolution. There are some good character moments, but they are too far and few between." [...] Author Keith Topping criticized the episode in his book X-Treme Possibilities, calling it an [...] "awful episode with a heavy-handed, clod-hopping attempt at social comment that hardly sits well with the themes on display in the rest of the episode." [...] He called it the worst episode of the fourth season. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five and wrote that it was [...] "trying <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> clever". Despite this the two explained that [...] "if cleverness were only about intent, then we could all be geniuses". Shearman and Pearson derided the episode's use of social criticism, referring to it as [...] "rubbish [...] only works if it isn't underlined each time it's made." [...] Furthermore, the two criticized the story's [...] "Mexican soap opera" [...] style, noting that it drowned out the themes in [...] "unengaging melodrama". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She wrote that [...] "'El Mundo Gira' is so overloaded with ideas that it falls over and can't get up".|$|E

Puyi had been so used to having his needs catered to that he never entirely learned how to function on his own. Puyi tried <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> modest and humble, always being {{the last person to}} board a bus, which meant that frequently missed the ride and in restaurants would tell the waitresses that [...] "You should not be serving me.

2500|$|Denver Post {{contributor}} Joanne Ostrow {{declared the}} protagonist of the series a [...] "female answer to SpongeBob SquarePants". Among the favorable reception was a mixed review from Common Sense Medias Emily Ashby. She said while it [...] "maintains a chaotic pace, {{and there are no}} real attempts to teach strong positive lessons [...] Young tweens will likely enjoy Bessie's outlandish, fantasy-fueled adventures– which are fast-paced and, on the surface, entertaining." [...] Ed Liu of Toon Zone called The Mighty B! a show that he admires more than what he [...] "truly love", stating: [...] "There is prodigious talent behind it and its wonderfully energetic, boisterous comedy. It's clearly trying very, <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> entertaining and largely succeeds [...] I almost feel bad for not liking The Mighty B! more than I do, and I'm still not sure why I don't enjoy it more". He noted it was worth pointing out that more recent episodes of the show seem [...] "more assured and funnier" [...] than the eight episodes on the We Got the Bee DVD.|$|E
2500|$|Some photographers {{have found}} {{creative}} ways around these limitations. Louie Liotta of The New York Post told John Tierney {{he holds his}} camera near the ground, pointing upward, and walks with it for a short distance, {{in order to get}} a shot of the defendant's face as he or she is ducking downwards to avoid the cameras. Andrew Savulich of the Daily News looks for unusual angles and juxtapositions, once putting the station house's sleeping cat in the foreground. To catch the defendant's face, he stands near the front door at the top of the steps. [...] "For some reason, even when a guy has decided to duck his head, he usually lifts it for a second when he starts to go down steps", he explains. [...] "You sometimes catch this lost-in-space look, the eyes fixed at a distance, as if he's trying <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> somewhere else." [...] Jim Estrin of the Times says the police officers at the door sometimes block that shot for him, so he starts in the middle, shooting as he runs, and then gets on the other side of the police car for a shot as the defendant enters.|$|E

2500|$|Saxony was {{a center}} of völkisch {{activity}} in the late 19th century, and in the elections to the Saxon Landtag in 1893, völkisch candidates won 6 out of the 16 seats. Chamberlain's status as an immigrant to Germany always meant he was {{to a certain extent}} an outsider in his adopted country-a man who spoke fluent German, but always with an English accent. In a classic case of being plus royaliste que le roi (more royalist than the kings), Chamberlain tried <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more German than the Germans, and it was his efforts to fit in that led him to völkisch politics. Likewise, his anti-Semitism allowed him to define himself as a German in opposition to a group that allegedly threatened all Germans, thereby allowing him to integrate better into the Wagnerian circles with whom he socialized most of the time. Chamberlain's friend Hermann Keyserling later recalled that Chamberlain was an eccentric English [...] "individualist" [...] who [...] "never saw Germany as it really is", instead having an idealized, almost mythic view of Germany and the Germans. This was especially the case as initially the German Wagnerites had rejected Chamberlain, telling him that only Germans could really understand Wagner, statements that very much hurt Chamberlain. To compensate, Chamberlain became über deutsche, the man who wanted to be more German than the Germans.|$|E
