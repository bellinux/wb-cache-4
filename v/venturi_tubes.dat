Differential pressure is measured between two segments of a <b>venturi</b> <b>tube</b> that have a different aperture.

The amount of that move can be calibrated to the speed of the fluid flow.|$|E

JA Prestwich at first would deliver the same engine to the aircraft manufacturer, allowing them to make local modifications - mainly larger <b>venturi</b> <b>tubes</b> for the carburettor, to allow for greater air intake at altitude.

40|$|Abstract. The flow {{measurement}} of primary air {{is very important}} for thermal power plants to maintain the safe state of operation. For direct firing pulverizing system, the measuring is essentially affected by pulverized coal particles. Abrasion and occlusion would bring great trouble to the measurement. Many measuring methods are invalid under that circumstance. Lots of efforts have been made to find appropriate ways to measure the flow of primary air containing pulverized coal. <b>Venturi</b> <b>tube</b> had been successfully used to measure the flow of air. If a <b>venturi</b> <b>tube</b> is used to measure the flow velocity of primary air, the differential pressure goes higher with the increase of the concentration of pulverized coal in the primary air. The neglect of the affection of pulverized coal on the measuring would result in remarkable deviation. With the aids of coal flow rate, a method of using <b>venturi</b> <b>tube</b> to measure the velocity of primary air containing pulverized coal was established. The affection of pulverized coal on flow measuring of primary air cannot be ignored...|$|R

There is some indication that this may also be done for single <b>venturi</b> <b>tubes.</b> For a given installation in which an air-driven instrument is connected through tubing with a venturi tube, the volume rate of induced air flow is approximately proportional to the product of indicated air speed and the square root of the ratio of standard to ambient air pressure. The efficiency of such a system at a given altitude is constant. Rather large variations in suction and efficiency were found for individual tubes of the same design. Cylindrical fairings on the external surface resulted in a reduction of both drag and suction but little change in efficiency...|$|E

A Venturi tube is a device which consists of a convergent inlet connected to a cylindrical throat which is in turn connected to a conical expanding section called the "divergent". The differences between the values of the uncertainty of the discharge coefficient for the three types of classical Venturi tube show, on the one hand, the number of results available for each type of classical Venturi tube and, on the other hand, the more or less precise definition of the geometric profile.

40|$|Abstract: Aeration is {{the process}} by which the area of contact between water and air is increased, either by natural methods or by {{mechanical}} devices. Proper aeration can make considerable improvements in a pond ecosystem. This paper investigates pond aeration by two phase flow systems such as high head gated conduit flow systems and two phase pipe flow systems using <b>venturi</b> <b>tubes.</b> When the gate of a high head outlet conduit is partly opened or a minimal amount of differential pressure exists between the inlet and outlet sides of the venturi tube, air suction occurs at air vents. In two phase flow systems, air that is entrained into the water will be momentarily forced downstream in the form of small air bubbles. The dissolution of oxygen into the water results from the air suction downstream of high head gated conduit and venturi tube, and the rising air bubbles into pond. Moreover, high pressure in two phase flow systems also facilitates the dissolution of oxygen into the water. Therefore, two phase flow systems have an extremely high efficiency for transferring oxygen from air bubbles to water. It was observed from the results that two phase flow systems were more efficient in deep ponds than in shallow ponds...|$|E
40|$|<b>Venturi</b> <b>tubes</b> and orifice {{plates are}} devices largely {{used in the}} {{petroleum}} industry for measuring multiphase flows. In the project and calibration of these flow meters, the homogeneous model is commonly used. This model calculates the velocity and pressure drop of the mixture using correlations for single phase flow with a modified viscosity and density {{to account for the}} presence of the other phase, but no consideration is made about the relative velocity between the phases. However, the pressure difference, the measuring variable in these flow meters, is known to be affected by the relative velocity between phases, which be-comes more and more important when the flow mixture acceler-ates. This paper addresses this issue and aims to demonstrate the importance of using models which consider the relative velocity between phases in the calculation of the flow within a venturi me-ter. For this purpose, pressure-difference values obtained using the two-fluid model based on an Eulerian- Eulerian approach for the multiphase flow are compared with the results of the homo-geneous model and with experimental data. Both theoretical cal-culations are performed using the CFX 4. 4 package, code which solves multidimensional multiphase flows. Considerations about the two-fluid model are presented, focusing, on the effects of the stress tensor in the dispersed phase. Considerations regarding the two-dimensional nature of the flow are also made.
