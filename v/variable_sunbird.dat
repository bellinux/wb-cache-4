50|$|The <b>variable</b> <b>sunbird</b> is {{a fairly}} common {{resident}} breeder in equatorial Africa. Two eggs are laid in a suspended nest in a tree. This species is found in open woodland and cultivation.|$|E
50|$|Specials: Anchieta's tchagra, moustached grass-warbler, red-winged warbler, black-winged bishop, red-faced crimsonwing, lesser seedcracker, singing cisticola, twinspot indigobird which parasitizes the red-throated twinspot, scarce swift, pallid honeyguide, green-backed woodpecker, stripe-cheeked greenbul, yellow-streaked greenbul, silvery-cheeked hornbill, white-eared barbet, pale batis, black-throated wattle-eye, <b>variable</b> <b>sunbird,</b> bronzy sunbird, olive sunbird, yellow-bellied waxbill, grey waxbill, blue-spotted wood-dove, black-fronted bush-shrike.|$|E
50|$|The <b>variable</b> <b>sunbird</b> (or yellow-bellied sunbird), Cinnyris venustus (formerly Nectarinia venusta), is a sunbird. The {{sunbirds}} are a {{group of}} small Old World passerine birds which feed largely on nectar, although they will also take insects, especially when feeding young. Flight is fast and direct on their short wings. Most species can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but usually perch to feed most of the time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>sunbirds</b> are small, only 10 cm long. They have medium-length thin down-curved {{bills and}} brush-tipped tubular tongues, both adaptations to their nectar feeding.|$|R
50|$|The {{moulting}} {{regimes of}} sunbirds are complex, being different in different species. Many species have no eclipse plumage, but do have juvenile plumage. Some species do show duller plumage in the off-season. In the dry months of June−August, male copper <b>sunbirds</b> and <b>variable</b> <b>sunbirds</b> lose {{much of their}} metallic sheen. In some instances different populations {{of the same species}} can display variation in different molting regimes.|$|R
40|$|Birds show {{considerable}} {{variation in}} sperm morphology. Closely related species and subspecies can show diagnostic differences in sperm size. There is also variation in sperm size among males within a population, and recent evidence from passerine birds {{suggests that the}} coefficient of inter-male variation in sperm length is negatively associated {{with the level of}} sperm competition. Here we examined patterns of inter- and intra-specific variation in sperm length in 12 species of sunbird (Nectariniidae) from Nigeria and Cameroon, a group for which such information is extremely limited. We found significant variation among species in sperm total length, with mean values ranging from 74 μm to 116 μm, placing these species within the short to medium sperm length range for passerine birds. Most of this variation was explained by the length of the midpiece, which contains the fused mitochondria and is an important structure for sperm energetics. Relative midpiece length was negatively correlated with the coefficient of inter-male variation in sperm total length across species, suggesting that sperm competition may have selected for greater midpiece length in this group. We also mapped sperm lengths onto a time-calibrated phylogeny and found support for a phylogenetic signal in all sperm length components, except head length. A test of various evolutionary or tree transformation models gave strongest support for the Brownian motion model for all sperm components, i. e. divergences were best predicted by the phylogenetic distance between lineages. The coefficients of inter-male variation in sperm total length indicate that sperm competition is high but <b>variable</b> among <b>sunbird</b> species, {{as is the case with}} passerine birds at large.

50|$|The regal sunbird {{is a small}} species. The {{adult male}} has head and upper parts an {{iridescent}} golden-green, dark wings and tail and a boldly-marked red and yellow breast and belly. The adult female has dull olive upper parts, with yellowish, faintly streaked underparts. The male is distinctive, but the female could {{be confused with the}} female Rockefeller's sunbird (Cinnyris rockefelleri), though this has a paler throat. The female Ruwenzori double-collared sunbird (Cinnyris stuhlmanni) and the female northern double-collared sunbird (Cinnyris reichenowi) are also similar, but these have greener upper parts and yellower underparts; another similar species is the <b>variable</b> <b>sunbird</b> (Cinnyris venustus), but the regal can be recognised by the upper parts being more olive and the underparts a more uniform yellowish-olive.|$|E
