40|$|The {{interaction}} of a spacially varying electric field and a flowing thin liquid film is investigated experimentally {{for the design}} of a proposed light weight space radiator. Electrodes are utilized to create a negative pressure {{at the bottom of a}} fluid film and suppress leaks if a micrometeorite punctures the radiator surface. Experimental pressure profiles under a vertical falling film, which passes under a finite electrode, show that fields of sufficient strength can be used safely in such a device. Leak stopping experiments demonstrate that leaks can be stopped with an electric field in earth gravity. A new type of electrohydrodynamic instability causes waves in the fluid film to develop into 3 D cones and touch the electrode at a critical voltage. Methods previously used to calculate critical voltages for non moving films are shown to be inappropriate for this situation.

40|$|Dielectrophoresis {{is defined}} as the motion of an {{electrically}} polarisable particle in a non-uniform electric field. Current dielectrophoretic devices enabling sorting of cells are mostly controlled in open-loop applying a predefined <b>voltage</b> <b>on</b> micro-electrodes. Closed-loop control of these devices would enable to get advanced functionalities and also more robust behavior. Currently, the numerical models of dielectrophoretic force are too complex to be used in real-time closed-loop control.

We propose an analytical model of the electric field based on Fourier series to compute the dielectrophoretic force produced by parallel electrode arrays. Indeed, this method provides an analytical expression of the electric potential which decouples the geometrical factors (parameter of our system), the <b>voltages</b> applied <b>on</b> <b>electrodes</b> (input of our system), and the position of the cells (output of our system).

This dynamic model of our system is required to design the future closed-loop control law. The predicted dielectrophoretic forces are compared to a numerical simulation based on finite element model using COMSOL software.

40|$|Abstract—The I–V {{characteristics}} of a room-temperature atmospheric pressure air plasma are investigated. The plasma is driven by a homemade direct-current power supply. However, dis-charge currents appear pulsed. The pulse behavior {{is determined by the}} ion drift mechanism. The effects of the applied voltage and the gap distance d on pulsed repetition frequency f and peak value Ipeak of the current pulse are studied in detail. It is found that the applied voltage dramatically affects Ipeak but not the pulse repetition frequency f. When the applied voltage is higher than 12 kV, the <b>voltage</b> <b>on</b> the <b>electrode</b> just before breakdown starts to decrease with the increase in the applied voltage. A detail analysis shows that the residual charges {{play an important role in}} the initiation of breakdown under this condition. On the other hand, when the applied voltage is lower than 12 kV, the <b>voltage</b> <b>on</b> the <b>electrode</b> just before breakdown keeps constant for various applied voltages; it indicates that the residual charges play a minor role in the initiation of breakdown for this circumstance.

The pulse repetition frequency is inversely proportional to the gap distance, which is exactly observed in the experiments.
