5|$|Early in its life, Debby was {{forecast}} to {{pass through}} the southern Cape Verde islands as a tropical storm, potentially causing life-threatening flooding. Most computer models consistently predicted Debby to track to the northwest throughout its lifetime, though intensity was more problematic for forecasters. The National Hurricane Center continually predicted Debby to intensify to hurricane status, though strong <b>vertical</b> <b>shear</b> ultimately prevented the storm from becoming a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear, {{sometimes}} referred to as windshear or wind gradient, is a difference in wind speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the Earth's atmosphere. Wind shear can be broken down into vertical and horizontal components, with horizontal wind shear seen across weather fronts and near the coast, and <b>vertical</b> <b>shear</b> typically near the surface, though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Edouard quickly strengthened {{due to the}} establishment of an upper-level anticyclone over the storm. The storm moved to the west in response to a strong subtropical ridge to its north, and Edouard strengthened into a hurricane on August 23. Due to very favorable conditions, the hurricane rapidly strengthened on August 24 and August 25 to peak as a 145mph (230km/h) Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed for a motion more to the west-northwest, and the hurricane passed about 250mi (400km) north of the Lesser Antilles on August 28. For three days during this time, Edouard maintained Category4 intensity, though weakened late on August 28 due to an eyewall replacement cycle and <b>vertical</b> <b>shear.</b>|$|E

Impacts of ocean heat content (OHC) and <b>vertical</b> wind <b>shear</b> on intensity changes of Typhoon Sinlaku and Typhoon Jangmi during the Tropical Cyclone Structure- 2008 and THORPEX Pacific Asian Regional Campaign are investigated. Observations of ocean structure variables were {{obtained in the}} environment of each typhoon via aircraft-deployed expendable bathythermographs (AXBTs). Strong correspondence among storm intensity changes, ocean features, and <b>vertical</b> wind <b>shear</b> is identified as each tropical cyclone passed over regions of warm and cold ocean features with varying <b>vertical</b> wind <b>shears.</b> Typhoon Sinlaku passed over a cold ocean and with a consistently low <b>vertical</b> wind <b>shear,</b> the storm did not intensify for 12 hours.

40|$|A {{decomposition}} of meridional overturning circulation (MOC) cells into geostrophic <b>vertical</b> <b>shears,</b> Ekman, and bottom pressure–dependent (or external mode) circulation components is presented. The decomposition requires the following information: 1) a density profile wherever bathymetry changes {{to construct the}} <b>vertical</b> <b>shears</b> component, 2) the zonal-mean zonal wind stress for the Ekman component, and 3) the mean depth-independent velocity information over each isobath to construct the external mode. The decomposition {{is applied to the}} third-generation Hadley Centre Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere General Circulation Model (HadCM 3) to determine the meridional variability of these individual components within the Atlantic Ocean. The external mode component is shown to be extremely important where western boundary currents impinge on topography, and also {{in the area of the}} overflows. The Sverdrup balance explains the shape of the external mode MOC component to first order, but the time variability of the external mode exhibits only a very weak dependence on the wind stress curl. Thus, the Sverdrup balance cannot be used to determine the external mode changes when examining temporal change in the MOC. The <b>vertical</b> <b>shears</b> component allows the time-mean and the time-variable upper North Atlantic MOC cell to be deduced at 25 °S and 50 °N. A stronger dependency on the external mode and Ekman components between 8 ° and 35 °N and in the regions of the overflows means that hydrographic sections need to be supplemented by bottom pressure and wind stress information at these latitudes. At the decadal time scale, variability in Ekman transport is less important than that in geostrophic shears. In the Southern Hemisphere the <b>vertical</b> <b>shears</b> component is dominant at all time scales, suggesting that hydrographic sections alone may be suitable for deducing change in the MOC at these latitudes. 1.

5|$|Alex {{turned to}} the east-northeast after passing the Outer Banks in {{response}} to becoming embedded within the west-southwesterly flow. The hurricane briefly weakened to a Category1, but restrengthened due to warm waters of the Gulf Stream. Water temperatures remained 3.6 °F (2 °C) above normal, resulting in Alex intensifying into a 120mph (195km/h) major hurricane on August 5 while located 450miles (710km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Due to low <b>vertical</b> <b>shear</b> and favorable conditions, Alex remained a Category3 hurricane until passing over cooler waters late on the 5th while 290miles (465km) south of Newfoundland. Alex rapidly weakened, degrading into tropical storm status on August 6. Later on the 6th, Alex became extratropical while 950miles (1530km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland, and lost its identity shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong southwesterly <b>vertical</b> <b>shear,</b> Henri {{continued}} intensifying while moving eastward, {{and reached}} a peak strength of 60mph (95km/h) later on September 5. Shortly thereafter, though, the shear greatly weakened the storm, {{and it was}} downgraded to a tropical depression. Henri {{was not able to}} recover its intensity, and made landfall near Clearwater, Florida on September 6 as a 35mph (55km/h) tropical depression, and quickly crossed the state as it accelerated to the northeast. Despite initial predictions of re-intensification over open waters due to potentially lower shear, Henri failed to re-strengthen and degenerated into a remnant low pressure area on September 8 off the coast of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kate {{maintained}} hurricane {{status for}} twelve hours before decelerating {{to the north}} and weakening to a tropical storm. The storm then turned sharply west-southwestward while moving around the eastern side of a mid-level circulation. Passing over progressively warmer waters and into an area with decreasing <b>vertical</b> <b>shear,</b> Kate regained hurricane status on October 1. Guided by an anticyclone to its north and a cyclonic circulation to its south, the hurricane continued west-southwestward over the subtropical waters of 30°N, and presented a well-defined eye on October 2.

5|$|On August 25, a {{tropical}} wave emerged {{off the coast}} of Africa. Tracking westward, the wave developed convection over its center, and conducive conditions allowed it to develop further. The system passed through the Cape Verde islands later that day as convection steadily weakened. Early on August 27, convection again increased and consolidated near the center, and later that day the wave developed into Tropical Depression Ten while located 420miles (675km) west of the Cape Verde islands. Moving westward into an area of warm waters and low <b>vertical</b> <b>shear,</b> the depression steadily intensified, and was named Tropical Storm Fabian on August 28 as convection increased and banding features became more prominent.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Paul was a {{hurricane}} that ultimately struck Mexico as a tropical depression in October 2006. It developed {{from an area}} of disturbed weather on October21, and slowly intensified as it moved into an area of warm waters and progressively decreasing wind shear. Paul attained hurricane status on October23, and later that day it reached its peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h), a strong Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. A strong trough turned the hurricane {{to the north and}} northeast into an area of strong <b>vertical</b> <b>shear,</b> and Paul weakened to a tropical storm on October24. It accelerated northeastward, and after passing a short distance south of Baja California Sur the low level circulation became decoupled {{from the rest of the}} convection. Paul weakened to a tropical depression on October25 a short distance off the coast of Mexico, and after briefly turning away from the coast it made landfall on northwestern Sinaloa on October26.|$|E
5|$|In {{east central}} Florida, a warm sector, {{a region of}} warm surface air between a cold front and a warm front, was {{positioned}} ahead of a progressing cold front.

Instability increased overnight with temperatures and dew points increasing through the pre-dawn hours. For example, northwest of Orlando, temperatures were still at , which was about 3 degrees warmer than the average high for the day and 14 degrees warmer than the average low. The conditions helped to form a long-tracked supercell thunderstorm that traveled from Sumter County to the coastal waters of Volusia County during {{the early morning hours of}} February 2, 2007, producing three tornadoes along its track.|$|E
40|$|While {{tropical}} cyclone rainfall {{has a large}} axisymmetric component, previous observational and theoretical {{studies have shown that}} environmental <b>vertical</b> wind <b>shear</b> leads to an asymmetric component of the vertical motion and precipitation fields. Composites consistently depict a precipitation enhancement downshear and also cyclonically downwind from the downshear direction. For consistence with much of the literature and with Northern Hemisphere observations, this is subsequently referred to as "Downshear-Left". Stronger shear magnitudes are associated with greater amplitude precipitation asymmetries. Recent work has reinforced the prior findings, and explored details of the response of the precipitation and kinematic fields to environmental <b>vertical</b> wind <b>shear.</b> Much of this research has focused on {{tropical cyclone}}s away from land, to limit the influence of other processes that might distort the signal related to <b>vertical</b> wind <b>shear.</b> Recent evidence does suggest <b>vertical</b> wind <b>shear</b> can also {{play a major role in}} precipitation asymmetries during and after landfall...|$|R

5|$|Initially, Cyclone Glenda was {{forecast}} {{to intensify}} further. However, a gradual increase in <b>vertical</b> <b>shear</b> caused {{the eye to}} become disorganised, with land interaction contributing to further weakening. The BoM maintained Glenda as a Category5 cyclone until 29 March, and initially it was forecast to turn southward to move ashore near the populated region of Karratha at high tide. It retained its south west track and passed over several weather stations, one of which recorded sustained winds of 176km/h (109mph). Glenda made landfall near the less populated town of Onslow at around 10pm WST (1400UTC) on 30 March. The cyclone had weakened to a marginal Category 3 {{at the time of}} landfall. The JTWC issued its final warning on Glenda shortly after it moved ashore. The cyclone turned south and south-south-eastward and rapidly weakened over land in an area of increasing wind shear, and early on 31 March the BoM downgraded Glenda to a tropical low.|$|E
5|$|Intermittent deep {{convection}} {{continued to}} fire up, keeping the storm afloat {{for the next}} day and turning it away from the Azores. Danielle also changed direction and meandered slightly to the northwest, away from the Azores, due to very weak steering currents. After holding on as a minimal tropical storm, Danielle finally lost its deep convection due to high upper-level <b>vertical</b> <b>shear</b> and was downgraded to a tropical depression on the afternoon of August 20. The depression turned once again to the north, and continued to lose organization over cooler water. It degenerated into a remnant low on the afternoon of August 21 as the convection was completely sheared away from the center of Danielle. The remnant low remained in the open ocean, remaining devoid of any deep convection, until August 24 when it dissipated west-southwest of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|A {{vigorous}} upper-level low developed west of Alberto on August 7 and August 8. This {{caused an}} increase in <b>vertical</b> <b>shear,</b> weakening the hurricane down to a tropical storm on August 9. The low also caused the storm {{to turn to the}} northwest. However, on August 10, Alberto became better organised and was upgraded to hurricane status again. It then moved in a gradual curve towards the north and northeast through a break in a subtropical ridge between August 11 and August 12. Alberto made its closest approach to Bermuda on August 11, passing about 345mi (555km) east of the island. The strong storm became a Category3 major hurricane on August 12 and reached its second and highest peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), and a 60mi (95km) wide eye was observed. Alberto was an unusual storm in that it reached its peak intensity at a high latitude, north of 35˚N, after it had re-curved. The hurricane began to weaken due to increasing upper-level westerlies on August 13 and August 14, while moving east-northeastward. Alberto was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 14.|$|E

5|$|After {{maintaining}} {{peak strength}} for about 18hours, Kenneth began a sharp weakening trend due to unfavorable north-northeasterly wind shear; this {{was caused by}} the anticyclone over Hurricane Jova, which eroded the eyewall of Hurricane Kenneth. While weakening, the hurricane turned to a southwest drift, due to a weakness in steering currents. By September 20, its deepest convection was confined to the southern half of the hurricane, and later in the day Kenneth weakened to tropical storm status. Reduced moisture in the atmosphere weakened the system further, and by September 21 its circulation was exposed to the east-northeast of the convection. Kenneth began a steady west-northwest track due to a weak ridge to its north. Operationally the storm was predicted to continue weakening and dissipate within four days. However, deep convection re-developed near the center as the outflow became better defined, and Kenneth remained a moderate tropical storm for several days. On September 24, the motion became nearly stationary as steering currents again weakened. <b>Vertical</b> <b>shear</b> sharply declined, allowing the convection to become more symmetrical and for an eye feature to develop. On September 25, Kenneth again attained hurricane status while located about 1085miles (1745km) east-southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Due to low {{amounts of}} <b>vertical</b> <b>shear,</b> very warm waters, and {{abundant}} moisture, steady intensification was forecast, and the depression strengthened to Tropical Storm John later on August 28. Deep convection continued to develop over the storm, while an eye feature developed within the expanding central dense overcast. The storm continued to intensify, and John attained hurricane status on August 29 while 190miles (305km) south-southeast of Acapulco. Banding features {{continued to increase}} as the hurricane moved west-northwestward around the southwest periphery of a mid- to upper-level ridge over northern Mexico. The hurricane underwent rapid intensification, and John attained major hurricane status 12hours after becoming a hurricane. Shortly thereafter, the eye became obscured, and the intensity remained at 115mph (185km/h) due to an eyewall replacement cycle. Another eye formed, and based on Reconnaissance data, the hurricane attained Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on August 30 about 160miles (260km) west of Acapulco, or 95miles (155km) south of Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán. Hours later, the hurricane underwent another eyewall replacement cycle, and subsequently weakened to Category3 status as it paralleled the Mexican coastline a short distance offshore.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 3, {{strong wind}} shear over Chris {{detached}} the deep convection {{from the low}} level circulation, while a building ridge to its north turned the storm towards the west into an area of drier air. By mid-day on the 3rd the circulation was devoid of any convection within 85miles (135km), while the deeper convection spread across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. Late on August 3, deep convection developed over the center of circulation again, though persistent <b>vertical</b> <b>shear</b> weakened Chris to a tropical depression on August 4. Due to computer models predicting lesser amounts of shear, forecasters indicated the possibility of moderate strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico to a 60mph (95km/h) storm. However, convection remained minimal, and Chris degenerated into a remnant {{area of low pressure}} late on August 4. Late on August 5, convection increased in the remnants of the storm, and forecasters indicated the potential for slow development over the Gulf of Mexico due to marginally favorable conditions. Redevelopment never occurred, and the remnant circulation dissipated near Havana, Cuba on August 6.|$|E
50|$|By December 28, the JTWC began {{tracking}} the system, {{as it began}} to make {{a significant increase in}} deep convection, with formative convective banding developing around the system.

5|$|Located to {{the south}} of a mid-level ridge, the {{depression}} moved to the west-northwest. With weak to moderate upper-level wind shear over the system, the depression gradually organized, and intensified into Tropical Storm Erin on September 2. Though Erin had favorable upper-level outflow and developing convection, the inner core of the storm remained disorganized. The storm slowly strengthened, and attained an initial peak intensity of 60mph (95km/h) while located about 1,150miles (1,855km) east of the Lesser Antilles. Favorable conditions were expected to allow Erin to continue to strengthen to reach winds of 85mph (135km/h). However, an upper-level low to the northwest of Erin produced strong <b>vertical</b> <b>shear</b> over the storm, and Erin quickly weakened as the low-level circulation became exposed {{to the south}}west of the deep convection. The shear slightly abated on September 4, allowing Erin to briefly re-strengthen. However, the storm remained disorganized, and following an increase in southwesterly wind shear Erin began a weakening trend. On September 5, Erin weakened to a tropical depression, and hours later the low-level circulation dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Located {{within an}} area of {{moderate}} southwesterly wind shear, the depression was slow to organize; early on October 14, a clear center was not depicted on Infrared satellite imagery. The depression moved to the west-northwest and gradually strengthened into Tropical Storm Nicholas late on October 14 while located 1,200miles (1,930km) east of the Windward Islands. On October 15, deep convection became much better organized, though the center of Nicholas remained displaced from the deepest of the shower activity. Despite the shear, the storm continued to strengthen as it moved to the west-northwest, a motion caused by a mid-level ridge to its north. On October 16, Nicholas transitioned from a sheared, unorganized system to a more organized system, {{as a result of}} banding features and improvement in its convective pattern due to lesser amounts of <b>vertical</b> <b>shear</b> and a healthier anticyclone over the storm. Nicholas continued to strengthen, and attained a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) on October 17 while located 875miles (1,410km) east of the Leeward Islands. Dvorak estimates suggested Nicholas potentially attained hurricane status, though microwave images of the storm showed a sheared system without any evidence of an eye feature.|$|E
5|$|The {{most intense}} {{hurricane}} {{of the season}} began as a tropical wave that organized into a tropical depression southeast of Cabo Verde early on September8. Initial organization was fast-paced, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Igor six hours after formation. Igor moved west to west-northwest for several days while embedded within the monsoon trough. Increased <b>vertical</b> <b>shear</b> caused the cyclone to temporarily weaken to a tropical depression by 12:00UTC on September9, but it re-attained tropical storm intensity {{the next day and}} further strengthened to a hurricane by 00:00UTC on September12. After rapid intensification and a subsequent eyewall replacement cycle, Igor attained its peak with maximum sustained winds of 155mph (250km/h) by 00:00UTC on September15. Inner core changes continued after peak, and Igor continued as a Category4 hurricane for several days until increased shear and dry air entrainment forced a consistent weakening trend early on September17. The system recurved north-northeast while passing within 60mi (95km) of Bermuda as a minimal hurricane. It eventually made landfall near Cape Race, Newfoundland with winds of 85mph (140km/h) by 15:00UTC on September21 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone three hours later. The extratropical low was absorbed by a larger such system between Greenland and Labrador on September23.|$|E
