5|$|At the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, {{cities in}} the {{highlands}} and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation {{in the production of}} stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E
5|$|In Orson Welles's {{film version}} of Macbeth (1948), Fleance is briefly seen again at the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movie. He does not speak in this scene, but he has {{returned}} to Scotland with the army of Malcolm and Macduff, and is shown along with those hailing Malcolm as the new king after the killing of Macbeth.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. At the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing {{to one of the}} two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop.|$|E

50|$|Bryant Playground is a 3.1 acre (13,000 m²) {{playground}} and park located in Seattle, United States, at N.E. 65th Street and 40th Avenue N.E.

5|$|The {{earliest}} ceramic evidence excavated at Buena Vista {{dates to}} the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Early Preclassic period, indicating that the site was initially settled at the transition between the Early and Middle Preclassic periods. The long occupational history of Buena Vista {{may be linked to}} its proximity to chert-rich hills. Excavations have revealed evidence of chert workshops dedicated to the production of tools, together with dumps of waste flakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{swell of}} the muzzle {{refers to the}} slight swell in the {{diameter}} of the piece at the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chase. It is often chamfered on the inside to make loading the cannon easier. In some guns, this element is replaced with a wide ring and is called a muzzle band.|$|E
5|$|All {{specimens}} of Majungasaurus {{have been recovered}} from the Maevarano Formation in the Mahajanga Province in northwestern Madagascar. Most of these, including all of the most complete material, came from the Anembalemba Member, although Majungasaurus teeth have also {{been found in the}} underlying Masorobe Member and the overlying Miadana Member. While these sediments have not been dated radiometrically, evidence from biostratigraphy and paleomagnetism suggest that they were deposited during the Maastrichtian stage, which lasted from 70 to 66 Ma (million years ago). Majungasaurus teeth are found up until the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maastrichtian, when all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct.|$|E

5|$|Four large mosaic {{panels are}} {{installed}} on either {{ends of the}} station hall and the two escalator tunnels. On the side {{that leads to the}} exit to the city, a panel was installed depicting the patron saint of Kiev, Michael the Archangel. Meanwhile, at the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station, Saint George is depicted, symbolizing Moscow, the Soviet Union's capital at the time. One of the mosaic panels {{at the end of the}} station near the escalators includes an inscription featuring a Ukrainian nationalist slogan, stating СЛАВА УКРАЇНІ, which is translated as Glory to Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|Much of our {{evidence}} for 4th century army unit deployments {{is contained in}} a single document, the Notitia Dignitatum, compiled c. 395–420, a manual of all late Roman public offices, military and civil. The main deficiency with the Notitia is that it lacks any personnel figures so as to render estimates of army size impossible. Also, it was compiled at the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4th century; it is thus difficult to reconstruct the position earlier. However, the Notitia remains the central source on the late Army's structure due to the dearth of other evidence. The Notitia also suffers from significant lacunae and numerous errors accumulated from centuries of copying.|$|E
5|$|The {{emotional}} {{distance of}} the characters and the intellectual and artificial-seeming, quasi-theatrical dialogue is deliberate, depicting their simultaneous connection and isolation. The chasm between Marie and Julien, due to his corporeality and her ghostly nature, is emphasised in the contrast between his physical activity and her status as an onlooker. Rivette says he wanted the lovers to appear ill-suited and for the viewer to question the relationship; they love each other passionately yet they are essentially strangers. Béart believes that Marie was more alive than Julien, and that he literally wakes up to her existence only at the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E

Other, more sophisticated methods are available, but {{often it is}} not necessary to use these as it only affects <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transformed signal.

Since <b>the</b> sites <b>of</b> {{integration into}} <b>the</b> target DNA are relatively non-specific, {{it is thought}} that this domain may work together in some fashion with the target DNA. Information retrieved from experiments with chimeric integrases show that recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target site is controlled by the core domain. Cross-linking studies also suggest that the C-terminal domain works together with a subterminal region just inside <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viral DNA.|$|R

5|$|The {{function}} of the Maya stela was central to the ideology of Maya kingship {{from the very beginning}} of the Classic Period through to the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Terminal Classic (800–900). The hieroglyphic inscriptions on the stelae of the Classic period site of Piedras Negras played a key part in the decipherment of the script, with stelae being grouped around seven different structures and each group appearing to chart the life of a particular individual, with key dates being celebrated, such as birth, marriage and military victories. From these stelae, epigrapher Tatiana Proskouriakoff was able to identify that they contained details of royal rulers and their associates, rather than priests and gods as had previously been theorised.|$|E
5|$|The most elite, veteran Antigonid-period Macedonian {{infantry}} from {{at least}} the time of Antigonus III Doson were the peltasts, lighter and more maneuverable soldiers wielding peltai javelins, swords, and a smaller bronze shield than Macedonian phalanx pikemen, although they sometimes served in that capacity. Among the peltasts, roughly 2,000 men were selected {{to serve in the}} elite agema vanguard, with other peltasts numbering roughly 3,000. The amount of peltasts varied over time, perhaps never more than 5,000 men (the largest figure mentioned by ancient historians, an amount that existed in the Social War of 219 BC). They fought alongside the phalanx pikemen, divided now into chalkaspides 'bronze shield' and leukaspides 'white shield' regiments, up until the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kingdom in 168 BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{signing of}} former Phillies closer Billy Wagner by the Mets between the 2005 and 2006 seasons {{was a factor}} in the {{intensification}} of the rivalry. Pat Burrell and Wagner became embroiled in heated media discussions after Wagner departed the Phillies. For the first time in 2006, both franchises fielded contenders until deep into the season. The Mets steadily led the NL East (finally supplanting the decade-long division champions, the Atlanta Braves), while the Phillies maintained pace as a wild card contender until the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season. The Mets won the head-to-head season matchup, beating the Phillies 11 out of 18 times. The Mets won the division, but lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2006 National League Championship Series.|$|E

5|$|Unas' most {{immediate}} legacy is his funerary cult, which continued {{at least until}} the end of the Old Kingdom. This cult is attested by the tombs at Saqqara of seven priests responsible for the religious duties to be performed in the funerary complex. Three of these tombs date to the early Sixth Dynasty in the time following the death of Pepi I. Three more tombs date to the reign of Pepi II and the last one dates to the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Kingdom (c. 2180 BC). The priests of the cult of Unas adopted basilophorous names, incorporating that of the king, possibly upon taking office.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the old {{characters}} in the Pokémon franchise, Mew's development was not overseen by Ken Sugimori, but by Game Freak programmer Shigeki Morimoto. Morimoto programmed Mew into the game secretly, as a prank amongst the staff just prior to its release in Japan, intending {{it to be a}} Pokémon only Game Freak staff members would know about and be able to obtain. Mew was added at the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development of Pokémon Red and Blue after the removal of debug features, freeing up just enough space to add the character despite being told not to alter the game any further at this point. Though not intended by the developers to be obtainable, due to a glitch, players were able to encounter it.|$|E

Ray finds Harris, along with his family, and nearly kills him. However, he realizes that Harris was an accountant who accidentally sent the barrel to the salvage yard. Seeing that he was ultimately innocent, Ray spares him and goes off to die. Scully believes that this act represented the last of Ray’s humanity. At the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode, a car is dropped into a compactor at a salvage yard and crushed.

One reviewer said, [...] "Looking past {{the fact that}} the plot is blatant rip-off of Fushigi Yûgi, Haruka is so poorly written as to be almost incomprehensible to anyone who hasn’t played the game." [...] Another stated that [...] "The <b>very</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last volume, and thereby the series as a whole, suffers from a lack of explanation", but did offer praise for the art, saying [...] "Mizuno's drawings really are a pleasure to look at." ...|$|R
