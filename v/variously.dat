5|$|Ununennium is {{predicted}} to have a melting point between 0°C and 30°C: thus {{it may be a}} liquid at room temperature. It is not known whether this continues the trend of decreasing melting points down the group, as francium's melting point is known so poorly, having been <b>variously</b> been stated to be around 23°C or 27°C, with both values very close to the caesium value (28.5°C), possibly due to the extreme heat generated by francium's radioactive decay. The boiling point of ununennium is expected to be around 630°C, which is lower than that of all the previous elements in the group, following the downward periodic trend. The density of ununennium has been <b>variously</b> predicted to be between 3 and 4g·cm−3, continuing the trend of increasing density down the group, using the predicted value for francium between 2.8 and 3.0g·cm−3.|$|E

5|$|Ancient writers {{believed}} that the worship of Terminus had been introduced to Rome {{during the reign of}} the first king Romulus (traditionally 753717 BC) or his successor Numa (717673 BC).

5|$|Artists in {{the eighteenth}} century (e.g., Henry Fuseli, William Rimmer) {{depicted}} the witches <b>variously,</b> as have many directors since.

Some film adaptations have cast the witches as such modern analogues as hippies on drugs, or goth schoolgirls. Their influence reaches the literary realm as well in such works as the Discworld and Harry Potter series.|$|E
