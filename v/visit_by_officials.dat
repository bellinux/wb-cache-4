50|$|The Institution went {{unchecked}} until 1958 - when it {{was closed}} down - after the inmates staged a “riot” amid claims of abuse and ill treatment. The girls were all aged between 15 and 19 {{years of age and}} none had been convicted of a criminal offence. Despite this police all over the city were hunting for them and newspaper reports called on the public to be vigilant and look out for the girls, distinctive in their blue dresses and white aprons. Each time the girls were rounded up they staged another breakout, some escaping down the fire escape; others staged a rooftop protest. They vowed to keep escaping until their voices were heard. The “riot” lasted for three days. The final breakout occurred during a <b>visit</b> <b>by</b> <b>officials</b> from the Scottish home department who were investigating the series of events. There was an official inquiry into their claims of beatings, bullying and verbal abuse; as of March 2017 no one has been held accountable.|$|E
