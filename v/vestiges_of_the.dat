5|$|After the {{destruction}} by fire of the Palace of Whitehall in 1698, the surroundings of the Privy Garden changed dramatically. Most {{of the palace}} buildings had been burned down in the 1698 fire; others were torn down as the last <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Tudor and Stuart Palace were removed. With {{the demise of the}} Privy Gallery, the Privy Garden was extended north to include the Pebble Court behind the Banqueting House.|$|E

5|$|As the 19th century wore on, workhouses {{increasingly}} became refuges for the elderly, infirm {{and sick}} {{rather than the}} able-bodied poor, and in 1929 legislation was passed to allow local authorities to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals. Although workhouses were formally abolished by the same legislation in 1930, many continued under their new appellation of Public Assistance Institutions {{under the control of}} local authorities. It was not until the National Assistance Act of 1948 that the last <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Poor Law disappeared, and with them the workhouses.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad was {{completed}} between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia in 1854. During the 1880s, the South Pennsylvania Railroad was proposed {{to compete with}} the Pennsylvania. It received the backing of William Henry Vanderbilt, head of the New York Central Railroad (the Pennsylvania's chief rival). Andrew Carnegie also provided financial support, since he was unhappy with rates charged by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Construction began on the rival line in 1883, but stopped when the railroads reached an agreement in 1885. After construction halted, the only <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South Pennsylvania were nine tunnels, some roadbed and piers for a bridge over the Susquehanna River in Harrisburg.|$|E
5|$|Whereas Linnaeus {{classified}} {{for ease}} of identification, {{the idea of the}} Linnaean taxonomy as translating into a sort of dendrogram of the Animal- and Plant Kingdoms was formulated {{toward the end of the}} 18th century, well before On the Origin of Species was published. Among early works exploring the idea of a transmutation of species were Erasmus Darwin's 1796 Zoönomia and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Philosophie Zoologique of 1809. The idea was popularised in the Anglophone world by the speculative but widely read <b>Vestiges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Natural History of Creation, published anonymously by Robert Chambers in 1844.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, the Scottish {{publisher}} Robert Chambers anonymously {{published an}} extremely controversial but widely read book entitled <b>Vestiges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Natural History of Creation. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for {{the origins of}} the Solar System and of life on Earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed a progressive ascent of animals, with current animals branching off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations lead to the unfolding of a preordained plan that had been woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Grant, but its implication that humans were only the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. The high profile of the public debate over Vestiges, with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later.|$|E
5|$|In November 1844, the {{anonymously}} published popular science book <b>Vestiges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Natural History of Creation, {{written by}} Scottish journalist Robert Chambers, widened {{public interest in}} the concept of transmutation of species. Vestiges used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim that living things had progressed from the simple to the more complex over time. But it proposed a linear progression rather than the branching common descent theory behind Darwin's work in progress, and it ignored adaptation. Darwin read it soon after publication, and scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but he carefully reviewed his own arguments after leading scientists, including Adam Sedgwick, attacked its morality and scientific errors. Vestiges had significant influence on public opinion, and the intense debate helped {{to pave the way for}} the acceptance of the more scientifically sophisticated Origin by moving evolutionary speculation into the mainstream. While few naturalists were willing to consider transmutation, Herbert Spencer became an active proponent of Lamarckism and progressive development in the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Knights Hill {{starts in}} the north at West Norwood in the Norwood Triangle one-way system, and runs through a council ward also named as Knight's Hill. It ends in the south at a {{junction}} with the A214 at Crown Lane and Crown Dale. Knights Hill becomes Beulah Hill here at Crown Point. To the north, south of Knight's Hill {{is the part of}} the Crystal Palace area with no name home to a large parade of competing large super markets along the A215 Norwood Road including Tesco, Cooperative, Iceland and (by Summer 2009) Sainsbury (ex Woolworth's site). West Norwood railway station is on this road. Knights Hill contains the Knights Hill Nature Reserve, one of the last remaining <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great North Wood which once covered the area.|$|E

5|$|Romantic {{thinking}} was {{also evident in}} the writings of Hugh Miller, stonemason and geologist, who followed in the tradition of Naturphilosophie, arguing that nature was a pre-ordained progression towards the human race. Publisher, historian, antiquarian and scientist Robert Chambers (1802–71) became a friend of Scott, writing a biography of him after the author's death. Chambers also became a geologist, researching in Scandinavia and Canada. His most influential work was the anonymously published <b>Vestiges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Natural History of Creation (1844), which was the most comprehensive written argument in favour of evolution before the work of Charles Darwin (1809–82). His work was strongly influenced by transcendental anatomy, which, drawing on Goethe and Lorenz Oken (1779–1851), looked for ideal patterns and structure in nature and had been pioneered in Scotland by figures including Robert Knox (1791–1862).|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} ripe for {{redevelopment}} by the landholding elite, {{who wished to}} have suitably grand townhouses to occupy while attending Parliament and the court. The <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Privy Garden became {{the site of a}} new street. In 1808 a row of houses called Whitehall Gardens was constructed on the site. Behind each house, long grassy gardens planted with rows of trees led directly down to the river, until they were cut off by the construction of the Victoria Embankment along the river bank between 1865 and 1870. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli lived in one of the houses between 1873 and 1875, while Sir Robert Peel lived in another (and died there in 1850 after falling from his horse on Constitution Hill). The trees outside the front entrance to Whitehall Gardens were the last survivors of the original Privy Garden, and stood until as recently as the late 1930s.|$|E
5|$|While various {{religions}} and denominations have reconciled their beliefs with evolution through {{concepts such as}} theistic evolution, there are creationists who believe that evolution is contradicted by the creation myths found in their {{religions and}} who raise various objections to evolution. As had been demonstrated by responses to the publication of <b>Vestiges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Natural History of Creation in 1844, the most controversial aspect of evolutionary biology is the implication of human evolution that humans share common ancestry with apes and that the mental and moral faculties of humanity have {{the same types of}} natural causes as other inherited traits in animals. In some countries, notably the United States, these tensions between science and religion have fuelled the current creation–evolution controversy, a religious conflict focusing on politics and public education. While other scientific fields such as cosmology and Earth science also conflict with literal interpretations of many religious texts, evolutionary biology experiences significantly more opposition from religious literalists.|$|E
25|$|Montaigne's Tower is <b>the</b> {{southern}} tower <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Château de Montaigne, {{a historical}} monument located in <b>the</b> French département <b>of</b> Dordogne. <b>The</b> tower is <b>the</b> only <b>vestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original sixteenth-century castle, since the other buildings {{had to be}} rebuilt following a fire in 1885.|$|R

5|$|Jean Baptiste Lamarck used fossils in his {{arguments}} for {{his theory of}} the transmutation of species in the early 19th century. Fossil finds, and the emerging evidence that life had changed over time, fueled speculation on this topic {{during the next few}} decades. Robert Chambers used fossil evidence in his 1844 popular science book <b>Vestiges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Natural History of Creation, which advocated an evolutionary origin for the cosmos as well as for life on earth. Like Lamarck's theory it maintained that life had progressed from the simple to the complex. These early evolutionary ideas were widely discussed in scientific circles but were not accepted into the scientific mainstream. Many of the critics of transmutational ideas used fossil evidence in their arguments. In the same paper that coined the term dinosaur Richard Owen pointed out that dinosaurs were at least as sophisticated and complex as modern reptiles, which he claimed contradicted transmutational theories. Hugh Miller would make a similar argument, pointing out that the fossil fish found in the Old Red Sandstone formation were fully as complex as any later fish, and not the primitive forms alleged by Vestiges. While these early evolutionary theories failed to become accepted as mainstream science, the debates over them would help pave the way for the acceptance of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection a few years later.|$|E
5|$|The Han {{system of}} {{imperial}} government borrowed {{many of its}} core features from the regime established by the Qin dynasty. For example, Gaozu's Chancellor Xiao He (d. 193 BC) integrated much of the statutes of the Qin law code into the newly compiled Han law code. Yet Gaozu's establishment of central control over {{only a third of}} the empire—the other two-thirds of territory was controlled by semi-autonomous kingdoms—strayed from Qin's imperial model which gave the emperor direct control over all of China. However, a series of reforms eventually stripped away any <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kingdoms' independence. Han emperors thereafter enjoyed full and direct control over China, as had the first Qin emperor. The Han court's gradual move towards reestablishing central control can also be seen in its monetary policy. While the Qin regime installed a nationwide standard currency, the early Western Han regime oscillated between abolishing and legalizing private mints, commandery-level mints, and kingdom-level mints issuing various coins. In 113 BC the Han court finally established the central government's monopoly control over the issuance of a standard, nationwide currency.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the crisis between 1290 and 1348 and the {{subsequent}} epidemics produced many challenges for the English economy. In the decades after the disaster, {{the economic and social}} issues arising from the Black Death combined with the costs of the Hundred Years War to produce the Peasants Revolt of 1381. Although the revolt was suppressed, it undermined many of the <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feudal economic order, and the countryside became dominated by estates organised as farms, frequently owned or rented by the new economic class of the gentry. The English agricultural economy remained depressed throughout the 15th century; growth at this time came from the greatly increased English cloth trade and manufacturing. The economic consequences of this varied considerably from region to region, but generally London, the South and the West prospered {{at the expense of the}} Eastern and the older cities. The role of merchants and trade became increasingly seen as important to the country, and usury gradually became more widely accepted, with English economic thinking increasingly influenced by Renaissance humanist theories.|$|E
50|$|As the spiritualism {{movement}} {{began to}} fade, partly through <b>the</b> publicity <b>of</b> fraud accusations and partly through <b>the</b> appeal <b>of</b> religious movements such as Christian science, the Spiritualist Church was organised. This church can {{claim to be}} <b>the</b> main <b>vestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movement left today in the United States.|$|R
25|$|On {{the home}} front, {{mobilization}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. economy was managed by Roosevelt's War Production Board. The wartime production boom led to full employment, wiping out this <b>vestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression. Indeed, labor shortages encouraged industry {{to look for}} new sources of workers, finding new roles for women and blacks.|$|R
25|$|Regrettably, in 1801 the Ménagerie, {{which had}} been sold during <b>the</b> sales <b>of</b> land that {{occurred}} after the Revolution, was destroyed. Today, the Pavilion de la Lanterne, <b>the</b> only surviving <b>vestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ménagerie, is being restored providing us with a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cynegetic decoration <b>of</b> this lost Versailles masterpiece.|$|R
5|$|The screenplay, {{written by}} the American b-film scenarist, Richard Landau, and heavily revised by Val Guest, {{presents}} a heavily compressed version {{of the events of}} the original television serial. The most significant plot change occurs at the climax of the film. In the television version, Quatermass appeals to the last <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creature's humanity and convinces it to commit suicide to save the world. In the film, Quatermass kills the creature by electrocution. Nigel Kneale was critical of the changes made for the film adaptation and of the casting of Brian Donlevy, whose brusque interpretation of Quatermass was not to his liking. To make the film's plot convincing to audiences, Guest employed a high degree of realism, directing the film in a style akin to a newsreel. The film was shot on location in London, Windsor and Bray and at Hammer's Bray Studios. Carroon's transformation was effected by makeup artist Phil Leakey, who worked in conjunction with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to accentuate Wordsworth's naturally gaunt features to give him an alien appearance. Special effects, including a model of the fully mutated creature seen at the climax, were provided by Les Bowie. The music was composed by James Bernard, the first of many scores he wrote for Hammer.|$|E
5|$|There is also {{an older}} {{downtown}} grid system {{that was designed to}} be parallel to the confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek. Most of the streets downtown and in LoDo run northeast–southwest and northwest–southeast. This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal; if the streets were in a normal N–S/E–W grid, only the N–S streets would receive sunlight. With the grid oriented to the diagonal directions, the NW–SE streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the morning and the NE–SW streets receive it in the afternoon. This idea was from Henry Brown the founder of the Brown Palace Hotel. There is now a plaque {{across the street from the}} Brown Palace Hotel which honors this idea. The NW–SE streets are numbered, while the NE–SW streets are named. The named streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the block-long Cheyenne Place. The numbered streets start underneath the Colfax and I-25 viaducts. There are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid. There are also a few <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old grid system in the normal grid, such as Park Avenue, Morrison Road, and Speer Boulevard. Larimer Street, named after William Larimer, Jr., the founder of Denver, which is in the heart of LoDo, is the oldest street in Denver.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, {{influenced}} by the book <b>Vestiges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Natural History of Creation, already suspected that transmutation of species occurred when {{he began his career}} as a naturalist. By 1855, his biogeographical observations during his field work in South America and the Malay Archipelago made him confident enough in a branching pattern of evolution to publish a paper stating that every species originated in close proximity to an already existing closely allied species. Like Darwin, it was Wallace's consideration of how the ideas of Malthus might apply to animal populations that led him to conclusions very similar to those reached by Darwin about the role of natural selection. In February 1858, Wallace, unaware of Darwin's unpublished ideas, composed his thoughts into an essay and mailed them to Darwin, asking for his opinion. The result was the joint publication in July of an extract from Darwin's 1844 essay along with Wallace's letter. Darwin also began work on a short abstract summarising his theory, which he would publish in 1859 as On the Origin of Species.|$|E
2500|$|As the spiritualism {{movement}} {{began to}} fade, partly through <b>the</b> publicity <b>of</b> fraud accusations and partly through <b>the</b> appeal <b>of</b> religious movements such as Christian science, the Spiritualist Church was organised.

50|$|Agriculture {{was vital}} to the early economy, and many street names recall this legacy. The Sunkist plant remains as a living <b>vestige</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> citrus era.
