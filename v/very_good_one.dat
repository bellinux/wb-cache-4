[...] Juli Weiner of Vanity Fair wrote, [...] "the episode was quick, sharp, and consistent". Meredith Blake of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed Tracy's plot here, noting that his attempts to deliver a single line was highly entertaining. The Cornell Daily Suns Scott Eidler said that Jenna and Kenneth's subplot [...] "wasn't laugh-out-loud funny", nonetheless [...] "it was a nice realistic turn for characterization!" [...] Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline deemed [...] "Reaganing" [...] an excellent episode from the series. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club was positive about Jenna and Kenneth's story, noting it went from amusing to hilarious. He was not [...] "overly blown away" [...] with Liz's plot, but said it redeemed itself at the end [...] "by providing another nice moment of connection" [...] between the Jack and Liz characters. Rabin gave [...] "Reaganing" [...] a B+ grade, praising the (non-existent) scene where Jack put pills into Tracy's jelly beans. Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News said that {{the best part of}} the episode was Jack McBrayer's Kenneth [...] "actually [...] some funny lines for the first time [...]" [...] The Fordham Rams Celeste Kmiotek said that the episode was [...] "perhaps more awkward than normal... but it was nonetheless hilarious, and was tempered by its ability to throw cultural references into everything until you almost forget what is actually being discussed." [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett liked Kelsey Grammer's appearance, but mostly enjoyed the fact that 30 Rock devoted an episode to Tina Fey's character as [...] "the sexual equivalent of a million Hindenburgs" [...] and was pleased with the numerous Liz flashbacks from past episodes that were featured here.|$|E

He felt that their presence [...] "elevates the series from merely a <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>one</b> to a truly exceptional one." [...] He believes that they always [...] "make {{the most of their}} screen time", noting how every one of their actions [...] "give an entirely new twist to the events otherwise playing out normally." [...] Carl Kimlinger, also from ANN, adds that [...] "the things those two can do to a well-laid plan are simply appalling." [...] Davey Jones of Active Anime felt the pair was the [...] "highlight of the story" [...] and should have their own series. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment described the two as [...] "very off center in a colorful and fun way" [...] and believed they stood out from the large cast because they were [...] "far more outgoing." [...] He felt that the connections they make {{with the rest of the}} cast [...] "are fun to watch and there's only a kind of elegance to it". Beveridge commented that [...] "when this pair comes on the screen, [...] can’t help but smile" [...] and that he [...] "enjoy all of the scenes that involve [...] because they bring such a lighthearted aspect to the show that’s definitely needed to break up the more intense scenes." [...] DVD Talk's Todd Douglass felt that Isaac and Miria are [...] "the uplifting and energetic component of [...] show," [...] feeling that it is entertaining to see how they influenced the events. Nick Hartel, also from DVD Talk, believed that it would be cruel not to mention them. He described them to be filled with [...] "a maniac energy, often brought to a screeching halt by melodramatic breakdowns over trivial occurrences or bold assumptions." [...] Although he admit they seem to have to place in the series at first, he notes that their interactions with other characters [...] "causes a drastic shift in tone." [...] He comments that as the plot progresses, the pair [...] "become a bright spot as storylines take dark turns and serve as a reminder of the goodness that makes up the vast majority of the world." [...] Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order Podcast and quest Mike Toole believed that out of every other character in the ensemble cast, the pair are the [...] "default protagonists" [...] simply because they meet every other character. They also felt that if ignorance is bliss, they are the happiest people [...] "in the world" [...] because they are [...] "that stupid". The two characters were compared to Bonnie and Clyde, but the reviewers felt that were more like Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, characters from the animated series Dynomutt, Dog Wonder. Even if the events become grim, the reviewers could not help but smile as Isaac and Miria appear. ANN columnist Erin Finnegan described Isaac and Miria as [...] " [...] a couple of completely loveable weirdoes". She agreed that the subplot revolving around them [...] "takes some of the edge off the dark moments." [...] Amanda Tarbet of SequentialTart.com drew parallels between the duo and the trickster god archetype. She compared them to the kitsune of Japanese folklore, which are portrayed [...] "as tricksters, but also as nurturing characters such as guardians and friends".

2500|$|Continuing east the MCC team came to Melbourne to play Victoria, a {{stronger}} proposition than South Australia. Their captain was the Australian opener Colin McDonald and their wicket-keeper Len Maddocks {{and the two}} young bowlers Lindsay Kline and Ian Meckiff who had done well on the recent tour of South Africa. With Peter May still resting his knee vice-captain Colin Cowdrey was in charge, winning the toss and electing to bat on a good wicket. Fred Trueman and Frank Tyson were rested and after Adelaide {{it was decided to}} use both spin bowlers again even though it was thought only one would be used the Tests. Peter Richardson was caught off Meckiff's [...] third ball, whose action caused immediate interest. [...] "He bowled fast left-arm over the wicket with one or two really very quick ones which had the suspicion of a throw about them". Arthur Milton gloved a dropped catch going for hook, but settled down with his Gloucestershire team-mate Tom Graveney who was in fine form. [...] "Long Tom" [...] was out l.b.w. trying to pull a ball that stayed low with the score on 54, but Milton (116) added 197 with Raman Subba Row (83). McDonald brought on Kline (3/126), but his Chinaman were expensive and failed to turn. Meckiff removed Subba Row and Colin Cowdrey was run out by Ian Huntington after he stepped forward after an l.b.w. appeal. Tony Lock came in as nightwatchman and belted 44 in under an hour, which was appreciated by the 26,000 crowd more than Trevor Bailey's slow innings. Everybody made double figures except the first and last batsmen and the MCC totalled 396, Meckiff (4/69) being the best of the Victorian bowlers. Brian Statham and Peter Loader opened the bowling, but after [...] "George" [...] bowled opener Neil Crompton Laker and Lock were brought on and each took a wicket, Laker getting McDonald for 53 and Lock Allen Aylett for 23. After the rest day Victoria resumed on 119/3 and Statham demonstrated why his motto was [...] "if they miss, I hit" [...] catching one wicket leg before and clean bowling another five in his 7/47, including Ian Huntington for 73. When asked about the slow pitch he replied [...] "Well, if it's slow you’ve got to bowl faster" [...] With Victoria out for 252 the MCC had a lead of 144 and went for quick runs. Milton was run out by Huntington when sent back by Richardson (40), but Tom Graveney (78 not out) took the score to 149/3 and Cowdrey declared on the fourth morning after the two minutes silence for Remembrance Day. Victoria needed 296 runs in four hours and to McDonald's credit he went for the win, top-scoring with 62. Statham had no luck, Laker and Loader were ill with sun-stroke, but Tony Lock took 6/70, helped by three catches in a row by Milton. He managed to find turn and bounce and won the game by taking two wickets in the last over of the day. The tourists thought Ian Meckiff was a thrower, but not a <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>one,</b> no complaint was made and the MCC lost the chance ensure that he did not play in the Tests without too much fuss.|$|E
