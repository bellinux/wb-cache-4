40|$|A static {{cold flow}} scale model test was {{performed}} {{in order to determine}} the internal performance characteristics of various STOVL exhaust systems. All of the concepts considered included a vectorable cruise nozzle and a separate vectorable vertical thrust <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> mounted on the tailpipe. The two <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> configurations tested featured vectorable constant thickness cascade vanes for area control and improved performance during transition and vertical lift flight. The best transition performance was achieved using a butterfly door type <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> and a pitch vectoring 2 DCD or axisymmetric cruise nozzle. The clamshell blocker type of <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> had reduced transition performance due to the choking of the tailpipe flow upstream of the cruise nozzle...|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} {{performance of}} two exhaust system concepts applicable to single-engine short-take-off and vertical-landing tactical fighter configurations was investigated. These concepts involved blocking (or partially blocking) tailpipe {{flow to the}} rear (cruise) nozzle and diverting it through an opening to a <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> exit for vertical thrust. A set of variable angle vanes at the <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> exit were used to vary <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> thrust angle between 45 and 110 deg relative to the positive axial force direction. In the vertical flight mode the rear nozzle (or tailpipe flow to it) was completely blocked. In the transition flight mode flow in the tailpipe was split between the rear and ventral nozzles and the flow was vectored at both exits for aircraft control purposes through this flight regime. In the cruise flight mode the <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> was sealed and all flow exited through the rear nozzle...|$|E
40|$|Short {{take-off}} {{and vertical}} landing (STOVL) <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> concepts are investigated {{by means of}} a static cold flow scale model at a NASA facility. The internal aerodynamic performance characteristics of the cruise, transition, and vertical lift modes are considered for four <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> types. The nozzle configurations examined include those with: butterfly-type inner doors and vectoring exit vanes; circumferential inner doors and thrust vectoring vanes; a three-port segmented version with circumferential inner doors; and a two-port segmented version with cylindrical nozzle exit shells. During the testing, internal and external pressure is measured, and the thrust and flow coefficients and resultant vector angles are obtained. The inner door used for <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> flow control is found to affect performance negatively during the initial phase of transition. The best thrust performance is demonstrated by the two-port segmented <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> due to the elimination of the inner door...|$|E
40|$|A {{full-scale}} {{model of a}} supersonic STOVL single engine flighter aircraft employing an ejector to augment lift in hover and in low-speed flight was tested in the 40 - by 80 -ft and 80 - by 120 -ft test sections of the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex located at the NASA Ames Research Center. The measured ejector augmentation ratio in hover met the design requirement of 1. 6 and continued to provide the lift necessary in forward flight for good transition qualities. The up-and-away aerodynamics (ejector system stowed) {{were found to be}} conventional for this class of vehicle. The pitch control provided by the full-span blown flaps is sufficient to control the large pitching moments generated by <b>ventral</b> exhaust <b>nozzle</b> vectoring and propulsion induced aerodynamic effects such as the turning of the flow entrained into the ejectors...|$|R
40|$|In the 1980 s NASA Aeronautics was {{actively}} involved in full-scale wind tunnel testing of promising VSTOL aircraft concepts. This presentation looks at two, a multi-role fighter and a subsonic tactical transport. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed {{with some of the}} rationale that ultimately led to the selection of competing concepts for production, namely the V- 22 Osprey and the F- 35 Lightning. The E 7 -A STOVL multi-role fighter was the product of an aircraft development program in the late 1980 s by NASA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Canadian Department of Industry Science and Technology (DIST), and industry partners General Dynamics and Boeing Dehavilland. The program was conducted an in response to increasing US-UK interest in supersonic STOVL fighters. The objective was to design an aircraft that could replace most existing close air support-air combat fighters with a single aircraft that had some of the qualities of an air superiority fighter and the deployment flexibility of a VSTOL aircraft. The resulting E 7 -A concept was a delta-wing supersonic fighter that used a fuselage-mounted thrust augmenting ejector and a <b>ventral</b> deflecting jet <b>nozzle</b> for vertical lift. The Grumman Aircraft Company, the Navy, and NASA developed the Design- 698 (D- 698) subsonic tactical transport in response to the Navy's Type A VSTOL utility aircraft requirement. The objective was to develop a subsonic utility transport with the operational flexibility of a helicopter, but with greater speed and range. The D- 698 employs two high-bypass turbofan engines mounted on a dumbbell that rotates through ninety degrees for vertical takeoff and cruise flight. Movable vanes positioned in the exhaust flow provide control in hover with the need for reaction control jets. The presentations concluding comments suggest that technology advances in the last thirty-years may justify the value of revisiting some of these concepts...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of three variations of a <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> system for supersonic short-takeoff and vertical-landing (SSTOVL) aircraft was performed at the NASA LeRC Powered Lift Facility. These test results include the effects of an annular duct flow into the ventral duct, a blocked tailpipe, and a short ventral duct length. An analytical study was also performed on the short ventral duct configuration using the PARC 3 D computational dynamics code. Data presented include pressure losses, thrust and flow performance, internal flow visualization, and pressure distributions at the exit plane of the <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle...</b>|$|E
40|$|Short takeoff and {{vertical}} landing (STOVL) aircraft {{are planned for}} possible future development. For these aircraft, the same propulsion system will provide power for lift, hover, and horizontal flight. To accomplish this, many designs include a <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> to provide part of the vertical thrust required. Understanding and predicting the internal aerodynamic flow caused by a single exhaust duct opening are highly desirable in assessing this concept. A numerical simulation of a <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> is presented {{and the results are}} compared with experimental data. Comparisons include visualizations of the flow along the ventral duct walls and in the tailpipe plane of symmetry. Performance calculations are also compared with measured values...|$|E
40|$|Aircraft with supersonic, short takeoff and {{vertical}} landing capability {{have been proposed}} to replace some of the current high-performance aircraft. Several of these configurations use a <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> in the lower fuselage, aft {{of the center of}} gravity, for lift or pitch control. Internal vanes canted at 20 deg were added to a swivel-type <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> and tested at tailpipe to ambient pressure ratios up to 5. 0 on the Powered Lift Facility at NASA Lewis Research Center. The addition of sets of four or seven vanes decreased the discharge coefficient of the nozzle by at least 6 percent and did not effect the thrust coefficient. Side force produced by the nozzle with vanes was 14 {{percent or more of the}} vertical force. In addition, this side force caused only a smalll loss in vertical force in comparison to the nozzle without vanes. The net thrust force was 8 deg from the vertical for four vanes and 10. 5 deg for seven...|$|E
40|$|Flow in {{a generic}} <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> system was studied {{experimentally}} and analytically with the PARC 3 D {{computational fluid dynamics}} program (a full Navier-Stokes equations solver) in order to evaluate the program's ability to predict system performance and internal flow patterns. A generic model of a tailpipe with a rectangular <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle,</b> about one-third of full size, was tested with unheated air at steady-state pressure ratios up to 4. 0. Measurements showed about 5. 5 percent flow-turning loss and reasonable nozzle performance coefficients. The flow turned more than the designed 90 deg, causing an aftward axial component in the total thrust. Flow behavior into and through the ventral duct is discussed and illustrated with paint streak flow visualization photographs. PARC 3 D graphic images are shown for comparison with the experiment photographs. The program successfully predicted internal flow patterns; it also computed thrust and discharge coefficients within 1 percent of measured values...|$|E
40|$|The hover thrust {{performance}} of a full-scale model of an ejector-lift/vectored thrust Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) fighter configuration was measured at the Outdoor Aerodynamic Research Facility of the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex located at NASA Ames Research Center. The static thrust of the lifting ejector and <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> was calibrated at an out-of-ground-effect height. The test permitted comparison with static thrust calibrations obtained in the 80 - by 120 -Foot Wind Tunnel. The average static thrust augmentation ratio of the ejector system was 1. 55 compared with the design goal of 1. 63. The outdoor test showed that the addition of short extensions to the diffuser on the fuselage sidewall decreased suckdown and increased ejector performance. As expected, {{an increase in the}} <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> thrust deflection angle from nearly horizontal to the vertical-lift hover position caused a significant decrease in thrust. Flow visualization using smoke revealed greater secondary airflow into the left ejector and the penetration of hot ventral gases along the ground beneath and between the cool plumes from the ejector system...|$|E
40|$|A generic one-third {{scale model}} of a {{tailpipe}} offtake system for a supersonic short takeoff vertical landing (SSTOVL) aircraft was tested at LeRC Powered Lift Facility. The model consisted of a tailpipe with twin elbows, offtake ducts, and flow control nozzles, plus a small <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> and a blind flange to simulate a blocked cruise nozzle. The offtake flow turned through a total angle of 177 degrees relative to the tailpipe inlet axis. The flow split was 45 percent to each offtake and 10 percent to the <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The main test objective was to collect data for comparison {{to the performance of}} the same configuration predicted by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. Only the experimental results are given - the analytical results are published in a separate paper. Performance tests were made with unheated air at tailpipe-to-ambient pressure ratios up to 5. The total pressure loss through the offtakes was as high as 15. 5 percent. All test results are shown as graphs, contour plots, and wall pressure distributions. The complex flow patterns in the tailpipe and elbows at the offtake openings are described with traversing flow angle probe and paint streak flow visualization data...|$|E
40|$|A {{traditional}} F 110 -type {{turbofan engine}} model {{was extended to}} include a <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> and two thrust-augmenting ejectors for Short Take-Off Vertical Landing (STOVL) aircraft applications. Development of the real-time F 110 /STOVL simulation required {{special attention to the}} modeling approach to component performance maps, the low pressure turbine exit mixing region, and the tailpipe dynamic approximation. Simulation validation derives by comparing output from the ADSIM simulation with the output for a validated F 110 /STOVL General Electric Aircraft Engines FORTRAN deck. General Electric substantiated basic engine component characteristics through factory testing and full scale ejector data...|$|E
40|$|Flow in {{a generic}} <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> system was studied {{experimentally}} and analytically with a block {{version of the}} PARC 3 D computational fluid dynamics program (a full Navier-Stokes equation solver) in order to evaluate the program's ability to predict system performance and internal flow patterns. For the experimental work a one-third-size model tailpipe with a single large rectangular <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> mounted normal to the tailpipe axis was tested with unheated air at steady-state pressure ratios up to 4. 0. The end of the tailpipe was closed to simulate a blocked exhaust nozzle. Measurements showed about 5 1 / 2 percent flow-turning loss, reasonable nozzle performance coefficients, and a significant aftward axial component of thrust due to flow turning loss, reasonable nozzle performance coefficients, and a significant aftward axial component of thrust due to flow turning more than 90 deg. Flow behavior into and through the ventral duct is discussed and illustrated with paint streak flow visualization photographs. For the analytical work the same ventral system configuration was modeled with two computational grids to evaluate the effect of grid density. Both grids gave good results. The finer-grid solution produced more detailed flow patterns and predicted performance parameters, such as thrust and discharge coefficient, within 1 percent of the measured values. PARC 3 D flow visualization images are shown for comparison with the paint streak photographs. Modeling and computational issues encountered in the analytical work are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Several {{proposed}} configurations for supersonic short takeoff, {{vertical landing}} aircraft will require {{one or more}} ventral nozzles for lift and pitch control. The swivel nozzle is one possible <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> configuration. A swivel nozzle (approximately one-third scale) was built and tested on a generic model tailpipe. This nozzle was capable of vectoring the flow up to + or - 23 deg from the vertical position. Steady-state performance data were obtained at pressure ratios to 4. 5, and pitot-pressure surveys of the nozzle exit plane were made. Two configurations were tested: the swivel nozzle with a square contour of {{the leading edge of}} the ventral duct inlet, and the same nozzle with a round leading edge contour. The swivel nozzle showed good performance overall, and the round-leading edge configuration showed an improvement in performance over the square-leading edge configuration...|$|E
40|$|Flow {{through a}} {{combined}} ventral and axial exhaust nozzle system was studied experimentally and analytically. The work {{is part of}} an ongoing propulsion technology effort at NASA Lewis Research Center for short takeoff, vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft. The experimental investigation was done on the NASA Lewis Powered Lift Facility. The experiment consisted of performance testing over a range of tailpipe pressure ratios from 1 to 3. 2 and flow visualization. The analytical investigation consisted of modeling the same configuration and solving for the flow using the PARC 3 D computational fluid dynamics program. The comparison of experimental and analytical results was very good. The <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle</b> performance coefficients obtained from both the experimental and analytical studies agreed within 1. 2 percent. The net horizontal thrust of the nozzle system contained a significant reverse thrust component created by the flow overturning in the ventral duct. This component resulted in a low net horizontal thrust coefficient. The experimental and analytical studies showed very good agreement in the internal flow patterns...|$|E
40|$|A large-scale, ejector-lift V/STOL Model, {{powered by}} a J- 97 engine, was tested at the NASA Ames Research Center Outdoor Aerodynamics Research Facility. The model {{incorporated}} the external augmentor concept developed by DHC. Since the first test at Ames in 1979, the fuselage augmentor nozzle array has been redesigned with a larger pitch and notched nozzles instead of plain slot nozzles. Thrust augmentation of the ejector as measured at Ames Research Center was lower than that measured in the DHC laboratory. It is believed that this difference {{is due to the}} high temperature of the primary jet flow as compared to the DHC blown-down rig. An ejector-lift/vectored thrust configuration was also included in the recent tests. This is an arrangement where the fuselage augmentor is shortened in the chordwise direction and the extra thrust is generated with a vectorable, <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle.</b> In free air the shortened fuselage augmentor produced the same augmentation as the long augmentor. In ground proximity, at a height of 27 in, and with zero pitch angle, a negative ground effect was measured equal to 6. 5 percent of the free-air lift...|$|E
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} inverse transformation {{flight control}} system design method {{is applied to the}} Lockheed Ft. Worth Company's E- 7 D short takeoff and vertical land (STOVL) supersonic fighter/attack aircraft design with a modified General Electric F 110 engine which has augmented propulsive lift capability. The system is fully augmented to provide flight path control and velocity control, and rate command attitude hold for angular axes during the transition and hover operations. In cruise mode, the {{flight control system}} is configured to provide direct thrust command, rate command attitude hold for pitch and roll axes, and sideslip command with turn coordination. A control selector based on the nonlinear inverse transformation method is designed specifically to be compatible with the propulsion system's physical configuration which has a two dimensional convergent-divergent aft nozzle, a vectorable <b>ventral</b> <b>nozzle,</b> and a thrust augmented ejector. The nonlinear inverse transformation is used to determine the propulsive forces and nozzle deflections, which in combination with the aerodynamic forces and moments (including propulsive induced contributions), and gravitational force, are required to achieve the longitudinal and vertical acceleration commands. The longitudinal control axes are fully decoupled within the propulsion system's performance envelope. A piloted motion-base flight simulation was conducted on the Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) at NASA Ames Research Center to examine the handling qualities of this design. Based on results of the simulation, refinements to the control system have been made and will also be covered in the report...|$|E
