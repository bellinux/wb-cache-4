5|$|Ceramics lend {{themselves}} to circular motifs, whether radial or tangential. Bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes; these may be partly figurative, representing stylised leaves or flower petals, while circular bands can run around a bowl or jug. Patterns of these types were employed on Islamic ceramics from the Ayyubid period, 13thcentury. Radially symmetric flowers with, say, 6 petals {{lend themselves}} to increasingly stylised geometric designs which can combine geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs, brightly coloured glazes, and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery. Potters often chose patterns suited {{to the shape of}} the vessel they were making. Thus an unglazed earthenware water flask from Aleppo {{in the shape of a}} <b>vertical</b> <b>circle</b> (with handles and neck above) is decorated with a ring of moulded braiding around an Arabic inscription with a small 8-petalled flower at the centre.|$|E

For several minutes, groups of 2-20 birds simultaneously and repeatedly fly around one another in large, <b>vertical</b> <b>circles,</b> while swinging the tail streamers from side to side. If the female likes the presentation, she will mate with the male in his prospective nest-site. Occasionally, disputes will occur between males trying to protect their mates and nesting areas.|$|R
50|$|In astronomy, a <b>vertical</b> <b>circle</b> is a {{great circle}} on the {{celestial}} sphere that is perpendicular to the horizon. Therefore, it passes through the zenith and the nadir. There is a <b>vertical</b> <b>circle</b> for any given azimuth, where azimuth is the angle measured east from the north on the celestial horizon. The <b>vertical</b> <b>circle</b> {{which is on the}} east-west direction is called the prime vertical.

50|$|The male {{blue-backed manakin}} has a {{fascinating}} breeding display, unusual {{in that it}} is a cooperative display rather than competitive. Two males perch next to each other on a bare stick and jump up and down alternately, giving a buzzing call. When a female approaches, the perched bird moves backwards under the jumping bird, so the two perform a <b>vertical</b> <b>circling</b> movement. Groups of up to eight birds may perform together, with a different stick for each pair of displaying males. The female builds a twig nest in a tree; two brown-mottled white eggs are laid, and incubated entirely by the female for about 20 days.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{a machine}} {{learning}} (ML) approach is presented that exploits accelerometers data {{to deal with}} gesture recognition (GR) problems. The proposed methodology aims at providing high accuracy classification for home automation systems, which are generally user independent, device independent, and device orientation independent, an heterogeneous scenario {{that has not been}} fully investigated in previous GR literature. The approach illustrated in this paper is composed of three main steps: event identification; feature extraction; and ML-based classification. The elements of the novelty of the proposed approach are 1) a preprocessing phase based on principal component analysis to increase the performance in real-world scenario conditions and 2) the development of parsimonious novel classification techniques based on sparse Bayesian learning. This methodology is tested on two datasets of four gesture classes (horizontal, <b>vertical,</b> <b>circles,</b> and eight-shaped movements) and on a further dataset with eight classes. In order to authentically describe a real-world home automation environment, the gesture movements are collected from more than 30 people who freely perform any gesture. It results in a dictionary of 12 and 20 different movements, respectively, {{in the case of the}} four-class and the eight-class databases...|$|R

50|$|The {{instrument}} must be {{level for}} this method to work directly. If the instrument {{line of sight}} is inclined, the horizontal and vertical distance components must be determined. Some instruments have additional graduations on a <b>vertical</b> <b>circle</b> to assist with these inclined measurements. These graduated circles, known as stadia circles, provide {{the value of the}} horizontal and the vertical measurements {{as a percentage of the}} direct stadia measurement.|$|E

50|$|The {{theodolite}} {{became a}} modern, accurate instrument in 1787, {{with the introduction}} of Jesse Ramsden's famous great theodolite, which he created using a very accurate dividing engine of his own design. The demand could not be met by foreign theodolites owing to their inadequate precision, hence all instruments meeting high precision requirements were made in England. Despite the many German instrument builders {{at the turn of the}} century, there were no usable German theodolites available. A transition was brought about by Breithaupt and the symbiosis of Utzschneider, Reichenbach and Fraunhofer.As technology progressed, in the 1840s, the <b>vertical</b> partial <b>circle</b> was replaced with a full <b>circle,</b> and both <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>circles</b> were finely graduated. This was the transit theodolite. Theodolites were later adapted to a wider variety of mountings and uses. In the 1870s, an interesting waterborne version of the theodolite (using a pendulum device to counteract wave movement) was invented by Edward Samuel Ritchie. It was used by the U.S. Navy to take the first precision surveys of American harbors on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.|$|R
40|$|The toy {{model of}} a {{particle}} on a <b>vertical</b> rotating <b>circle</b> {{in the presence of}} uniform gravitational / magnetic fields is explored in detail. After an analysis of the classical mechanics of the problem we then discuss the quantum mechanics from both exact and semi–classical standpoints. Exact solutions of the Schrödinger equation are obtained in some cases by diverse methods. Instantons, bounces are constructed and semi-classical, leading order tunneling amplitudes/decay rates are written down. We also investigate qualitatively the nature of small oscillations about the kink/bounce solutions. Finally, the connections of these toy examples with field theoretic and statistical mechanical models of relevance are pointed out...|$|R
25|$|The prime <b>vertical</b> (the great <b>circle</b> {{taking in}} the zenith and east point on the horizon) is divided into twelve, and these {{divisions}} are projected on to the ecliptic along great circles that take {{in the north and}} south points on the horizon.

50|$|The transit {{instrument}} {{consists of a}} horizontal axis in the direction east and west resting on firmly fixed supports, and having a telescope fixed {{at right angles to}} it, revolving freely in the plane of the meridian.

5000|$|Both axes of a {{theodolite}} {{are equipped}} with graduated circles that can be read through magnifying lenses. (R. Anders helped M. Denham discover this technology in 1864.) The <b>vertical</b> <b>circle</b> which 'transits' about the horizontal axis should read 90° (100 grad) when the sight axis is horizontal, or 270° (300 grad) when the instrument is in its second position, that is, [...] "turned over" [...] or [...] "plunged" [...] (zenith angles).

50|$|The main survey {{instrument}} from 1802 {{for the primary}} triangles was a Great Theodolite made by William Cary. This was {{very similar to the}} instruments used in France and Britain for previous trigonometrical surveys. It had a horizontal circle that was 36 inches wide and the readings were taken using a microscope. The <b>vertical</b> graduated <b>circle</b> was 18 inches in diameter. It weighed about half a ton and needed twelve men to carry it. Lambton measured all three angles of triangles in several cases to establish the spherical excess (angles of triangles on a sphere sum up greater than 180°). When the survey was carried out from Madras to Bangalore, Lambton was able to compare the Bangalore baseline of 1804 with the calculated measurements and the difference was about three and a half inches.|$|R
