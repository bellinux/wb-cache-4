One skeptic asserts that practices, such as [...] "facilitated communication for infantile autism"; memory-recovery techniques including body work; and other therapies, such as rebirthing and reparenting, may be dubious or even dangerous, despite their popularity.

In the same year fires also targeted MCC churches, two in January and April destroyed the [...] "mother church" [...] of the MCC in Los Angeles, and in July the San Francisco MCC was destroyed by arson. MCC church founder Troy Perry flew in to oversee {{a memorial service for}} the victims of the New Orleans fire. Perry, in searching for a church to hold the service was turned down by every church but one, St. Marks United Methodist Church. Years earlier the congregation's representative to the board of the Greater New Orleans Federation of Churches had resigned because the federation refused admission to the New Orleans MCC. Attending the service was the only religious official to publicly show any support, he was from a small Methodist church, a married minister Finis Crutchfield. It was later revealed Crutchfield was a closeted gay man but rose within the Methodist Church to become a bishop in the Texas conference. As part of the now annual Gay Rights Parade Day at the end of June (to mark the anniversary of the 1969 Stonewall Riots) the Miami celebration of 200 marchers later held a memorial service for the gays killed in the fire. Perry had also telegrammed the Roman Catholic Governor, Edwin Edwards, to declare a day of mourning for the fire victims but after first denying the telegram had been delivered, declined to respond, then stated that the governor was away. Because the victims were all patrons at a gay bar several families refused to claim their sons. Perry and MCC associates made arrangements for services and created a national appeal for funds to aid the victims. It was the first national fundraising in the gay community and brought in $13,000 ($ in present-day terms).

40|$|Men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM) in the USA, {{represent}} a vulnerable population with lower rates of HIV testing. There are various specific attributes of HIV testing that may impact willingness to test (WTT) for HIV. Identifying specific attributes influencing patients' decisions around WTT for HIV is critical to ensure improved HIV testing uptake. This study examined WTT for HIV by using conjoint analysis, an innovative method for systematically estimating consumer preferences across discrete attributes. WTT for HIV was assessed across eight hypothetical HIV testing scenarios varying across seven dichotomous attributes: location (home <b>vs.</b> <b>clinic),</b> price (free <b>vs.</b> $ 50), sample collection (finger prick vs. blood), timeliness of results (immediate vs. 1 - 2 weeks), privacy (anonymous vs. confidential), results given (by phone vs. in-person), and type of counseling (brochure vs. in-person). Seventy-five MSM were recruited from a community-based organization providing HIV testing services in Los Angeles to participate in conjoint analysis. WTT for HIV score was based on a 100 -point scale. Scores ranged from 32. 2 to 80. 3 for eight hypothetical HIV testing scenarios. Price of HIV testing (free vs. $ 50) had the highest impact on WTT (impact score = 31. 4, SD= 29. 2, p < 0. 0001), followed by timeliness of results (immediate vs. 1 - 2 weeks) (impact score= 13. 9, SD= 19. 9, p≤ 0. 0001) and testing location (home <b>vs.</b> <b>clinic)</b> (impact score= 10. 3, SD= 22. 8, p= 0. 0002). Impacts of other HIV testing attributes were not significant. Conjoint analysis method enabled direct assessment of HIV testing preferences and identified specific attributes that significantly impact WTT for HIV among MSM. This method provided empirical evidence to support the potential uptake of the newly FDA-approved over-the-counter HIV home test kit with immediate results, with cautionary note on the cost of the kit. © 2013 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 150 research reports summarizing {{the results of}} multiple behavior domain interventions examined theoretical predictions {{about the effects of}} the included number of recommendations on behavioral and clinical change in the domains of smoking, diet, and physical activity. The meta-analysis yielded 3 main conclusions. First, there is a curvilinear relation between the number of behavioral recommendations and improvements in behavioral and clinical measures, with a moderate number of recommendations producing the highest level of change. A moderate number of recommendations is likely to be associated with stronger effects because the intervention ensures the necessary level of motivation to implement the recommended changes, thereby increasing compliance with the goals set by the intervention, without making the intervention excessively demanding. Second, this curve was more pronounced when samples were likely to have low motivation to change, such as when interventions were delivered to nonpatient (vs. patient) populations, were implemented in nonclinic (<b>vs.</b> <b>clinic)</b> settings, used lay community (vs. expert) facilitators, and involved group (vs. individual) delivery formats. Finally, change in behavioral outcomes mediated the effects of number of recommended behaviors on clinical change.

Associations between socio-demographic, reproductive and lifestyle factors, medical conditions and recurrent symptoms and using treatment (or not) were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Among infertile women who had used treatment (community <b>vs</b> <b>clinic),</b> women from clinics had lower odds of living outside major cities, using hormones only, i. e., not IVF, or recurrent headaches/migraines, severe tiredness, or stiff/painful joints; and higher odds of recent diagnoses of urinary tract infection or anxiety disorder. Compared to infertile women who had not used treatment, women from clinics had lower odds of living outside major cities, recurrent allergies or severe tiredness; and higher odds of having private health insurance for hospital or ancillary services, recent diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome or recurrent constipation.

However, issues relating to the area such as comparisons across modalities, comparisons of school vs. clinical populations, and developmental delay vs. pathology have not been addressed in the same, comprehensive study. In the current study, therefore, familiar gesture production in DCD was addressed in a comprehensive manner to follow-up outstanding issues from previous studies: The production of familiar gestures and praxis imagery in a school (n = 26) <b>vs.</b> <b>clinic</b> sample (n = 19) of children with DCD was examined in relation to typically developing age matched (n = 24) all aged from 9 to 11 years, and two groups of younger children within the age ranges of 5 – 6 (n = 23) and 4 – 5 (n = 26) years. Overall, children with Developmental Coordination Disorder showed an impaired ability to produce familiar gestures compared to their typical peers, and this was dependant on the type of gesture and presentation modality. Differences were found between school and clinic samples of children with DCD, suggestive of the recruitment of different underlying mechanisms in the two samples.

Of these 2, 611 samples, 32 (1. 2 %) were repeatedly reactive. Antibodies to gp 140 / 105 env were found in 4 / 32 by HIV- 2 WB, and in 1 / 4 by radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA). These 4 HIV- 2 WB-positive samples were also reactive with gp 160 / 120 env in HIV- 1 WB, suggesting cross-reactivity. In a spot test with synthetic peptides of the transmembrane glycoprotein of both HIV types, 3 / 4 were only HIV- 1 positive and 1 / 4 was strongly HIV- 2 positive and weakly HIV- 1 positive.

Gonorrhoea without subjective symptoms was found in 23 per cent. of the men and 50 per cent. of the women. Gonorrhoea was found in association with scabies in 9 out of 18 men and in 3 out of 5 women. A rising incidence of pharyngeal gonococcal infections has been noticed at the clinic and the figures for 1972 were 6 per cent. of the men and 9 per cnet. of the women with gonorrhoea. The route of infection was usually oro-genital contact, but in some cases other routes had to be considered. It was not possible to define a promiscuous group of patients suitable for a planned study of prophylactic treatment, as only 2 per cent. of the men and 1 per cent. of the women had had nore than one gonococcal infection during the preceding year. The standard treatment for genital gonorrhoea (ampicillin 2 times 1 g. orally with a 5 -hour interval) was very satisfactory and gave a 98 per cent. cure rate.

40|$|Importance The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model holds {{promise for}} {{improving}} primary care delivery, {{but it has}} not been adequately tested in teaching settings. Design, Setting, and Participants We implemented an intervention guided by PCMH principles at a safety-net teaching clinic with resident physician providers. Two similar clinics served as controls. Main Outcomes and Measures Using a cross-sectional design, we measured the effect on patient and re sident satisfaction using the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey and a validated teaching clinic survey, respectively. Both surveys were conducted at baseline and 1 year after the intervention. We also measured the effect on emergency department and hospital utilization. Results Following implementation of our intervention, the clinic's score on the National Committee for Quality Assurance's PCMH certification tool improved from 35 to 53 of 100 possible points, although our clinic did not achieve all must-pass elements to qualify as a PCMH. During the 1 -year study period, 4676 patients were exposed to the intervention; 39. 9 %of these used at least 1 program component. Compared with baseline, patient-reported access and overall satisfaction improved to a greater extent in the intervention clinic, and the composite satisfaction rating increased from 48 %to 65 %in the intervention <b>clinic</b> <b>vs</b> from 50 % to 59 %in the control sites (P =. 04). The improvements were particularly notable for questions relating to access. For example, satisfaction with urgent appointment scheduling increased from 12 %to 53 %in the intervention <b>clinic</b> <b>vs</b> from 14 %to 18 %in the control clinics (P < 001). Resident satisfaction also improved in the intervention clinic: the composite satisfaction score increased from 39 %to 51 % in the intervention <b>clinic</b> <b>vs</b> a decrease from 46 %to 42 %in the control clinics (P =. 01). Emergency department utilization did not differ significantly between the intervention and control clinics, and hospitalizations increased from 26 to 27 visits per 1000 patients per month in the intervention <b>clinic</b> <b>vs</b> a decrease from 28 to 25 in the control clinics (P =. 02). Conclusions and Relevance Our PCMH-guided intervention, which represented a modest but substantive step toward the PCMH vision, had favorable effects on patient and resident satisfaction at a safety-net teaching clinic but did not reduce emergency department or hospital utilization in the first year. Our experience may provide lessons for other teaching clinics in safety-net settings hoping to implement PCMH-guided reforms...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} economic and demographic trends upon the costs and provision of health services among countries {{at different stages of}} development, and in particular how different financing methods lead to different roles for the Ministry of Health—and the likelihood they create of a public health system crisis. First, the trends in Medical Technology, demographics and national health spending as projected by the OECD, the WHO and the Society of Actuaries is presented. The analysis proceeds to examine divergences between sub-sectors (elderly v. young, poor v. rich, urban v. rural, hospital <b>v.</b> <b>clinic</b> or doctor). Special attention is given {{to the question of whether}} a widening gap between groups (urban v. rural, rich v. poor) will cause average per capita expenditures to rise more or less rapidly, and the extent to which it may cause of result from public v. private financing. The ability of financing mechanisms to promote or disrupt harmony in response to two major challenges (1. Rising Costs 2. Biologic Catastrophe) are then discussed. Careful attention is given to the differences in the causes of individual health expenditures and national health expenditures, and the relationship of each to income of the person, or of the national as a whole. This provides a foundation for a typology of Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance responses to (a) Long Term Trends and (B) Public Perceptions. The economics of budgeting is shown to be a task that is both inherently technical, and also political, relying ultimately on public support. It is concluded that it is up to the people and the political process to determine the amount of money in total available to pay for health care costs, and the task of the national health authority to use that funding wisely to obtain the best health outcomes, satisfaction with care, and trust between patients, physicians and hospitals...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes is a {{significant}} complication of b-thalassaemia major. The aetiology includes iron overload causing b-cell destruction, autoimmunity, insulin resistance secondary to liver disease and development of type 1 or 2 diabetes. There are specific issues for patients with diabetes and thalassaemia which will be discussed here. Impaired carbohydrate metabolism must be detected early, to allow intensification of iron chelation. As life expectancy in thalassaemia rises, diabetic complications are seen. Optimising blood glucose and cardiovascular risk factor control is essential. Insulin remains critical for severely symptomatic patients. With milder hyperglycaemia, oral antidiabetic drugs are increasingly used. At Whittington Hospital, we wanted to address these issues. In 2005, we developed a unique Joint Diabetes Thalassaemia Clinic, where patients are reviewed jointly by specialist teams, including Consultant Diabetologist and Haematologist. The Joint Clinic aims to optimise diabetes, endocrine and thalassaemia care, while supporting patient self-management. A retrospective audit of the Joint Clinic (2005 - 09), showed improvement in glycaemic control, (Fructosamine falling from 344 umol/l to 319 umol/l). We compared our cohort to the National Diabetes Audit for England (2007 - 08). Patients attending the Joint Clinic achieved better glycaemic control (target reached: 73 % Joint <b>Clinic</b> <b>vs.</b> 63 % Nationally), blood pressure control (target reached: 58 % Joint <b>Clinic</b> <b>vs.</b> 30 % Nationally) and cholesterol control (target reached: 81 % Joint <b>Clinic</b> <b>vs.</b> 78 % Nationally). 22. 7 % of our patients had ≥ 1 microvascular complication. A significant proportion had endocrinopathies (86 % hypogonadism, 23 % hypoparathyroidism, 18 % hypothyroidism). Managing diabetes {{is one of the}} greatest challenges a person with thalassaemia can face. Training people to self-manage their diabetes and providing support from specialist teams working together are critical. The unique partnership working of our Joint Diabetes Thalassaemia Clinic allows these very complex patients to be managed effectively...|$|R
