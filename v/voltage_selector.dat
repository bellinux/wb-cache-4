50|$|This {{series is}} {{originally}} {{based on the}} license of the Swedish company ASEA. It was produced {{in order to be}} used as a universal locomotive, for both passenger and freight traffic. There was a need to have a powerful electric locomotive to pull freight. At that time, this was mainly on the mainline tracks, which were electrified, and prepared for 160 km/h. Originally, it had diode <b>voltage</b> <b>selector.</b> A later, modernised series, the 3xx subseries, include thyristor <b>voltage</b> <b>selector,</b> and an on-board computer. Later 3xx series have an onboard look-behind-camera for video surveillance of the sides and also new livery.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{implementation}} {{and analysis of}} a variation tolerant version of a switch-to-switch link in a NoC. The goal is to tolerate the effects of process variations on NoC architectures using self-correcting links that automatically detect delay variations and compensate them. The correction is applied without increasing the switch-to-switch latency by substituting the output flip-flops of the sending switch with a self-correcting flip-flop followed by an adaptive <b>voltage</b> swing <b>selector.</b> Higher delay variations {{will result in a}} smaller slack in the switch-to-switch path, but the adaptive <b>voltage</b> swing <b>selector</b> could mitigate its impact on the NoC communication by increasing the voltage swing on the link, thus allowing a compensation of the delay variation. As a result, it is possible to tolerate delay variations at the cost of additional power consumption...|$|R

[...] These differences run deeper than nomenclature though. The Multiple Arbitrary Function Generator (or MARF) goes well beyond what a typical sequencer is capable of performing and is capable of acting as an envelope generator, LFO, CV <b>selector,</b> <b>voltage</b> quantizer or tracking generator.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Direct Torque Control (DTC) of Induction Motor drive has quick torque {{response}} without complex orientation {{transformation and}} inner loop current control. DTC has some drawbacks, {{such as the}} torque and flux ripple. The control scheme performance relies on the accurate selection of the switching voltage vector. This proposed simple structured neural network based new identification method for flux position estimation, sector selection and stator voltage vector selection for induction motors using direct torque control (DTC) method. The ANN based speed controller has been introduced to achieve good dynamic performance of induction motor drive. The Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation technique {{has been used to}} train the neural network. Proposed simple structured network facilitates a short training and processing times. The stator flux is estimated by using the modified integration with amplitude limiter algorithms to overcome drawbacks of pure integrator. The conventional flux position estimator, sector <b>selector</b> and stator <b>voltage</b> vector <b>selector</b> based modified direct torque control (MDTC) scheme compared with the proposed scheme and the results are validated through both by simulation and experimentation...|$|R

Opposite the wire bundle is the back face of the power supply, with an air vent and an IEC 60320 C14 connector to supply AC power. There may be a power switch and/or a <b>voltage</b> <b>selector</b> switch.|$|E
40|$|The enantiomers of vildagliptin, an orally {{available}} and selective dipeptidyl-peptidase- 4 inhibitor {{used for the}} treatment of type II diabetes, have been separated by CD-modified CZE, using uncoated fused-silica capillary. After screening 13 negatively charged CD derivatives as potential chiral selectors, sulfobutyl-ether-α-CD (SBE-α-CD) was selected for the enantioseparation. For the optimization, a factorial analysis study was performed by orthogonal experimental design. Six experimental factors were chosen as variable parameters: temperature, applied <b>voltage,</b> chiral <b>selector</b> and BGE concentrations, pH, and the parameters of the hydrodynamic injection. The optimized system still was not considered final as the second peak (S-enantiomer) migrated too close to the EOF, resulting in a potential inaccuracy during the determination of the chiral impurity. To fine-tune the method "one factor at a time" variation approach was applied. The final method (applying 15 °C capillary temperature, 40 mbar × 4 s hydrodynamic injection, 25 kV voltage in 75 mM acetate-Tris buffer [pH 4. 75] containing 20 mM SBE-α-CD as chiral selector) was validated according to the ICH guideline. RSD percentage of the resolution value, migration times, and corrected peak areas were below 5 % during testing repeatability and intermediate precision. LOD and LOQ values were found to be 2. 5 and 7. 5 μg/mL, respectively. The method is considered linear in the 7. 5 - 180 μg/mL range for the R-enantiomer. The robustness of the method was justified using Plackett-Burmann statistical experimental design. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. ...|$|R
40|$|Mass spectrometers and {{residual}} gas analyzers (RGA) {{are used in}} a variety of applications for analysis of volatile and semi-volatile materials. Analysis is performed by detecting fragments of gas molecules, based on their mass to charge ratio, which are generated in the mass spectrometer. When used as a detector for a gas chromatograph, they function as a means to quantitatively identify isolated volatile species which have been separated from other species via the gas chromatograph. Vacuum Technology, Inc., (VTI) produces a magnetic sector mass spectrometer/RGA which is used in many industrial and laboratory environments. In order to increase the utility of this instrument, it is desirable to increase the mass scanning speed, thereby increasing the number of applications for which it is suited. This project performed the following three upgrades on the computer interface. (1) A new electrometer was designed and built to process the signal from the detector. This new electrometer is more sensitive, over 10 times faster, and over 100 times more stable than the electrometer it will replace. (2) The controller EPROM was reprogrammed with new firmware. This firmware acts as an operating system for the interface and is used to shuttle communications between the PC and the AEROVAC mass spectrometer. (3) The voltage regulator which causes the ion <b>selector</b> <b>voltage</b> to ramp to allow ions of selected mass to be sequentially detected was redesigned and prototyped. The redesigned voltage regulator can be ramped up or down more than 100 times faster than the existing regulator. These changes were incorporated into a prototype unit and preliminary performance testing conducted. Results indicated that scanning speed was significantly increased over the unmodified version...|$|R
40|$|This Cooperative Research and Development Agreement {{was used}} to modify Vacuum Technology`s AERO VAC computer/mass {{spectrometer}} interface and electronics to allow the mass spectrometer to acquire rapid scans. The computer interface sends signals from the PC to the mass spectrometer, controlling its filament, giving scan instructions, and selecting the proper electrometer range, and detector. It then receives the detector output {{in the form of}} amplified digital signals from the electrometer. This project performed the following three upgrades on the computer interface and electronics. (1) A new electrometer was designed and built to process the signal from the detector. This new electrometer is more sensitive, over 10 times faster, and over 100 times more stable than the electrometer it will have replaced. (2) The controller EPROM was reprogrammed with new firmware. This firmware acts as an operating system for the interface and is used to shuttle communications between the PC and the AERO VAC mass spectrometer. The new firmware allows digital signals to be transmitted considerably faster to and from the mass spectrometer than the old firmware. The voltage regulator which causes the ion <b>selector</b> <b>voltage</b> to ramp to allow ions of selected mass to be sequentially detected was redesigned and prototyped. The redesign allowed obsolete electronics in the regulator circuitry to be replaced with more efficient circuitry. The redesigned voltage regulator can be ramped up or down more than 100 times faster than the existing regulator. Figure 4 shows a picture of the prototype voltage regulator circuit. These changes were incorporated into a prototype unit and preliminary performance testing conducted. Results indicated that scanning speed was significantly increased over the unmodified version...|$|R
50|$|An SMPS {{designed}} for AC input {{can usually be}} run from a DC supply, because the DC would pass through the rectifier unchanged. If the power supply is {{designed for}} 115 VAC and has no <b>voltage</b> <b>selector</b> switch, the required DC voltage would be 163 VDC (115 × √). This type of use may be harmful to the rectifier stage, however, as it will only use half of diodes in the rectifier for the full load. This could possibly result in overheating of these components, causing them to fail prematurely. On the other hand, if the power supply has a <b>voltage</b> <b>selector</b> switch, based on the Delon circuit, for 115/230V (computer ATX power supplies typically are in this category), the selector switch {{would have to be}} put in the 230 V position, and the required voltage would be 325 VDC (230 × √). The diodes in this type of power supply will handle the DC current just fine because they are rated to handle double the nominal input current when operated in the 115 V mode, due to the operation of the voltage doubler. This is because the doubler, when in operation, uses only half of the bridge rectifier and runs twice as much current through it. It is uncertain how an Auto-ranging/Active-PFC type power supply would react to being powered by DC.|$|E
50|$|Power {{supplies}} {{designed for}} worldwide use were {{equipped with an}} input <b>voltage</b> <b>selector</b> switch that allowed the user to configure the unit for use on local power grid. In the lower voltage range, around 115 V, this switch is turned on changing the power grid voltage rectifier into a voltage doubler in delon circuit design. As a result, the large primary filter capacitor behind that rectifier was split up into two capacitors wired in series, balanced with bleeder resistors and varistors that were necessary in the upper input voltage range, around 230 V. Connecting the unit configured for the lower range to a higher-voltage grid usually resulted in an immediate permanent damage. When the power factor correction (PFC) was required, those filter capacitors were replaced with higher-capacity ones, together with a coil installed in series to delay the inrush current. This is the simple design of a passive PFC.|$|E
50|$|If the SMPS has an AC input, {{then the}} first stage is to convert the input to DC. This is called rectification. A SMPS with a DC input does not require this stage. In some power {{supplies}} (mostly computer ATX power supplies), the rectifier circuit can be configured as a voltage doubler {{by the addition of}} a switch operated either manually or automatically. This feature permits operation from power sources that are normally at 115 V or at 230 V. The rectifier produces an unregulated DC voltage which is then sent to a large filter capacitor. The current drawn from the mains supply by this rectifier circuit occurs in short pulses around the AC voltage peaks. These pulses have significant high frequency energy which reduces the power factor. To correct for this, many newer SMPS will use a special PFC circuit to make the input current follow the sinusoidal shape of the AC input voltage, correcting the power factor. Power supplies that use active PFC usually are auto-ranging, supporting input voltages from ~100 VAC - 250 VAC, with no input <b>voltage</b> <b>selector</b> switch.|$|E
40|$|The memristor and {{selector}} {{devices are}} the most promising candidates in the research of emerging memory technologies and neuromorphic computing applications. To understand the device properties and guide for future applications, models for those devices based on physical mechanisms are essential. We developed models for two popular memristors and a selector. We developed a SPICE-compatible compact model of TiO 2 -TiO 2 -x memristors based on classic ion transportation theory. Our model is shown to simulate important dynamic memristive properties like real-time memristance switching, which are critical in memristor-based analog circuit designs. The model, {{as well as its}} analytical approximation, is validated with the experimentally obtained data from real devices. Minor deviations of our model from the measured data are also analyzed and discussed. We illustrate a heuristic two-state-variable memristor model of charged O vacancy drift resistive switches that includes the effects of internal Joule heating on both the electronic transport and the drift velocity (i. e. switching speed) of vacancies in the switching material. The dynamical state variables correspond to the cross-sectional area of a conducting channel in the device and the gap between the end of the channel and one of the electrodes. The model was calibrated against low voltage pulse-sweep and state-test data collected from a TaOx memristor so that the contributions of the channel gap, area and temperature to switching can be analyzed. The model agrees well with experimental results for long switching times and low-to-intermediate <b>voltage</b> operation. A <b>selector</b> device that demonstrates high nonlinearity, low switching voltage and volatility was fabricated using HfOx materials with Ag electrodes. The electronic conductance of such volatile selector device was studied under both static and dynamic conditions, with DC and AC measurements respectively. From experimental observations, a compact model is developed in this study to illustrate the physical process of the formation and dissipation of Ag filament for electron transport through the device. A dynamic capacitance model is used to fit the transient current traces under different voltage bias through the device and allow the extraction of parameters associated with the various parasitic components in the device...|$|R
