The J79 engine was not yet ready, so both prototypes were instead designed to use the Wright J65, a licensed built version of the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire. Construction of the first prototype XF-104 (US serial number 53-7786, Buzz number FG-786) began in summer 1953 at Lockheed's Burbank, California factory. This aircraft was powered by a non-afterburning Buick-built Wright J65-B-3 turbojet. The first prototype was completed by early 1954, and started flying in March. The total time from award of the contract to first flight was only one year, a <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> even then, and unheard of today, when 10–15 years is more typical.

Kaiser Barbarossa and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day, disembarked the landing force, and then proceeded to the North Sea, where they resumed guard ship duties.

40|$|In a suspension, the {{hydrodynamic}} {{interactions between}} particles can propagate by two mechanisms: relatively slowly, by {{the diffusion of}} transverse momentum, or relatively rapidly, by the propagation of sound waves. Here we describe computer simulation results for the collective and single particle dynamics of colloidal particles {{with the aim of}} clarifying the role of sound. We find that for single particle motion the effect is rather trivial. As for an isolated particle, compressibility modifies the decay of velocity fluctuations only at <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>times.</b> For collective correlations this is not true. Our results show that the multiple scattering of sound waves between particles can induce correlated collective motions on time scales comparable with the diffusion of transverse momentum. The effects of compressibility are no longer restricted to <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>times</b> and manifest themselves as rapid oscillations in the time dependence of the collective diffusion coefficient. We suggest that these oscillations can largely be explained in terms of “effective” incompressible hydrodynamic theory, the suspension bulk viscosity, kinematic viscosity, and speed of sound becoming the relevant parameters. The oscillations are furthermore centered on the (hypothetical) incompressible result. Thus, while the effects of sound propagation may extend to surprisingly long times, the net effect remains limited to <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>times.</b> We discuss where these sound-induced oscillations will be relevant experimentally.

5|$|In the {{beginning}} Reitz {{found it hard}} to make a living, as competition among lawyers in Cape Town was quite severe at this time. Nevertheless, he succeeded in making a name for himself, due to his sharp legal mind and his social intelligence. Being part of the western Circuit Court of the Cape Colony gave him a lot of experience in a <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>time.</b> At the same time, Reitz nurtured his political interests by writing lead articles for the Cape Argus newspaper, for which he also reported on the proceedings of the Cape Parliament and acted as deputy editor. In 1870 Reitz moved his legal practice to Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State. The discovery of diamonds {{on the banks of the}} Vaal River, Reitz thought, would lead to a growth of legal work and enable him to set up a thriving practice. This was not to be, however, and after a few months Reitz left Bloemfontein to set up as a diamond prospector in Griqualand West, where he bought a small claim near Pniel from the Berlin Missionary Society. This enterprise also proved unsuccessful, and again after only a few months Reitz returned to Cape Town. This time, his Cape Town law practice was successful, ironically because of the British annexation of the Orange Free State diamondfields (1871) and the economic prosperity this emanated for the Cape Colony.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the development, the game was intended to be released on the PlayStation 2. In May 2005, however, after the positive reception of the tech demo of Final Fantasy VII, the team decided to move the game to the PlayStation 3 and developed it with the new Crystal Tools engine, a seventh generation multiplatform game engine created by Square Enix for its next generation games. Square Enix believed that developing a new engine would speed up development time later in the project, though it would initially cause a delay in the game's development. However, the delay was longer than originally anticipated as the engine had to accommodate the requirements of several other games in addition to XIII. Another factor in the platform move was the delayed release of Final Fantasy XII, which came out a <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> before the release of the PlayStation 3. A PC port was considered during development, but was decided against due to how Square Enix saw the video game market situation at the time as well as additional complexities that Square Enix did not have experience with related to the PC platform, such as security issues. Final Fantasy XIII was first shown at the 2006 E3 convention. The trailer shown was an artistic concept that did not represent the final concept for the game, since at the time there was no playable form of the game. Announced alongside the game was Final Fantasy Versus XIII, later retitled as Final Fantasy XV, and the PlayStation Portable game Final Fantasy Type-0, originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, the three of which form the Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy series. Square Enix explained that although all three games are thematically linked, they are not directly related in terms of story.|$|E
