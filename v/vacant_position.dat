5|$|Honoring Davis's war service, Governor Brown of Mississippi {{appointed}} {{him to the}} <b>vacant</b> <b>position</b> of United States Senator Jesse Speight, a Democrat, who had died on May 1, 1847. Davis, also a Democrat, took his temporary seat on December 5, and in January 1848 he was elected by the state legislature to serve the remaining {{two years of the}} term. In December, during the 30th United States Congress, Davis was made a regent of the Smithsonian Institution and began serving on the Committee on Military Affairs and the Library Committee.|$|E
5|$|A year later, Catherine was {{banished from}} court, and her rooms {{were given to}} Anne. Anne was an unusually educated and {{intellectual}} woman for her time, and was keenly absorbed and engaged {{with the ideas of}} the Protestant Reformers, though the extent to which she herself was a committed Protestant is much debated. When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died, Anne's influence and the need to find a trustworthy supporter of the annulment had Thomas Cranmer appointed to the <b>vacant</b> <b>position.</b> This was approved by the Pope, unaware of the King's nascent plans for the Church.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Bruce won the Football League Championship Manager of the Month {{after leading}} Hull to four victories; Hernández, who scored six times, got the players' equivalent. Hull {{finished}} {{the season in}} fourth, qualifying for the play-offs, where they defeated Derby County in the semi-finals. In the final on 28 May, a 25-yard goal from Mohamed Diamé against Sheffield Wednesday won Hull promotion to the Premier League {{for the second time}} during Bruce's spell in charge. Bruce said after the game that he had considered resignation following the team's relegation, and would hold talks with the prospective new owners to be assured of his future. In July 2016, with his future at Hull seemingly still uncertain, he was interviewed by officials of The Football Association concerning the <b>vacant</b> <b>position</b> of manager of England. Three days later, Bruce met with Hull City officials and announced his resignation later that day amid claims he became frustrated by a lack of transfer activity at the club.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, Dormand {{had opposed}} left-wing {{infiltration}} into the Labour Party, and in foreign affairs, he was pro-American and pro-NATO {{at a time}} when the party's left-wing was becoming increasingly hostile to both. In October 1981, Dormand stood for the <b>vacant</b> <b>position</b> of Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, supported by the centre-Right Manifesto Group of Labour MPs. The strength of the left-wing in the Constituency Labour Parties at the time had spurred the Manifesto group to improve its organisation, and Dormand (nominated by former Prime Minister James Callaghan) defeated the main challenger, left-wing MP Ian Mikardo by 102 votes to 65, and Mikardo then withdrew. The other three candidates were Harry Ewing (22 votes), Willie Hamilton (11 votes) and Frank Hooley (11 votes) but all withdrew so no second ballot was held. Dormand held the chairmanship until he retired from the House of Commons in 1987.|$|E
5|$|James A. Seddon {{resigned}} {{his position}} as the Confederate Secretary of War on January 19, 1865. On February 6, Davis appointed Breckinridge to the <b>vacant</b> <b>position,</b> partially to quiet growing opposition to his administration. Initially opposed by {{several members of the}} Confederate Congress because he had waited to join the Confederacy, he eventually gained their support by administrating his office more efficiently than his predecessors. With their support, he was able to expand the post's influence to include making officer assignments and promotion recommendations and advising field generals regarding strategy. His first act as secretary was to promote Robert E. Lee to general-in-chief of all Confederate forces. After Lee reported a critical shortage of food, clothing, and supplies among his troops, Breckinridge recommended the removal of Lucius B. Northrop, the Confederate commissary general. Northrop's successor, Isaac M. St. John, improved the flow of supplies to troops in the field.|$|E
5|$|Southall {{applied for}} the <b>vacant</b> <b>position,</b> but Bobby Gould was chosen instead, who in turn named Southall and Ian Rush as his assistants. He tried Danny Coyne, Andy Marriott and Tony Roberts in goal in {{friendly}} games, but selected Southall for the World Cup qualifying wins over San Marino. A month away from his 39th birthday, he won his final cap against Turkey on 20 August 1997; the Turks won 6–4. Southall only played the first half as Gould blamed him for the three goals he conceded – his replacement Paul Jones went on to concede three himself in the second half. His 92 Welsh caps are a national record, he conceded 126 goals, {{for an average of}} 1.34 per match. The 1958 FIFA World Cup was the only time until {{the end of his career}} that Wales qualified for a major tournament and the British Home Championship was played for the final time in 1984, therefore the majority of Southall's caps came in friendlies or qualifying games.|$|E

40|$|This paper revisits {{manipulation}} via capacities in centralized two-sided matching markets. Sönmez (1997) {{showed that}} no stable mechanism is nonmanipulable via capacities. We show that non-manipulability via capacities can be equivalently described by {{two types of}} non-manipulation via capacities: non-Type-I-manipulability meaning that no college with <b>vacant</b> <b>positions</b> can manipulate by dropping some of its empty positions; and non-Type-II manipulability meaning that no college with no <b>vacant</b> <b>positions</b> can manipulate by dropping some of its filled positions. Our main result shows that the student-optimal stable mechanism is the unique stable mechanism which is non-Type-I-manipulable via capacities and independent of truncations. Our characterization supports {{the use of the}} student-optimal stable mechanism in these matching markets because of its limited manipulability via capacities by colleges.
