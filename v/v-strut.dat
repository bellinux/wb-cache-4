25|$|The Schwalbe had fixed, {{conventional}} landing gear, {{with its}} mainwheels on a split axle sprung by rubber cords to V-struts {{from the lower}} fuselage and stabilized centrally by a transverse <b>V-strut.</b> There was a short, steel tailskid.|$|E
25|$|The {{airframe}} {{was constructed}} largely of wood, with plywood covering the forward fuselage and a steel-tube <b>v-strut</b> chassis main undercarriage with two wheels and a tail-skid at the aft {{end of the}} fuselage. Two examples of the R.II had been completed {{by the time the}} Armistice bore the IdFlieg German military registration numbers R.55/17 and R.58/17.|$|E
25|$|The DP.VII's mainwheels were {{mounted on}} a single axle, {{conventionally}} rubber sprung to a cross member attached to the lower fuselage longerons by a V-form pair of struts on each side. Less conventionally, the undercarriage structure was braced by another, transverse, <b>V-strut</b> from the cross piece centre to the longerons. There was a sprung tail skid at the rear.|$|E
50|$|The Hy.479 {{could be}} easily {{configured}} as an amphibian, with mainwheels on <b>V-struts</b> hinged on extensions of the engine struts and inner <b>V-struts</b> braced to the lower hull. With the inner struts disconnected, the wheels could be raised outwards to the wing underside.|$|R
50|$|The D.14 had conventional, fixed landing gear. A pair of <b>V-struts,</b> splayed {{slightly}} outwards, {{were attached}} to the lower fuselage longerons and supported a rigid axle, with the mainwheels 2.50 m apart. The forward components of the <b>V-struts</b> were telescopic, with shock absorbers and coil springs inside their streamlined fairings.|$|R
50|$|Prototype design, with <b>V-struts</b> and a constant-chord wing. One built.|$|R
25|$|The RK.25 had a {{traditional}} fixed undercarriage with a track of , its mainwheels {{on a single}} axle supported {{by a pair of}} V-struts from the lower fuselage. The tops of the forward <b>V-strut</b> members were joined transversely by a beam, free to slide vertically between pairs of fuselage members but restrained by sets of rubber rings which also circled the wing structure as it crossed the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The E-34 had a {{rectangular}} cross-section fuselage formed from steel tubing with internal wire bracing. Its cockpits were open. The undercarriage used {{a pair of}} internally sprung mainwheels with balloon tyres and a tailskid. A split axle was mounted on a short <b>V-strut</b> below the fuselage. On the prototype, the undercarriage main legs were short, mounted on the lower fuselage longerons and assisted by short forward struts. The second prototype and production aircraft had longer legs fixed to the upper longerons. The prototype and production series aircraft were powered, as {{the rules of the}} competition required, by a 105hp (78kW) Walter Junior four-cylinder inverted inline engine, although the second prototype was fitted with the more powerful 130hp (97kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major of the same configuration.|$|E
25|$|The T.III's {{alternative}} undercarriages {{were both}} fixed, {{with the two}} legs independent of each, avoiding the cross bracing which would have interfered with the bomb or torpedo release. Each mainwheel was on a horizontal axle supported at the outer end by a longitudinal <b>V-strut</b> from the wing underside. There were two more pairs of Vs, one fixed below the wing {{and the other on}} the lower fuselage, angled towards each other to support the inner end of the axle. A tailskid completed the undercarriage. The T.III's twin float undercarriage projected just forward of the nose. The floats were mounted on the fuselage by two sets of N-struts, with diagonal transverse bracing between them, on each float. Both wood and aluminium floats were available. Fitting floats added 243kg (536lb) to the unladened weight and reduced the maximum speed by 11km/h (7mph).|$|E
50|$|Its fixed, {{conventional}} undercarriage {{originally had}} mainwheels {{on a single}} axle, mounted on <b>V-struts</b> from the lower fuselage with wire cross-bracing. The rear components of the <b>V-struts</b> had rubber disc shock absorbers. By May 1928 the axle had gone and the landing gear made more robust with a transverse X-strut. A castoring steel tailskid had its own rubber shock absorber.|$|R
50|$|The wing {{mounting}} was unusual, with airfoil section, N-form struts on {{each side}} connecting the wing spars not to the lower fuselage but instead to the frames that carried the independently rubber sprung undercarriage mainwheels. These frames, enclosed in streamlined fairings 2.50 m apart, were also braced the upper fuselage longerons with shorter N-struts and with inverted <b>V-struts</b> to the central fuselage underside. Short, inverted <b>V-struts</b> attached the wing centre section to the upper fuselage. There were no wing bracing wires.|$|R
50|$|It had a conventional, fixed, {{tailskid}} undercarriage. Under each engine {{there was}} a pair of mainwheels on a single axle mounted on two vertical <b>V-struts</b> from the nacelle.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a shoulder-wing monoplane {{powered by a}} 52kW (70hp) Gnome Gamma 7-cylinder rotary engine driving a two bladed propeller. The pilot and passenger were seated in side-by-side configuration: the control column was centrally mounted {{and there were two}} sets of rudder pedals, so that it could be flown from either seat. The shallow section rectangular fuselage tapered to a horizontal knife-edge at the tail, with the elongated triangular horizontal stabiliser mounted in the middle, its covering blending into that of the upper and lower fuselage surface. A semi-elliptical elevator was mounted on the trailing edge, and a triangular balanced rudder was mounted above the rear fuselage. Lateral control was effected by wing-warping, the wires leading to a single inverted <b>V-strut</b> cabane above the fuselage and a similar V strut beneath. Petrol was stored in three tanks: a pair of gravity tanks were located under the top decking in front of the cockpit, pressure-fed from a larger tank under the seats.|$|E
2500|$|The Types M and N had a {{tailskid}} undercarriage. [...] A transverse {{steel bar}} was fixed {{at each end}} to an ash <b>V-strut</b> from the lower fuselage and further braced with a steel <b>V-strut</b> from its centre. A pair of axles, hinged at {{the centre of the}} bar, passed through the vertices of the ash struts via rubber shock absorbers with the mainwheels, slightly toed out and [...] apart, beyond them. Early versions of the undercarriage used a single axle rather than a split one. There was an unusually long, curved, tall tailskid at the rear to keep the long tailplane clear of the ground.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the common}} {{configuration}} {{the wings of}} the D.XVI and D.XVII were different. The D.XVIIs wings had constant chord and overhung ailerons. [...] It was mounted over the fuselage on each side with an inverted V-form strut pair from the leading edge to the lower fuselage longeron and a second strut from the rear wing spar to the same longeron further aft. [...] The structure was stabilized laterally with a further outward leaning strut between top of the forward <b>V-strut</b> and the upper fuselage.|$|E
50|$|The C.43 had a fixed {{tailskid}} undercarriage. There were {{pairs of}} mainwheels mounted on single axles {{attached to a}} longitudinal bar held under the engine on short <b>V-struts.</b> To prevent nose-overs, there was a fifth wheel mounted under the nose. The wheels could be replaced by flat sided floats, each fixed to the fuselage by two pairs of inverted <b>V-struts,</b> one to {{each side of the}} float. Though in floatplane configuration the C.43 sat level over the water, the tailskid was joined by a small, cylindrical float to protect the tail at take-off.|$|R
2500|$|... shutter, {{close to}} the twin-bladed propeller. [...] The simple single axle {{undercarriage}} was mounted {{on a pair of}} inverted <b>V-struts</b> joining the fuselage ahead and aft of the lower wing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} aluminum sheet. Its 9.5 m span wing is supported by <b>V-struts</b> and jury struts. The standard engine available was the [...] Rotax 912UL four-stroke powerplant.|$|R
2500|$|To {{keep them}} {{clear of the}} spray of take-off, each of the Robbe's two [...] BMW IV {{water-cooled}} six cylinder upright inline engines was mounted in pusher configuration high above the wings on vertical faired steel tube N-form struts, the forward inner one particularly sturdy, and with transverse <b>V-strut</b> bracing with its apex on the central, upper fuselage. The engines were cooled with radiators {{in the front of}} the engine cowling and behind shutters controlled from the cockpit. There was a reserve fuel tank above each engine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is constructed}} with a welded 4130 steel tube fuselage and aluminium wings, built {{up from a}} D-cell on an I-beam spar. The aircraft is covered with painted aircraft fabric. The wing is braced by a <b>V-strut</b> with jury struts. The landing gear is of taildragger configuration, with bungee suspended main wheels and a sprung, steerable tailwheel. The aircraft has standard dual controls, adjustable left hand control stick, adjustable seats and a [...] wide cabin. Flaperons are optional and reduce the stall speed to [...] from [...]|$|E
2500|$|The plywood covered {{centre section}} of the low wing {{was part of the}} {{monocoque}} fuselage and the two spar outer panels were ply covered back to the rear spar. [...] The fuselage was a rounded monocoque with the engine in a streamlined nose, its cylinders exposed for cooling. Its single seat cockpit was set back towards the wing trailing edge. The G-8 had a fixed tail wheel undercarriage with its main wheels on cranked <b>V-strut</b> axles hinged to the centre of the fuselage underside. [...] Each wheel had a faired vertical shock absorber leg to the outer part of the centre section.|$|E
50|$|The biplane had {{conventional}} {{landing gear}} with each independently mounted mainwheel attached to faired <b>V-struts</b> and to a single long faired strut to the upper fuselage; {{there was a long}} tailskid.|$|R
5000|$|The Do S was {{powered by}} four [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Lbr {{water-cooled}} V-12 engines, mounted above the wings in push-pull configuration pairs and driving four-bladed propellers. Each engine {{in a pair}} had a radiator occupying half {{the front of the}} rectangular section nacelle. Each pair was mounted on two <b>V-struts</b> and two wider-spread inverted <b>V-struts</b> to the forward and central spars. The upper engine mountings were braced together centrally by a narrow-chord structure which acted as an auxiliary wing as well as being part of the main wing bracing structure. With a span of almost 9 m, it reached out beyond the engines.|$|R
50|$|The Peyret had fixed {{tailskid}} {{landing gear}} with its mainwheels and associated bungee shock absorbers on a single, steel tube axle mounted on <b>V-struts,</b> wire cross-braced to each other, {{from the lower}} longerons.|$|R
2500|$|It was {{powered by}} a Pobjoy R seven-cylinder radial engine; the two-blade {{propeller}} was driven via spur gears that reduced its speed and placed the output shaft above the engine centre, an unusual arrangement for a radial. [...] The cabin was under the wing with a deep starboard-side access door and multi-panel glazing. The fuselage tapered aft, with the tailplane set halfway up it, and its fin and rudder together were almost triangular apart from a rounded tip. The Multipro's conventional undercarriage was fixed, with the mainwheels on V-struts attached to the lower longerons and stabilized laterally by an inverted <b>V-strut</b> jointed at the fuselage central underside.|$|E
2500|$|The Jacobs plans {{show the}} Hols der Teufel had a simple, {{constant}} chord wing {{much like that}} of the Zögling though of greater span, built around two spars and fabric covered except at the leading edge which was plywood skinned. [...] Its broad, constant chord ailerons were longer than those of the Zögling and its round cornered, tapered tips were less angular. [...] As before, the wing was supported by the forward members of its girder fuselage; a vertical strut near the leading edge and an inverted <b>V-strut</b> behind. [...] As the wing was strut rather than wire braced there was no longer a need to extend these struts above the wing into a pylon. [...] The two faired, parallel lift struts on each side ran from the lower forward fuselage to the wing at about mid-span.|$|E
2500|$|Each wing was braced from {{a single}} point on the lower {{fuselage}} pod longeron to nose and rear spars at about 40% span by an faired <b>V-strut.</b> [...] There were a pair of sturdy, faired, vertical struts between the upper pod and the wing centre. The pod was flat sided, with angled upper and lower surfaces and on the Storch IV projected back almost to a line between the aileron trailing edges to provide some yaw stability. On the Storch V this provided a place to mount a small DKW [...] air-cooled two-stroke engine in pusher configuration with its output shaft just lower than the wing. [...] Enclosed within a humped, metal cowling, it proved difficult to cool, so it was generally run at less than full power. [...] There was a landing skid under the pod which extended back past {{the end of the}} pod to protect the propeller.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} aluminum sheet. Its 10.0 m span wing is supported by <b>V-struts</b> and jury struts. Standard engines available were the [...] Rotax 912ULS four-stroke and a [...] Continental Motors, Inc. four-stroke powerplant.|$|R
2500|$|The Nieuport 15 was a twin bay un-staggered wing sequiplane with <b>V-struts</b> and a newly {{designed}} tailplane including heart shaped elevators. It was {{powered by a}} [...] Renault 12F V-12 engine. [...] featuring Hazet vertical tube radiators.|$|R
2500|$|The Feiro I had a {{tailskid}} undercarriage with mainwheels [...] {{apart and}} rubber sprung {{on a single}} axle, its ends supported by longitudinal <b>V-struts</b> and positioned laterally by a steel V-strut; all struts were from the lower fuselage longerons.|$|R
2500|$|The PVT was {{powered by}} a 420hp (313kW) 7-{{cylinder}} radial Gnome-Rhône 7K radial engine, housed with its cylinder heads exposed and driving a two-bladed propeller. [...] The fixed, divided type undercarriage had on each side a main shock absorber leg, its upper end attached to a steel pyramid protruding from the mid-fuselage keeping the leg closer to the vertical whilst providing a wide track. [...] Each wheel {{was connected to the}} lower fuselage with a swinging <b>V-strut.</b> [...] A simple tail skid completed the undercarriage. The horizontal tail and fixed fin were both canvas covered wooden structures, though the moving surfaces, also canvas covered, had metal frames. [...] The tailplane was strut braced to the fuselage from below and wire braced above to the fin. [...] It carried elevators which were spade assisted like the ailerons but also horn balanced. [...] The unbalanced rudder was broad and rounded.|$|E
2500|$|The wings {{were built}} around two spars. The central 25% of their span, between the booms, had {{constant}} chord. [...] Immediately outboard {{they had a}} wider chord and beyond were double straight tapered to rounded tips. They carried [...] almost full span, narrow chord Frise ailerons. Forward, the slim, square section and untapered tail booms blended into the wings at about mid-chord, the aft ends carrying a constant chord tailplane slightly above them. [...] This had rounded tips and a central elevator with a trim tab. [...] A central, single, tall, round tipped, wire braced vertical tail was mounted on in it. The H.110 had a fixed, split, conventional undercarriage with each spatted mainwheel on a faired, near vertical shock absorber and a rearward leaning strut together forming a V, laterally braced with an inverted <b>V-strut</b> attached near the under fuselage centre line. [...] There was a central tailwheel on a long leg under the fin.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{aircraft}} were two-bay tractor biplanes with low-dihedral parallel-chord unstaggered wings with rounded ends, using wing warping for roll control. The fuselage was {{a rectangular}} section fabric-covered [...] wire-braced structure, {{within which the}} pilot occupied the aft cockpit behind the wings and the observer the forward cockpit, this arrangement being adopted so that the aircraft could be flown without a passenger without affecting the aircraft's centre of gravity. Behind the pilot a curved top decking extended aft to the tail. The tail surfaces consisted of a half-oval horizontal stabiliser with a split elevator mounted above the upper longerons and an ovoid rudder hinged to the sternpost. There was no fixed vertical fin. The main undercarriage consisted {{of a pair of}} skids each carried on an inverted <b>V-strut</b> at their rear and a single raked strut at the front: an axle carrying the wheels was bound to the skids by bungee cords and restrained by radius rods. A sprung tailskid was fitted and the wings were protected by semicircular skids beneath the lower wings.|$|E
50|$|<b>V-struts</b> {{converge}} from separate attachment {{points on}} upper wing {{to a single}} point on the lower wing. They are often used for the sesquiplane wing, in which the lower wing has a considerably smaller chord than the upper wing.|$|R
25|$|Developed by Marcel de Bruyere, the C1 was a single-bay biplane with {{staggered}} equal-span {{wings and}} inverted <b>V-struts.</b> An all-moving one piece canard controlled pitch, while roll control {{was provided by}} unusual full chord tip ailerons on the upper wing.|$|R
50|$|The CAP 1 had a conventional, fixed {{tailskid}} undercarriage, {{with independent}} pairs of mainwheels below the engines; each pair was mounted on {{two sets of}} <b>V-struts,</b> one vertical to the engine-bearing frame {{and the other to}} the lower fuselage longeron.|$|R
