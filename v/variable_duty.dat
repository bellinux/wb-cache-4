40|$|The {{classical}} {{approach to}} machinery fault detection {{is one where}} a machinery’s condition is constantly compared to an established baseline with deviations indicating the occurrence of a fault. With {{the absence of a}} well-established baseline, fault detection for <b>variable</b> <b>duty</b> machinery requires the use of complex machine learning and signal processing tools. These tools require extensive data collection and expert knowledge which limits their use for industrial applications. The thesis at hand investigates the problem of fault detection for a specific class of <b>variable</b> <b>duty</b> machinery; parallel machines with simultaneously loaded subsystems. As an industrial case study, the parallel drive stations of a novel material haulage system have been instrumented to confirm the mechanical response similarity between simultaneously loaded machines. Using a table-top fault simulator, a preliminary statistical algorithm was then developed for fault detection in bearings under non-stationary operation. Unlike other state of the art fault detection techniques used in monitoring <b>variable</b> <b>duty</b> machinery, the proposed algorithm avoided the need for complex machine learning tools and required no previous training. The limitations of the initial experimental setup necessitated {{the development of a new}} machinery fault simulator to expand the investigation to include transmission systems. The design, manufacturing and setup of the various subsystems within the new simulator are covered in this manuscript including the mechanical, hydraulic and control subsystems. To ensure that the new simulator has successfully met its design objectives, extensive data collection and analysis has been completed and is presented in this thesis. The results confirmed that the developed machine truly represents the operation of a simultaneously loaded machine and as such would serve as a research tool for investigating the application of classical fault detection techniques to parallel machines in non-stationary operation.

The observed objects include a complete X-ray flux limited sample drawn from the EMS Survey. The majority of the XSBLs classi- fied solely on the appearance of their spectra {{are members of the}} class of BL Lacs since they possess intrinsically polarized and <b>variable</b> continua. The <b>duty</b> cycle of polarized emission from XSBLs is 40 %. The majority of XSBLs (≈ 85 %) have preferred polarization position angles on time scales as long as three years. This reflects stability in the geometry of the region emitting the polarized optical emission. We discuss the observed spectral dependence of the degree of polarization and some of the possible mechanisms for producing the observed characteristics. While dilution of the polarized emission by the host galaxy starlight is present in some objects, we demon- strate that the average polarization properties derived from our observations are not drastically affected by this effect.

40|$|The {{development}} of edible films and coatings {{has been considered}} for their capability to improve quality and safety in fresh food. Natural abundant biodegradable polymeric materials such as cellulose derivatives (including methyl cellulose (MC) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)) chitosan, gums, starches or proteins are convenient for films and coatings production, due to lower environmental consequences compared with common synthetic plastic materials. The properties of edible films and coatings can be improved by combining the characteristics of hydrocolloids. Furthermore, incorporation of natural polyphenolic extract with bio-active properties in these blend solutions and composite films can enhance their active properties such as antioxidant and UV-barrier properties. However, the {{physical and chemical properties}} of edible films and coatings could also be modified when polyphenol-rich extracts are added. In these work, the ultrasound assisted-extraction was optimized and compared with conventional extraction of phenolic compounds from murtilla (Ugni molinae Turcz) leaves (Chapter 3). Then, the influence of polyphenol-rich extract from murtilla leaves on rheological properties of six blends of hydrocolloids based solutions were analyzed (Chapter 4). In addition, resulting films were analyzed in terms of FT-IR spectra, mechanical properties of the films, and film morphology (Chapter 5). The natural source of polyphenols that should be used in edible coatings based on hydrocolloid blends was selected in previous studies. We analyzed inhibition of the copper-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbic acid, as well as scavenging capacity of DPPH. and ABTS. + free radical of six natural aqueous extracts. The best antioxidant capacity was for murtilla leaves, which showed the lowest concentration of aqueous extract required for 50 % reduction of DPPH. and ABTS. + free radicals, and the greatest total phenolic compound concentration (P < 0. 05). Murta or murtilla is an endemic shrub found in central- southern Chile. Phenolic acids as gallic acid as well as flavonoids aglycones and glycosides of quercetin, myricetin and kaempferol are among the main compounds found in murtilla leaf extract. Ultrasound-assisted extraction allows a higher recovery of phenolic compounds from murtilla leaves than conventional maceration. In addition, the operating cost of ultrasound process in the determined optimal conditions is more efficient and has higher performance than extraction by maceration. The efficiency of the phenolic compounds recovery by ultrasound-assisted extraction depends on the effect of parameter interaction, exposure time/amplitude, as well as of independent <b>variables,</b> <b>duty</b> cycle and time. In this investigation, a viscosity between 3 and 11 Pa s at 25 °C proved to be adequate for spreading the film-forming solutions and form the film, which also is reflected in a thickness homogeneous film. The polyphenol-rich extract from murtilla leaf reduced viscosity of filmforming solutions based on CMC and CMC-starch, being their viscosity ranges, with and without extract, suitable for coatings and films production. Solutions based on gelatines of high and low molecular weight leave both an unstable rheological behavior when blended with polyphenolic compounds, due to pH reduction and consequently polyphenol/protein interaction form aggregates. When incorporating murtilla extract in chitosan and chitosan-starch solutions, the formation and detachment of 0. 5 1. 5 cm long brown aggregates were observed. These brown aggregates could be produced by strong hydrophobic interaction of chitosan chains as well as chitosan polyphenols interaction. In addition, sol gel transition occurred when extract from murtilla leaves was added to chitosan and chitosan-starch solutions, increasing strongly their viscosity and elasticity. However, viscosity of chitosan solution with murtilla leaf extract at 100 s- 1 shear rate (7. 11 Pa×s) and chitosan-starch solution with murtilla leaf extract at 50 s- 1 shear rate (5. 86 Pa×s) is suitable for casting process. Chitosan-starch solution with murtilla leaf extract form a more continuous and homogeneous film structure than the solution based on chitosan with murtilla leaf extract, due to corn starch stabilized the interaction between chitosan and murtilla leaf extract. Moreover, the extract increased thickness and yellow color of these films and reduced considerably the polymer chain mobility and, consequently, the flexibility and force of the films. The interaction mechanism of polyphenol-rich extract from murtilla leaves with chitosan chains inside the films is due to electrostatic interactions (ionic complexations under acidic conditions, pH: 4. 5), ester linkages and hydrogen bonds, whereas interaction of polyphenols from extract with starch chains is due to hydrogel bonds and ester linkages. All these results indicate that the incorporation of murtilla leaf extract modifies the physical and chemical properties of edible coatings and film-forming solutions. Depending of the product on which this film-forming solution will be applied, these modifications increase the shelf life of the product...|$|R

40|$|Synopsis Animals must {{continually}} respond dynamically as {{they move}} through complex environments, and slopes are a common terrain on which legged animals must move. Despite this, non-level locomotion remains poorly understood. In this study, we first review the literature on locomotor mechanics, metabolic cost, and kinematic strategies on slopes. Using existing literature we then performed scaling analyses of kinematic <b>variables,</b> including speed, <b>duty</b> factor, and stride-length {{across a range of}} body sizes from ants to horses. The studies that examined locomotion on inclines vastly outnumbered those focusing on declines. On inclines, animals tend to reduce speed and increase duty factor, but a similar consensus {{could not be reached for}} declines. Remarkably, stride-length did not differ between locomotion on inclines and on level terrain, but this may have resulted from data only being available for low slopes (5308). On declines there appears to be a shift in locomotor strategy that is size-dependent. At masses 51 – 10 kg, animals tended to use shorter strides than on level terrain, and the opposite occurred at larger body masses. Therefore, possibly due to stability issues, body mass plays a significant role in the locomotor strategy used when traveling downhill. Although we currently lack sufficient data, differential leg function is likely to be critical for locomotion on slopes, with mechanical demands differing on limbs during movement on level, inclined, and declined surfaces. Our scaling analysis not only highlights areas that require future work, but also suggests that body size is important for determining the mechanics and strategies animals use to negotiate non-level terrain. It is clear that selection has resulted in an incredible range of body size amon...|$|R
