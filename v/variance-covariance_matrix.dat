[...] The Gaussian copula is lacking as it only allows for an elliptical dependence structure, as dependence is only modeled using the <b>variance-covariance</b> <b>matrix.</b> [...] This methodology is limited such that it does not allow for dependence to evolve as the financial markets exhibit asymmetric dependence, whereby correlations across assets significantly increase during downturns compared to upturns. [...] Therefore, modeling approaches using the Gaussian copula exhibit a poor representation of extreme events. There have been attempts to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The modern space missions, e. g. ERS, SPOT, and the FORMOSAT etc., {{have offered}} {{a number of}} data and images for Earth’s {{resource}} exploration and environment monitoring. Recently, the Gravity-field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite mission provides highly precise gradiometric measurement data for recovery of Earth’s gravity field from space. When using the gravity gradients (the second derivatives of the gravitational potential) for prediction and filtering by stochastic processes like the Kolmogorov-Wiener or Gauss-Markov method, we have to first give the fourth-order variance-covariance/correlation matrices of the gravity gradient signals. For the consistency, this paper aims at {{the development of the}} fourth-order <b>variance-covariance</b> <b>matrices</b> by the famous Taylor-Kármán structured tensor. The variance-covariance Tensors developed here can be as prior information for fitting the discrete data from observations.

For each series of tests, they first use the VAR (vector autoregression) model in equations (1) through (3) to estimate the <b>variance-covariance</b> <b>matrices</b> for each pair of countries during the stable period, turmoil period, and full period.

2500|$|More fundamentally, {{investors are}} stuck with {{estimating}} key parameters from past market data because MPT attempts to model risk {{in terms of}} the likelihood of losses, but says nothing about why those losses might occur. The risk measurements used are probabilistic in nature, not structural. [...] This is a major difference as compared to many engineering approaches to risk management. As estimation errors are critical in MPT, appropriate modeling approaches must be applied. In an MPT or mean-variance optimization framework, accurate estimation of the <b>variance–covariance</b> <b>matrix</b> is paramount. [...] Thus, forecasting with Monte-Carlo simulation with the Gaussian copula and well-specified marginal distributions are effective. [...] Allowing the modeling process to allow for empirical characteristics in stock returns such as auto-regression, asymmetric volatility, skewness, and kurtosis is important. [...] Not accounting for these attributes can lead to severe estimation error in the correlation and variance–covariance matrices that have negative biases (as much as 70% of the true values).|$|E
