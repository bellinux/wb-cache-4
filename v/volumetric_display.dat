25|$|Holoxica has successfuly {{demonstrated}} {{several generations}} of holographic video displays. The technical approach advocates a simplified approach by starting with basic building blocks and scaling towards higher resolution and performance. The first-generation holographic display demonstrator, built in 2010, had up to nine voxels and could show simple numeric information, icons, symbology etc. This technology {{can be used to}} build segmented 3D displays, similar to the early segmented LCDs found in calculators and clocks. The second-generation display was announced in 2013. This is a planar Head-Up Display (HUD) with hundreds of thousands voxels and freeform images floating in mid-air that can change in real time. Interactivity is added with a Kinect motion sensor that allows you to 'touch' icons in free space and 'draw' in mid-air. The third generation display builds upon the previous generations to create a <b>volumetric</b> <b>display.</b> The images are bright and visible under indoor lighting conditions, and the approach is scalable, leveraging existing manufacturing techniques and components.|$|E

50|$|Known <b>volumetric</b> <b>display</b> {{technologies}} {{also have}} several drawbacks that are exhibited depending on trade-offs {{chosen by the}} system designer.|$|E
50|$|Most {{holograms}} produced are {{of static}} objects but systems for displaying changing scenes on a holographic <b>volumetric</b> <b>display</b> {{are now being}} developed.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{software}} platforms exist which deliver {{native and}} legacy 2D and 3D content to <b>volumetric</b> <b>displays.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{intent was to}} combine holography with music, and finally <b>volumetric</b> <b>displays</b> were settled on as an artistic medium. Many traditional film and video special effects have been adapted to hologlyphic movies, plus many more special effects unique to <b>volumetric</b> <b>displays</b> have been developed. These include volumetric wipe effects, raster bending, morphing, kaleidoscope and mirroring effects, experimental rotations, spatial warping effects and image sequencing.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{experiment}} that compares <b>volumetric</b> <b>displays</b> to existing 3 D display techniques in three tasks that require users to perceive depth in 3 D scenes. Because they generate imagery in true 3 D space, <b>volumetric</b> <b>displays</b> allow viewers {{to use their}} natural physiological mechanisms for depth perception, without requiring special hardware such as head trackers or shutter glasses. However, it is unclear from the literature as to whether these displays are actually better than the status-quo for enabling the perception of 3 D scenes, thus motivating the present study. Our results show that <b>volumetric</b> <b>displays</b> enable significantly better user performance in a simple depth judgment task, and better performance in a collision judgment task, but {{in its current form}} does not enhance user comprehension of more complex 3 D scenes...|$|R
50|$|The University of Bristol has {{developed}} a method for haptic feedback that could be integrated into a <b>volumetric</b> <b>display.</b> The system uses focused ultrasound to create a haptic objet in mid air.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of other autostereo systems as well, such as <b>volumetric</b> <b>display,</b> in which the reconstructed light field {{occupies}} a true volume of space, and integral imaging, which uses a fly's-eye lens array.|$|E
50|$|A <b>volumetric</b> <b>display</b> {{device is}} a {{graphic display device}} that forms a visual {{representation}} of an object in three physical dimensions, {{as opposed to the}} planar image of traditional screens that simulate depth through a number of different visual effects. One definition offered by pioneers in the field is that volumetric displays create 3D imagery via the emission, scattering, or relaying of illumination from well-defined regions in (x,y,z) space. Though there is no consensus among researchers in the field, it may be reasonable to admit holographic and highly multiview displays to the <b>volumetric</b> <b>display</b> family if they do a reasonable job of projecting a three-dimensional light field within a volume.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is often}} claimed that <b>volumetric</b> <b>displays</b> are {{incapable}} of reconstructing scenes with viewer-position-dependent effects, such as occlusion and opacity. This is a misconception; a display whose voxels have non-isotropic radiation profiles are indeed able to depict position-dependent effects. To-date, occlusion-capable <b>volumetric</b> <b>displays</b> require two conditions: (1) the imagery is rendered and projected {{as a series of}} [...] "views," [...] rather than [...] "slices," [...] and (2) the time-varying image surface is not a uniform diffuser. For example, researchers have demonstrated spinning-screen <b>volumetric</b> <b>displays</b> with reflective and/or vertically diffuse screens whose imagery exhibits occlusion and opacity. One system created HPO 3D imagery with a 360-degree field of view by oblique projection onto a vertical diffuser; another projects 24 views onto a rotating controlled-diffusion surface; and another provides 12-view images utilizing a vertically oriented louver.|$|R
40|$|Autostereoscopic {{displays}} {{present a}} three-dimensional image to a viewer {{without the need}} for glasses or other encumbering viewing aids. Three classes of autostereoscopic displays are described: reimaging <b>displays,</b> <b>volumetric</b> <b>displays,</b> and parallax displays. Reimaging displays reproject an existing three-dimensional object to a new location or depth. <b>Volumetric</b> <b>displays</b> illuminate points in a spatial volume. Parallax displays emit directionally-varying image information into the viewing zone. Parallax displays are the most common autostereoscopic displays and are most compatible with computer graphics. Different display technologies of the three types are described. Computer graphics techniques useful for three-dimensional image generation are outlined...|$|R
5000|$|Effects {{produced}} by lenticular printing, the Pepper's Ghost illusion (or modern variants {{such as the}} Musion Eyeliner), tomography and <b>volumetric</b> <b>displays</b> are often confused with holograms. Such illusions have been called [...] "fauxlography".|$|R
50|$|Recent {{advances}} {{have focused on}} non-tangible (free-space) implementations of the static-volume category, which might eventually allow direct interaction with the display. For instance, a fog display using multiple projectors can render a 3D image in a volume of space, resulting in a static-volume <b>volumetric</b> <b>display.</b>|$|E
50|$|Various other display {{techniques}} have been described, such as holography, <b>volumetric</b> <b>display,</b> and the Pulfrich effect; {{which was used}} in Doctor Who Dimensions in Time, in 1993, by 3rd Rock From The Sun in 1997, and by the Discovery Channel's Shark Week in 2000.|$|E

50|$|Voxels are {{frequently}} {{used in the}} visualization and analysis of medical and scientific data. Some <b>volumetric</b> <b>displays</b> use voxels to describe their resolution. For example, a display {{might be able to}} show 512×512×512 voxels.|$|R
40|$|<b>Volumetric</b> <b>displays</b> {{possess a}} number of unique {{properties}} which potentially make them particularly suitable for collaborative 3 D applications. Because such displays have only recently become available, interaction techniques for collaborative usage {{have yet to be}} explored. In this paper, we initiate this exploration. We present a prototype collaborative 3 D model viewing application, which served as a platform for our explorations. We outline three design goals, discuss the key interaction issues which were encountered, and describe a suite of new techniques in detail. In initial user observation sessions, we found that our techniques allowed users to successfully complete a variety of 3 D tasks. Furthermore, interviews with experts in potential usage domains indicated that the techniques we developed can serve as a baseline for future collaborative applications for <b>volumetric</b> <b>displays...</b>|$|R

5000|$|One other {{consideration}} {{is the very}} large amount of bandwidth required to feed imagery to a <b>volumetric</b> <b>display.</b> For example, a standard 24 bits per pixel, 1024×768 resolution, flat/2D display requires about 135 MB/s {{to be sent to}} the display hardware to sustain 60 frames per second, whereas a 24 bits per voxel, 1024×768×1024 (1024 [...] "pixel layers" [...] in the Z axis) <b>volumetric</b> <b>display</b> would need to send about three orders of magnitude more (135 GB/s) to the display hardware to sustain 60 volumes per second. As with regular 2D video, one could reduce the bandwidth needed by simply sending fewer volumes per second and letting the display hardware repeat frames in the interim, or by sending only enough data to affect those areas of the display that need to be updated, {{as is the case in}} modern lossy-compression video formats such as MPEG. Furthermore, a 3D <b>volumetric</b> <b>display</b> would require two to three orders of magnitude more CPU and/or GPU power beyond that necessary for 2D imagery of equivalent quality, due at least in part to the sheer amount of data that must be created and sent to the display hardware. However, if only the outer surface of the volume is visible, the number of voxels required would be of the same order as the number of pixels on a conventional display. This would only be the case if the voxels do not have [...] "alpha" [...] or transparency values.|$|E
50|$|This is {{probably}} the most 'direct' form of <b>volumetric</b> <b>display.</b> In the simplest case, an addressable volume of space is created out of active elements that are transparent in the off state but are either opaque or luminous in the on state. When the elements (called voxels) are activated, they show a solid pattern within the space of the display.|$|E
50|$|Although first {{postulated}} in 1912, and {{a staple}} of science fiction, <b>volumetric</b> <b>displays</b> are still under development, and have yet to reach the general population. With a variety of systems proposed and in use in small quantities—mostly in academia and various research labs—volumetric displays remain accessible only to academics, corporations, and the military.|$|R

To fully leverage their capabilities, appropriate user interfaces and interaction techniques must be designed. In this paper, we explore 3 D selection techniques for <b>volumetric</b> <b>displays.</b> In a first experiment, we find a ray cursor to be superior to a 3 D point cursor in a single target environment. To address the difficulties associated with dense target environments we design four new ray cursor techniques which provide disambiguation mechanisms for multiple intersected targets. Our techniques showed varied success in a second, dense target experiment. One of the new techniques, the depth ray, performed particularly well, significantly reducing movement time, error rate, and input device footprint {{in comparison to the}} 3 D point cursor...|$|R

50|$|A Volumetric Haptic Display (VHD) {{is similar}} to a (visual) <b>Volumetric</b> <b>Display,</b> but informs touch instead of vision. A VHD {{projects}} a touch-based representation of a surface onto a 3D volumetric space. Users can feel the projected surface(s), usually with their hands. The display is otherwise not detectable, and offers no visual feedback. There are no known instances of a fully operational VHD at this time.|$|E
