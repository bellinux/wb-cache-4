25|$|The EMH was {{developed}} by Professor Eugene Fama who argued that stocks always trade at their fair value, {{making it impossible for}} investors to either purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks for inflated prices. As such, it should be impossible to outperform the overall market through expert stock selection or market timing, and that the only way an investor can possibly obtain higher returns is by chance or by purchasing riskier investments. His 2012 study with Kenneth French confirmed this view, showing that the distribution of abnormal returns of US mutual funds is <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> would be expected if no fund managers had any skill—a necessary condition for the EMH to hold.|$|E
25|$|Referred {{pain can}} be {{indicative}} of nerve damage. A case study done on a 63-year-old man with a sustained injury during his childhood developed referred pain symptoms after his face or back was touched. After even a light touch, there was shooting pain in his arm. The study concluded {{that the reason for}} this man's pain was possibly due to a neural reorganization which sensitized regions of his face and back after the nerve damage occurred. It is mentioned that this case is <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> phantom limb syndrome patients suffer. This conclusion was based on experimental evidence gathered by V. Ramachandran in 1993, with the difference being that the arm that is in pain is still attached to the body.|$|E

[...] Development of WE.177A was delayed by several years due to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE) at Aldermaston being inundated with work on other warhead developments. AWRE workload eased after completion of the Polaris missile warheads and work was able to resume on the WE.177A, deliveries to the RAF beginning in late 1971 for deployment on Buccaneers of RAF Germany, a year after WE.177A deliveries to the Royal Navy. Approval for high-yield tactical weapons was eventually gained in 1970 and, by 1975, the RAF had WE.177C, which at almost 200 kt was a weapon <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> they had planned for the TSR-2 in 1959.|$|E

2500|$|In 1703 Georg Ernst Stahl, {{professor}} of medicine and chemistry at Halle, proposed a variant of the theory in which he renamed Becher's terra pinguis to phlogiston, and it was in this form that the theory probably had its greatest influence. The term phlogiston itself was not something that Stahl invented. There is evidence that the word was used as early as 1606, and {{in a way that was}} <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> Stahl was using it for. The term was derived from a Greek word meaning to inflame. The following paragraph describes Stahl's view of phlogiston well:To Stahl, metals were compounds containing phlogiston in combination with metallic oxides (calces); on ignition the phlogiston was freed from the metal leaving the oxide behind. When the oxide was heated with a substance rich in phlogiston, such as charcoal, the calx again took up phlogiston and regenerated the metal. Phlogiston was a definite substance, the same in all its combinations.Stahl's first definition of phlogiston first appeared in his [...] "Zymotechnia fundamentalis", published in 1697. His most quoted definition was found in the treatise on chemistry entitled [...] "Fundamenta chymiae" [...] in 1723. According to Stahl, phlogiston was a substance that was not able to be put into a bottle, but could be transferred nonetheless. To him, wood was just a combination of ash and phlogiston, and making a metal was as simple as getting a metal calx and adding phlogiston. Soot was almost pure phlogiston, which is why heating it with a metallic calx transforms the calx into the metal and Stahl attempted to prove that the phlogiston in soot and sulphur were identical by converting sulphates to liver of sulphur using charcoal. He did not account for the increase in weight on combustion of tin and lead that were known at the time.|$|E
40|$|Social {{capital is}} {{generally}} {{interpreted as the}} degree of trust, co-operative norms and networks and associations within a society. Economists have become increasingly interested in social capital, following the seminal work of Coleman (1988) and Putnam (1993). Since the publication of these studies a vast quantity of research on social capital has been published by economists, as well as researchers from other academic disciplines. This paper argues {{that in terms of}} its definition, and the arguments advanced as to why social capital is likely to affect economic performance, social capital is a <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> concept <b>to</b> <b>what</b> North (1990) defined as informal institutions.

Due to a ruling gradient on the line, the Wirksworth to Duffield section is protected by a trap-point just north of Wirksworth Station. The Wirksworth to Duffield token may change in the future as a passing loop has been installed at Shottle, to allow future two train running.

60|$|An {{adventure}} <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is here stated actually befell {{the late}} Mr. Abercromby of Tullibody, grandfather {{of the present}} Lord Abercromby, and father of the celebrated Sir Ralph. When this gentleman, who lived to a very advanced period of life, first settled in Stirlingshire, his cattle were repeatedly driven off by the celebrated Rob Roy, or some of his gang; and at length he was obliged, after obtaining a proper safe-conduct, to make the cateran such a visit as that of Waverley to Bean Lean in the text. Rob received him with much courtesy, and made many apologies for the accident, which must have happened, he said, through some mistake. Mr. Abercromby was regaled with collops from two of his own cattle, which were hung up by the heels in the cavern, and was dismissed in perfect safety, after having agreed to pay in future a small sum of black-mail, in consideration of which Rob Roy not only undertook to forbear his herds in future, but to replace any that should be stolen from him by other freebooters. Mr. Abercromby said Rob Roy affected to consider him as a friend to the Jacobite interest and a sincere enemy to the Union. Neither of these circumstances were true; but the laird thought it quite unnecessary to undeceive his Highland host {{at the risk of}} bringing on a political dispute in such a situation. This anecdote I received many years since (about 1792) {{from the mouth of the}} venerable gentleman who was concerned in it.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have already}} hinted {{that it is}} not our purpose to trace down the history of the Pyncheon family, in its {{unbroken}} connection with the House of the Seven Gables; nor to show, as in a magic picture, how the rustiness and infirmity of age gathered over the venerable house itself. As regards its interior life, a large, dim looking-glass used to hang in one of the rooms, and was fabled to contain within its depths all the shapes that had ever been reflected there,--the old Colonel himself, and his many descendants, some in the garb of antique babyhood, and others in the bloom of feminine beauty or manly prime, or saddened with the wrinkles of frosty age. Had we the secret of that mirror, we would gladly sit down before it, and transfer its revelations to our page. But there was a story, for which it is difficult to conceive any foundation, that the posterity of Matthew Maule had some connection with the mystery of the looking-glass, and that, by what {{appears to have been a}} sort of mesmeric process, they could make its inner region all alive with the departed Pyncheons; not as they had shown themselves to the world, nor in their better and happier hours, but as doing over again some deed of sin, or in the crisis of life's bitterest sorrow. The popular imagination, indeed, long kept itself busy with the affair of the old Puritan Pyncheon and the wizard Maule; the curse which the latter flung from his scaffold was remembered, with the very important addition, that it had become a part of the Pyncheon inheritance. If one of the family did but gurgle in his throat, a bystander would be likely enough to whisper, between jest and earnest, [...] "He has Maule's blood to drink!" [...] The sudden death of a Pyncheon, about a hundred years ago, with circumstances <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> have been related of the Colonel's exit, was held as giving additional probability to the received opinion on this topic. It was considered, moreover, an ugly and ominous circumstance, that Colonel Pyncheon's picture--in obedience, it was said, to a provision of his will--remained affixed to the wall of the room in which he died. Those stern, immitigable features seemed to symbolize an evil influence, and so darkly to mingle the shadow of their presence with the sunshine of the passing hour, that no good thoughts or purposes could ever spring up and blossom there. To the thoughtful mind there will be no tinge of superstition in what we figuratively express, by affirming that the ghost of a dead progenitor--perhaps as a portion of his own punishment--is often doomed to become the Evil Genius of his family.|$|E

In Goffman’s (1981) terms, surgeons not only engage in ‘conversations’ but also ‘coordinated task activity’. The chief concern of participants in a conversation is ‘talk’; in coordinated task activity it is a ‘practical’ task.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} Boolean networks subject to a selective pressure which favors robustness against noise, {{as a model of}} evolved genetic regulatory systems.

This segregated structure is <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> qualitatively <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is found in gene regulatory networks, where only a much smaller subset of genes [...] - those responsible for transcription factors [...] - is responsible for global regulation.
