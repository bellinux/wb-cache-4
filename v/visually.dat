5|$|ClearText, {{which enables}} <b>visually</b> {{impaired}} users to browse the web more easily by making text {{easier for them}} to read, was developed in conjunction with the college. In 2009 RNC lecturer Tony Sales developed Vinux, an accessible version of the Linux operating system for the <b>visually</b> impaired.|$|E
5|$|Geiger was {{guide to}} Gallagher at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, where they won {{a bronze medal}} in the women's giant slalom <b>visually</b> {{impaired}} event. They came seventh in the women's slalom <b>visually</b> impaired.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, at the IPC Alpine Skiing World Cup in Thredbo, New South Wales, {{several weeks}} after taking on her new guide, Christian Geiger, she won two silver medals in giant slalom and slalom. At the 2014 Sochi Paralympics, Gallagher (guided by Geiger) won a bronze medal in the Women's Giant Slalom <b>Visually</b> Impaired and came seventh in the Women's Giant Slalom <b>Visually</b> Impaired.|$|E
5|$|At the 2011 IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships, with Bor as her guide, Perrine won {{a silver}} medal in the vision-impaired {{downhill}} event, the first one ever earned by an Australian woman at the event. She also earned bronze medals in the women’s vision impaired Super Combined and super-G events.

At the Winter Games IPC event at Coronet Peak that same month, she and Bor finished first in the women's slalom <b>visually</b> impaired event.|$|E
5|$|Bor is a {{guide for}} <b>visually</b> {{impaired}} skiers. In this role, he skis {{in front of the}} <b>visually</b> impaired skier and gives him or her direction to get down the course using speakers and a microphone. At the 2006 Winter Paralympics in Torino, Bor served as an Australian assistant coach. In 2009, following those Games, he shifted his role to serve as Melissa Perrine's guide as Perrine advanced further in the sport. He first skied with Perrine at a World Cup event in January 2010 where they finished fourth.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1871 in London as the Royal Normal College and Academy for the Blind, {{the college}} {{had a number}} of homes before moving to its campus in Hereford; it was renamed the Royal National College for the Blind in the late 1970s. It has been a pioneer in the {{education}} of <b>visually</b> impaired people in Britain since the Victorian era, and, as of 2010, is the only college for <b>visually</b> impaired students in the United Kingdom to have been awarded Beacon Status in recognition of its outstanding teaching and learning.|$|E
5|$|Four British judokas {{qualified}} for the Games, all events were for <b>visually</b> impaired athletes. A single medal was won, by Sam Ingram, in the men's 90kg category.|$|E
5|$|Makemake is {{currently}} <b>visually</b> the second-brightest Kuiper belt object after Pluto, having a March opposition apparent magnitude of 17.0 {{in the constellation}} Coma Berenices. This is bright enough to be visible using a high-end amateur telescope.|$|E
5|$|Only one of {{the victims}} was <b>visually</b> identifiable. Eventually, 147 were {{identified}} by fingerprint, dental records, and X-ray comparisons. The remaining 81 were identified through DNA tests.|$|E
5|$|Sabarmati Marathon is {{organised}} {{every year}} in December–January since 2011 which have different categories like full and half marathon, 7km dream run, 5km run for <b>visually</b> challenged and 5km wheelchair run. In 2007, Ahmedabad hosted the 51st national level shooting games.|$|E
5|$|The Ood-Sphere is in {{the same}} solar system as the Sense-Sphere, the {{location}} for the 1964 serial The Sensorites; the Sensorites and Ood are <b>visually</b> and mentally similar.|$|E
5|$|The mule, {{especially}} its fur, was intensely textured and detailed {{to make it}} look <b>visually</b> rough and bristly, and the mule itself weary and worn. The same techniques were applied to the red and yellow adornments draped and hung over the animal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Visually</b> Impaired: Athletes {{with vision}} {{impairment}} ranging from partial vision, sufficient {{to be judged}} legally blind, to total blindness.|$|E
5|$|A comet may be {{discovered}} photographically using a wide-field telescope or <b>visually</b> with binoculars. However, even {{without access to}} optical equipment, {{it is still possible}} for the amateur astronomer to discover a sungrazing comet online by downloading images accumulated by some satellite observatories such as SOHO. SOHO's 2000th comet was discovered by Polish amateur astronomer Michał Kusiak on 26 December 2010 and both discoverers of Hale-Bopp used amateur equipment (although Hale was not an amateur).|$|E
5|$|Access {{to parts}} of the station is {{difficult}} for people with physical disability. The introduction of lifts in 2010 made the taxi rank and underground station accessible from the concourse, though customers found them unreliable and frequently broken down. Wayfindr technology {{was introduced to the}} station in 2015 to help the <b>visually</b> impaired navigate the station.|$|E
5|$|After Marcoux {{had lost}} his vision, his brother Billy Joe (B.J.) Marcoux decided to put his college {{education}} on hold in order to assist him with skiing. Alpine Canada introduced them to {{a new kind of}} skiing called Para-Alpine. They were inspired by the McKeever brothers to do <b>visually</b> impaired para-alpine. Other than the Paralympics, his brother B.J. has been his sighted guide using radio communication ever since then; something they had never used before.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft are {{inspected}} during {{maintenance operations}} either outdoors on an airport between flights, or in a hangar for longer-duration inspections. These inspections are conducted mainly by human operators, <b>visually</b> and sometimes using tools to assess defects. The project aims to improve inspections of aircraft and traceability. A database dedicated to each aircraft type, containing images and three-dimensional scans, will be updated after each maintenance. This allows for example {{to assess the}} propagation of a crack.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bor (born 14 April 1963) is an Australian ski {{coach and}} sighted guide for <b>visually</b> {{impaired}} skiers. He was a {{coach at the}} 2006 Winter Paralympics in Torino, and was Melissa Perrine's guide skier at the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver and 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} public–private {{partnership}} {{arrangement for}} maintenance of the London Underground, the station was refurbished by Metronet during 2005 and 2006. Works included provision of tactile strips and colour contrasted handrails for the <b>visually</b> impaired, installation of closed-circuit television cameras, passenger help points, new electronic departure information displays on the platforms, a new public address system, and improved lighting. The station does not have step free access from the platforms to the street.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the city}} of Lawton is {{undertaking}} the Downtown Revitalization Project. Its goal is to redesign the areas between Elmer Thomas Park at the north through Central Mall to the south to be more <b>visually</b> appealing and pedestrian friendly to encourage business growth in the area.|$|E
5|$|At the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Bor and Perrine {{finished}} {{fourth in the}} women's downhill for <b>visually</b> impaired, and did not finish in three other events. She was disqualified after the slalom leg of the women's super combined for wearing a visor which was taped to her helmet.|$|E
5|$|BLM {{counts the}} herd <b>visually</b> about {{every four years}} by flying over the range, {{reporting}} on each animal found, and using statistical methods to correct for historic undercounting and other problems. In 1984, BLM set the maximum carrying capacity of the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range at 121 adult animals, and revised this to 95 adult animals in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{distance}} of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4arcseconds, {{the smallest of the}} Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it <b>visually.</b> Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO).|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the great}} range of {{anatomical}} diversity among molluscs, many textbooks start the subject of molluscan anatomy by describing what is called an archi-mollusc, hypothetical generalized mollusc, or hypothetical ancestral mollusc (HAM) to illustrate the most common features found within the phylum. The depiction is <b>visually</b> rather similar to modern monoplacophorans, and some suggest it may resemble very early molluscs.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics often vary by habitat, between shade-dwelling genera (such as Prosartes, Tricyrtis, Cardiocrinum, Clintonia, Medeola, Prosartes, and Scoliopus) and sun loving genera. Shade-dwelling genera {{usually have}} broader leaves with smooth edges and net venation, and fleshy fruits (berries) with animal-dispersed seeds, rhizomes, and small, {{inconspicuous}} flowers while genera native to sunny habitats usually have narrow, parallel-veined leaves, capsular fruits with wind-dispersed seeds, bulbs, and large, <b>visually</b> conspicuous flowers. (See also Evolution).|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its strong}} {{advantage}} among younger women, and baby boomers reaching menopause, Playtex continued to gain market share on Tampax. After extensive market research, Tampax reversed that trend with the 2002 introduction of Pearl, with an applicator {{designed to be}} as <b>visually</b> appealing as it was functional, and making the brand once again appealing to teens.|$|E
5|$|During the Vietnam War, Yehudi {{lights were}} again tried, this time mounted to an F-4 Phantom painted in a dull blue-and-white {{camouflage}} pattern. The experiment reduced by 30% the distance at which an observer <b>visually</b> acquired the Phantom. In 1997, active camouflage was again investigated, {{this time with}} thin computer-controlled fluorescent panels or light-emitting polymer covering much of an aircraft's surface.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{cars and}} plug-in hybrids when {{operating}} in all-electric mode at low speeds produce less roadway noise {{as compared to}} vehicles propelled by an internal combustion engine, thereby reducing harmful noise health effects. However, blind people or the <b>visually</b> impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars and conventional hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard when operating at low speeds.|$|E
5|$|Etherington {{has only}} five percent vision in both eyes and competes in the <b>visually</b> {{impaired}} category. Because of her impairment she requires a sighted guide, Caroline Powell. The pair have competed together since August 2013. After {{asking for a}} new guide through Facebook and after two other applicants pulled out, Etherington and Powell combined in April 2013.|$|E

Passengers with National Entitlement Cards eligible for concessionary travel but issued by other local authorities are not offered any fare concession, {{with the exception of}} blind or <b>visually</b> impaired cardholders.|$|E
5|$|Gallagher first {{represented}} Australia in 2009 at the New Zealand Winter Games, {{where she}} won a gold medal. In January 2010, she competed at her first IPC Alpine Skiing World Cup event in Austria and won a bronze medal in slalom. Before {{the start of the}} 2010 Games, she had competed in nine World Cup events. On her 24th birthday, {{she won a}} bronze medal at the Vancouver games in the Women's Slalom <b>visually</b> impaired event, becoming the first Australian woman to do so. In her first and second time down the hill, she finished third both times, She also competed in the Women's Giant Slalom <b>visually</b> impaired event at the 2010 Games, finishing seventh after headset issues that caused problems with communication.|$|E
5|$|Goalball is a Paralympic sport {{played by}} athletes {{who are blind}} and <b>visually</b> impaired. At the 2008 Paralympics, the U.S. men's goalball team hoped to repeat their bronze medal {{performance}} in Athens, but lost to Sweden in the final. The U.S. women's goalball team improved on their silver medal performance in Athens, defeating China in the gold medal match.|$|E
5|$|Goliath was {{announced}} at its {{new home in}} San Antonio on September 27, 2007. Goliath was transported {{to the park and}} got a complete make over with a whole new color scheme to provide a colorful and <b>visually</b> striking landmark as guests enter the park. Goliath opened on April 18, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Harisu {{published}} {{a collection of}} essays in Japan in March 2008, titled Haris Beauty (sic). The essays formed a comprehensive guide to beauty, diet and fashion, and contained photographs of Harisu taken by Yamagishi Shin, who had traveled to Seoul the previous December for a four-day photo shoot. Harisu also provided narration for the <b>visually</b> impaired for the 2008 film If You Were Me: Anima Version 2, an animated film about human rights.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} {{of the city of}} Tapiocapolis was <b>visually</b> based on the city of Belo Horizonte in Brazil. His {{depiction of}} a public sculpture in the city was inspired by the work of sculptor Marcel Arnould, while the paintings that he designed for the Tapiocapolis hotel in which Tintin and Haddock stay are {{based on the work of}} Serge Poliakoff.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 {{at the age}} of seven, {{shortly before}} Knight lost the {{majority}} of her sight, she had been to France on a skiing holiday and was encouraged to try the sport by her mother. Her mother was Knight's first sighted guide until late January 2013 for financial reasons. The pair competed together in <b>visually</b> impaired (VI) races.|$|E
