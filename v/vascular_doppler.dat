40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} systematic use of intraoperative Doppler ultrasound during microsurgical subinguinal varicocele repair. Design: Prospective clinical study. Setting: Andrology laboratory and male infertility section of the urology department of a tertiary care hospital. Patient(s) : Two hundred and thirteen men with clinical varicocele. Intervention(s) : Subinguinal microsurgical varicocele ligation using an intraoperative <b>vascular</b> <b>Doppler</b> flow detector. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Number of veins ligated, lymphatic spared, arteries identified or accidentally ligated. Result(s) : A statistically significant greater number of arteries were identified and preserved when intraoperative <b>vascular</b> <b>Doppler</b> was used. In addition, {{the average number of}} internal spermatic veins ligated was statistically significantly greater in the same group. Accidental artery ligation occurred in two cases (1. 1 %) in which the Doppler was not applied. There was no statistically significant difference in number of lymphatics spared between groups. Conclusion(s) : Our findings showed that concomitant use of intraoperative <b>vascular</b> <b>Doppler</b> during microsurgical varicocelectomy allows more arterial branches to be preserved, and more internal spermatic veins are likely to be ligated. This device should be considered an attractive tool to improve surgical outcomes and safety. (Fertil Steril (R) 2010; 93 : 2396 - 9. (C) 2010 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine. ...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{conventional}} {{method for}} measuring the ankle-brachial index (ABI) requires a <b>vascular</b> <b>Doppler</b> machine and a trained professional, which is a barrier to the examination becoming more widely adopted across health services. For this reason, the possibility of substituting Doppler monitors for other types of device has been investigated. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the validity, reliability and accuracy of taking ABI measurement using oscillometric devices and compare them to <b>vascular</b> <b>Doppler.</b> METHODS: This is an integrative literature review of four articles. RESULTS: There was very little uniformity between the four studies in terms of ample populations or the methodological procedures used to measure systolic pressures. The results for sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values varied and so did measures of reliability.

40|$|Aim: Assess {{vascular}} {{indices of}} 7 - 10 week embryos using three-dimensional power Doppler (3 DPD) and correlate {{them with the}} crown-rump length (CRL). Methods: This cross-sectional study included 65 healthy pregnancies between 7 and 10 weeks. the three-dimensional volume of the embryo was obtained using an endocavitary volumetric transducer and the VOCAL (Virtual Organ Computer-aided Analysis) method, with a 128 rotation angle and 15 sequential planes. the vascularization (VI), flow (FI) and the vascular and flow (VFI) indices were obtained using 3 DPD and the mean, median, standard deviation, maximum and minimum values were calculated for each gestational age. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) {{was used to evaluate}} the correlation between vascular indices and CRL. Results: the VI ranged from 0. 77 to 41. 67, mean 14. 68 (+/- 8. 60), the FI went from 25. 71 to 139. 50, mean 90. 61 (+/- 21. 51) and the VFI from 0. 20 to 81. 57, mean 15. 69 (+/- 12. 42). the correlation between CRL and all 3 D power <b>Doppler</b> <b>vascular</b> indices was low (VI - r=- 0. 073, P= 0. 566; FI - r= 0. 173, P= 0. 168 and VFI - r=- 0. 004, P= 0. 974).

40|$|The {{superficial}} temporal artery (STA) {{is frequently}} used as donor vessel in extracranial to intracranial bypass surgery. Current techniques typically {{rely on a}} <b>Doppler</b> <b>vascular</b> probe to identify the STA trajectory prior to the skin incision; however, this step can be time consuming and difficult when the arterial course is tortuous. We tested an alternative neuronavigation-based technique for locating the STA. In this method, preoperative magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) {{was used to determine}} STA outlines that were then projected and traced onto the skin. The neuronavigation-based technique was applied to eight STA dissections. The accuracy of this method was evaluated by comparing the navigation-based STA course with the doppler-based one and the actual STA course intraoperatively. STA trajectory was determined before surgery by using three imaging techniques: CTA (3 cases), three-dimensional (3 D) contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted MRA (4 cases), and/or 3 D time-of-flight MRA (5 cases). In all cases, the neuronavigation-based STA position was confirmed with the <b>Doppler</b> <b>vascular</b> probe before skin incision and corresponded to the actual vessel position intraoperatively. As long as the skin is not mobilized during preoperative image acquisition and surgery, this neuronavigation-based approach is a valid method to identify STA course. During the preoperative planning process, the STA trajectory should be analyzed from its origin {{at the level of the}} foramen spinosum to avoid mistaking nearby venous structures as the STA.

Placental volume was obtained using the 30 degrees virtual organ computer-aided analysis (VOCAL) method. the mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum and maximum values were calculated for three vascular indices: the VI, vascularisation index; the FI, flow index and the VFI, vascularisation and flow index. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) {{was used to assess}} the correlation between vascular indices and crown-rump length (CRL). Our results showed mean (+/- SD) values ranged from 8. 66 +/- 12. 04 to 15. 34 +/- 13. 89 for the VI, from 63. 83 +/- 43. 61 to 109. 22 +/- 33. 87 for the FI and from 9. 52 +/- 13. 86 to 20. 59 +/- 22. 97 for the VFI. There was no correlation between CRL and VI (r = 0. 073, p = 0. 630) nor VFI (r = 0. 147 and p = 0. 037); there was a weak correlation between CRL and FI (r = 0. 332, p = 0. 037).
