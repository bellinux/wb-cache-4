25|$|Hatch {{first had}} to {{convince}} a group of USAID officers that his epiphany would pay off—for the rural poor {{and the government of}} the United States, whose grant dollars would fund the first projects. Remarkably, the officials liked his innovative idea and provided an initial grant of $1 million. Hatch and his Peruvian business partner, Aquiles Lanao, launched the program in five separate geographical areas of Bolivia and within four weeks, they had created funds in 280 villages serving 14,000 families with loans worth $630,000. Hatch's clients in Bolivia were puzzled at first by <b>village</b> <b>banking</b> because it represented a significant departure from business as usual. They were intrigued enough to try it, however, and it was an immediate success. When Hatch's client in Bolivia changed its in-country team, the new representatives shut the program down. More cautious than the original client team, the new group acknowledged the program's success but still felt that uncollateralized lending to very poor people was too risky. Undeterred, Hatch spent the next few months training others in the <b>village</b> <b>banking</b> methodology, helping open new programs throughout Latin America, and building the institution that would {{come to be known as}} FINCA International. FINCA incorporated in 1985.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} other {{microcredit}} methodologies, <b>village</b> <b>banking</b> eliminates collateral (the poor man's obstacle to receiving commercial bank loans) as a loan prerequisite. Instead, it relies on a system of cross-guarantees, where each member of a village bank ensures the loan of every other member. This system gives rise to an atmosphere of social pressure within the village bank, where the cost of social embarrassment motivates bank members to repay their loans in full. The admixture of cross-guarantees and social pressure {{makes it possible for}} even the poorest people to receive loans. This method has proven very effective for FINCA, yielding a repayment rate of over 97% in its worldwide network.|$|E
25|$|Its {{ability to}} achieve {{financial}} sustainability allowed FINCA to make considerable expansions in the 1980s and 1990s in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and the Newly Independent States of the Former Soviet Union. In 1995, FINCA entered the former Soviet Union by establishing a <b>Village</b> <b>Banking</b> program in Kyrgyzstan. In 1997, FINCA co-sponsored the first Microcredit Summit, with over 2,000 policymakers, practitioners, and donors discussing ways to expand microcredit programs. In 2000, FINCA {{became one of the}} first economic development organizations to enter Kosovo after the June 1999 cease-fire. In the 2000s, FINCA continued its penetration into the Newly Independent States by establishing new programs in Central Asia. Its most recent programs were launched in Afghanistan, in 2004 (see FINCA Afghanistan), and Jordan in 2007. In April 2009, FINCA Kyrgyzstan became the second program to pass the 100,000 client mark.|$|E

With its headquarters in Washington, D.C., FINCA has 20 affiliated host-country institutions (affiliates), in Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, Eurasia and the Middle East and South Asia.

50|$|<b>Village</b> <b>banking</b> is a {{microcredit}} methodology whereby {{financial services}} are administered locally rather than centralized {{in a formal}} bank. <b>Village</b> <b>banking</b> {{has its roots in}} ancient cultures and was most recently adopted for use by micro-finance institutions (MFIs) as a way to control costs. Early MFI <b>village</b> <b>banking</b> methods were innovated by Grameen Bank and then later developed by groups such as FINCA International founder John Hatch. Among US-based non-profit agencies there are at least 31 microfinance institutions (MFIs) that have collectively created over 800 <b>village</b> <b>banking</b> programs in at least 90 countries.

50|$|A <b>village</b> <b>bank</b> is an {{informal}} self-help support group of 20-30 members, predominantly female heads-of-household. If {{the program is}} “on mission”, in a normal <b>village</b> <b>bank</b> about 50% of all new members entering the program will be severely poor—representing families with a daily per-capita expenditure (DPCE) of less than US$1; the rest are moderately poor (DPCE=$1-2/day) or non-poor (DPCE >$2). These women meet once {{a week in the}} home of one of their members to avail themselves of working capital loans, a safe place to save, skill training, mentoring, and motivation. Loans normally start at $50-$100 and are linked to savings such that the more a client saves the more she can borrow. The normal loan period is four months and is repaid in 16 weekly installments. At the end of 2006, 95% of clients covered by a benchmark sample of 71 NGOs and institutions engaged in <b>village</b> <b>bank</b> lending were women.|$|R

[...] It uses the <b>village</b> <b>banking</b> microfinance model to help the rural communities. <b>Village</b> <b>banking</b> treats the whole community as one unit, and establishes semi-formal or formal institutions through which micro-finance is dispensed. The banks are run by their own people: they choose their members, elect their own officers, establish their own by-laws, distribute loans to individuals, and collect payments and savings. Their loans are backed, not by goods or property, but by moral collateral: the promise that the group stands behind each individual loan. Therefore, this {{is a means of}} ensuring that each individual will be disciplined in saving up to repay their own loans. 86% of SEEDS beneficiaries actually had functioning micro enterprises. Statistics have shown that 51% of SEEDS beneficiaries showed increased revenues while 73% of them showed increased profits.|$|E

We first examine the geographic placement decisions of competitors, and find that placement decisions are strongly affected by district-level characteristics. We observe that increased competition induces a decline in repayment performance and in savings deposited with the incumbent <b>Village</b> <b>Bank,</b> suggesting multiple loan-taking by clients. Urban clients take multiple loans primarily from lenders with more individual methodologies, while rural clients borrow from several group lenders. Individuals who operate larger businesses are the ones most likely to leave the incumbent <b>Village</b> <b>Bank</b> when a Solidarity Group lender enters the marketplace...|$|R
