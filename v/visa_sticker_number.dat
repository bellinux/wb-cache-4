50|$|The SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme was {{launched}} in 1992. The leaders at the Fourth Summit (Islamabad, 29-31 December 1988), while realising {{the importance of having}} people to people contacts, among the peoples of SAARC countries, decided that certain categories of dignitaries should be entitled to a Special Travel document, which would exempt them from visas within the region. As directed by the Summit, the Council of Ministers regularly kept under review the list of entitled categories.Currently, the list included 24 categories of entitled persons, which include Dignitaries, Judges of higher courts, Parliamentarians, Senior Officials, Businessmen, Journalists, Sportsmen etc.The <b>Visa</b> <b>Stickers</b> are issued by the respective Member States to the entitled categories of that particular country. The validity of the <b>Visa</b> <b>Sticker</b> is generally for one year. The implementation is reviewed regularly by the Immigration Authorities of SAARC Member States.|$|R
50|$|As {{the status}} of Kosovo was and remains controversial, the {{document}} was not widely accepted. For those countries that did accept it, its non-passport status sometimes restricted its applications. For example, although the US did accept the UNMIK Travel Document, it did not place <b>visa</b> <b>stickers</b> in the document itself, but on a detached sheet.|$|R

50|$|OCI Cards were {{formerly}} {{printed with}} a separate lifelong “U” <b>Visa</b> <b>Sticker</b> (which was pasted on the applicant's passport). The proof of lifelong visa is now just the OCI Card which has a “Life Time Visa” printed on it. The OCI Card is valid for travel but must be carried with a valid passport overseas passport. Generally airlines will ask to see both when travelling to and from India, as will Indian customs and police at Airport counters.|$|R

50|$|People who {{are granted}} {{permanent}} residency {{in a country}} are usually issued some sort of documentary evidence as legal proof of this status. In the past, many countries merely stamped the person's passport indicating that the holder was admitted as a permanent resident or that he/she was exempt from immigration control and permitted to work without restriction. Other countries would issue a photo ID card, place a <b>visa</b> <b>sticker</b> or certificate of residence in the person's passport, or issue a letter to confirm their permanent resident status.|$|R

50|$|A {{few days}} later the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) said it will review claims that two new Ford hybrid {{vehicles}} are not delivering the advertised 47 mpg. Linc Wehrly, Director of Light-duty Vehicle Center Compliance Division at EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan commented that hybrids have far more variability in miles per gallon than a conventional vehicle. All vehicles are run through the same EPA fuel-efficiency test but the test is not administered by the EPA, instead the automakers conduct the test and EPA often conducts reviews. Most vehicles' real-world gas mileage {{is less than the}} EPA <b>sticker</b> <b>number,</b> and can often be 20% less than the <b>sticker</b> <b>number</b> depending on speed, temperature and other factors. The EPA explained that with hybrids the gap is much wider, as high as a 30% drop.|$|R

This reinforces the fact that driving styles, driving conditions, and other factors can cause mileage to vary." [...] A Ford spokesman also said they followed EPA's test guidelines and the company is standing by the ratings as determined by the current testing protocols. Nevertheless, they are working closely with the agency to determine if any changes are needed for the industry relative to hybrid vehicle testing.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the plague had retreated from Europe, making a last {{appearance}} in Northern Germany in 1682 and vanishing from the continent in 1684. The subsequent wave hitting Europe during the Great Northern War most probably had {{its origins in}} Central Asia, spreading to Europe via Anatolia and Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire. Georg <b>Sticker</b> <b>numbered</b> this epidemic as the [...] "12th period" [...] of plague epidemics, first recorded in Ahmedabad in 1683 and until 1724 affecting a territory from India over Persia, Asia Minor, the Levant and Egypt to Nubia and Ethiopia {{as well as to}} Morocco and southern France {{on the one hand and}} to East Central Europe up to Scandinavia on the other hand. Constantinople was reached in 1685 and remained a site of infection for the subsequent years. Sporadically, the plague had entered Poland–Lithuania since 1697, yet the wave of the plague that met and followed the armies of the Great Northern War was first recorded in Poland in 1702.|$|R

2500|$|In {{response}} to persistent demands for dual citizenship, {{particularly from the}} diaspora in North America and other developed countries, the Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) scheme was introduced by amending The Citizenship Act, 1955 in August 2005. The scheme was launched during the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas convention at Hyderabad in 2006. Indian authorities have interpreted the law to mean a person cannot have a second country's passport simultaneously with an Indian one — even {{in the case of}} a child who is claimed by another country as a citizen of that country, and who may be required by the laws of the other country to use one of its passports for foreign travel (such as a child born in the United States or in Australia to Indian parents), and the Indian courts have given the executive branch wide discretion over this matter. Therefore, Overseas Citizenship of India is not an actual citizenship of India and thus, does not amount to dual citizenship or dual nationality or anyone no longer to use Indian IDs after OCI. Moreover, the OCI card is not a substitute for an Indian visa and therefore, the passport which displays the lifetime visa must be carried by OCI holders while travelling to India.OCI Cards are now being printed without the lifelong “U” <b>Visa</b> <b>Sticker</b> (which is normally pasted on the applicant's passport). [...] The proof of lifelong visa will be just the OCI Card which will have “Life Time Visa” printed on it. [...] The OCI Card will be valid with any Valid Passport."However, countries may consider the OCI as dual citizenship: for example, the UK government considers that, for purposes of the British Nationality Act 1981, [...] "OCI is considered to be citizenship of another State".|$|R

50|$|In January 2013, the Land Transportation Office ventured on {{the plate}} {{standardization}} project with modern security features which include holograms and bar codes, and also planned to phase out the old plate format {{which has been in}} use since 1981. In the new format, the LTO will issue LLL-DDDD for four-wheel vehicles and LL-DDDDD for motorcycles. The alphanumeric symbols for private cars will be black on a white background, while those for public utility vehicles (PUVs) would continue on black on yellow with the authorized route also to be indicated. Motorcycle plates would also be black on white, as would those for tricycles used for personal purposes. Tricycles used as PUVs would also continue with the black on yellow scheme. Government plates, meanwhile, would have sport red symbols on a white background, with the name of the agency/office to be indicated. Diplomatic plates would continue carry blue symbols on a white background, while Other Exempt Vehicles (OEV) would have black symbols on a light blue background. The new plate format series and design was originally scheduled for release on September or October 2013. However, it has been delayed several times primarily due to concerns on the release of funds for the license plate project, as well as the increase in purchase of new cars using temporary license plates bearing the conduction <b>sticker</b> <b>number.</b> Eventually, on May 2014, the first batch of new license plates were finally released. By January 2015, vehicle owners are now required to change their old plates into a modern series plate, and pay PhP 450 for a replacement.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stickers</b> with <b>numbers</b> on {{are stuck}} to the target face, with each number {{corresponding}} to a particular prize. Archers shoot at the target until all the prizes have been won or, alternatively, all archers can shoot a predetermined number of arrows at each target. If two archers hit the same sticker, it is either the first to do so or the one closest {{to the center of}} the sticker that wins the prize. A variation on this involves covering the target and stickers with newspaper, so no one will know if they have won a prize until the newspaper has been removed. In this situation, each archer would shoot 3 arrows at each target.|$|R

5000|$|From 28 September 1998 to 2011 the {{passport}} was issued as a booklet, {{made in a}} similar style to a cheque book. This included the same information as before, but with spaces for bar-coded <b>stickers</b> for holding <b>numbers,</b> and many pages to allow for numerous movements. The prepaid cards were incorporated in the booklet as tear-out pages, so animals with this format of passport did not also need a Certificate of CTS Registration.|$|R
