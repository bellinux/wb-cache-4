5|$|A prequel, Dragon Warrior Monsters (Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry's Wonderland in Japan), was {{released}} in 1998. This game featured Terry and Milly years before the events of Dragon Quest VI. It {{was released}} in North America the next year, even though Dragon Quest VI was never released in North America. Along with Terry and Milly, several of the main enemies, including Mortamor, reappear, however, their previous roles have been eliminated, making them appear as just normal enemies. Mortamor and Murdaw (DeathMore and Mudou, respectively, in the localization) do appear as <b>very</b> <b>challenging,</b> very late in-game bosses, though.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{present a}} <b>very</b> <b>challenging</b> {{environment}} for animals. Not {{only do they}} require food and water but {{they also need to}} keep their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways birds are the most able to do this of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated desert floor by using thermals to soar in the cooler air at great heights. In order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The cream-colored courser flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs, stopping periodically to snatch up insects. Like other desert birds it is well-camouflaged by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary. The sandgrouse is an expert at this and nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily. Some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface. The desert lark takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its environment.|$|E

25|$|Obtaining the {{molecular}} clone {{of a gene}} {{can lead to the}} development of organisms that produce the protein product of the cloned genes, termed a recombinant protein. In practice, it is frequently more difficult to develop an organism that produces an active form of the recombinant protein in desirable quantities than it is to clone the gene. This is because {{the molecular}} signals for gene expression are complex and variable, and because protein folding, stability and transport can be <b>very</b> <b>challenging.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{humanitarian}} {{situation was}} not as acute in the other nations bordering Rwanda, though still <b>very</b> <b>challenging.</b> Tanzania {{had a number of}} refugee camps that had been created for the civilians fleeing the onset of the Burundian Civil War. Most of these Burundians had returned to their home country by 1994 so Tanzania had the infrastructure to handle the initial influx of Rwandan refugees. However, facilities there were also eventually overwhelmed by the sheer number of people fleeing across the border, requiring emergency humanitarian intervention.|$|E
25|$|In a {{cognitive}} radio system, unlicensed secondary users {{can use the}} resources which is licensed for primary users. When primary users want to use their licensed resources, secondary users has to vacate these resources. Hence secondary users have to constantly sense the channel for detecting the presence of primary user. It is <b>very</b> <b>challenging</b> to sense the activity of spatially distributed primary users in wireless channel. Spatially distributed nodes can improve the channel sensing reliability by sharing the information and reduce the probability of false alarming.|$|E

25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} of the {{transmission electron microscope}} {{is the need for}} extremely thin sections of the specimens, typically about 100 nanometers. Creating these thin sections for biological and materials specimens is technically <b>very</b> <b>challenging.</b> Semiconductor thin sections can be made using a focused ion beam. Biological tissue specimens are chemically fixed, dehydrated and embedded in a polymer resin to stabilize them sufficiently to allow ultrathin sectioning. Sections of biological specimens, organic polymers and similar materials may require staining with heavy atom labels in order to achieve the required image contrast.|$|E
25|$|The 1960s were <b>very</b> <b>challenging</b> {{years for}} Phi Iota Alpha. The {{effects of the}} Vietnam War and the '60s counter-culture created an anti-institutional {{atmosphere}} amongst many college students. In addition, this drastically reduced the enrollment of Latin American students in American universities. This in turn hindered potential membership to the organization. As a result, by 1968, {{after many years of}} struggle, the only active undergraduate chapters were at LSU, and at RPI. The chapter at RPI became inactive in 1973 with the graduation of its Secretary General. The Secretary General took with him the chapter's official fraternity documents. By 1979, the last active brother from the chapter at LSU graduated, thereby marking the closing of the undergraduate chapter at LSU.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{reception}} for MUSHA was mixed. Critics found themselves {{overwhelmed by the}} sheer amount of shoot 'em ups on the Sega Genesis and felt the title was unremarkable. Journalists generally agreed the game had great graphics and enjoyable gameplay, but felt it was unoriginal and not <b>very</b> <b>challenging.</b> In retrospect, MUSHA has garnered much higher praise, being cited for its challenging gameplay, strong soundtrack, and graphics considered ahead of its time. It remains among the most highly regarded shoot 'em ups on the Genesis and is considered among {{the best of the}} 16-bit era. Original MUSHA cartridges have become rare and command high prices in the collector market, however, the game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan in 2008, and the west in 2009.|$|E

25|$|Many of the Noachian valley {{networks}} have features strongly indicative of an origin from distributed precipitation: branched networks, valleys starting at narrow crests, V-shaped cross profiles, diffusional behavior of hillslopes. Conversely, using only geomorphic evidence, it is <b>very</b> <b>challenging</b> {{to build a}} strong argument against origin by precipitation. Precipitation also provides a straightforward recharge mechanism for subsurface aquifers, which doubtlessly do exist and are important in some cases (as on Earth). This precipitation may have occurred as rain or snow (with subsequent melt on the ground), but either demands a significantly more humid, and thus warmer and thicker, atmosphere than presently exists. A warmer, wetter Noachian is also supported by independent observations of rock weathering rates, Noachian-age crater lakes, and Noachian geology at the lander sites.|$|E
25|$|Impact {{velocities}} in {{the outer}} Solar System are typically ≈1km/s (compared with the escape velocity at the surface of Chariklo of ≈0.1km/s), and were even lower before the Kuiper belt was dynamically excited, supporting {{the possibility that the}} rings formed in the Kuiper belt before Chariklo was transferred to its current orbit less than 10 Myr ago. Impact velocities in the asteroid belt are much higher (≈5km/s), which could explain the absence of such ring features in minor bodies within the asteroid belt. Collisions between ring particles would cause the ring to widen substantially, and Poynting–Robertson drag would cause the ring particles to fall onto the central body within a few million years, requiring either an active source of ring particles or dynamical confinement by small (kilometre-sized) embedded or shepherd moons yet to be discovered. Such moons would be <b>very</b> <b>challenging</b> to detect via direct imaging from Earth due to the small radial separation of the ring system and Chariklo.|$|E
25|$|Asphalt {{was used}} {{starting}} in the 1960s as an hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds. Bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alpha-emitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in France, Belgium and Japan, but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues (risks of fire, as occurred in a bituminisation plant at Tokai Works in Japan) and long-term stability problems related to their geological disposal in deep rock formations. One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation {{because of the presence}} of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis. A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a semi-permeable membrane. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as selenium, technetium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium have an higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded anions. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste <b>very</b> <b>challenging.</b>|$|E
