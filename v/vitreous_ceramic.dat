25|$|A typical {{flush toilet}} is a <b>vitreous,</b> <b>ceramic</b> bowl {{containing}} water, plus plumbing to rapidly {{fill it with}} more water. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow siphon tube longer than {{the water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The top of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. If water is poured slowly into the bowl it simply flows over the rim of the upside-down U and pours slowly down the drain—thus the toilet does not flush. The standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a separate vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|E

One of the largest examples of wall art in Britain, it was commissioned by the London Borough of Sutton to celebrate the borough's heritage.

50|$|The mosaic {{was created}} from <b>vitreous</b> <b>ceramic</b> {{tesserae}} {{and put in}} place in 1994. It was initially created in a studio, using the reverse technique, whereby a full-size outline was drawn on paper in reverse. The tiles were then affixed to the paper with flour-and-water glue. At {{the end of the}} process, the paper and glue were washed off with water and the mosaic was grouted and polished. Consisting of well over 100,000 pieces, the mosaic took over 1,500 hours to design and construct.|$|E
5000|$|Stoneware is {{a rather}} broad term for pottery or other {{ceramics}} fired at a relatively high temperature. A modern technical definition is a <b>vitreous</b> or semi-vitreous <b>ceramic</b> made primarily from stoneware clay or non-refractory fire clay. [...] Whether vitrified or not, it is nonporous (does not soak up liquids); {{it may or may}} not be glazed. [...] Historically, across the world, it has usually been developed after earthenware and before porcelain, and has often been used for high-quality as well as utilitarian wares.|$|R

[...] One widely recognised definition is from the Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities, a European industry standard states [...] "Stoneware, which, though dense, impermeable and hard enough to resist scratching by a steel point, differs from porcelain because it is more opaque, and normally only partially vitrified. It may be vitreous or semi-vitreous. It is usually coloured grey or brownish because of impurities in the clay used for its manufacture, and is normally glazed." ...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{porcelain}} enamels are inorganic coatings for metallic components {{based on}} a special ceramic-vitreous matrix in which specific additives are randomly dispersed. The ceramic-vitreous matrix is made by a mixture of various raw materials and elements and in particular {{it is based on}} boron-silicate glass added with metal oxides(1) of titanium, zinc, tin, zirconia, alumina, ecc. These additions are often used to improve and enhance some important performances such as corrosion(2) and wear resistance, mechanical strength, fracture toughness and also aesthetic functions. The coating process, called enamelling, depends {{on the nature of the}} surface, but also on the kind of the used porcelain enamel. For metal sheets coatings two industrial processes are actually used: one {{based on a}} wet porcelain enamel and another based on a dry-silicone porcelain enamel. During the firing process, that is performed at about 870 °C in the case of a steel substrate, the enamel raw material melts and interacts with the metal substrate so enabling the formation of a continuous varying structure. The interface domain between the substrate and the external layer is made of a complex material system where the <b>ceramic</b> <b>vitreous</b> and the metal constituents are mixed. In particular four main regions can be identified, (i) the pure metal region, (ii) the region where the metal constituents are dominant compared with the <b>ceramic</b> <b>vitreous</b> components, (iii) the region where the <b>ceramic</b> <b>vitreous</b> constituents are dominant compared with the metal ones, and the fourth region (iv) composed by the pure <b>ceramic</b> <b>vitreous</b> material. It has also to be noticed the presence of metallic dendrites that hinder the substrate and the external layer passing through the interphase region. Each region of the final composite structure plays a specific role: the metal substrate has mainly the structural function, the interphase region and the embedded dendrites guarantee the adhesion of the external vitreous layer to the substrate and the external vitreous layer is characterized by an high tribological, corrosion and thermal shock resistance. Such material, due to its internal composition, functionalization and architecture can be considered as a functionally graded composite material. The knowledge of the mechanical, tribological and chemical behavior of such composites is not well established and the research is still in progress. In particular the mechanical performances data about the composite coating are not jet established. In the present work the Residual Stresses, the Young modulus and the First Crack Failure of the composite porcelain enamel coating are studied. Due to the differences of the porcelain composite enamel and steel thermal properties the enamelled steel sheets have residual stresses: compressive residual stress acts on the coating and tensile residual stress acts on the steel sheet. The residual stresses estimation has been performed by measuring the curvature of rectangular one-side coated specimens. The Young modulus and the First Crack Failure (FCF) of the coating have been estimated by four point bending tests (3 - 7) monitored by means of the Acoustic Emission (AE) technique(5, 6). In particular the AE information has been used to identify, during the bending tests, the displacement domain over which no coating failure occurs (Free Failure Zone, FFZ). In the FFZ domain, the Young modulus has been estimated according to ASTM D 6272 - 02. The FCF has been calculated as the ratio between the displacement at the first crack of the coating and the coating thickness on the cracked side. The mechanical performances of the tested coated specimens have also been related and discussed to respective microstructure and surface characteristics by double entry charts...|$|R

40|$|<b>Vitreous</b> <b>ceramic</b> waste {{forms are}} being {{developed}} at Pacific Northwest Laboratory to complement glass waste forms in implementing the Minimum Additive Waste Stabilization (MAWS) Program to support the US Department of Energy`s environmental restoration efforts. These vitreous ceramics are composed of various metal-oxide crystalline phases embedded in a silicate-glass phase. This work extends the success of <b>vitreous</b> <b>ceramic</b> waste forms to treat wastes with both high metal and high alkali contents. Two successful approaches are discussed: developing high-durability alkali-binding crystals in a durable glassy matrix, and developing water-soluble crystals in a durable and continuous glassy matrix. Nepheline-vitreous ceramics were demonstrated for the immobilization of high-alkali wastes with alkali contents up to 21 wt%. The chemical durability of the nepheline-vitreous ceramics {{is better than the}} corresponding glasses, especially in over longer times. Vitreous ceramics with Cs{sub 2 }O loading up to 35. 4 wt% have been developed. <b>Vitreous</b> <b>ceramic</b> waste forms were developed from 90 and 100 % Oak Ridge National Laboratory K- 25 pond sludge. Heat treatment resulted in targeted crystal formation of spinels, potassium feldspar, and Ca-P phases. The K- 25 pond sludge vitreous ceramics were up to 42 times more durable than high-level environmental assessments (EA) glass. The toxicity characteristics leach procedure (TCLP) concentration of LVC- 6 is at least 2, 000 times lower than US Environmental Protection Agency limits. Idaho Chemical Process Plant (ICPP) calcined wastes were immobilized into vitreous ceramics with calcine loading up to 88 %. These ICPP-vitreous ceramics were more durable than the EA glass by factors of 5 to 30. <b>Vitreous</b> <b>ceramic</b> waste forms {{are being developed}} to complement, not to replace, glass waste forms...|$|E
40|$|Quality {{control systems}} focus on {{maintaining}} standards in manufactured products. To improve the homogeneity of batches received by final users and to detect manufacturing defaults, a visual control stage is integrated into production line before the packing operation. At this stage, {{the products are}} inspected, mostly by human eye, for their obvious external defects; e. g., chips, cracks, scratches, holes and pitting, lumps, spots, notches, and glazing. This task {{is often referred to}} as visual inspection which is important to categorize the final products into quality-constant batches. Prototypes are of invaluable help while inspecting the visual attributes of products. Visual quality of products is assessed with respect to these standard units and some quality ratings are made there on the results. However, assessing visual quality is somewhat an ambiguous and troublesome work. Therefore, it will be helpful to utilize a decision making technique, such as fuzzy logic, to facilitate and improve the process. This paper addresses first to the significance of visual inspection and assessment of visual quality of industrial products, and second, gives a unique application of visual quality assessment of <b>vitreous</b> china <b>ceramic</b> sanitary wares by using fuzzy logic method...|$|R
2500|$|From {{between the}} eighth and eighteenth centuries, {{the use of}} glazed {{ceramics}} was prevalent in Islamic art, usually assuming the form of elaborate pottery.

[...] The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in Basra, dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of stoneware originating in 9th-century Iraq. It was a <b>vitreous</b> or semivitreous <b>ceramic</b> ware of fine texture, made primarily from non-refactory fire clay. [...] Other centres for innovative pottery in the Islamic world included Fustat (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and Tabriz (from 1470 to 1550).|$|R
40|$|A {{possible}} {{method for}} {{the reduction of}} civil Pu stockpiles is the reuse of Pu in mixed oxide fuel (MOX). During MOX fuel production, residues unsuitable for further recycle will be produced. Due to their high actinide content MOX residues require immobilization within a robust host matrix. Although {{it is possible to}} immobilize actinides in <b>vitreous</b> wasteforms; <b>ceramic</b> phases, such as brannerite (UTi 2 O 6), are attractive due to their high waste loading capacity and relative insolubility. A range of uranium brannerites, formulated GdxU 1 -xTi 2 O 6, were prepared using a mixed oxide route. Charge compensation of divalent and trivalent cations was expected to occur via the oxidation of U 4 + to higher valence states (U 5 + or U 6 +). Gd 3 + was added to act as a neutron absorber in the final Pu bearing wasteform. X-ray powder diffraction of synthesised specimens found that phase distribution was strongly affected by processing atmosphere (air or Ar). In all cases prototypical brannerite was formed accompanied by different secondary phases dependent on processing atmosphere. Microstructural analysis (SEM) of the sintered samples confirmed the results of the X-ray powder diffraction. The preliminary results presented here indicate that brannerite is a promising host matrix for mixed oxide fuel residues...|$|R

40|$|Zircon (ZrSiO{sub 4 }) is an {{actinide}} host {{phase in}} <b>vitreous</b> <b>ceramic</b> nuclear waste forms {{and a potential}} host phase for the disposition of excess weapons plutonium. In the present work, the effects of 800 and 900 keV electron and 1 MeV Ne{sup +} irradiations {{on the structure of}} single crystals of ZrSiO{sub 4 } have been investigated. The microstructural evolution during the irradiations was studied in situ using a high-voltage electron microscope interfaced to an ion accelerator at Argonne National Laboratory. The results indicate that electron irradiation at 15 K cannot amorphize ZrSiO{sub 4 } even at fluences an order of magnitude higher than that required for amorphization by 1. 5 MeV Kr{sup +} ions. However, the material is readily amorphized by 1 MeV Ne{sup +} irradiation at 15 K.

30|$|Despite the {{superior}} mechanical performance, {{one of the}} main problems of zirconia is related to adhesion failure {{as a result of its}} polycrystalline microstructure (absence of a glassy matrix) [13, 14], which is due to the fact that the mechanism to achieve enhanced mechanical interlocking is based on hydrofluoric acid etching, promoting dissolution of a glassy matrix on <b>vitreous</b> <b>ceramic</b> [9, 13, 15]. Thus, pursuit of techniques to improve bonding to the zirconia-based ceramic systems is important to prevent infiltration and increase fracture resistance [15]. Efforts to modify the characteristics of the surface energy of this material have been proposed by several manufacturers and researchers by employing different surface treatments [10, 16 – 19], such as sandblasting with aluminum oxide [20], blasting with glass beads [13, 18], coating with silica [21], hydrofluoric acid etching [21, 22], milling, diamond abrasion, and others [15]. It is important to highlight that there is also a relationship between surface treatments and phase transformation [9, 10].|$|E

40|$|Because of the {{introduction}} of the HTR Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) fuel cycle, the behavior of the U 0 $_{ 2 }$ TRISO-coated fuel particle was investigated in the various HEAD-END unit operations. The potential impact of this particle design on the HEAD-END unit operations was evaluated. The oxidation behavior of uncoated U 0 $_{ 2 }$ kernels was characterized in both static and fluidized bed combustion tests. It was shown that the oxidation of U 0 $_{ 2 }$ to U$_{ 3 }$ 0 $_{ 8 }$ in a fluid bed produced U$_{ 3 }$ 0 $_{ 8 }$fragments with no significant generation of fines. It was demonstrated that sintered metal blow-back filters efficiently separated the fines produced from the burner off-gas stream with no significant heavy metal loss. Using unirradiated TRISO-coated U 02 particles, the radioactive inventory of the SiC coating fragments, which are a waste stream from fluid-bed burning, were determined. The measurements showed that the SiC fragments must be classified as "long-lived, highly radioactive, alpha-containing" waste, and thus its heat generation rate must be considered. A possible conditioning might be hotpressing and sintering using a <b>vitreous</b> or <b>ceramic</b> powder matrix. The use of a jet mill to crush the SiC coating after burning of the matrix graphite was investigated. Crushing experiments with unirradiated particles demonstrated excellent efficiency in both coating breakage and kernel-coating separation.

This research has followed a reflective, heuristic approach of learning by doing, where one action leads to the next, exploring conceptual and technical aspects of my practice. I have investigated methods of making, together with exploring conceptual and formal qualities, to draw the hidden, unnoticed presence of these simple, familiar objects into the viewer&rsquo;s consciousness. The use of coloured vitreous enamel, and stains in painting medium have provided me with a vivid and vibrant palette as a means of bringing metal and ceramic materials to life. The technical aspect of the inquiry has focused on investigating and testing the compatibility of metal, <b>ceramic</b> and <b>vitreous</b> material to create a new viable, surface finish. This new hybrid surface detail enabled me to create a strong, textured, surface treatment that may stimulate the viewer&rsquo;s curiosity to pick the object up, sense the weight, and to touch and feel the surface, and through that the form of the conceptual object. Through studio practice, I have explored the work of contemporary enamelling artists {{as well as that of}} artists from a wider art field, specifically sculpture, painting and installation practice. I have examined their approaches to making, use of materials, colour, form, size and proportion in relation to my own research, methods and practice...|$|R
40|$|Grinding and {{polishing}} are important {{steps in the}} production of decorative <b>vitreous</b> <b>ceramic</b> tiles. Different combinations of finishing wheels {{and polishing}} wheels are tested to optimize their selection. The results show that the surface glossiness depends not only on the surface quality before machining, but also on the characteristics of the ceramic tiles as well as the performance of grinding and polishing wheels. The performance of the polishing wheel is the key for a good final surface quality. The surface glossiness after finishing must be above 208 in order to get higher polishing quality because finishing will limit the maximum surface glossiness by polishing. The optimized combination of grinding and polishing wheels for all the steps will achieve shorter machining times and better surface quality. No obvious relationships are found between the hardness of ceramic tiles and surface quality or the wear of grinding wheels; therefore, the hardness of the ceramic tile cannot be used for evaluating its machinability...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} the iron steel bars made on the steel {{production}} industry, among other, depends on the temperature profile during the cooling and solidifying process. A new multipoint high temperature transducer based on the optical power collected {{by a group of}} multimode optical fibers has been developed for measuring the transversal cooling profile. The optic fibers are adequately sheathed by a ceramic mixture in order to achieve its mechanical and thermal protection. Besides in order to use the transducer in pollution environments, the probe is putted inside of a close chamber with a window made with a <b>vitreous</b> <b>ceramic</b> material. The use of silica fiber optic limits the spectral range to analyze, and the measured temperature range. The behavior of the transducer from the angle, the distance and the change of emissivity have been measured, and the transducer has been optimized.

40|$|A tri-axial ceramic or Porcelain can {{be defined}} as a glazed or {{unglazed}} <b>vitreous</b> <b>ceramic</b> body made by porcelain process, and used for technical purposes when they are vitreous. Porcelain is distinguished from other whitewares {{because of the lack of}} open pores. Porcelain possess properties such as high strength, toughness, low permeability, translucency etc. which makes porcelain useful in various fields of applications such as electrical, mechanical, chemical, structural fields. All these properties possessed by porcelain comes mainly from the mullite and the glassy phase present in the system. Earlier studies showed that by the addition of mineralizing agents or additives, the reaction rates and the phase formations can be varied. Also most of the transition metal oxide additives showed a higher affinity towards the mullite incorporation and enhancing reaction rates. To the best of our knowledge, there was not much literatures available on the effect of transition metal oxides such as Cr 2 O 3, CoO and NiO incorporation in tri-axial systems. Hence the effect of these oxides on the physical and mechanical properties together with phase formation was studied by preparing porcelain batches containing different additive percentages and fired at temperatures 1100 oC, 1200 oC and 1300 oC. It was observed that Cr 2 O 3 because of its refractory nature does not help during the reaction stages and hence deterioration of properties was observed, whereas CoO, and NiO enhances the reactions by regulating the viscosity of the melt at certain conditions. These reactions lead to increased secondary mullitization and hence advances in properties such as bulk density, porosity and also mechanical properties obtained. Hence transition metal oxides like CoO and NiO can be used further for applications in different fields requiring higher strength and densities...|$|E
