50|$|In the {{original}} calculation, gauge anomalies, mixed anomalies, and gravitational anomalies {{were expected to}} arise from a hexagon Feynman diagram. For the special choice of the gauge group SO(32) or E8 x E8, however, the anomaly factorizes and may be cancelled by a tree diagram. In string theory, this indeed occurs. The tree diagram describes the exchange of a <b>virtual</b> <b>quantum</b> of the B-field. It is somewhat counterintuitive to see that a tree diagram cancels a one-loop diagram, but in reality, both of these diagrams arise as one-loop diagrams in superstring theory in which the anomaly cancellation is more transparent.|$|E

40|$|The {{relativistic}} effect of energy increase in a particle freely moving in vacuum is discussed {{on the basis}} of quantum field theory and probability theory using some ideas of super-symmetrical theories. The particle is assumed to consist of a "seed" whose energy is equal to the particle rest energy and whose pulse is equal to the product of the particle mass by its velocity and of a "fur coat" - the system of <b>virtual</b> <b>quanta</b> of the material field - vacuum. Each of these quanta possesses the same energy and pulse as the "seed" but have no mass. The system of the quanta is in a state being the superposition of quantum states with energies and pulses multiple of the "seed" energy and pulse. The <b>virtual</b> <b>quanta</b> is created (or destroyed) in of such states. The probability of creating a quanta in any state is the inverse of the relativistic factor, and the average number of the quanta making up the "fur coat" with a "seed" is equal to this particular factor.

40|$|A {{quantum network}} {{promises}} to enable long distance quantum communication, and assemble small quantum devices {{into a large}} quantum computing cluster. Each network node can thereby {{be seen as a}} small few qubit quantum computer. Qubits can be sent over direct physical links connecting nearby quantum nodes, or by means of teleportation over pre-established entanglement amongst distant network nodes. Such pre-shared entanglement effectively forms a shortcut - a <b>virtual</b> <b>quantum</b> link - which can be used exactly once. Here, we present an abstraction of a quantum network that allows ideas from computer science to be applied to the problem of routing qubits, and manage entanglement in the network. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which each quantum network node can create EPR pairs with its immediate neighbours over a physical connection, and perform entanglement swapping operations in order to create long distance <b>virtual</b> <b>quantum</b> links. We proceed to discuss the features unique to quantum networks, which call for the development of new routing techniques. As an example, we present two simple hierarchical routing schemes for a quantum network of N nodes for a ring and sphere topology. For these topologies we present efficient routing algorithms requiring O(log N) qubits to be stored at each network node, O(polylog N) time and space to perform routing decisions, and O(log N) timesteps to replenish the <b>virtual</b> <b>quantum</b> links in a model of entanglement generation.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} projected entangled pair state (PEPS) models {{as a framework}} for two-dimensional strongly-correlated quantum many body systems, where the global properties of the system are concisely encoded in one local tensor. While it was well known how to construct PEPS models with desired symmetries by manifestly encoding the symmetry in the local tensor, our goal in this work is to investigate whether this manifestly encoded symmetry can be spontaneously broken. By defining long-range order as a good criterion for symmetry breaking in a finite volume PEPS, we answer this question in the affirmative. A particularly attractive feature of PEPS models is that they have an exact holographic mapping, {{which is to say that}} the large system behavior is described by the ''PEPS boundary'', given by the fixed point(s) of the so called transfer operator. We investigate the implications of long-range order and prove that it leads to a particular symmetry breaking pattern in the fixed point space. We find this pattern by first proving that long-range order implies an asymptotic degeneracy in the transfer operator and then identifying the symmetry breaking mechanism as the one which, from all possible boundary (-matrix) configurations, selects the configurations that correspond to positive-semi-definite matrices, i. e. one-dimensional <b>virtual</b> <b>quantum</b> states. We prove that these correspond to boundary configurations that do not mix under arbitrary perturbations and are thus stable. We study the entanglement properties of these <b>virtual</b> <b>quantum</b> states and show that they can be described by local entanglement Hamiltonians, establishing that also in phases with symmetry breaking, gapped quantum phases have an associated local entanglement Hamiltonian...|$|E

A string hedgehog can be introduced also into the solution. For zero or small hedgehog strength the string gas shell is of a regular nature, while the dual radiation is of a spacelike nature. For higher hedgehog strengths however the radiation "materializes" and becomes timelike while the string gas shell becomes space like. The significance of these solutions for the quantum theory is discussed. Comment: 7 page...|$|E

The monochromatic gamma-ray flux is calculated by assuming supersymmetric neutralino as a typical dark matter candidate. We discuss both the detection focusing on the Galactic center and in a scan mode which detects gamma-rays from the whole Galactic halo are compared.

40|$|Inertial and {{gravitational}} mass or energy-momentum {{need not be}} the same for <b>virtual</b> <b>quantum</b> states. Separating their roles naturally leads to the gauge theory of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of an inner four-dimensional space.

The related Zinn-Justin-type equation restricting the corresponding quantum effective action is established. This equation limits the infinite parts of the quantum effective action to have the same form as the gauge-fixed Lagrangian of the theory proving its spacetime renormalizability. The inner space integrals occurring in the quantum effective action which are divergent due to the gauge group's infinite volume are shown to be regularizable in a way consistent with the symmetries of the theory demonstrating as a byproduct that viable quantum gauge field theories are not limited to finite-dimensional compact gauge groups as is commonly assumed.

40|$|Parity-conserving single-spin asymmetries {{provide a}} {{specific}} measure of coherent spin-orbit dynamics in quantum chromodynamics. The origin of these {{effects can be}} traced to the interplay of chiral dynamics and confinement in the theory. The most elegant display of the relevant mechanisms occurs in the Collins functions and the polarizing fragmentation functions and fracture functions for particles with spin. In the nucleon, these same dynamical mechanisms generate <b>virtual</b> <b>quantum</b> structures leading to the Boer-Mulders functions and orbital distributions. Two complementary formalisms for these distributions appear. The familiar gauge-link formalism incorporates oll nonperturbative dynamics into nonlocal correlators.

The connection between these two approaches can be explored in the process dependence of single-spin asymmetries in various hard-scattering processes.
