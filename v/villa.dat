5|$|Aston <b>Villa</b> {{won their}} sixth FA Cup in 1920. For the {{remainder}} of the inter-war years though, <b>Villa</b> were on a slow decline that would lead to them being relegated to the Second Division in 1936 {{for the first time in}} their history. They returned to the top-tier of English football by the outbreak of the Second World War. As with many clubs, the war brought much change to <b>Villa</b> Park and remainder of the 1940s were spent rebuilding the team. By 1957, <b>Villa</b> were a Cup winning side once again with the clubs seventh FA Cup win. Even though <b>Villa</b> won the inaugural League Cup in 1960, the club were to enter into a very unsuccessful period. The 1960s saw much change at <b>Villa</b> Park. By the end of the 1960s, <b>Villa</b> were languishing in the Second Division and fan pressure led to the resignation of the Board and the introduction of Doug Ellis as <b>Villa</b> Chairman.|$|E

5|$|<b>Villa</b> {{began the}} 20th century as champions but the gap that {{distinguished}} {{them from their}} competitors was diminishing. Football in England was becoming more competitive as more teams formed. <b>Villa</b> did remain a significant force in the game though. Despite a run of four victories {{at the start of}} the 1900–01 season, <b>Villa</b> finished fourth from bottom. In the 1902–03 season <b>Villa</b> won 12 of their last 15 games to finish only one point behind champions Sheffield Wednesday. In 1905, <b>Villa</b> won the FA Cup with a then record crowd of 101,117 watching the match at Crystal Palace, where <b>Villa</b> beat Newcastle United 2–0. In the same season, <b>Villa</b> finished fourth and this helped to boost the coffers at the club. After the success of 1905, <b>Villa</b> went through a barren patch and it was not until the 1909–10 season that <b>Villa</b> threatened to regain the title. In that season, they beat the reigning champions Manchester United 7–1. <b>Villa</b> won the championship for the first time in 10 years to take a then record, sixth title. The 1910–11 season was very close and the title was decided on the last day of the season when <b>Villa</b> lost to Liverpool and Manchester United beat Sunderland to take the title. The following season, <b>Villa</b> finished sixth. Yet in 1913, <b>Villa</b> won the FA Cup for a then record-equalling fifth time. By the end of what was to be called Villa's golden era, when the First World War began, the club had won the League Championship six times and the FA Cup five times. This included the League and Cup Double in 1896–97, a feat which would not be repeated for more than 60 years.|$|E
