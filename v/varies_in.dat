5|$|Stars {{can also}} vary in {{luminosity}} because of extrinsic factors, such as eclipsing binaries, {{as well as}} rotating stars that produce extreme starspots. A notable example of an eclipsing binary is Algol, which regularly <b>varies</b> <b>in</b> magnitude from 2.3 to 3.5 {{over a period of}} 2.87 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field also <b>varies</b> <b>in</b> time and location. The quasi-periodic 11-year solar cycle {{is the most}} prominent variation in which the number and size of sunspots waxes and wanes.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} {{occurring}} between noon and evening. The specific range of time this encompasses <b>varies</b> <b>in</b> one direction: noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm, but when afternoon ends is dependent on when evening begins, {{for which there is}} no standard definition. However, before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pm—possible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along which one concept of noon was defined—and so afternoon would have referred to a narrower timeframe.|$|E

5|$|Algol (from the Arabic رأس الغول Ra's al-Ghul, {{which means}} The Demon's Head), also {{known by its}} Bayer {{designation}} Beta Persei, is the best-known star in Perseus. Representing {{the eye of the}} Gorgon Medusa in Greek mythology, it was called Horus in Egyptian mythology and Rosh ha Satan ("Satan's Head") in Hebrew. Located 92.8 light-years from Earth, it <b>varies</b> <b>in</b> apparent magnitude from a minimum of 3.5 to a maximum of 2.3 over a period of 2.867 days.|$|E
5|$|Glycocalyx is {{produced}} by many bacteria to surround their cells, and <b>varies</b> <b>in</b> structural complexity: ranging from a disorganised slime layer of extracellular polymeric substances to a highly structured capsule. These structures can protect cells from engulfment by eukaryotic cells such as macrophages (part of the human immune system). They can also act as antigens and be involved in cell recognition, as well as aiding attachment to surfaces {{and the formation of}} biofilms.|$|E

5|$|The {{material}} {{formed in}} the Acheson furnace <b>varies</b> <b>in</b> purity, according to its distance from the graphite resistor heat source. Colorless, pale yellow and green crystals have the highest purity and are found closest to the resistor. The color changes to blue and black at greater distance from the resistor, and these darker crystals are less pure. Nitrogen and aluminium are common impurities, and they affect the electrical conductivity of SiC.|$|E
5|$|Various {{scenes in}} the series also show {{existing}} tension between {{the upper and lower}} classes. Anatoray's nobility and military officers generally believe that commoners do not understand their codes of chivalry. On the other hand, the lower class also despise the aristocracy for their monopoly on resources. This tension extends to the accessibility of clean water, which <b>varies</b> <b>in</b> price according to purity grades. In the larger story, the advanced Guild society is portrayed as degenerate and lazy, while the people of Anatoray and Disith are creative and industrious.|$|E
5|$|Also called Aludra, Eta Canis Majoris is a blue-white supergiant of {{spectral}} type B5Ia with a luminosity 176,000 {{times and}} diameter around 80 {{times that of}} the Sun. Classified as an Alpha Cygni type variable star, Aludra <b>varies</b> <b>in</b> brightness from magnitude 2.38 to 2.48 over a period of 4.7 days. It is located 1120 light-years away. To the west of Adhara lies 3.0-magnitude Zeta Canis Majoris or Furud, around 362 light-years distant from Earth. It is a spectroscopic binary, whose components orbit each other every 1.85 years, the combined spectrum indicating a main star of spectral type B2.5V.|$|E

5|$|Although fainter {{than its}} {{northern}} counterpart, the oval- or horseshoe-shaped pattern of its brighter stars renders it distinctive. Alpha and Beta Coronae Australis {{are the two}} brightest stars with an apparent magnitude of around 4.1. Epsilon Coronae Australis is the brightest example of a W Ursae Majoris variable in the southern sky. Lying alongside the Milky Way, Corona Australis contains one of the closest star-forming regions to the Solar System—a dusty dark nebula known as the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, lying about 430 light years away. Within it are stars at the earliest stages of their lifespan. The variable stars R and TY Coronae Australis light up parts of the nebula, which <b>varies</b> <b>in</b> brightness accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria is a {{cosmopolitan}} mushroom, native to conifer and deciduous woodlands throughout the temperate and boreal {{regions of the}} Northern Hemisphere, including higher elevations of warmer latitudes in regions such as Hindu Kush, the Mediterranean and also Central America. A recent molecular study proposes that it had an ancestral origin in the Siberian–Beringian region in the Tertiary period, before radiating outwards across Asia, Europe and North America. The season for fruiting <b>varies</b> <b>in</b> different climates: fruiting occurs in summer and autumn across most of North America, but later in autumn and early winter on the Pacific coast. This species is often found in similar locations to Boletus edulis, and may appear in fairy rings. Conveyed with pine seedlings, it has been widely transported into the southern hemisphere, including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and South America, {{where it can be}} found in the southern Brazilian states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} field generally <b>varies</b> <b>in</b> space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own {{electric field}} disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E

5|$|Cotton was domesticated in India by 4000 BCE. Traditional Indian dress <b>varies</b> <b>in</b> colour {{and style}} across regions and depends on various factors, {{including}} climate and faith. Popular styles of dress include draped garments {{such as the}} sari for women and the dhoti or lungi for men. Stitched clothes, such as the shalwar kameez for women and kurta–pyjama combinations or European-style trousers and shirts for men, are also popular. Use of delicate jewellery, modelled on real flowers worn in ancient India, {{is part of a}} tradition dating back some 5,000 years; gemstones are also worn in India as talismans.|$|E
5|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} and most highly mineralized {{substance}} of the body. It {{is one of the}} four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and dental pulp. It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel <b>varies</b> <b>in</b> thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. The wear rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors.|$|E
5|$|In non-breeding plumage, the {{nominate}} has greyish-black upper parts, cap, nape, and hindneck, {{with the}} colour {{on the upper}} portion of the latter being contained in a vertical stripe. The dark colour of the cap reaches below the eye and can be seen, diffused, to the ear-coverts. Behind the ear-coverts {{on the sides of}} the neck, there are white ovals. The rest of the neck is grey to brownish-grey in colour and has white that <b>varies</b> <b>in</b> amount. The breast is white, and the abdomen is whitish. The flanks are coloured in a mix of blackish-grey with white flecks. The colour of the bill when not breeding differs from that of the breeding plumage, with the former being significantly more grey.|$|E
