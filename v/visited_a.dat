5|$|In {{at least}} some species, once a {{bumblebee}} has <b>visited</b> <b>a</b> flower, it leaves a scent mark on it. This scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the scent degrades. This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations (e.g. nest, neutral, and food sites), and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers, and {{may be able to}} identify who else has <b>visited</b> <b>a</b> flower. Bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time, that is, where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the flower.|$|E
5|$|Abum tells another story, {{which he}} {{believes}} shows that mankind no longer needs demonic temptation to be damned. Abum followed an everyman figure called Brock, watching his grindingly repetitive life. Brock <b>visited</b> <b>a</b> strip club often but without joy, which led Abum {{to believe he}} no longer took pleasure from sinning. One day, Abum added an additional irritation to Brock's life, posing as a traffic warden and giving him a ticket. This was enough to drive Brock to suicide. However, during this time, Abum also encountered Black, who again saw his demonic nature.|$|E

40|$|Hunter (2006) {{states that}} the image of a {{shopping}} centre is one of the factors that may increase the frequency of visits. In addition, the anticipated emotion that the customers experience during shopping is also a variable that influences the frequency of visits. The customers that have emotional relationship with a shopping centre have a higher desire to visit the related shopping centre. The customers’ higher desire to visit the shopping centre will influence the increasing intention to <b>visit</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre and will positively contribute to the frequency (the number) of customers’ <b>visits</b> to <b>a</b> shopping centre. The research was conducted in Yogyakarta, namely to the customers who visited Plaza Ambarrukmo Yogyakarta. The objectives that the researcher would like to investigate were the role of anticipated emotion in mediating the influence of shopping centre image to the desire of visiting the shopping centre, the influence of <b>a</b> desire to <b>visit</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre to the intention of <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre, the influence of <b>an</b> intention to <b>visit</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre to the frequency of <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre, and the difference of customers’ evaluation toward the shopping centre’s image, the anticipated emotion, the intention to <b>visit</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre and the frequency of <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre between men and women. The results of the research conducted to the customers of Plaza Ambarrukmo Yogyakarta Shopping Centre provides a hard evidence that the shopping centre’s image, the anticipated emotion, the desire of <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre and the intention of <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre influence positively and significantly the increase of customers’ visits to Plaza Ambarrukmo Yogyakarta. Anticipated emotion is a mediation variable from the relationship between the shopping centre image and the intention of <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre...|$|R

5|$|Diocletian was in Antioch in {{the autumn}} of 302, when the next {{instance}} of persecution occurred.
