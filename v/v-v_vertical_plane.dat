40|$|A novel error-aware visual {{localization}} {{method is}} proposed that utilizes <b>vertical</b> <b>planes,</b> such as <b>vertical</b> building facades {{in urban areas}} as landmarks. <b>Vertical</b> <b>planes,</b> reconstructed from coplanar vertical lines, are robust high-level features if compared with point features or line features. Firstly, the error models of vertical lines and <b>vertical</b> <b>planes</b> are built, where maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is employed to estimate all <b>vertical</b> <b>planes</b> from coplanar <b>vertical</b> lines. Then, the closed-form representation of camera location error variance is derived. Finally, the minimum variance camera pose estimation is formulated into a convex optimization problem, and the weight for each <b>vertical</b> <b>plane</b> is obtained by solving this well-studied problem. Experiments are carried out and {{the results show that}} the proposed localization method has an accuracy of about 2 meters, at par with commercial GPS operating in open environments...|$|R

50|$|In the {{three-dimensional}} case, {{the situation is}} more complicated as now one has horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>planes</b> in addition to horizontal and vertical lines. Consider a point P and designate a direction through P as <b>vertical.</b> A <b>plane</b> which contains P and is normal to the designated direction is the horizontal plane at P. Any plane going through P, normal to the horizontal <b>plane</b> is a <b>vertical</b> <b>plane</b> at P. Through any point P, there is one and only one horizontal plane but a multiplicity of <b>vertical</b> <b>planes.</b> This is a new feature that emerges in three dimensions. The symmetry {{that exists in the}} two-dimensional case no longer holds.|$|R

40|$|The {{acceptance}} of the KEK booster has large side value (272 π mm mrad in the horizontal plane and 61 π mm mrad in the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane).</b> To increase the beam intensity we {{have been trying to}} achieve painting injection in the horizontal plane. The intensity-dependent emittance-exchanges in the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>plane</b> were measured by a method using a scraper and bump magnets method. In order to clarify the experimental results, multi-particle tracking was performed with self-consistent space-charge forces. The experimental and simulation results imply that a space-charge potential of a beam-induced coupling exists between the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>planes.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The body-specificity {{hypothesis}} (BSH) {{predicts that}} right-handers and left-handers allocate {{positive and negative}} concepts differently on the horizontal plane, i. e., while left-handers allocate negative concepts {{on the right-hand side}} of their bodily space, right-handers allocate such concepts to the left-hand side. Similar research shows that people, in general, tend to allocate positive and negative concepts in upper and lower areas, respectively, in relation to the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane.</b> Further research shows a higher salience of the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane</b> over the horizontal plane in the performance of sensorimotor tasks. The aim of the paper is to examine whether there should be a dominance of the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane</b> over the horizontal plane, not only at a sensorimotor level but also at a conceptual level. In Experiment 1, various participants from diverse linguistic backgrounds were asked to rate the words "up", "down", "left", and "right". In Experiment 2, right-handed participants from two linguistic backgrounds were asked to allocate emotion words into a square grid divided into four boxes of equal areas. Results suggest that the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane</b> is more salient than the horizontal plane regarding the allocation of emotion words and positively-valenced words were placed in upper locations whereas negatively-valenced words were placed in lower locations. Together, the results lend support to the BSH while also suggesting a higher saliency of the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane</b> over the horizontal plane in the allocation of valenced words...|$|R

50|$|Most {{broadcast}} antennas {{use either}} line-of-sight or ground wave propagation (a slight refraction towards the ground) {{to reach their}} nearby listeners, and thus want a low angle in the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane.</b> Short wave transmitters want a somewhat higher elevation angle in the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane</b> to encourage skywave propagation, which would refract or reflect radio waves off the ionosphere {{and back to the}} ground at a great distance from the transmitter.|$|R
