40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis is the fineblanking {{technology}} with a <b>vee-ring</b> which {{was chosen as}} the most suitable solution. The aim is a design and an assessment of technologicity of the selected component, a draft of the structural design of the tool and an economic evalua-tion of the project. The chain wheel has been designed from structural steel 11500; parameters have been evaluated as appropriate. The instrument has been designed as two-station progressive tool for single-row layout of the fineblanked parts with a moving punch; the <b>vee-ring</b> is positioned both to the blanking plate and to the <b>vee-ring</b> plate. The press was chosen {{on the basis of the}} calculated shearing force by Feintool Company. At the selected batch 500, 000 units, 5. 1 CZK per fineblanket part has been calculated...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve a more {{intensive}} understanding of the forming mechanism of the fine-blanking process, a numerical simulation {{has been carried out}} by using a mixed displacement/pressure (u/p) finite element method. According to the special requirement of the fine-blanking technique, the major process attributes, such as the <b>vee-ring,</b> the ejector and the edge radii of tools, have been taken into account in the finite element model. The punch-die clearance was set to 0. 5 % of the thickness of the workpiece. To verify the effectiveness of the simulation, the equivalent strain on the sheared surface of a SS 400 steel specimen has been determined experimentally. The experimental values of the equivalent strain have been estimated by measuring the relative displacements of the local grids pre-etched on the meridian plane of the specimen. The results of the finite element simulation are in proper agreement with the experimental findings. The distributions of the shear stress and the equivalent plastic strain have been computed for discussion. Moreover, a diagram of the blanking force versus the punch penetration has also been constructed. In order to investigate the fracture mechanism in the fine-blanking process, the concept of damage mechanics has been applied. By using a void growth model, the evolution of damage at different stages of the fine-blanking has been evaluated. It has been realized that the compressive hydrostatic stress built up by the fine-blanking fixture plays an important role to suppress the initiation of macrocracks.
