40|$|OAK B 204 The {{overall goal}} of this three-year {{research}} project {{was to develop a}} new scientific design of a compact modular 200 MWe and a full size 1200 MWe simplified boiling water reactors (SBWR). Specific objectives of this research were: (1) to perform scientific designs of the core neutronics and core thermal-hydraulics for a small capacity and full size simplified boiling water reactor, (2) to develop a passive safety system design, (3) improve and validate safety analysis code, (4) demonstrate experimentally and analytically all design functions of the safety systems for the design basis accidents (DBA) and (5) to develop the final scientific design of both SBWR systems, 200 MWe (SBWR- 200) and 1200 MWe (SBWR- 1200). The SBWR combines the advantages of design simplicity and completely passive safety systems. These advantages fit well within the objectives of NERI and the Department of Energy's focus on the development of Generation III and IV nuclear power. The 3 -year research program was structured around seven tasks. Task 1 was to perform the preliminary thermal-hydraulic design. Task 2 was to perform the core neutronic design analysis. Task 3 was to perform a detailed scaling study and obtain corresponding PUMA conditions from an integral test. Task 4 was to perform integral tests and code evaluation for the DBA. Task 5 was to perform a safety analysis for the DBA. Task 6 was to perform a BWR stability analysis. Task 7 was to perform a final scientific design of the compact modular SBWR- 200 and the full size SBWR- 1200. A no cost extension for the third year was requested and the request was granted and all the project tasks were completed by April 2003. The design activities in tasks 1, 2, and 3 were completed as planned. The existing thermal-hydraulic information, core physics, and fuel lattice information was collected on the existing design of the simplified boiling water reactor. The thermal-hydraulic design were developed. Based on a detailed integral system scaling analysis, design parameters were obtained and designs of the compact modular 200 MWe SBWR and the full size 1200 MWe SBWR were developed. These reactors are provided with passive safety systems. A new passive <b>vacuum</b> <b>breaker</b> check <b>valve</b> was designed to replace the mechanical vacuum beaker check <b>valve.</b> The new <b>vacuum</b> <b>breaker</b> check <b>valve</b> was based on a hydrostatic head, and was fail safe. The performance of this new valve was evaluated both by the thermal-hydraulic code RELAP 5 and by the experiments in a scaled SBWR facility, PUMA. In the core neutronic design a core depletion model was implemented to PARCS code. A lattice design for the SBWR fuel assemblies was performed. Design improvements were made to the neutronics/thermal-hydraulics models of SBWR- 200 and SBWR- 1200, and design analyses of these reactors were performed. The design base accident analysis and evaluation of all the passive safety systems were completed as scheduled in tasks 4 and 5. Initial conditions for the small break loss of coolant accidents (LOCA) and large break LOCA using REALP 5 code were obtained. Small and large break LOCA tests were performed and the data was analyzed. An anticipated transient with scram was simulated using the RELAP 5 code for SBWR- 200. The transient considered was an accidental closure of the main steam isolation valve (MSIV), which was considered to be the most significant transient. The evaluation of the RELAP 5 code against experimental data for SBWR- 1200 was completed. In task 6, the instability analysis for the three SBWR designs (SBWR- 1200, SBWR- 600 and SBWR- 200) were simulated for start-up transients and the results were similar. Neither the geysering instability, nor the loop type instability was predicted by RAMONA- 4 B in the startup simulation following the recommended procedure by GE. The density wave oscillation was not observed at all because the power level used in the simulation was not high enough. A study was made of the potential instabilities by imposing an unrealistically high power ramp in a short time period, as suggested by GE.

40|$|The {{function}} of the suppression-chamber-to-drywell <b>vacuum</b> <b>breakers</b> is to relieve vacuum in the drywell. There are four <b>vacuum</b> <b>breakers</b> located outside the primary containment which form {{an extension of the}} primary containment boundary. The vacuum relief valves are mounted in special piping between the drywell and the suppression chamber, which allow air and steam flow from the suppression chamber to the drywell when the drywell is at a negative pressure with respect to the suppression chamber. Therefore, suppression chamber-to-drywell <b>vacuum</b> <b>breakers</b> prevent an excessive negative differential pressure across the wetwell drywell boundary. Each <b>vacuum</b> <b>breaker</b> is a self actuating <b>valve</b> with one <b>vacuum</b> <b>breaker</b> in each line. Manual isolation valves are located on each side of each <b>vacuum</b> <b>breaker.</b> A negative differential pressure across the drywell wall is caused by rapid depressurization of the drywell. Events that cause this rapid depressurization are cooling cycles, inadvertent drywell spray actuation, and steam condensation from sprays or subcooled water reflood of a break {{in the event of a}} primary system rupture. Cooling cycles result in minor pressure transients in the drywell that occur slowly and are normally controlled by heating and ventilation equipment. Spray actuation or spill of subcooled water out of a break results in more significant pressure transients and becomes important in sizing the <b>vacuum</b> <b>breakers.</b> In the event of a primary system rupture, steam condensation within the drywell results in the most severe pressure transient. Following a primary system rupture, air in the drywell is purged into the suppression chamber free airspace, leaving the drywell full of steam. Subsequent condensation of the steam can be caused in two possible ways, namely, Emergency Core Cooling Systems flow from a recirculation line break, or drywell spray actuation following a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). These two cases determine the maximum depressurization rate of the drywell...|$|R

In this report <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> in small-scale hydropower stations with {{the rated power}} 4 MVA and below has been studied. Models of the stations are modeled and analyzed in PSCAD/EMTDC to study the high voltage transients that are created after current chopping with <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker.</b> <b>Vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> may chop the current before it reaches zero value, which means that high voltage transients can be created. The equipment of the stations can be destroyed by high voltage transients. The purpose of this thesis {{is to examine the}} use of <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> in small-scale hydropower stations and the risk for high voltage transients from current chopping. According to the results there is a risk of high voltage transients after current chopping with small synchronous generators in stations with the operating voltages 0. 4 kV and 3. 6 kV. When the <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> is placed on the high voltage side of the transformer the risk increases of high voltages transients and reignitions due to the low capacitance of the transformer. The conclusions is that high voltage transients occurs when the <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> chops the current at a high chopping level in stations where the synchronous generator rated power is low, high rated voltage and a small capacitance.

40|$|Abstract—Winding {{failures}} in induction machines {{have been a}} major concern in the past several years, and more so recently with the addition of variable speed drives (VSDs). Both the introduction of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>breaker,</b> and the use of pulse width modulation (PWM) drives, utilizing fast switching IGBT’s, have resulted in an increase in winding {{failures in}} induction machines. Two mechanisms that cause winding failures are steep-fronted surges, like those caused during the opening and closing of <b>vacuum</b> <b>breakers,</b> and transient overvoltages caused by impedance mismatch between the cable and load during VSD operation. There has been a fair amount of work done to date on the propagation of <b>vacuum</b> <b>breaker</b> induced steep-fronted surges in the windings of the induction machine. More recently, work has been progressing on overvoltages at the machine terminals as a result of VSD’s operating with long cables connecting drive and machine. However the propagation of these surges down the coils and the interference of these PWM surges with each other in the coils as well as the coupling between turns and coils have not been thoroughly investigated. Such an investigation would allow more benign PWM strategies to be developed, which do not build up in the machine to unacceptably high levels. To this end, this paper presents a measurement technique which can be used to study PWM generated surges and their propagation within the coil, considering each turn at a time. This requires the inclusion of the differences in the surge impedances in each section of the coil. Detailed parameter measurements are made of each turn section (slot vs. overhang), which are then used to determine the surge impedance of each section. Reflection and refraction coefficients are calculated, then used to map, via lattice diagrams, the propagation of surges within the turns of one coil...|$|R

Though beryllium has many excellent physical properties and poses minimal to no human health hazard when in a solid finished form, inhaling the dust or fumes of beryllium containing materials can cause serious health issues. This project assesses whether removable beryllium surface contamination is present on four different types of electrical switchgear equipment.

40|$|The vacuum {{switching}} technology is preferred {{used in the}} medium voltage level due to its high reliability, {{the high number of}} switching operations, its free-maintenance as well as its long term durability. Contrary to gas-insulated switches, the contact surface of a <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> has a substantial influence on the withstand voltage. Charge carriers, escaped from the contacts due to an electrical field stress, will be accelerated in the contact gap, whereas the absorbed energy could not be reduced significantly, because of the marginal number of collisions. Caused by the impact on the contact surface, additional charge carriers may be generated with a subsequent breakdown. The required withstand voltage of a <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> is reached by a conditioning of the metallic surfaces inside the <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker.</b> A mechanical handling alone is not sufficient. All established procedures for conditioning <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breakers</b> to reach a required withstand voltage use current limited breakdowns to remove emission centers which are the origin of a breakdown. In this work, a conditioning process for industrial type <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breakers</b> is investigated, using high-frequency currents in the kHz-range. Due to high current rises before and high voltage rises after a current interruption during a current zero crossing, a reignition of a vacuum insulation can be enforced.

It is investigated, to what extend the voltage and current distribution, measured during a high frequency conditioning process, can be used to specify the reached lightning impulse withstand voltage. The conditioning process is successful only, if every critical emission centre is removed. Therefore the spatial distribution of the arcs is an important information for the evaluation of the conditioning process. Here, a circuit breaker model is used for optical investigations of the conditioning arcs.
