30|$|Three {{cases of}} {{secondary}} bleeding of the vaginal incision required these patients to be readmitted to the hospital. This type of bleeding {{occurred during the}} period in which we used “Vicryl Rapide” 00 for closure of the vagina, which was a mistake: Two of these cases required a repeat of the vaginal suture under general anesthetic on the 18 th and 21 st days, respectively, whereas the third case required only a <b>vaginal</b> <b>tampon.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Vaginal</b> <b>tampons</b> {{were shown}} to be a {{practical}} alternative to conventional Moore swabs for isolating Vibrio cholerae from sewage.

40|$|Six {{components}} used in <b>vaginal</b> <b>tampons</b> {{were tested}} for {{their effects on}} a strain of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated from a patient with disseminated infection. Tampon components containing carboxymethyl cellulose or its derivative prolonged the in-vitro survival of gonococci and, when injected with mucin into mice, significantly (P less than 0. 0001) increased the dissemination of gonococci from the peritoneal cavity. In contrast, a component extracted from rayon tampons reduced in-vitro survival and appeared to suppress gonococcal dissemination in mice. Since tampons are used by {{a large number of}} women {{at a time when the}} risk of developing complications from venereal infections are increased, their effects on potential urogenital pathogens warrant further study...|$|R
40|$|Self-inserted <b>vaginal</b> <b>tampons</b> for the {{molecular}} diagnosis of non-ulcerative STIs were evaluated. Cervical and <b>vaginal</b> swabs, <b>tampons</b> and urines {{were collected from}} 185 first-time antenatal clinic attendees. Cultures and nucleic acid amplification assays (NAA) were performed. The sensitivity of PCR on tampons for Trichomonas vaginalis was with 94 % (CI 85 - 98 %) significantly higher (P< 0. 001) than culture (50 %, CI 38 - 62 %) or urine (53 %, CI 41 - 65 %). Neisseria gonorrhoeae culture had a sensitivity of 64 % (CI 36 - 86 %), strand displacement assay (SDA) had a sensitivity of 79 % (CI 49 - 94 %) using tampon specimens, 57 % (CI 30 - 81 %) using endocervical swabs and 43 % (CI 19 - 70 %) using urines. There {{was no difference in}} sensitivity of SDA for Chlamydia trachomatis using tampon specimens, urine or endocervical swabs. The specificity approached 100 % for all assays on all specimens. NAA on tampons for the detection of T. vaginalis, N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis identified more infections than assays on swabs or urines. This reached statistical significance for T. vaginalis only...|$|R
40|$|Medical {{technology}} {{often has}} unforeseen effects on human health. For example, indwelling urethral catheters promote gram-negative endotoxin shock, and improved absorbency in tampons triggered {{an epidemic of}} toxic shock syndrome. The pessary is an ancient gynecologic device used to support or position a displaced or prolapsed uterus. As an invasive device, similar to a <b>vaginal</b> <b>tampon</b> or contraceptive diaphragm, the pessary may have increased a woman 2 ̆ 7 s risk of vaginal infections, possibly including toxic shock syndrome, especially during the 19 th century when prolapsus uteri was a common diagnosis among young women. Evidence for {{the involvement of the}} pessary in the syndrome is drawn from early medical texts that attribute toxic-shock-type symptoms, specifically high or fatal fevers, to absorbent pessaries. Further evidence comes from the culture of Staphylococcus aureus from nonabsorbent pessaries...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcal toxic shock {{syndrome}} (STSS) is a rare, potentially lethal infection, with a clinical picture of multiple organ dysfunction and shock. The etiology is Staphylococcus aureus exotoxin, while enterotoxins act as superantigens. Most cases are identified in women using a <b>vaginal</b> <b>tampon.</b> A 51 -year-old female, with a past medical history of biliary dyskinesia, {{presented in the}} emergency room complaining of sudden onset of abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, myalgia, and chills. The initial diagnosis was biliary colic and was treated parenterally with Amoxi-clavulanate and fluid replacement. Initially, progress was unsatisfactory. Four days after admission she developed a systemic inflammatory syndrome, diffuse rash, jaundice, oliguria, confusion, persistent hypotension and biological evidence of thrombocytopenia, nitrogen retention, and cholestasis. She was admitted to the intensive care unit. A gluteal phlegmon induced after intramuscular injections was identified and surgically treated. Blood bacteriological cultures were negative, though MRSA was isolated in phlegmon pus. A diagnosis of STSS was based on CDC criteria...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Concurrent {{infection}} with HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV) in women {{is associated with}} increased rates of cervical dysplasia and shorter survival following the development of cervical cancer. The authors examined risk factors for HPV infection at study entry in HIV-positive women enrolled in the Canadian Women's HIV Study, a prospective open cohort study. METHODS: Subjects eligible for this analysis included the 375 HIV-positive women in the Canadian Women's HIV Study for whom HPV test results were available. Questionnaires on behavioural and clinical information, Pap smears, cervicovaginal lavage specimens and <b>vaginal</b> <b>tampon</b> specimens for HPV detection and typing by polymerase chain reaction were obtained at study entry. RESULTS: Overall, 67. 2 % (252 / 375) {{of the women were}} HPV-positive; the global prevalence of intermediate- and high-risk oncogenic HPV types was 49. 1 % (184 / 375). Women with squamous cell dysplasia (32 / 294) {{were more likely to have}} HPV infection than those without dysplasia (90. 6 % v. 62. 6 %; p = 0. 002). Multivariate logistic regression analysis, with adjustment for number of lifetime partners and history of STD, revealed that the following risk factors were independently associated with HPV infection: CD 4 count of less than 0. 20 x 10 (9) /L (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1. 99 [95 % confidence interval (Cl) 1. 17 - 3. 37 (p = 0. 011) ]), non-white race (adjusted OR 2. 00 [95 % Cl 1. 17 - 3. 42 (p = 0. 011) ]), inconsistent condom use in the 6 months before study entry (adjusted OR 2. 02 [95 % Cl 1. 16 - 3. 50 (p = 0. 013) ]), and lower age, with women age 30 - 39 years (adjusted OR 0. 51 [95 % Cl 0. 30 - 0. 87 (p = 0. 013) ]) and age 40 years or older (adjusted OR 0. 52 [95 % Cl 0. 26 - 1. 01 (p = 0. 052) ]) compared with women less than 30 years of age. INTERPRETATION: Close monitoring for HPV-related effects is warranted in all HIV-positive women, particularly younger, non-white women who do not always use condoms. Counselling for women living with HIV, particularly younger women, should emphasize the importance of regular cytological screening, with increasing frequency as the CD 4 count falls...|$|E
40|$|Different {{brands of}} <b>vaginal</b> <b>tampons</b> varied {{significantly}} (p less than 0. 0001) in their anti-bacterial effects when tested with 46 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Gonococcal strains recovered from patients with disseminated infections were substantially {{more sensitive to}} the anti-bacterial effects of tampons than were strains from patients with uncomplicated genital infections. Strains from patients with pelvic inflammatory disease were moderately sensitive. Tampons showing strong in-vitro antigonococcal effects were also generally effective in vivo in eliminating gonococcal infections from subcutaneous chambers in mice. Extracts of the Rely tampon showed no in-vitro antigonococcal effect, however, but did induce antibacterial activity when injected into subcutaneous chambers in mice. These results emphasise the importance of both in-vitro as well as in-vivo testing of tampon materials to elucidate more fully the nature of their antibacterial effects and their potential for affecting vaginal pathogens and disease processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantitative}} and qualitative changes in the bacterial flora of the vagina during menstruation have received inadequate study. Similarly, the effect of <b>vaginal</b> <b>tampons</b> on the microbial flora {{as well as the}} relationship between the microbial flora of the vagina and that of the tampon has not been adequately evaluated. The purposes of the present study were (i) to develop quantitative methods for studying the vaginal flora and the flora of tampons obtained during menstruation and (ii) to determine whether there were differences between the microflora of the tampon and that of the <b>vaginal</b> vault. <b>Tampon</b> and swab samples were obtained at various times from eight young healthy volunteers for 8 to 10 menstrual cycles. Samples consisted of swabs from women wearing menstrual pads compared with swab and tampon samples taken at various times during the menstrual cycle. Samples were analyzed for total facultative and anaerobic bacterial counts, and the six dominant bacterial species in each culture were identified. Statistical evaluation of the results indicates that total bacterial counts decreased during menstruation and that swab and tampon samples yielded similar total counts per unit weight of sample. The numbers of bacteria in tampons tended to be lower than in swabs taken at the same time. Overall, during menstruation, the concentrations of lactobacilli declined, but otherwise there was little difference among the species found during menstruation compared with those found in intermenstrual samples. Cotton tampons had little discernible effect on the microbial flora...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the aetiology of FDG uptake in <b>vaginal</b> <b>tampons</b> (VT), a known artefact in premenopausal women evaluated by PET/CT. METHODS: This Institutional Review Board approved study consisted of retrospective and prospective parts. The retrospective analysis included 685 women examined between January 2008 and December 2009 regarding VT presence. PET/CT images were analysed to determine the localization and the standardized uptake value (SUV) of VTs. We prospectively recruited 24 women (20 - 48 years old) referred for staging or follow-up in an oncology setting between February and April 2010, who were provided a commercial VT to be used during the entire examination after obtaining written informed consent. After image acquisition, VTs were individually analysed for creatinine concentration and blood traces. Statistical significance was tested with the Mann-Whitney U test.

40|$|The {{effects of}} tampon composition, {{inoculum}} size, and simulated menses on production of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-I) and toxic shock syndrome (TSS) were evaluated in a rabbit model that simulates tampon use in humans. Three small generic compressed-fiber tampons were successively inserted vaginally (remained in place 4. 5 hours X 2; over-night x I). Tampon no. 1 was inoculated with live TSST-l-positive staphylococci plus 5 mL of saline or simulated menses (defibrinated rabbit blood plus 2. 5 g of bovine serum albumin/dL) immediately after insertion; saline or simulated menses alone were used with tampons no. 2 and 3. The vagina was washed after removal of tampon no. 3. TSS-like illness was produced consistently in animals with carboxymethyl cellulose/polyester foam tampons, which supported higher organism counts and greater TSST-I production in as-sociation with subsequent tampons. Cotton and rayon tampons were {{not associated with}} as much clinical illness, organism growth, or TSST-I production. Simulated menses sup-ported toxin production and clinical illness when the inoculum was one-tenth that re-quired for controls. Sham tampon insertion was associated with TSS-like illness in two of 10 rabbits; thus, other factors may promote TSS {{in the absence of}} <b>vaginal</b> <b>tampons...</b>|$|R
40|$|Although {{the effect}} of <b>vaginal</b> <b>tampons</b> on the {{microbial}} flora during menstruation has recently been studied by several investigators, quantitative effects attributable to particular tampon fibers have received less attention. The purposes {{of the present study}} were (i) to determine and then to compare the effects of polyacrylate rayon tampons and viscose rayon tampons on the normal vaginal flora, (ii) to compare quantitative bacterial counts obtained from these tampons with those obtained from concomitant vaginal swabs, and (iii) to determine whether either of these tampon types alters the vaginal microflora when compared with the microflora in the same women using all-cotton tampons or external catamenial pads. Tampon and swab samples were obtained at predetermined times from 18 women for an average of seven menstrual cycles. Samples consisting of swabs from women wearing menstrual pads were compared with swab and tampon samples taken at predetermined times during the menstrual cycle from women using cotton, polyacrylate rayon, or viscose rayon tampons. Samples were analyzed for total aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic bacterial counts. Statistical evaluation of the results indicated that, on the whole, total bacterial counts decreased during menstruation and that the numbers of bacteria in tampons tended to be lower than those in swab samples taken at the same time.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>vaginal</b> <b>tampons</b> on the {{microbial}} flora during menstruation {{has recently been}} studied by several investigators. However, little information regarding the qualitative effects attributable to particular tampon fibers is available. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to compare the effects of polyacrylate rayon tampons and cotton-viscose rayon blend tampons on the qualitative bacterial counts obtained from <b>tampons</b> and concomitant <b>vaginal</b> swabs and to determine whether either of these tampon types alters the qualitative makeup of the vaginal microflora when compared with the microflora in the same women using all-cotton tampons or external catamenial pads. Tampon and swab samples were obtained as described previously (A. B. Onderdonk, G. R. Zamarchi, M. L. Rodriguez, M. L. Hirsch, A. Muñoz, and E. H. Kass, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 53 : 2774 - 2778). The genus and species of the six dominant bacterial species in each sample were identified, if possible. A statistical evaluation of the qualitative makeup of the microflora revealed that the same numerically dominant phenotypes were present regardless of sample type, sample time, or catamenial product. Predictable changes in total numbers among the dominant species were also noted when the data were evaluated by day of menstrual cycle. The correlation between the total numbers of each dominant species present was evaluated by day of cycle, and the findings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Recurrent vulvovaginal {{candidiasis}} is relatively frequent condition, {{and may have}} serious health consequences, like chronic vulvovaginal pain syndrome. The aim of our {{study was to determine}} possible risk factors for recurrent {{vulvovaginal candidiasis}} in non-pregnant females within the reproductive age. Methods. The design of our study was of a case-control type. Case and control patients were selected from the gynecological patients at six primary care facilities in Serbia and in Montenegro. The data on the patients' health condition, concomitant therapy and diseases were taken from their records, and the data on habits were obtained by unstructured interview. For potential risk factors crude odds ratios were calculated, and then adjusted by logistic regression. Results. A total of fifty-one patients had four or more episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis during the last year (cases), and 132 patients with one to three episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis were sampled as controls, matched by age. The only two significant associations were found between recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and continual wearing of panty liners during the last year (Odds ratio - ORadjusted: 3. 97; confidence interval - CI: 1. 57 - 10. 02; p = 0. 004), and between recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and predominant use of <b>vaginal</b> <b>tampons</b> during menstruation in the last year (ORadjusted: 4. 25; CI: 1. 11 - 16. 27; p = 0. 035). The synergistic effect was observed for the concurrent continual wearing of panty liners during the last year and selfmedication with antimycotics. Conclusions. Local factors, like wearing of panty liners or use of tampons during menstruation, may promote recurrence of vulvovaginal candidiasis, especially in patients who practice selfmedication with antimycotics...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{synthetic}} progestagens released by vaginal devices {{is an important}} tool to overcome the reproductive seasonality in sheep, but cost and/or subsequent vaginitis are limiting factors for their use. To identify economic, simple and innocuous alternative vaginal devices for estrous synchronization/induction protocols in sheep, this study aimed to evaluate the microbiological and functional viability of the human <b>vaginal</b> <b>tampons</b> (OB®) impregnated with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP) on reproductive performance of ewes. The study compared them with commercial vaginal inserts (CIDR®) and polyurethane sponges impregnated with MAP. In Experiment 1, the device loss rate, the degree of vaginitis during the device removal, the count and identification of bacterial colonies at the device insertion and removal, and efficiency in estrous synchronization and estrus temporal distribution were evaluated. Pubertal ewes {{at the beginning of}} the breeding season were randomly allocated to three experimental groups: CIDR®, PSP (polyurethane sponge) and OB®. No device losses occurred in any group, but the use of OB® caused milder signs of vaginitis than polyurethane sponges, with a similar vaginal bacterial growth and microbiota than the CIDR group. The estrus distribution was more disperse in the CIDR than PSP or OB groups. In Experiment 2, pregnancy rates using CIDR® or OB® devices were compared, with estrus manifestation (85. 4 % and 89. 8 %) and pregnancy rates (58. 3 % and 49. 0 %) being similar between groups (P> 0. 05), respectively. In conclusion, the use of human intra-vaginal tampons (OB®) impregnated with MAP was proven highly hygienic, practical and effective as a low-cost alternative for estrous synchronization and AI in sheep...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{feminine}} {{products such as}} <b>vaginal</b> douches, <b>tampons,</b> and sanitary napkins are common among women. Despite the results of some studies that suggest an association between douching and bacterial vaginosis, douching remains a topic that is understudied. The possibility of an association between tampon use and infection has not been significantly investigated since the toxic shock outbreak in the 1980 s. The first objective of our study was to evaluate demographic, reproductive health, and sexual behavior variables to establish an epidemiologic profile of menstruating women who reported douching and women who reported using sanitary napkins only. The second objective of our study was to evaluate whether the behaviors of douching and using tampons were {{associated with an increased}} risk of bacterial vaginosis or trichomonas. We analyzed these factors, using logistic regression, among the 3, 174 women from the NHANES cross sectional data from 2001 - 2004, who met the inclusion criteria determined for our study. We established an epidemiologic profile for women who had the highest frequency of douching reported as women who were age 36 - 49, had a high school education or GED, black race, not taking oral contraceptives, reported vaginal symptoms in the last month, two or more sexual partners in the last year, or tested positive for bacterial vaginosis or trichomonas. The profile for those who had the highest frequency of exclusive sanitary napkin use included women with less than a high school education, married women, women classified as black or 2 ̆ 2 other 2 ̆ 2 in race, and women who were not on oral contraceptives. While we were able to establish {{a significant increase in the}} odds of douching among women who tested positive for bacterial vaginosis or trichomonas, we did not find any significant difference in the odds of exclusive napkin use and testing negative for bacterial vaginosis or trichomonas. ...|$|R
