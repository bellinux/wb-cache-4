40|$|During {{the last}} decade, power quality has been {{recognised}} asa global problem. Among {{different types of}} power qualityproblems, <b>voltage</b> <b>sags</b> have been identified {{to be one of}} themost severe problems for different process industries. The mostcommon reason to <b>voltage</b> <b>sags</b> is lightning strikes in powerlines. Protection equipment, usually located at switchyards,disconnect faulted power lines as soon as possible, which isapproximately 100 ms. Thus, the duration of <b>voltage</b> <b>sags</b> areapproximately 100 ms. The sensitivity to <b>voltage</b> <b>sags</b> ofelectrical equipment in process industries can be observed asfor instance malfunction, automatic turnoff or damages. This thesis gives an overview of three metals processes withfocus on the sensitivity to <b>voltage</b> <b>sags</b> and interruptions. Theinherent energy in the process is used to find the sensitivity. This energy may also be used to obtain "ride-through" for theprocesses. The three metals processes are a blast furnaceprocess, a hot rolling mill process and a cold rolling millprocess. The main attention in this thesis is paid to the blastfurnace process, which is powered by a line-operatedsynchronous machine. The thesis shows that the protection equipment forelectrical machines can be adjusted to avoid unnecessaryshutdowns. It is also explained why there are high torque andcurrents during <b>voltage</b> <b>sags</b> as well as after <b>voltage</b> <b>sags.</b> Itis shown that the first peak torque and current during thevoltage sags is almost proportional to the voltage change, thatis the voltage magnitude before the voltage sag minus thevoltage magnitude during the voltage sag. The first peak torqueand current after the voltage sag depends sinusoidal-like onthe duration of the voltage sag and almost proportional to thevoltage change during the voltage sag. There is no fluxsaturation during <b>voltage</b> <b>sags,</b> however after voltage sagssaturation is very likely to occur. The thesis explains why andalso how the flux is changed during and after <b>voltage</b> <b>sags.</b> The duration of <b>voltage</b> <b>sags</b> is in many cases set by theprotection equipment located in switchyards.

Different equipment have voltage sensitivity thresholds, and when <b>voltage</b> <b>sags</b> are below that specific threshold, they can lead to interruption of supply, and as a result, they will result in financial losses. In this dissertation, the impact of distributed generation (DG) on voltage sag performance is investigated. Using a stochastic approach, voltage sag performance is assessed by using a method of fault position to determine profiles of magnitudes of remaining voltages at a monitoring point. From these, the expected number of critical <b>voltage</b> <b>sags</b> at a monitoring point are calculated, and the expected cost of these sags is derived for various voltage sensitivity threshold limits.

Accurate <b>voltage</b> <b>sag</b> source location can help to minimize the loss and problems caused by <b>voltage</b> <b>sag</b> in a power distribution system. This paper presents a development of a current component index (CCI) algorithm to locate the source of <b>voltage</b> <b>sag</b> in a power distribution system. The product of the RMS current and the power factor angle at the monitoring point is employed for the sag source location. A graph of this product against time is plotted. The <b>voltage</b> <b>sag</b> source location is determined by examining {{the magnitude of the}} current component index {{at the beginning of the}} sag. If the magnitude of the CCI during sag is higher than the magnitude of CCI before sag, it indicates that the <b>voltage</b> <b>sag</b> source is in front of the monitoring point.
