40|$|Abstract—A current {{challenge}} {{faced by}} the electric utility industry is to determine how <b>variable</b> <b>generation</b> plants (wind and solar) should contribute to the reliable operation of the electric grid, especially as penetration of these resources continues its upward trend. Traditionally, bulk system voltage regulation has predominately been supplied by synchronous generators, and this {{is reflected in the}} language of industry requirements. Where <b>variable</b> <b>generation</b> is concerned the requirements are vague and unclear. The technology used in <b>variable</b> <b>generation</b> plants are capable of providing voltage support, but will require a shift from how these plants are traditionally operated. This paper discusses the capability of wind and solar plants to provide voltage regulation. It also examines the deficiencies in existing standards and provides recommendations to improve upon existing requirements in order to clearly define the role of <b>variable</b> <b>generation</b> in providing voltage support to the bulk electric grid.

40|$|Grid {{investments}} are considered as sunk costs {{with a very}} long lifetime, particularly in an offshore grid context. The market mechanisms for cost recovery of these {{investments are}} exposed to an increasing share of <b>variable</b> power <b>generation</b> at the supply side, demanding more flexibility in the system. Hence, it is {{of great interest to}} account for these changes in tools being used for decision support.

Moreover, an enhanced description of <b>variable</b> power <b>generation</b> is used to construct production profiles with a higher level of detail. The latter is achieved by simulating weather data for wind and solar incorporating higher temporal and spatial resolution than in previous studies. The impact of using new times series for <b>variable</b> power <b>generation,</b> and the introduction of system flexibility, are both presented separately using the North Sea area for a comparative case study with 2030 scenarios provided by ENTSO-E.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the supply {{function}} competition between power-generation firms with {{different levels of}} flexibility. Inflexible firms produce power at a constant rate over an operating horizon, while flexible firms can adjust their output to meet the fluctuations in electricity demand. Both types of firms compete in an electricity market by submitting supply functions to a system operator, who solves an optimal dispatch problem to determine the production level for each firm and the corresponding market price. We study how firms’ (in) flexibility affects their equilibrium behavior and the market price. We also analyze the impact of <b>variable</b> <b>generation</b> (such as wind and solar power) on the equilibrium, with {{the focus on the}} effects of the amount of <b>variable</b> <b>generation,</b> its priority in dispatch, and the production- based subsidies. We find that the classic supply function equilibrium model overestimates the intensity of the market competition, and even more so as more <b>variable</b> <b>generation</b> is introduced into the system. The policy of economically curtailing <b>variable</b> <b>generation</b> intensifies the market competition, reduces price volatility, and improves the system’s overall efficiency. Moreover, we show that these benefits are most significant {{in the absence of the}} production-based subsidies...|$|E
