Later work in 1967 at Berkeley and 1971 at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory fully confirmed the discovery of element 102 and clarified earlier observations. In December 1966, the Berkeley group repeated the Dubna experiments and fully confirmed them, and used this data to finally assign correctly the isotopes they had previously synthesized but could not yet identify at the time, and thus claimed to have discovered nobelium in 1958 to 1961.|$|E

His then ground-breaking use of sound effects also contributed to the pressure. All this exacerbated his mental instability that included bipolar disorder, especially during the third series.

25|$|Rocker became {{convinced}} {{that the source of}} political institutions is an irrational belief in a higher authority, as Bakunin claimed in God and the State. However, Rocker rejected the Russian's rejection of theoretical propaganda and his claim that only revolutions can bring about change. Nevertheless, he was very much attracted by Bakunin's style, marked by pathos, emotion, and enthusiasm, designed to give the reader an impression of the heat of revolutionary moments. Rocker even attempted to emulate this style in his speeches, but was not <b>very</b> <b>convincing.</b> Kropotkin's anarcho-communist writings, on the other hand, were structured logically and contained an elaborate description of the future anarchist society. The work's basic premise, that an individual is entitled to receive the basic means of living from the community independently of his or her personal contributions, impressed Rocker.|$|E

The double victory is considered by many as the first acting grand slam since there were only two award giving bodies for movies at that time. Before the year ended, Aunor made Minsa'y isang Gamu-gamo (1976). This is the story of Corazon de la Cruz, a nurse who wanted to go to America to give a better future for her family, but her brother was shot by an American soldier on the eve of her flight to America. Knowing that the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos would not allow the public showing of any films criticizing the American existence in the Philippines, the producers tapped Aunor to star in the film believing that the superstar has connection with the president and his wife former First Lady Imelda Marcos. This film was the official entry of Premiere Productions to the 1976 Metro Manila Film Festival.|$|E
25|$|India made up {{for their}} early losses with a <b>very</b> <b>convincing</b> win over Kenya at Bristol by 94 runs four days later. India scored a massive 329/2 through centuries from Tendulkar (140 not out from 101 balls, 16 fours, 3 sixes), who had rejoined the team, and Dravid (104 not out from 109 balls, 10 fours). The pair scored 237 in 29 overs at a run rate of 8.17 before medium pacer Debashish Mohanty wiped up the Kenyan batsmen with a 4-wicket haul (4/56). Tendulkar, {{declared}} Man of the Match, later dedicated his ton to his late father. India followed this victory with a record win against Sri Lanka at Taunton by 157 runs. Ganguly (183 from 158 balls, 17 fours, 7 sixes) and Dravid (145 from 129 balls, 17 fours, 1 six) picked up two centuries at over a run a ball to get India to a mammoth total of 373/6, sharing a partnership of 318 runs in 44.9 overs. Sri Lanka were then rattled due to Robin Singh's 5/31, crashing to 216 all out. India {{then went on to}} seal a place in the Super Six stage with a win against hosts England at Edgbaston in Birmingham by 63 runs; in a match extended by a day due to rain, once again Ganguly (40 from 59 balls, 6 fours) and Dravid (53 from 82 balls, 6 fours) starred with the bat to score 238/2, while a strong team effort with the ball, led by Ganguly's 3/27, got England all out for just 169.|$|E

40|$|Leading {{spiral arms}} are a rare phenomenon. We present here {{one of the}} <b>very</b> few <b>convincing</b> {{candidates}} of spiral arms opening counter-intuitively {{in the same direction}} as the galaxy disk is rotating. This detection in a luminous IR galaxy (LIRG) IRAS 18293 - 3134 is based on near infrared (NIR) adaptive optics imaging with the Very Large Telescope and long-slit NIR spectroscopy with the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We discuss the orientation of the galaxy based on imaging and derive rotation curves from both emission and absorption features in the spectrum. The galaxy is strongly star-forming and has a minor companion in a high-velocity encounter. The fact that the arms of IRAS 18293 - 3134 are not easily traceable from optical images suggests that larger samples of high-quality NIR imaging of interacting systems and LIRGs might uncover further cases of leading arms, placing constraints on spiral arm theories and retrograde encounters, and especially on the relationship between disk masses and dark matter halo masses.

Of her paintings, opinions vary. Burke described her as [...] "arguably the best painter" [...] of the Sydney circle. Historian Geoffrey Dutton was unconvinced about her choice of subject but praised Bellette's [...] "assured if muted" [...] style, while dismissing the lesser efforts of her husband. Art historian and writer Sasha Grishin had a different view.

John Passmore and Bellette studied together both in Australia and England, travelled in Europe, and exhibited side by side in group shows.

40|$|International audienceRuntime {{enforcement}} (RE) is {{a technique}} where a so-called monitor modifies the execution of a system {{to comply with a}} desired property. RE consists in using a so called monitor to modify an input sequence of events so that it complies with the property. <b>Very</b> few <b>convincing</b> applications of runtime enforcement have been proposed so far since most of the proposed approaches remain on the theoretical level. In network security, RE monitors can detect and prevent Denial-of-Service attacks. In resource allocation, RE monitors can ensure fairness. Specifications in these domains express data-constraints over the received events where the timing between events matters. To formalize these requirements, we introduce Parameterized Timed Automata with Variables (PTAVs), an extension of Timed Automata (TAs) with internal and external variables. We then extend enforcement for TAs to enforcement for PTAVs. We model requirements from the considered application domains and show how enforcement monitors can ensure system correctness w. r. t. these requirements. Finally, we propose a prototype implementation to experiment RE monitors on some properties. Our experiments and the performance of RE monitors demonstrate the feasibility of our approach...|$|R
40|$|Hopkins' host-selection {{principle}} (HHSP) {{refers to}} the observation that many adult insects demonstrate a preference for the host species on which they themselves developed as larvae. The meaning of HHSP has changed significantly since its first proposal in 1916. This review considers how the meaning of HHSP has changed over time and considers the various mechanisms that could contribute to a behavioral bias for the developmental host. The assumption that HHSP implies that the behavior of adult insects is conditioned by larval experience has resulted in widespread condemnation of HHSP. Despite {{a great deal of}} attention, there is still <b>very</b> little <b>convincing</b> evidence for preimaginal conditioning of host choice in insects. But growing evidence indicates that genetic variation in behavior and conditioning during the life span of an adult insect can contribute to a preference for the host on which an insect developed. Insects can acquire adult oviposition or feeding preferences through exposure to chemical residues from the environment of earlier life history stages. The concepts of host races and host fidelity have become familiar and acceptable, while the association of HHSP with preimaginal conditioning has led to a general rejection of the term. 13 page(s...|$|R
