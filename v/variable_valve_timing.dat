25|$|Pre-cooling {{air before}} {{it enters the}} cylinders, {{injection}} of any substance other than air and fuel into the cylinders, variable-geometry intake and exhaust systems, and <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> were forbidden. Each cylinder could have only one fuel injector and a single plug spark ignition. Separate starting devices were used to start engines in the pits and on the grid. The crankcase and cylinder block {{had to be made}} of cast or wrought aluminium alloys. The crankshaft and camshafts had to be made from an iron alloy, pistons from an aluminium alloy and valves from alloys based on iron, nickel, cobalt or titanium. These restrictions were in place to reduce development costs on the engines.|$|E

25|$|As Honda {{entered into}} {{automobile}} manufacturing {{in the late}} 1960s, where Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Nissan had been making cars since before WWII, it appears that Honda instilled a sense of doing things a little differently than its Japanese competitors. Its mainstay products, like the Accord and Civic (with the exception of its USA-market 1993–97 Passport {{which was part of}} a vehicle exchange program with Isuzu (part of the Subaru-Isuzu joint venture)), have always employed front-wheel-drive powertrain implementation, which is currently a long held Honda tradition. Honda also installed new technologies into their products, first as optional equipment, then later standard, like anti lock brakes, speed sensitive power steering, and multi-port fuel injection in the early 1980s. This desire {{to be the first to}} try new approaches is evident with the creation of the first Japanese luxury chain Acura, and was also evident with the all aluminum, mid-engined sports car, the Honda NSX, which also introduced <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> technology, Honda calls VTEC.|$|E
500|$|The i has a [...] "rear-midship" [...] {{engine mounted}} {{just ahead of}} the rear axle, a highly unusual {{configuration}} in a small car where front-engine design has dominated since the 1970s. The 3B20 three-cylinder powerplant has an aluminium cylinder block, a displacement of 659cubic centimetres, and incorporates double overhead camshafts with MIVEC <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> in the cylinder head. Initially only an intercooled and turbocharged engine was offered, until a naturally aspirated version was introduced for 2007. A four-speed automatic gearbox transmits power to the rear or all four wheels, depending on specification.|$|E
500|$|Designed {{through early}} 1996, in September 1997 a revised LS 400 was {{introduced}} for the 1998 model year. Changes were a five-speed automatic transmission, increased engine output to , with <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> (VVT-i), and an added [...] of torque. Acceleration times and fuel economy were improved as a result. The suspension and steering also received minor tweaks to improve feel and handling. Stylistically, the vehicle sported a new front fascia, side mirrors, and updated wheels; a rear window diversity antenna replaced the conventional power mast. The cabin received upgrades, including a trip computer, HomeLink, retractable rear headrests, reading lamps, and ultraviolet-tinted glass, while the climate control gained a micron filtration feature with a smog sensor.|$|E
40|$|Controlled {{autoignition}} (CAI) combustion, {{also known}} as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), was achieved through the negative valve overlap approach by using small-lift camshafts. Three-dimensional multicycle engine simulations were carried out in order better to understand the effects of <b>variable</b> intake <b>valve</b> <b>timings</b> on the gas exchange process, mixing quality, CAI combustion, and pollutant formation in a four-stroke port fuel injection (PFI) gasoline engine. Full engine cycle simulation, including complete gas exchange and combustion processes, was carried out over several cycles {{in order to obtain}} the stable cycle for analysis. The combustion models {{used in the present study}} are a modified shell ignition model and a laminar and turbulent characteristic time model, which can take high residual gas fraction into account. After the validation of the model against experimental data, investigations of the effects of <b>variable</b> intake <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> strategies on the CAI combustion process were carried out. These analyses show that the intake valve opening (WO) and intake <b>valve</b> closing (IVC) <b>timings</b> have a strong influence on the gas exchange and mixing processes in the cylinder, which in turn affect the engine performance and emissions. Symmetric IVO timing relative to exhaust <b>valve</b> closing (EVC) <b>timing</b> tends to produce a more stratified mixture, earlier ignition timing, and localized combustion, and hence higher NO, and lower unburned HC and CO emissions, whereas retarded WO leads to faster mixing, a more homogeneous mixture, and uniform temperature distribution...|$|R

40|$|An Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition {{engine is}} a hybrid between a Diesel and an Otto Engine. It has good fuel efficiency, {{close to a}} Diesel engine and also very low {{emissions}} of NOX and nearly no particulate soot. Other emissions are higher but can be after treated by a catalyst. The engine {{has not yet been}} fully developed so far and lacks among others a good automatic control of the combustion angle which should be held in a small window to achieve the best performance. The objective in this thesis is to achieve fast control that can hold the combustion angle window for changes in inlet pressure, loads and engine speeds. The challenges are that the system has a delay which limits the bandwidth, the dynamics change with different working conditions and a relatively large noise amplitude. Using combustion angle as reference, <b>valve</b> <b>timings</b> as control signal and other variables as engine speed, inlet pressure and load changes as disturbances, a closed loop control system can be defined. Two control methods using different kinds of <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timings</b> and three controllers for each method were designed to cover most of the working conditions. These were connected by a hybrid automaton which handles all transitions and choice of controller. The result was a fast control with a 6 - 8 engine cycles risetime for reference changes and it can suppress inlet pressure and load disturbances well inside the combustion window. The noise showed to be white, that is using all frequencies. To achieve both a fast control and not magnify the noise a non-linear compensation link was designed that uses less gain and bandwidth for small errors. A problem with this kind of dynamic solution is engine speed ramps which needs fast reaction times which was impossible due to the delay. A proposed solution is to use mappings from non-delayed variables to do necessary adjustments of the control signal fast enough...|$|R

These were later upgraded to 180 and 195kilowatts (241 and 261hp) respectively in the VE model. When compared to the previous Ecotec engines, the Alloytec benefits from increased power output, responsiveness and fuel efficiency. The new engines were mated to a new five-speed 5L40E automatic transmission on the luxury V6 variants, and a new six-speed Aisin AY6 manual transmission on the six-cylinder SV6 sports variant. However, the long serving four-speed automatic carried on in other variants, albeit with further tweaks in an attempt to address complaints about refinement.

40|$|Abstract: Owing {{to their}} low carbon dioxide {{emissions}} and fuel consumptions, diesel engines have gained a significant market share of passenger cars in Europe. However, gasoline engines are exclusively used to power passenger cars in the People’s Republic of China and many other countries. The introduction of diesel engines to the passenger car market in many countries is unlikely {{to take place in}} the near future because of the limited diesel fuel supply, higher cost of diesel cars, and public perception of diesel vehicles. Therefore, development of high-efficiency gasoline engines is of particular importance. As part of a State Key Project of the National Basic Research Program (the 973 Program), the present authors have carried out systematic research and development of a high-efficiency gasoline engine. The engine was equipped in production with devices for mechanically <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> lift and <b>timing</b> and was operated with controlled autoignition (CAI) (homogeneous charge compression ignition) combustion under part-load conditions and spark-assisted combustion between the transitional region of CAI and the normal spark ignition (SI) combustion. This paper will describe the use of devices for <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> lift and <b>timing</b> in a single-cylinder engine and their control. The engine performance and emission results in the CAI operational region are presented. The ability of the engine to achieve rapid and smooth transition between CAI and SI will be illustrated. A brief discussion of the implication of the results on the calculated driving-cycle fuel consumption will be given at the end. Finally, the plan for future development of a multi-cylinder engine of <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> actuation will be given...|$|R

40|$|Variable valve-timing {{and lift}} are {{significant}} operating and design parameters affecting {{the performance and}} emissions in spark-ignition (SI) engines. Previous investigations have demonstrated that improvements in engine performance can be accomplished if the <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> is <b>variable.</b> Traditionally, <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> {{has been designed to}} optimize operation at high engine-speed and wide-open throttle conditions. Controlling <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> can improve the torque and power curve of a given engine. Variable valve-timing can be used to reduce fuel consumption and increase engine performance. Intake valve-opening timing was changed from 10 Â° crankshaft angle (CA) to 30 Â° CA for both advance and retard with 10 Â° CA intervals to the original opening timing. In this study, artificial neural-networks (ANNs) are used {{to determine the effects of}} intake <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> on the engine performance and fuel economy. Experimental studies were completed to obtain training and test data. Intake valve-timing and engine speed have been used as the input layer; engine torque and fuel consumption have been used as the output layer. For the torque testing data, root mean squared-error (RMSE), fraction of variance (R 2) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were found to be 0. 9017 %, 0. 9920 % and 7. 2613 %, respectively. Similarly, for the fuel consumption, RMSE, R 2 and MAPE were 0. 2860 %, 0. 9299 % and 7. 5448 %, respectively. With these results, we believe that the ANN can be used for the prediction of engine performance as an appropriate method for spark-ignition (SI) engines.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} the charge exchange process in a spark ignition engine has been presented.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. Most recent implementations of the Atkinson cycle are not ideal {{from the point of}} view of thermal conversion efficiency (TCE). For example, Toyota has put a gasoline engine in its Prius II which should achieve high efficiency by using a modified Atkinson cycle based on <b>variable</b> intake <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> management. Firstly, this implementation of the Atkinson cycle is not the ideal solution because some of the air is first sucked from the intake manifold into the cylinder and subsequently returned back there. Consequently, the oscillating air stream reduces the thermal conversion efficiency of this cycle to a considerable extent Secondly, this implementation of the Atkinson cycle only reaches low levels of indicated mean pressure (IMEP) and, thirdly, it is not suitable for part load engine operating points (BOP) because of the lower TCE. For these reasons, this implementation of the Atkinson cycle is only suitable for hybrid vehicles, where the engine - because it is not directly linked mechanically to the wheels - works only in its best EOP. This paper analyzes the losses in TCE of internal combustion engine (ICE) - especially for the Atkinson cycles - in detail, and a proposal is made for their reduction for aspirated and especially for high pressure supercharged engines. ksb 201...|$|R
