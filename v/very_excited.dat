5|$|In {{an early}} draft {{of what would}} later become Shakugan no Shana, Yashichiro Takahashi set the story in a {{different}} dimension and described the main character as having the initial personality of Shana, but the appearance of an older woman similar to Margery Daw. However, after talking with an editor, Takahashi rewrote the character to have the appearance of a young girl. In doing so, he used Shana's small build to symbolize a story of growth and to emphasize the physical conflict between her and her opponents. Noizi Ito was contacted in early August 2002 to be the illustrator for the series, and she was <b>very</b> <b>excited</b> to work on the project after she read the manuscript for the first novel; {{this was the first time}} Ito drew illustrations for a book.|$|E

Khan revealed that he {{had always wanted to}} look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, but he said he gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was <b>very</b> <b>excited,</b> but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if {{she would be able to}} do justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a conscious effort to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E

5|$|In September, Alexander {{believed}} {{that he would make}} his final selection with a December verbal commitment and an April signing of his National Letter of Intent. On October 7, the Hoophall Classic schedule was announced and Curie was scheduled to play Montverde Academy on January 20. By some accounts Kansas was a favorite because his girlfriend was a student at Kansas and the 2013–14 Kansas Jayhawks were scheduled to play the 2013–14 Duke Blue Devils at Chicago's United Center in the ESPN Champions Classic on November 12 just before his scheduled announcement. In 2013 Caelynn Manning-Allen became a freshman on the Kansas women's basketball team. However, Illinois was <b>very</b> <b>excited</b> to be in serious contention for Alexander. It was the first time since Derrick Rose in 2006 that a top 5 prospect was still considering Illinois so late into his senior year and Alexander's level of interest seemed much higher than Rose's. Following his Illinois visit, his scheduled announcement date had moved forward to November 15. On October 31, Alexander officially eliminated Michigan State from his candidate list, leaving Kansas, Illinois, DePaul and Memphis in contention.|$|E

But once Peter shows the deposit check, he immediately apologizes and exclaims how they are <b>very</b> <b>excited</b> to host Stewie's birthday party. Peter, angered by how he was treated, states that they won't be celebrating Stewie's party there, which causes a crowd of people to circle around Manager shouting for the reservation. Peter, realizing what he has just done, immediately returns home with a poorly crafted lie in an attempt to evade Lois' aggravation which involves him saying that they are Nazis who torture, kill and kidnap people. He pretends that he's already planned an extravagant party at home so that Lois doesn't have do any work.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} display is the behavior of breaking branches, which {{all members of the}} group carry out. Even infants break small branches (or twigs), letting them fall to the soil, but the most spectacular is the alpha male who chooses large, dry branches which he hits with his hands and feet in spectacular jumps, so that they fall. Usually such branches make a tremendous sound as they fall through the other branches, {{and the members of the}} group become <b>very</b> <b>excited</b> and chatter loudly. This behavior is quite commonly discharged towards an observer when the animals have lost their fear.|$|E

25|$|Metzger {{worked to}} {{encourage}} friendly {{relationships with other}} religious communities. One idea that Metzger proposed was {{the establishment of a}} religious United Nations in Jerusalem. He first advocated this in late 2004 after mediating a highly publicized dispute between Jerusalem Haredim and the Armenian Christian community. Under Metzger's plan, the new body would contain representatives of the world's religions, as opposed to nations. Metzger has also suggested that the Dalai Lama could lead the assembly. The Dalai Lama was reportedly <b>very</b> <b>excited</b> at the idea, and pledged to help Metzger realize his plan. Other supporters include Frederico Major, the co-president of the Alliance for Civilizations, a Spanish lobby group for international conflict resolution.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was <b>very</b> <b>excited</b> & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E
25|$|Jung did {{not plan}} to study {{psychiatry}} since it was not considered prestigious at the time. But, studying a psychiatric textbook, he became <b>very</b> <b>excited</b> when he discovered that psychoses are personality diseases. His interest was immediately captured—it combined the biological and the spiritual, {{exactly what he was}} searching for. In 1895 Jung began to study medicine at the University of Basel. Barely a year later in 1896, his father Paul died and left the family near destitute. They were helped out by relatives who also contributed to Jung's studies. During his student days, he entertained his contemporaries with the family legend, that his paternal grandfather was the illegitimate son of Wolfgang Goethe and his German great-grandmother, Sophie Ziegler. In later life, he pulled back from this tale, saying only that Sophie was a friend of Goethe's niece.|$|E
