500|$|The V-22 is {{equipped}} with a glass cockpit, which incorporates four Multi-function displays (MFDs, compatible with night-vision goggles) and one shared Central Display Unit (CDU), to display various images including: digimaps, imagery from the Turreted Forward Looking Infrared System primary flight instruments, navigation (TACAN, <b>VOR,</b> <b>ILS,</b> GPS, INS), and system status. The flight director panel of the Cockpit Management System (CMS) allows for fully coupled (autopilot) functions that take the aircraft from forward flight into a [...] hover with no pilot interaction other than programming the system. The glass cockpit of the canceled CH-46X was derived from the V-22. The fuselage is not pressurized, and personnel must wear on-board oxygen masks above 10,000 feet.|$|E
50|$|The airport has 7 hangars, Aeronautical Mechanicals, <b>VOR,</b> <b>ILS</b> CAT I, and PAPI (Precision Approach Path Indicator) system.|$|E
50|$|Air freight, charter, limo, courier, and {{overnight}} express, {{as well as}} full service for jet aircraft refueling are among the services offered by the airport. <b>VOR,</b> <b>ILS,</b> and RNAV navigational approaches are featured for the runways. The airport is an uncontrolled airport that has no control tower.|$|E
50|$|The FAA also {{contends that}} only a single set of navigational {{equipment}} will be needed on an aircraft for both LAAS and WAAS capability. This lowers initial cost and maintenance per aircraft since only one receiver is required instead of multiple receivers for NDB's, DME, <b>VOR,</b> <b>ILS,</b> MLS and GPS. The FAA hopes this will result in decreased cost to the airlines and passengers as well as general aviation.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2010, the Doppler Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (DVOR) {{controlling}} the Ninoy Aquino International Airport's navigational aid failed following a short circuit. The Manila International Airport Authority got the replacement parts from Subic Bay Airport's own VOR thus disabling the Subic VOR from June to September 2010. But as of mid-October 2010 the SBIA has partially operated its navigational aids like the <b>VOR,</b> <b>ILS</b> and Airport Radar and resumed its ATIS during daylight hours only and later become fully functional {{in the first}} week of November 2010.|$|E

50|$|Determining {{that their}} only hope of {{returning}} {{to the present day}} is to repeat the previous maneuver, and with dwindling fuel supply, the plane increases altitude in an attempt to catch the same freak jet stream and to return to 1961. At first, the maneuver appears to work; New York City is once again visible, and although they still cannot contact Idlewild, they are able to reach LaGuardia Airport, which the crew initially plans to use to refuel. However, the air traffic controller on the radio does not understand references to current aircraft technology such as <b>VOR,</b> <b>ILS</b> and jet aircraft. The controller eventually allows the aircraft to land but orders the captain to report to the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) office afterward; one of the officers remarks that they haven't called the Federal Aviation Agency by that name in years.|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} Navaids Checkout System {{for use in}} Space Shuttle {{development is}} discussed. The groundwork leading to the development is presented, followed by {{a description of the}} hardware. Finally, system utilization including operator interface and system software is discussed. The Navaids Checkout System is extremely flexible with capability to handle different test articles with a minimum of hardware reconfiguration. Application software is written in a high level user-oriented test language. The checkout system has been in operation for approximately one year with capability to handle <b>VOR,</b> <b>ILS,</b> TACAN, ATC Radar Beacon, and UHF/VHF communications equipment...|$|E
40|$|A {{display device}} is {{disclosed}} which is particularly suited for providing {{the pilot of}} an aircraft with combined inflight attitude, heading, altitude, and horizontal situation information previously available only by using two or three devices providing separate displays. The preferred embodiment combines a commonly used and commercially available flight director-type device for providing a display in combination with a miniature aircraft supported for angular displacement from a vertical orientation to indicate heading error, or heading offset, and an extended course deviation indicator bar which projects into juxtaposition with the miniature aircraft for providing a true picture of the aircraft's horizontal situation relative to a selective <b>VOR,</b> <b>ILS,</b> or MLS course...|$|E
