30|$|Conclusion: <b>The</b> {{respiratory}} <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IVC diameter {{were not}} explained by a higher IVC compliance {{but rather by}} higher respiratory <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CVP in responders than in non-responders.

40|$|Aim: <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} was twofold: i) in a case-control design, to {{determine}} the relationship between anatomical <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> Willis and cerebrovascular accidents; ii) to assess the association between anatomical <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> Willis and aneurisms among patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Methods: A case-control {{study was conducted in}} Albania in 2013 - 2014, including 100 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and 100 controls (individuals without cerebrovascular accidents). Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage underwent a CT angiography procedure, whereas individuals in the control group underwent a magnetic resonance angiography procedure. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the association between cerebrovascular accidents and <b>the</b> anatomical <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> Willis. Conversely, Fisher’s exact test was used to compare <b>the</b> prevalence <b>of</b> aneurisms between subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with and without anatomical <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> Willis. Results: Among patients, there were 22 (22 %) cases with anatomical <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> Willis compared with 10 (10 %) individuals in the control group (P= 0. 033). There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anatomical <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> Willis between patients and controls (P= 0. 402). In age- and-sex adjusted logistic regression models, there was evidence of a significant positive association between cerebrovascular accidents and <b>the</b> anatomical <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> Willis (OR= 1. 87, 95 %CI= 1. 03 - 4. 68, P= 0. 048). Within <b>the</b> patients’ group, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 52 cases with aneurisms, there were 22 (42. 3 %) individuals with anatomical <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> Willis compared with no individuals with anatomical variations among the 48 patients without aneurisms (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: This study provides useful evidence on the association between anatomical <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> Willis and cerebrovascular accidents in transitional Albania. Furthermore, findings from this study confirm <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anatomical <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> Willis in <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> cerebral aneurisms...|$|R
30|$|Introduction: <b>The</b> {{respiratory}} <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter allow reliably predicting fluid responsiveness in {{critically ill}} patients under mechanical ventilation. Two mechanisms could be involved {{to explain this}} phenomenon—a higher compliance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IVC and or a higher respiratory <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IVC backward pressure, in other words, the central venous pressure (CVP), when hypovolemia. We aimed at determining <b>the</b> respective weight <b>of</b> these phenomenon and <b>the</b> physiological determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respiratory <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IVC diameter.|$|R

30|$|Mass {{displacements}} {{within the}} Earth system cause <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth’s gravity field and its rotation.

By separating the observed integral gravity signal into contributions from different Earth subsystems, also individual mechanisms of polar motion excitation can be studied. Most important are <b>the</b> <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> degree- 2 spherical harmonic potential coefficients C_ 21 and S_ 21 as these are directly related to polar motion excitation (Barnes et al. 1983).|$|R
5|$|A {{commonly}} studied <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem involves {{networks of}} interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where {{three or more}} of the curves meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, and there may be {{more than one way to}} continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E
