50|$|Apart from {{publications}} such as IT and Oz, both {{of which}} had a national circulation, the 1960s and 1970s saw {{the emergence of a}} whole range of local alternative newspapers, which were usually published monthly. These were largely made possible by the introduction in the 1950s of offset litho printing, which was much cheaper than traditional typesetting and use of the rotary letterpress. Such local papers included Aberdeen Peoples Press, Alarm (Swansea), Andersonstown News (Belfast), Brighton Voice, Bristol <b>Voice,</b> <b>Feedback</b> (Norwich), Hackney People's Press, Islington Gutter Press, Leeds Other Paper, Response (Earl's Court, London), Sheffield Free Press, and the West Highland Free Press. A 1980 review identified some 70 such publications around the United Kingdom but estimated that the true number could well have run into hundreds. Such papers were usually published anonymously, for fear of the UK's draconian libel laws. They followed a broad anarchist, libertarian, left-wing of the Labour Party, socialist approach but the philosophy of a paper was usually flexible as those responsible for its production came and went. Most papers were run on collective principles.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to support the {{development}} of a full duplex, spread spectrum voice communications system. The assembly and testing of a prototype system consisting of a Harris PRISM spread spectrum radio, a TMS 320 C 54 x signal processing development board and a Zilog Z 80180 microprocessor was underway at the start of this project. The efforts under this project were the development of multiple access schemes, analysis of full duplex <b>voice</b> <b>feedback</b> delays, and the development and analysis of forward error correction (FEC) algorithms. The multiple access analysis involved the selection between code division multiple access (CDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA). Full duplex <b>voice</b> <b>feedback</b> analysis involved the analysis of packet size and delays associated with full loop <b>voice</b> <b>feedback</b> for confirmation of radio system performance. FEC analysis included studies of the performance under the expected burst error scenario with the relatively short packet lengths, and analysis of implementation in the TMS 320 C 54 x digital signal processor. When the capabilities and the limitations of the components used were considered, the multiple access scheme chosen was a combination TDMA/FDMA scheme that will provide up to eight users on each of three separate frequencies. Packets to and from each user will consist of 16 samples at a rate of 8, 000 samples per second for a total of 2 ms of voice information. The resulting <b>voice</b> <b>feedback</b> delay will therefore be 4 - 6 ms. The most practical FEC algorithm for implementation was a convolutional code with a Viterbi decoder.

40|$|Accurate vocal {{production}} {{relies on}} several factors including sensory feedback {{and the ability}} to predict future challenges to the control processes. Repetitive patterns of perturbations in sensory feedback by themselves elicit implicit expectations in the vocal control system regarding the timing, quality and direction of perturbations. In the present study, the predictability of <b>voice</b> pitch-shifted auditory <b>feedback</b> was experimentally manipulated. A block of trials where all pitch-shift stimuli were upward, and therefore predictable was contrasted against an unpredictable block of trials in which the stimulus direction was randomized between upward and downward pitch-shifts. It was found that predictable perturbations in <b>voice</b> auditory <b>feedback</b> led to a reduction in the proportion of compensatory vocal responses, which might be indicative of a reduction in vocal control. The predictable perturbations also led to a reduction in the magnitude of the N 1 component of cortical Event Related Potentials (ERP) that was associated with the reflexive compensations to the perturbations. We hypothesize that formation of expectancy in our study is accompanied by involuntary allocation of attentional resources occurring as a result of habituation or learning, that in turn trigger limited and controlled exploration-related motor variability in the vocal control system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{motor-driven}} {{predictions about}} expected sensory feedback (efference copies) {{have been proposed}} {{to play an important}} role in recognition of sensory consequences of self-produced motor actions. In the auditory system, this effect was suggested to result in suppression of sensory neural responses to self-produced voices that are predicted by the efference copies during vocal production in comparison with passive listening to the playback of the identical self-vocalizations. In the present study, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in response to upward pitch shift stimuli (PSS) with five different magnitudes (0, + 50, + 100, + 200 and + 400 cents) at voice onset during active vocal production and passive listening to the playback. Results Results indicated that the suppression of the N 1 component during vocal production was largest for unaltered <b>voice</b> <b>feedback</b> (PSS: 0 cents), became smaller as the magnitude of PSS increased to 200 cents, and was almost completely eliminated in response to 400 cents stimuli. Conclusions Findings of the present study suggest that the brain utilizes the motor predictions (efference copies) to determine the source of incoming stimuli and maximally suppresses the auditory responses to unaltered feedback of self-vocalizations. The reduction of suppression for 50, 100 and 200 cents and its elimination for 400 cents pitch-shifted voice auditory feedback support the idea that motor-driven suppression of <b>voice</b> <b>feedback</b> leads to distinctly different sensory neural processing of self vs. non-self vocalizations. This characteristic may enable the audio-vocal system to more effectively detect and correct for unexpected errors in the feedback of self-produced voice pitch compared with externally-generated sounds. </p...|$|E

When the congruence between utterance and feedback breaks down, the illusion is also broken. Compared to a baseline condition in which participants heard their own <b>voice</b> as <b>feedback,</b> hearing a stranger’s voice induced robust changes in the fundamental frequency (F 0) of their production. Moreover, the shift in F 0 appears to be feedback dependent, since shift patterns depended reliably on the relationship between the participant’s own F 0 and the stranger-voice F 0. The shift in F 0 was evident both when the illusion was present and after it was broken, suggesting that auditory feedback from production may be used separately for self-recognition and for vocal motor control.

40|$|The pitch-shift {{paradigm}} {{has become}} a widely used method for studying the role of <b>voice</b> pitch auditory <b>feedback</b> in <b>voice</b> control. This paradigm introduces small, brief pitch shifts in <b>voice</b> auditory <b>feedback</b> to vocalizing subjects. The perturbations trigger a reflexive mechanism that counteracts the change in pitch. The underlying mechanisms of the vocal responses are thought to reflect a negative feedback control system {{that is similar to}} constructs developed to explain other forms of motor control. Another use of this technique requires subjects to voluntarily change the pitch of their voice when they hear a pitch shift stimulus. Under these conditions, short latency responses are produced that change voice pitch to match that of the stimulus. The pitch-shift technique has been used with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, and has shown that at vocal onset there is normally a suppression of neural activity related to vocalization. However, if a pitch-shift is also presented at voice onset, there is a cancellation of this suppression, which has been interpreted to mean that one way in which a person distinguishes self-vocalization from vocalization of others is by a comparison of the intended voice and the actual voice. Studies of the pitch shift reflex in the fMRI environment show that the superior temporal gyrus (STG) {{plays an important role in}} the process of controlling voice F 0 based on auditory feedback. Additional studies using fMRI for effective connectivity modeling show that the left and right STG play critical roles in correcting for an error in voice production. While both the left and right STG are involved in this process, a feedback loop develops between left and right STG during perturbations, in which the left to right connection becomes stronger, and a new negative right to left connection emerges along with the emergence of other feedback loops within the cortical network tested...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The Resusci Anne (RA) Skills StationTM (Laerdal, Norway) {{has shown}} to be a {{feasible}} strategy for Basic Life Support (BLS) refresher training. We expanded and tested this station for initial acquisition of BLS skills. Methods: 120 Pharmacy students were randomized into instructor-led (IL) group training (max 6 students, 90 minutes) or individual computer-guided (CG) training (max 60 minutes). CG participants first followed the instructions of an edited Mini AnneTM video (Laerdal, Norway) during 20 minutes using a full size torso and a face shield, immediately followed by the use of the RA Skills StationTM software with <b>voice</b> <b>feedback.</b> After 7 weeks students were tested performing BLS for 3 minutes. Adequate compression depth was defined as 40 - 55 mm, compression rate as 80 - 120 /min, ventilation volume as 400 - 1000 ml. Results: After excluding 24 participants because of previous BLS training or illness, the IL and CG group had 47 (85 % female, mean age 21 yrs) and 49 (70 % female, mean age 21 yrs) participants respectively. Immediately after training, only one student in the CG group had not achieved adequate mean compression depth and one had not achieved adequate mean ventilation volume. After 7 weeks 32 / 47 (68 %) of the participants from the IL group had adequate mean compression depth vs. 34 / 49 (69 %) in the CG group. For mean compression rate this was 42 / 47 (89 %) vs. 47 / 49 (96 %), for mean ventilation volume 24 / 47 (51 %) vs. 29 / 49 (59 %). None of the differences were statistically significant. Conclusions: A video for self-directed learning followed by further refinement of skills with <b>voice</b> <b>feedback</b> resulted in adequate BLS skills in the majority of students without previous BLS training.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of <b>feedback</b> quality and <b>voice</b> in {{performance}} evaluation. A model is developed and tested in which <b>feedback</b> quality and <b>voice</b> enhance procedural fairness perceptions (procedure effects), and procedural fairness perceptions in turn lead to different positive reactions (fair process effects). Voice is distinguished in instrumental and non-instrumental voice. The findings based on questionnaire data from 60 early career accountants show that the two components of <b>voice</b> and <b>feedback</b> quality are uniquely associated with procedural fairness perceptions, and through procedural fairness with distributive justice, trust in superior, and satisfaction with the appraisal review. Beyond these fairness effects, feedback quality is directly associated with satisfaction with the appraisal review and distributive justice, while instrumental and non-instrumental voice are directly associated with interpersonal trust in supervisor. Thus, feedback quality is mainly associated with outcome-based effects, while voice primarily enhances relational effects. These findings show that <b>feedback</b> quality and <b>voice</b> serve important but different roles in performance evaluation and help promote positive attitudes and behaviour of employees beyond fair process effects. fairness;trust;evaluation;voice;fair process effect...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has found that while speaking, subjects react to perturbations in pitch of <b>voice</b> auditory <b>feedback</b> by changing their voice fundamental frequency (F 0) to compensate for the perceived pitch-shift. The long response latencies (150 – 200 ms) suggest they may be too slow to assist in on-line control of the local pitch contour patterns associated with lexical tones on a syllable-to-syllable basis. In the present study, we introduced pitch-shifted auditory feedback to native speakers of Mandarin Chinese while they produced disyllabic sequences /ma ma/ with different tonal combinations at a natural speaking rate. Voice F 0 response latencies (100 – 150 ms) to the pitch perturbations were shorter than syllable durations reported elsewhere. Response magnitudes increased from 50 cents during static tone to 85 cents during dynamic tone productions. Response latencies and peak times decreased in phrases involving a dynamic change in F 0. The larger response magnitudes and shorter latency and peak times in tasks requiring accurate, dynamic control of F 0, indicate this automatic system for regulation of voice F 0 may be task-dependent. These findings suggest that auditory feedback may be used to help regulate voice F 0 during production of bi-tonal Mandarin phrases...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{stimulus}} timing on vocal responses to pitch-shifted feedback {{was investigated in}} different intonation patterns during Mandarin speech production. While speaking a four-word sentence consisting of the high-level tone, where the fundamental frequency (F 0) of the final word was either increased (question intonation) or slightly falling (statement intonation), pitch-shift stimuli (± 100 cents, 200 ms duration) were presented at three different times (160, 240, or 340 ms) after vocal onset. Results showed that in the question intonation, response magnitudes (16 cents) were significantly reduced for the 340 ms condition compared to the 160 (26 cents) or 240 (23 cents) ms conditions. No significant differences were found, however, {{as a function of}} stimulus timing in the statement intonation. These findings demonstrate that a planned change in F 0 can cause a modulation in the reflexive response to a perturbation in <b>voice</b> pitch <b>feedback</b> {{and that there is a}} critical time period during which the response mechanisms are most sensitive to the planning process.
