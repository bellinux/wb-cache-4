5|$|Architecture in {{the style}} of a tongkonan is still <b>very</b> <b>common.</b> Various {{administration}} buildings were built in this style in recent years, e.g. the Kecamatan building in Rantepao.|$|E
5|$|Besides repúblicas, studio apartments are <b>very</b> <b>common</b> {{around the}} university. While more {{expensive}} than the shared houses, they afford more privacy and have more flexible contracts, are well as being furnished.|$|E
5|$|Car {{accidents}} are <b>very</b> <b>common</b> in the United States {{and the majority}} of these road crashes are caused by human error.|$|E
50|$|Glucagon acts <b>very</b> quickly; <b>common</b> {{side-effects}} include {{headache and}} nausea.|$|R

5|$|Chicken or lamb {{baked in}} the oven is <b>very</b> <b>common</b> with potatoes, and {{sometimes}} fried onions as well.|$|E
5|$|If {{someone has}} been {{diagnosed}} with HIT, some recommend routine Doppler sonography of the leg veins to identify deep vein thromboses, as this is <b>very</b> <b>common</b> in HIT.|$|E
5|$|An Ontario Parks visitor's permit is not {{required}} to drive through Algonquin Park. However, one is required for the use of any trails, campgrounds, the Visitor Centre, or similar facilities within the park boundary. Moose and deer are <b>very</b> <b>common</b> through Algonquin, especially at night and in the morning, and present a major driving hazard.|$|E
50|$|The all-black {{legs of the}} {{ruddy darter}} {{distinguish}} it from the otherwise <b>very</b> similar <b>common</b> darter (Sympetrum striolatum) and vagrant darter (Sympetrum vulgatum), both of which show yellow stripes on their legs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid, Colonel Ray," [...] I said, [...] "that {{you are not}} {{inclined}} to give me credit for <b>very</b> much <b>common</b> sense. Take those papers to Lord Chelsford. I will come round to your rooms as soon as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, {{nothing of}} that sort. An alloy that was <b>very</b> common--as <b>common</b> as brass, for example. It was called--let me see--" [...] He {{squeezed}} {{his forehead with}} the fingers of one hand. [...] "I am forgetting everything," [...] he said.|$|R
5|$|Coonhounds existed as a {{distinct}} type by the mid-to-late 1800s. By 1885 a raccoon pelt sold for approximately 25 cents, a fair price for the time. Up to World War I raccoons were <b>very</b> <b>common</b> despite being hunted often, and were sometimes poisoned {{to keep them from}} destroying crops.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{variability}} of the mallard's genetic code, which gives it its vast interbreeding capability, mutations in the genes that decide plumage colour are <b>very</b> <b>common</b> and {{have resulted in a}} wide variety of hybrids such as Brewer's duck (mallard × gadwall, Anas strepera).|$|E
5|$|Following an eruption, it is <b>very</b> <b>common</b> for {{the public}} to hold fears about {{chemical}} contamination of water supplies. However, in general, the physical impacts of an ashfall will tend to overwhelm problems caused by the release of chemical contaminants from fresh volcanic ash. Impacts vary according to the type of treatment system.|$|E
5000|$|... the English {{journals}} are {{indulging in}} one of their periodical battles over the corset question. At moderate intervals {{the pros and cons of}} tight lacing are hotly discussed by our British brothers and sisters with very great fervor and <b>very</b> little <b>common</b> sense.|$|R
50|$|Tobias Billström has {{promoted}} that countries in Europe {{and the world}} should help refugees from Iraq. He has emphasized {{the need for a}} <b>very</b> strong <b>common</b> asylum and migration policy, and that this could give more Iraqis in need of protection to access this.|$|R
50|$|Single-ended, {{floating}} common. An {{isolated and}} quasi-balanced input (the floating common is typically {{connected to the}} (-) input of a differential amplifier). Suitable for off-ground measurements up to the breakdown voltage of the isolation barrier, and exhibits <b>very</b> good <b>common</b> mode rejection (100 db typical).|$|R
5|$|Ginóbili is a 6ft 6 in (1.98 m), 205lb (93kg) left-handed {{shooting}} guard {{who has been}} deployed either as a sixth man or starter for the Spurs. He has {{established himself as a}} reliable and versatile back court presence, and was a relatively late bloomer, entering the NBA at age 25 in a period when entering the NBA as a teenager was <b>very</b> <b>common.</b>|$|E
5|$|Only {{three classes}} of pigment (ommochromes, bilins and guanine) have been {{identified}} in spiders, although other pigments have been detected but not yet characterized. Melanins, carotenoids and pterins, <b>very</b> <b>common</b> in other animals, are apparently absent. In some species, the exocuticle of the legs and prosoma is modified by a tanning process, resulting in brown coloration.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists Jose Bonaparte and Fernando Novas {{coined the}} name Abelisauridae in 1985 when they {{described}} the eponymous Abelisaurus. The name is formed {{from the family}} name of Roberto Abel, who discovered Abelisaurus, {{as well as from}} the Greek word σαυρος/sauros meaning 'lizard'. The <b>very</b> <b>common</b> suffix -idae is usually applied to zoological family names and is derived from the Greek suffix -ιδαι/-idai, which indicates a plural noun.|$|E
5000|$|When {{it comes}} to rugby, France and New Zealand have a <b>very</b> rich <b>common</b> history. France played their first ever test match in 1906 against the famous [...] "Originals" [...] New Zealand team, {{on their way home}} after an eventful tour of the British Isles.|$|R
50|$|Caramel candies are {{sometimes}} referred to as taffy (taffy apples), but are <b>very</b> different from <b>common</b> salt water taffy.|$|R
50|$|The English and Fijian {{lyrics are}} not {{translations}} of each other, {{and in fact}} have <b>very</b> little in <b>common.</b>|$|R
5|$|Plant use of {{endophytic}} {{fungi in}} defense is a <b>very</b> <b>common</b> phenomenon. Most plants have endophytes, microbial organisms that live within them. While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and pathogenic microbes. Endophytes {{can help the}} plant by producing toxins harmful to other organisms that would attack the plant, such as alkaloid producing fungi which are common in grasses such as tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea).|$|E
5|$|Pteranodon longiceps {{would have}} shared {{the sky with}} the giant-crested {{pterosaur}} Nyctosaurus. Compared to P. longiceps, which was a <b>very</b> <b>common</b> species, Nyctosaurus was rare, making up only 3% of pterosaur fossils from the formation. Also less common was the early toothed bird, Ichthyornis.|$|E
5|$|Stellar {{encounters}} are not <b>very</b> <b>common</b> in {{the disk}} of the Milky Way, where the Sun is, {{but in the}} dense core of globular clusters they occur frequently. At {{some point during the}} 10 billion years, the neutron star is thought to have encountered and captured the host star of the planet into a tight orbit, probably losing a previous companion star in the process.|$|E
25|$|A fluid (also called heat {{transfer}} fluid) {{passes through the}} receiver and becomes <b>very</b> hot. <b>Common</b> fluids are synthetic oil, molten salt and pressurized steam. The fluid containing the heat is transported to a heat engine where {{about a third of}} the heat is converted to electricity.|$|R
50|$|Though {{also known}} as mate, mate de coca has <b>very</b> little in <b>common</b> with the yerba mate drink in Southeastern South America.|$|R
50|$|A Sarvastivada Abhidharma, {{composed}} in Sanskrit, survives in Chinese and Tibetan traditions. Though the Theravādin Abhidhamma is well preserved and best known, {{it should be}} noted that a number of the early Eighteen Schools each had their own distinct Abhidharma collection with not <b>very</b> much <b>common</b> textual material, though sharing methodology.|$|R
5|$|The {{first phase}} saw the walls built with mudbrick, a <b>very</b> <b>common</b> feature of Euphrates-area structures. Although {{the shape of}} the {{building}} after its initial phase cannot be determined, Paillet presumes that its size likely corresponded to that of the current building. The small salient bastion that juts out of the northern wall dates to the first phase.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} {{has a very}} large range of 5.9millionkm2 (2.29millionsqmi). The total {{population}} is unknown, but the bird is described as <b>very</b> <b>common</b> in Jordan and common in Egypt. It has an expanding range and increasing population. Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that the pale crag martin is {{not considered to be}} threatened, and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{was named}} by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1905, {{along with the}} family Tyrannosauridae. The name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek words τυραννος/tyrannos ('tyrant') and σαυρος/sauros ('lizard'). The <b>very</b> <b>common</b> suffix -idae is {{normally}} appended to zoological family names and is derived from the Greek suffix -ιδαι/-idai, which indicates a plural noun.|$|E
5000|$|Benson's {{successor}} as {{a popular}} and <b>very</b> large <b>common</b> carp may not live {{too far away from}} the fish's former haunt.

5000|$|The {{character}} of Richie Blazik is cut {{and the character}} Jimmy Kaminsky is substituted, however the two characters have <b>very</b> little in <b>common.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{was a very}} {{successful}} car in hill-climbing and was eventually followed by the Bandini 1000 with which it has <b>very</b> much in <b>common.</b>|$|R
