60|$|It {{was almost}} nine the {{following}} morning before Professor Maxon and von Horn entered the laboratory. Scarcely had the older man passed the doorway than he drew up his hands in horrified consternation. <b>Vat</b> <b>Number</b> Thirteen lay dashed to the floor--the glass cover was broken to a million pieces--a sticky, brownish substance covered the matting. Professor Maxon hid {{his face in his}} hands.|$|E
6000|$|As von Horn and Professor Maxon talked {{together}} in the laboratory before the upsetting of <b>vat</b> <b>Number</b> Thirteen, a grotesque and horrible creature had slunk from the low shed at {{the opposite side of}} the campong until it had crouched at the flimsy door of the building in which the two men conversed. For a while it listened intently, but when von Horn urged the necessity for dispatching certain [...] "terrible, soulless creatures" [...] an expression of intermingled fear and hatred convulsed the hideous features, and like a great grizzly it turned and lumbered awkwardly across the campong toward the easterly, or back wall of the enclosure.|$|E
50|$|The VAT Information Exchange System (VIES) is an {{electronic}} means of transmitting {{information relating to}} VAT registration (i.e., validity of <b>VAT</b> <b>numbers)</b> of companies registered in the European Union. EU law requires that, where goods or services are procured within the EU, VAT must be paid only in the member state where the purchaser resides. For this reason, suppliers need {{an easy way to}} validate the <b>VAT</b> <b>numbers</b> presented by purchasers. This validation is performed through VIES.|$|R

5000|$|VIES {{does not}} itself {{maintain}} a <b>VAT</b> <b>number</b> database.

This information includes at least a [...] "YES/NO" [...] answer on the existence and validity of the supplied number. It may also include additional information, such as the holder's name and address, if this is provided by the member state.|$|E
