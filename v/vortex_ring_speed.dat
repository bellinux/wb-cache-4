40|$|A <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> is a torus-shaped vortex {{consisting}} of a region of fluid spinning around an imaginary axis line that forms a closed loop. It is an important phenomenon in animal kingdom and engineering applications. Birds and flying insects use buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> to glide higher altitudes; squid and jellyfish produce <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> during propulsion; <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> also participate in the blood flow through the human hearts. With {{the help of the}} <b>vortex</b> <b>ring,</b> animals can move fast and produce large thrust. In engineering, the Underwater Compressed Air Energy Storage (UWCAES) system uses surplus electricity to compress air into flexible accumulators (balloons) to store energy underwater. Balloons of stored compressed air may rupture when over-pressurized or pierced by a sharp object. This may generate a large-scale buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring,</b> leading to water surface disruptions and undesirable waves. As a result, it is a necessity to study the hydrodynamics of a buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring.</b> This work presents three papers to {{have a better understanding of}} the fluid dynamics of a buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring.</b> The first two papers focus on the flow behavior of a buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> and the third paper studies the vortex rings’ influence on the ambient fluid (flow behind a buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring).</b> The first paper characterized the formation conditions of a buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> and its transition behavior from a laminar to a turbulent <b>vortex</b> <b>ring.</b> It is followed by a paper investigating the flow characteristics of a buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> experimentally, including rising velocity, ring radius, relative core size, circulation and the energy development of a buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring.</b> The final paper analyzed the wake of a <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> by simplifying that the core of a <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> is solid.

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulation (DNS) {{is used to}} study {{some aspects of the}} dynamics of <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> in viscous, incompressible ow at Reynolds numbers (defined as the ratio of the initial circulation to the kinematic viscosity) in the range of 103 to 104. Firstly, the effect of the particular initial core azimuthal vorticity profile of a <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> on its subsequent evolution in unbounded ow is studied. <b>Vortex</b> <b>rings</b> {{with a wide range of}} initial core vorticity profiles are shown to relax to a common equilibrium state. Additionally the behaviour of the equilibrium <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> at large times is studied. When the slenderness ratio of the <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> increases beyond a particular limit, the <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> diverge from the common equilibrium state and follow paths determined by the viscosity of the uid. Secondly, the interaction of a laminar <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> with a non-deformable, free-slip surface at an oblique angle of incidence leading to the phenomenon of vortex reconnection is investigated. Specifically the effect of Reynolds number on the dynamics of the reconnection process is studied. The scaling of the reconnection timescale with the Reynolds number is obtained. At high Reynolds numbers the reconnection process leads to a breakdown of the entire <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> structure to a turbulent-like ow. This phenomenon is shown to be related to the mechanics of the reconnection process. Finally, the dynamics of <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> with swirl in unbounded ow is studied. Two different types of <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> with swirl were considered: i) <b>Vortex</b> <b>rings</b> with Gaussian distributions of core azimuthal vorticity and core azimuthal velocity and ii) Steady state solutions of the Euler equations for <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> with swirl. Both types of <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> develop an elongated axial vortex after initialisation. The existence of a maximum limit for the swirl on a <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> is shown above which the <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> undergo a rapid de-swirling readjustment.

40|$|Abstract—The {{spreading}} {{characteristics of}} acoustically excited swirling double-concentric jets were studied experimentally. The central jet was acoustically excited at {{low and high}} pulsation intensities. A smoke wire flow visualization and a hot-wire anemometer velocity measurement results show that excitation forces a <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> to roll-up {{from the edge of}} the central tube during each excitation period. At low pulsation intensities, the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> evolves downstream, and eventually breaks up into turbulent eddies. At high pulsation intensities, the primary <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> evolves and a series of trailing <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> form during the same period of excitation. The trailing <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> accelerate while evolving downstream and overtake the primary <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> within the same cycle.

In this study, a multiple-relaxation time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is used to investigate the flow of a <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> impacting spheroidal particles. The MRT-LBM is validated through the cases of <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> impacting a flat wall. The vortex evolution due to particle size, the aspect ratio of a prolate particle, as well as Reynolds (Re) number are discussed in detail.

40|$|We {{present a}} new model for an {{axisymmetric}} <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> confined in a tube.

The new model offers a more accurate description of the deformation of the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> core, induced by the lateral wall, and a better approximation of the translational velocity of the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring,</b> compared with the previous model. The main ingredients of the model are the following: the description of the vorticity distribution in the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> is based on the previous model of unconfined elliptical-core <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> [Kaplanski, Fukumoto and Rudi, Physics of Fluids, 24, 2012]; Brasseur's approach [Brasseur, PhD Thesis, 1979] is then applied to derive a wall-induced correction for the Stokes stream function of the confined <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> flow. We derive closed formulae for the flow stream function and vorticity distribution. An asymptotic expression for the long time evolution of the drift velocity of the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> {{as a function of the}} ellipticity parameter is also derived. The predictions of the model are shown to be in agreement with direct numerical simulations of confined <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> generated by a piston-cylinder mechanism. The predictions of the model support the recently suggested heuristic relation [Krieg andMohseni, J.

A model describing {{the process is}} proposed and a physical explanation based on the Kelvin–Benjamin variational principle for steady <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> is provided. It is shown that Lundgren et al.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> moving orthogonally to the rotation vector of a uniformly rotating fluid is analysed by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. In the rotating system the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> describes a curved trajectory, {{turning in the}} opposite sense to the system's anti-clockwise rotation. This behaviour has been explained by using the analogy with the motion of a sphere in a rotating fluid for which Proudman (1916) computed the forces acting on the body surface. Measurements have revealed that the angular velocity of the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> in its curved trajectory is opposite to the background rotation rate, so that the vortex has a fixed orientation in an inertial frame of reference and that the curvature increases proportionally to the rotation rate. The {{dynamics of}} the vorticity of the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> {{is affected by the}} background rotation {{in such a way that}} the part of the vortex core in clockwise rotation shrinks while the anti-clockwise-rotating core part widens. By this opposite forcing on either side of the vortex core Kelvin waves are excited, travelling along the toroidal axis of the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring,</b> with a net mass flow which is responsible for the accumulation of passive scalars on the anti-clockwise-rotating core part. In addition, the curved motion of the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> modifies its self-induced strain field, resulting in stripping of vorticity filaments at the front of the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> from the anti-clockwise-rotating core part and at the rear from the core part in clockwise rotation. Vortex lines, being deflected by the main <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> due to induction of relative vorticity, are stretched by the local straining field and form a horizontally extending vortex pair behind the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring.</b> This <b>vortex</b> pair propagates by its self-induced motion towards the clockwise-rotating side of the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> and thus contributes to the deformation of the ring core. The deflection of vortex lines from the main <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> persists during the whole motion and is responsible for the gradual erosion of the coherent toroidal structure of the initial <b>vortex</b> <b>ring...</b>|$|R

40|$|Of {{particular}} {{importance to the}} development of models for isolated <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> dynamics in a real fluid is knowledge of ambient fluid entrainment by the ring. This time-dependent process dictates changes in the volume of fluid that must share impulse delivered by the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> generator. Therefore fluid entrainment is also of immediate significance to the unsteady forces that arise due to the presence of <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> in starting flows. Applications ranging from industrial and transportation, to animal locomotion and cardiac flows, are currently being investigated to understand the dynamical role of the observed <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> structures.

These models constitute more realistic approximations to experimental <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> and dipoles than the single-contour models of Norbury and Pierrehumbert, and nested contour dynamics algorithms allow their simulation with low computational cost. In two dimensions, nested-contour models for the analytical Lamb dipole are constructed. In the axisymmetric case, a family of models for <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> generated by a piston–cylinder apparatus at different stroke ratios is constructed from experimental data.

Utilizing a piston/cylinder arrangement {{in a water}} tank, the velocity and vorticity fields of <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> are obtained using digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) {{for a wide range}} of piston stroke to diameter (L/D) ratios. The results indicate that the flow field generated by large L/D consists of a leading <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> followed by a trailing jet. The vorticity field of the leading <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> formed is disconnected from that of the trailing jet. On the other hand, flow fields generated by small stroke ratios show only a single <b>vortex</b> <b>ring.</b> The transition between these two distinct states is observed to occur at a stroke ratio of approximately 4, which, in this paper, is referred to as the ‘formation number’. In all cases, the maximum circulation that a <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> can attain during its formation is reached at this non-dimensional time or formation number. The universality of this number was tested by generating <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> with different jet exit diameters and boundaries, as well as with various non-impulsive piston velocities.

40|$|The {{recent work}} of Gharib, Rambod, and Shariff [J. Fluid Mech. 360, 121 (1998) ] studied <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> formed by {{starting}} jets generated using a piston-cylinder mechanism. Their {{results showed that}} <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> generated from starting jets stop forming and pinch off from the generating jet for sufficiently large values of the piston stroke to diameter ratio (L/D), suggesting a maximization principle may exist for propulsion utilizing starting jets. The importance of <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> formation and pinch off to propulsion, however, rests on the relative contribution of the leading <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> and the trailing jet (which appears after pinch off) to the impulse supplied to the flow. To resolve {{the relative importance of}} the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> and trailing jet for propulsion, a piston-cylinder mechanism attached to a force balance is used to investigate the impulse and thrust generated by starting jets for L/D ratios in the range 2 – 8. Two different velocity programs are used, providing two different L/D values beyond which pinch off is observed, {{in order to determine the}} effect of <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> pinch off. Measurements of the impulse associated with <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> formation show it to be much larger than that expected from the jet velocity alone and proportionally larger than that associated with a trailing jet for L/D large enough to observe pinch off. The latter result leads to a local maximum in the average thrust during a pulse near L/D values associated with <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> whose circulation has been maximized. These results are shown to be related to the nozzle exit over-pressure generated during <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> formation.

The existence of this limit is known to lead to the separation of a growing <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> from the shear layer feeding it, a process known as `vortex pinch-off', and characterized by the dimensionless vortex formation number. The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of vortex pinch-off as it relates to biological propulsion, and to provide future researchers with tools to assist in identifying and predicting pinch-off in biological flows. To this end, we introduce a method for identifying pinch-off in starting jets using the Lagrangian coherent structures in the flow, and apply this criterion to an experimentally generated starting jet. Since most naturally occurring <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> are not circular, we extend the definition of the vortex formation number to include non-axisymmetric <b>vortex</b> <b>rings,</b> and find that the formation number for moderately non-axisymmetric vortices {{is similar to that of}} circular <b>vortex</b> <b>rings.</b> This suggests that naturally occurring <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> may be modeled as axisymmetric <b>vortex</b> <b>rings.</b> Therefore, we consider the perturbation response of the Norbury family of axisymmetric <b>vortex</b> <b>rings.</b> This family is chosen to model <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> of increasing thickness and circulation, and their response to prolate shape perturbations is simulated using contour dynamics. Finally, the response of more realistic models for <b>vortex</b> <b>rings,</b> constructed from experimental data using nested contours, to perturbations which resemble those encountered by forming vortices more closely, is simulated using contour dynamics. In both families of models, a change in response analogous to pinch-off is found as members of the family with progressively thicker cores are considered. We posit that this analogy may be exploited to understand and predict pinch-off in complex biological flows, where current methods are not applicable in practice, and criteria based on the properties of <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> alone are necessary. </p...|$|R

The experiments {{examine the effect of}} <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> strength and the thickness of the middle layer on the evolution of the flow. A wide range of phenomena is observed. In particular, we show that at some conditions the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> enters the top layer without bringing with it fluid from the middle layer. At higher Weber numbers, the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> engulfs fluid from the middle layer and forms a drop of liquid from the lower layer coated with fluid from the middle layer. (Author...|$|R
40|$|The <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> {{formation}} {{process of}} a starting buoyant plume was studied experimentally using digital particle image thermometry and velocimetry (DPITV). The <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> was observed to pinch-off, or become disconnected, from the trailing plume. Pinch-off occurred at non-dimensional times, or formation numbers, between 4. 4 and 4. 9. The observed pinch-off process {{is consistent with}} an explanation based upon the Kelvin–Benjamin variational principle. This {{is analogous to the}} pinch-off of a <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> generated using a piston–cylinder apparatus, suggesting that pinch-off is a general component of the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> formation process for various generation mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the relationship between the}} pinch-off of axisymmetric <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> and the evolution of pressure in the shear layer being entrained into the <b>vortex</b> <b>rings.</b> A piston-cylinder apparatus was used to generate the <b>vortex</b> <b>rings,</b> and five cases of constant piston acceleration over distances ranging from zero (impulsive start) to eight piston diameters were investigated. It was determined that increasing the distance over which the piston accelerated increased the dimensionless formation time at which the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> pinches off, consistent with previous observations. A limiting value of <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> formation number of approximately seven is approached when the piston is accelerated over more than six piston diameters. For each case, the evolution of pressure in the shear layer was calculated based on PIV measurements of the velocity field and spatial integration of the corresponding pressure gradients using a recently developed algorithm. Plots of the shear layer pressure in X-T diagrams aided in identifying key features of the pressure associated with the evolution of <b>vortex</b> <b>rings,</b> including a high-pressure region that forms behind the leading ring. By extrapolating the motion of this high-pressure region back to the nozzle exit plane in the X-T diagram, its time of first appearance can be estimated. It is found that the appearance of the extrapolated local pressure maximum in the shear layer at the nozzle exit plane coincides with <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> pinch-off, as conventionally quantified by the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> formation number...|$|R
