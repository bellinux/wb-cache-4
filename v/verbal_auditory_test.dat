40|$|Background and Aim: Cerebrovascular {{accident}} is {{a neurological}} disorder involves central nervous system. Studies {{have shown that}} it affects the outputs of behavioral <b>auditory</b> <b>tests</b> such as dichotic <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> memory <b>test.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare this memory test results between patients with cerebrovascular accident and normal subjects. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 20 patients with cerebrovascular accident aged 50 - 70 years and 20 controls matched for age and gender in Emam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Dichotic <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> memory <b>test</b> was performed on each subject. Results: The mean score in the two groups was significantly different (p< 0. 0001). The results indicated that the right-ear score was significantly greater than the left-ear score in normal subjects (p< 0. 0001) and in patients with right hemisphere lesion (p< 0. 0001). The right-ear and left-ear scores were not significantly different in patients with left hemisphere lesion (p= 0. 0860). Conclusion: Among other methods, Dichotic <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> memory <b>test</b> is a beneficial test in assessing the central auditory nervous system of patients with cerebrovascular accident.

40|$|Objectives: Previous {{investigations}} {{have demonstrated that}} blood glucose might {{play a role in}} the action of some aspects of cognitive performance in adults of various age ranges. Generally these studies have used a procedure where participants were tested after administration of a glucose drink. The aims of the study, was to investigate the glucose cognitive facilitation affects under more natural conditions of breakfast consumption or early morning fasting. Method: 20 participants with a mean age of 50. 4 years (± 4. 22) were studied. Measures of <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> learning, executive function, visual attention and motor speed were compared following overnight fasting and after breakfast consumption with presumed elevation of glyceamic conditions Results: There was a significant difference under the two conditions (overnight fasting vs., breakfast consumption) on time taken to complete the motor speed test (p< 0. 0005). There was also a significant condition effect on the amount of words recalled immediately on the <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> learning <b>test</b> (p< 0. 005) and the time taken to complete a simple executive function test (p< 0. 0005). There was no significant effect on delayed word call on the <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> learning <b>test,</b> attention test or the more complex executive function test. Changes in cognitive performance were significantly correlated with levels of blood glucose. Conclusion: The results of the study support the hypothesis that during neuropsychological testing, capacities of cognitive performance were inversely affected by early morning fasting and may have an impact on work place safety...|$|R

40|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>Verbal</b> Learning <b>Tests</b> {{have been}} used for many decades to assess human memory {{functions}} and item recall, namely primacy and recency effects. The Affective <b>Auditory</b> <b>Verbal</b> Learning Test was created by Snyder and Harrison (1997) to provide an objective measure of <b>auditory</b> affective <b>verbal</b> processing. The current study recruited participants (N= 90) to replicate Snyder and Harrison 2 ̆ 7 s original experiment; however, rather than using primarily Caucasian males students as they did, participants were primarily African-American males and females.

Method: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 400 children of pre-school classes affiliated to Education and Welfare organizations in Semnan city were selected randomly. Required data were gathered by using a questionnaire and performing <b>verbal</b> – <b>auditory</b> skills <b>tests.</b> Results: The obtained means were as follows: monosyllable non word repetition: 3. 28, 4 syllabic non word repetition: 1. 17, syllable recognition: 10. 27, syllable segmentation: 3. 04, syllable blending: 3. 20, alliteration (word with same starter phoneme) recognition: 0. 92 and production of word with same starter phoneme: 0. 54.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether stroke {{risk factors and}} cognitive dysfunction are concomitant in individuals {{over the age of}} 60. Methods: The cognitive abilities of elderly individuals with different degrees of risk as per the Framingham stroke risk profile were compared. The Framingham stroke risk profile was used to calculate the risk of an ischemic cerebral event. Neuropsychological tests included the Buschke Selective Reminding Test, verbal fluency (animals), clock drawing, Rey <b>Auditory</b> <b>Verbal</b> Learning, digit span and vocabulary. A random and typical population sample was used in the study, selected from the 200 elderly residents in the area surrounding the primary health care facility (Morada das Flores Clinic, Porto Alegre). Forty-six elderly individuals were included in the study. Results: The elderly individuals with a risk profile, had lower memory test performance levels (NF, p= 0. 02) and planning capacity (clock drawing test, p= 0. 03).

40|$|Objectives: Identification {{of early}} Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {{has become very}} important. Episodic memory tasks appear to have {{predictive}} power for indicating early AD. Deficits in encoding and storage processes that are characteristic of AD, however, must be distinguished from non-AD deficits that can also affect memory, including difficulties that may be present in depression. This pilot study {{was set up to}} ascertain whether a 10 - word-list-learning task (delayed recognition and rate of forgetting) may be useful in making the differentiation between mild AD and depression. Method: A Dutch version of Rey’s <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> learning <b>test</b> was administered to 36 mild AD patients, 41 depressed patients, and 47 healthy controls.

Since aging has different effects on different memorial systems and little studies have investigated auditory-verbal memory function in older adults using dichotic listening techniques, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the auditory-verbal memory function among old people using Persian version of dichotic auditory-verbal memory test. Methods: The Persian version of dichotic auditory-verbal memory test was administered to 23 old people ranging 60 - 80 years and 30 young people aging 20 - 30 years, with normal and symmetric hearing in both ears. The performance of the two groups was compared. Results: The mean score of young (6. 36 ± 0. 43) and old (4. 58 ± 0. 74) adults on dichotic auditory-verbal memory test were significantly difference (p= 0. 001). The correlation test showed a negative correlation between age and the memory scores in aged people (r= 0. 36). A significant difference in recall of early (p= 0. 034), middle (p= 0. 037), and final (p= 0. 041) words was seen between aged and young people.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Decreasing serotonergic {{neurotransmission}} {{in humans}} {{has been found}} to impair memory consolidation. Such effects may be relevant to the memory deficits seen in major depression and the cognitive actions of antidepressant drugs used to treat them. However, the improvement in cognitive function often found following successful pharmacological treatment in depression may be confounded by symptom improvement. RATIONALE: The present study assessed the effects of an acute challenge with the selective serotonergic re-uptake inhibitor citalopram in healthy (non-depressed) females. METHODS: Immediate and delayed recall/recognition was assessed using the <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> learning <b>test</b> following 10 mg (intravenous) citalopram or placebo in a double-blind between groups design. RESULTS: Immediate recall on the verbal memory test was unaffected by citalopram administration. However, volunteers receiving citalopram showed enhanced long-term memory performance in terms of delayed recall and recognition relative to those receiving placebo. Sustained attention performance was also comparable in the two groups of subjects suggesting that non-specific increases in information processing are not responsible for this effect. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that augmentation of serotonergic neurotransmission is associated with increased memory consolidation, which may be relevant to its therapeutic and cognitive actions in acutely depressed patients...|$|R

Retirement villages were randomized to receive pre-prepared frozen meals containing either pork or chicken. Dietary intake was assessed by three-day food records and cognitive domains assessed using validated tests. Hand grip strength was measured and lower extremity performance assessed by the sit-to-stand test, get-up-and-go test and six-minute walk test. Forty-eight volunteers participated (78. 2 ± 6. 2 y). In linear mixed models, controlling for baseline physical activity and dietary protein and energy intake, no differences were found between pork (n = 19) and chicken (n = 12) groups. The chicken group had improved Rey <b>Auditory</b> <b>Verbal</b> Learning <b>test</b> scores (verbal learning and memory) at six weeks (p 3 ̆c 0. 001).

We aimed to assess the relationship between insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) and cognitive functions in early, drug-naïve patients with PD. METHODS: Serum IGF- 1 was measured in 65 early, drug-naïve patients with PD that underwent a complete neuropsychological battery at baseline and after 2  years. Linear regression {{analysis was used to}} evaluate the relationships between neuropsychological scores and IGF- 1. Repeated-measures anova was applied to assess changes in neuropsychological variables over time. RESULTS: At baseline, IGF- 1 levels were related to phonological fluency. At follow-up, IGF- 1 levels were associated with the Rey <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> learning <b>test</b> (RAVLT) - immediate and delayed recall, Frontal Assessment Battery, verbal span and Benton judgement of the line orientation test. Patients with low IGF- 1 levels at baseline showed a significantly faster decline of performances than patients with high IGF- 1 levels on immediate and delayed recall of the RAVLT and interference task of the Stroop test.

MethodsInclusion criteria were a diagnosis of LKS with: (1) acquired aphasia or <b>verbal</b> <b>auditory</b> aphasia; (2) with or without focal seizures, secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, absences, or atonic seizures. ResultsMean follow-up was 12 years. All cases except six had seizures. Before the onset of aphasia, developmental language and behavioral disturbances were present in 19 and 14 patients, respectively. All patients had <b>verbal</b> <b>auditory</b> agnosia. Aphasia was severe in 24 patients and moderate in five. Nonlinguistic cognitive dysfunctions were moderate in 14 patients. Behavioral disturbances were found in 16 patients. During the continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow sleep phase, the spike-wave index was > 85 % in 15, 50 – 85 % in eight, and 30 – 50 % in four. In two patients, the EEG recording showed occasional bilateral spikes, without continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow sleep. In this phase, the awake EEG recording showed more frequent interictal abnormalities, predominantly in the temporal regions. Eight patients recovered language completely, but the remaining patients continue to have language deficits of different degrees.

Many of the basic auditory processing measures in our test battery correlated significantly with receptive and language scores, suggesting a (causal) relationship between auditory processing and language proficiency. Results from discriminant function analyses do not warrant deleting one or more tests from the test battery yet (with the exception of the <b>auditory</b> synthesis <b>test</b> and the temporal integration test, for which we did not find significant group effects). At present, we are conducting experiments with older (SLI and control) children and adults to find whether the significant performance deficits of the SLI children are also found in older SLI children, and to determine the influence of maturational effects on these <b>auditory</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
