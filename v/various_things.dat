In plant cells, the Golgi produces pectins and other polysaccharides needed by the plant structure.|$|E

By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints.

25|$|The Germanic law {{codes are}} {{designed}} for a clearly stratified society fixated on castes determined by descent or kinship. Legal status, and therefore freedom, {{was based on a}} person's caste, discriminating between royals and two or three successive castes of nobility, where the lower were reckoned as peasants or freemen (OE freo man, OHG frīhals), and those who are laymen, or bondmen (ON þræll). Accordingly, descent (nativitate) was determining who would attend the <b>various</b> <b>things</b> (house-things, local things, regional things and inter-regional or royal things). Thus the bondmen were ipso facto represented by their family-heads - the local nobility - on the regional things of the nobles. The same differentiation (in castes) defined who could convey and inherit property. In regulation of tribal feuds and weregeld a similar discrimination is seen.|$|E
