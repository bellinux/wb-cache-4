40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical investigation of paint reconstructions prepared with linseed oil that have undergone typical 19 th century treatments {{in preparation for}} painting. The oil was mechanically extracted from the same seed lot, which was then processed by various methods: water washing, heat treatments, {{and the addition of}} driers, with and without heat. A modern process lead white (Dutch source, Schoonhoven) and a commercially available <b>vine</b> <b>black</b> were used as pigments. The reconstructions were prepared in 1999, and naturally aged from then onwards. We compared thermogravimetric analysis (TG), which yields macromolecular information, with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and direct exposure mass spectrometry (DEMS), which both provide molecular information. The study enabled us to quantitatively demonstrate, for the first time, that the parameters used to identify drying oils are deeply influenced by the history of the paint. In particular, here we show that the ratio between the relative amounts of palmitic and stearic acid (P/S), which is used as an index for differentiating between drying oils, is extremely dependent on the pigments present and the age of the paint. Moreover the study revealed that neither the P/S parameter nor the ratios between the relative amounts of the various dicarboxylic acids (azelaic over suberic and azelaic over sebacic) can be used to trace the sorts of pre-treatment undergone by the oil investigated in this study. The final results represent an important milestone for the scientific community working in the field, highlighting that further research is still necessary to solve the identification o...|$|E

40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} (EPN) and entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) are pathogens {{which require}} an insect host to fulfil their life cycle and {{are commonly used}} as biocontrol agents. Studies have shown {{that a combination of}} EPN and EPF can result in greater insect mortality when compared to the agents applied alone. This interaction could possibly reduce the cost and quantities of single dose applications, inferring a synergistic effect. However, combinations of these pathogens may also result in additive or antagonistic interactions which would be of no benefit to growers. Hylobius abietis (large pine weevil) and Otiorhynchus sulcatus (<b>black</b> <b>vine</b> weevil) cause economic damage to forestry and horticultural crops, respectively. Large pine weevil larvae develop in the tree stumps, emerge as adults and feed on the bark of newly planted saplings, causing extensive mortality. <b>Black</b> <b>vine</b> weevil larvae kill plants by feeding on the roots and adults cause cosmetic damage. In this investigation, laboratory and field trials were conducted against large pine weevil larvae to determine whether interactions occur if EPN and EPF were applied simultaneously. EPN and EPF have already been shown to interact synergistically against the vine weevil in laboratory conditions. These experiments were repeated to investigate if synergistic interactions could be reproduced. Synergistic interactions were found with EPN and EPF against the large pine weevil in some laboratory experiments. However, antagonism and additivity were also recorded and synergism could not be predictably achieved. The field trial against the large pine weevil resulted in additivity. This indicates that the combined application of EPN and EPF would not be a better option than single applications. Initial interaction experiments against the <b>black</b> <b>vine</b> weevil did not show similar results to previous publications. However, larvae used in previous publications were younger than in this investigation which may indicate that interactions are dependent on larval age...|$|R

[...] Alders play a particularly important role, as alders establish symbioses with the nitrogen-fixing Actinobacteria (Frankiella alni). This bacteria converts atmospheric nitrogen into soil-soluble nitrates which can be utilised by the alder, and favorably enhances the soil fertility generally.

40|$|Resistance to the <b>black</b> <b>vine</b> weevil, Otiorhynchus sulcatus (F.) in in rhododendrons was {{examined}} {{on the basis}} of leaf type. Indumented (hairy) and lepitode (scaly) rhododendrons were compared to glabrous (clear leaf) rhododendrons for feeding damage and egg production. A screening study of Taxus cultivars for resistance to the weevil was also conducted. Weevil preference for rhododendrons was tested in an open bed by measuring leaf damage and by counting larvae on the roots {{at the end of the}} study. Weevils were also confined on individual plants and leaf damage, frass production, and egg production were measured each week. The preference study showed that indumented and lepitode rhododendrons had less feeding damage than glabrous rhododendrons. However, there were wide differences within groups. The confined study showed that indumented rhododendrons generally had less leaf surf ace removed than the lepidote and glabrous rhododendrons. The frass production results showed few differences by leaf group. The indumented cross R. smirnowii x R. yakusimanum supported the lowest egg production and was significantly different from all rhododendrons tested. The indumented rhododendrons R. smirnowii and R. yakusimanum were significantly different from the glabrous rhododendrons in the number of eggs produced by weevils confined to these hosts.
