40|$|Persistently {{infected}} animals (PI animals), that is those animals born after an intrauterine {{infection of the}} dam during the first 120 days of gestation, are {{the main source of}} bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVD virus) in a cattle population. The success of any BVD virus eradication programme depends on the ability to detect all PI animals at a young age. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the use of the antigen ELISA test and the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for the diagnosis of PI animals in the presence of maternal antibodies, and to compare them with the classical <b>virus</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>test.</b> In this experiment, 25 calves born after an experimental infection with a mixture of BVD virus field strains were used. All calves were found to be positive for BVD virus using the <b>virus</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>test,</b> both before the ingestion of colostrum and again at 10 weeks of age. Both the <b>virus</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> and the antigen ELISA test were shown to be unreliable indicators for the diagnosis of persistent infections with BVD virus, when used in the presence of high levels of maternal antibodies. However, the RT-PCR test gave positive results even in the presence of high maternal antibody titres, indicating the suitability of the RT-PCR test for use in eradication programmes...|$|E
40|$|Capillary {{blood samples}} from 63 infants {{collected}} 3 - 7 days after birth, and thereafter stored on filter papers for 12 - 18 y, were {{tested for the}} presence of CMV DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Of 16 infants with proven congenital CMV infection (positive <b>virus</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> in urine sampled within 1 week of age), 13 (81 %) had a positive CMV PCR test and 3 (19 %) a negative PCR test.

When 31 samples on filter papers stored above or below the samples of the infected infants were tested, 6 (19 %) had a weak reactivity. This suggests that CMV DNA can be transferred from one filter paper to another during storage. We conclude that PCR performed on dried blood stored on filter paper is a useful method in the retrospective diagnostics of congenital CMV infection. Consideration must be given, however, to the possibility of transfer of CMV DNA from blood samples stored nearby...|$|E

Infection was detected by virological methods, using a virus neutralisation test (VNT) for EAV antibody detection in serum samples, and virus isolation and RT-PCR test for virus detection in semen. No clinical picture of the disease was observed. The highest seroprevalence (nearly 100 %) was among stallions and old mares, while seroprevalence among young fillies, before mating, was lower than 9 %.

A microtiter <b>virus</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> {{was used to determine}} the {{prevalence of}} calves viremic with BVDV on entry to the feedlot. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which detects antibody against glycoprotein 53 of the BVDV was used on paired sera to determine the seroconversion risk during the first 96 d in the feedlot. A virus neutralization (VN) test for BVDV was conducted on a sub-sample of paired sera to measure agreement in determination of seroconversion risk with the ELISA. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test which detects BVDV was used to determine if cattle were acutely viremic when treated for disease. The estimated prevalence of persistently infected calves in this population was < 0. 1 %. The seroconversion risk for BVDV was 27 % (236 / 864) according to the ELISA and it varied from 0 to 63 % among the 20 pens sampled. According to the VN test, the seroconversion risk for BVDV was 40 % (132 / 327) and it varied from 0 to 100 % among the 11 pens tested.

Additionally, in order to investigate the serological response of the chickens and produce WNV monospecific antibodies, serum samples were collected from the birds during the trial and analysed for antibodies by virus neutralisation (VN) and plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT). No clinical signs or gross pathological changes were seen in any of the inoculated chickens throughout the study. The nested PCR used in the study appeared to be significantly more sensitive at detecting the presence of the virus in both the tissues and the inoculated Vero cell cultures compared to the detection of gross cytopathic changes as observed in infected Vero cell culture. No cytopathic changes were seen in the inoculated avian cell cultures. Following primary inoculation of the chickens there was a weak antibody response 15 days post inoculation, however following reinoculation with inactivated WNV and adjuvant there was a substantial increase in the neutralising antibody titres when tested two weeks later.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to develop two new {{independent}} SYBR Green I-based real-time PCR assays for both detection and quantification of betanodavirus, an RNA virus that infects several species of marine teleost fish causing massive mortalities in larvae and juveniles. The assays utilized two pairs of primers targeting highly conserved regions of both the RNA molecules forming the betanodavirus genome: RNA 1 encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and RNA 2 encoding the coat protein (CP). The specificity of amplifications was monitored by the melting analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis of the amplified products. The applicability of these assays was confirmed with 21 betanodavirus strains, covering all the four main clades. In addition, a BLAST (NCBI) search with the primer sequences showed no genomic cross-reactivity with other viruses. The new assays were able to quantify concentrations of betanodavirus genes ranging from 10 (1) to 10 (8) copies per reaction. The intra-assay coefficients of variation (CV) of threshold cycle (Ct) values of the assays were 1. 5 % and 1. 4 % for CP and RdRP RNAs, respectively. The inter-assay CVs of Ct values were 2. 3 % and 2. 4 % for CP and RdRP RNAs, respectively. Moreover, regression analysis showed a significant correlation (R 2 > 0. 97) between genome number, as determined by real-time PCR assays and the corresponding virus titer expressed as TCID 50 /ml of two different betanodavirus strains propagated in cell culture. The two assays were compared with a previously established one-step RT-PCR assay and with the classical <b>virus</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> and {{found to be more}} sensitive.

The cDNA sequence analysis of V 3 -domain of HIV- 1 isolated from patient sera also revealed that the high-responder against PNDмɴ-peptide well conserved the original sequence. Further, based on the determination of anti-PNDмɴ Ab (MN- Ab) titer during the past 10 years, 35 HIV- 1 -infected Japanese hemophiliacs with a well-characterized natural history were categorized. Group 1 : MN-Ab was consistently negative (100). Patients of group 1 were further divided into two subgroups based on CD 4 -positive cell count; namely, subgroup 1 a and subgroup 1 b.

40|$|The {{quantity}} and serotypes of enteroviruses (EVs) in the influent {{of a local}} sewage treatment plant were compared to local clinical EV cases to determine if testing of sewage is adequate for an EV surveillance system. The study was carried out from August 1994 to December 2002. Monthly influent specimens were processed by organic flocculation, and dilutions of concentrate were inoculated onto {{a number of different}} cell types for <b>virus</b> <b>isolation.</b> EVs were detected in 88 of 100 monthly influent samples. Sewage EV titers were calculated by using software provided by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency for most-probable-number determination. All 1, 068 sewage EV isolates were further grouped (echovirus, coxsackievirus B, coxsackievirus A, or poliovirus) by cell culture host range analysis (growth pattern of isolates on passage to seven cell lines), and 39. 0 % of the 1, 022 EV isolates categorized as non-poliovirus EVs were specifically serotyped. For clinical cases, primary <b>virus</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>tests</b> were performed on specimens submitted by local hospitals and EV isolates submitted by hospitals were serotyped. Clinical EVs were documented for 81 of the 100 months studied. In all, 694 EV isolates from clinical cases were serotyped. Annually, between 4 and 11 different serotypes of non-poliovirus EVs were identified in sewage and from 9 to 19 different non-poliovirus EV serotypes were identified from clinical specimens. Usually, the most commonly detected sewage EV serotypes were similar to the most commonly detected clinical serotypes; e. g., for 1997, echovirus 6 accounted for 53. 1 % of the typed sewage isolates and 39. 4 % of the clinical infections, while in 1998, echovirus 30 accounted for 50. 0 and 46. 1 %, respectively. In 1999, 60. 3 % of the EVs from clinical cases and 79. 7 % of the sewage isolates were echovirus 11; in 2000, 33. 3 % of the EVs from clinical cases and 40. 7 % of the sewage isolates were coxsackievirus B 5; and in 2001, 44. 1 % of the EVs from clinical cases and 36. 2 % of the sewage isolates were echovirus 13. Annual peaks of both sewage EV titers and clinical cases occurred in late summer or early fall. In some years, early spring sewage EVs portended some of the EVs that would predominate clinically during the following summer...|$|R
40|$|Background: An {{epidemic}} of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) {{has been associated}} with an outbreak of atypical pneumonia originating in Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China. We aimed to identify the causative agent in the Guangdong outbreak and describe the emergence and spread of the disease within the province. Methods: We analysed epidemiological information and collected serum and nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with SARS in Guangdong in mid-February, 2003. We did <b>virus</b> <b>isolation,</b> serological <b>tests,</b> and molecular assays to identify the causative agent. Findings: SARS had been circulating in other cities of Guangdong Province for about 2 months before causing a major outbreak in Guangzhou, the province's capital. A novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (CoV), was isolated from specimens from three patients with SARS. Viral antigens were also directly detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from these patients. 48 of 55 (87 %) patients had antibodies to SARS CoV in their convalescent sera. Genetic analysis showed that the SARS CoV isolates from Guangzhou shared the same origin with those in other countries, and had a phylogenetic pathway that matched the spread of SARS to the other parts of the world. Interpretation: SARS CoV is the infectious agent responsible for the epidemic outbreak of SARS in Guangdong. The virus isolated from patients in Guangdong is the prototype of the SARS CoV in other regions and countries. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background In 2012, equine {{influenza}} (EI) virus was confirmed {{as the cause}} of outbreaks of respiratory disease in horses throughout South America. In Uruguay and Argentina, hundreds of vaccinated thoroughbred horses in training and racing facilities were clinically affected. Objective To characterise the EI viruses detected during the outbreak in Uruguay and Argentina. Methods Virus was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs by a pan-reactive influenza type A real-time RT-PCR. The nucleotide sequence of the HA 1 gene was determined and analysed phylogenetically using MEGA 5 software. Amino acid sequences alignments were constructed and virus was antigenically characterised with specific ferret antisera. Paired serum samples were tested by haemagglutination inhibition and single radial haemolysis. Results The diagnosis of EIV was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, <b>virus</b> <b>isolation</b> and serological <b>testing.</b> The phylogenetic analysis of HA 1 gene sequences of 18 EI viruses indicated that all of them belong to clade 1 of the Florida sublineage of the American lineage and are closely related to viruses isolated in the United States in 2012. The HA 1 of viruses identified in horses in racing facilities i...|$|R
40|$|Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are {{the major}} causes {{of a variety of}} acute illnesses. <b>Virus</b> <b>isolation</b> and {{neutralization}} <b>tests</b> are usually done to identify the causative virus, but these tests are labor-intensive and time-consuming, and standardized antisera are in limited supply. This study investigated a rapid and reliable method of virus identification based on PCR and phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic tree constructed by neighbor joining {{on the basis of the}} newly determined partial hexon sequences from 33 prototypes of HAdV-D and -E, along with 11 available prototypes of HAdV-A to -C and -F from GenBank, allowed HAdVs to be grouped into six distinct clusters. These clusters correspond closely to the six newly designated species, HAdV-A to -F. The partial hexon sequences of 57 isolates from patients with acute conjunctivitis obtained over 20 years plus those of 44 prototype strains were analyzed. Each isolate formed a monophyletic cluster along with its respective prototype strain, allowing serotype identification. Partial-hexon-based classification appears to be an effective tool for studying the molecular epidemiology of HAdVs...|$|R
40|$|Eighty dogs exhibiting {{clinical}} signs of respiratory disease were sampled for influenza <b>virus</b> <b>isolation</b> and serologically <b>tested</b> for hemagglutination inhibiting antibody to influenza A/Hong Kong/ 68, A/Victoria/ 75, A/Texas/ 77 and A/USSR/ 77. Forty-one animals without {{clinical signs}} of respiratory disease were also examined serologically. Hemagglutinating agents were isolated from nasal and/or pharyngeal swabs taken from 21 of the 80 dogs with clinical respiratory disease. Twenty of these 21 isolates were canine parainfluenza virus. Twenty-one of 80 clinically ill animals (26. 3 %) and eight of 41 normal animals (19. 5 %) had low level hemagglutination inhibiting antibody to influenza A/Texas/ 77. There {{was no evidence}} that human influenza caused the respiratory disease in the dogs included in this study, since none had an increase in hemagglutination inhibiting antibody to influenza in convalescent sera. The presence of antibody to A/Texas/ 77, however, does suggest the possibility that these dogs had at some time been infected with this virus, and that dogs could {{play a role in the}} epidemiology of influenza in man...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{aimed to}} observe the {{infection}} pattern of Bovine herpes virus- 1 (BoHV- 1) in dairy cattle with reproductive problems in Sudan. A total of 140 samples comprising of vaginal swab (n= 97), placenta (n= 15), whole blood (n= 19), uterine fluid (n= 1), and serum (n= 8) were collected from 16 dairy herds showing particularly high rate of abortion and infertility in Khartoum State. The samples were used for <b>virus</b> <b>isolation,</b> and were <b>tested</b> by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). No virus could be isolated from the samples inoculated for isolation in cell culture. Out of 80 specimens tested by ELISA, 7 (8. 75 %) {{were found to be}} positive, and one sample was doubtful. Using PCR, 11 (10. 7 %) out of 103 samples were found to be positive. When comparing between two methods for DNA extraction, the DNA extracted by commercial kit was found to be better in quality as compared to the DNA extracted using phenol/chloroform/isoamyl-alcohol method. The study confirmed the presence of BoHV- 1 in cattle farms with reproductive problems in Sudan...|$|R
40|$|Sunshine {{virus is}} a {{recently}} discovered novel paramyxovirus that {{is associated with}} illness in snakes. It does not phylogenetically cluster within either of the two currently accepted paramyxoviral subfamilies. It is therefore only distantly related to the only other known genus of reptilian paramyxoviruses, Ferlavirus, which clusters within the Paramyxovirinae subfamily. Clinical and diagnostic aspects associated with Sunshine virus are as yet undescribed. The objective of this paper was to report the clinical presentation, <b>virus</b> <b>isolation,</b> PCR <b>testing</b> and pathology associated with Sunshine virus infection. Clinical records and samples from naturally occurring cases were obtained from two captive snake collections and the archives of a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. The clinical signs that are associated with Sunshine virus infection are localised to the neurorespiratory systems or are non-specific (e. g. lethargy, inappetence). Out of 15 snakes that were infected with Sunshine virus (detected in any organ by either <b>virus</b> <b>isolation</b> or PCR), the virus was isolated from four out of ten (4 / 10) sampled brains, 3 / 10 sampled lungs and 2 / 7 pooled samples of kidney and liver. In these same 15 snakes, PCR was able to successfully detect Sunshine virus in fresh-frozen brain (11 / 11), kidney (7 / 8), lung (8 / 11) and liver (5 / 8); and various formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (7 / 8). During a natural outbreak of Sunshine virus in a collection of 32 snakes, the virus could be detected in five out of 39 combined oral-cloacal swabs that were collected from 23 of these snakes over a 105 day period. All snakes that were infected with Sunshine virus were negative for reovirus and ferlavirus by PCR. Snakes infected with Sunshine virus reliably exhibited hindbrain white matter spongiosis and gliosis with extension to the surrounding grey matter and neuronal necrosis evident in severe cases. Five out of eight infected snakes also exhibited mild bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Infection with Sunshine virus should be considered by veterinarians investigating disease outbreaks in snakes, particularly those that are associated with neurorespiratory disease...|$|R
40|$|Equid {{herpesvirus}} 1 (EHV 1) {{is a major}} {{disease of}} equids worldwide causing considerable losses to the horse industry. A variety of techniques, including PCR {{have been used to}} diagnose EHV 1. Some of these PCRs were used in combination with other techniques such as restriction enzyme analysis (REA) or hybridisation, making them cumbersome for routine diagnostic testing and increasing the chances of cross-contamination. Furthermore, they involve the use of suspected carcinogens such as ethidium bromide and ultraviolet light. In this paper, we describe a real-time PCR, which uses minor groove-binding probe (MGB) technology for the diagnosis of EHV 1. This technique does not require post-PCR manipulations thereby reducing the risk of cross-contamination. Most importantly, the technique is specific; it was able to differentiate EHV 1 from the closely related member of the Alphaherpesvirinae, equid herpesvirus 4 (EHV 4). It was not reactive with common opportunistic pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter agglomerans often involved in abortion. Similarly, it did not react with equine pathogens such as Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus equisimilis, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Taylorella equigenitalis and Rhodococcus equi, which also cause abortion. The results obtained with this technique agreed with results from published PCR methods. The assay was sensitive enough to detect EHV 1 sequences in paraffin-embedded tissues and clinical samples. When compared to <b>virus</b> <b>isolation,</b> the <b>test</b> was more sensitive. This test will be useful for the routine diagnosis of EHV 1 based on its specificity, sensitivity, ease of performance and rapidity...|$|R
