25|$|Herrings are pelagic feeders. Their prey {{consists}} of {{a wide spectrum of}} phytoplankton and zooplankton, amongst which copepods are the dominant prey. Young herring usually capture small copepods by hunting them individually— they approach them from below. The (half speed) <b>video</b> <b>loop</b> at the left shows a juvenile herring feeding on copepods. In the middle of the image a copepod escapes successfully to the left. The opercula (hard bony flaps covering the gills) are spread wide open to compensate the pressure wave which would alert the copepod to trigger a jump.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{a system}} called <b>Video</b> <b>Looping</b> is {{developed}} to analyze human cyclic motions. <b>Video</b> <b>Looping</b> {{allows users to}} extract human cyclic motion from a given video sequence. This system analyzes similarities from {{a large amount of}} live footage to find the point of smooth transition. The final cyclic loop is created using only a few output images. <b>Video</b> <b>Looping</b> is useful not only to learn and understand human movements, but also to apply the cyclic loop to various artistic applications. To provide practical animation references, the output images are presented as photo plate sequences to visualize human cyclic motion similar to Eadweard Muybridge's image sequences. The final output images can be used to create experimental projects such as composited multiple <b>video</b> <b>loops</b> or small size of web animations. Furthermore, they can be imported into animation packages, and animators can create keyframe animations by tracing them in 3 D software...|$|R

5000|$|Region-code enhanced, {{also known}} as just [...] "RCE" [...] or [...] "REA", was a {{retroactive}} attempt to prevent the playing of one region's discs in another region, even if the disc was played in a region-free player.

But it also contained a short <b>video</b> <b>loop</b> of a map of the world showing the regions, which was coded as region 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The intention was that when the disc was played in a non-region 1 player, the player would default to playing the material for its native region. This played the aforementioned <b>video</b> <b>loop</b> of a map, which was impossible to escape from, as the user controls were disabled.|$|E

40|$|I {{work with}} short-duration {{seamless}} <b>video</b> <b>loops.</b> My work simultaneously depicts and emulates the material composition of time, specifically how action composes time and how time can compose or construct objects. My work is self-reflexive. Self-reflexive {{means that a}} product actively considers or examines its own production. In video this means breaking either the illusion of depicted time as real time or the illusion of the depicted image as real space. <b>Video</b> <b>loops</b> are self-reflexive by function. Their periodic recurrence points out the artifact of the medium. The periodic recurrence of <b>video</b> <b>loops</b> also changes the narrative quality of the moving image. Eliminating {{the beginning and end}} of videos, making them indefinite, calls the viewer into a suspended narrative. By making that narrative about the material composition of time, I add another layer of reflexivity. A study of the material composition of time also raises the question of the relative metaphysical position of the moment “now” within time. By building this system of inter-connected reflexive relationships around time, I am attempting to create an atmosphere for meditation on and consideration of the self-reflexive nature of our own self-awareness, which philosopher Johann Fichte describes as such: “The self 2 ̆ 7 s own positing of itself is thus its own pure activity. The self posits itself, and by virtue of this mere self-assertion it exists; and conversely, the self exists and posits its own existence by virtue of merely existing. It is at once the agent and the product of action; the active, and what the activity brings about; action and deed are one and the same. ” (97) * This relationship of our self-awareness to time and to the systems constructed to examine time within time is what fascinates me. I am trying to construct pieces and places that encourage contemplative meditation on that relationship. As a constructed and immersive environment, these <b>video</b> <b>loops</b> are combined and contrasted to add one more layer, one more circle manifest in the physical space of the gallery, to the constructed system. This series of loops and circuits continues when the viewer plugs into the environment and becomes one more dimension of the piece, namely the dimension that defines the piece within the “now”. That definition is locational within time, and the circuit is complete for as long as the viewer’s attention persists. Time is the breath of video. Meditation is an awareness of breath. Breathe… keep breathing. Adviser: Aaron Holz * Fichte, Johann. The Science of Knowledge, trans. Peter Heath and John Lachs (Cambridge: Cambridge, 1982) ...|$|R
