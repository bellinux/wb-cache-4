60|$|Madame de Quinet's {{analytic}} powers {{did not go}} very far; {{and would}} probably have decided against the syrup {{if it had been}} nothing but <b>virgin</b> <b>honey.</b> She was one who fully believed that her dear Queen Jeanne had been poisoned with a pair of gloves, and she had unlimited faith in the powers of evil possessed by Rene of Milan. Of course, she detected the presence of a slow poison, whose effects would have been attributed to the ailment it was meant to cure; and though her evidence was insufficient, she probably did Ercole no injustice. She declined testing the compound on any unfortunate dog or cat, but sealed it up in the presence of Gardon, Eutacie, and Mademoiselle Perrot, to be produced against the pedlar if ever he should be caught.|$|E
60|$|He {{had less}} {{interest}} {{now in the}} chemists' shops, with their great glowing bottles (with smaller repositories of brightness in their very stoppers); and in their agreeable compromises between medicine and perfumery, {{in the shape of}} toothsome lozenges and <b>virgin</b> <b>honey.</b> Neither had he the least regard (but he never had much) for the tailors', where the newest metropolitan waistcoat patterns were hanging up, which by some strange transformation always looked amazing there, and never appeared at all like the same thing anywhere else. But he stopped to read the playbill at the theatre and surveyed the doorway with a kind of awe, which was not diminished when a sallow gentleman with long dark hair came out, and told a boy to run home to his lodgings and bring down his broadsword. Mr Pinch stood rooted to the spot on hearing this, and might have stood there until dark, but that the old cathedral bell began to ring for vesper service, on which he tore himself away.|$|E

40|$|International audienceInstrumental {{insemination}} is {{an attractive}} alternative to natural mating because specific genetic crosses can be made, thus producing colonies with desired traits. However, there are conflicting reports on the quality and acceptance of instrumentally inseminated (II) queens compared to naturally mated (NM) queens. One factor that affects acceptance and retention of queens is the volatile compounds they produce. Our study compared volatile chemicals from <b>virgin</b> and mated <b>honey</b> bee queens that were either NM or II. The volatile compounds from virgin queens differed from those of mated egg-laying queens. Virgin queens produced greater relative amounts of the volatile compounds we detected (including 2 -phenylethanol, n-octanal, and n-decanal) {{with the exception of}} E-β-ocimene, which was higher in mated laying queens. II and NM queens did not differ in type or relative amounts of volatile compounds. The similarities between II and NM queens indicate that the physiological changes that happen after mating and egg laying occur regardless of the mating method...|$|R
40|$|The Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella Zeller, is {{a serious}} {{cosmopolitan}} pest for cereal mills and wherever flour is stored, and in the Azores {{it is used to}} rear parasites and predators that are used in biological control (Trichogrammatidae, Coccinellídae, Chrysopidae). In order to leam the effect of mass rearing conditions on the reproduction of E. kuehniella, four groups of adult moths were studied: (i) isolated couples which were allowed to mate freely during all adult life, and which were not fed; (ii) isolated couples which mated freely and were fed with honey; (iii) couples that mated once and were not fed; (iv) virgins and were not fed. Differences between groups regarding weight, longevity, copulating behaviour, fecundity, fertility and number of spermatophores were evaluated. Females were heavier than males. Males and virgin females lived significantly longer than mated females. The oviposition was mainly concentrated in the first three days of the females lifetime (70 - 90 % laying eggs). A high percentage (88 %) of copulations occured within five hours before dawn. No significant differences were found in fecundiry and fertiliry parameters between females coupling once and those mating freely during lifetime, nor between those fed with or without <b>honey.</b> <b>Virgin</b> females laid lower numbers of eggs than mated females...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to uncover genes {{associated}} with ovary activation in honey bee workers, {{the extent to which}} eight candidate genes co-varied in their expression with experimentally-induced changes in worker reproductive state was examined. Groups of caged, queenless workers narcotized with CO 2 on consecutive days early in adult life showed a significantly lower level of ovary activation than did groups of untreated workers. This same experimental treatment, by contrast, is known to accelerate ovary activation and induce egg laying in <b>virgin</b> <b>honey</b> bee queens – an observation that suggests that CO 2 narcosis has contrasting effects in queen versus worker ovary activation. Experimentally-induced changes to worker reproductive state were associated with changes in gene expression. Vitellogenin, an egg yolk precursor, and transferrin, an iron transporter, were two transcripts found to be significantly down-regulated {{as a function of the}} ovary-inhibiting treatment. CO 2 narcosis did not effect the expression of six other genes selected as putative markers for processes that may underlie ovary activation. The show that the expression of vitellogenin and transferrin is correlated with ovary activation in workers, and may therefore be part of the gene network involved in the regulatory control of functional sterility in honeybees...|$|E
40|$|In beekeeping, queen {{honey bees}} are often {{temporarily}} kept alive in cages. We determined {{the survival of}} newly-emerged <b>virgin</b> <b>honey</b> bee queens every day for seven days in an experiment that simultaneously investigated three factors: queen cage type (wooden three-hole or plastic), attendant workers (present or absent) and food type (sugar candy, honey, or both). Ten queens were tested {{in each of the}} 12 combinations. Queens were reared using standard beekeeping methods (Doolittle/grafting) and emerged from their cells into vials held in an incubator at 34 C. All 12 combinations gave high survival (90 or 100 %) for three days but only one method (wooden cage, with attendants, honey) gave 100 % survival to day seven. Factors affecting queen survival were analysed. Across all combinations, attendant bees significantly increased survival (18 % vs. 53 %, p< 0. 001). In addition, there was an interaction between food type and cage type (p< 0. 001) with the honey and plastic cage combination giving reduced survival. An additional group of queens was reared and held for seven days using the best method, and then directly introduced using smoke into queenless nucleus colonies that had been dequeened five days previously. Acceptance was high (80 %, 8 / 10) showing that this combination is also suitable for preparing queens for introduction into colonies. Having a simple method for keeping newly-emerged virgin queens alive in cages for one week and acceptable for introduction into queenless colonies will be useful in honey bee breeding. In particular, it facilitates the screening of many queens for genetic or phenotypic characteristics when only a small proportion meets the desired criteria. These can then be introduced into queenless hives for natural mating or insemination, both of which take place when queens are one week old...|$|E
