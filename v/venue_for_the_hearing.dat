5000|$|Novartis {{mounted a}} {{separate}} and concurrent litigation before the Madras High Court arguing that section 3(d) of the Indian Patents Act is violated Article 14 of the Indian constitution because {{the definition of}} [...] "enhanced efficacy" [...] was too vague and left too much {{power in the hands}} of the patent examiner, and was in violation of India's obligations under the TRIPs agreement because it rendered inventions that should be patentable, unpatentable, and argued that the Court was <b>the</b> proper <b>venue</b> <b>for</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> claim concerning violation of TRIPS. Counsel <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Indian government argued that any violation of TRIPS belonged before the Dispute Settlement Board established by TRIPS, not before the Court, and that in any case, TRIPS allowed national laws to address the needs of its citizens; with respect to the claim that the amended law was arbitrary, counsel argued that [...] "enhanced efficacy" [...] is well understood in the pharmaceutical arts. In 2007 the High Court decided, agreeing with Novartis that it had <b>the</b> right to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> case, and agreeing with counsel <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Indian government that the law was not vague, and that the law complied with TRIPS, and observed that section 3(d) aims to prevent evergreening and to provide easy access for Indian citizens to life saving drugs. Novartis did not further challenge this order.|$|R
