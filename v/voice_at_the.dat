5|$|Paul Oscar rediscovered his <b>voice</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 18, singing bass {{with the}} Hamrahlíð college choir for two years. In 1990 {{he won a}} talent contest for his college; later that year {{at the time of}} his graduation, he played Frank-N-Furter to great success in the college's {{production}} of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Around the same time, he began appearing in drag shows at a notorious Reykjavík nightclub. After the club closed, he became a radio jockey on independent radio station FM 90,9. He also appeared in a film, Svo á jörðu sem á himni (As in Heaven, 1992).|$|E

Finally, Rick Pearl did the additional programming and Gene Grimaldi did the audio mastering at Oasis Mastering Studios in Burbank, California.|$|E

25|$|The abolishment of the Catholic {{section of}} the Prussian Ministry of ecclesiastical and {{educational}} affairs, deprived Catholics of their <b>voice</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> highest level. The system of strict government supervision of schools was applied only in Catholic areas; the Protestant schools were left alone. The school politics also alienated Protestant conservatives and churchmen.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the canon law experts brought to Rome {{to serve on the}} codification commission, all the Latin Church's bishops and superiors general of religious orders were periodically consulted via letter.

25|$|After the war, Doohan {{moved to}} London, Ontario for further {{technical}} education. After hearing a radio drama {{that he knew}} he could do better, he recorded his <b>voice</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> local radio station, and learned about a drama school in Toronto.

25|$|McKay {{was born}} in London to an English father, writer-director Malcolm McKay, and an American mother, actress Robin Pappas. She holds dual citizenship. While growing up, she lived with her mother in Harlem, New York, in Olympia, Washington and in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. She studied jazz <b>voice</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan School of Music, but did not graduate. Her {{performances}} at various New York City music venues, including the Sidewalk Cafe and Joe's Pub, drew attention from record labels. She signed with Columbia Records.|$|E
25|$|Because of his asthma, Nabors {{moved to}} Los Angeles {{and worked as}} a film cutter for NBC. He also worked at a Santa Monica tavern, The Horn, singing and acting in cabaret theater. His act {{featured}} him as a character similar to the Gomer Pyle character he later portrayed. He sang in a baritone and sometimes spoke and sang in his higher-pitched comedic <b>voice.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> club, comedian Bill Dana saw Nabors' act and invited him to appear on The Steve Allen Show. Nabors signed on to the show, but it was soon canceled.|$|E
25|$|Painlevé was {{a leading}} <b>voice</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Rapallo conference {{that led to the}} {{establishment}} of the Supreme Allied Council, a consultative body of Allied powers that anticipated the unified Allied command finally established in the following year. He appointed Ferdinand Foch as French representative knowing that he was the natural Allied commander. On Painlevé's return to Paris he was defeated and resigned on 13 November 1917 to be succeeded by Georges Clemenceau. Foch was finally made commander-in-chief of all Allied armies on the Western and Italian fronts in March 1918.|$|E

25|$|Orlando de Lassus {{was born}} in Mons in the County of Hainaut, Habsburg Netherlands (modern-day Belgium). Information about his early years is scanty, {{although}} some uncorroborated stories have survived, {{the most famous of}} which is that he was kidnapped three times because of the singular beauty of his singing <b>voice.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> age of twelve, he left the Low Countries with Ferrante Gonzaga and went to Mantua, Sicily, and later Milan (from 1547 to 1549). While in Milan, he made the acquaintance of the madrigalist Spirito l'Hoste da Reggio, a formative influence on his early musical style.|$|E
25|$|During 1986 {{the series}} became {{dominated}} by Den and Angie's storylines {{and the focus}} of the programme was very much concentrated on their combustible relationship. The emphasis began early in 1986 with the arrival of Den's mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How). Jan had been a powerful off-screen presence for the first year, a menacing <b>voice</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the telephone, which severely affected the mood of both Den and Angie and kept the audience on edge every time the phone rang. Jan's physical arrival at the Vic in January 1986 was one of the show's dramatic highlights. Her invasion of Angie's territory was a springboard to future emotional fireworks and a precursor to Angie's further dependence on alcohol and her attempted suicide.|$|E
500|$|Robert Christgau thought {{highly of}} the album, however, writing in The Village <b>Voice</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time: [...] "The {{music is not}} only simple and attractive, with the {{synthesizer}} used mostly for texture and the guitar breaks for comment, but it actually achieves some of the symphonic dignity (and cross-referencing) that The Dark Side of the Moon simulated so ponderously." [...] He later wrote: [...] "My favorite Pink Floyd album has always been Wish You Were Here, and you know why? It has soul, that's why – it's Roger Waters's lament for Syd, not my idea of a tragic hero {{but as long as}} he's Roger's that doesn't matter." ...|$|E

500|$|Douglas was {{not well}} {{received}} by some audiences. She opposed the drainage of a suburb in Dade County named East Everglades. After the county approved building permits in the Everglades, the land flooded as it had for centuries. When homeowners demanded the Army Corps of Engineers drain their neighborhoods, {{she was the only}} opposing <b>voice.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> hearing in 1983, she was booed, jeered, and shouted at by the audience of residents. [...] "Can't you boo any louder than that?" [...] she chided, eventually making them laugh. [...] "Look. I'm an old lady. I've been here since eight o'clock. It's now eleven. I've got all night, and I'm used to the heat," [...] she told them. Later, she wrote, [...] "They're all good souls—they just shouldn't be out there." [...] Dade County commissioners eventually decided not to drain.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{arrived at}} Hull House {{in the autumn}} of 1890 and shortly after her first visit began to give voice and piano lessons to both {{children}} and adults. Initially free concerts were given on Sunday, both as a means to uplift the community and to highlight the talents of the settlement house teachers and musicians. Between November 1891 and April 1892, there were 22 Sunday concerts held at Hull House before the music school was officially founded. Smith was {{one of the founders of}} Hull House Music School the following year, which became the first settlement music school in the United States. She invited one of her friends from Germany, Amalie Hannig, who had been teaching piano at the Klindworth Conservatory to help her with the school. [...] Hannig taught both piano and <b>voice</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> school until 1898. Mary Rozet Smith, one of the benefactors of Hull House provided the funding to establish the school.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Andy Kellman picked [...] "I Luv This Shit" [...] {{as one of}} {{the best}} tracks from both Downtown and Testimony. Gregory Adams of Exclaim! praised Alsina's [...] "velvety" [...] vocal {{delivery}} on the song. Brandon Soderberg from Spin called it [...] "one of the more mazy and rewarding radio R songs in quite some time", but was unimpressed with the Songz and Brown remix's shift from partying to sexual intercourse, particularly the rewriting of the hook as [...] "She loves this shit" [...] or [...] "You love this shit". A panel of writers for Complex placed [...] "I Luv This Shit" [...] at number thirty-three on its list of the 50 Best Songs of 2013; Claire Lobenfeld disapproved of James' verse but lauded the [...] "quivering beauty" [...] of Alsina's <b>voice.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> 2014 BET Awards, [...] "I Luv This Shit" [...] won the award for Viewer's Choice and was nominated for the award of Best Collaboration, losing to [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] by Beyoncé and Jay-Z.|$|E

500|$|Albini {{sought to}} produce a record that sounded nothing like Nevermind. [...] He felt the sound of Nevermind was [...] "sort of a {{standard}} hack recording that {{has been turned into}} a very, very controlled, compressed radio-friendly mix [...] That is not, in my opinion, very flattering to a rock band." [...] Instead, the intention was to capture a more natural and visceral sound. [...] Albini refused to double-track Cobain's vocals and instead recorded him singing alone in a resonant room. [...] The producer noted the intensity of the singer's vocals on some tracks; he said, [...] "There's a really dry, really loud <b>voice</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of 'Milk It'... that was also done at the end of 'Rape Me', where [...] wanted the sound of him screaming to just overtake the whole band." [...] Albini achieved the album's sparse drum sound by simply placing several microphones around the room while Dave Grohl performed, picking up the natural reverberation of the room. [...] Albini explained, [...] "If you take a good drummer and put him in front of a drum kit that sounds good acoustically and just record it, you've done your job." ...|$|E
500|$|Nixon's {{approach}} ultimately {{impressed the}} studio and her recording was kept, which took the singer only thirty-two minutes to complete. However, she approached it {{as though she was}} performing the entire score. Although Nixon performs only one verse in the song, her musical contribution to [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] marked the singer's return to film roles following her lengthy hiatus. Mulan was also Nixon's first Disney film in 10 years; she had previously performed in the musical film Mary Poppins (1964). Nixon was eventually joined by Broadway performers Beth Fowler and Lea Salonga, although the three singers never recorded together. The studio enjoyed Nixon's performance so much that they ultimately decided to recast the actress who had been providing Grandmother Fa's speaking <b>voice</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time with someone who sounded more like her, replacing her with voice actress June Foray. Disney had been considered hiring actresses Lauren Bacall and June Havoc to record [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] prior to Nixon's. The songwriters first based [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] on a rough cut they had seen of the scene; the animators eventually synced the animated characters with the singers' voices.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} Bono and The Edge's {{acoustic}} [...] "Original of the Species" [...] (2004). Turlington {{said of the}} track, [...] "Bono wrote the song with his daughters in mind. It's wishful and imparts the idea that, 'I'm here and I'm watching you take your steps forward and I'm supporting your independence, {{but at the same}} time, I don't want you to make mistakes.' Any parent can relate to that." [...] The song is followed by Eddie Vedder's acoustic ballad [...] "Skipping", which he wrote as a tribute to his children and features his daughter Olivia's (age 6) <b>voice</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the track, saying [...] "check, check" [...] and [...] "daddy, daddy". Turlington said of Vedder's involvement: Eddie was amazing to accept this project while in the midst of so much. I spoke to him and exchanged several emails about his contribution. [...] "Skipping" [...] is such a sweet song and I just love that his daughter Olivia has a little cameo at the start. He once wrote me saying that his girls would be proud one day that their dad contributed to such a meaningful project.|$|E
