The benchmarks are: rethinking the concept of the <b>consumer</b> (the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumer</b> and the consumer/customer), focussing beyond traditional consumer law on internet sales and on consumer services (telecom, energy, transport, financial services), integrating and developing a consistent approach to consumer law enforcement via individual and collective action, via ADR, courts and administrative bodies.

40|$|Although {{consumer}} protection {{is not a}} new concept in South African law, the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 (CPA) now provides for a much more comprehensive and encompassing mechanism to protect consumers. This is primarily done in three ways: a) Protecting consumers not only in the provision of goods and services, the conclusion of contracts but also in the promotion and marketing thereof; b) Providing from the outset of the CPA (starting with the preamble to the Act) special protection to a particular type of consumer which is the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumer.</b> In terms of section 3 of the CPA the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumer</b> includes low-income, illiterate, young and elderly consumers.

50|$|Children are {{arguably the}} most <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> {{affected}} by directed advertising. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the average child sees more than 20,000 commercials {{a year in the}} United States. While this number is not significantly different from the number of commercials that adults are exposed to, children are affected more negatively than adults are. Unlike adults, children cannot be expected to have the proper rational abilities to operate in their own self interests without being unfairly taken advantage of by advertisements. Research done by the American Psychological Association shows that {{children under the age of}} 8 are mentally incapable of viewing and interpreting television advertisements with a critical eye. According to the APA, children are more prone to accepting advertisements as truthful, accurate, and unbiased than adults are. Adults are able to recognize that the purpose of advertising is to persuade. Children under the age of 6 have difficulties separating commercials from regular television programming. Thus, these children are more susceptible to being hoodwinked by commercials into craving junk food, having low self-esteem, and developing bad habits.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{criticism}} among mainstream consumers {{has been}} that risk-based pricing can make 'shopping' for the best interest rates much more difficult. It {{is almost impossible to}} tell at first glance if one can be qualified to get an advertised rate or exactly what interest rate they qualify for at all. Consumer-rights advocates also believe that risk-based pricing in the extreme, especially in the form of predatory lending, hurts financially disadvantaged and <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> by cutting them off from reasonably affordable capital and exposing them unwittingly to soaring interest rates and unsustainable financing schemes that erode equity and may lead to default. Risk-based pricing can be manipulated to wield deceptive marketing practices, such as the bait and switch. The fairness of similar lending practices within the mortgage industry is being investigated by the United States Congress. [...] Some supporters of risk based pricing have suggested that it should be accompanied by heightened disclosure and transparency requirements and standardization of loan terms to facilitate comparison shopping and ameliorate these problems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purchase}} of a product or service by a consumer directly abroad and the remote consumption of goods are the two main ways in which transnational consumption occurs. This new contractual dynamic – {{a direct result of}} the development of transport and communication facilities- has consequences not only for consumer protection but also for trade law. It demands from doctrine, courts and legislators an effort to solve problems arising therefrom. Important lessons can be learned from the application of economic theory to law among the difficulties to fit private international law to constitutional principles. New paradigms proposed by the courts in recent years brought great expectations in the national legal system to the evolution of consumer protection concerning international trade. Theoretical developments are now necessary to elaborate regulatory proposals under trademark and corporate law- with particular attention to financial institutions-so as to grant greater protection to the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumer</b> assuring security and predictability to the system, which are essential to the correct operation of the market...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in consumers' reliance on credit and rising consumer debt. The increase is especially problematic for those least able to afford debt of any kind - welfare recipients. This qualitative study reports on 120 Australian welfare recipients' attitudes towards debt, their understanding about what constitutes acceptable debt and the debt-management strategies they adopt. The results of this research show that welfare recipients see debt {{as a way of life}} and as a means of survival in a society where a core value appears (to them) to be the acquisition of material wealth. Their status as income earners and therefore their capacity to service debt is less than others. Consequently, we could expect that their debt levels would be proportionally less; however, many participants in this research did not appear to understand the long term consequences of their level of debt. The paper concludes with a discussion as to how social marketing can be applied to potentially assist this <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumer</b> group and the wider community...|$|R
5000|$|Utility {{companies}} {{propose that}} from a consumer perspective, smart metering offers potential benefits to householders. These include, a) an end to estimated bills, which are {{a major source of}} complaints for many customers b) a tool to help consumers better manage their energy purchases - stating that smart meters with a display outside their homes could provide up-to-date information on gas and electricity consumption and in doing so help people to manage their energy use and reduce their energy bills. Electricity pricing usually peaks at certain predictable times of the day and the season. In particular, if generation is constrained, prices can rise if power from other jurisdictions or more costly generation is brought online. Proponents assert that billing customers at a higher rate for peak times will encourage consumers to adjust their consumption habits to be more responsive to market prices and assert further, that regulatory and market design agencies hope these [...] "price signals" [...] could delay the construction of additional generation or at least the purchase of energy from higher priced sources, thereby controlling the steady and rapid increase of electricity prices. There are some concerns, however, that low income and <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> may not benefit from intraday time-of-use tariffs.|$|E

Realizing {{differences in the}} consumption behaviors of economically better-off and impoverished consumers, some researchers explored how poor consumers cope with economic restrictions {{in a world of}} abundance. Lewis (1970), for example, argued that poor consumers did not behave according to the dictates of higher-income people, while others claimed that consumption values were the same regardless of consumer’s level of income (e. g. Irelan and Besner 1966; Leeds 1971). On the one hand, poor consumers were seen as lacking the adequate level of income to provide themselves with proper consumption (e. g. Holloway and Cardozo 1969); on the other hand, they were perceived to be capable of find-ing their own ways to optimize their purchases in terms of assortments of products (e. g. An-dreasen 1975). Overall, the expectation is that “necessities of survival” have to be met first; thus, most studies focus on understanding what constitutes the “basic needs” of the poor con-sumers (e. g.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{the impact}} of section 22 of the Consumer Protection Act, 68 of 2008 on the {{drafting}} of contracts in South Africa is investigated. It was shown {{that there has been}} a great shift internationally to the drafting of consumer documents in plain language. Some jurisdictions even have statutory guidelines for drafting in plain language. The benefits of drafting in plain language were also mentioned. The South African plain language drafting situation is quite unique, with the question of what the characteristics of an ordinary consumer are, posing to be the most important question in determining specific plain language guidelines for South African consumers. It was found that there are potentially more than one type of ordinary consumer, depending on the type of commercial transaction being entered into. Although no statutory plain language drafting guidelines have been published in South Africa, it was suggested that our common law rules of interpretation are a valuable starting point when looking for guidelines for better drafting. This dissertation concludes that two sets of guidelines be developed for at least two levels of commercial transactions. Firstly, the international guidelines of Kimble should be incorporated into our law for consumer contracts relating to more complex consumer transactions. Secondly, another set of guidelines relating to the use of illustrations, examples, headings or other aids to reading and understanding, as envisioned by the CPA, should be developed for use in everyday consumer contracts where the typical consumer is illiterate or falls into the so called <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumer</b> category.
