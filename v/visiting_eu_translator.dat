40|$|Within the European institutions, {{language}} – {{the so-called}} Eurojargon – {{is characterized by}} specific traits that are thought to facilitate communication between all member states and reflect the unique reality of the EU. The supranational nature of this language makes it {{a good candidate for}} making intercultural identity possible in a context where geographical, historical, and cultural differences are generally subsumed under a common European identity. Eurojargon is first elaborated by the instutions internally and then ‘exported’ to the member states and their citizens. The underlying assumption is therefore that people within the institutions are familiar with this language. <b>EU</b> <b>translators</b> play the role of mediators, transferring EU terms and expressions from one “national” Eurojargon to another. But is this special language always intelligible to them? By looking at data collected from a specific translation aid tool used on a daily basis by <b>EU</b> <b>translators,</b> I seek to establish to what extent EU-related expressions are problematic for translation and the kind and nature of these translation problems...|$|R

40|$|Most of the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) is {{considered}} a region of very low hepatitis A virus (HAV) endemicity; however, geographical differences exist. We did a systematic review {{with the aim of}} describing seroprevalence and susceptibility in the general population or special groups in the EU and EEA. We searched databases and public health national institutes websites for HAV seroprevalence records published between Jan 1, 1975, and June 30, 2014, with no language restrictions. An updated search was done on Aug 10, 2016. We defined seroprevalence profiles (very low, low, and intermediate) as the proportion of the population with age-specific anti-HAV antibodies at age 15 and 30 years, and susceptibility profiles (low, moderate, high, and very high) as the proportion of susceptible individuals at age 30 and 50 years. We included 228 studies from 28 of 31 EU and EEA countries. For the period 2000 - 14, 24 countries had a very low seroprevalence profile, compared with five in 1975 - 89. The susceptibility among adults ranged between low and very high and had a geographical gradient, with three countries in the low susceptibility category. Since 1975, EU and EEA countries have shown decreasing seropositivity; however, considerable regional variability exists. The main limitations of this study are that the studies retrieved for analysis might not be representative of all EU and EEA publications about HAV and might have poor national representativeness. A large proportion of EU and EEA residents are now susceptible to HAV infection. Our Review supports the need to reconsider specific prevention and control measures, to further decrease HAV circulation while providing protection against the infection in the EU and EEA, and could be used to inform susceptible travellers <b>visiting</b> <b>EU</b> and EEA countries with different HAV endemicity levels...|$|R
50|$|Directive 2009/16/EC {{reformed}} the EU's Port State Control scheme. All ships {{calling on}} EU ports must be inspected, {{even if they}} only rarely <b>visit</b> the <b>EU.</b> A risk profile is established for each ship, based on its type, age, flag, company history, and detainment history. Depending on the risk profile, ships may be inspected as often as every six months, or as infrequently as every three years. Substandard ships are subject to a mandatory minimum ban period, and repeat offenders may be permanently banned. This provision was controversial, with some member states of the EU arguing that the costs would be too great. All five Maltese ministers of the European Parliament voted against the measures; the Erika, the vessel whose oil spill spurred the creation of these laws, was a Maltese-flagged vessel.|$|R
50|$|When {{goods or}} {{services}} are sold (and sent) to a private person across a border within the area, the buyer usually pays the sales country's VAT to the seller, and does not pay any VAT in the buyer's country. But if the seller's annual sales of goods to the buyer's country exceed a threshold (which varies by country), the seller must instead charge VAT in the buyer's country. These are known as the distance selling rules. When a private person <b>visits</b> another <b>EU</b> country and buys goods, the seller {{does not have to}} take special action, just claim the local VAT, and the buyer can bring it home for personal use or gifts without limits.The 2015 EU VAT legislation requires two non-conflicting pieces of evidence to be produced so as to determine what VAT rate should be applied to these digital goods sales.|$|R

40|$|The twenty-seven Member States that {{constitute}} the European Union differ on linguistic, cultural and legal grounds. Nevertheless, one of the EU’s founding principles is multilingualism and the translation of its entire legislation in all the twenty-three official languages. Originally conceived for a four-member community, multilingualism has resisted throughout the numerous waves of EU enlargement and is today aimed at giving national Governments {{the chance to be}} equally represented. In particular, unlike other international organizations, the European Union enacts legislative measures that override national law; multilingualism is therefore also indispensable to guarantee that citizens in each Member State thoroughly understand the law in their native language in order to comply with it. Following an introductory section on multilingual legal drafting and on the difficulties related to the uniform interpretation of EU specialised concepts throughout national courts, the study concentrates on the semantic and morphosyntactic aspects that help classify EU language as a Language for Special Purposes (LSP). From a lexical perspective, the focus shifts to a diachronic analysis of the neologisms derived from Community debates, policy and legislation. Reflecting the continuous evolution of its political, economic and legislative measures, ‘Eurolanguage’ becomes a highly productive mechanism that increasingly permeates national languages through politics and the media. Terminological productivity is also constantly guaranteed by the meticulous work of <b>EU</b> staff <b>translators,</b> who exploit the inner resources of national languages and thus actively contribute to the introduction and diffusion of EU specialised terminology...|$|R
