Cultivou-se o feijoeiro comum (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) submetido a quatro níveis de déficit hídrico (psi) (15; 30; 45 e 60 kPa) e três métodos de manejo da irrigação (M), sendo dois automatizados, utilizando tensiômetros com vacuômetro de mercúrio (Hg) e tensiômetros com vacuômetro de Bourdon (Vc), ambos adaptados, e o terceiro manejo, convencional, utilizando tensímetro portátil de leitura digital (Ts). Foi avaliado o funcionamento do controlador, a partir do volume de água aplicado e número de acionamentos, a produtividade de grãos e a eficiência de uso da água. Observou-se que tanto o rendimento quanto a eficiência de uso da água não foram afetados pelos métodos de {{manejo de}} irrigação. A variável volume de água aplicado foi afetada tanto pelo método (M) quanto pelas tensões (psi) e pela interação (M x psi).

40|$|Proper planter {{adjustment}} and operation {{play an important}} role in uniform stand establishment for corn. A two−year study was conducted to assess the impact of planter speed and a seed−firming device on corn stand establishment and grain yield. A planter equipped with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>metering</b> system and commercial seed firming devices was used in this study. Corn was seeded in a randomized complete block experiment at three speeds at two locations in Kansas (USA). Plant stand was counted at regular intervals after the first plant emerged to determine emergence rate. Plant spacing within each treatment was measured after complete emergence. Mean plant spacing, standard deviation in spacing, and four spacing indices (miss, multiple, quality of feed, and precision) were calculated to evaluate the plant spacing data. The miss and multiple indices indicate the number of skips and doubles. Planter performance as measured by these indices and standard deviation in plant spacing decreased as planter speed increased. The seed firmer reduced plant spacing standard deviations at a rate equivalent to the standard deviation increase observed when planter speed increased approximately 1. 6 km/h (1 mph). Corn yield was reduced as planter speed increased at one location, but not the others. This response was the result of lower plant densities at the higher planter speeds, suggesting that one of the goals of the planting process should be to establish adequate plant densities.

The results were not significantly affected by the working position of the seed meter nor by speeds between 1. 0 and 3. 0 m/s for the seed meter and planter prototype. Field tests were conducted at several residue covers at 2. 0 m/s and no significant differences in plant spacings were observed. The prototype was modified to be able to plant different population rates. Seed spacings of 136, 165 and 210 mm were obtained by constructing three punch wheels with different punch lengths. Laboratory and field tests were run at speeds of 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 m/s. The field tests were run in three different residue covers (corn, grain sorghum and soybean). Despite problems with synchronization between the seed meter and punch wheels in some combinations, the length of the punches seemed to cause no significant problems at the speeds tested. A soil cleaning device was designed to reduce the soil disturbance. The volume of soil displaced by the smallest punch wheel was less than half of that displaced by a commercial no-till planter.
