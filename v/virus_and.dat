5|$|Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an RNA virus of {{the family}} Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus.

Most are transmitted by arthropods (mosquitoes or ticks), and are therefore also referred to as arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses).|$|E

5|$|Playa de Oro {{virus was}} {{identified}} as a new species in 2008 and is most closely related to Bayou virus, Catacamas virus, Muleshoe <b>virus,</b> <b>and</b> Black Creek Canal virus, found in other species of Oryzomys and Sigmodon. Catacamas virus is found in a different population of Oryzomys couesi, and the presence of different viruses in these two species has been used as an argument for classifying the two populations of the host as separate species.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{analogy between}} {{computer}} <b>viruses</b> <b>and</b> biological <b>viruses,</b> from which computer viruses get their name, has been clear {{for the past}} several decades.

40|$|<b>Viruses</b> <b>and</b> prokaryotes {{represent}} the smallest {{and the most}} abundant biological entities in marine environments. The interest for <b>viruses</b> <b>and</b> their interactions with marine organisms is continuously rising but the studies are generally limited to short-time investigations. This study conducted in the Gulf of Trieste on monthly resolution investigates {{for the very first}} time relationships between <b>viruses</b> <b>and</b> prokaryotes (both heterotrophs-HP and autotrophs-AP) over ten years (2000 e 2010). From our results emerged that no clear relationship between the abundances of <b>viruses</b> <b>and</b> prokaryotes is observed unless for rather restricted time intervals. Some of the sporadic peaks of viral abundances can be attributable to infections occurred during the autumn phytoplankton blooms, thus probably contributing to the end of the bloom. We infer that the general uncoupling between <b>viruses</b> <b>and</b> prokaryotes in the Gulf of Trieste is due to the variety of factors that regulate viral infection, proliferation and persistence such as the diversity of viral life cycles that are determined by environmental factors, the abundance and the physiological status of their hosts...|$|R
5|$|Prior to the {{identification}} of HIV {{as the cause of}} AIDS in 1984, Sonnabend's investigations led him to propose that AIDS among gay men might be caused by multiple factors including Epstein–Barr <b>virus</b> <b>and</b> repeated exposure to cytomegalovirus and semen. This suggestion conflicted with the prevailing view that a single agent was likely responsible.|$|E
5|$|Several diseases, like Rat Coronavirus Infection (RCI), Sendai <b>virus,</b> <b>and</b> Murine Respiratory Mycoplasmosis (MRM, Mycoplasma pulmonis), are {{prevalent}} {{simply because}} their highly contagious natures work {{in tandem with}} the way rats are kept in laboratories, pet stores, and by breeders. It should be noted, however, that MRM is far less likely to occur in laboratory rats than in those kept as pets.|$|E
