Therefore, visitors with or without visual disabilities can acquire information via the same exhibition panel.

In the Criminal Code, common decency settings and types of crimes, including crimes of rape (Article 285), criminal acts of intercourse (Article 287), and the crime of obscene acts (Article 289). Special criminal lewd acts against children in national legislation regulated in Law Number 23 Year 2002 on Child Protection (Article 82). This Act, intended to provide protection to children as victims of crime decency, and therefore the threat of organized crime in it using criminal anacaman cumulative. In {{the practice of law}} enforcement, especially in court decisions, criminal defendants are sometimes dropped to less provide a sense of justice.

BJN. <b>visible</b> <b>panel</b> of judges who investigate and adjudicate cases paying less attention to the demands of prosecutors who prosecute criminal jailed for 4 (four) years to the defendant, who in the court examination otherwise proven legally and convincingly guilty of violating Article 82 of Law No. 23 of 2002. In its decision the judges impose imprisonment for 3 (three) years to the defendant. Although the decision was justified under Article 82 of Law No. 23 of 2002, for a minimum of 3 years and a maximum of 15 years, but the judge should also consider and pay attention to the facts in the court examination that has been proven legally and convincingly, and the things that incriminating defendant, the absence of the defendant's reasons for forgiving. Problem of the imposition of criminal or application for the perpetrators of criminal offenses are closely linked to criminal liability. Therefore in a prison sentence for 3 years to the defendant should be considered a key element in criminal responsibility, namely the principle of legality and error. In addition, also need to consider what is described in the claims. Key words: obscene acts, the defendant, {{children under the age of}} criminal responsibility, the verdict...|$|E

In the 0. 9 to 2. 5 micro-m the panel recommended support for the investigation of monolithic arrays.

50|$|The {{process of}} making raised panel doors begins with gluing up panels, and then moves into cutting and {{preparing}} the frame parts. Next, the panels are cut to size and shaped.

The joints are glued and set into clamps. If the frame and panel items are paint grade they are sometimes nailed at the frame joints on the reverse side.

50|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, {{the sales of}} the Lincoln Continental had held steady and the Continental Mark V {{would go on to}} outsell its Cadillac Eldorado counterpart. In the {{development}} of the Lincoln Town Car, the design themes of the 1977-1979 Lincoln Continental and Mark V would both influence the exterior design of the 1980 Continental/Town Car. As with its predecessors, the Town Car features nearly flat body sides, sharp-edged fenders, and a radiator-style grille. In a major departure, hideaway headlamps gave way to exposed halogen headlamps (the first on a full-size Lincoln since 1969). Another first included fully framed door glass (retractable vent windows were now standard); in sharp contrast to its Ford and Mercury counterparts, the window frames were painted matte black. While chrome trim remained around the headlamps and window frames, in a break from Lincoln tradition, it was deleted {{from the top of the}} fenders. Though mechanically similar to the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis (the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis after 1983), the Lincoln Town Car shared <b>visible</b> body <b>panels</b> only with the Continental Mark VI. In contrast to its Ford, Mercury, and Mark VI counterparts, the rooflines of 1981-1989 Town Cars feature a vertical quarter window in the C-pillar.|$|R

40|$|Thousands of {{children}} are injured or killed each year in school bus accidents. A significant number of these tragic incidents is precipitated by disruptive child behavior that distracts the drivers from their difficult task. Two experiments were conducted which addressed this problem. For both experiments an automated sound recording device (referred to as a Noise Guard) selectively responsive to frequencies above 500 Hz (i. e., unresponsive to bus drone) recorded both the duration and frequency of noise outbursts above a tolerable threshold. Additionally, an observer made in situ measurements of other disruptions including roughhousing and getting-out-of-seat. In the first experiment, following baseline measurements of these behaviors, middle-school students received feedback for noise outbursts. That is, when "Noise Guard" was activated, it in turn operated one of several lights on a <b>panel</b> <b>visible</b> to all passengers. Each day students were allowed to listen to high-appeal taped music while riding the bus {{and to participate in}} a raffle for prizes, provided the number of outbursts on the preceding day remained below a specified criterion indicated on the light panel. This intervention resulted in drastic reductions of noise outbursts with a concomitant reduction in other disruptive behaviors. Comparable results were obtained in the second experiment which eliminated the raffle from the intervention...|$|R

Susan is remembered universally as a kind, gentle and fun loving person who is keenly missed. I am sorry for their loss and hope that in some way this report gives voice to Susan’s story. During the course of this review we have kept Susan’s photo <b>visible</b> at <b>panel</b> meetings, and we never forgot that she was a real and loved person. This report has {{considered}} the perspective and testimony of family equally alongside professional records to better understand what happened and to maximise learning, this is in line with Home Office guidance for the conduct of DHRs. The purpose of a Domestic Homicide Review (DHR) is to identify improvements which could be made to community and organisational responses to victims of domestic abuse, and hopefully to try and prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again. I {{would like to}} thank the panel, and those who provided chronologies and Individual Management Reviews (IMRs), for their time, patience and cooperation. I would also like to thank members of Susan’s family for their contribution, and the time they gave to this review. The family have suffered terribly for many years and further suffering must be avoided wherever possible. For this reason the report author has excluded some information which may identify individuals, like specific dates, and detail of certain incidents, and some information the family would like to remain private. Susan and Peter are pseudonyms agreed with the family. It is considered by the Chair that Peter may still pose a risk to certain members of the family and further suffering must be avoided. It is important to remember that this homicide occurred in late 2013, and since this time there have been changes to some agency practices and procedures. Notably, there have been significant developments in the Police and Housing approaches to Domestic Abuse, and this should be considered when reading the chronology of events...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for the usage of {{composite}} sandwich structures in the aircraft industry. Aircraft may suffer damage {{from a variety of}} impact sources such as ground service equipment, runway debris, bird strike, or hail ice. The damage response of hail ice impacts on composite sandwich structures is not well understood and they can often result in core damage without visually detectable surface damage. This seed damage may grow and lead to large-scale failure of the structure through repetitive operational loading, such as ground-air-ground cycles of aircraft (causes core internal pressurization). Therefore, it is necessary to understand the types of damage that can occur as a result of impacts. This study explores the effect of high velocity hail ice impact on damage formation in lightweight composite sandwich panels, particularly at a level that produces barely <b>visible</b> external damage. <b>Panels</b> consisting of two different facesheet thicknesses (1. 19 and 1. 87 mm) were impacted at angles of 25, 40, and 90 degrees at speeds of 25 and 50 m/ s. The tests revealed three different core damage modes. Any level of measurable surface damage was an indicator of the presence of internal core damage, but internal damage could also be present without measurable surface damage. Thus, visual inspection alone was not a reliable method of damage detection. No clear relationship was found between impact energy levels and internal damage state since, for example, both 83 and 20. 5 J tests produced core fracture, while a 16 J test did not produce any core damage. All core damage occurred at a depth of 3 - 5 mm from the impact- side faceshee...|$|R
