40|$|Down {{the highway}} and off the {{interchange}} is the local shopping mall where suburbia celebrates the “consumer republic ” (Cohen 2004). Shopping these days isn’t the same as when mom went downtown to buy [a] dress or hat, but no matter if it’s in an urban business district or at the mega-mall, an invisible crew of window dressers and fashion mavens “pull it all together” … “especially for you”. Shopping malls and other retail environments are complex social spaces, a product of conflicting agendas and meanings. Workers such as window dressers, known as <b>visual</b> <b>merchandisers</b> in the trade, negotiate between these conflicting agendas and levels of discourse to create compelling images and merchandise presentations, even as corporate branding strategies limit creative control and deskill the craft. Fashion has always been about newness and change, a competitive marketplace encourages the adoption of new technologies, retail being no exception. The suburban mall is another permutation on the pattern of displacement of utopian dreams onto the personalized world of consumption.

40|$|Visual Merchandising {{has been}} around since the dawn of civilization, since humans started selling {{merchandise}} to a customer. When a vendor arranged his goods to be more attractive for a customer, or when a farmer put the biggest and ripest apples on top of the basket for consumers to see and touch, that is visual merchandising. In present generation, people do not shop merely to obtain items they need, but also to satisfy their wants. Frequently, shopping does not even involve making a purchase. For consumers, window-shopping has become a popular pastime. <b>Visual</b> <b>merchandisers</b> create "miniature worlds" for merchandise in an effort {{to attract the attention of}} consumers, draw them into the store and keep them coming back in the future. Despite the advanced techniques seen in visual displays, visual merchandising is not a new concept or art. As early as the 18 th century, merchandise was staged in interesting and unique arrangements to attract consumers’. Visual Merchandising and communication helps improve the conversion of visitors to purchasers and increase transaction values by encouraging multiple sales. The main objective of the study is that to analyse the general shopping behaviour of the respondents in shopping malls and to assess and analyse the effectiveness of the visual merchandising efforts of the sellers in terms of notice ability, opinion and attractiveness to visit the store. For this a sample of 250 was collected from the respondents were percentage analysis, Kruskal Wallis and descriptive statistics were used as statistical tools to analyse the data. The conclusion is that female respondents have higher impact towards time of visiting the mall and time spent for shopping in malls so female respondents can be targeted towards selling the products through visual merchandising...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Window {{displays}} are {{an important}} means by which retailers communicate with both current and potential consumers. The present study investigated how the use of context setting (with or without) in a window display and background music (with or without) influence consumers' mental imagery, arousal response, attitude toward the display, and approach-avoidance behaviors. Furthermore, consumer involvement was investigated as a moderator {{in the relationship between}} context setting of a window display and mental imagery. A two by two factorial between-subjects experimental design with two independent variables, four dependent variables and one moderator was conducted. The independent variables in this study were the window display (with or without a context setting) and background music (with or without background music). Mental imagery, arousal response, the attitude toward the display, and approach and avoidance behavior were the four dependent variables. Consumer involvement was tested as the moderator in present study. 202 male and female university students participated in the study by observing one of four window display and completing a survey that measured first impressions of the window display, mental imagery, arousal response, attitude toward display, approach-avoidance behavior, and consumer involvement. The overall results showed that the context setting of a window display had significant effects on consumers' mental imagery and arousal response. Mental imagery and arousal response also had a significant influence on the attitude toward the display and consumers' approach behavior. Background music, however, showed no statistically significant effect on mental imagery nor on arousal response. Consumer involvement also had no interaction effect on the context setting of a window display-mental imagery relationship. The findings of the present study provide an important implication that window display with a context setting can improve consumers' positive behaviors. Therefore, <b>visual</b> <b>merchandiser</b> can effectively use of this information to achieve their ultimate goals of increasing purchasing behaviors. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{purposes}} of this study were to investigate consumers' responses (aesthetic response, approach response, and perceived risk) to two types of visual merchandise displays (full size mannequin and flat hanging display) in an in-store retail setting. An interest for this study arises from retailers' constant effort to differentiate themselves from other retailers and increase retention through in-store entertainment or "shopper-tainment". Kotler (1973 / 74, p. 50) defined atmospherics as "the conscious designing of space to create specific effects in buyers to enhance purchase likelihood". An aspect of effective atmospherics is known as visual merchandising – "how merchandise is visually communicated to the customer" by the retailer (Kerfoot et al., 2003, p. 143). Many retailers have specific <b>visual</b> <b>merchandisers</b> who strive to create the most attractive and beneficial type of window and in-store displays to attract customers and give information about products. In-store displays also provide customers with a mental image of how merchandise can be used or combined. A model, based on the S-O-R model (introduced by Mehrabian and Russell in 1974), was proposed that a stimulus, in this case display type (flat hanging display, full size mannequin) can influence a behavioral response in a consumer, in this case approach response and perceived risk, which is mediated by that consumer's affective or cognitive response, which in this is case is aesthetic response. An additional component added to the traditional S-O-R model was shopping value as a moderator. Shopping value refers to a customer's orientation or goal while shopping, measured by hedonic score. To test the proposed model, a convenience sample of 76 males and 76 females was employed. The independent variable for this study was display type (full size mannequin or flat hanging display) for each gender, which was performed twice due to stimulus sampling procedure. The moderator was shopping value; the dependent variables were aesthetic response, approach response and perceived risk. Cronbach's alpha was used to test internal consistency of each measure. An ANOVA was used to compare participants' responses between the two experimental days; i. e., test to see if the styles of clothing in the displays affected the responses. A MANOVA analysis was used to examine relationships between the independent variable (display type) and dependent variables (aesthetic response, approach response and perceived risk). A second MANOVA was run to test the moderating relationship of shopping value (hedonic) on dependent variables (aesthetic response, approach response, perceived risk) caused by display type. Pearson's Correlation was utilized to examine the correlation relationships between the dependent variables (aesthetic response, approach response and perceived risk). A post hoc ANOVA analysis was run between gender and shopping value to examine gender differences in hedonic shopping value scores. Lastly, an exploratory analysis was conducted to provide the reader with ideas for future research in identifying specific demographic characteristics and their relationship to consumers' utilitarian shopping value. The results of this study support the significance of visual merchandising in a retail environment. The results demonstrate that all individuals (regardless of their gender or shopping value) had a higher aesthetic response (which led to an increased approach response and decreased perceived risk) to the clothing displayed in a full size mannequin display than to the flat hanging display. Unexpectedly, male respondents had a preference for the full size mannequin as did female respondents. Expectedly, females had a higher score for hedonic shopping value than males did in this study. Hedonic shopping value did not play a role as a moderator, whereas all respondents had a higher aesthetic response leading to an increased approach response and decreased perceived risk associated with the full size mannequin. This study offers further support for the S-O-R model introduced by Mehrabian and Russell (1974). The results of this study support the significance of visual merchandising by in a retail environment. This study suggests that a customer's mental imagery processing through viewing a retailers visual display can raise aesthetic response and therefore encourage approach response and reduce perceived risk associated with the products displayed. This study suggests that all consumers (regardless of gender or shopping value) prefer exciting, realistic and aesthetically pleasing visual displays, but require a full size mannequin display to raise their aesthetic response, approach response and reduce perceived risk associated with the items displayed. The limitations of this study include the use of convenience sampling which means {{the results of this study}} cannot be generalized beyond the product category (college licensed merchandise) and sample...|$|R
