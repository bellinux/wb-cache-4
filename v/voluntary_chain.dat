Agency theory maintains {{that the need for}} control over service quality, financial risk, and the market environment affect the choice of governance form. Prior agency research emphasizes alternative governance structures that principals employ, given local market conditions, agent incentives, and risk preferences. The study augments the established principal-agent perspective with a discussion of entrepreneurial motivations to join hotel alliances. The study analyzes the choice between independent ownership and affiliation with a <b>voluntary</b> <b>chain</b> as well as the choice between integration and franchising.

O foco do nosso trabalho é diretamente entre a periferia do centro urbano de Brasília, as Cidades Satélites, distantes de uns poucos a várias dezenas de quilômetros da mesma, surgidas da necessidade de abrigar a população vizinha à parte planejada, o plano piloto, como se chamou posteriormente. This essay, {{submitted}} to the Marketing Department of the Escola de Administração de Empresas de São Paulo - Fundação Getúlio Vargas, in partial fulfilment of the requeriments of the Master's Degree-in Busínes. Asdministration; presents the situation of small scale grocers - their organizational structure, objectives and operational methods. This study has been divided into seven chapters. First, the author examines the dynamic aspects of the distribution flow where changes occur due to alteration of management objectives and strategies in the channel or interested agencies, as a mirror of environmental needs. From this standpoint, the significant éhanges which have ocurred in Brazil {{and the necessity of}} providing functional specialization for the people who make up the actual distribution system are viewed. It then covers the evolution and present day struc ture of the institution chich integrates the retail and whole sale business, the <b>voluntary</b> <b>chain,</b> as a consistent answer within its native land as well as other countries, in the search for efficiency and affectiveness in the distribution of products. Its offers explanation, at the same time, of the operational, political and organizational models. It presents the analysis of the small scalers in the towns surrounding Brasília, which reveals their lack of ony organization, qualified Iabour force or sufficient funds, and it pIaces stress on the <b>voluntary</b> <b>chain</b> as an aIternative solution to this faulty situation by means of adequate technological assistance.

50|$|Food {{distribution}} in Latin America is mainly dominated by large distributors and chains. Efforts {{have been made}} to compete with the industrialization of the food distribution system through the establishment of four types of organizations: consumer purchasing organizations, consumer cooperatives, <b>voluntary</b> <b>chains,</b> and retailer purchasing associations. Consumer purchasing organizations are groups of families who buy food together. The benefits of joining one of these organizations are the reduced cost and improved variety in diet that comes from purchasing food with other families. Consumer cooperatives differ from consumer purchasing organizations in that they are constituted by groups of individuals who work together to secure high quality food for low prices. The cooperatives are analogous to a food union that actively works to secure the rights of its consumers. <b>Voluntary</b> <b>chains</b> are organizations of privately-owned retailers and food wholesalers who operate as one economic body. These groups form contracts to work under, but are economically independent of one another. Retailer purchasing organizations are groups of retailers who purchase products as though they were a single buyer. Members within these organizations are all involved in the purchasing of goods, but do not form contracts.|$|R
40|$|In the markets-as-networks {{approach}} business {{networks are}} conceived as dynamic actor structures, giving focus to exchange relationships and actors’ capabilities {{to control and}} co-ordinate activities and resources. Researchers have shared an understanding that actors’ actions are crucial {{for the development of}} business networks and for network dynamics. However, researchers have mainly studied firms as business actors and excluded individuals, although both firms and individuals can be seen as business actors. This focus on firms as business actors has resulted in a paucity of research on human action and the exchange of intangible resources in business networks, e. g. social exchange between individuals in social networks. Consequently, the current conception of business networks fails to appreciate the richness of business actors, the human character of business action and the import of social action in business networks. The central assumption in this study is that business actors are multidimensional and that their specific constitution in any given situation is determined by human interaction in social networks. Multidimensionality is presented as a concept for exploring how business actors act in different situations and how actors simultaneously manage multiple identities: individual, organisational, professional, business and network identities. The study presents a model that describes the multidimensionality of actors in business networks and conceptualises the connection between social exchange and human action in business networks. Empirically the study explores the change that has taken place in pharmaceutical retailing in Finland during recent years. The phenomenon of emerging pharmacy networks is highly contemporary in the Nordic countries, where the traditional license-based pharmacy business is changing. The study analyses the development of two Finnish pharmacy chains, one integrated and one <b>voluntary</b> <b>chain,</b> and the network structures and dynamics in them. Social Network Analysis is applied to explore the social structures within the pharmacy networks. The study shows that emerging pharmacy networks are multifaceted phenomena where political, economic, social, cultural, and historical elements together contribute to the observed changes. Individuals have always been strongly present in the pharmacy business and the development of pharmacy networks provides an interesting example of human actors’ influence in the development of business networks. The dynamics or forces driving the network development can be linked to actors’ own economic and social motives for developing the business. The study highlights the central role of individuals and social networks {{in the development of the}} two studied pharmacy networks. The relation between individuals and social networks is reciprocal. The social context of every individual enables multidimensional business actors. The mix of various identities, both individual and collective identities, is an important part of network dynamics. Social networks in pharmacy networks create a platform for exchange and social action, and social networks enable and support business network development...|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} Americanisation of food {{retailing}} in Spain while making a running comparison with developments in Britain and more especially, within {{the development of}} self-service techniques. This international comparison helps to ascertain the evolution and modernisation of food retailing in two distinct competitive environments. The {{aim of this study}} is to understand how Americanisation and retail innovation take place in a late-comer like Spain in the early stages of the self-service revolution. The comparison between Spain and the UK facilitates how different starting points favoured differentiated entrepreneurial options which, finally led to similar positions or modes of development. The Americanization of Spanish retailing is assessed against the backdrop of developments elsewhere in Europe. New archival evidence allows us to highlight specific aspects of the path to the Spanish modernization of food distribution. In addition to American aid, there were other elements that were crucial to the modernization process, chief among these being the contacts between Spanish and European businessmen and the influence of <b>voluntary</b> <b>chains</b> of cooperation. ...|$|R

40|$|The study {{sought to}} find out {{financial}} challenges encountered by retail SMEs operating in a multi-currency environment with particular reference to Gweru Urban in Zimbabwe. The replacement of the Zimbabwean dollar by foreign currencies {{gave birth to a}} multi-currency environment. The adoption of multi-currencies was necessitated by the need to curb inflationary pressures which characterized the economy up to April 2009. Convenience sampling was used to select 150 retail SMEs. The data were collected using questionnaires. The questionnaires were filled either by the owners of the SMEs or their managers. The study established that retail SMEs were facing several financial challenges in a multi- currency environment. The challenges included shortage of liquidity in the economy which resulted in low sales due to depressed consumer demand. In turn low sales negatively affected the profitability of the SMEs. High interest rates constrained the ability of SMEs to raise finance through bank loans and overdrafts. The use of personal savings and retained profits as sources of finance implies that SMEs could only raise limited amounts of capital. The financial position of the SMEs was also worsened by high operating expenses and lack of trade credit. In light of these financial challenges the study recommends that the Zimbabwean government should adopt a long-term policy {{on the use of the}} foreign currency. It is also imperative that the government of Zimbabwe swallows its pride and officially makes arrangements with South Africa or the United States of America in order to have an increased supply of the rand or US dollar. The SMEs should also devise survival strategies such as formation of strategic alliances and <b>voluntary</b> <b>chains...</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} be {{prepared}} for future environmental regulations and to improve market competitiveness, companies are realizing that they have to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a supply chain perspective. Supply chain GHG emissions account for around 75  % of the whole GHG emissions from an industry sector, while companies’ direct GHG emissions average only 14  % of their supply chain GHG emissions prior to use and disposal across all industries [1]. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) [2] released one report certifying that managing supply chain GHG emissions can effectively avoid exposure to lack of preparedness for complying with carbon regulations. In fact, numerous firms from the electronic industry (i.e., HP and DELL) and retail industry (i.e., Walmart) have already devoted themselves to <b>voluntary</b> supply <b>chain</b> GHG emissions reduction programs. Although there is so far no policy targeted on supply chain GHG emissions reduction, researchers have recognized that companies in pursuit of green supply chain strategies could leverage the opportunities offered by market-based instruments such as emission trading. Gupta and Palsule-Desai [3] mention that considering the social cost of carbon emissions in greening supply chain is one of future research opportunities. Long and Young [4] study intervention options to enhance the management of supply chain GHG emissions in the UK. They clarify supply chain tax, emission trading, and credit schemes as economic instruments among others to control supply chain emissions.|$|R
40|$|I {{study how}} {{organizational}} form and local market structure influence retail firms' corporate social performance (CSP). The theoretical model {{is based on}} agency theory, which in its origin focuses on the dyad between the principal and the agent. I extend this perspective and examine how characteristics of the environment outside the dyad influence the outcomes. Retail stores vary in their organizational form and thereby in their incentives to maximize profits. I hypothesize that the different incentives, together with differences in monitoring costs and principal demand influence CSP. Further, developments in agency theory {{have suggested that the}} local market structure can influence the effects of the chain-store contracts. Competition can give corporate stores stronger incentives to maximize profits, and reputation effects can increase the profitability of CSP. The main contribution of this dissertation is testing these predictions empirically with data on the CSP of retail stores and chains. The dissertation consists of an introduction, three independent empirical articles, and a conclusion. In the first article (“Franchising, local market characteristics and alcohol sales to minors in retail”) I study how the influence of organizational form (franchised vs corporate store) on CSP depends on competition, market size and public monitoring and sanctions. As the measure of CSP I use the results of alcohol purchase attempts done by underage teens in retail stores. Control variables are collected from other sources. As hypothesized I find that franchised stores are more likely to sell alcohol to minors, and that they are more sensitive to the risk of sanctions. However, I find no relationship between competition and performance, and corporate stores and not franchised stores improve their performance in small markets. The second article (“Market structure, chain membership and food hygiene in retail”) studies how chain membership and competition influence food hygiene in supermarkets. In Denmark, the “Smiley scheme” makes the results of hygiene inspections by food authorities public. I hypothesize a U-shaped relationship where low and high levels of competition give better quality, since stores with little competition are located in small markets with strong reputation effects. I further hypothesize that chain stores are less sensitive to competition, since chains standardize quality. I get robust support for the U-shaped relationship between competition and quality, but limited support for the lower sensitivity of chain stores to competition. In the third article (“Retail chains’ corporate social responsibility signaling”) I study how the retail chain's organizational form influences its CSP signaling. I hypothesize that vertically integrated chains are more likely to signal CSP since they have less problems getting their stores to commit to common investments in CSP than other chains. I also include other hypotheses testing signaling theory. The data comes from a content analysis of the web pages of 208 retail chains in the Norwegian market, combined with information from other sources. As hypothesized, I find that franchise chains are significantly less likely and plural and <b>voluntary</b> <b>chains</b> marginally less likely to signal CSP than integrated chains. Two of the other three hypotheses testing signaling theory are supported. In total, the findings give partial support to agency theory. For the direct effects of organizational form the hypotheses are supported. Franchised stores have lower social performance when monitoring costs are high but there are smaller differences between independent and chain stores when monitoring costs are lower. The chain-store contract also has consequences for CSP at the chain level. For the moderating effects of the local market structure, agency theory is not supported...|$|R
40|$|Food safety {{economists have}} raised {{numerous}} questions {{according to the}} emergence and the multiplication of safety quality management system within the food supply chain. However, few research deal with the voluntary implementation by firms of these systems (Segerson, 1999; Venturini, 2003; Noelke- Caswell, 2000). Our paper aims to develop a unified analytical framework of these research. We obtain three results. First, in a market model when the mandatory threat is strong, the voluntary adoption of safety measures is an equilibrium without need of the cost differential assumption (Segerson, 1999) nor of a reputation effect (Venturini, 2003). Second, when the mandatory threat is weak the reputation effect {{and the rule of}} liability could induce the voluntary adoption on different extent depending on the situation of safety contamination. Third, in a supply chain model we introduce a retailer and show that a well designed contract offered by the retailer induce upstream firms to voluntarily implement safety measures. Private incentives are thus very powerful and can be used as the sole mechanism to implement the efficient system.

40|$|Globalisation {{and global}} {{challenges}} demand new governance models. The perceived {{success of the}} value chain as a governance mechanism for delivering better social and environmental outcomes has led {{a growing number of}} mainstream companies to incorporate brands associated with initiatives such as Fairtrade, the Forest Stewardship Council, and Rainforest Alliance into their procurement and marketing strategies. By buying from ethically certified producers and selling ethically labelled products, retailers and manufacturers are effectively outsourcing a significant part of their supply chain governance to third parties considered to have greater moral credibility than the companies themselves. This paper explores the implications of such outsourcing for the companies concerned, and in particular the dangers to both corporate reputation, and to the wider credibility of alternative governance models. Drawing on empirical data from a longitudinal study of Kenyan communities producing for Fairtrade, and situating this within debates about <b>voluntary</b> self-regulation, value <b>chain</b> governance, and international development, the paper details how Fairtrade initiatives have been adopted as part of a governance outsourcing strategy, {{and the extent to which}} they are able to helps companies meet their societal responsibilities. The paper concludes with a discussion of the lessons for corporate strategy and the management of governance issues. The paper brings together ethical governance theory and empirical findings to examine the shifting nature of governance in global value chains, and the implications of this shift for mainstream companies. In particular, it examines one of the more mature models of ethical value chain governance, Fairtrade, and how this is being used by business...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable supply {{management}} or governance recently receives much attention in businesses. Scholars and practitioners likewise advocate it {{as a means}} of risk-minimization and as opportunity for value creation. To further stimulate the trend towards sustainable supply chains, scholars can contribute {{to the understanding of the}} field by increased efforts of theory-building on different aspects of supply chain governance. This master thesis explores factors that guide the decision-making of focal companies among <b>voluntary</b> sustainable supply <b>chain</b> governance instruments and relates the governance process and instrument choices to different intensities of supply chain governance. The paper uses two connectable theoretical models which are based on literature syntheses in the supply chain field to 1) describe company decision-making as a sustainable supply chain governance process consisting of four steps and several components 2) examine varying intensities of sustainable supply chain governance based on sixteen factors relating to the governance process, characteristics of chosen instruments, and strategic integration found with sustainable supply chain governance in a respective company. The models are applied to five Dutch focal companies in two different sectors: the electronics industry and the construction industry. Results show that all companies perceive a basic underlying business case in SSCG. While companies vary considerably in their SSCG process in the choice for instruments the same set of factors were considered for strategic decision-making. It is further found that where these decision-making factors act confining to choices, barriers may be lowered by deciding for instruments that involve engagement of other parties in execution. The assessment of intensity of practiced sustainable supply chain governance reveales that companies demonstrate varying performance, with two companies from the electronics industry showing the most advanced level of intensity (proactive level). A major finding relates to the fact that companies with an intense level of shared value creation mechanisms and practice do not necessarily show the same advanced practice with regard to mechanisms aimed at triggering supplier and employee sustainable behavior...|$|R
