6000|$|I {{say that}} {{democracy}} can never prove itself beyond cavil, until it founds and luxuriantly grows its own forms of art, poems, schools, theology, displacing all that exists, or {{that has been}} produced anywhere in the past, under opposite influences. It is curious to me that while so many <b>voices,</b> <b>pens,</b> minds, in the press, lecture-rooms, in our Congress, &c., are discussing intellectual topics, pecuniary dangers, legislative problems, the suffrage, tariff and labor questions, and the various business and benevolent needs of America, with propositions, remedies, often worth deep attention, there is one need, a hiatus the profoundest, that no eye seems to perceive, no voice to state. Our fundamental want to-day in the United States, with closest, amplest reference to present conditions, and to the future, is of a class, and the clear idea of a class, of native authors, literatuses, far different, far higher in grade than any yet known, sacerdotal, modern, fit to cope with our occasions, lands, permeating the whole mass of American mentality, taste, belief, breathing into it a new breath of life, giving it decision, affecting politics {{far more than the}} popular superficial suffrage, with results inside and underneath the elections of Presidents or Congresses--radiating, begetting appropriate teachers, schools, manners, and, as its grandest result, accomplishing, (what neither the schools nor the churches and their clergy have hitherto accomplish'd, and without which this nation will no more stand, permanently, soundly, than a house will stand without a substratum,) a religious and moral character beneath the political and productive and intellectual bases of the States. For know you not, dear, earnest reader, that the people of our land may all read and write, and may all possess the right to vote--and yet the main things may be entirely lacking?--(and this to suggest them.) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores using non-linguistic vocalization as an {{additional}} modality to augment digital pen input on a tablet computer. We investigated this {{through a set of}} novel interaction techniques and a feasibility study. Typically, digital pen users control one or two parameters using stylus position and sometimes pen pressure. However, in many scenarios the user can benefit from the ability to continuously vary additional parameters. Non-linguistic vocalizations, such as vowel sounds, variation of pitch, or control of loudness have the potential to provide fluid continuous input concurrently with pen interaction. We present a set of interaction techniques that leverage the combination of <b>voice</b> and <b>pen</b> input when performing both creative drawing and object manipulation tasks. Our feasibility evaluation suggests that with little training people can use nonlinguistic vocalization to productively augment digital pen interaction...|$|R
