5000|$|Eventually, Justice {{would form}} another tag team with Morty Rackem, calling {{themselves}} [...] "Pirate Justice." [...] The team would defeat The Clash and <b>V-Squared</b> (Virus and Virus Grande) on multiple occasions. At {{the first annual}} Wrestlelution, Pirate Justice would unsuccessfully become the first ever PWO Tag Team Champions against Jake Crist and Vincent Nothing and <b>V-Squared.</b> A few weeks later, Justice would defeat Benjamin Boone and unsuccessfully face against Michael Montecarlo.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between proton temperature and momentum flux density/unit mass at 1 AU is examined using Helios 1 solar wind data from 1974 to 1980. In high-speed plasma (V greater than 500 km/s) T(p) increases with increasing n(0) <b>V-squared,</b> where n(0) and T(p) are the density and proton temperature at 1 AU and V is the flow speed. In lowspeed plasma (V less than 500 km/s), T(p) does not increase with increasing n(0) <b>V-squared,</b> and perhaps tends to decrease slightly. These basic relationships between T(p) and n(0) <b>V-squared</b> are not significantly affected by stream interactions. A qualitative explanation {{of these results}} is offered {{in the context of}} a solar wind model that includes deposition of momentum and energy extending well outward into the interplanetary medium...|$|R

25|$|At WrestleMania 21, Venis {{competed in}} a 30-man Interpromotional battle royal which was won by Booker T. In {{the summer of}} 2005 he formed another team, <b>V-Squared,</b> with Viscera. While wrestling on Heat, they {{squashed}} {{a number of other}} tag teams including the World Tag Team Champions Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch in a non-title match. On the December 5 episode of Raw, <b>V-Squared</b> participated in a fatal four way match for the World Tag Team Championship, including the champions Big Show and Kane, The Heart Throbs, and Snitsky and Tyson Tomko but were defeated. Venis and Viscera continued to team in 2006, getting another shot at Big Show and Kane's titles, while occasionally having solo matches. In March 2006, Venis suffered a kayfabe injury {{at the hands of the}} Spirit Squad which allowed him to take time off for legitimate elbow surgery, during which about a dozen more bone spurs were removed, six others were shaved down, and a nerve was transplanted.|$|R
50|$|Rock-A-Rolla is a music {{magazine}} covering experimental, avant-garde, {{noise and}} metal artists pushing {{the boundaries of}} music. Launched in late 2005, it is published bi-monthly in the UK by <b>V-Squared</b> Publishing Limited and distributed worldwide, mainly in UK, Canada, USA, Europe and Australia. In the past the magazine has championed such diverse artists as Khanate, Zu, The Locust, Justin Broadrick, Mike Patton, Melvins and others. The current editor-in-chief is Vuk Valcic.|$|R
40|$|A short-pulse CO 2 Doppler lidar with 150 -m range {{resolution}} measured vertical profiles of turbulence and momentum flux. Example measurements are reported of a daytime mixed layer with strong mechanical mixing {{caused by a}} wind speed of 15 m/sec, which exceeded the speed above the capping inversion. The lidar adapted an azimuth scanning technique previously demonstrated by radar. Scans alternating between two elevation angles allow determination of mean U-squared, <b>V-squared,</b> and W-squared. Expressions were derived to estimate the uncertainty in the turbulence parameters. A new processing method, partial Fourier decomposition, has less uncertainty than the filtering used earlier...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} obtain the exact control-to-output and input-to-output {{transfer}} functions for switched DC-to-DC pulse-width modulated power converters is applied to different combinations of operating conditions such as continuous conduction mode (CCM), discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), and discontinuous voltage mode (DVM) and methods of control such as normal voltage mode (NVM), current programming mode (CPM), and <b>V-squared</b> control. The majority of these combinations have not previously had their transfer functions of interest derived to the accuracy provided by the method. The derivation of the method is covered, and the results from its application are verified by simulation. The simulation method is also justied and proposed as an improvement to the methods used by simulation engines for switched mode power supply design such as SIMPLIS...|$|R
25|$|Viscera then {{teamed with}} Val Venis to form <b>Vâ€“Squared.</b> They teamed {{together}} for nearly nine months, mainly on Heat. They challenged for the World Tag Team Championship on several occasions, but never held the title. When Venis was sidelined with a legitimate injury in April 2006, Viscera returned to singles wrestling. He attempted to reconcile with Garcia, but was interrupted and attacked by Umaga during his proposal. Two weeks later, when Garcia was legitimately and accidentally knocked from the ring apron by Charlie Haas and sprained her wrist, {{the incident was}} worked into a storyline of Haas and Viscera fighting over Garcia. After Lillian declared {{she wanted to be}} just friends, Haas seemingly raked Viscera in the eye, with Viscera feigning to accidentally Samoan slam Lillian. After Viscera gave Lillian the Samoan slam, both men laughed about the incident, in the process turning Viscera heel once again. The team split up when Haas reunited with Shelton Benjamin to reform The World's Greatest Tag Team.|$|R
40|$|Principles of coronal heating via basic {{electrodynamic}} effects, viz., resonant {{absorption of}} Alfven surface waves (quiescent) and magnetic tearing instabilities (impulsive), are detailed to argue three principles {{which may have}} application to late-type evolved stars. First, if one observes that B-squared/ 8 pi {{is much greater than}} rho times <b>v-squared</b> in a stellar atmosphere, then the observed magnetic field must originate in an interior dynamo. Second, low mass-loss rates could imply the presence of closed magnetic flux loops within the outer atmosphere, which constrain hydrodynamic flows when the magnetic body forces exceed the driving forces. Third, given that such magnetic loops effect an enhancement of the local heating rate, a positive correlation is predicted between the existence of a corona and low mass-loss rates. Application of these principles is made {{in the case of the}} peculiar M giant star HD 4174, which is purported to have a kilogauss magnetic field. Several of its spectroscopic peculiarities are shown to be consistent with the above principles, and further observational checks are suggested. Possible application to dMe and RS CVn objects is sketched...|$|R

The optical light curves show a single hump with largest amplitude in the V filter, while the IR light curves show a double hump sinusoidal variation. Flickering is evident in both the optical and IR light curves, with the largest amplitude in optical B light. Through subtraction of the low state fluxes from our high state values, a flux distribution of the accretion column is obtained which peaks at 0. 55 micron and becomes <b>v-squared</b> in the IR, consistent with current cyclotron models. Comparison of the observed IR variations throughout the orbit with the expected variations due to an M 4 star heated by an accretion column at an inclination of 66 deg suggests that the IR light is a combination of the secondary star plus contributions from two emitting poles...|$|R
