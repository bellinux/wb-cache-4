5000|$|In 1933, {{as part of}} the {{sweeping}} National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), Congress allocated $25 million for the creation of [...] "subsistence homesteads" [...] for dislocated industrial workers. Over the course of the program’s eleven-year history, the federal government seeded nearly 100 planned, cooperative communities. Norvelt, in southwestern Pennsylvania, was the fourth. The idea for the program was a throwback to the Jeffersonian ideal of a [...] "back to the land" [...] movement, popularized by Americans who promoted small-scale subsistence farming as an antidote to economic exploitation and the alienation of modern life. The idea gained strength in the 1920s among a wide variety of progressive organizations, including church-related groups such as the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) which was the social services arm of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). During the 1920s, the AFSC had become deeply concerned with the violence that resulted from labor strife, particularly in the bituminous coal fields of Appalachia. So AFSC volunteers traveled to the bituminous-coal regions in West Virginia and Pennsylvania to help the families of striking and unemployed coal miners. The AFSC also believed in the necessity of economic and social justice as a means of insuring lasting peace in this section of the United States. To that end, it clothed and fed the families of unemployed miners during strikes, and later launched subsistence gardening and <b>vocational</b> <b>retraining</b> programs. After the onset of the Great Depression, these experiences placed the AFSC in the forefront of the movement for cooperative communities, {{so much so that the}} Department of the Interior, headed by Altoona native Harold Ickes, in 1933 recruited AFSC staff to guide its subsistence homesteads program.|$|E
5000|$|The National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act (1965) {{established}} {{the principle of}} [...] "payment of industrial injury benefit for prescribed industrial diseases or for personal injury following an accident (e.g., acute blast injury to the ear)," [...] and also gave employees the right “to claim damages from an employer where industrial injuries are sustained.” The Redundant Mineworkers Payments Scheme of 1968 was introduced to ensure that redundant mineworkers having to leave the industry {{at or above the}} age of 55 “would have their income supplemented for a period so that they could adjust themselves in their new circumstances.” In 1966, extensions and improvements were made in the allowances payable out of the Industrial Injuries Fund to people who had been injured before 5 July 1948 and who were entitled to weekly payments of worker's compensation. In 1968, various steps were taken to reduce the severity with which the [...] "wage-stop" [...] operated, a regressive mechanism which restricted the amount of assistance payable to an unemployed person. For miners, the Coal Industry Act 1965 introduced aid towards severance payments for miners about to be made redundant or for the <b>vocational</b> <b>retraining</b> of staff, while the Coal Industry Act 1967 provided subsidisation of redundancy and early retirement. Under the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) (Amendment) Act 1967, men who were diagnosed as having over 50% disablement through pneumoconiosis “were allowed to have their accompanying bronchitis and emphysema treated as part of the disease,” although only 3,000 men “fell into this category.” In May 1969, adenocarcinoma of the nasal sinuses “in woodworkers in the furniture industry” became a prescribed occupational disease.|$|E
40|$|Unemployment is a {{long term}} problem of the present society. For many people, finding a new job is {{complicated}} because {{of some kind of}} handicap. Such handicaps include age, gender, lack of qualification, or even belonging to certain minority group. In these cases, people remain unemployed for a longer time, which leads to further devaluation of the human capital. Employment offices try to help their job-seekers using active employment policy instruments. This paper is then focused on the <b>vocational</b> <b>retraining</b> instrument in relation to long term unemployed. The objective of the paper is to establish efficiency of <b>vocational</b> <b>retraining</b> and the factors that influence it. The technique of secondary analysis of public documents of the Employment Office in Písek for the period 2005 through 2010 was chosen for the performance of the research. The research has shown that short-term unemployed having secondary education with school-leaving examination (SSLC) and younger age groups (up to 30 years of age) are more often placed in <b>vocational</b> <b>retraining.</b> On the contrary, members of the group of job-seekers with low ? primary education and/or aged over 50 is very rarely placed in <b>vocational</b> <b>retraining.</b> Yet lack of qualification and higher age are risk factors for long term unemployment origination. If these two factors are joined also with very long unemployment (over 1 year), there is a minimum chance to participate in <b>vocational</b> <b>retraining.</b> The positive effects of <b>vocational</b> <b>retraining</b> for long term unemployed include that they have large chance of placement in the labour market within 6 months. Selection for <b>vocational</b> <b>retraining</b> is performed on the basis of cooperation of the labour provision consultant with the job-seeker.

It explores the evolution of the social approach to persons with disabilities, that in the course of history changed attitudes of rejection in tolerant attitude. Today, the status of a group of people with disabilities is affected by broader social aspects, which include social consciousness and a focus of national policies. The status of these groups of people are also shaped by other influences, including lack of education, the existence of barriers, ignorance of employers and low motivation. Employment has many meanings to humans in the form of financial security, social contact or as the creator of the daily regime.

40|$|The {{success of}} further <b>vocational</b> {{training}} and <b>retraining</b> is evaluated {{in this paper}} {{on the basis of}} a comparison group approach and using a new data source. For this the IAB employment sample was extended to include details about further training and retraining measures. For a cohort of people completing further training or retraining measures in 1986 the authors analyse as an example the effects on the individual labour market success between 1986 and 1990. The access requirements for these measures are reconstructed for the participants of the further training and retraining measures and for a control group. The control group is made up of people who were employed for a short time in the period 1983 - 1986 and, like the participants in the further training and retraining measures, previously claimed unemployment benefit. By means of a hierarchical matching method, statistical doubles are found for about 90 % of all the participants in the further training and retraining measures. On the basis of 985 pairs of participants and comparison persons, event-analytical estimations are made concerning the return to employment subject to social security contributions after a course of further training or retraining or after the period of short-term employment. In addition the determinants of the duration of this first phase of employment are estimated. The results suggest that in the period under examination participation in further training or retraining has a weak positive employment effect for individuals who were unemployed before beginning the training measure if they take up work immediately after the measure. However, further training and retraining have a significantly negative effect - seen in relation to the control group - on remaining in employment. The authors interpret this as a consequence of employment-relevant deficits that can not be influenced by further training or retraining. Further detailed evaluation studies with (extended) business statistics can help to clarify this.

Second, the anticipatory nature of support situations, which are forward-looking and focused on decisions concerning future actions, will be underlined and analytical categories put forward. Finally, a real support situation will be analyzed using these categories. The context in which the analysis takes place is a vocational training community organization that incorporates social economic values and has a dual mission to integrate and train the low-skilled, long-term unemployed. In terms of methodology, the analytical tools are drawn from the field of interactional sociolinguistics and mediated discourse analysis.

The paper shows that the old system of <b>vocational</b> <b>retraining</b> has largely collapsed, but very little has arisen to take its place.

At the same time, the availability of appropriate training is limited and it is extremely expensive in relation to the resources available to new private employers.

Four criteria for successful mastery are specified: 1) completion, 2) academic achievement, 3) physical and psychical well-being, and 4) vocational reintegration. Rather stable characteristics such as participants' age, education and motivation for the choice of occupation are assumed to be potential predictors of success, as well as more dynamic characteristics, developing and changing during the course of retraining. Within the dynamic characteristics structural (e. g. housing), class-specific (e. g. classroom climate), and individual factors (e. g. self-efficacy, status of health) are differentiated.   In order to evaluate the relational pattern of  the characteristics described a longitudinal study with the participants of a two-year retraining program conducted by the Berufsförderungswerk Berlin was realized. The participants were questioned every six months, i. e. five times during the two year retraining program. The statistical analyses show that primarily motivation for the choice of re-training, self-efficacy and status of health have a substantial meaning for succeeding in or failing the <b>vocational</b> <b>retraining.</b> Participants, who choose the retraining out of self-motivation and out of interest, who are confident of mastering the retraining and whose physical condition is good, have a good chance to finish the program successfully.

The question, whether vocational reintegration itself will be successful or not, cannot be answered with the data at issue; hence, further research is needed.   </html...|$|E

40|$|Study design: Survey. Objectives: To {{explore the}} process of {{reintegration}} in paid work following a traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), including the role of early expectations of individual patients regarding return to work, indicators of success of job reintegration and a description of reintegration interventions and barriers. Setting: Dutch rehabilitation centre with special department for patients with spinal cord injuries. Methods: Descriptive analysis of data gathered by a mailed questionnaire, which was returned by 57 persons (response 83 %) with traumatic SCI, aged 18 - 60 years, and data of earlier expectations reported by the individual patients during the rehabilitation admission following SCI from 1990 to 1998. Results: Of 49 respondents who were employed {{at the moment of}} the SCI, 45 % expected to be able to resume work. These positive expectations were associated with a higher educational level. In 67 %, return to work was successful. The chance to reintegrate successfully was better if the patient expected to resume work. Logistic regression analysis did not reveal other significant indicators. About one-third of the 49 respondents working preinjury followed <b>vocational</b> <b>retraining,</b> which was successful for most of them so far. In the majority of work situations modi. cations have been made, such as job adaptations and reduction of working hours. Several unmet needs regarding reintegration interventions were also reported. Conclusions: Positive expectations regarding resumption of work after a SCI are an important indicator of successful reintegration in work. An active role of the rehabilitation team is recommended in drawing up a vocational reintegration plan to prepare the patient, the employer and professionals involved in the reintegration process...|$|E
