40|$|Recent FPGA-based {{implementations}} {{of network}} virtualization represent {{a significant step}} forward in network performance and scalability. Although these systems {{have been shown to}} provide orders of magnitude higher performance than solutions using software-based routers, straightforward reconfiguration of hardware-based <b>virtual</b> <b>networks</b> over time is a challenge. In this paper, we present the implementation of a reconfigurable network virtualization substrate that combines several partially-reconfigurable hardware virtual routers with software virtual routers. The update of hardware-based <b>virtual</b> <b>networks</b> in our system is supported via real-time partial FPGA reconfiguration. Hardware <b>virtual</b> <b>networks</b> can be dynamically reconfigured in {{a fraction of a second}} without affecting other <b>virtual</b> <b>networks</b> operating in the same FPGA. A heuristic has been developed to allocate <b>virtual</b> <b>networks</b> with diverse bandwidth requirements and network characteristics on this heterogeneous virtualization substrate. Experimental results show that the reconfigurable virtual routers can forward packets at line rate. Partial reconfiguration allows for 20 x faster hardware reconfiguration than a previous approach which migrated hardware <b>virtual</b> <b>networks</b> to software.

30|$|Both the {{topology}} of {{the substrate}} networks {{and that of}} the <b>virtual</b> <b>networks</b> were randomly generated by using the topology generator BRITE[24], with the BA- 2 [25] algorithm, a method that generates network topologies similar to those found on the Internet. For the substrate network, the link delays were the values given by BRITE. Since the requested delay of the links of the <b>virtual</b> <b>networks</b> must be greater than those of the links of the substrate network, these were defined by multiplying the value returned by BRITE by a random number derived from a uniform distribution. For Type 1 <b>virtual</b> <b>networks,</b> the delay was calculated as the value given by BRITE multiplied by a number up to 15. For Type 2 <b>virtual</b> <b>networks,</b> the delay was calculated to be the value returned by BRITE multiplied by a number up to 10. For Type 3 <b>virtual</b> <b>networks,</b> the delay was the value returned by BRITE multiplied by a number up to 5.|$|R
30|$|In recent years, {{the network}} {{community}} from academia and industry {{has focused on}} the creation and management of <b>virtual</b> <b>networks</b> [1]. The motivation for <b>virtual</b> <b>networks</b> is to allow the experimentation of new protocols and new topologies, over production networks, without changing the underlying network. Through such an approach, <b>virtual</b> <b>networks</b> can be created, removed and modified, bringing to reality the possibility of easily deploying new network applications and services [2]. The procedures and mechanisms used to manage these <b>virtual</b> <b>networks</b> are part of the so-called Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) topic. Despite the fact that SDNs are already widely deployed, there are still a few number of key research questions that need to be answered [3], mainly related to some key ongoing research challenges and consideration of the impact on the previously dominant layered architectures of computer networks.|$|R

Originally a 50/50 joint venture founded in January, 2005 between South Korean wireless operator SK Telecom and American Internet services provider EarthLink, early losses caused EarthLink to stop providing additional funding in fall of 2007. SK Telecom provided the required additional funding to sustain Helio, which was re-organized as Helio LLC, and by January 2008, SK Telecom had assumed an increased ownership stake and with it, operational control of the joint venture. Although SK Telecom publicly pledged to support Helio, SK Telecom entered into talks to sell the company to rival MVNO Virgin Mobile USA. Virgin Mobile USA closed the acquisition of Helio and its 170,000 subscribers on August 22, 2008. Virgin Mobile USA exited the postpaid wireless business and retired the Helio brand on May 25, 2010.|$|E
