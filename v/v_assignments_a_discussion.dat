40|$|This paper extends {{previous}} research on congested service facilities to generalized service distributions, a significant extension given the limitations of exponential distributions for networked computer job modeling. Building on the framework first presented in Mendelson and Whang (1990), we present fundamental theorems for non-priority M/G/ 1 queues, nonpreemptive M/G/ 1 queues, and preemptive-resume M/G/ 1 queues. For non-priority M/G/ 1 queues and nonpreemptive M/G/ 1 queues, these theorems establish optimal assignment rules and incentivecompatible pricing schemes. For preemptive-resume M/G/ 1 queues, we prove that the total delay cost {{is less than the}} total delay cost of nonpreemptive M/G/ 1 if service times are heterogeneous with decreasing failure rates. This result supports the traditional delay cost to service time (i i c <b>v)</b> <b>assignment</b> rule as <b>a</b> good heuristic for preemptive-resume M/G/ 1 queues...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{deterministic}} past history of the Universe can be uniquely reconstructed from knowledge of the present mass density field, the latter being inferred from the three-dimensional distribution of luminous matter, assumed to be tracing the distribution of dark matter up to a known bias. Reconstruction ceases to be unique below those scales - a few Mpc - where multistreaming becomes significant. Above 6 h- 1 Mpc we propose and implement an effective Monge-Ampère-Kantorovich method of unique reconstruction. At such scales the Zel'dovich approximation is well satisfied and reconstruction becomes an instance of optimal mass transportation, a problem which goes back to Monge. After discretization into N point masses one obtains <b>an</b> <b>assignment</b> problem that can be handled by effective algorithms with not more than O(N 3) time complexity and reasonable CPU time requirements. Testing against N-body cosmological simulations gives over 60 per cent of exactly reconstructed points. We apply several interrelated tools from optimization theory that were not used in cosmological reconstruction before, such as the Monge-Ampère equation, its relation to the mass transportation problem, the Kantorovich duality and the auction algorithm for optimal <b>assignment.</b> <b>A</b> self-contained <b>discussion</b> of relevant notions and techniques is provided...|$|R
40|$|This project {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} storing energy from offshore wind power. Throughout the assignment we have examined the potential resulting advantages, that comes from creating a new mechanical product; a product able to store the energy from turbines. We have examined the political and economical situation in Denmark focusing on the transit to sustainable energy. To gain more knowledge two expert interviews were conducted; Troels Friis Pedersen, a professor in wind turbines from the Danish Technical University and Søren Dyck-Madsen from The Danish Ecological Council an expert on energy and politics. This project entails two differentiated analysis. The first one is a sociotechnical system analysis, that offers insight on the current politics and market participants and what underlies the decision {{about the future of}} sustainable energy. The second one is a partial iteration process analysis, {{made on the basis of}} our prototype and contributes to optimise our product. At the end we will reach a conclusion that combines the two analysis about possible methods of storing sustainable energy.

50|$|Let V be a finite-dimensional real {{vector space}} and let b1 and b2 be two ordered bases for V. It is a {{standard}} result in linear algebra that there exists a unique linear transformation A : V → V that takes b1 to b2. The bases b1 and b2 {{are said to have}} the same orientation (or be consistently oriented) if A has positive determinant; otherwise they have opposite orientations. The property of having the same orientation defines an equivalence relation on the set of all ordered bases for V. If V is non-zero, there are precisely two equivalence classes determined by this relation.

40|$|Abstract: Most {{informed}} educators {{agree that}} e-Learning should create {{a paradigm shift}} away from traditional teaching models, yet in practice this {{is extremely difficult to}} achieve. Typically, teachers use computer networks (internet or intranets) mainly for email, dissemination of information that frequently just mirrors traditional book material, <b>assignments,</b> and perhaps <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> forum. In this paper, we examine reasons why there has been so little departure away from conventional teaching paradigms. We look beyond Virtual Learning Environments to Managed Learning Environments. We look at ways to make this transition a desirable option for both teachers and students. We suggest that when teachers and learners are properly supported within a Managed Learning Environment the workload of teachers is not increased and they enjoy teaching more; also, students learn better (i. e. more efficiently) and with higher motivation...|$|R

40|$|Calibrated Peer Review ™ (CPR), {{a web-based}} {{instructional}} tool developed {{as part of}} the National Science Foundation reform initiatives in undergraduate science education, allows instructors to incorporate multiple writing assignments in large courses without overwhelming the instructor. This study reports successful implementation of CPR in a large, introductory geology course and student learning of geoscience content. For each CPR assignment in this study, students studied web-based and paper resources, wrote an essay, and reviewed seven essays (three from the instructor, three from peers, and their own) on the topic. Although many students expressed negative attitudes and concerns, particularly about the peer review process of this innovative instructional approach, they also recognized the learning potential of completing CPR assignments.

40|$|In the k-center problem, given a metric space V and a {{positive}} integer k, one wants to select k elements (centers) of <b>V</b> and <b>an</b> <b>assignment</b> from <b>V</b> to centers, minimizing the maximum distance between an element of V and its assigned center. One of the most general variants is the capacitated α-fault-tolerant k-center, where centers have a limit {{on the number of}} assigned elements, and, if α centers fail, there is a reassignment from V to non-faulty centers. In this paper, we present a new approach to tackle fault tolerance, by selecting and pre-opening a set of backup centers, then solving the obtained residual instance. For the 0,L-capacitated case, we give approximations with factor 6 for the basic problem, and 7 for the so called conservative variant, when only clients whose centers failed may be reassigned. Our algorithms improve on the previously best known factors of 9 and 17, respectively. Moreover, we consider the case with general capacities. Assuming α is constant, our method leads to the first approximations for this case. We also derive approximations for the capacitated fault- tolerant k-supplier problem...|$|R
