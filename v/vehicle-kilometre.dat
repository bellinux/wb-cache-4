30|$|Public {{transport}} patronage {{is generally}} {{found to be}} highly correlated with quality of service, <b>vehicle-kilometres</b> or <b>vehicle-kilometres</b> per km 2, and the latter is often used as an explanatory variable in demand functions. The {{problem is that there}} are good reasons to believe that although quality of service certainly affects demand, the level of demand also affects the level of service. This issue has been raised by several authors, the perhaps most influential being Mohring [9 – 11] who showed that capacity and quality of service were joint products. His models have also been extended and generalized by Jansson [12, 13] and by Jara-Diaz and Gschwender [14] (see also [15 – 20] for cases were this has been mentioned but incorporated into the model) Despite this, the most common practice in statistical/econometric applications is to assume that quality cause demand and not the other way around. Holmgren [21] applied a Granger causality test to Swedish data and concluded that there was a two-way relationship between public transport patronage and <b>vehicle-kilometres.</b> Failing to take into account a prevailing two-way relationship when estimating a demand model will result in biased estimates.|$|R

30|$|From a microeconomic perspective, {{road freight}} {{transport}} is not seen as a complicated technology. The two inputs, vehicles and drivers, are generally assumed to be perfect complements: they must be used in fixed proportions to produce a given amount of transport, measured in vkm (<b>vehicle-kilometre).</b> The cost function of {{road freight transport}} {{is proportional to the}} vkm output, and the speed of road freight transport is fully determined by the speed limitations and the rules determining the breaks drivers are obliged to take. The complementarity of drivers and vehicles as inputs in the production function is confirmed econometrically. For example, by fitting statistically a constant elasticity of substitution production function with the number of vehicles and drivers as its arguments, [22] found that the elasticity of substitution between these two factors is 0.2, which is low.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{describe}} the inter-province variability of Road Traffic Injury (RTI) mortality on Spanish roads, adjusted for <b>vehicle-kilometres</b> travelled, and to assess the possible role played by the following explicative variables: sociodemographic, structural, climatic and risk conducts. Methods An ecological study design was employed. The mean annual rate of RTI deaths was calculated for the period 2002 – 2004, adjusted for <b>vehicle-kilometres</b> travelled, in the 50 provinces of Spain. The RTI death rate was related with the independent variables described above, using simple and multiple linear regression analysis with backward step-wise elimination. The level of statistical significance was taken as p Results In the period 2002 – 2004 there were 12, 756 RTI deaths in Spain (an average of 4, 242 per year, SD = 356. 6). The mean number of deaths due to RTI per 100 million <b>vehicle-kilometres</b> (mvk) travelled was 1. 76 (SD = 0. 51), with a minimum value of 0. 66 (in Santa Cruz de Tenerife) and a maximum of 3. 31 (in the province of Lugo). All other variables being equal, a higher proportion of kilometres available on high capacity roads, and a higher cultural and education level were associated with lower death rates due to RTI, while the opposite was true for the rate of alcohol consumers and the road traffic volume of heavy vehicles. The variables included in the model accounted for 55. 4 % of the variability in RTI mortality. Conclusion Adjusting RTI mortality rates for the number of <b>vehicle-kilometres</b> travelled enables us to identify the high variability of this cause of death, and its relation with risk factors other than those inherent to human behaviour, such as the type of roads and the type of vehicles using them. </p...|$|R

Second, energy consumption rates are dependent on factors, {{and the introduction of}} homogeneous units which are independent of these factors therefore offers a significant improvement when comparing transport modes. Third, the use of a vehicle energy consumption equation will improve the quality of the assessments.

40|$|In {{order to}} be able to convert <b>vehicle-kilometre</b> data from traffic counts into {{kilometres}} travelled, the daytime occupancy of seven vehicle categories on six different road sites has been counted one week a year in May. The seven categories are: cars, mini-buses, delivery vans, lorries, motorbikes, mopeds, and bicycles. The six road sites are: a motorway, a regional road, a scenic road, and three points inside the built-up area. It is doubtful if the sample is representative; the main aim was to cover the various types of road and, by using the same method, to be able to carry out trend analysis. Occupancy is declining as ownership rates increase for most of the vehicle categories. More than half the cars have no passengers whereby the average occupancy lies considerably below 2. Minibuses, with up to 9 seats, have an average occupancy of just below 2. For the other types of vehicle the averages are: delivery vans - less than 1. 5; lorries ca. 1. 25; motorbikes - less than 1. 2; mopeds ca. 1. 1; and for bicycles — less than 1. 05. There are considerable variations in time and space: at weekends, especially Sundays the occupancy is higher than during the week; the scenic route has the highest occupancy, followed by the motorway - the regional road has a much lower occupancy and is similar to the roads within the built-up area...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{provides}} some results demonstrating {{the impact of}} rain on road safety for France. The risk of injury accident and the added risk in case of rain are estimated for several types of injury accidents which occurred in France for the period 1995 - 2008. Estimations cover the whole of France, in average and according the category of network and element of the road. These results are relevant as they will contribute to implement specific road safety measures. The risk of injury accident in case of rain {{is defined as the}} number of injury accidents per <b>vehicle-kilometre</b> by rainy conditions. The added risk in case of rain is defined as the ratio of the risk of injury accident by rainy conditions divided by the risk of injury accident by no rain. As the number of vehicle kilometres is partly unknown, the rain duration is used in this paper in the place of the number of vehicle-kilometres by rainy conditions. An approximation of the added risk is thus derived. For computing these estimations, two data sources related to injury accidents and rain duration were used: the BAAC (the French Injury Accident File) and Météo-France. In addition, the changes in the added risk in case of rain over the period 1995 - 2008 are described with the help of time series analysis techniques. The results are commented in relation with more detailed results obtained for the Haute-Normandie region in France, and recommendations for improving the computation method are given...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze model {{uncertainty}} and economies of scale of the Swedish national freight transport model system Samgods to changes in its zone-to-zone base matrices. Even though economies of scale {{is an important factor}} in freight transport, there are few studies that analyze model uncertainty and economies of scale at a national level. Compared to many large scale network-based freight models working on aggregated transport flows, an important feature in the Samgods model is that it contains a logistics module that simulates logistics behavior at a disaggregated firm level. The paper studies effects on total tonne- and <b>vehicle-kilometre,</b> modal split, consolidation and logistics costs when the zone-to-zone-matrices are scaled up and down and estimates the economies of scale for Swedish freight transports in Sweden. The results indicate that the logistics model can find new logistics solutions for larger demand volumes, mainly by shifting freight to sea transport. If transport volume increases with one percent, the logistics cost per tonne is on average reduced by about 0. 5 percent. Part of the cost reduction comes from increased consolidation of shipments due to larger transport volumes. The results derived in the paper can serve as a reference for empirical validation and comparisons with other large scale freight models. The paper is a first contribution that tries to fill the knowledge gap on the impact of base matrices on transport model outcomes, such as economies of scale, in the context of a full-fledged real-world freight transport model...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to understand the congestion relief impacts of public transport. It is suggested in this research that none of the existing measures of traffic congestion provides information {{on the extent to which}} traffic congestion is relieved by public transport. In addition, previous studies related to traffic congestion relief have not quantified the relationship between the presence of public transport and the amount of traffic congestion of a city. The research develops a new measurement index which can be used as a relative measure of the city-wide congestion relief impacts of public transport. The proposed research framework consists of three main components: a congestion relief valuation framework that compiles relevant evaluation research and explores mode shift; an experimental modelling approach that analyses changes in congestion measures as a result of alternative public transport scenarios; and a relative measure development method that constructs a congestion relief index for expressing the city wide congestion relief impact of public transport in a generalised form. An examination of secondary evidence demonstrating changes in mode split associated with changes in public transport suggests that about one third of existing public transport users would contribute to additional car trips if public transport were removed. This includes all car drivers and half of the car passengers. A comparative assessment of international research valuing the congestion relief benefits of public transport reveals that congestion relief impacts are valued at between 4. 4 and 151. 4 Australian cents (2008 value) per marginal <b>vehicle-kilometre</b> of travel with an average of 45. 0 cents. Valuations are higher for circumstances with greater degrees of traffic congestion and also where both travel time and vehicle operating cost savings are considered. Experimental transport modelling analysis has been performed to understand the spatial distribution of congestion relief and the effects of different public transport modes. In addition, a new measure called the congestion relief index (CRI) has been developed for use as a comparative index of the congestion relief impact of public transport in cities. The proposed CRI integrates a number of different dimensions of city and transport characteristics into a single measure. The lessons learned from this study include (i) public transport plays a significant role in relieving road traffic congestion in cities; (ii) the wider significance of public transport in relieving congestion outside the central location of the metropolitan area challenges the traditional view that public transport and its impact on congestion is an issue only for central cities; (iii) public transport modes differ in their contribution to congestion relief, but the particular characteristics significantly influencing this impact include patronage, trip length, and spatial coverage; (iv) large-scale public transport systems in large cites provide significant high congestion reduction benefits in comparison to a small-scale systems in small cities; (v) the underlying dimensions of elements affecting the congestion relief impact of public transport in cities can be classified into three broad categories – (1) the public transport-oriented factor, (2) the car-deterrence factor, and (3) the urbanform factor; (vi) the car-deterrence factor has the strongest influence on public transport congestion relief, followed by the public transport-oriented factor and the urban-form factor; (vii) high congestion relief impacts are obtained in cities characterised by high public transport availability and patronage, high urban density and low car ownership and use...|$|E
