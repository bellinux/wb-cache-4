Among three different factors involved in the general queueing model (i. e. <b>variability</b> <b>factor,</b> utilization factor, and average process time), the <b>variability</b> <b>factor</b> was selected and investigated to see how variations affect the process cycle time under different conditions along with the batching effect. In order to determine the levels of factors, a set of RFI data was statistically analyzed.

Then, results of simulation were analyzed using the DOE in order to identify the most significant factor(s) which affects the current process cycle time. ...|$|E
40|$|Intra-individual {{variability}} in response {{time has been}} proposed as an important endophenotype for {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD). Here we asked whether intra-individual variability is predicted by common variation in catecholamine genes and whether it mediates the relationship between these gene variants and self-reported ADHD symptoms. A total of 402 non-clinical Australian adults of European descent completed a battery of five cognitive tasks and the Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scale. Exclusion criteria included the presence of major psychiatric or neurologic illnesses and substance dependency. A total of 21 subjects were excluded due to incomplete data or poor quality cognitive or genotyping data. The final sample comprised 381 subjects (201 males; mean age= 21. 2 years, s. d. = 5. 1 years). Principal components analysis on variability measures yielded two factors (response selection variability vs selective attention variability). Association of these factors with catecholamine gene variants was tested using single-step linear regressions, with multiple comparisons controlled using permutation analysis. The response selection <b>variability</b> <b>factor</b> was associated with two ADRA 2 A single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs 1800544, rs 602618), pcorrected= 0. 004, 0. 012, respectively, whereas the selective attention <b>variability</b> <b>factor</b> was associated with a TH SNP (rs 3842727), pcorrected= 0. 024. A bootstrapping analysis indicated that the response selection <b>variability</b> <b>factor</b> mediated the relationship between the ADRA 2 A SNP rs 1800544 and self-reported ADHD symptoms. Thus this study finds evidence that DNA variation in the ADRA 2 A gene may be causally related to ADHD-like behaviors, in part through its influence on intra-individual variability. Evidence was also found for a novel association between a TH gene variant and intra-individual variability...|$|E

40|$|In studies {{investigating}} {{the level of}} pesticide residues in edible commodities at harvest con-sequent to application of the pesticide, residues are normally not measured in single units but in composite samples consisting of several single units {{in order to obtain}} a more repre-sentative picture of the overall residue situation. Unless bulking and blending occurs before consumption (e. g. cereals), resulting in a homogeneous mixture of single units, risk assess-ment always needs to take into account that consumers may be exposed to one single unit with high residues. The most critical but still realistic scenario which can be imagined is the following: 1. the whole residue measured in the composite sample (e. g. 1 kg of apples) origi-nated from one single unit (e. g. one apple) only, while all other units in the composite sample contained no residues at all, and 2. this single “high-residue apple” is then consumed. To make sure that the dietary consumer risk is not underestimated by relying on residue data for composite samples, these residue data are multiplied by a <b>variability</b> <b>factor.</b> Usually the de-fault <b>variability</b> <b>factor</b> of 5 or 7, respectively, is used (depending on the unit weight). Based on empiric data from unit-to-unit variability studies with pesticides, in which single units were analyzed rather than composite samples, a couple of specific variability factors were derived. They were used in the context of registration and MRL setting procedures of pesticides. These specific variability factors were in most cases between 2 and 3 and replace the default <b>variability</b> <b>factor</b> for the respective pesticide/commodity combination.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Assessing liver {{fibrosis}} is traditionally performed by biopsy, an imperfect gold standard. Non-invasive techniques, liver stiffness measurements (LSM) and biomarkers [FibroTest(R) (FT) ], {{are widely used}} in countries where they are available. The aim was to identify factors associated with LSM accuracy using FT as a non-invasive endpoint and vice versa. METHODS: The proof of concept was taken using the manufacturers recommendations for excluding patients {{at high risk of}} false negative/positive. The hypothesis was that the concordance between LSM and FT, would be improved by excluding high-risk patients. Thereafter, the impact of potential <b>variability</b> <b>factors</b> was assessed by the same methods. Liver biopsy and independent endpoints were used to validate the results. RESULTS: Applying manufacturers' recommendations in 2, 004 patients increased the strength of concordance between LSM and FT (P< 0. 00001). Among the 1, 338 patients satisfying recommendations, the methodology identified a significant LSM operator effect (P = 0. 001) and the following <b>variability</b> <b>factors</b> (all P< 0. 01), related to LSM: male gender, older age, and NAFLD as a cause of liver disease.
