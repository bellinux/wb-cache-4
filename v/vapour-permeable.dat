50|$|For {{water to}} enter a wall first the water must get onto {{the wall and the}} wall must have openings. Water can then enter the wall by {{capillary}} action, gravity, momentum, and air pressure (wind). The rainscreen system provides for two lines of defense against the water intrusion into the walls: The rainscreen and a means to dissipate leakage often referred to as a channel.In a rainscreen the air gap allows the circulation of air on the moisture barrier. (These may or may not serve as a vapour barrier, which can be installed on the interior or exterior side of the insulation depending on the climate). This helps direct water away from the main exterior wall which in many climates is insulated. Keeping the insulation dry helps prevent problems such as mold formation and water leakage. The <b>vapour-permeable</b> air/weather barrier prevents water molecules from entering the insulated cavity but allows the passage of vapour, thus reducing the trapping of moisture within the main wall assembly.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} multiresistant Enterobacter cloacae {{outbreak}} in an intensive care unit, associated with mattresses and with antibacterial-treated and <b>vapour-permeable</b> polyurethane synthetic mattress covers of therapeutic beds. An {{increased risk of}} infection and pressure sores is associated with contaminated mattresses [1 - 6]. This is mostly due to disruption of {{the integrity of the}} mattress cover surface [7]. Antibacterial-treated and <b>vapour-permeable</b> polyurethane synthetic mattress covers have been developed to reduce bacterial and fungal colonisation of mattresses. These are currently widely used on therapeutic beds. These covers are considered easy to clean and to disinfect. We report an outbreak associated with recently developed therapeutic beds in an intensive care unit in which there appeared to be satisfactory nursing procedures and in which the mattress covers appeared to be visually intact. Our observations allow us to propose additional measures to the recommended maintenance procedure to avoid this type of hospital infection...|$|E
40|$|So far, the ideal-tight typical {{cross section}} is usually {{considered}} at {{the evaluation of}} constructions {{with the help of}} hygrothermal simulation. Usually always appearing additional humidification at lightweight construction elements, caused by convection, is not considered so that impermeable constructions seem, contrary to practice, more favourable than those that are more <b>vapour-permeable.</b> An unsteady model is now presented, based on flat consideration about fixed quantities to swell, which quantifies moisture ingress caused via convection subject to the real construction and basic conditions and thus allows situation-specific requirements for the air tightness of construction elements...|$|E
40|$|Background Central venous {{catheters}} (CVCs) facilitate venous access, {{allowing the}} intravenous administration of complex drug treatments, blood products and nutritional support, without the trauma associated with repeated venepuncture. However, CVCs {{are associated with}} a risk of infection. Some studies have indicated that the type of dressing used with them may affect the risk of infection. Gauze and tape, transparent polyurethane film dressings such as Tegadermnd Opsiteand highly <b>vapour-permeable</b> transparent polyurethane film dressings such as Opsite IV 3000 are the most common types of dressing used to secure CVCs. Currently, it is not clear which type of dressing is the most appropriate. Objectives To compare gauze and tape with transparent polyurethane CVC dressings in terms of catheter-related infection, catheter security, tolerance to dressing material and dressing condition in hospitalised adults and children.

40|$|Cold pitched roofs, {{with their}} form of {{construction}} situating insulation on a horizontal ceiling, are intrinsically vulnerable to condensation. This study reports the results derived from using a simulation package (Heat, Air and Moisture modelling tool, or HAM-Tools) {{to investigate the}} risk of condensation in cold pitched roofs in housing fitted with a <b>vapour-permeable</b> underlay (VPU) of known characteristics. In order to visualize {{the effect of the}} VPUs on moisture transfer, several scenarios were modelled, and compared with the results from a conventional bituminous felt with high resistance (200 MNs/g, Sd = 40 m). The results indicate that ventilation is essential in the roof to reduce condensation. However, a sensitivity analysis proved that reducing the overall tightness of the ceiling and using lower-resistance VPUs would help in controlling condensation formation in the roof. To a large extent, the proposed characteristic performance of the VPU as predicted by manufacturers and some researchers may only be realistic if gaps in the ceiling are sealed completely during construction, which may be practically difficult given current construction practice...|$|E
40|$|Cathodic {{protection}} is a proven technique to halt or minimise corrosion of steel {{embedded in concrete}} structures and bridges exposed to chloride from road dicing salt. Cathodic protection for reinforced concrete has generally been limited to impressed current systems due to the relatively high resistivity of concrete and reduced life of galvanic zinc anodes at high chloride content. Zinc rich paints (ZRP) are widely used as an anti-corrosion paint on steel substrates, an alternative to hot-dip galvanising. A type of <b>vapour-permeable</b> zinc-rich paint made of 96 % zinc has been proposed for cost effective and low maintenance impressed current cathodic protection of reinforced concrete structures. To evaluate its potential application in practice, the electrical, and electrochemical properties of the material have been investigated. The zinc-rich anode was found to shift {{the potential of the}} steel to more negative potentials successfully and satisfy the performance criteria in accordance with BS EN ISO 12696. In this research it is found that the optimum conductivity will be achieved by three coats to produce 280 - 320 m thickness {{in order to get a}} good current distribution in the surface of the anod...|$|E
40|$|An {{adjustable}} pump for microfluidics employing {{principles of}} osmoregulation analogous {{to those of}} phloem loading in plant leaves has been constructed and tested. Volume flow arises in a hollow fibre with <b>vapour-permeable</b> hydrophobic membrane. The fibre is connected to a source chamber filled with salt crystals and saturated salt solution. The source chamber takes up water through a relatively small membrane area and delivers saturated salt solution to {{one end of the}} capillary flow path within the hollow fibre. A stationary osmotic gradient is sustained in the hollow fibre lumen by constant input of saturated salt solution and radial osmotic water absorption. The strong temperature dependence of isothermal membrane distillation enables adjustment of the flow rate up to 20 nL/s. The pump provides pulse-free flow of any liquid with constant rate for at least 26 days without recharging the source chamber. Backpressures up to 1 bar decrease the flow rate by less than 4 %. The volume delivered at a constant rate is more than 40 times larger than the volume of the source chamber. Osmoregulatory pumps of the described type may be useful for microinfusion, microdialysis and analytical microsystems...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Experimental {{study of}} air-to-air heat/energy {{exchangers}} {{for use in}} Arctic housing Colin J. Beattie The thesis presents the experimental results of an air-to-air heat/energy exchanger (HEE), tested with four different cores, to assess the performance under Arctic climate conditions. Four per-formance indicators are presented: (i) the outlet supply air temperature; (ii) the exhaust air flow rate; (iii) the sensible and latent heat transfer effectiveness; and (iv) UV-value. The mass of ice formed within the core was also measured {{at the end of}} each experiment. The experiments are separated into three phases: Phase 1 with one HEE without recirculation defrost, Phase 2 with one HEE with recirculation defrost, and Phase 3 with two HEEs in parallel with alternating recir-culation defrost. Correlation−based models were developed that predict the change in heat transfer effectiveness in terms of the change in exhaust air mass flow rate, inlet supply air temperature and core type. The experiments with recirculation defrost proved that the factory-set defrost times are a conservative approach that manages the formation of frost. Because of the reduced operating time as controlled by the timer, all cores have almost the same sensible heat transfer effectiveness. The use of <b>vapour-permeable</b> cores reduced the rate of frost growth and the amount of frost at inlet supply air temperatures where core frosting was a concern. The rate of core frosting was dependant on the inlet supply air temperature. Frost formation impeded the transfer of heat between the two airstreams and reduced the adjusted sensible and latent heat transfer effectiveness for all cores. Recirculation defrost effectively managed the formation of frost in all tested exchanger cores for the duration of the tests at inlet supply air temperature down to − 35 °C. However, the use of recirculation defrost intermittently interrupts the supply of outdoor air resulting in reduced ventilation rates. The use of two heat/energy exchangers with alternating recirculation defrost adequately managed core frosting while providing a continuous supply of outdoor air...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{increased}} awareness of climate change and higher energy costs, well‐insulated buildings have become more common. Furthermore, the interests of using wood in building to produce more carbon dioxide‐efficient houses have increased. However, thicker thermal insulation in walls {{increases the risk of}} high relative humidity levels and the risk of mould‐related damage in Wood frame houses. In order to predict moisture damage {{it is important to have}} a properly verified, userfriendly and reliable calculation tool that can be used in the design phase. The first part of the thesis presents a blind method that can be used in order to verify heat and moisture calculation tools in a reliable manner. General results and findings from blind validations using a one‐dimensional transient heat and moisture calculation tool are summarized and presented. The comparisons include measurements and calculations of temperature and relative humidity and were carried out in Northern European climates. The thesis also presents important factors affecting the risk of mould growth in well‐insulated Wood frame walls. A parametric study is presented in which moisture‐critical positions in traditional Swedish wood frame designs in Northern European climates are investigated by using hygrothermal modeling. Traditional Swedish walls with insulation thicknesses of 220 mm are then compared to walls with thicker thermal insulation and alternative designs. In general the comparisons of measured and blindly calculated values show a good correlation. The results show that the studied tool can be used during the design phase to predict moisture risks. However, factors such as the influence of impaired temperature affecting the calculated RH have to be taken into account. There is also a need for developing outdoor climate boundary conditions that take into account critical periods and variations between different years. It has been found that there is a higher risk of moisture‐related damage in thicker insulated walls. However, this risk can be reduced by choosing more suitable designs in which well‐ventilated air gaps behind the claddings and exterior <b>vapour‐permeable</b> moisture proof thermal insulation boards are of great importance...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of skin environmental factors {{has been investigated}} in five studies. In the first study, the microbial growth and rash development in diaper dermatitis were studied in order to evaluate a UVB radiation therapy in comparison with a combined antifungal-hydrocortisone cream. The effect of reducing skin environmental pH in experimentally induced Candida lesions was investigated in the second study. The effect of occlusion on vulvar skin temperature, humidity and surface pH, with and {{without the use of}} panty liners was investigated in study III and IV, with study IV also including measurements of the skin microflora. In the fifth study, string panties equipped with string panty liners were compared with regular panties with standard panty liners, to evaluate whether there was any difference in their impact on the vulvar skin microenvironment. Diaper dermatitis was susceptible to treatment with UVB therapy, the improvement effect in this study was comparable to the use of antifungal-hydrocortisone cream. Experimentally induced skin reactions caused by C. albicans, were significantly reduced when skin environmental pH was changed from 5. 7 to 5. 1 (study II). The results were not caused by reduced growth of C. albicans, but might be due to a pH dependence of the virulence of the yeast and/or a modulation of the host s defence capability. The results in study III indicated that vapour-impermeable panty liners increased vulvar temperature, humidity and pH, compared with the use of no liners. However, the use of <b>vapour-permeable</b> (breathable) panty liners kept the microclimate basically at an undisturbed level. Study IV showed that vulvar microclimate and microflora levels were significantly higher during use of a non-breathable panty liner, compared to the use of no liner. The use of a breathable and acidic panty liner resulted in a microclimate and microflora close to the situation without panty liner. However, the numbers of microorganisms were low for all three circumstances (with or without the use of both panty liners) implying no significant microbial risk. The differences in panty and panty liner design in study V (string vs normal), seem to have negligible impact on the vulvar skin microclimate, skin surface pH and microflora. No support was found for the fear that a string panty system would result in higher contamination of vulvar skin with anorectal microflora. It is concluded that changes in skin environmental pH and occlusion are important for changes in skin microflora. A well-balanced skin microenvironment, with respect to temperature, humidity and pH, could be a good preventive approach to avoid skin infections and irritations...|$|E
