40|$|Objectives: Polymethylmethacrylate bone cements {{are widely}} used in {{orthopaedic}} and trauma surgery {{as well as in}} dentistry. The toxic side effects of inhaled methylmethacrylate (MMA) fumes generated during mixing have been well studied. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>cement</b> mixing systems have been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} airborne MMA significantly compared to handmixing. In an effort to further reduceMMA exposure, the latest generation of mixing devices are pre-packed with the ingredients and thus allow preparation in nearly closed circuits. Until now, there has been no study proofing the efficacy of those systems in protecting theatre staff from MMA vapours. Methods: A pre-packed vacuum mixing system (Optipac) was compared with two stan-dard systems (Palamix and Easymix) regardingMMA emission. The latter systems require loading with the bone cement compounds prior to mixing. Following a standardized proce-dure, 10 mixes were performed with each system and the emission of MMA vapours in the breathing zone was recorded using photoionization detection over a period of 3 min. Results: The mean MMA exposure was reduced when using the pre-packed system com-pared to the devices that require filling with the components. The highest emission peaks wer...|$|E

40|$|Nanocrystalline {{tungsten}} carbide has been obtained by reduction/carburization at low temperature from precursors obtained by freeze-drying of aqueous solutions. Nanocrystalline WC powders with a adequate content of carbon were mixed with submicrometric Cobalt powder (12 wt. %), obtained by same synthesis method, and sintered in <b>vacuum</b> furnace. The <b>cemented</b> carbides fabricated from experimental powders {{were compared with}} both commercial ultrafine and nanocrystalline WC- 12 Co mixtures consolidated by the same route. The synthesised powders were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, elemental analysis and scanning and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. On the other hand, density, microstructure, hardness and fracture toughness together with X-ray diffraction analysis of the sintered materials were evaluated. The cemented carbides obtained from synthesised powders exhibited a WC platelet-based homogeneous microstructure. This anisotropic growth {{might be due to}} the presence of stacking faults parallel to the basal plane in the starting WC powder, which would promote the defect-assisted preferential growth. These materials showed excellent mechanical properties, with a superior hardness/fracture toughness combination compared to materials prepared from commercial mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Background Techniques of {{cemented}} {{total hip arthroplasty}} {{have developed}} over time. We present the outcomes of Charnley total hip arthroplasty performed using improved second- and third-generation cementing techniques. Methods We reviewed the radiologic results of 91 Charnley total hip arthroplasties performed using secondand third-generation cementing techniques. Second-generation techniques involved making multiple anchor holes, a double-cementing method on the acetabular side and an intramedullary plug, and retrograde filling with a cement gun on the femoral side in 57 hips. Third-generation techniques involved additional <b>vacuum</b> mixing and <b>cement</b> pressurization in 34 hips. Results Joint survival rates at 20 years when using second-generation techniques were 89 % for the socket and 94 % for the stem with aseptic loosening as the end point; the survival rates at 10 years when using third-generation techniques were 97 and 100 %, respectively. According to our radiographic evaluation system for the clear zone at 5 years, there was less clear zone in the acetabular side with the third-generation techniques than with secondgeneration techniques. In the femoral side, {{there was very little}} development of the clear zone, but the difference between generations was not significant. Conclusions Second- and third-generation cementing techniques showed excellent survivorship. The clear zone scores at 5 years indicated that third-generation technique...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the risk factors for new symptomatic vertebral compression fractures after vertebroplasty at the thoracolumbar junction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 53 patients treated with per-cutaneous vertebroplasty at the thoracolumbar junction (T 12, L 1). The follow-up period was 15 – 27 months. The occurrence of new symptomatic vertebral compression fractures was recorded after vertebroplasty. We evaluated patient age and sex, amount of injected <b>cement,</b> <b>vacuum</b> clefts in the collapsed bodies, initial wedge angle of the compression fracture, change of the wedge angle after vertebroplasty, intradiskal cement leak, and percentage of height restoration of the vertebral body. In this report, we surveyed the possible risk factors for new symptomatic vertebral compression fractures. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (74 %) of the 53 patients had fluid and/or air in the compression fracture at the thoracolumbar junction (T 12, L 1). Eight (20. 5 %) of the 39 patients with vacuum clefts had new symptomatic compression fracture after vertebroplasty between 1 month and 4 days after surgery to 23 months and 4 days after surgery. The patients with new symptomatic compression fracture had higher initial wedge angle and wedge angle change (more than 7 °) after vertebroplasty than thos...|$|R
