The exhaust filtration systems employed for exhausting these <b>ventilated</b> <b>enclosures</b> did not provide promised collection efficiencies for removing engineered nanomaterials from furnace exhaust. The exterior hoods were found to be a challenge for controlling emissions from machining nanocomposites: the downdraft hood effectively contained and removed particles released from the manual cutting process, but using the canopy hood for powered cutting of nanocomposites created 15 %- 20 % higher ultrafine (< 500 nm) particle concentrations at the source and at the worker's breathing zone. The microscopy analysis showed that CNTs can only be found at production sources but not at the worker breathing zones during the tasks monitored.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a combined experimental, analytical and numerical modelling investigation into hydrogen jet fires in a passively <b>ventilated</b> <b>enclosure.</b> The work {{was funded by}} the EU Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking project Hyindoor. It is relevant to situations where hydrogen is stored or used indoors. In such situations passive ventilation can be used to prevent the formation of a flammable atmosphere following a release of hydrogen. Whilst a significant amount of work has been reported on unignited releases in passively ventilated enclosures and on outdoor hydrogen jet fires, very {{little is known about the}} behaviour of hydrogen jet fires in passively ventilated enclosures. This paper considers the effects of passive ventilation openings on the behaviour of hydrogen jet fires. A series of hydrogen jet fire experiments were carried out using a 31  m 3 passively <b>ventilated</b> <b>enclosure.</b> The test programme included subsonic and chocked flow releases with varying hydrogen release rates and vent configurations. In most of the tests the hydrogen release rate was sufficiently low and the vent area sufficiently large to lead to a well-ventilated jet fire. In a limited number of tests the vent area was reduced, allowing under-ventilated conditions to be investigated. The behaviour of a jet fire in a passively <b>ventilated</b> <b>enclosure</b> depends on the hydrogen release rate, the vent area and the thermal properties of the enclosure. An analytical model was used to quantify the relative importance of the hydrogen release rate and vent area, whilst the influence of the thermal properties of the enclosure were investigated using a CFD model. Overall, the results indicate that passive ventilation openings that are sufficiently large to safely ventilate an unignited release will tend to be large enough to prevent a jet fire from becoming under-ventilated...|$|E

Field studies were conducted at three sites to develop information about the effectiveness of control measures including process changes, a downflow room, a <b>ventilated</b> <b>enclosure,</b> and an enclosed reactor. Aerosol mass and number concentrations were measured during specific operations with a photometer and an electrical mobility particle sizer to provide concentration measurements across a broad range of sizes (from 5. 6 nm to 30). At site A, the dust exposure and during product harvesting was eliminated by implementing a wait time of 30 -min following process completion. And, the dust exposure attributed to process tank cleaning was reduced from 0. 7 to 0. 2 mg/m 3 by operating the available process ventilation during this task. At site B, a <b>ventilated</b> <b>enclosure</b> was used to control dust generated by the manual weigh-out and manipulation of powdered nanomaterials inside of a downflow room. Dust exposures were at room background (under 0. 04 mg/m 3 and 500 particles/cm 3) during these tasks however, manipulations conducted outside of the enclosure were correlated with a transient increase in concentration measured at the source. At site C, a digitally controlled reactor was used to produce aligned carbon nanotubes. This reactor was a closed system and the ventilation functioned as a redundant control measure. Process emissions were well controlled by this system with the exception of increased concentrations measured during the unloading of the product. However, this emission source could be easily controlled through increasing cabinet ventilation. The identification and adoption of effective control technologies is an important first step in reducing the risk associated with worker exposure to engineered nanoparticles.

The boundary conditions for the application of each of the above two methods are then specified. The mass transfer method may be used for the case of a heated plate and a jet at ambient temperature while the phase change paint method is applicable to a heated jet. Heat/mass transfer studies are carried out for two different geometries. First beneath a plane wall-jet- obstructed by a normal flat-plate (Alamdari, Hammond and Montazerin (1986 bound paper)), where the data are compared with the computations of the 'intermediate-level' convection model of Alamdari and Hammond (1982) and the high-level 'elliptic' finite domain flow model of Pun and Spalding (1977). The comparison has been a clear demonstration of the capabilities of the computer codes and has shown that although their results over flat surfaces are in good agreement with the test data, their predictions for jets flowing round corners need further research. Secondly the flow and heat transfer characteristics of a three-dimensional jet parallel to a flat plate has been studied.

The experimental prototype has the dimensions of 8. 33 m (length) x 2. 50 m (height) x 2. 46 m (width) and the cooled air is injected into the container through a half-width slot positioned at the centre of front surface {{and close to the}} ceiling. The prototype is positioned inside of a climatic test chamber having dimensions of 14 m (length) x 5 m (width) x 6. 5 m (height). The temperature and the relative humidity of the test chamber may be varied within limits of (- 20 °C and + 50 °C), and (5 % and 95 %) respectively. The air velocity at the slot exit is varied by changing the fan speed so that two different Reynolds numbers 4. 3 x 105 and 7. 86 x 105 are studied in the analysis. In experiments, the system at specified inside, outside and airflow conditions is approximately run for two hours to establish steady-state conditions. In recording data, the system data is divided into two groups: 1. The cooling unit data that includes refrigerant side volumetric flow rate, the pressure and temperature at the inlet and outlet of compressor, condenser and evaporator. Additionally, temperature and volumetric flow rate of air through the condenser, and the fuel consumption of the engine are also recorded. 2. The container data covers air velocity at the slot exit, and a total of 110 thermocouples measure the surface temperatures of all surfaces (inside and outside) of the container and local temperature variation of the airflow. Measurements carried out at both sides (air side and refrigerant side) to validate the data with an accuracy band ± 6. 5 % of the air side measurements.

Two turbulence closure models {{are included in the}} study, i. e., a low-Reynolds-number k–ɛ model, and the SST k–ω model. When looking at velocity fields, we find that the influence of turbulent length scales at the inlet boundary on the indoor flow field is small. The influence of turbulence intensity (ranging between 2 % and 30 %) is considerably larger, in particular affecting the separation point of the inlet jet along the top wall. When further investigating the effect of turbulent conditions at the inlet on pollutant dispersion for a hypothetical indoor contaminant release case, we find that variations of inlet turbulent length scales lead to differences in pollutant concentration of up to 20 %. Variations due to changes in inlet turbulent intensity lead to differences up to a factor 2. These findings strongly emphasize the importance of imposing realistic boundary conditions for turbulence models, refuting the common working hypothesis, often used in the indoor-ventilation literature, that varying these conditions has negligible impact on simulation results. status: publishe...|$|E

For the displacement flow scheme, thermal Nusselt and pollutant Sherwood numbers under different Reynolds numbers remain almost constant as the value of Gr/Re 2 decreases down to the regime of forced convection dominated. However, as Ar increases up to the regime of natural convection dominated, both Nu and Sh increase sharply with Ar (Gr/Re 2). Similar trends could be observed for the situation of mixing ventilated flow scheme. In the mixing scheme, non unique steady flow solutions could be observed for the range of transitional flow regime. Upward solutions, downward solutions and rest solutions have been exemplified with varying Gr/Re 2.

A novel mesh design strategy was introduced to design the LES mesh to identify an optimum 'well-resolved' mesh, assuming that the flow investigated is free-shear dominated. It was found that the URANS solution eventually settled down into a permanent steady state, displaying no evidence of continuing instabilities or periodic unsteadiness. Both URANS and LES solutions captured the existence of three steady states as observed in experimental studies. However, LES was more accurate in predicting the temperatures inside the enclosure compared to URANS. In the URANS solutions, it was observed that for smaller lower opening areas the average indoor temperature had noticeable discrepancies when compared with experimental results. Unlike URANS, LES correctly predicted different steady state temperatures for different opening areas and the time to reach steady state agreed closely with theoretical predictions...|$|E

This study mainly focuses on parametric investigation of ceiling-slot <b>ventilated</b> <b>enclosures</b> for determining the airflow and thermal characteristics. In the analyses, the container cross-sectional area is kept constant. However, the container length assumes values of 6. 13 m, 8. 33 m, and 13. 3 m, and the aspect ratio of the container varies accordingly. Besides, the effect of injection slot width on the flow distribution is also studied by taking two different slot widths at a particular aspect ratio. The air velocity at the slot exit is varied {{in such a way}} that the Reynolds number of injection is in the range of 20 and 2 x 10 ^ 5. The numerical analyses are carried out by using ANSYS-FLUENT software which is based on control volume approach. Reynolds Stress Model is applied for modeling the 3 D turbulent flow inside the enclosure. In discretization of convective terms, QUICK scheme is adopted, and SIMPLE algorithm is applied for solution of momentum and continuity equations. For evaluating the turbulent stresses near the wall, “log-law” function is used. In heat transfer analysis, for the top, lateral and rear surfaces of the container, the combine effect of solar radiation, convection and surface emission is simultaneously considered. In doing so, 3 D flow of air around the truck surface, and the related heat transfer problem is studied by generating thirty-two million of non-uniform grids around the truck. To capture the velocity, pressure and temperature gradients along the boundary layer, special type grids are generated in regions close to the solid surface. Convergence criteria for all flow and temperature parameters are taken to be 10 - 5. For flows with Re> 200, if the container aspect ratio is H/L< 0. 2, the flow separates from the upper surface of the container at a length ratio of z/L. ≈ 0. 85 Otherwise a cone-like vertical vortex occurs and causes uneven flow distribution in the container. The thermal performance of ventilation in the container is measured by a non-dimensional temperature distribution, θx at a particular cross-section. Generally, uniformity in temperature is provided at high Reynolds numbers. However, for 02 H/L. <, temperature disturbance takes place at the rare surface and can be avoided by full-size injection slot. dc 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{definition}} and governing equation of probability density function (PDF) {{have been implemented}} in the present work. The procedure {{is applied to the}} backward time identification of the pollutant probability density function history and finally the maximal probability density of airborne pollutant source location in a two-dimensional slot <b>ventilated</b> building <b>enclosure</b> contained with two solid blocks. Steady-state airflow field, sensor location, boundary conditions, thermo-physical properties and geometric characteristics should be known in prior. Spatial probability density function history has been computed under four ventilation modes, i. e., mixed ventilation (MV), displacement ventilation (DV), mixed ventilation with top ceiling outlet (MVS), and displacement ventilation with left side outlet (DVS). Effects of pollutant source location and alarming sensor on the accuracy of the probability density function have been disclosed. The pollutant sources will be more easily identified for the concentrated pollutant strips, where pollutant diffusion is efficient compared with the pollutant source at outlet. Particularly, the good agreement of the probability density function identified source location with the true situation fully shows that adjoint probability density function method is more competitive in the engineering applications involving with complicated convective fluid flows.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a re-analysis of internal pressure and building ventilation in a single-opening <b>enclosure</b> <b>ventilated</b> by winds. The dynamics of internal pressure {{is governed by}} a nonlinear oscillation equation. An alternative semi-nonlinear approach is proposed for obtaining the amplitude and phase shift of the periodic motion, the resonant frequency and resonant amplitude. Our new approach reproduced two of the commonly used existing linearization results. We also obtained explicit formulas for both the amplitude and phase shift of the internal pressure, {{as well as the}} airflow velocity through the opening. Numerical "accurate" solutions of the original governing equation were also obtained to evaluate our theoretical ones. We also found a quasi-periodic motion exists in addition to the periodic motion already found in the literature, but this has not been proved in any physical experiments. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
