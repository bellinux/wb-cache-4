Here, using the rabbit model, we show a correlation between limited heterologous protection and tprK diversity in the challenge inoculum.

Fourteen silent mutations occur among a collection of 36 hypermutated V(H) regions from two separate germinal centers of C 57 BL/ 6 mice stimulated with the hapten 4 -hydroxy- 3 -nitrophenyl. Matches to nine of these silent mutations can be found among published sequences of C 57 BL/ 6 V(H) regions of the J 558 family.

50|$|In an antibody, the Fab (fragment, antigen-binding) {{region is}} formed from the amino-terminal end {{of both the}} light and heavy chains of the {{immunoglobulin}} polypeptide. This region called V (variable) domain is composed of amino acid sequences that define each type of antibody and their binding affinity to an antigen. The combined sequence of variable light chain (VL) and variable heavy chain (VH) creates three hypervariable regions (HV1, HV2, and HV3). In VL these are roughly from residues 28 to 35, from 49 to 59, and from 92 to 103, respectively. HV3 is the most variable part. Thus these regions are the paratope, the binding site of antigen.

40|$|Abstract Background The gene {{encoding}} {{the envelope}} of lentiviruses exhibits a considerable plasticity, particularly the region which encodes the surface (SU) glycoprotein. Interestingly, mutations {{do not appear}} uniformly along the sequence of SU, but they are clustered in restricted areas, called variable (<b>V)</b> <b>regions,</b> which are interspersed with relatively more stable regions, called constant (C) regions. We look for specific signatures of C/V regions, using hidden Markov models constructed with SU sequences of the equine, human, small ruminant and simian lentiviruses. Results Our models yield clear and accurate delimitations of the C/V regions, when the test set and the training set were made up of sequences of the same lentivirus, but also when they were made up of sequences of different lentiviruses. Interestingly, the models predicted the different regions of lentiviruses such as the bovine and feline lentiviruses, not used in the training set. Models based on composite training sets produce accurate segmentations of sequences of all these lentiviruses. Conclusion Our results suggest that each C/V region has a specific statistical oligonucleotide composition, and that the C (respectively <b>V)</b> <b>regions</b> {{of one of these}} lentiviruses are statistically more similar to the C (respectively <b>V)</b> <b>regions</b> of the other lentiviruses, than to the <b>V</b> (respectively C) <b>regions</b> of the same lentivirus. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{capacity}} of a B cell to grow and to mature into Ig-secreting, plaqueforming cells (PFC) ~ depends on its mitogen reactivity, i. e. to possess a receptor for a B-cell mitogen (1). Mitogen receptors must be distinct from Ig molecules {{on the surface of}} B cells, but they may be functionally and structurally associated with each other (2, 3). Every third B cell in the spleen of 6 - to 8 -wk old C 3 H/Tif mice has been found (4) to be reactive to the B-cell mitogen bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (5, 6) and approximately every fourth to the B-cell mitogen lipoprotein (7).
