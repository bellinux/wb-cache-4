25|$|Physical {{properties}} of refractory metals, such as molybdenum, tantalum and tungsten, their strength, and high-temperature stability make them suitable material for hot metalworking applications and for <b>vacuum</b> <b>furnace</b> technology. Many special applications exploit these properties: for example, tungsten lamp filaments operate at temperatures up to 3073 K, and molybdenum furnace windings withstand to 2273 K.|$|E
500|$|The high {{melting point}} and {{oxidation}} resistance lead {{to the use of}} the metal in the production of <b>vacuum</b> <b>furnace</b> parts. Tantalum is extremely inert and is therefore formed into a variety of corrosion resistant parts, such as thermowells, valve bodies, and tantalum fasteners. Due to its high density, shaped charge and explosively formed penetrator liners have been constructed from tantalum. Tantalum greatly increases the armor penetration capabilities of a shaped charge due to its high density and {{high melting point}}. [...] It is also occasionally used in precious watches e.g. from Audemars Piguet, F.P. Journe, Hublot, Montblanc, Omega, and Panerai. Tantalum is also highly bioinert and is used as an orthopedic implant material. The high stiffness of tantalum makes it necessary to use it as highly porous foam or scaffold with lower stiffness for hip replacement implants to avoid stress shielding. Because tantalum is a non-ferrous, non-magnetic metal, these implants are considered to be acceptable for patients undergoing MRI procedures. The oxide is used to make special high refractive index glass for camera lenses.|$|E

50|$|In a vacuum, the {{electron}} beam provides {{a source of}} heat that can melt or modify any material. This source of heat or phase transformation is absolutely sterile due to the vacuum and scull of solidified metal around the cold copper crucible walls. This ensures that the purest materials can be produced and refined in electron-beam <b>vacuum</b> <b>furnaces.</b> Rare and refractory metals can be produced or refined in small-volume <b>vacuum</b> <b>furnaces.</b> For mass production of steels, large furnaces with capacity measured in metric tons and electron-beam power in megawatts exist in industrialized countries.|$|R

5000|$|Initially {{sub-assemblies}} of the interrupters were {{assembled and}} brazed {{together in a}} hydrogen atmosphere furnace. A tube connected to the interrupter interior was used to evacuate the interrupter with an external vacuum pump, while the interrupter was maintained at around 400 degreees Celsius. In later practice, since about the 1970s, sub components of the interrupter are assembled in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>furnace</b> by a [...] "one shot" [...] brazing and evacuation process. Tens or hundreds of bottles are processed in one batch, using a high <b>vacuum</b> <b>furnace</b> which heats the bottles to more than 800 C.|$|E

50|$|At {{temperatures}} below 1200 °C, a <b>vacuum</b> <b>furnace</b> {{is commonly}} used for the heat treatment of steel alloys.

25|$|These {{thermocouples}} {{are well}} suited for measuring extremely high temperatures. Typical uses are hydrogen and inert atmospheres, as well as <b>vacuum</b> <b>furnaces.</b> They are not used in oxidizing environments at high temperatures because of embrittlement.

50|$|In {{his book}} The Electric Furnace, Henri Moissan {{describes}} an early synthesis of strontium boride by mixing strontium borate, aluminum, and carbon in an electric furnace.

50|$|Some very {{interesting}} nanowires microstructures {{can be obtained}} by simply thermally evaporating solid materials. This technique can be carried out in a relatively simple setup composed of a dual-zone <b>vacuum</b> <b>furnace.</b> The hot end of the furnace contains the evaporating source material, while the evaporated particles are carrier downstream, (by way of a carrier gas) to the colder end of the furnace where they can absorb, nucleate, and grow on a desired substrate.|$|E
50|$|Another low {{temperature}} application of <b>vacuum</b> <b>furnaces</b> is debinding, {{a process for}} the removal of binders. Heat is applied under a vacuum in a sealed chamber, melting or vaporizing the binder from the aggregate. The binder is evacuated by the pumping system and collected or purged downstream.

Minor changes in the volume of samples at higher quenching temperatures compared to lower temperatures were observed...|$|R
50|$|Flame heating in {{a normal}} {{atmosphere}} causes oxidation, scaling and carbon build up on the parts. To clean the parts, applications of joint-weakening flux and expensive acid cleaning baths have traditionally been required. Batch <b>vacuum</b> <b>furnaces</b> solve these problems, but have significant limitations of their own because of their large size, poor efficiency and lack of quality control. Brazing with induction reduces both oxidation and costly cleaning requirements, especially when a rapid cool-down cycle is used.|$|R
50|$|Amorphous brazing foils are compositionally {{much more}} uniform even after crystallization, they melt over a narrow {{temperature}} range under transient heating. This {{is a consequence}} of the shorter distances over which atoms of different elements have to diffuse in order to form a uniform liquid phase. The resulting instant melting and their superior flow characteristic {{is only one of the}} important features of ABFs. The absence of the residual organic solvent bases evident in powder paste/tapes correspondingly eliminates soot formation and furnace fouling. The low level of gaseous impurities in ABFs, due to the specific characteristics of its production technology, is an attractive feature for <b>vacuum</b> <b>furnace</b> brazing.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>furnace</b> {{is a type}} of furnace {{in which}} the product in the furnace is {{surrounded}} by a vacuum during processing. The absence of air or other gases prevents oxidation, heat loss from the product through convection, and removes a source of contamination. This enables the furnace to heat materials (typically metals and ceramics) to temperatures as high as 3000 C [...] with select materials. Maximum furnace temperatures and vacuum levels depend on melting points and vapor pressures of heated materials. Vacuum furnaces are used to carry out processes such as annealing, brazing, sintering and heat treatment with high consistency and low contamination.|$|E
5000|$|A minimill is {{traditionally}} a secondary steel producer; however, Nucor (one of the world's largest steel producers), {{as well as}} one of its competitors, [...] Commercial Metals Company (CMC) use minimills exclusively. Usually it obtains most of its iron from scrap steel, recycled from used automobiles and equipment or byproducts of manufacturing. Direct reduced iron (DRI) is sometimes used with scrap, to help maintain desired chemistry of the steel, though usually DRI is too expensive to use as the primary raw steelmaking material. A typical mini-mill will have an electric arc furnace for scrap melting, a ladle furnace or <b>vacuum</b> <b>furnace</b> for precision control of chemistry, a strip or billet continuous caster for converting molten steel to solid form, a reheat furnace and a rolling mill.|$|E

50|$|The {{process of}} {{smelting}} metals {{in a vacuum}} is based on early development work carried out by Heraeus. The first <b>vacuum</b> <b>furnaces</b> came into use before the First World War. They were used to make alloys in the total absence of air. The first <b>vacuum</b> induction <b>furnace</b> was developed in 1917. Heraeus Vacuum Smelting started operations as an independent company in 1923, producing a variety of base metal alloys for use in electrics. The company owned 84 German patents between 1923 and 1933, resulting in 101 foreign registrations. Due to the increasingly high cost of investment and the different nature of {{this area of the}} business compared {{to the rest of the}} company, Heraeus sold its Vacuum Smelting business to Siemens (now SMS-MEVAC) in 1933. The Ruhrstahl-Heraeus process for vacuum degassing of steel was also a Heraeus innovation.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum {{furnaces}} is {{a relatively}} economical method of oxide prevention and is most often used to braze materials with very stable oxides (aluminum, titanium and zirconium) that cannot be brazed in atmosphere furnaces. Vacuum brazing is also used heavily with refractory materials and other exotic alloy combinations unsuited to atmosphere furnaces. Due {{to the absence of}} flux or a reducing atmosphere, the part cleanliness is critical when brazing in a vacuum. The three main types of <b>vacuum</b> <b>furnace</b> are: single-wall hot retort, double-walled hot retort, and cold-wall retort. Typical vacuum levels for brazing range from pressures of 1.3 to 0.13 pascals (10−2 to 10−3 Torr) to 0.00013 Pa (10−6 Torr) or lower. Vacuum furnaces are most commonly batch-type, and they are suited to medium and high production volumes.|$|E
