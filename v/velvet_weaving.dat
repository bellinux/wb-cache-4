Owing to many valuable studies on Ottoman and Italian velvets as well as Chinese and Byzantine velvets, we have learned the techniques and designs of velvet weaves, and how they were consumed. However, it is not well-known where and when velvets were started to be woven.

40|$|An {{overview}} of the mechanical properties of the core of woven sandwich-fabric panels is given. These materials provide {{a new type of}} sandwich structure with a high skin-core debonding resistance and the potential for cost-effective sandwich construction. The sandwich-fabric prc forms are produced by a large-scale textile weaving process (<b>velvet</b> <b>weaving).</b> The basic mechanical properties of the sandwich core (compression and shear) were evaluated and compared with those of other core materials. There is a large variety in possible core layouts and thus mechanical performance for sandwich-fabric panels. Acceptable mechanical properties for cores of higher thickness (higher than 10 mm) can be obtained by weaving part of the pile fibres in the core under angles of +/- 45 degrees, by creating networks of piles at lower degrees of stretching and sufficient pile density, or by filling the core with foam. There appears to be a strong synergistic effect between pile and foam properties in the sandwich core. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E

It allows relatively easy production of delamination-resistant sandwich panels, compared to more traditional sandwich structures with honeycomb or foam cores. In this paper, the 3 D sandwich fabrics made of glass fibre are impregnated with epoxy resin while the empty core can be foamed up with PUR to improve shear resistance of the panels. Core properties and static bending strength of the panels were evaluated. Three-point bending (3 PB) fatigue tests were performed on four different materials (two unfoamed epoxy panels and two PUR foamed epoxy panels) with varying static properties. After fatigue testing, the Wohler curves for each panel were determined. The relation between the observed damage development, the property degradation during bending fatigue and the static properties of the panels was investigated. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

50|$|<b>Velvet</b> is <b>woven</b> on {{a special}} loom that weaves two {{thicknesses}} of the material at the same time. The two pieces are then cut apart to create the pile effect, and the two lengths of fabric are wound on separate take-up rolls. This complicated process meant that velvet was expensive to make before industrial power looms became available, and well-made velvet remains a fairly costly fabric. Velvet is difficult to clean because of its pile, but modern dry cleaning methods make cleaning more feasible. Velvet pile is created by warp or vertical yarns and velveteen pile is created by weft or fill yarns.|$|R

Based on the crystalline structure of afwillite, it was chosen as representative of textiles of the early post-war period. During this era, Warner & Sons was still renowned for its high-quality silks and <b>velvets</b> - <b>weaving</b> the coronation robes for Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, as well as the Queensway Coronation Silk that was hung from the balcony of Westminster Abbey during the coronation ceremony. Warner & Sons also created many designs for the Ministry of Works destined for public spaces such as schools and polytechnics.|$|R
40|$|Velvet is {{a luxury}} cloth. Fashioned into garments, it dresses the elite. In interiors, it covers walls and upholsters furniture. Its sumptuous display denotes status, power, {{privilege}} and wealth. For the past twenty-eight years, my research and art has focused on learning its traditions and handweaving practice. Besides studying textile archives, I have more importantly visited the few remaining ateliers and have interviewed the artisans to learned about their training, methods and activities.

30|$|In this project, velvets are {{the subject}} of studies among those textile productions. <b>Velvet</b> is <b>woven</b> as {{supplemental}} warp loops on the foundation and the loops are usually later cut, resulting in the raised surface pile [22] page 80. It has a complex weaving structure and is woven by highly skilled weavers [23]. High quality velvets indicate that the culture has a high level of textile manufacture [24]. Weave structure, dyes and metal from metal threads were analyzed and compared from fifteen Persian velvets and six Indian velvets in MMA collections. Dyes were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with photo diode array detector. Analysis of metal of the metal-wrapped threads was performed using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. This was done in order to investigate whether the velvets from the two cultures could be attributed with certainty using these results along with historical and iconographical studies. In this paper, a part of such analysis of dyes and metal of metal threads is reported. The study involving more integrated results from weave structure and historical and iconographical studies is forthcoming.|$|R

40|$|Woven in Iran {{during the}} seventeenth century, the {{magnificent}} velvet {{that is the}} subject of this paper (figure 1) testifies to the splendor of the reign of the Safavid Shahs (1501 - 1722). A curious blending of Persian and European elements, it features four women holding various objects against the backdrop of a flowering landscape. The figures stand along the weft axis. The fragment in figure 1, from the collection of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York, features a full technical repeat unit, measuring over seven feet in warp direction, and 28 inches, or the full loom width, in weft direction. For Safavid silk weaving, this is an enormous technical repeat unit. The <b>velvet</b> is <b>woven</b> of silk; the numerous colors of the pile are formed by the labor intensive Persian technique of pile warp substitution. The background of the design is formed of gold wefts; the ponds along the lower selvedge, of silver wefts; and selected details are embellished by silver loops. Despite the European elements in the pattern, the technical details of its weave structure leave no doubt that this <b>velvet</b> was <b>woven</b> in Iran. 1 Its magnificence and extravagance suggest t,hat it was a court, and probably a royal, commission. This paper shall examine only one aspect of this velvet, the pattern, and discuss what might be its meaning. Even more narrowly, it will only examine those elements seeming to derive from European art. The Persian elements are of equal importance, but given the theme of this conference, textiles and trade, analysis will be limited to the European, hence alien, elements. Due largely due to the ambition and vision of Shah Abbas I (1587 - 1629), a new era in Persia 2 ̆ 7 s relations with the West began at the end of the sixteenth century. To bypass Ottoman control of overland routes to the West, Abbas I courted and rewarded the interests of the European trading companies, particularly the English and the Dutch. These commercial relationships were to have long-lasting repercussions for the Iranian economy and culture. 2 Persian art was changed irrevocably. Abbas I 2 ̆ 7 s xenophile tendencies, including relative tolerance towards Christians and a genuine interest in European art and culture, were to be characteristic of most of the later Safavid Shahs, particularly Abbas II (1642 - 1666). Although starting out slightly later than their English rival, the Dutch East India Company quickly made up for lost time. A national institution with vast resources, the Dutch East India Company overwhelmed all European rivals from the 1640 s through 1670 s. ...|$|R

40|$|Since 1986, I {{have been}} {{pursuing}} my passionate interest in handwoven velvet, both practically and academically. By velvet, I mean extra-warp pile, rather than weft-woven types of pile, such as weft-looping or knotting. Simple, monochrome plain <b>velvets</b> have been <b>woven</b> {{since the early}} Coptic period, requiring only simple looms and two simple warp tensioning systems, one for the foundation cloth and another for the pile warp. 1 (On the basis of such a simple set-up, early velvet figuration could be created through the following colour effects using: (a) striped pile warp; (b) ikat/chiné (spaced dyed) pile warp; (c) painted or printed pile warp; (d) 2 striped warps mounted counterchange style (e. g. DLDLDL/LDLDLD); or (e) 2 contrasting warps, motifs picked up by hand or held {{on a set of}} half-heddle rods. Simple textural effects include: (a) alternating stripes or bands of velvet (cut and/or uncut) and flat cloth; and (b) bands of differing heights of pile (cut or uncut). All of the above variations can be created using simple looms with as few as three or four shafts. 2 For example, the elaborate figuration of Uzbeki velvet ikats is provided by the ikat dyed patterning of the pile warp, which is then woven as a “solid” velvet, whose pile uniformly covers the whole fabric surface. 3 This <b>velvet</b> can be <b>woven</b> on a 4 shaft counter-balanced loom with both foundation warp and pile warp separately tensioned with “live” or gravity weighting provided by bags of bricks. Solid velvet pile warps can also be mounted on a single warp beam with uniform tension because all the pile warps are taken up identically. Examples of chequered patterning in silk velvets date back at least to the 11 th century. 4 Simple counterchange chequered designs can be woven with a minimum of two pile shafts and two pile warps, one of each of two contrasting colours. The two contrasting colours, let us say L 2 ̆ 6 D, can also be wound together as a pair and mounted as a single pile warp in which the two colours alternate. A 4 -shaft loom is sufficient for such patterns. To create the chequered pattern, the pile shafts 3 and 4 are ordered in blocks as follows: 3 rd shaft – LDLDLD… DLDLDL… 4 th shaft – DLDLDL… LDLDLD… Although the loom mounting for a chequered velvet is simple, the alternation of colours, although likely balanced over the whole piece, requires a separate tension for the ends on each of the two pile shafts. This is best facilitated by weighting the ends of each pile shaft separately on uniformly tensioned warp beams or with live weights. Without separate tension, a recurring build-up of slack pile ends will interfere with smooth weaving and an even pile height...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{components}} of colour reproduction of textured materials, are firstly, the accurate {{rendering of the}} appearance of texture [1], and secondly, the ability to print a surface topology that moves towards 2. 5 D texture printing [2]. The line of enquiry {{is based on the}} author’s interest in the relationship between the ‘direct manipulated’ mark [3] that is digitally generated (mouse, drawing tablet’s, iPads); compared to the analogue mark (produced by a brush, a charcoal smudge, an etched or hand drawn line) and its surface tactility or gonio characteristics [4], [5]; compared to its printed reproduction (for example an inkjet, electrostatic, four-colour separation). There is an emerging area for accurate rendering and synthetic application of texture, for example surface rendering in 2 D and 3 D CAD; and due to recent developments in novel materials and decorative printing inks, textures and embellishments are being incorporated to enhance the surface qualities of packaging. However, convincing naturalistic rendering and texture has proven to be more difficult. Where the human visual system is more forgiving in the perception of halftoned images, texture is problematic, as our visual system is able to discriminate the difference between natural and patterned texture. A natural texture appears homogeneous, but remains random - each element is similar but remains unique. However a patterned texture, although homogeneous is composed of the same repeatable and recognisable elements. Furthermore to render surfaces with no discernable pattern structure that comprises unlimited variations can result in large file sizes. As demonstrated in the recent art exhibition by painter, photographer and printmaker David Hockey at the Royal Academy, London (21 January - 9 April 2012) [6] comparing his paintings and drawings to his iPad works, the surface qualities of the inkjet prints from the iPad drawings were disappointing and devoid of surface characteristics. [URL] Whereas Hockney’s thickly applied paint onto canvas, the paint has a multi-dimensional quality, the varying translucency and opacity of the brush strokes can be seen, as can gloss and matte differential between oil on canvas and watercolour on paper. The difference between Hockney’s approach to drawing using paint on an iPad and drawing on paper can be loosely described as the difference between digital (graphical user interface, pixels, colour picker tools, vector, raster) and analogue (autographic, pigments, brushes, fluid dynamics, materials, texture) and the need to develop methods that are a verisimilitude of real materials [7]. The evolving question is, what are the elements of paintings produced by old masters that capture the qualities, texture, grain, reflection, translucency and absorption of a material, that through the application of coloured brush marks, were able to create a convincing likeness for the material qualities of wood, metal, glass and fabric? There is a difference here between the photoreal methods developed by artists working in the 20 th century who were interested in the creation of hyper-real images. These methods and paintings emulated photographic images and therefore artists attempted to remove any brush marks and surface characteristic to obtain a photoreal quality. However, the painters in the 16 th and 17 th century who were interested in creating a convincing representation of the attributes of a material, these paintings on close inspection demonstrate a gestural almost abstracted version of the material and surface. The paper suggests that in order to create both a convincing visual appearance, a high level of detail is not necessary, that too much information possibly hinders the appearance. It suggests that by using a more gestural approach, whereby the relationship of mark and colour, and by modulating the fluid dynamics of a mark through a textured surface, a more convincing rendering of texture can be achieved. Artists have been long aware of the psychological aspects of the juxtaposition of colour in exploiting the optical qualities and arranging visual effects in artworks. The artists, such as Velázquez, Goya, Holbein, Raphael, Raimondo de Madrazo, Gainsborough, Reynolds [8] demonstrated their mastery of texture by juxtaposing velvet with fur, satin alongside stiff silver embroidery. In order to better understand the convincingness of the visual appearance of texture, in this instance, the study has concentrated on the accurate rendering of garments. What material qualities were they able to convey to the viewer through the medium of paint, that a diverse range of materials - satin, silk, wool, <b>velvet,</b> <b>woven,</b> tapestry, brocade, metal could be demonstrated to the viewer.
