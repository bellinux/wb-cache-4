Although other industries have expanded rapidly in recent decades, agricultural production is still <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the state's economy, especially in rural areas. The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, corn (maize), soybeans, wheat, and hogs. Agriculture-related industries such as meat packing and ethanol production also have a considerable economic impact on the state.

5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń.

Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself.

5|$|Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the Imperial fleet from her commissioning in 1894 until 1900. She saw limited active duty during her service career with the German fleet due to the relatively peaceful nature of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a result, her career focused on training exercises and goodwill visits to foreign ports. These training maneuvers were nevertheless <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> developing German naval tactical doctrine in the two decades before World War I, especially {{under the direction of}} Alfred von Tirpitz. She, along with her three sisters, saw only one major overseas deployment, to China in 1900–01, during the Boxer Rebellion. The ship underwent a major modernization in 1904–05.|$|E
5|$|Paris was {{the central}} hub of culture and {{economic}} activity, and as such, the most highly skilled culinary craftsmen were to be found there. Markets in Paris such as Les Halles, la Mégisserie, those found along Rue Mouffetard, and similar smaller versions in other cities were <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the distribution of food. Those that gave French produce its characteristic identity were regulated by the guild system, which developed in the Middle Ages. In Paris, the guilds were regulated by city government {{as well as by}} the French crown. A guild restricted those in a given branch of the culinary industry to operate only within that field.|$|E
5|$|The vegetal diet of the Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} is high {{in fiber}} and only moderate in protein. Salt licks are <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the nutrition of the rhino. These licks can be small hot springs, seepages of salty water, or mud-volcanoes. The salt licks also serve an important social purpose for the rhinos—males visit the licks {{to pick up the}} scent of females in oestrus. Some Sumatran rhinos, however, live in areas where salt licks are not readily available, or the rhinos have not been observed using the licks. These rhinos may get their necessary mineral requirements by consuming plants rich in minerals.|$|E

Pilocarpine and cevimeline are sialogogues approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat low salivation caused by Sjogren's syndrome and may have the potential to effectively treat dry mouth caused by methamphetamine use.|$|E

These training maneuvers were nevertheless <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> developing German naval tactical doctrine in the two decades before World War I, especially under the direction of Alfred von Tirpitz. The ship saw her first major deployment in 1900, when she and her three sister ships were deployed to China to suppress the Boxer Rebellion. In the early 1900s, all four ships were heavily rebuilt. She was obsolete by the start of World War I and only served in a limited capacity, initially as a coastal defense ship. In December 1915, she was withdrawn from active service and converted into a barracks ship. Brandenburg was scrapped in Danzig, after the war, in 1920.|$|E

5|$|Germany invaded both Norway and Denmark on 9 April 1940. Norway was <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Germany for two reasons: firstly as a {{base for}} naval units to harass Allied {{shipping}} in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, and secondly to secure shipments of iron ore coming in from Sweden through the port of Narvik. During Operation Weserübung, Denmark fell in less than a day, becoming the briefest invasion in recorded military history. The Norwegians put up a stiffer resistance to the invading German forces. Nonetheless, by May the southern half of Norway was under German control. Following the German invasion of France and the Low Countries, the Allies were forced to evacuate Narvik, leaving the country to the Germans who would occupy it {{until the end of the}} war. After the invasion, Vidkun Quisling led the collaborationist government of Norway, based around the fascist Nasjonal Samling ("National Gathering") party.|$|E

One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E

He underwent surgery but remained healthy enough to start his new position as color analyst for the New Jersey Devils radio broadcasts. In 1987 Shero decided he wanted to experience coaching in Europe and spent one season coaching Tilburg Trappers in the Netherlands. With his health declining Shero returned to the Flyers' organization as a special assistant in 1989. The reunion was to help him with his medical costs, but it was also something that was <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Shero on a personal level, as it was a return to the organization he had the most success with. On March 22, 1990, Shero was elected into the Flyers' Hall of Fame. Eight months later on November 24, Shero died at Cooper Hospital in Camden, New Jersey. He was 65.|$|E

5|$|In April, Longstreet besieged Union {{forces in}} the city of Suffolk, Virginia, a minor operation, but one that was <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Lee's army, still {{stationed}} in war-devastated central Virginia. It enabled Confederate authorities to collect huge amounts of provisions that had been under Union control. However, this operation caused Longstreet and 15,000 men of the First Corps to be absent from the Battle of Chancellorsville in May. Despite Lee's brilliant victory at Chancellorsville, Longstreet once again came under criticism, claiming that he could have marched his men back from Suffolk in time to join Lee. However, from the Chancellorsville and Suffolk scenario, Longstreet brought forward the beginnings of a new Confederate strategy. These events proved that the Army of Northern Virginia could manage with fewer troops for periods of time, and units could be shifted to create windows of opportunity in other theaters. Longstreet advocated the first strategic movements to utilize rail, interior lines, and create temporary numerical advantages in Mississippi or Tennessee prior to Gettysburg.|$|E
5|$|Marisa Chase appears only in Uncharted: Golden Abyss. She is the {{granddaughter of}} an {{archeologist}} Vincent Perez.

She, just like Nate, got her climbing, knowledge of ancient artifacts and treasure hunting skills at age of 15. She has a problem trusting people who she doesn't know. When she calls someone her partner, that means that she trusts them. Her biggest difference to Elena is that she never uses a gun, even when she is getting shot at. She survived an RPG shot from Roberto Guerro during {{the events of the}} game. She finally decides to use a gun {{near the end of the}} game. She is voiced by Christine Lakin.|$|E
5|$|Modern humans coexisted with woolly mammoths {{during the}} Upper Palaeolithic {{period when the}} humans entered Europe from Africa between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago. Prior to this, Neanderthals had coexisted with mammoths during the Middle Palaeolithic, and already {{utilised}} mammoth bones for tool making and building materials. Woolly mammoths were <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> ice-age humans, and human survival may have depended on the mammoth in some areas. Evidence for such coexistence was not recognised until the 19th century. William Buckland published his discovery of the Red Lady of Paviland skeleton in 1823, which {{was found in a}} cave alongside woolly mammoth bones, but he mistakenly denied that these were contemporaries. In 1864, Édouard Lartet found an engraving of a woolly mammoth on a piece of mammoth ivory in the Abri de la Madeleine cave in Dordogne, France. The engraving was the first widely accepted evidence for the coexistence of humans with prehistoric extinct animals and is the first contemporary depiction of such a creature known to modern science.|$|E
