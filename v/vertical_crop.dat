40|$|This study {{investigated}} the crop density in a New Holland BB 960 (branch of CNH Global N. V.) large square baler as examined by crop trajectory from the precompression room to the bale chamber. This study also examined both {{the top and bottom}} plunger pressures and critical factors affecting the final top and bottom bale densities. The crop trajectories (wad of crop) were measured using a high-speed camera {{from the side of the}} baler through viewing windows. The viewing windows were divided into four regions for determining the crop displacement, velocity and acceleration. Crop strain was used to evaluate the potential change in density of the crop before being compressed by the plunger. Generally, the <b>vertical</b> <b>crop</b> strain was found to be higher in the top half of the bale compared to the bottom. Average strain values for side measurements were 12. 8 % for the top and 2. 1 % for the bottom. Plunger pressures were measured to compare peak pressures between the top and bottom halves of each compressed wad of crop, and to develop pressure profiles based on the plunger’s position. Results of comparing the mean peak plunger pressures between the top and bottom locations indicated the mean pressures were significantly higher at the top location with the exception of one particular setting. Resulting pressure profile graphs aided in qualitatively describing the compression process for both top and bottom locations. A stepwise regression model was developed to examine the difference in material quantity in the top half of the bale compared to the bottom, based on bale weights. The model indicated that flake setting, stuffer ratio and number of flakes had the greatest effect on maintaining consistent bale density by comparing top to bottom halves of each bale. The R 2 (coefficient of determination) value for the developed model was of 59. 9 %. The R 2 was low although could be accounted for due to the limited number of data points in the developed model...|$|E
40|$|Chlorophyll {{contents}} in vegetation {{depend on}} soil nitrogen availability and on crop nitrogen uptake, which are important management factors in arable farming. Crop nitrogen uptake is important, as nitrogen {{is needed for}} chlorophyll formation, which is important for photosynthesis, i. e. the conversion of absorbed radiance into plant biomass. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate leaf and canopy nitrogen contents by near and remote sensing observations and to link observations at leaf, plant and canopy level. A theoretical base is presented for scaling-up leaf optical properties to whole plants and crops, by linking different optical recording techniques at leaf, plant and canopy levels through the integration of vertical nitrogen distribution. Field data come from potato experiments in The Netherlands in 1997 and 1998, comprising two potato varieties: Eersteling and Bintje, receiving similar nitrogen treatments (0, 100, 200 and 300 kg N ha- 1) in varying application schemes to create differences in canopy nitrogen status during the growing season. Ten standard destructive field samplings were performed to follow leaf area index and crop dry weight evolution. Samples were analysed for inorganic nitrogen and total nitrogen contents. At sampling dates, spectral measurements were taken both at leaf level and at canopy level. At leaf level, an exponential relation between SPAD- 502 readings and leaf organic nitrogen contents with a high correlation factor of 0. 91 was found. At canopy level, an exponential relation between canopy organic nitrogen contents and red edge position (L rep, nm) derived from reflectance measurements was found with a good correlation of 0. 82. Spectral measurements (SPAD- 502) at leaf level of a few square mm were related to canopy reflectance measurements (CropScan-TM of approximately 0. 44 m 2. Statistical regression techniques were used to optimise theoretical vertical nitrogen profiles that allowed scaling-up leaf chlorophyll measurements to canopy nitrogen values. A nitrogen attenuation coefficient (kN) of 0. 41 g N m- 2 soil resulted in highest correlation coefficients for scaling-up nitrogen contents from leaf to canopy values. Remote sensing of canopy nitrogen (g N m- 2 soil) did not require considering vertical nitrogen profiles, as canopy reflectance measurements were able to integrate organic nitrogen over total canopy depth. The integration of near sensing techniques, theories on the interpretation of reflectance signatures and <b>vertical</b> <b>crop</b> nitrogen distribution allowed scaling between leaf chlorophyll measurements and canopy nitrogen values. This results in more accurate quantification of the nitrogen status of a potato crop, which is important information in potato crop managemen...|$|E

40|$|Commercial {{cultivation}} of greenhouse crops is today dominated by horizontal hydroponic cropping systems. But with greater demand for local food production, increased urbaniza-tion and expanding cities creates an interest of improved space utilization and crop optimi-zation per square meter. This study was initiated {{to investigate the}} possibility of vertical {{cultivation of}} lettuce. Two pilot cropping prototypes, P 1 and P 2, designed for vertical cul-tivation of lettuce were compared to define the potentials and limitations for commercial lettuce production. Results look promising and both P 1 and P 2 showed potential produc-tion of lettuce (Lactuca sativa, Lollo rosso, cv. fortress) with respect to canopy fresh weight. Lettuce with acceptable commercial size was produced. The results also showed that light intensity is the limiting factor in terms of crop size and to produce a uniform <b>crop</b> in <b>vertical</b> <b>cropping</b> systems. Conclusion is that both prototypes P 1 and P 2 are interesting candidates for cultivation of lettuce in <b>vertical</b> hydroponic <b>cropping</b> systems, but they need improvements regarding irrigation strategy and for a more even irradiation...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical stimuli or stress {{has been}} shown to induce {{characteristic}} morphogenic responses (thigmomorphogenesis) in a range of crop species. The typical mechanically stimulated phenotype is shorter and more compact than non-mechanically stimulated plants. This dwarfing effect can be employed to help conform crop plants to the constraints of spaceflight and <b>vertical</b> agriculture <b>crop</b> production systems. Capsicum annum (cv. California Wonder) plants were grown in controlled environment chambers and subjected to mechanical stimulation in the form of firm but gentle daily rubbing of internode tissue with a tightly wrapped cotton swab. Two studies were conducted, the first being a vegetative growth phase study in which plants were mechanically stimulated until anthesis. The second study carried the mechanical stimulation through to fruit set. The response during the vegetative growth experiment was consistent with other results in the literature, with a general reduction in all plant growth metrics and an increase in relative chlorophyll (SPAD) content under mechanical stimulation. In the fruiting phase study, only height and stem thickness differed from the control plants. Using the data from the fruiting study, a rudimentary calculation of volume use efficiency (VUE) improvements was conducted. Results suggest that VUE can be improved, particularly in terrestrial vertical agriculture systems that can take advantage of moderate height reductions by exploiting much greater vertical capacity in the production system. Mechanical stimulation can also improve VUE in spaceflight applications by reducing vertical system requirements or by expanding the species range that can be grown in a fixed production volume. Mechanical stimulation is also discussed as a microgravity countermeasure for crop plants...|$|R

40|$|A structural-functional {{model of}} a faba bean canopy has been {{developed}} based on Lindenmayer systems. The model was connected to an empirical growth model (Durand et al., 1999) that has been applied across species, to simulate the growth of vegetative organs. Parameterisation of such a model requires detailed information on morphological and phenological data and elongation dynamics (Birch et al., 2003). This information has been obtained from field experiments, applying specific techniques to capture crop topology and geometry. Other data sets were obtained for validation purposes. In faba bean, structural parameterisation valid for the entire plant may be drawn from a single stem (Ruiz-Ramos, 2003). Once the model was calibrated, validation was done on organ lengths, plant height and leaf area. The L-system formalism was able to capture the complex canopy architecture of an indeterminate crop as faba bean, generating a 3 D dynamic simulation of a nine-plant <b>crop.</b> <b>Vertical</b> and horizontal localisation of leaf area was reached.

40|$|Mathematical {{models of}} light {{attenuation}} and canopy photosynthesis suggest that crop photosynthesis increases by more uniform <b>vertical</b> irradiance within <b>crops.</b> This would result when a {{larger proportion of}} total irradiance is applied within canopies (interlighting) instead of from above (top lighting). These irradiance profiles can be generated by Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). We investigated the effects of interlighting with LEDs on light interception, on vertical gradients of leaf photosynthetic characteristics and on crop production and development of a greenhouse-grown Cucumis sativus'Samona' crop and analysed the interaction between them. Plants were grown in a greenhouse under low natural irradiance (winter) with supplemental irradiance of 221 micromol photosynthetic photon flux m(- 2) s(- 1) (20 h per day). In the interlighting treatment, LEDs (80 % Red, 20 % Blue) supplied 38 % of the supplemental irradiance within the canopy with 62 % as top lighting by High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) -lamps. The control was 100 % top lighting (HPS lamps). We measured horizontal and vertical light extinction as well as leaf photosynthetic characteristics at different leaf layers, and determined total plant production. Leaf mass per area and dry mass allocation to leaves were significantly greater but leaf appearance rate and plant length were smaller in the interlighting treatment. Although leaf photosynthetic characteristics were significantly increased in the lower leaf layers, interlighting did not increase total biomass or fruit production, partly because of a significantly reduced vertical and horizontal light interception caused by extreme leaf curling, likely because of the LED-light spectrum used, and partly because of the relatively low irradiances from abov...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the rapidly growing {{bioenergy}} production worldwide, there is lack of field experience and experimental data on the cultivation of bioenergy crops. This study aims to advance crop management operations and modelling studies by providing essential information on phenology, agronomy and crop physiology of three Mediterranean bioenergy crops: Helianthus annuus (sunflower), Hibiscus cannabinus (kenaf) and Cynara cardunculus (cynara). These crops cover {{a wide range of}} bio-industrial applications and fit into different cropping strategies. For these crops, we identified the most important knowledge gaps and performed a series of field experiments to fill some of those, particularly for cynara. Information on phenology and seed yield potential for cynara was missing mainly due to its complex inflorescence structure. This thesis codifies and describes cynara’s phenological growth stages according to the universal BBCH coding system. This scale can be used by everyone involved in the production of this crop under all circumstances. In addition, we present a robust allometric model for estimating seed yield under diverse management and environmental conditions. Inputs to the model are two easily quantifiable inflorescence traits: total weight and number of seed-bearing heads per unit area. Additionally, this thesis investigates factors at leaf, canopy and crop level that determine biomass production for all tested crops and provides key parameters for crop growth modelling. Leaf photosynthesis and respiration rates in response to light, temperature and leaf nitrogen were quantified. Based on such data, a biochemical model for C 3 leaf photosynthesis and an empirical model for respiration were parameterized and validated. Then, to upscale these rates from the leaf to the canopy level, light- and nitrogen extinction coefficients over time and in response to water availability were determined in detail. It was shown that the light extinction coefficient changes under water stress conditions and time of year, while leaf nitrogen only shows a strong <b>vertical</b> distribution within <b>crop</b> canopy during the mid-season. Relevant agronomic data, such as biomass production over time and leaf area index in response to management practices, are also presented for the three crops. This thesis contributes to the general objective of gaining more insight into bioenergy production from crop species. The findings can help farmers, researchers and modellers to better evaluate agricultural land uses and to improve biomass quantity and quality. Among the studied species, the perennial cynara shows the greatest potential for energy production in the Mediterranean region because {{a significant part of the}} production is achieved in the winter–spring period relying on natural rainfall.     Key words : cynara, kenaf, sunflower, phenology, agronomy, crop physiology, modelling, biomass production, crop growth, growth stages, BBCH code, seed yield, oil/seed ratio, leaf area index, leaf nitrogen, light and nitrogen extinction coefficients, photosynthesis, respiration, respiration acclimation, bioenergy, Greece, Mediterranean region.      ...|$|R
