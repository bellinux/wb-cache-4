5|$|On 8 November 2015, {{during the}} annual cyclone season, a low {{pressure}} area consolidated into a depression and slowly intensified into a deep depression before crossing the coast of Tamil Nadu near Puducherry the following day. Because of land interaction and high vertical wind shear, the system weakened into a well-marked {{low pressure area}} over north Tamil Nadu on 10 November. The system brought <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall over the coastal and the north interior districts of Tamil Nadu. On 15 November, well-marked low pressure area moved northwards along the Tamil Nadu coast, dropping huge amounts of rainfall over coastal Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh with 24‑hour totals peaking at 370mm in Ponneri. Chennai International Airport recorded 266mm of rainfall in 24 hours. On 28–29 November, another system developed and arrived over Tamil Nadu on 30 November, bringing additional rain and flooding. The system dropped 490mm of rainfall at Tambaram in 24 hours starting 8:30 am on 1 December. <b>Very</b> <b>heavy</b> rains led to flooding across the entire stretch of coast from Chennai to Cuddalore.|$|E

5|$|The Pacific coast {{features}} a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers {{because of the}} southeast seasonal wind.

5|$|There {{is every}} reason to believe that a very close {{formation}} of six Wellington aircraft will emerge from a long and heavy attack by enemy fighters with very few if any casualties to its own aircraft.

5|$|After {{a year of}} {{developmental}} testing of the B-29, Tibbets was assigned in March 1944 as director of operations of the 17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (<b>Very</b> <b>Heavy),</b> a B-29 training unit based at Grand Island Army Air Field, Nebraska, and commanded by Armstrong. Its role was to transition pilots to the B-29. Tibbets taught two Women Airforce Service Pilots, Dora Dougherty and Dorothea (Didi) Moorman, to fly the B-29 as demonstration pilots.|$|E

5|$|Darmstadtium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, because it {{is expected}} to have different electron charge densities from them. It should be a <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> metal with a density of around 34.8g/cm3. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from darmstadtium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough darmstadtium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|During the 1870s the {{distinction}} grew between 'first-class ironclads' or 'battleships' {{on the one}} hand, and 'cruising ironclads' designed for long-range work on the other. The demands on first-class ironclads for <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> armor and armament meant increasing displacement, which reduced speed under sail; and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly inconvenient. , launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881, was the last British battleship to carry masts, and these were widely seen as a mistake. The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships.|$|E
5|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry {{and devotion}} to duty whilst engaged in pack transport work near HOGGE {{on the night}} of 15 September 1917. Lieutenant DENNY showed great coolness and initiative throughout, especially when his convoy came under <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> barrage in the vicinity of CLAPHAM JUNCTION. Although wounded himself, Lieut. DENNY personally obtained assistance for two of his men who were wounded. He then reorganised his command and succeeded in reaching his destination. Lieut. DENNY after delivering this water then went to the dressing station where he dictated a report to D.H.Q. before being evacuated.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} in performance {{between the two}} were due to size. The RPG-2 used a custom designed 40 mm cartridge to provide much greater power, and the warhead enlarged to 80 mm. This improved penetration to 180 mm which allowed it to penetrate the frontal armor of all but <b>very</b> <b>heaviest</b> tanks, and the side and rear armor of any tank. The larger cartridge gave the PG-2 warhead slightly better practical range as well, about 150 m against stationary targets.|$|R

50|$|In this species, {{the largest}} extant lizard native to North America {{north of the}} Mexican border (non-natives like green iguanas are larger), snout-to-vent length is from 26 to 36 cm. The tail is about 20% of the body size and the largest {{specimens}} may reach 51 to 56 cm in total length. Body mass is typically {{in the range of}} 350 to 700 g, with 11 males having been found to average 468 g.

5|$|In 1947, a {{nationwide}} uprising against French colonial rule was initiated in Moramanga, {{a town in}} Bezanozano territory neighboring the Betsimisaraka. During the conflict, Betsimisaraka nationalists fought French and Senegalese soldiers in an unsuccessful attempt {{to regain control of}} the port at Tamatave, the island's most important trading port. Betsimisaraka fighters and civilians suffered <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> losses and some of the worst human rights abuses, including execution by being thrown alive from airplanes.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the five tropical systems, another storm was operationally believed to have existed in late August and early September. The ship Atlantic encountered a <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> gale while located west of Sable Island, Nova Scotia on August31. The storm moved rapidly east-northeastward offshore Atlantic Canada. It was last noted on September2 and was thought to have transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. However, HURDAT no longer includes this system in its database.|$|E
5|$|Joshua Humphreys' {{design was}} long on keel and narrow of beam (width) {{to allow for}} {{mounting}} <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> guns. The design incorporated a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme to limit hogging (warping); the ships were given extremely heavy planking. This gave the hull greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Humphreys developed his design after realizing that the fledgling United States Navy could not match the navies of the European states for size. He therefore designed his frigates {{to be able to}} overpower other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a ship of the line.|$|E
50|$|A tall barrel-chested man, Slezak {{possessed a}} large and {{attractive}} lyric-dramatic voice which enabled him to undertake all but the <b>very</b> <b>heaviest</b> Wagnerian parts such as Siegfried or Tristan. He had a distinctive tonal quality, too, which became markedly darker after his studies with de Reszke in 1908. Slezak was a master of mezza-voce singing and he could also deliver haunting head notes. Unfortunately, with time and hard use, his top register developed a strained and unsteady quality when used at full volume, as can be heard on some of his recordings.|$|R
