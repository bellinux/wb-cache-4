25|$|Furthermore, when a {{false belief}} {{involves}} a <b>value</b> <b>judgment,</b> {{it is only}} considered a delusion if it is so extreme that it cannot be, or never can be proven true. For example: a man claiming that he flew into the sun and flew back home. This {{would be considered a}} delusion, unless he were speaking figuratively, or if the belief had a cultural or religious source.|$|E
25|$|Multimodality {{also can}} be used to {{associate}} a text with a specific argumentative purpose, e.g., to state facts, make a definition, cause a <b>value</b> <b>judgment,</b> or make a policy decision. Jeanne Fahnestock and Marie Secor, professors at the University of Maryland and the Pennsylvania State University, labeled the fulfillment of these purposes stases. A text’s stasis can be altered by multimodality, especially when several mediums are juxtaposed to create an individualized experience or meaning. For example, an argument that mainly defines a concept is understood as arguing in the stasis of definition; however, it can also be assigned a stasis of value if the way the definition is delivered equips writers to evaluate a concept, or judge whether something is good or bad. If the text is interactive, the audience is facilitated to create their own meaning from the perspective the multimodal text provides. By emphasizing different stases through the use of different modes, writers are able to further engage their audience in creating comprehension.|$|E
40|$|Background: Although value {{issues are}} {{increasingly}} addressed in health technology assessment (HTA) reports, health technology assessment is still {{seen as a}} scientific endeavor and sometimes contrasted with <b>value</b> <b>judgments,</b> which are considered arbitrary and unscientific. This article aims at illustrating how numerous <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> are at play in the HTA process, and why {{it is important to}} acknowledge and address <b>value</b> <b>judgments.</b> 5 6 7 Methods: A panel of experts involved in HTA, including ethicists, scrutinized the HTA process with regard to implicit <b>value</b> <b>judgments.</b> It was analyzed whether these <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> undermine the accountability of HTA results. The final results were obtained after several rounds of deliberation. 8 9 Results: <b>Value</b> <b>judgments</b> are identified before the assessment when identifying and selecting health technologies to assess, and as part of assessment. They are at play in the selection of studies to include, and in deciding on how to frame, present, summarize or synthesize information in systematic reviews. Also, in economic analysis, <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> are ubiquitous. Addressing the ethical, legal, and social issues of a given health technology involves moral, legal, and social <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> by definition. So do the appraisal and the decision-making process. 10 11 12 13 Conclusions: HTA by and large is a process of <b>value</b> <b>judgments.</b> However, the preponderance of <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> does not render HTA biased or flawed. On the contrary they are basic elements of the HTA process. Acknowledging and explicitly addressing <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> may improve the accountability of HTA...|$|R
40|$|In {{assessing}} {{the appropriateness of}} a scientiªc community’s research effort, Solomon considers a number of “decision vectors, ” divided into the empirical and non-empirical. <b>Value</b> <b>judgments</b> get sorted as non-empirical vectors. By way of contrast, I introduce Anderson’s discussion of the evidential role of <b>value</b> <b>judgments.</b> Like Anderson, I argue that <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> are empirical in the relevant sense. I argue further that Solomon’s decision matrix needs to be reconceptualized: the distinction should not be between the empirical vs. non-empirical, but between the relevant vs. irrelevant. Whether particular <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> are relevant or not is an empirical question, to be decided on a case-by-case basis. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we test the {{usefulness}} of imprecise <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> in evaluating employee performance. The test is based on two experiments which evaluate the performance of college lecturers. The experiments are carried out by applying the PRIME model (Preference Ratios in Multi-attribute Evaluation), a specific multi-attribute value model that supports the use of imprecise <b>value</b> <b>judgments.</b> The test shows {{that the use of}} imprecise <b>value</b> <b>judgments,</b> as synthesized by the PRIME model, can remedy a number of defects that are identified in conventional evaluation models in regard to job requirements and employee performance...|$|R

2500|$|Evaluation-focused: An evaluative trait is {{one that}} {{involves}} a fundamental <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> about oneself, rather than a simple description ("I am confident and worthy," [...] vs. [...] "I am ambitious"). [...] Job satisfaction is itself an evaluation that people make about their jobs; therefore, an individuals' evaluations, especially those regarding how they think of and value themselves, should have a large effect on their job satisfaction.|$|E
50|$|The European Court of Human Rights {{stated that}} a careful {{distinction}} {{needed to be}} made between facts and value judgments/opinions. The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> is not susceptible of proof. The facts on which Lingens founded his <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> were not disputed; nor was his good faith. Since {{it was impossible to}} prove the truth of <b>value</b> <b>judgments,</b> the requirement of the relevant provisions of the Austrian criminal code was impossible of fulfilment and infringed article 10 of the Convention.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} Robbins’ famous {{definition}} of economics was of “economic science” which {{he saw as}} only a narrow branch {{of the field of}} economics. The field of economics included both economic science—which his definition dealt with, and political economy [...] which his essay did not deal with. His prescriptive message was that policy belonged in the “political economy” branch of economics. He believed that while the science of economics should avoid <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> as much as possible, the political economy (applied policy) branch of economics should, and must, include <b>value</b> <b>judgments.</b> That prescriptive message has been lost. : definition of economics, political economy, science of economics, Robbins, <b>value</b> <b>judgments...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Searle calls any <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> epistemically subjective. Thus, [...] "McKinley is {{prettier than}} Everest" [...] is [...] "epistemically subjective", whereas [...] "McKinley {{is higher than}} Everest" [...] is [...] "epistemically objective." [...] In other words, the latter {{statement}} is evaluable (in fact, falsifiable) by an understood ('background') criterion for mountain height, like 'the summit is so many meters above sea level'. No such criteria exist for prettiness.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1812, the Court {{had held}} {{that there were}} no common-law crimes in federal law. [...] See United States v. Hudson and Goodwin. [...] That is, the law {{required}} Congress, rather than the federal courts, to define federal crimes. [...] The Controlled Substances Act did not recognize a medical necessity exception. [...] Thus [...] "a medical necessity exception for marijuana is at odds with the terms of the Controlled Substances Act." [...] When it passed the Controlled Substances Act, Congress made a <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> that marijuana had [...] "no currently accepted medical use." [...] It was not the province of the Court to usurp this <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> made by the legislature. [...] Thus, it was wrong for the Ninth Circuit to hold that the Controlled Substances Act did contain a medical necessity defense. [...] It was also wrong for the Ninth Circuit to order the district court to fashion a more limited injunction that would take into account the fact that marijuana was necessary for certain people to obtain relief from symptoms of chronic illnesses.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{opponents of}} the childfree choice {{consider}} such a choice to be selfish. The rationale of this position is the assertion that raising children {{is a very important}} activity and so not engaging in this activity must therefore mean living one's life in service to one's self. The <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> behind this idea is that individuals should endeavor to make some kind of meaningful contribution to the world, but also {{that the best way to}} make such a contribution is to have children. [...] For some people, one or both of these assumptions may be true, but others prefer to direct their time, energy, and talents elsewhere, in many cases toward improving the world that today's children occupy (and that future generations will inherit).|$|E
5000|$|Economists {{commonly}} {{prefer to}} distinguish normative economics ("what ought to be" [...] in economic matters) from positive economics ("what is"). Many normative (<b>value)</b> <b>judgments,</b> however, are held conditionally, {{to be given}} up if facts or knowledge of facts changes, so that a change of values may be purely scientific. On the other hand, welfare economist Amartya Sen distinguishes basic (normative) judgments, which do not depend on such knowledge, from nonbasic judgments, which do. He finds it {{interesting to note that}} [...] "no judgments are demonstrably basic" [...] while some <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> may be shown to be nonbasic. This leaves open the possibility of fruitful scientific discussion of <b>value</b> <b>judgments.</b>|$|R

2500|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{discussion in the}} scientific literature on what policies might be effective in responding to climate change. Some scientific bodies have recommended specific policies to governments (refer to the later sections of the article). The natural and social sciences {{can play a role}} in informing an effective response to climate change. However, policy decisions may require value judgements. For example, the US National Research Council has commented:The question of whether there exists a [...] "safe" [...] level of concentration of greenhouse gases cannot be answered directly because it would require a <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> of what constitutes an acceptable risk to human welfare and ecosystems {{in various parts of the}} world, as well as a more quantitative assessment of the risks and costs associated with the various impacts of global warming. In general, however, risk increases with increases in both the rate and the magnitude of climate change.|$|E
50|$|A <b>value</b> <b>{{judgment}}</b> is {{a judgment}} of the rightness or wrongness of something or someone, or of the usefulness of something or someone, based on a comparison or other relativity. As a generalization, a <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> can refer to a judgment based upon {{a particular set of}} values or on a particular value system. A related meaning of <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> is an expedient evaluation based upon limited information at hand, an evaluation undertaken because a decision must be made on short notice. Value judgement is a fact which can be judged.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the concepts of}} istiṣlāḥ, munāsaba and maqāṣid aš-šarʿ in the thought of Abū Ḥāmid al-Ġazzālī (d. 1111 C. E.). Ġazzālī’s treatise on legal hermeneutics, the Kitāb al-Mustaṣfā, is the earliest extant source containing a systematic discussion of those concepts. In Ġazzālī’s hermeneutical system, the three concepts are closely interrelated: He uses them as a conceptual frame to discuss the role and scope of human <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> in determining God’s legal command. Ġazzālī claims that, in principle, it is legitimate for Man to draw on human notions {{of good and evil}} in order to interpret God’s legal revelation. However, Ġazzālī also establishes the epistemological limits of human <b>value</b> <b>judgments.</b> He discusses various hermeneutical operations that involve such <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> and carefully distinguishes between legitimate operations and others that – in Ġazzālī’s opinion – are methodologically unsound as they result in a mere projection of human <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> onto God’s legal command...|$|R

The results of the analyses also show how different actions become relevant in different practices. Furthermore, comparisons are made between the preschool practices and three teaching principles within education for sustainable development (ESD).

5000|$|Most {{commonly}} {{the term}} <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> {{refers to an}} individual's opinion. Of course, the individual's opinion is formed to a degree by their belief system, and the culture to which they belong. So {{a natural extension of}} the term <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> is to include declarations seen one way from one value system, but which may be seen differently from another. Conceptually this extension of definition is related both to the anthropological axiom [...] "cultural relativism" [...] (that is, that cultural meaning derives from a context) and to the term [...] "moral relativism" [...] (that is, that moral and ethical propositions are not universal truths, but stem from cultural context). A <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> formed within a specific value system may be parochial, and may be subject to dispute in a wider audience.|$|E
5000|$|As an example, {{scientific}} [...] "truths" [...] {{are considered}} objective, but are held tentatively, {{with the understanding}} that more careful evidence and/or wider experience might change matters.
