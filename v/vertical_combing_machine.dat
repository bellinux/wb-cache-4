40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the see-saw type RF MEMS switch {{based on a}} single crystalline silicon structure with narrow gap <b>vertical</b> <b>comb.</b> Low actuation voltage and high isolation are key features to be solved in electrostatic RF MEMS switch design. Since these parameters in conventional parallel plate RF MEMS switch designs are in trade-off relationship, both requirements cannot be met simultaneously. In the <b>vertical</b> <b>comb</b> design, however, the actuation voltage is independent of the vertical separation distance between the contact electrodes. Therefore, the large separation gap between contact electrodes is implemented to achieve high isolation.
