2500|$|By {{the method}} of [...] collection, VAT can be accounts-based or invoice-based. Under the invoice method of collection, each seller charges <b>VAT</b> <b>rate</b> on his output and passes the buyer a special invoice that {{indicates}} the amount of tax charged. Buyers who are subject to VAT on their own sales (output tax), consider the tax on the purchase invoices as input tax and can deduct the sum from their own VAT liability. The difference between output tax and input tax is paid to the government (or a refund is claimed, {{in the case of}} negative liability). Under the accounts based method, no such specific invoices are used. Instead, the tax is calculated on the value added, measured as a difference between revenues and allowable purchases. Most countries today use the invoice method, the only exception being Japan, which uses the accounts method.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two main}} methods of calculating VAT: the credit-invoice or invoice-based method, and the {{subtraction}} or accounts-based method. Using the credit-invoice method, sales transactions are taxed, with the customer informed of the VAT on the transaction, and businesses may receive a credit for VAT paid on input materials and services. The credit-invoice method is the most widely employed method, used by all national VATs except for Japan. Using the subtraction method, {{at the end of}} a reporting period, a business calculates the value of all taxable sales then subtracts the sum of all taxable purchases and the <b>VAT</b> <b>rate</b> is applied to the difference. The subtraction method VAT is currently only used by Japan, although subtraction method VATs, often using the name [...] "flat tax", have been part of many recent tax reform proposals by US politicians. With both methods, there are exceptions in the calculation method for certain goods and transactions, created for either pragmatic collection reasons or to counter tax fraud and evasion.|$|E
