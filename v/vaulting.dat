5|$|The {{complexity}} of the vault is another significant feature of English cathedrals. The vaults range from the simple quadripartite vault in the French manner at Chichester through increasingly elaborate forms including the multi-ribbed (“tierceron”) vault at Exeter, the similar vault with inter-connecting (“lierne”) ribs at Norwich, the still more elaborate variation at Winchester, the array of unique lierne vaults at Bristol, the net-like stellar <b>vaulting</b> of the choirs at Gloucester and York, the fan <b>vaulting</b> of the retro-choir at Peterborough, and the pendant <b>vaulting</b> of the choir at Oxford, where elaborate long stone bosses are suspended from the ceiling like lanterns. Many of the more elaborate forms are unique to England, with stellar <b>vaulting</b> also occurring in Spain and Germany.|$|E
5|$|Major {{restoration}} {{work was}} carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s, funded by the rector, Charles Kemble. The work included the installation of fan <b>vaulting</b> in the nave, which was not merely a fanciful aesthetic addition but a completion of the original design. Oliver King had arranged for the <b>vaulting</b> of the choir, to a design by William and Robert Vertue. There are clues in the stonework that King intended the <b>vaulting</b> to continue into the nave, but that this plan was abandoned, probably for reasons of cost. In addition a stone screen between the choir and nave was removed. Scott's work was completed by his pupil Thomas Graham Jackson in the 1890s including work on the west front.|$|E
5|$|The Usumacinta style {{developed}} in the hilly terrain of the Usumacinta drainage. Cities {{took advantage of the}} hillsides to support their major architecture, as at Palenque and Yaxchilan. Sites modified corbel <b>vaulting</b> to allow thinner walls and multiple access doors to temples. As in Petén, roof combs adorned principal structures. Palaces had multiple entrances that used post-and-lintel entrances rather than corbel <b>vaulting.</b> Many sites erected stelae, but Palenque instead developed finely sculpted panelling to decorate its buildings.|$|E

5000|$|A groin <b>vault</b> or groined <b>vault</b> (also {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a double barrel <b>vault</b> or cross <b>vault)</b> is produced by the intersection at right angles of two barrel <b>vaults.</b> The word [...] "groin" [...] refers to the edge between the intersecting <b>vaults.</b> Sometimes the arches of groin <b>vaults</b> are pointed instead of round. In comparison with a barrel <b>vault,</b> a groin <b>vault</b> provides good economies of material and labour. The thrust is concentrated along the groins or arrises (the four diagonal edges formed along the points where the barrel <b>vaults</b> intersect), so the <b>vault</b> need only be abutted at its four corners.|$|R
50|$|Note: On <b>vault,</b> {{the rankings}} are {{determined}} by the score of their first <b>vault,</b> the <b>vault</b> that counts toward their all-around total. Qualification into the <b>vault</b> final is based on the average of two <b>vaults.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} fan <b>vaulting</b> ceiling, originally {{installed by}} Robert and William Vertue, was restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott between 1864 and 1874. The fan <b>vaulting</b> provides structural stability by distributing {{the weight of}} the roof down ribs that transfer the force into the supporting columns via the flying buttresses.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} Bristol Cathedral is the <b>vaulting</b> of its various medieval spaces. The {{work that was}} carried out under Abbot Knowle is unique in this regard, with not one, but three unique vaults.|$|E

25|$|Ribbed <b>vaults</b> {{came into}} general {{use in the}} 12th century. In ribbed <b>vaults,</b> not only are there ribs {{spanning}} the <b>vaulted</b> area transversely, but each <b>vaulted</b> bay has diagonal ribs, following the same course as the groins in a groin <b>vault.</b> However, whereas in a groin <b>vault,</b> the <b>vault</b> itself is the structural member, in a ribbed <b>vault,</b> it is the ribs that are the structural members, and the spaces between them can be filled with lighter, non-structural material.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} a single-subject study on the top-elite vaulter in the world. This study was purposed to compare {{kinematic}} differences between Yang Hak-Seon <b>vault</b> (Yang- 1) and Tsukahara 1260 <b>vault</b> (Yang- 2) performed by Yang Hak-Seon. Fourteen high-speed cameras were used to capture a whole body segment motion of Yang- 2 <b>vault</b> during the practice session. Yang- 1 <b>vault</b> showed faster CM vertical velocity until the <b>vault</b> table takeoff and faster CM horizontal velocity prior to the <b>vault</b> table touchdown. However, the trunk rotation angle and its angular velocity of Yang- 2 <b>vault</b> exceeded Yang- 1 <b>vault</b> significantly. This {{might be due to}} a half turn off the springboard onto the <b>vault</b> table of Yang- 2 <b>vault,</b> which resulted in larger initial angular momentum at the <b>vault</b> table touchdown and further increase in angular velocity during the <b>vault</b> table contact...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Vault</b> Dweller {{explores the}} Cathedral of the Children {{and finds a}} {{prototype}} <b>Vault</b> beneath it where the Master commands his army. Disguised {{as one of the}} Children, the <b>Vault</b> Dweller infiltrates the <b>Vault</b> and destroys the Master. The <b>Vault</b> Dweller travels north to a military base, where the Master was using a mutagen called the Forced Evolutionary Virus to mutate humans into his Super Mutants. The <b>Vault</b> Dweller destroys the base, stopping the creation of more Super Mutants and splintering their army. The <b>Vault</b> Dweller returns to the <b>Vault</b> and is greeted at the entrance by the Overseer. The Overseer is happy that the <b>Vault's</b> safety is secured, but fears the <b>Vault</b> Dweller's adventure has changed them, and that hero worship of them in the <b>Vault</b> may encourage others to leave. For the greater good of the <b>Vault</b> and to preserve its isolation, the <b>Vault</b> Dweller is exiled into the Wasteland.|$|R
5|$|The {{technique}} of building lightweight domes with interlocking hollow ceramic tubes further developed in North Africa and Italy {{in the late}} 3rd and early 4th centuries. By the 4th century, the thin and lightweight tubed <b>vaulting</b> had become a <b>vaulting</b> technique in its own right, rather than simply serving as a permanent centering for concrete. It was used in early Christian buildings in Italy. Arranging these terracotta tubes in a continuous spiral created a dome that was not strong enough for very large spans, but required only minimal centering and formwork. The later dome of the Baptistry of Neon in Ravenna is an example.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} sport, {{the use of}} poles for <b>vaulting</b> {{distances}} was recorded in Fierljeppen contests in the Frisian area of Europe, and <b>vaulting</b> for height was seen at gymnastics competitions in Germany in the 1770s. One of the earliest recorded pole vault competitions was in Cumbria, England in 1843. The basic rules and technique of the event originated in the United States. The rules required that athletes do not move their hands along the pole and athletes began clearing the bar with their feet first and twisting so that the stomach faces the bar. Bamboo poles were introduced in the 20th century and a metal box in the runway for planting the pole became standard. Landing mattresses were introduced in the mid-20th century to protect the athletes who were clearing increasingly greater heights.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{centrally}} planned Early Christian church, Milan's San Lorenzo Maggiore, {{was built}} {{in the middle of the}} 4th century while that city served as the capital of the Western Empire and may have been domed with a light material, such as timber or cane. There are two theories about the shape of this dome: a Byzantine-style dome on spherical pendentives with a ring of windows similar to domes of the later Justinian era, or an octagonal cloister vault following Roman trends and like the <b>vaulting</b> over the site's contemporary chapel of Saint Aquiline, possibly built with <b>vaulting</b> tubes, pieces of which had been found in excavations. Although these tubes have been shown to date from a medieval reconstruction, there is evidence supporting the use of Roman concrete in the original. Fires in 1071 and 1075 damaged the building and the central covering collapsed in 1103. It was rebuilt with a Romanesque dome that lasted until 1573, when it collapsed and was replaced by the present structure. The original <b>vaulting</b> was concealed by a square drum externally rather than the octagon of today, which dates from the 16th century.|$|E
5000|$|Gymnasts (both {{male and}} female) show one <b>vault</b> in Qualification, Team Final, and All Around Final. If the gymnast wishes {{to qualify for}} <b>vault</b> {{apparatus}} finals, they must perform a second <b>vault</b> during qualifications. [...] In the Apparatus Finals gymnasts must also show two <b>vaults.</b> [...] For men, the two <b>vaults</b> must be from different element groups, while women must show two <b>vaults</b> with different repulsion from the <b>vault</b> table.|$|R
50|$|A burial <b>vault</b> {{encloses}} a casket on {{all four}} sides, the top, and the bottom. Modern burial <b>vaults</b> are lowered into the grave, and the casket lowered into the <b>vault.</b> A lid is then lowered to cover the casket and seal the <b>vault.</b> Modern burial <b>vaults</b> may be made of concrete, metal, or plastic. Because {{the sides of the}} burial <b>vault</b> are attached {{to the bottom of the}} <b>vault,</b> the burial <b>vault</b> is generally stronger than a burial liner. Some burial <b>vaults</b> reverse the construction, so that only a base is placed beneath the coffin. The lid consists of the four sides and the top. These types of burial <b>vaults</b> allow a better seal between the lid and base.|$|R
50|$|In architecture, a cloister <b>vault</b> or domical <b>vault</b> is a <b>vault</b> {{with four}} concave {{surfaces}} (patches of cylinders) meeting {{at a point}} above {{the center of the}} <b>vault.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{new church}} {{is not a}} typical example of the Perpendicular form of Gothic architecture; the low aisles and nave arcades and the very tall {{clerestory}} present the opposite balance to that which was usual in perpendicular churches. As this building was {{to serve as a}} monastic church, it was built to a cruciform plan, which had become relatively rare in parish churches of the time. The interior contains fine fan <b>vaulting</b> by Robert and William Vertue, who designed similar <b>vaulting</b> for the Henry VII chapel, at Westminster Abbey. The building has 52 windows, occupying about 80% of the wall space, giving the interior an impression of lightness, and reflecting the different attitudes towards churchmanship shown by the clergy of the time and those of the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Book XVIII {{covers the}} terms of war, games and jurisprudence. Isidore {{describes}} standards, trumpets, weapons including swords, spears, arrows, slings, battering rams, and armour including shields, breastplates and helmets. Athletic games include running and jumping, throwing and wrestling. Circus games are described, with chariot racing, horse racing and <b>vaulting.</b> In the theatre, comedy, tragedy, mime and dance are covered. In the amphitheatre, Isidore covers those who fight with nets, nooses and other weapons.|$|E
5|$|Born 5 August 1958 in Oberhausen as Ulla Helbing, Salzgeber began riding at age 10, {{competing}} in the sport of <b>vaulting.</b> In 1977, at age 19, she was the Young Riders European Championships. She attended college, graduating from law school before building a training stable in Bad Worishofen, Germany, that focuses on dressage. Salzgeber is married to Sebastian Salzgeber, and has one daughter, Kim.|$|E
50|$|The Tuscan <b>Vault</b> {{once held}} {{many more than}} the present 14 tombs, but most were moved to the New <b>Vault</b> or {{enclosed}} within the piers of the Ferdinand <b>Vault</b> during the major rearrangement of 1960. The 5-meter wide <b>vault</b> is very large, being 21 meters long, and extends along the entire western lengths of both the Ferdinand <b>Vault</b> and the Franz <b>Vault,</b> ending only when it meets the outside wall of the west transept of the Maria Theresia <b>Vault.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{township}} is {{also home}} to a few cemetery <b>vaults,</b> 4 of which still stand. Also known as dead houses, these stone <b>vaults</b> were used to store bodies in cold-climate areas until the ground could be excavated for burial. The Shanly cemetery <b>vault</b> is located in close proximity to the hamlet's cemetery. This <b>vault</b> is in poor condition but still stands; it is estimated to have been built around 1876, the same time the Shanly cemetery was erected. There are two <b>vaults</b> located in Spencerville, the Spencerville Funeral Home <b>vault</b> and the Connell <b>vault.</b> The Connell <b>vault</b> is located just outside the village, on the Connell family's property. It was built in 1912 as a private family <b>vault</b> and remains a private structure today. The Spencerville Funeral Home <b>vault</b> is located on County Road 44 just south of the village. The <b>vault</b> was built in 1892, and according to The Prescott Journal in an article published August, 24th 1893, the <b>vault</b> was built at a cost of $600 and had every modern convenience of the time in regards to <b>vaults.</b> As of 2008, the <b>vault</b> was owned by the Grant Brown Funeral Home of Spencerville and was still in use. St. Paul's Cemetery <b>vault</b> is located within St. Paul's Cemetery on the outskirts of Cardinal. It is believed this <b>vault</b> was built using stones salvaged from the St. Paul's Anglican church when it was dismantled in 1872. This <b>vault</b> was still in use as of 2008.|$|R
5|$|Further {{development}} {{included the}} repetition of Curvilinear or flame-like forms that occur in {{a great number of}} windows of around 1320, notably in the retro-choir at Wells and the nave of Exeter Cathedral. This type of tracery is often seen in combination with <b>vaulting</b> ribs of extreme projection and very rich moulding, as is seen in the chapter house at Wells, and the vault at Exeter, which stretches, uninterrupted by a central tower, for 91 metres (300ft) and is the longest medieval vault in the world.|$|E
5|$|Haflingers {{have many}} uses {{including}} light draft, harness work and various under-saddle disciplines such as endurance riding, dressage, equestrian <b>vaulting</b> and therapeutic riding. They are also still {{used by the}} Austrian and German armies for work in rough terrain. The World Haflinger Federation (WHF), the international governing body that controls breed standards for the Haflinger, {{is made up of}} a confederation of 22nationalregistries, and helps set breeding objectives, guidelines and rules for its member organizations.|$|E
5|$|In 1621, a {{subcommittee}} of the House of Lords concluded that the Lords' record keeping should be improved, and the tower was renovated to improve its storage facilities. The {{first floor of the}} tower, used to store the documents, was renovated with brick <b>vaulting,</b> providing better fire protection than the original wooden ceiling, by Thomas Hicks at a cost of £6. The chamber was further protected by a new iron door.|$|E
50|$|A {{large number}} of the stones contain masonic symbols, {{as well as a}} number of carved tree-stumps.

5|$|In {{the past}} Mérens horses {{were used for}} farm work, {{particularly}} on steep or difficult terrain, as packhorses and for draft work in mining or hauling timber or sledges. Today, following breeding selection towards a slightly taller and livelier type, they are used principally as saddle horses, especially for trekking in mountainous areas; but have also proved successful in carriage driving. Some {{have been used for}} <b>vaulting,</b> dressage, show jumping and three-day eventing.|$|E

He had confined his efforts to jumps, hurdles and shot-puts, but now added pole <b>vaulting,</b> javelin, discus, hammer and 56lb weight. In the Olympic trials held at Celtic Park in New York, his all-round ability stood out in all these events and so he riveted a claim to {{a place on the}} team that went to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The abbey is a Grade I listed building, {{particularly}} {{noted for}} its fan <b>vaulting.</b> It contains war memorials for the local population and monuments to several notable people, {{in the form of}} wall and floor plaques and commemorative stained glass.

50|$|It can {{be thought}} of as formed by two barrel <b>vaults</b> that cross at right angles to each other: the open space within the <b>vault</b> is the {{intersection}} of the space within the two barrel <b>vaults,</b> and the solid material that surrounds the <b>vault</b> is the union of the solid material surrounding the two barrel vaults.In this way it differs from a groin <b>vault,</b> which is also formed from two barrel <b>vaults</b> but in the opposite way: in a groin <b>vault,</b> the space is the union of the spaces of two barrel <b>vaults,</b> and the solid material is the intersection.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Vault</b> Dweller {{travels to}} <b>Vault</b> 15, the closest known <b>Vault</b> {{that may be}} able to provide help, but finds it {{collapsed}} into ruins and abandoned. The survivors of <b>Vault</b> 15 have founded a town named Shady Sands, and the <b>Vault</b> Dweller is given the option to defend them from the Khans, a group of raiders that attack the town, and radscorpions, mutated scorpions that plague the town's herds. The <b>Vault</b> Dweller then travels south to Junktown, where they can help the mayor, Killian Darkwater, bring the corrupt casino head Gizmo to justice, or help Gizmo assassinate Killian to take over the town. Further south the <b>Vault</b> Dweller finds The Hub, a bustling merchant city, where the <b>Vault</b> Dweller has the option to hire water caravans to aid <b>Vault</b> 13 and extend their estimated survival by 100 days. With clues from the Hub, the <b>Vault</b> Dweller travels to Necropolis, a city of mutated humans called ghouls. Under the city the <b>Vault</b> Dweller finds <b>Vault</b> 12 and recovers a water chip.|$|R
40|$|The <b>vault</b> {{complex is}} the largest {{cellular}} ribonucleoprotein complex ever characterized and is present across diverse Eukarya. Despite significant information regarding the structure, composition and evolutionary conservation of the <b>vault,</b> little is know about the complex’s actual biological function. To determine if intracellular <b>vaults</b> are morphologically similar to previously studied purified and recombinant <b>vaults,</b> we have used electron cryo-tomography to characterize the <b>vault</b> complexes found in the thin edges of primary human cells growing in tissue culture. Our studies confirm that intracellular <b>vaults</b> are similar in overall size and shape to purified and recombinant <b>vaults</b> previously analyzed. Results from subtomogram averaging indicate that densities within the <b>vault</b> lumen are not ordered, but randomly distributed. We also observe that <b>vaults</b> located in the extreme periphery of the cytoplasm predominately associate with granule-like structures and actin. Our ultrastructure studies augment existing biochemical, structural and genetic information on the <b>vault,</b> and provide important intracellular context for the ongoing efforts to understand the biological function of the native cytoplasmic <b>vault...</b>|$|R
