Recent studies have showed, however, an important variability between devices regarding reliability of data provided. In this study, we aimed to compare apnea-hypopnea indices (AHI) provided by home ventilators (AHINIV) versus data scored manually during polysomnography (AHIPSG) in subjects on noninvasive ventilation (NIV) for obesity-hypoventilation syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Positive {{pressure}} non-invasive ventilation (NIV) {{has been}} available {{for the treatment of}} chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure since the first publications by Sullivan et al, Delaubier, and Rideau in the early 1980 ’s. NIV was performed initially with volume-cycled ventilators, until the advent of bi-level pressure cycled ventilators, in the late 80 ’s, which were less cumbersome, cheaper, and in most cases perceived as more comfortable by users. The number of patients treated by NIV increased very regularly during the 1990 ’s, with a progressive shift in indications. As {{of the end of the}} 1990 ’s, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obesity-hypoventilation were clearly the most frequent indications for NIV. With the advent of bi-level pressure cycled ventilators, major changes occurred in ventilators, interfaces and monitoring techniques available. Adjustable inspiratory and expiratory triggers, adjustable rate of pressurization, built-in monitoring software and volume targeting are options currently available on many pressure cycled <b>ventilators</b> designed <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care.</b> Initially, the aim of long term NIV was mainly to improve daytime arterial blood gases (mainly to correct PaCO 2) and to improve nocturnal oxygen saturation (SaO 2). The advent and validation of transcutaneous capnography showed however that monitoring of nocturnal PtcCO 2 was necessary to ensure an optimal control of nocturnal hypoventilation: indeed, re-setting of respiratory centres through correction of nocturnal PaCO 2 is probably the major physiologic explanation for the efficacy of home NIV. Also, although leaks through nasal interface were to some degree inevitable, it was shown that major leaks cause micro-arousals and disrupt patients’ sleep and conversely, that correction of mouth leaks was associated with improved sleep structure. More recently, an observational study in patients with obesity-hypoventilation treated by long term NIV showed that, in spite of satisfactory correction of nocturnal PtcCO 2 and SaO 2, major respiratory events could occur, often undetected by the patient, but leading to a decrease in sleep efficiency, an increase in micro-arousals and sleep disruption. Patient-ventilator asynchrony, auto-triggering, ventilator-induced periodic breathing, and of course, leaks were the major events identified. Actually, up to 55 % of chronic stable patients under NIV had significant periods of patient-ventilator asynchrony, and 40 % had periodic breathing. In a recent study, we showed that new options proposed on recent bi-level pressure cycled ventilators such as volume targeting could lead to detrimental changes in sleep structure, even if they did improve nocturnal PtcCO 2. The present study explores four different aspects of the patient-ventilator relationship during sleep and its monitoring. First, we evaluated the impact of NIV on sleep structure assessed by polysomnography (PSG) and arterial blood gases (ABG) in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure: this aspect has received little attention in the medical literature. Surprisingly, very little recommendations detail how ventilators should be adjusted <b>for</b> long term <b>home</b> <b>care.</b> Therefore, we chose – in the second part of this study - to explore how the modification of one ventilator setting (back-up respiratory frequency) could affect quality of sleep and occurrence of respiratory events. In other words, we aimed to determine whether it is better, in terms of efficacy and patient-ventilator synchronisation, to use an “S” mode (spontaneous), an “ST” (Spontaneous/Timed mode) with an intermediate back-up rate, slightly below that of the patient, or a T mode, with a ventilator respiratory rate above that of the patient. This issue has to our knowledge only been marginally studied without any consensus. Thirdly, as previously mentioned, recent <b>ventilators</b> designed <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> have built-in softwares which provide potentially useful information for the clinician in terms of monitoring NIV at home. Clinicians need to know if values of tidal volume, leaks, or apnea-hypopnea index recorded by built-in software are reliable and can be used as recommended by AASM. These items however have not been independently validated, and we will show that there is large variability in the reliability of the results made available for the clinician. Finally, when exploring the many difficulties in analysing polygraphic and PSG data obtained in patients under NIV, we found that one major difficulty was to determine whether decreases in flow were associated with a decrease in ventilatory drive (i. e. central events) or not: a non-invasive monitoring of respiratory effort could be an attractive tool to evaluate the respiratory effort of the patient. We chose to determine whether Pulse Transit Time could be used as a surrogate marker of inspiratory effort under NIV. (MED 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} my {{bachelor}} thesis is ``The issues of hospice care {{from the viewpoint}} of nurses working <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies and potential patients``. The following two objectives and three hypotheses were formulated for the thesis: The first goal was to map the situation in provision of <b>home</b> hospice <b>care</b> {{from the viewpoint of}} nurses working <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies. Two hypotheses were formulated for this objective. H 1 - Nurses working <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies provide <b>home</b> hospice <b>care</b> and H 2 - Nurses working <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies are interested in expanding the <b>home</b> hospice <b>care</b> by means of mobile hospice units. The second objective of the bachelor thesis was to survey awareness of the lay public about the provision of hospice <b>care</b> by <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies. <b>For</b> this objective the third and the last hypothesis H 3 was formulated { [...] } The lay public has no information about the provision of hospice <b>care</b> by <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies. A quantitative research method has been used to achieve the objective, using inquiring with questionnaires. Two types of questionnaires were used, one for nurses working <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies and one for the lay public. The resulting data have been processed with a descriptive statistical method. The first surveyed group consisted of 57 nurses and the second surveyed group consisted of 75 respondents. We have found out that nurses working <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies provide <b>home</b> hospice <b>care</b> but they are often unable to ensure quality conditions <b>for</b> such <b>home</b> hospice <b>care.</b> Another surprising finding was that the nurses working <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies were not interested in extending the <b>home</b> hospice <b>care</b> with mobile hospice units. We believe that the nurses working <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies lack the necessary information about the <b>home</b> hospice <b>care.</b> The hypothesis No. 1 : Nurses working <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies provide <b>home</b> hospice <b>care</b> has been disproved and also the hypothesis No. 2 : Nurses working <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies are interested in expanding the <b>home</b> hospice <b>care</b> by means of mobile hospice units has been disproved, which means the first objective has been met. Further, we have found out that the lay public does not have sufficient information about the provision of hospice <b>care</b> by <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies, which means that the hypothesis No. 3 : The lay public has no information about the provision of hospice <b>care</b> by <b>home</b> <b>care</b> agencies has been confirmed and the second objective has been met. In this connection I have proposed some measures to improve the awareness of <b>home</b> hospice <b>care.</b> I have recommended informative articles to be developed for magazines intended for the lay public, as well as for professional journals for nurses.

40|$|Introduction: Financial {{incentives}} {{are widely used}} to get better value for money. Incentives {{can be applied to}} authorities responsible <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care,</b> or to agencies that provide services or to clients who receive care. Details of the financing system of <b>home</b> <b>care</b> services very much determine the possibilities for financial incentives. At present, {{there is a need for}} comparative information on financing mechanisms <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care.</b> Methods and Materials: This presentation is based on the results of the EC-financed EURHOMAP project. Indicators have been developed in this project to map the <b>home</b> <b>care</b> systems in Europe, including details of financing. In 2009 and early 2010, EURHOMAP partners have collected data on these indicators in 31 countries in collaboration with experts in these countries. Results: Prevailing models of financing <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> will be presented as well as information of the extent to which <b>home</b> <b>care</b> across Europe is pressured by financial restraints. Especially in Eastern European countries, where <b>home</b> <b>care</b> is not well developed yet, funding is a major problem. Co-payments are applicable in most countries to reduce expenditures and to prevent over-utilisation of services. Usually, financing mechanisms for social community based services differ from the mechanisms in place <b>for</b> <b>home</b> health <b>care</b> services. Consequently, modes of reimbursement for providers of different sorts of <b>home</b> <b>care</b> services and the financial implications for clients differ. Co-payments are more prevalent with social services than with health care. Another financial allocation mechanism is means testing, which is frequently used with publicly financed <b>home</b> <b>care</b> services. Conclusion: There is a large diversity in the type of financing mechanism, both between and within countries in Europe. Budgetary restraints are one of the main problems with regard to <b>home</b> <b>care</b> in almost all countries. Usually, access to <b>home</b> <b>care</b> services is restricted in some way by financial restrictions. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this project was {{to look at the}} costs of {{individuals}} with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), ALS, and MS in long stay <b>home</b> <b>care</b> in Ontario, Canada. The specific goals were to produce estimates of costs for these individuals, as well as identify clinical and personal characteristics associated with these costs. This project also tested the effectiveness of the Resource Utilization Group <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> case-mix system <b>for</b> use in these special populations. Methods: This project was conducted using a secondary analysis of assessment data from the Canadian Staff Time Resource Intensity Verification Project, a 13 -week study of <b>home</b> <b>care</b> costs (N= 435 141). The project was guided by the Andersen and Newman (1973) framework for healthcare resource utilization. Descriptive characteristics and mean costs were produced using bivariate frequency and means procedures for each of three conditions. Predictors of costs were identified {{for each of the three}} neurological conditions through multivariate regression analysis conducted separately for each condition. In total 41 independent variables were included into the bivariate and multivariate analyses. The dependent variable was the total weekly formal and informal <b>home</b> <b>care</b> costs across all multivariate analyses. Results: In total, ADRD, ALS, or MS diagnoses were present in 16 % of the assessments. The mean costs for the three conditions combined were $ 594. 81. The mean costs for ADRD, ALS, and MS were $ 593. 32, $ 898. 41, and $ 574. 92, respectively. Characteristics that were predictive of cost across all conditions included the Resource Utilization Group <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> case-mix system, ADL functionality, IADL functionality, cognitive performance, unsteady gait, stair use, difficulty swallowing, respiratory challenges, and bowel incontinence. The Resource Utilization Group <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> case-mix system had the highest level of explained variance of any single item tested in this project across all conditions. However, other clinical characteristics also contributed substantial levels of explained variance to the models for each of the three conditions. Conclusions: The findings from this project suggest that although diagnosis of ADRD, ALS, and/or MS can describe cost, clinical characteristics are the most important predictors of costs for individuals with these conditions. In addition, the Resource Utilization Group <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> case-mix system can adequately predict costs of individuals with these conditions. The addition of some clinical characteristics would likely improve the predictive abilities of the Resource Utilization Group <b>for</b> <b>home</b> <b>care</b> case-mix system...|$|R
