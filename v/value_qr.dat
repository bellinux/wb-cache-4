This paper {{studies the}} spatial {{variation}} of topsoil moisture within different soil types in a medium-size catchment at the Spanish Pre-Pyrenees (Estaña catchment, 2. 5 km 2) using seasonal data at high spatial resolution. Topsoil moisture {{was measured with}} a Delta-T Theta ProbeML 2 x device to 80 mm soil depth and at seasonal scale during 2005 and 2006. Measured values {{were related to the}} soil water content at field capacity to calculate the relative topsoil moisture (qR, %). The highest <b>values</b> of <b>qR</b> were obtained in autumn (53. 2 %) and the lowest in summer (32. 1 %), showing a positive correlation with seasonal precipitation and an inverse relationship with seasonal solar radiation (SR). Steep northern slopes presented the highest <b>values</b> of <b>qR</b> in spring, summer, and winter, and topsoil moisture progressively decreased from steep northern slopes to gentle slopes and from gentle slopes to steep southern slopes, defining a topographical trend. Any topographical trend was observed in autumn when <b>values</b> of <b>qR</b> were very high within the whole catchment. No significant correlation was found between <b>values</b> of <b>qR</b> and those of topographic wetness index (TWI) except in summer. Relative topsoil moisture varied greatly for the different soil types, and the highest values were also measured in steep northern slopes in spring, summer, and winter. Correlation between qR and SR was good for the different soil types in winter when SR varied the most for the different physiographic units and the range of <b>values</b> of <b>qR</b> was the highest. No significant correlation was found in autumn for any soil type due to the very low values of solar radiation. Results of this work draw attention to the importance of considering the slope steepness and aspect conditions for a more precise characterisation of moisture-sensitive areas in Mediterranean environments and soils at seasonal scale...|$|R

We identify two classes of pricing strategies, namely, no-price commitment strategy and price commitment strategy.

We also prove that when customers possess beliefs about the markdown in the second period being smaller enough, a firm obtains a high profit with price commitment; otherwise he obtains a high profit without price commitment. Moreover, we distinguish the competitive advantage of a QR system from two strategies. When a firm uses no-price commitment strategy, the <b>value</b> of <b>QR</b> system in the first period decreases and in the second period increases with customer’s strategic behavior.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years, Digital Signal Processing {{algorithm}} implementation {{has been driven}} by the continued progress and availability of high speed FPGA/ASIC circuit technology. The classic method of CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) arithmetic has been widely implemented as part of the computational requirements of the well known QR decomposition - Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm. This thesis presents a novel FPGA implementation of a complex arithmetic <b>valued</b> <b>QR</b> decomposition which can function in adaptive filter applications and implement the adaptive filter weight extraction without using the traditional back-substitution method. In order to operate Givens rotation on a complex valued system, Double Angle Complex Rotation (DACR) is adopted to simplify the computational requirement of the classic Complex Givens Rotation (CGR). A new modified ‘processor-like’ architecture of a DACR based QR-RLS is presented. It features a single arithmetic Processing Element (PE) that has been extensively pipelined and efficiently shared for the implementation of the Givens transform associated with the QR algorithm. Annihilation-Reordering look-ahead Transformation (ART) was used to pipeline and hence speed up the real valued QR-RLS adaptive signal processing array without changing the filter’s convergence behavior. This thesis extends the ART technique to cope with a complex valued QR-RLS computation array, results in a novel Complex valued Annihilation-Reordering look-ahead Transformation (C-ART). The complex Givens rotation implemented in CORDIC arithmetic is suitable for the cut-set pipelining thus increasing the throughput. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} feature of the wave equation is that its solutions q(r, t) are uniquely specified once the initial <b>values</b> <b>q(r,</b> 0) and (del) q(r, 0) /@t are specified. As was mentioned before, if we view the wave equation as describing a continuum limit {{of a network of}} coupled oscillators, then this result is very reasonable since one must specify the initial position and velocity of an oscillator to uniquely determine its motion. It is possible to write down other “equations of motion” that exhibit wave phenomena but which only require the initial values of the dynamical variable — not its time derivative — to specify a solution. This is physically appropriate in a number of situations, the most significant of which is in quantum mechanics where the wave equation is called the Schrodinger equation. This equation describes the time development of the observable attributes of a particle via the wave function (or probability amplitude). In quantum mechanics, the complete specification of the initial conditions of the particle’s motion is embodied in the initial value of. The price paid for this change in the allowed initial data while asking for a linear wave equation is the introduction of complex numbers into the equation for the wave. Indeed, the values taken by are complex numbers. In what follows we shall explore some of the elementary features of the wave phenomena associated with the Schrodinger equation. [URL]...|$|R

A total of 273 species were classified into 25 FGs and seven MBFGs. The most dominant FGs recorded (D, P, B, M, F, P, J and F) preferred nutrient rich conditions, whereas the appearance of lacustrine groups (W 1, T, Y, Lo) reflected an increase of water residence time. Between MBFG groups, VI was the most dominant.
