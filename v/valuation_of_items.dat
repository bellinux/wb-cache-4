These factors have contributed to use different criteria to recognize the structure of financial statements and the option for different bases of valuation. They also affect the scope and disclosures in the financial statements. Committee IASC is employed in mitigating these differences and seeks to harmonize regulations, standards and procedures for preparing and presenting financial statements. Harmonization requires that financial statements provide useful information for making economic decisions. The elements in balance sheets are recognized according to four basic criteria: definition, measurable character, relevance, reliability.

40|$|Recently, some {{mainstream}} e-commerce {{web sites}} have begun using “pay-per-bid ” auctions to sell items, from video games to bars of gold. In these auctions, bidders incur a cost for placing each bid {{in addition to}} (or sometimes in lieu of) the winner’s final purchase cost. Thus even when a winner’s purchase cost is a small fraction <b>of</b> the <b>item’s</b> intrinsic value, the auctioneer can still profit handsomely from the bid fees. Our work provides novel analyses for these auctions, based on both modeling and datasets derived from auctions at Swoopo. com, the leading pay-per-bid auction site. While previous modeling work predicts profit-free equilibria, we analyze the impact of information asymmetry broadly, as well as Swoopo features such as bidpacks and the Swoop It Now option specifically. We find that even small asymmetries across players (cheaper bids, better estimates of other players’ intent, different <b>valuations</b> <b>of</b> <b>items,</b> committed players willing to play “chicken”) can increase the auction duration significantly and thus skew the auctioneer’s profit disproportionately. We discuss our findings {{in the context of}} a dataset of thousands of live auctions we observed on Swoopo, which enables us also to examine behavioral factors, such as the power of aggressive bidding. Ultimately, our findings show that even with fully rational players, if players overlook or are unaware any of these factors, the result is outsized profits for pay-per-bid auctioneers. 1...|$|R

40|$|Auctions are {{probably}} the most important mechanism for dynamic pricing in electronic commerce. Although they constitute a very old mechanism as well, the new popularity has raisen a lot of questions on the appropriate design of an auction mechanism for a particular situation. This chapter describes reasons for auction popularity by setting them into the context of trends in electronic commerce. We then illustrate the main issues in auction design. Our analysis starts with simple single-item auctions, as we can see them in many B 2 C markets. We then look at the more complex auction designs, which are necessary for B 2 B markets. For the latter design has to take into account that buyers want to purchase collections <b>of</b> <b>items</b> and services, and that the valuation for winning collections is not simply equal to the sum <b>of</b> <b>valuations</b> <b>of</b> single <b>items.</b> We show how multi-item auction mechanisms can benefit from a synthesis of microeconomic and mathematical optimization models. ...|$|R

Importantly, this work demonstrates a reversal of the often-documented consequence of endowment effect in for profit contexts, in which stronger feelings of ownership over an item typically increases the difficulty in parting with the item. Consistent with previous work on the endowment effect, we find stronger feelings of ownership increase owners’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>item</b> in donation markets. However, counter to traditional endowment effect outcomes, this increased expectation of value to the receiver in turn increases, rather than decreases, the likelihood that donors will part with their own items and items over which they feel stronger feelings of ownership...|$|R
