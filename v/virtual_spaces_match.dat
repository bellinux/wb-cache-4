40|$|The {{application}} of aesthetics and techniques from photography into computer generated images leads audiences to read {{images of a}} <b>virtual</b> <b>space</b> similarly to images of a physical space. This phenomenon has allowed for a continuation in the cultural fascination with photorealism, and cases of audiences mistaking images from the <b>virtual</b> <b>space</b> as ‘real’. This thesis looks in detail at how the boundaries between the <b>virtual</b> and physical <b>space</b> shift when approaching the <b>virtual</b> <b>space</b> of a video game {{from the perspective of}} a photographer, rather than a player. It looks in detail at how audiences interpret images of the <b>virtual</b> <b>space</b> of video games when displayed in a form reminiscent of art photography. Photographs of the <b>virtual</b> and physical <b>spaces</b> were produced for online surveys and an exhibition to test audience perceptions of image origin. Participants were also asked to try and distinguish photorealism in the landscape form, urban form, and material form. Technical analysis of audience responses, combined with textual analysis of the images themselves, helped in determining the types of content, as well as styles of photography that were used by the audience as indexes to reality in the <b>virtual</b> <b>space.</b> In some cases, the technical theory could explain the thought process of the participants, however in other cases there were dominant factors that more significantly impacted participant interpretations, despite what theory suggested. This highlighted the blur that is emerging between the physical and <b>virtual</b> <b>spaces.</b> There were difficulties in designing tests that could identify and isolate the elements that influenced perceptions of photorealism, due to the complex, and sometimes unexpected, ways in which people made judgments about the images. A variety of factors and areas for future research arose from the tests, including using the medium of photography to document the ever-changing landscape of the <b>virtual</b> <b>space...</b>|$|R

This paper {{discusses the}} disconnections of binary oppositions caused by simulations, specifically it discusses {{the ways in}} which our conceptions of <b>virtual</b> <b>spaces,</b> interactions, and selves are recontextualized through the narratives of William Gibson, M. T. Anderson, and Neal Stephenson. This discussion is framed through a discussion of Las Vegas as a place of almost constant deterritorialization. As such Las Vegas functions as a microcosmic representation of the very issues surrounding simulated space, selves, and interactions, since it serves as a place where the <b>virtual</b> <b>space,</b> self, and interaction are all privileged and, possibly more importantly, where we can see individuals treat spaces, selves, and interactions differently because they are acutely aware of their hyperreal/simulated/virtual nature. It is also important to note that these issues arise in three different modes of representation: the literary novel, the popular comedy film, and the short televised commercial, which deterritorializes our conception of heteronomous (popular) and autonomous (high) art. Similarly, Gibson's Neuromancer, Stephenson's Snow Crash, and Anderson's Feed illuminate ways in which portions of our society privilege <b>virtual</b> <b>space,</b> selves, and interactions and how the treatment of <b>virtual</b> <b>space,</b> being, and interaction is affected by its hyperreal/simulated/virtual nature. These treatments of <b>virtual</b> <b>space,</b> selves, and interaction deterritorialize the reader, since they cause the disconnection of many traditional binary oppositions associated with <b>virtual</b> <b>spaces,</b> selves, and interactions...|$|R

40|$|Within {{constructed}} spaces our {{identities are}} evident in our interaction with objects, language and practice. The spaces that are understood as "virtual" are additions to an environment we have to locate our bodies within. Objects of technology, an engagement with language or a practice of art utilise our bodies as the zero point for experience of space. "Virtual space" is constructed {{through the use of}} objects we associate with the idea of "virtual space" such as consoles, computers and phones. The critical evaluation of <b>virtual</b> <b>space</b> has battled with the idea of the "disincarnated" experience of content, where the body is not the starting point. <b>Virtual</b> <b>space</b> is populated by objects that have physical form. Much like the impossibility of a person surviving on information alone it has become evident that the idea of a virtual disembodied utopia must come back down to earth. The discussion of the form of our identity in <b>virtual</b> <b>space</b> has had to redefine what virtual is, and how form can participate in constructing space. The discussion of form has had to contextualise a concrete practice and a beginning point within the body. The ideas and theories of Lakoff and Johnson, Carr, Talbolt, Fei, Dibble, Rendell, Turkle, Barthes, Davies, Sontag, Hockney, and Merleau-Ponty are evidence that there is an embodied point of view and human experience of "virtual" space. This thesis will use concrete spatial strategies of an artistic and auto-ethnographic practice to show that <b>virtual</b> <b>space</b> and the form of identity are concrete components of everyday environments. Form plays pivotal role in deconstructing or constructing space. Through the use of panorama, as an object of technology as well as a strategy, space is constructed using form. The term avatar used to discuss the "form" of identity in <b>virtual</b> <b>spaces,</b> and in particular what we currently recognise as "online" software driven, or connective <b>virtual</b> <b>spaces.</b> I have recognised that <b>virtual</b> <b>space</b> as not separate but augmentative and I will discuss how the avatar has been utilised within my practice to define <b>virtual</b> <b>space</b> as augmentative to everyday spaces...|$|R
