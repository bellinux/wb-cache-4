5|$|After {{the end of}} the war Norsk Hydro had {{a strong}} liquidity, while the Green Revolution and {{increased}} industrialization of agriculture in Europe boomed the demand for the products; from 1945 to 1955 production increased eightfold. The increased transport was a heavy burden on the two steamships, and in 1953 Norsk Transport ordered MF Storegut, a diesel powered ship of 1119 gross tonnes. She was launched on 25 May 1956, and the two older ferries were put to reserve duty in the meantime. A number of upgrades were made to the line, and the two locomotives 9 and 10 were bought in 1958. This was followed by the three diesel locomotives 20, 21 and 22 from Henschel. In 1966 two NSB El 1 locomotives were bought, and the <b>voltage</b> <b>on</b> the line increased from 10 to 15 kV.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for calculating the induced <b>voltages</b> <b>on</b> fence wires and pipelines underneath AC power transmission lines. The method {{is based on}} the charge simulation techniques and takes into account disturbances of the electric field and potential due to the presence of the fence wire or pipeline underneath the line. The calculated and previously measured induced <b>voltages</b> <b>on</b> fence wires are compared. Induced <b>voltages</b> <b>on</b> pipelines underneath 230 and 380 kV lines were measured. The results are correlated with the calculated values and discussed in the light of electric field induction on objects adjacent to AC power transmission line...|$|R

25|$|The {{very long}} time {{constants}} of 19th and early 20th century submarine communications cables required a different form of Morse signalling. Instead of keying a <b>voltage</b> <b>on</b> and off for varying times, the dits and dahs were represented by two polarities of voltage impressed on the cable, for a uniform time.|$|E
25|$|The MOSFET is used {{in digital}} {{complementary}} metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) logic, which uses p- and n-channel MOSFETs as building blocks. Overheating {{is a major concern}} in integrated circuits since ever more transistors are packed into ever smaller chips. CMOS logic reduces power consumption because no current flows (ideally), and thus no power is consumed, except when the inputs to logic gates are being switched. CMOS accomplishes this current reduction by complementing every nMOSFET with a pMOSFET and connecting both gates and both drains together. A high <b>voltage</b> <b>on</b> the gates will cause the nMOSFET to conduct and the pMOSFET not to conduct and a low <b>voltage</b> <b>on</b> the gates causes the reverse. During the switching time as the voltage goes from one state to another, both MOSFETs will conduct briefly. This arrangement greatly reduces power consumption and heat generation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} weight {{dynamics}} of the floating-gate pFET synapse {{and the effects of}} the pFET’s gate and drain <b>voltages</b> <b>on</b> these dynamics. We show that we can derive a weight update rule such that the equilibrium weight value is proportional to the correlation between the gate and drain voltages. In particular, we want a rule of the form 1 _ = 1 + [], where is a <b>voltage</b> signal <b>on</b> the gate terminal and is a <b>voltage</b> signal <b>on</b> the drain terminal. We obtain this rule by making a linear approximation to the weight dynamics around a given equilibrium point. We develop this approximation by considering the basic functional form of the system dynamics and then examining the effects of the gate and drain <b>voltages</b> <b>on</b> the specifics of this form.

25|$|Klystrons and {{magnetrons}} often operate their anodes (called collectors in klystrons) {{at ground}} potential to facilitate cooling, particularly with water, without high-voltage insulation. These tubes instead operate with high negative <b>voltages</b> <b>on</b> the filament and cathode.|$|R
25|$|If {{used in a}} {{location}} with strong magnetic fields, which can curve electron paths, steer the electrons away from the dynodes and cause loss of gain, photomultipliers are usually magnetically shielded by a layer of soft iron or mu-metal. This magnetic shield is often maintained at cathode potential. When this is the case, the external shield must also be electrically insulated {{because of the high}} <b>voltage</b> <b>on</b> it. Photomultipliers with large distances between the photocathode and the first dynode are especially sensitive to magnetic fields.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of a {{switched-mode}} power supply, a boost converter is inserted between the bridge rectifier and the main input capacitors. The boost converter attempts to maintain a constant DC bus <b>voltage</b> <b>on</b> its output while drawing a current that is always in phase with and at the same frequency as the line voltage. Another switched-mode converter inside the power supply produces the desired output voltage from the DC bus. This approach requires additional semiconductor switches and control electronics, but permits cheaper and smaller passive components. It is frequently used in practice.|$|E
25|$|The {{necessary}} {{distribution of}} voltage along {{the series of}} dynodes is created by a voltage divider chain, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In the example, the photocathode is held at a negative high voltage of order 1000V, while the anode {{is very close to}} ground potential. The capacitors across the final few dynodes act as local reservoirs of charge to help maintain the <b>voltage</b> <b>on</b> the dynodes while electron avalanches propagate through the tube. Many variations of design are used in practice; the design shown is merely illustrative.|$|E

The results of currents and <b>voltages</b> <b>on</b> windings are provided. In addition, the magnetic field is displayed. The transient response of three-phase power transformer is simulated for the case of unbalanced loadings and the case of one opened loading.

25|$|The ATG {{function}} {{was designed to}} improve the BSP feature to be faster {{and to keep the}} best resolution and contrast at all times. It is particularly suitable for Aviator’s Night Vision goggles, operations in urban areas or for special operations. ATG is a unique feature that operates constantly, electronically reducing the “duty cycle” of the photocathode voltage by very rapidly switching the <b>voltage</b> <b>on</b> and off. This maintains the optimum performance of the I² tube, continuously revealing mission critical details, safeguarding the I² tube from additional damage and protecting the user from temporary blindness.|$|E
25|$|Electromechanical {{regulators}} called voltage stabilizers or tap-changers, {{have also}} been used to regulate the <b>voltage</b> <b>on</b> AC power distribution lines. These regulators operate by using a servomechanism to select the appropriate tap on an autotransformer with multiple taps, or by moving the wiper on a continuously variable auto transfomer. If the output voltage {{is not in the}} acceptable range, the servomechanism switches the tap, changing the turns ratio of the transformer, to move the secondary voltage into the acceptable region. The controls provide a dead band wherein the controller will not act, preventing the controller from constantly adjusting the voltage ("hunting") as it varies by an acceptably small amount.|$|E
25|$|The SM83, ST86 and ST89 {{were not}} subject to the cable and braking issue and were {{therefore}} kept in service. Originally Oslo ordered seventeen SL95s and planned to keep either the SM83 or the SM91 units. However, the options for another fifteen SL95s was redeemed, allowing all non-articulated trams to be retired. As the SL95 units were delivered, retirement of SM83 commenced in mid 1999. The choice to retire SM83 before SM91 was both that the former were in worse technical condition and that the need to raise the <b>voltage</b> <b>on</b> the tramway to 750 volts. SM91 had proven that it could adapt to such in Gothenburg, an outcome that the SM83 could not be sure of duplicating.|$|E

25|$|At larger {{gate bias}} still, near the {{semiconductor}} surface the conduction band edge is brought {{close to the}} Fermi level, populating the surface with electrons in an inversion layer or n-channel at the interface between the p region and the oxide. This conducting channel extends between the source and the drain, and current is conducted through it when a voltage is applied between the two electrodes. Increasing the <b>voltage</b> <b>on</b> the gate leads to a higher electron density in the inversion layer and therefore increases the current flow between the source and drain. For gate voltages below the threshold value, the channel is lightly populated, and {{only a very small}} subthreshold leakage current can flow between the source and the drain.|$|E
25|$|Stray voltage is {{a result}} of the design of a 4 wire {{distribution}} system and as such has existed as long as such systems have been used. Stray voltage became a problem for the dairy industry some time after electric milking machines were introduced, and large numbers of animals were simultaneously in contact with metal objects grounded to the electric distribution system and the earth. Numerous studies document the causes, physiological effects, and prevention, of stray voltage in the farm environment. Today, stray <b>voltage</b> <b>on</b> farms is regulated by state governments and controlled by the design of equipotential planes in areas where livestock eat, drink or give milk. Commercially available neutral isolators also prevent elevated potentials on the utility system neutral from raising the voltage of farm neutral or ground wires.|$|E
25|$|Tube heaters {{may also}} fail without warning, {{especially}} if exposed to over voltage or {{as a result}} of manufacturing defects. Tube heaters do not normally fail by evaporation like lamp filaments, since they operate at much lower temperature. The surge of inrush current when the heater is first energized causes stress in the heater, and can be avoided by slowly warming the heaters, gradually increasing current with a NTC thermistor included in the circuit. Tubes intended for series-string operation of the heaters across the supply have a specified controlled warm-up time to avoid excess <b>voltage</b> <b>on</b> some heaters as others warm up. Directly heated filament-type cathodes as used in battery-operated tubes or some rectifiers may fail if the filament sags, causing internal arcing. Excess heater-to-cathode voltage in indirectly heated cathodes can break down the insulation between elements and destroy the heater.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} AC-induced <b>voltages</b> <b>on</b> {{corrosion}} systems was investigated. Two cases were distinguished: the anodic and cathodic reactions were under activation control, the anodic reaction was under activation {{control and the}} cathodic reaction was under mixed control. For the first case simple relations could be derived that relate the AC-induced voltage with the corrosion potential and corrosion rate. For the second case numerical analysis was necessary to obtain these relations. It was shown that {{the influence of the}} AC-induced <b>voltages</b> <b>on</b> the corrosion behaviour strongly depended on the Tafel parameters. As the cathodic reaction was under mixed control the increase of the corrosion rate was limited to the diffusion-limited current density. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.
