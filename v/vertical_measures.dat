40|$|Horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>measures</b> of {{inequality}} are related through mobility. The paper {{draws attention to}} two types of mobility: quantity mobility, which refers to mobility in income itself, and rank mobility, which refers to mobility in the position {{in the distribution of}} income. Individually matched census data for earnings in Israel are used to illustrate these concepts empirically. Mobility is measured between 1983 and 1995. It is shown that earnings in Israel are highly mobile. The high degree of earnings mobility implies that horizontal measures {{of inequality}} considerably overstate the underlying level of inequality. The method of errors in variables is used to distinguish between current and permanent mobility and inequality. Permanent earnings are more equal than current earnings and less mobile. Finally, the methodology is applied to PSID. It is shown that earnings were more mobile in Israel than in the United States. Copyright 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the light}} of the weak {{performance}} of the Philippine manufacturing industry and the absence of structural transformation of the economy from agriculture to manufacturing in the last two decades, the paper calls for the implementation of a new industrial policy. This is crucial not only to upgrade Philippine industries, generate more and better jobs, and reduce poverty but also {{to take advantage of the}} market opportunities and face the challenges arising from the ASEAN Economic Community. Based on the sectoral roadmaps submitted by industries to the Department of Trade and Industry and Board of Investments, the paper has formulated a comprehensive industrial strategy to enable manufacturing firms to upgrade, thrive, and become catalysts and engines for sustained and inclusive growth. The long-term vision of the Manufacturing Industry Roadmap is to develop a globally competitive manufacturing industry supported by strong backward and forward linkages with both domestic and global supply chains. Through the implementation of the roadmap, manufacturing contribution to the economy would account for 30 percent of total value added and generate 15 percent of total employment. Industry policies will focus on horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>measures</b> and a coordination mechanism to enhance firm productivity, strengthen supply chains to enable firms to move up the technology scale, link domestic firms with multinational companies, and aggressively court more investment. Horizontal measures will cover human resource development, small and medium enterprises development, technology upgrading and innovation, investment promotion, and a competitive exchange rate policy. It will also address issues such as high power and logistics cost, smuggling, and infrastructure weaknesses. <b>Vertical</b> <b>measures</b> will address gaps in industry supply chains and expand the domestic market base as springboard for exports. A coordination mechanism will be designed to allow more interaction between government agencies and industries in identifying obstacles and determining the most appropriate interventions. The roadmap implementation will be private-sector led while the government acts as facilitator. As facilitating government, it will encourage producers to take risks, correct market and government failures, and address changes in policies and institutions. By creating the proper environment and strengthening industries, the government can promote the success of domestic firms in both the local and international markets that will lead to economic transformation. Only with the right environment can manufacturing unleash its full potentials to take advantage of the market opportunities currently facing us and become an engine for sustained and inclusive growth...|$|E

40|$|How to hold {{autonomous}} {{schools and}} school governing boards {{accountable for their}} decisions and performance has become a particularly pressing question for central governments in many OECD countries. Increasing complexity in education systems {{has led to a}} greater degree of freedom in decision making for many local authorities, school governing boards and schools. However despite this increasing decentralisation, central governments are still held responsible by the general public for ensuring high quality education. During the last ten years, school accountability has become a critical topic, triggered by the results of international benchmarks such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). This paper analyses trends in accountability mechanisms and processes and argues that <b>vertical</b> <b>measures</b> of accountability, that is, regulatory and school performance accountability, can be usefully augmented by horizontal measures involving multiple stakeholders. This system of multiple school accountability aims to efficiently and effectively take into account the nuanced nature and purposes of education.

The aims of this study were: to evaluate the intra-examiner agreement in the acquisition of measures using two methods (manual and computer program - Radioimp), comparing their performances. Three examiners analyzed twenty-one panoramic radiographs. They used the two methods in two occasions. In the manual method, the examiners made a tracing on a paper fixed to the images and measured nine regions with a caliper. The images were digitalized and showed in a computer screen to be analyzed in the computer program. The examiners acquired measures of the same regions by the manual method. <b>Vertical</b> <b>measures</b> of spheres in the images were acquired in order to discount the magnifying factor of the technique.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse the development of industrial policy in the European Union. The changing concepts and rationale for industrial policy are reported with reference to the treaties and communications of the European Commission. Industrial policy has followed the course of these changes, although in reality, the practical changes have occurred at a slower and less radical pace than the changes in philosophy. A new paradigm of industrial policy has recently been developed by the European Commission in a document that first calls for measures improving the competitiveness in all sectors in terms of rather broad measures, and subsequently acknowledges sector differences in the impact of these measures, calling for complementary sector-specific measures. We label this new paradigm the âmatrix approach â to industrial policy, because it combines horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>measures.</b> On the empirical level, we see a divide between countries practising a future-oriented approach emphasising innovation and knowledge, and countries that take a more defensive stance, with higher subsidies and a greater amount of regulation. The countries pursuing the more future-oriented approach achieve higher shares of technology-driven and skill-intensive industries and excel with respect to the goals of the Lisbon strategy.

40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} under certain symmetry, {{the images of}} {{complete}} harmonic embeddings from the complex plane into the hyperbolic plane is completely determined by the geometric information of the <b>vertical</b> <b>measured</b> foliation and is independent of the horizontal measured foliation of the corresponding Hopf differentials. In this paper, we find a new explicit relation between the image of harmonic embeddings, with certain symmetry, from the complex plane C into the hyperbolic plane H 2 and the metric of the associated R-tree of the corresponding <b>vertical</b> <b>measured</b> foliation of the Hopf differentials. Unlike {{in the case of}} compact surfaces, holomorphic quadratic differentials cannot be determined by the <b>vertical</b> <b>measured</b> foliation only. So it is kind of surprising for us to find that the image set of the corresponding complete harmonic embedding is completely determined by the <b>vertical</b> <b>measured</b> foliation and is independent of the geometric information of the horizontal measured foliation. The symmetry condition that we consider is as follow. We assume that the harmonic embedding u from C into H 2 is invariant under the group Zk by rotations and its image is an ideal polygon with 2 k vertices for any integer k â¥ 2. This is the next nontrivial case after the case of Z 2 k symmetry which gives harmonic embeddings with regular polygonal images. This condition can be regarded as u having half of the symmetry of a regular polygon. The symmetry assumption implies that the Hopf differentials are of the form [z 2 m â (a + ib) z mâ 1]dz 2 for a + ib â C. For a generic holomorphic quadratic differential in this family, the associated R-tree has m + 1 finite edges of equal length given by Î½ = Ï|b|/(2 (m + 1)). We will show that Theorem 1. Let u: C â H 2 be the unique (up to equivalence) complete orientation preserving harmonic embedding associated to a quadratic differential equivalent to [z 2 m â(a+ib) z mâ 1]dz 2.

40|$|Vertical {{take-off}} velOCity in ski-jumping {{has already}} been dealt with in some studies (Jost and Strojnik, 1992; Vaverka, 1987). Lately the interest of researchers {{in the study of}} vertical velocity, particularly in field conditions, has increased even more owing to the development of adequate technological means. The intent and objective of this investigation was to study the problems concerning the vertical velocity of take-off in ski-jumping as one of the fundamental parameters of successful performance of a jumper.

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding the {{different}} patterns of anxiety-like behavioral responses {{is of great}} interest for pharmacological and genetic research. Here we report the effects of 3. 5 -hr habituation, buspirone and ethanol on those responses in shoaling zebrafish (Danio rerio). Since in these experiments we used a container with white walls, the effects of black-vs. -white walls were tested in a separate experiment. An important objective {{was to determine whether}} factors unrelated to anxiety played a role in modulating the responses. The anxiety-like behavioral responses studied here are social cohesion, distance from bottom and bottom-dwell time, radial distribution (to study thigmotaxis), transparent-wall preference (to study escape responses), locomotion and freezing. The experimental conditions yielded distinctly different response patterns. Thigmotaxis was the most obvious response to white walls and it was significantly reduced after 3. 5 -hr habituation. It was not affected by any of the drugs. The reduction of social cohesion after 3. 5 -hr habituation and in the 0. 5 % ethanol group was probably the most interesting effect seen in this study. A role of anxiety herein was suggested but could not be established with certainty. Other hypotheses were also discussed. The large increase of distance-from-bottom resulting in swimming close to the water surface, which occurred in both buspirone groups and in the 0. 5 %-ethanol group, is most likely not an anxiolytic response, because of the discrepancy with the in the literature well-established time-course and the absence of any effect of 3. 5 -hr habituation or black walls on <b>vertical</b> <b>measures.</b> Finally, locomotion and duration freezing could not be specifically taken as indicators for the state of anxiety and the results concerning transparent-wall preference were not sufficient clear. We conclude that the neuronal and ethological mechanisms underlying the effects of habituation, white-aversion, buspirone and ethanol on anxiety-like behavioral responses are complex and need further exploration...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to measure {{marginal}} fit at cylinder-abutment interface, before and after overcasting procedure. A hexagonal implant was fixed to a stainless steel base and a Estheticone-like abutment used during all the experiment. Before casting procedure, gold (Group I) and Ni-Cr-Be (Group II) premachined cylinders were tightened to the abutment with gold and titanium screws (in both groups), with 10 Ncm and 20 Ncm torque values for the same screw type. <b>Vertical</b> <b>measures</b> were taken at the light microscope (Mitutoyo 5050, Tokyo, Japan) three times in six different parts along the abutment-cylinder interface for each torque value. Cylinders were overcast with Ag-Pd (Group I) or Ni-Cr-Be (Group II) alloy. After casting, the same measures and torque values were repeated. Intragroup differences (10 or 20 Ncm torque values, before and after casting) and intergroup differences (10 and 20 Ncm torque values, before or after casting) were analyzed by the Paired t Test; (p< 0. 05). Intragroup differences were observed for G-I (gold, 20 Ncm, titanium screw, p= 0. 044) and for G-II (Ni-Cr-Be, 10 Ncm, gold screw, p= 0. 002). Intergroup differences only were not observed in the G-II group (Ni-Cr-Be, 10 and 20 Ncm, titanium screw, p= 0. 534). Within the limits of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1) Regardless of screw type, marginal misfit was higher for Ni-Cr-Be cylinders after casting, but within acceptable levels of fit; 2) The combination of gold cylinders with gold or titanium screws was the most effective to reduce marginal misfit; 3) Both screw types did not improve marginal fit of Ni-Cr-Be cylinders after overcastting, and 4) Although a 20 Ncm torque improved marginal fit in all situations, its use is not recommended due to the increased risk of prosthesis failure. Ni-Cr-Be alloys may be successfully used in single-tooth implant restorations, with no damage to the fit between abutment and prosthetic cylinder...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to improve our {{understanding}} of plant â flow interactions and to develop new remote sensing techniques that would allow a marsh scale assessment of flow modification due {{to the presence of}} salt marsh vegetation. The limitations of current approaches which improve our understanding and prediction of tidal flows centre around poor assessments of canopy structure and mechanical properties. The validity of such simplified and reductionist assessments of canopy structure were tested and found to contribute considerable error in estimations of canopy frontal area and canopy drag. New metrics to assess canopy structure were tested as part of a flume study using two salt marsh species with varying form and architecture. Results from this experiment found that biomass located immediately below the water surface are important for determining fluid momentum losses in salt marsh canopies. These results {{led to the development of}} a new empirical based model using <b>vertical</b> <b>measures</b> of biomass and approach (incident) velocity which can accurately (R 2 0. 71) predict flow momentum losses. This suggests that the characteristic vegetation parameter and the drag coefficient may be substituted with vertical canopy biomass and an empirical coefficient. This may lead to more accurate assessments of canopy structure and thus comparable results across the literature as well as potentially apriori assignment of parameters in the force drag model. Vertical canopy biomass (3 D biomass) was then estimated at the marsh scale using a combined remote sensing approach and an empirical model. Accurate assessments of the marsh surface are critical for hydrodynamic models and important if we are to determine vertical changes in canopy structure. The approach first identified marsh surface returns by operating a moving average smoothing filter on Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data. The automated procedure detected vegetated and nonâvegetated surfaces using aerial NDVI which calibrated the filter and ensured ALS returns were representative of marsh surface elevation. Using the marsh surface DEM, vegetation was reconstructed at 0. 2 m grid cells. Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) was found to accurately quantify maximum canopy height (RMSE 0. 14 m) whilst a regression model using aerial NDVI and spatial coordinates gave reasonable predictions (RMSE 0. 08 kg/m 2) of total plot canopy biomass within each 0. 2 m cell across a ~ 20, 000 m 2 area of marsh. Ground measurements found the vertical distribution of canopy biomass followed a power law increase with elevation from the marsh bed. Combining all the approaches allowed the creation of a 3 D assessment of canopy biomass with an average error of 30 % of the mean amongst plots exhibiting larger canopy biomass (> 0. 4 kg/m 2). This vertical measure of biomass can be combined with the flow momentum loss model generated in the flume experiment to assess hydrodynamic canopy drag potential at the marsh scale. Roughness coefficients can also be calculated using this approach which can be easily fed into commercially available numerical flow models.
