5|$|In 1924, Moore won {{a six-month}} {{travelling}} scholarship which {{he spent in}} Northern Italy studying the great works of Michelangelo, Giotto di Bondone, Giovanni Pisano and several other Old Masters. During this period he also visited Paris, {{took advantage of the}} timed-sketching classes at the Académie Colarossi, and <b>viewed,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Trocadero, a plaster cast of a Toltec-Maya sculptural form, the Chac Mool, which he had previously seen in book illustrations. The reclining figure was to have a profound effect upon Moore's work, becoming the primary motif of his sculpture.|$|E

5|$|What {{has been}} {{thought to be}} his mummy can be <b>viewed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian Museum in Cairo. However, in 2007, Dr. Zahi Hawass {{announced}} that the mummy which was previously thought to be Thutmose I {{is that of a}} thirty-year-old man who had {{died as a result of}} an arrow wound to the chest. Because of the young age of the mummy and the cause of death, it was determined that the mummy was probably not that of King Thutmose I himself.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{a series}} of Historical Public Exposure Studies were {{conducted}} to assess past releases and public exposures. For example, the figure at right illustrates the calculated lifetime cancer risk to a laborer from the 1957 Rocky Flats fire. The key shows the cancer risk due to exposure during the 1957 event per million persons. This figure means that an outdoor laborer in the reddest part of Arvada would have roughly a two-in-a-million risk of contracting cancer (0.000002) from being outside during the 1957 fire. The original, complete figure - {{as well as many}} others showing the risks of past exposures - can be <b>viewed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Summary of Findings from the Historical Public Exposure Studies.|$|E
5|$|Over 2,500 people {{attended}} his memorial at Westminster Cathedral. A rose was {{planted in the}} memorial garden in Baldonnel Aerodrome in Dublin (home of the Irish Air Corps) where Brendan and his brother Ray first flew. Finucane's name is also inscribed on the Air Forces Memorial at Runnymede. The memorial commemorates airmen who {{were lost in the}} Second World War and who have no known grave. The Battle of Britain Memorial on London's Embankment also includes his name as one of The Few. His flying logbook can be <b>viewed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soldiers and Chief's exhibition in the National Museum of Ireland at Collins Barracks. The Finucane family donated Brendan Finucane's uniform to the Royal Air Force Museum London.|$|E

5|$|Potter's weariness with {{depicting}} rabbits {{is reflected}} in the book's pictures. Of the twenty-six illustrations, eight depict Mr. McGregor and seventeen the garden and its structures. There are almost no close-ups of the rabbits and none with the detail found in Benjamin Bunny. When the rabbits are depicted, they are <b>viewed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle distance in order to include all six as well as the garden background. They are depicted with little or no facial expression. It is likely Potter (a farm owner at the date of the book's composition) had come to view rabbits as undifferentiated pests rather than individual personalities. Several drawings for the illustrations for The Flopsy Bunnies were given to the British Museum in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Receiving {{light and}} other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer. For example, {{it has taken}} 13billion (13) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies <b>viewed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hubble Ultra Deep Field images. Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they {{appeared}} 13billion years ago, {{when the universe was}} less than a billion years old. The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Xillia {{consists}} {{primarily of}} two major areas: the field map and the battle screen. The field map is a realistically scaled 3D environment where the player character traverses and interacts with non-player characters, items, or mob avatars. On the field map, character interactions between the party can also be <b>viewed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a sketch story; these sketch stories {{are referred to as}} skits and consist of animated portraits and voice acting. When coming into contact with a mob avatar, the environment switches to the battle screen, a 3D representation of an area in which the player commands the characters in battles against the CPU-controlled mobs.|$|E

5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, the Evil Queen mourns {{the death}} of her husband, Snow White's father, {{although}} she herself is responsible for his death. Snow (Goodwin) and the Queen seemingly comfort each other over the loss. The Queen consults her magic mirror (Esposito) to ask how she can kill Snow, who is beloved by the people but a threat to her bid for the throne. She says that the king's knights will not kill his daughter, and the mirror tells her that she needs a huntsman. As Graham saw in his flashbacks, the Huntsman (Dornan) and his brother wolf seem to enjoy living a peaceful life in the woods. The Huntsman kills only for himself to live, and has no compassion for humans, who do not understand the wild. As the Huntsman and his wolf enter a tavern, the other patrons begin harassing him, prompting him to successfully defend himself. His performance is <b>viewed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> magic mirror by the Queen, who is greatly impressed. She summons the Huntsman to offer him anything he wants on the condition that he brings her Snow's heart. He agrees to this deal, in return asking for the protection of all the wolves in the Enchanted Forest.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which the player takes control of a silent protagonist that can be named and whose personality is determined by dialogue choices made in the game. Navigation is split into two types: standard navigation through the game's three-dimensional (3D) dungeons in a first-person view, and navigation around the protagonist's home of Hirasaki City using a 3D overworld map. During dungeon navigation, the player's route is automatically mapped, and the map can be <b>viewed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> menu screen. Non-playable characters (NPCs) are represented in first-person navigation with 2D sprites, and their speech is represented with head-and-shoulder portraits above dialogue boxes. Quests are available at a location called the House of Divination, which the player can choose to accept in exchange for rewards. Various stores are scattered throughout Hirasaki City for buying items, weapons and armor, and healing the player's party and reserves. A key currency in the game is Magnetite, which is used for summoning demons and as currency {{in some of the}} stores.|$|E
