2500|$|True vanilla {{comes from}} a seed pod of an orchid called <b>vanilla</b> <b>planifolia.</b> This plant grows as a vine on host trees and is native to this area. The pods are green when harvested, and turn black when dried. In the Totonac language, vanilla is called Xanath and is {{used to make a}} liquor which is almost never seen outside of the Papantla area. These people have used vanilla for centuries as a flavoring, a perfume and as medicine. In the early colonial period, the Spanish quickly {{exported}} vanilla to Europe and a number of cultivators became wealthy. The name “vanilla” comes from the Spanish “vainilla” which means little seed pod. The growing of vanilla remained a monopoly of Mexico until hand pollination methods were developed that allowed the plant to grow {{in other parts of the}} world, devastating the industry here. Today, Mexican production of vanilla trails behind production in parts of Africa and Asia. [...] In spite of this, the Academy of Sciences and Gastronomic Arts in Paris in 1921chose to pay homage to the Totonacs who discovered vanilla.|$|E

Hernán Cortés brought vanilla pods to Europe where they were grown in greenhouses, and cultivation was attempted in various tropical locations. Seed from Madagascar were taken to Tahiti in 1848 by the French Admiral Ferdinand-Alphonse Hamelin, and it was this foundation stock that is now cultivated as Vanilla tahitensis in French Polynesia. In Mexico, it is pollinated by a specific species of bee, so when grown elsewhere, the flowers need to be pollinated by hand in order for the pods to develop.|$|E

5000|$|The {{orchid family}} {{is one of}} the two largest {{families}} of angiosperms (the other is Asteraceae). The shape of the flowers is very distinctive, making orchids easy to recognize. The flower is bilaterally symmetrical. The three sepals are generally colourful and bright (which is why they are sometimes called outer tepals), with one on each side ("lateral sepals") and one usually {{at the top of the}} flower ("dorsal sepal"), sometimes forming a hood. The three petals (or inner tepals), also showy, are located alternately between the sepals, two at the side and one usually at the bottom of the flower. The lower petal is referred to as the [...] "labellum" [...] or [...] "lip", and is usually distinctively different from the side petals. Thelymitra is an example of a genus where the lower petal is similar in appearance to the other petals. The pollination systems of orchids are among the most complex and interesting of all the angiosperms. Orchids include many species of great ornamental value. Vanilla is obtained from the fruit of the orchid <b>Vanilla</b> <b>planifolia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Several {{mixtures}} of cacao {{are described in}} ancient texts, for ceremonial or medicinal, as well as culinary, purposes.

Archaeological evidence for use of cacao, while relatively sparse, {{has come from the}} recovery of whole cacao beans at Uaxactun, Guatemala and from the preservation of wood fragments of the cacao tree at Belize sites including Cuello and Pulltrouser Swamp. In addition, analysis of residues from ceramic vessels has found traces of theobromine and caffeine in early formative vessels from Puerto Escondido, Honduras (1100-900 BC) and in middle formative vessels from Colha, Belize (600-400 BC) using similar techniques to those used to extract chocolate residues from four classic period (around 400 AD) vessels from a tomb at the Maya archaeological site of Rio Azul. As cacao is the only known commodity from Mesoamerica containing both of these alkaloid compounds, it seems likely these vessels were used as containers for cacao drinks. In addition, cacao is named in a hieroglyphic text on one of the Rio Azul vessels. Cacao was also believed to be ground by the Aztecs and mixed with tobacco for smoking purposes.|$|E
5000|$|Harvesting vanilla fruits is as labor-intensive as pollinating the blossoms. Immature, {{dark green}} pods are not harvested. Pale yellow {{discoloration}} that commences at the distal {{end of the}} fruits {{is not a good}} indication of the maturity of pods. Each fruit ripens at its own time, requiring a daily harvest. [...] "Current methods for determining the maturity of vanilla (<b>Vanilla</b> <b>planifolia</b> Andrews) beans are unreliable. Yellowing at the blossom end, the current index, occurs before beans accumulate maximum glucovanillin concentrations. Beans left on the vine until they turn brown have higher glucovanillin concentrations but may split and have low quality. Judging bean maturity is difficult as they reach full size soon after pollination. Glucovanillin accumulates from 20 weeks, maximum about 40 weeks after pollination. Mature green beans have 20% dry matter but less than 2% glucovanillin." [...] The accumulation of dry matter and glucovanillin are highly correlated.To ensure the finest flavor from every fruit, each individual pod must be picked by hand just as it begins to split on the end. Overmatured fruits are likely to split, causing a reduction in market value. Its commercial value is fixed based on the length and appearance of the pod.|$|E
