40|$|Sporadic {{and costly}} failure of newly planted vines {{is an ongoing}} problem in the Australian wine industry. Failed vines are {{frequently}} infected with wood pathogens, including the fungi associated with Young Vine Decline. Hot water treatment (HWT) and other nursery practices have also been implicated in vine failure. We undertook a survey of Australian grapevine nurseries to {{develop an understanding of}} current propagation practices and to facilitate the development of reliable propagation procedures that consistently produce high quality vines. A survey covering all aspects of grapevine propagation including sources of cuttings, HWT, sanitation and cold storage was mailed to all 60 trading Australian <b>vine</b> <b>nurseries.</b> In all, 25 nurseries responded, a response rate of 41. 7 %. Practices were found to vary widely both within and between nurseries. The vast majority of respondents (20) reported that they currently used, or had used, HWT, but the reliability of HWT was questioned by most nursery operators. A majority (18) felt that some Vitis vinifera varieties were more sensitive to HWT than others. Hydration also emerged as an important factor that had the potential to affect vine quality. All respondents used hydration and although the majority used treated water, cuttings were not generally seen as a source of cross contamination. Our study identified a clear need for further research into the effects of HWT on cutting physiology and the role of hydration in the epidemiology of grapevine pathogens, and the importance of incorporating the results of such research into practical and comprehensive propagation guidelines for <b>vine</b> <b>nurseries...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{easiest way}} to {{introduce}} phylloxera to a site is by infested plant material. If a grower can effectively remove any existing phylloxera on new plants, the rate of spread of phylloxera. in Oregon vineyards will be significantly decreased. The objectives {{of this study are}} to determine methods for dipping of young self-rooted and grafted <b>vines</b> (<b>nursery</b> stock) that will eradicate existing phylloxera populations without causing plant damage. In November, 1993, an initial hot water dip study involved dipping all life stages of phylloxera and five different rootstocks (not grafted) in 125 °F water for 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 minutes. Three root pieces with established populations of eggs, nymphs, and adults were dipped for each time treatment. After the heat treatment, the root pieces were placed in petri dishes and stored in an incubator. Data on percent survival for each life stage and amount of time to kill all life stages were collected. The results showed that all life stages were killed at the five minute dip in 125 °F water. The five rootstocks studied were Pinot Noir, 5 C, 101 - 14, 3309 C, and Freedom. The dormant plants were removed from their pots, washed free of soil, and pruned to 4 buds and 6 " root length. Control plants were dipped in 70 °F for 10 minutes (5 minutes as a pre-dip and 5 minutes for the time needed to eradicate the insect). The hot water dip plants received a predip of 5 minutes at 110 °F to warm the roots and then were given a 5 minute dip in 125 °F water. After dipping, all plants were placed in pots and forced in a greenhouse. The percent budbreak of primary, secondary, and tertiary shoots was evaluated. The results determined that all plants broke bud in all time intervals but the control plants had a higher percentage of bud break. A second dip will be conducted in January, 1995, including hibernants and grafted rootstocks...|$|R
40|$|Petri {{disease is}} a {{vascular}} disease associated with decline and dieback of young grapevines. A major means of spread of the causal organisms, Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Phaeoacremonium spp., is via infected propagation material. Since no curative control measures are known, proactive measures must be taken in grapevine nurseries to manage this disease. To study this aspect, semicommercial trials with naturally infected rootstock material were performed in grapevine nurseries in South Africa. Prior to grafting, rootstocks were treated as follows: 1 -h drench in suspensions of benomyl, phosphoric acid, different bacterial and Trichoderma formulations, water, or hot water treated (HWT; 30 min at 50 °C). Grafted cuttings were planted and grown in a greenhouse and two commercial field nurseries and uprooted 8 months later. In instances where rootstocks were treated with benomyl or Trichoderma formulations, the incidences of Phaeomoniella and Phaeoacremonium in grafted cuttings and uprooted <b>nursery</b> <b>vines</b> were significantly {{lower than that of}} the water treatment. However, the reduction was most consistent and noteworthy in vines on rootstocks that received HWT prior to grafting. HWT of dormant <b>nursery</b> <b>vines</b> effected a similar reduction in Phaeomoniella and Phaeoacremonium incidence. Root-stock drenches in benomyl and/or Trichoderma formulations could thus be integrated with HWT for the proactive management of Petri disease in grapevine nurseries. Articl...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{fumigation}} with {{methyl bromide}} has commonly been used prior to planting field nurseries. The California Code of Regulations, section 3640, makes it “mandatory that nursery stock for farm planting be commercially clean {{with respect to}} economically important nematodes ” (CDFA, 1996). Efficacy is required {{to a depth of}} 5 -ft. for nursery certification. Historically, methyl bromide has been used effectively against soil pests over a range of soil types, temperature, and moistures resulting in greater flexibility of use and less risk of loss than is possible with many other soil treatments. Fumigation with 1, 3 -D can be acceptable under some field conditions, but its use is limited in California by township caps. Growers of perennial nursery crops, such as trees and vines, will need alternatives to methyl bromide in order to continue to produce clean planting material and meet CDFA’s requirements following the ban on methyl bromide.

40|$|Replant {{and decline}} {{diseases}} of grapevines not only cause {{quantitative and qualitative}} yield losses, but also result in extra costs when vineyards have to be replanted. This study investigated the role of Pythium and Phytophthora in the decline syndrome in South Africa by determining (1) the species associated with <b>nursery</b> and established <b>vines,</b> and (2) pathogenicity of Ph. sp. niederhauserii and P. vexans relative to known grapevine pathogens. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays were also developed for detection of the most prevalent oomycete groups. In total, 26 Pythium and three Phytophthora species were identified from grapevine nurseries and established vineyards. The most common infections in sampled <b>nursery</b> <b>vines</b> were caused by P. vexans (16. 7 %), followed by P. ultimum var. ultimum (15. 0 %) and P. irregulare (11. 7 %). In established vineyards, P. irregulare (18. 0 %) and P. vexans (6. 2 %) were also among the three most prevalent species, along with P. heterothallicum (7. 3 %). Three Phytophthora species were also identified from the sampled established vines, of which Ph. cinnamomi (5. 1 %) was predominant, followed by Ph. sp. niederhauserii (1. 1 %). In established vineyards a higher incidence and more diverse species composition was observed in spring and winter, than in summer. Pathogenicity studies showed that some Ph. sp. niederhauserii and P. vexans isolates were as aggressive as the known grapevine pathogens Ph. cinnamomi and P. irregulare. Sensitive qPCR assays were developed {{for the detection of}} P. ultimum var. ultimum, P. irregulare, P. vexans and the genus Phytophthora. These assays will be invaluable in limiting pathogen dispersal through screening of nursery material.

40|$|Black foot is an {{important}} disease of grapevines, affecting <b>vines</b> in <b>nurseries</b> {{as well as in}} young plantations. In recent years the disease has increased in incidence and severity throughout the world. Black foot is associated with at least two Campylocarpon and 12 Ilyonectria species, most of which have only recently been described. The recognition of previously unknown species, together with published reports of variability in virulence between and within species identified as I. macrodidyma and I. liriodendri, underlined the need to compare the virulence of isolates from these complexes. A further objective of this work was to determine the cross-infection potential of isolates of these species from other hosts to grapevine. Results from this study revealed recently described species such as I. lusitanica, I. estremocensis and I. europaea to be more virulent to grapevine than the species previously accepted as the main causal agents of black foot, such as I. liriodendri and I. macrodidyma. Furthermore, these results also provided support for isolates obtained from non-grapevine hosts to be as virulent to grapevines as isolates obtained from grapevine, underlying the cross-infection potential of these pathogens...|$|R

40|$|Based on archival {{material}} and relevant literature, this article traces {{the history of}} the Čibača Plant Nursery from its establishment in 1911 to 1932, when it was closed down. The initial purpose of setting up a nursery in Čibača, 7 km east of Dubrovnik, was to combat the spreading of grape vine disease in southern Dalmatia by producing American <b>vine</b> rootstocks. The <b>Nursery’s</b> original activity later also included the cultivation of Mediterranean plants—olives, figs, carob beans, oranges, lemons, ornamental plants and aromatic herbs. In addition, the Nursery promoted other agricultural activities, such as apiculture and sericulture, as well as the growth of tansy. From 1927 onwards, the Nursery organised agrarian courses which, unfortunately, the people ge-nerally attended only to fulfil the necessary qualifications in order to obtain the USA immigration visa. Following the initial success during Austrian rule, in the interwar Yugosla-via the Nursery stagnated due mainly to unprofessional management and poor financial support. A disease caused by Bacterium tumefaciens, coupled by political intereference in the Nursery’s operation resulted in 1932 in its closing down, the activities being relocated to Toplica near Bar in Montenegro. Despite the mentioned flaws, diversified activities of the Nursery in Čibača no doubt contributed to the agriculture of the Dubrovnik region and economic development of southern Croatia...|$|R
40|$|Dead vines {{are often}} a problem in many {{vineyards}} and are due to physiological or pathological causes whereby the vines need to be replaced. The replacement operation is a real cost for the direct costs of the plant material, for its planting and for their different management during the current year or {{in the two years}} after the replacement, determining also vineyard variability. When replacement is performed in the first years after vineyard establishment it is quite easy, whereas many issues occur when replacement is later, particularly issues considering roots competition. To reduce replacement problems, the use of “alternative plant material” has been evaluated. The “alternative vines” were one year old with a shoot length 80 - 100 cm and a shoot diameter no less than 7. 50 mm. Such plant material has higher producing costs than normal vines, but it has a shorter and easier training period. The use of “alternative vines” also can be a useful tool in varietal changing (in addition to or in replacement of the graft techniques) to obtain a moderate yield since the plantation year. In this case the cost-effectiveness should be evaluated carefully. The research conducted during the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons studied the cultivation techniques adopted in the nursery to obtaining suitable “alternative plant” with different graft combinations. Vegetative and productive parameters of “alternative vines” {{during the first year of}} planting were also evaluated. Results suggest different vineyard management compare to the traditional management. Particularly, in the <b>nursery,</b> <b>vines</b> seemed to be more vigorous when there is a greater distance in the row and foliar fertilization is applied.
