I couldn't stand for {{throwing}} together a fifteen-cent kidney stew while wearing, at the same time, a $150 house-dress, with <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace</b> insertion. So I goes into the closet and puts on the cheapest dress Mrs. Brown had bought for me--it's the one I've got on now--not so bad for $75, is it? I'd left all my own clothes in my sister's flat in Brooklyn.|$|E
60|$|It {{is as good}} as a {{coronation}} to see him and Mrs. Bumpsher go to Court. I {{wonder the}} carriage can hold them both. On those days Mrs. Bumpsher holds her own drawing-room before her Majesty's; and we are invited to come and see her sitting in state, upon the largest sofa in her rooms. She has need of a stout one, I promise you. Her very feathers must weigh something considerable. The diamonds on her stomacher would embroider a full-sized carpet-bag. She has rubies, ribbons, cameos, emeralds, gold serpents, opals, and <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace,</b> as if she were an immense sample out of Howell and James's shop.|$|E

60|$|As Bontems passed noiselessly {{across the}} room, his feet {{sinking into the}} moss-like carpet, there was the heavy close smell of sleep in the air, and he could near the long thin {{breathing}} of the sleeper. He passed through the opening in the rails, and stood, watch in hand, waiting for the exact instant when the iron routine of the court demanded that the monarch should be roused. Beneath him, from under the costly green coverlet of Oriental silk, half buried in the fluffy <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace</b> which edged the pillow, there protruded a round black bristle of close-cropped hair, with {{the profile of a}} curving nose and petulant lip outlined against the white background. The valet snapped his watch, and bent over the sleeper.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{must get}} Mrs Brooke {{to tell you}} how to fix your things. She was very kind to me. I had a green silk, and it looked so cheap and horrid {{by the side of the}} nice dresses here I felt {{regularly}} unhappy about it, and asked her how much a dress like one Mrs Laurence had would cost. That looked so simple and elegant I thought it wouldn't be costly; but it was India mull and <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace,</b> so, of course, I couldn't have it. Then Mrs Brooke said: [...] "Get some muslin to cover the green silk, and wear hops or some white flowers, instead of pink, in your hair, and you will have a pretty suit." [...] Isn't it lovely and becoming?' And Miss Burton surveyed herself with girlish satisfaction; for a little taste had softened the harsh green, and hop-bells became her red hair better than roses.|$|E
60|$|The carpet was {{of white}} velvet--(laid over several webs of Aubusson, Ispahan, and Axminster, {{so that your}} foot gave no more sound as it trod upon the {{yielding}} plain than the shadow did which followed you)--of white velvet, painted with flowers, arabesques, and classic figures, by Sir William Ross, J. M. W. Turner, R. A., Mrs. Mee, and Paul Delaroche. The edges were wrought with seed-pearls, and fringed with <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace</b> and bullion. The walls were hung with cloth of silver, embroidered with gold figures, over which were worked pomegranates, polyanthuses, and passion-flowers, in ruby, amethyst, and smaragd. The drops of dew which the artificer had sprinkled on the flowers were diamonds. The hangings were overhung by pictures yet more costly. Giorgione the gorgeous, Titian the golden, Rubens the ruddy and pulpy (the Pan of Painting), some of Murillo's beatified shepherdesses, who smile on you out of darkness like a star, a few score first-class Leonardos, and fifty of the master-pieces of the patron of Julius and Leo, the Imperial genius of Urbino, covered {{the walls of the}} little chamber. Divans of carved amber covered with ermine went round the room, and in the midst was a fountain, pattering and babbling with jets of double-distilled otto of roses.|$|E

There is {{one more}} reason, very {{different}} from the preceding, which tends to make Geneva famous, and to draw travellers to visit it at the present day; and that is, it is a great manufacturing place for watches and jewelry--one of the greatest, indeed, in the world. Travellers, in making the tour of Europe,--and American travellers in particular,--always wish to bring home with them a great number and variety of purchases; and the things that they buy they very naturally desire to buy at the places where they are made. It is not merely that they hope to get them better and cheaper there, but it is a pleasant thought to be associated always afterwards with any object of use or luxury that we possess, that we bought it ourselves at the place of its original manufacture. Thus the gentlemen who travel in Europe like to bring home a fowling-piece from Birmingham, a telescope from London, or a painting from Italy; and the ladies, in planning their tour, wish it to include Brussels or <b>Valenciennes</b> for <b>laces,</b> and Geneva for a watch.|$|R
60|$|This latter {{document}} {{was a great}} puzzle to our friends, who, on reflecting that its bewildering categories took account of breakfast alone, had the uneasy prevision of an encyclopedic dinner-list. They found copious diversion at their inn, an enormous wooden structure for the erection of which it struck them the virgin forests of the West must have been quite laid waste. It was perforated {{from end to end}} with immense bare corridors, through which a strong draught freely blew, bearing along wonderful figures of ladies in white morning-dresses and clouds of <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace,</b> who floated down the endless vistas on expanded furbelows very much as angels spread their wings. In front was a gigantic verandah on which an army might have encamped—a vast wooden terrace with a roof as high as the nave of a cathedral. Here our young men enjoyed, as they supposed, a glimpse of American society, which was distributed over the measureless expanse in a variety of sedentary attitudes and appeared to consist largely of pretty young girls, dressed as for a fête champêtre, swaying to and fro in rocking-chairs, fanning themselves with large straw fans and enjoying an enviable exemption from social cares. Lord Lambeth had a theory, which it might be interesting to trace to its origin, that it would be not only agreeable, but easily possible, to enter into relations with one of these young ladies; and his companion found occasion to check his social yearning.|$|E

50|$|This {{ground is}} used in <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace</b> {{is a type}} of {{bobbin lace}} which {{originated}} in Valenciennes, in the Nord département of France, and flourished from about 1705 to 1780. Later production moved to Belgium in and around Ypres. The industry continued onto the 19th century on a diminished scale. By the 19th century <b>valenciennes</b> <b>lace</b> could be made by machine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace</b> {{received}} an impetus {{in the seventeenth}} century, when the Scheldt was channelled for river navigation between Cambrai and Valenciennes, benefiting the export of Valenciennes' wool, fabric and fine arts. To use up flax yarn, women began to make the famous <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace.</b> Early <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace</b> was grounded with fancy mesh which was thicker and closer than the open réseau used later. The more open version was developed in Valenciennes, and thus the type of lace became known {{under the name of}} the town. The open mesh started to evolve in the 18th century and by the 19th century the characteristic ground made of four braided threads was in use. By the 1900s little of the famous lace was still made in Valenciennes.|$|E
50|$|In 1844, {{a machine}} was {{patented}} that made <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace</b> and black silk Chantilly lace that {{was difficult to}} distinguish from the handmade lace.|$|E
50|$|Mechlin lace {{is known}} for its rich floral patterns, fine twisted-and-plaited, {{hexagonal}} ground, and its outlined designs. It looks much like Brussels lace, however it is made all at once, with the réseau or ground made {{at the same time as}} the pattern on the pillow. Also, the plait is shorter, and the mesh smaller than those of Brussels lace. All Mechlin laces are outlined with a loosely spun silk cord used to define the pattern, whereas <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace</b> isn't. Mechlin lace is also more expensive than <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace,</b> as it takes more time to make because of the different réseau.|$|E
50|$|<b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace</b> is {{made on a}} lace pillow in one piece, {{with the}} réseau (the net-like ground) being made {{at the same time}} as the toilé (the pattern). It differentiates itself from other types of lace because the {{openness}} of the réseau, the closeness and evenness of the toilé, which resembles cambric, and that it lacks any cordonnet (a loosely spun silk cord used to outline and define the pattern). Also, in real Flemish <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace</b> there are no twisted sides to the mesh; all are closely plaited, and as a rule the shape of the mesh is diamond but without the openings.|$|E
50|$|To {{celebrate}} its 50th {{anniversary in}} 2004, La Perla {{put together a}} collection made with <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace,</b> produced on ancient mechanic looms of Calais, the most important Leavers lace centre in the world.|$|E
50|$|The bride wore {{a wedding}} gown of <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace,</b> with {{matching}} veil and train, designed by John Cavanagh with the City of London diamond fringe tiara. Angus Ogilvy declined the Queen's offer {{to be created}} an earl upon marriage, so their children carry no titles.|$|E
5000|$|The term gimp with {{reference}} to lace refers to the thread {{that is used to}} outline the pattern. This thread is normally thicker than that used to make the lace. It gives definition and slightly raises the edge of the design. A gimp thread is used widely in many laces, with notable exceptions being Binche lace and <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1591, the Jesuits built {{a school}} and then the {{foundations}} of a church of Sainte-Croix. In 1611, the façade of the town hall was completely rebuilt in magnificent Renaissance style.

50|$|Lille lace was {{a type of}} {{bobbin lace}} that was made at Lille, also known as Rijsel. It was a {{lightweight}} lace popular {{in the eighteenth century}} in both black and white. It lacked the rich designs of <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace.</b> Its quality declined after the French Revolution, and by 1800 it was worn only by 'the most ordinary women'. In {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century the sketch-line designs, made only of gimp, were enclosed by a cloudy fond simple, relieved only by a scattering of tiny dots (point d'esprit). After the French Revolution of 1848, little was made commercially.|$|E
50|$|In 1764, a {{profound}} change {{was made to}} the stocking frame that enabled it to produce weft-knitted nets. Hammond, the attributed inventor, used ticklers to stitch-transfer from one needle to the third one along crossing over two intermediate needles creating a cross stitch. He also used a tickler to move two stitches two to the right, and then two to the left in a double cross stitch, <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace.</b> To do this the tickler bar was detached from the frame and attached to 'dogs', that is, jointed arms. This allowed forward motion to scoop, and sideways motion to shog. New inventions were patented: Frost's tickler net of 1769, the two plain net of 1777 and the square net of 1781, and their patents were fiercely defended. Harvey changed {{the shape of the}} tickler wires to avoid one in his pin machine. This became popular in Lyon and Paris where 2000 frames were in use in 1800.|$|E
50|$|Tradition {{says that}} Binche lace {{was started in}} the 15th century by lacemakers that moved to Binche from Ghent with Mary of Burgundy, however {{there is no proof}} for this legend. However, Binche lace was being made {{by the end of the}} 16th century. In 1585, when the river Scheldt was closed to shipping, Binche did not suffer a decline in its lacemaking as did others up the river such as Antwerp lace. Binche lace was the subject of a royal edict in 1686, which implies that the lace must have been fairly important. The heyday of Binche lace was in the 18th century, when it was popular in Parisian circles. It began to die out at the end of the 18th century, and was not made much during or after the 19th century. In 1862 Victor Hugo {{mentioned}} Binche lace as the material of Cosette's wedding gown in Les Misérables, as he remembered it from his youth as being a lace of great beauty. The quality of Binche lace declined at the end of the 18th century, with the lace becoming coarser and the patterns less detailed. Originally Binche lace resembled <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace.</b>|$|E
50|$|Within a decade, Hartnell again {{effectively}} {{changed the}} fashionable evening dress silhouette, when {{more of the}} crinoline dresses worn by the Queen during the State Visit to Paris in July 1938 also created a worldwide sensation viewed {{in the press and}} on news-reels. The death of the Queen's mother Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, wife of the Earl of Strathmore, before the visit resulted in court mourning and a short delay in the dates of the visit to a vital British Ally, of enormous political significance at a time when Germany was threatening war in Europe. Royal Mourning dictated black, and shades of mauve, which meant that all the clothes utilising colour for the planned June Visit had to be re-made and Hartnell's work-rooms worked long hours to create a new wardrobe in white, which Hartnell remembered had a precedent in British Royal Mourning and was not unknown for a younger Queen. The designs featured some lavish use of detail, such as the courtesy shown to France with a day dress of yards of <b>Valenciennes</b> <b>lace,</b> day ensembles trimmed with white fox and the magnificent satin crinoline dress, the ruched decoration highlighted by camellias, worn for a Gala at the Opera and seen to effect on Garnier's impressive staircase. Hartnell was decorated by the French government and his friend Christian Dior, creator of the full-skirted post-war New Look, was not immune to the influence and romance of the look. He publicly stated that whenever he thought of beautiful clothes, it was of those created by Hartnell for the 1938 State Visit, which he viewed as a young aspirant in the fashion world. The crinoline fashion for evening wear influenced fashion internationally and French designers were not slow to take up the influence of the Scottish-born Queen and the many kilted Scots soldiers in Paris for the State Visit; day clothes featuring plaids or tartans were evident in the next seasons collections of many Parisian designers.|$|E
