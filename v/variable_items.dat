50|$|CMUCPP was {{authorized}} in IFRS in the IASB's original Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, Par. 104 (a) in 1989. In {{terms of the}} original Framework, (1989) Par 104 (a) accountants choose CMUCPP to implement a financial capital concept of invested purchasing power, i.e. financial CMUCPP {{at all levels of}} inflation and deflation instead of the traditional HC concept of invested money. They thus implement a CPP financial capital maintenance concept by measuring financial capital maintenance in units of CPP instead of traditional HC nominal monetary units and they implement a CPP profit/loss determination concept in units of CPP instead of in real value eroding nominal monetary units under HCA. Examples of constant items are issued share capital, retained income, capital reserves, all other items in shareholders´ equity, trade debtors, trade creditors, provisions, deferred tax assets and liabilities, all other non-monetary payables, all other non-monetary receivables, salaries, wages, rentals, all other items in the income statement, etc. Examples of <b>variable</b> <b>items</b> are property, plant, equipment, listed and unlisted shares, inventory, foreign exchange, etc. <b>Variable</b> <b>items</b> are valued in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) at for example fair value, market value, recoverable value, present value, net realizable value, etc. or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) during non-hyperinflationary periods.|$|E

It is not low inflation, high inflation or hyperinflation doing the eroding. It is the implementation of the stable measuring unit assumption during low inflation, high inflation and hyperinflation. Constant real value non-monetary items are measured in units of CPP in terms of a daily rate at all levels of inflation and deflation. Monetary items are inflation-adjusted daily.

5000|$|Constant {{purchasing}} power accounting is an accounting model {{approved by the}} International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) {{as an alternative to}} traditional historical cost accounting under hyper-inflationary environments.) Under this system, financial capital maintenance is measured in units of constant {{purchasing power}} (CPP) in terms of a Daily CPI (consumer price index) during low inflation and deflation. It can also be measured in a monetized daily indexed unit of account (e.g. the Unidad de Fomento in Chile) and in terms of a daily relatively stable foreign currency parallel rate or daily index during high inflation and hyperinflation. The stable measuring unit assumption is never implemented under CMUCPP. CMUCPP implements financial CMUCPP - as originally authorized in IFRS in the Framework (1989), Par 104 (a) Conceptual Framework (2010), Par 4.59 (a) which states: [...] "Financial capital maintenance can be measured in either nominal monetary units or units of CPP" [...] {{as an alternative to the}} 3000-year-old generally accepted globally implemented traditional historical cost accounting (HCA) model - with differentiated variable and constant real value non-monetary items in terms of a Daily CPI which automatically maintains the real value of capital constant for an indefinite period of time in all entities that at least break even in real value at all levels of inflation and deflation - ceteris paribus. Net constant item losses and gains are calculated and accounted whenever constant items are not measured in units of CPP. Variable real value non-monetary items are valued in terms of IFRS and then updated daily in terms of the Daily CPI. Historical <b>variable</b> <b>items</b> are updated in terms of the Daily CPI because there is no stable measuring unit assumption under CMUCPP. Monetary items - except current period items - are inflation-adjusted in terms of the Daily CPI since the stable measuring unit assumption is rejected under CMUCPP.

It examines the commentaries on three variable usage items (-ise/-ize spellings, alright v. all right, and data in singular/plural agreement) in dictionaries, style manuals and usage guides published in Australia and Britain from 1966 to 1995. The treatment of each usage item in terms of prescription/proscription or acceptance is then compared with quantitative evidence of actual usage, using (a) a set of standard corpora (Australian and British) from 1966 to 1995, and (b) twenty-first century data from the internet (Google searches of Australian and UK sites). Changes in relative frequencies of the variants for each pair are then analysed as reflections of the standardization process and/or the putative hyperstandardizing influence of usage commentaries. Despite markedly different treatments in Australian and British references, the trends for the three variable usage items in twenty-first century English are found to be much the same.

In Experiment 1 we taught adult participants an artificial language containing unpredictable variation in 1 grammatical feature. We manipulated the amount of inconsistency {{and the meaning of}} the inconsistent item. Postexposure testing showed that participants learned the language, including the variable item, despite the presence of inconsistency.

As in Experiment 1, the adults did not regularize the language. However, many children did regularize the language, imposing patterns that were not the same as their input. These results suggest that children and adults do not learn from variable input in the same way. Moreover, they suggest that children may play a unique and important role in creole formation by regularizing grammatical patterns...|$|E

Methods From 2009 to 2014 data about laparoscopic (LAP) and robotic (ROB) assisted colorectal cancer procedures performed in General Surgery, University Hospital of Pisa were collected. Operating time and length of stay were evaluated as surgical parameters and costs included fixed and <b>variable</b> <b>items.</b> Amortised cost of the robot and laparoscopic instrument and amortised cost of robot maintenance per intervention were considered among fixed costs. Variable costs included costs of dispensable equipment, cost of operating room personnel per time and costs of length-of-stay. Over the 5 -years period surgical parameters and costs associated with LAP and ROB were analysed using descriptive statistics and compared between groups by independent T-test and Mann-Whitney test. Generalized linear models {{were used to assess}} the independent effect of type of surgery and time. Results A total of 25 laparoscopic (LAP) and 50 robotic (ROB) procedures were evaluated. Overall median operating time was significantly higher in LAP (270 min vs 312. 5 min, P= 0. 006) and regression analysis showed a borderline significant interaction effect between type of surgery and years (P= 0. 058) suggesting a significant reduction of operating time in ROB but not in LAP. Hospital-stay did not differ between groups (P= 0. 567). Overall mean costs associated to LAP varied between 8, 612 ± 2, 733 Euros in 2009 to 10, 827 ± 5, 038 Euros in 2013. For ROB mean costs were 12, 966 ± 1, 115 Euros in 2010 to 11, 933 ± 1, 753 Euros in 2014.

Abstract: Increasingly, tourism {{has been}} {{recognised}} as playing a substantial role in several developing economies, {{including that of}} Zimbabwe, despite the political instability that has been experienced by the country in recent times. The purpose {{of this research was}} to examine the perceptions of residents towards the impacts of tourism development in Bulawayo. The resident perceptions towards tourism impact were measured by means of a 5 -point Likert-type scale comprised of 38 <b>variable</b> <b>items</b> that were classified into 8 constructs (positive economic impacts; negative economic impacts; positive sociocultural impacts; negative sociocultural impacts; positive environmental impacts; negative environmental impacts; evaluation of tourism impacts; and general impacts). A questionnaire survey was used to target n = 384 residents with the aid of trained fieldworkers, using a stratified random sampling technique. The data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. Overall, in terms of profile, the study found a higher proportion of women than men, within the age range of 18 to 85 years old. Most had lived for between 10 to 40 years in Bulawayo. They were mostly married and, besides English, were found to speak both Ndebele and Shona, being indigenous languages of the country. The study revealed that the respondents were engaged in low-income jobs, despite the majority of them being relatively well-educated. Very few of them work in the tourism sector and are involved in the planning/decision-making in tourism in their area. Consequently, their understanding of what tourism constitutes, and their knowledge of the subject, can be described as fair. Overall, their perceptions were found to be positive, although a few areas of concern did emerge. Administration of the statistical test for difference, in terms of the demographic variables and the perception items, revealed significant statistical differences and similarities. The study makes a significant contribution towards existing scholarship analysing resident perceptions of tourism in the Zimbabwean context...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Despite various {{international}} efforts initiated to improve maternal health, {{more than half}} a million women worldwide die each year as a result of complications arising from pregnancy and childbirth. This research was guided by the following questions: 1) How does women's autonomy influence the choice of place of delivery in resource-poor urban settings? 2) Does its effect vary by household wealth? and 3) To what extent does women's autonomy mediate the relationship between women's education and use of health facility for delivery? Methods The data used is from a maternal health study carried out in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya. A total of 1, 927 women (out of 2, 482) who had a pregnancy outcome in 2004 – 2005 were selected and interviewed. Seventeen <b>variable</b> <b>items</b> on autonomy were used to construct women's decision-making, freedom of movement, and overall autonomy. Further, all health facilities serving the study population were assessed with regard to the number, training and competency of obstetric staff; services offered; physical infrastructure; and availability, adequacy and functional status of supplies and other essential equipment for safe delivery, among others. A total of 25 facilities were surveyed. Results While household wealth, education and demographic and health covariates had strong relationships with place of delivery, the effects of women's overall autonomy, decision-making and freedom of movement were rather weak. Among middle to least poor households, all three measures of women's autonomy were associated with place of delivery, and in the expected direction; whereas among the poorest women, they were strong and counter-intuitive. Finally, the study showed that autonomy may not be a major mediator of the link between education and use of health services for delivery. Conclusion The paper argues in favor of broad actions to increase women's autonomy both as an end and as a means to facilitate improved reproductive health outcomes. It also supports the call for more appropriate data that could further support this line of action. It highlights the need for efforts to improve households' livelihoods and increase girls' schooling to alter perceptions of the value of skilled maternal health care. </p...|$|E
