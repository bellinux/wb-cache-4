5|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>flight</b> {{rules on}} the river {{corridors}} by Manhattan {{have been subject to}} considerable debate since the 2006 New York City plane crash, in which New York Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle crashed into an apartment building while flying using <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> rules on the East River. This was the first aircraft collision over the Hudson River since 1976.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation was}} carried out by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB, precursor to the NTSB). It emerged that pilot Roger Peterson had over four years of flying experience, of which one with Dwyer Flying Service, and had accumulated 711 flying hours, of which 128 on Bonanzas. He had also logged 52 hours of instrument flying training, although had passed only his written examination, and was not yet qualified to operate in weather that required flying solely by reference to instruments. He and Dwyer Flying Service itself were certified to operate only under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> rules, which essentially require that the pilot must be able to see where he is going. However, {{on the night of the}} accident, <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> would have been virtually impossible due to the low clouds, the lack of a visible horizon, and the absence of ground lights over the sparsely populated area.|$|E
5|$|After a {{telephone}} discussion with a Casper weather briefer, Reid {{decided to take}} off despite the worsening conditions at the airport, {{and to try to}} escape the poor weather by turning immediately eastward. He decided to file a <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> rules (VFR) flight plan, and depart under VFR, to be better able to cope with the heavy weather in his immediate takeoff path and the vicinity of the airport.|$|E
50|$|In Israel and Palestine, for example, VFR {{does not}} exist. All <b>visual</b> <b>flights</b> must be {{performed}} under CVFR rules.|$|R
50|$|The Kraguj P-2 was {{intended}} for close ground force support, and {{could be used for}} training of pilots in <b>visual</b> day/night <b>flights,</b> aiming, missile firing and bombing of ground targets.|$|R
50|$|The {{accident}} occurred just as passenger airline {{service was}} developing in the United States. To control public perceptions that air travel was unsafe, the CAB Chairman Donald Nyrop visited the crash scene on January 1, 1952 and reassured {{the public that}} the crash had not been caused by a mechanical failure of the airplane. The loss of Flight 44-2 also led to new airline safety rules. The CAB issued a draft regulation on March 10, 1952, requiring that night <b>visual</b> <b>flights</b> on passenger planes in large aircraft be conducted only on designated routes and between airports equipped with radio communications.|$|R
5|$|Aviation {{interests}} {{have their own}} set of weather maps. One type of map shows where VFR (<b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> rules) are in effect and where IFR (instrument flight rules) are in effect. Weather depiction plots show ceiling height (level where {{at least half the}} sky is covered with clouds) in hundreds of feet, present weather, and cloud cover. Icing maps depict areas where icing can be a hazard for flying. Aviation-related maps also show areas of turbulence.|$|E
5|$|For pilots, {{knowledge}} of the sky cover helps determine if <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> rules (VFR) are being met. Knowing the degree of cloud cover can help {{determine whether or not}} various weather fronts, such as cold fronts or warm fronts, have passed by a location. A nephanalysis, contouring areas that are cloudy with scalloped lines, can be performed to indicate a system's cloud and precipitation pattern. This technique is rarely performed nowadays, due to the prevalence of satellite imagery worldwide.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{indication}} that the aircraft's Ballistic Recovery Systems emergency parachute, designed to bring the small plane down safely, was deployed. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said the plane circled the Statue of Liberty before flying north up the East River and disappeared from radar near the Queensboro Bridge. The FAA confirmed that the plane was flying under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> rules (VFR) and had attracted no special attention from air traffic controllers or NORAD before the crash. The aircraft took a hard U-shaped turn before it hit the building.|$|E
50|$|Home based {{simulators}} {{have been}} a common training aid for private pilots for many years. Recently the increased power of home PCs and improvements in graphics and simulation technology has opened up further opportunities to utilize a PC as a training aid. In fact, it's now quite easy to achieve a very high-fidelity training experience in your own living room using off-the-shelf commercial products. While early simulators allowed instrument approaches to be practiced, with photographic scenery add ins pilots can now practice <b>visual</b> <b>flights</b> and navigation.

5000|$|The airport resides at an {{elevation}} of 3714 ft above mean sea level. It has one runway with a paved surface measuring 800 x 30 m. The runway is unlit and cannot accept <b>visual</b> night <b>flight</b> rules, nor instrument flight rules.|$|R
50|$|State Highway 1 to {{the east}} and State Highway 46 {{to the north of the}} {{mountain}} each received up to 5 cm of ash cover, and were closed until the following morning due to ash and low visibility. A layer of ash 10-15 mm thick settled on farmland 5 to 10 km east of Mount Tongariro. Particle sizes were between 2 and 3mm. The airspace within a 12 km radius of the mountain was closed after the eruption, but later reopened to <b>visual</b> <b>flights</b> only. Air New Zealand cancelled some flights in and out of Rotorua, Taupo, Gisborne, Napier, Wanganui and Palmerston North due to the risk of volcanic ash clogging the engines on their aircraft serving those airports.|$|R
5|$|Flight 706 had {{departed}} Los Angeles just after 6pm, on route to Seattle, with scheduled stopovers in Salt Lake City, Utah; Boise, Idaho; Lewiston, Idaho; Pasco, Washington and Yakima, Washington. The F-4 Phantom was arriving at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro near Irvine from Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada. The F-4 pilot and all 49 {{passengers and crew}} aboard the civilian airliner died in the collision over the San Gabriel Mountains, near Duarte. Only the Radar Intercept Officer of the F-4 survived. The crash of RW 706 prompted the US Armed Forces to agree to both {{reduce the number of}} military aircraft operating under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> rules in civilian air corridors, and to require military aircraft to contact civilian air traffic controllers.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set in}} a {{reproduction}} of 11,000 square miles of the San Francisco Bay Area. The player may land at or takeoff from the area's 46 airports. Weather conditions such as rain, wind and fog are simulated. Players share the game's airspace with up to 600 artificially intelligent (AI) planes, which fly and respond to the player in real-time. Real-time air traffic control (ATC) directs the player and the AI planes to prevent collisions. The player interacts with the ATC and with other planes by constructing radio messages with a menu. Three cockpit views are available: IFR (instrument flight rules), which allows the player to monitor and interact with all flight instruments; VFR (<b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> rules), which features a larger windshield area but fewer flight instruments; and Virtual Cockpit View, which allows free look but features no interactive flight instruments. External camera angles are also available, and the player may ride as a passenger in any AI plane.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that Kennedy fell victim to spatial disorientation while descending over water at night and consequently {{lost control of the}} aircraft. Kennedy did not hold an instrument rating and was therefore only certified to fly under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> rules. However, {{at the time of the}} accident the weather and light conditions were such that all basic landmarks were obscured, making <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> challenging, although legally still permissible.|$|E

5000|$|Shirley Barrett's {{first feature}} Love Serenade “was {{inspired}} by her many visits {{to a small}} town called Robinvale in Victoria.” She embarked on the scriptwriting process {{to make a film}} that explored, “how women can get completely the wrong idea about some men.” Not only was her film inspired by the small town of Robinvale where her husband had grown up but also, “from diaries written in her late teens.” Love Serenade was shot almost entirely on location in Robinvale and is about two young sisters whose lives are changed when an “aging hippie deejay” arrives in their desolate town. The film humorously incorporates [...] "small town constrictions with <b>visual</b> <b>flights</b> of fancy". The sisters are played by Miranda Otto and Rebecca Frith and George Shevtsov stars as the washed up deejay. The deejay, who represents the “sleazy older man archetype,” is punished by death in the end “for sleeping with the two desperate sisters.” The film’s reception was varied but those who applauded Shirley’s work saw the film as “one of the most striking, fully formed and assured debuts in years.” ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{introduce}} a framework {{to predict the}} landing behaviour of a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) from {{the appearance of the}} landing surface. We approach this problem by learning a mapping from visual texture observed from an onboard camera to the landing behaviour on a set of sample materials. In this case we exemplify our framework by predicting the yaw angle of the MAV after landing. Our framework demonstrates the applicability of established texture classification methods usually tested on stationary camera setups for the more challenging case of textures observed from a MAV. Results for supervised training demonstrate good estimation of the landing behaviour and motivate future work to implement autonomous decision making strategies and other behaviour predictions based on imagery. motion traces energy accuracy motion summaries training <b>flights</b> <b>visual</b> data descriptors actual <b>flight</b> <b>visual</b> data descriptor I...|$|R
