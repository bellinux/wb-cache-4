Push broaching machines are similar to an arbor press with a guided ram; typical capacities are 5 to 50 tons. The two ram pull-down machine {{is the most common}} type of broaching machine. This style machine has the rams under the table. Pull-up machines have the ram above the table; they usually have more than one ram. Most surface broaching is done on a vertical machine.|$|E
500|$|Broaching {{machines}} are relatively simple as {{they only have}} to move the broach in a linear motion at a predetermined speed and provide a means for handling the broach automatically. Most {{machines are}} hydraulic, but a few specialty machines are mechanically driven. The machines are distinguished by whether their motion is horizontal or vertical. The choice of machine is primarily dictated by the stroke required. <b>Vertical</b> <b>broaching</b> machines rarely have a stroke longer than [...]|$|E

A rotary table and a Y axis are the cusomary axes available. Some machines will cut to a depth on the Y axis and index the rotary table automatically. The largest gears are produced on these machines.|$|R

Work process and defect about structure of escort mechanism in existence is firstly analyzed in depth, design concept and implementation methods of the new escort mechanism are then studied. Three-dimensional structure and work process are presented, and performance comparison between the new-style structure and the old one is conducted. Application study is launched at last. The innovative escort mechanism and slide board are movably connected and lumped together. In consequence, the escort mechanism will stop and then be hung at the column, while the tool slide continues to move down until broaching stop. The new-style escort mechanism has superiority such as low cost, high robust and good safety, and so on, which make it adaptive and useful for structural optimization of broaching machine.

For {{the general}} {{broaching}} machine’s problems of structure bulkiness, poor cylinder synchronization, lack of optimization design, low-grade control system, low efficiency and operational reliability, the paper studied the structural optimization {{technology of the}} large-scale high-performance CNC <b>vertical</b> <b>broaching</b> machine, designed the new 360 -degree high-load lateral rotary table, the axial-rotary multi-pass joint of the anti-leakage and the elastic-contact, and the modular slider rails, so as to improve the mechanical performance, the working stability and reliability. The remote network intelligent monitoring system and the multi-function data acquisition processor for the developed CNC broaching machine, realize the enterprise management information, the enterprise resource optimization, and the automation and intelligence of the manufacturing process...|$|E
