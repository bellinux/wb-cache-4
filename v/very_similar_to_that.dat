5|$|Hippopotamus lemerlei bones {{have been}} mostly {{discovered}} in the rivers and lakes of western Madagascar, suggesting a riparian lifestyle, <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the modern hippopotamus of modern Africa. H. lemerlei also shared the high-orbits that {{make it easier for}} the hippopotamus to see while in the water. The skull of H. lemerlei also resembled that of the modern hippopotamus, but with consistent size differences, indicating that H. lemerlei was a sexually dimorphic species.|$|E
5|$|Kingdoms—roughly {{the size}} of commanderies—were ruled {{exclusively}} by the emperor's male relatives as semi-autonomous fiefdoms. Before 157 BC some kingdoms were ruled by non-relatives, granted to them {{in return for their}} services to Emperor Gaozu. The administration of each kingdom was <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the central government. Although the emperor appointed the Chancellor of each kingdom, kings appointed all the remaining civil officials in their fiefs.|$|E

5|$|One man in {{the village}} could {{accurately}} mimic the sound of many animals, and when asked to imitate the kilopilopitsofy, he made noises <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of a hippopotamus, {{even though he had}} never left the island and said he had never seen an African hippo. When shown photos, others also identified a hippopotamus-like animal, but with larger ears. Several described the creature's last appearance in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Peléan eruptions are {{characterized}} most prominently by the incandescent pyroclastic flows that they drive. The mechanics of a Peléan eruption are <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of a Vulcanian eruption, except that in Peléan eruptions the volcano's structure {{is able to}} withstand more pressure, hence the eruption occurs as one large explosion rather than several smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|The hemmema's {{design was}} <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the turuma. The primary {{difference}} was that the turuma's oarsmen sat on the weather deck above the guns, whereas the hemmema's oarsmen sat on the gundeck. The later hemmemas were considerably larger, more heavily armed, and of a more robust construction. Glete has described them as variations on the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs.|$|E

Unlike the Verreaux's sifaka, group sex ratios are more evenly balanced, consisting {{of two or more}} members of both sexes. Females are dominant within the group, and only one female breeds successfully each season. Males will roam between groups during the mating season.|$|E
5|$|After the First Crusade, Crusaders who did {{not return}} to their homes in Europe helped found the Crusader states of the Principality of Antioch, the County of Edessa, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the County of Tripoli. The castles they founded to secure their {{acquisitions}} were designed mostly by Syrian master-masons. Their design was <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of a Roman fort or Byzantine tetrapyrgia which were square in plan and had square towers at each corner that did not project much beyond the curtain wall. The keep of these Crusader castles would have had a square plan and generally be undecorated.|$|E
5|$|In larval lampreys, {{the thyroid}} {{originates}} as an exocrine gland, secreting its hormones into the gut, and {{associated with the}} larva's filter-feeding apparatus. In the adult lamprey, the gland separates from the gut, and becomes endocrine, but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of the thyroid. For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the tunicates and Amphioxus, have a structure <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of larval lampreys (the endostyle), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds (albeit not thyroxine).|$|E

5|$|Limusaurus {{has several}} {{features}} of the head in common with basal theropods such as other ceratosaurs and coelophysoids, but it also convergently shares a number of traits, including the beak and the fused sternum, with the later coelurosaurs. The overall aspect of the animal, including the long neck and legs, is <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the Cretaceous ornithomimid theropods, {{as well as the}} Triassic non-dinosaurian archosaur Effigia, representing a significant case of convergent evolution among these three distinct groups of archosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Long {{thought to}} be related to frigatebirds, cormorants, tropicbirds, gannets and boobies, {{pelicans}} instead are now known to be most closely related to the shoebill and hamerkop, and are placed in the order Pelecaniformes. Ibises, spoonbills, herons and the desolate bitterns have been classified in the same order. Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back to at least 30 million years to the remains of a beak <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of modern species recovered from Oligocene strata in France. They are thought to have evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas; this is reflected in the relationships within the genus as the eight species divide into Old World and New World lineages.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's cuisine {{reflects}} the multi-ethnic makeup of its population. Many cultures {{from within the}} country and from surrounding regions have greatly influenced the cuisine. Much of the influence comes from the Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese, and Sumatran cultures, {{largely due to the}} country being part of the ancient spice route. The cuisine is <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of Singapore and Brunei, and also bears resemblance to Filipino cuisine. The different states have varied dishes, and often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes.|$|E

It is similar in tensile strength to nylon and biological materials such as chitin, collagen and cellulose, but is much more elastic. In other words, it can stretch much further before breaking or losing shape.|$|E
5|$|The Layer Pyramid (known locally in Arabic as el haram el midawwar, , meaning 'rubble-hill pyramid') is {{a ruined}} step pyramid {{dating to the}} 3rd Dynasty of Egypt (2686 BC to 2613 BC) and located in the {{necropolis}} of Zawyet El Aryan. Its ownership is uncertain and may be attributable to pharaoh Khaba. The pyramid architecture, however, is <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the Buried Pyramid of king Sekhemkhet {{and for this reason}} is firmly datable to the 3rd Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The cheetah {{is often}} {{confused}} with the leopard and the cougar and can be distinguished by its small round spots {{in contrast to the}} leopard's rosettes and the cougar's plain coat; in addition, the leopard lacks the tear streaks of the cheetah. The cougar possesses neither the tear streaks nor the spotted coat pattern of the cheetah. The serval has a form <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the cheetah but is significantly smaller. Moreover, it has a shorter tail and spots that fuse to form stripes on the back.|$|E

5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{displacement}} along the Imperial Fault was <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> observed {{for the northern}} part of the rupture during the 1940 El Centro earthquake, although on this occasion the rupture did not extend across the border into Mexico. This had been explained as the behavior of individual slip patches along the Imperial Fault with two patches rupturing in 1940 and only the northern one in 1979. The faulting that gave rise to the earthquake has been modeled by comparing synthetic seismograms with near-source strong motion recordings. This analysis showed that the rupture speed had at times exceeded the shear wave velocity, making this the first earthquake for which supershear rupture was inferred.|$|E
5|$|To unify all weight systems used by apothecaries, the Irish pharmacopœia of 1850 {{introduced}} a new variant of the apothecaries' system which subdivided a new apothecaries' pound of 12 avoirdupois ounces instead of the troy pound. To allow effective use of the new system, new weight pieces were produced. Since an avoirdupois ounce corresponds to 28.35g, the proposed system was <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> in use in Portugal and Spain, and in some locations in Italy. But it would have doubled {{the value of the}} avoirdupois drachm (an existing unit, but by then only used for weighing silk). Therefore, it conflicted with other non-standard variations that were based on that nearly obsolete unit.|$|E
5|$|By September 1767, all {{but four}} Jesuits {{had left the}} Chiquitania, and they went the {{following}} April. The Spanish considered it essential to maintain the settlements as a buffer against Portuguese expansion. The archbishop of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Francisco Ramón Herboso, established {{a new system of}} government, <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> set up by the Jesuits. He stipulated that each mission be run by two secular (parish) priests, one {{to take care of the}} spiritual needs while the other was in charge of all other – political and economic – affairs of the mission administration. One change was that the Indians were allowed to trade. In practice, the shortage of clergy and the low quality of those appointed by the bishop – almost all of whom did not speak the language of the local peoples and in some cases had not been ordained – led to a rapid general decline of the missions. The priests also broke ethical and religious codes, appropriated the major part of the missions' income and encouraged contraband trade with the Portuguese.|$|E
