40|$|Structures {{resembling}} cyanobacterial microfossils {{from the}} ca. 3465 Ma old Apex chert of the Warrawoona Group in Western Australia have until recently been accepted as providing the oldest morphological evidence {{for life on}} Earth, and {{have been taken to}} support an early beginning for oxygen-releasing photosynthesis. Eleven species of filamentous prokaryote, principally distinguished by shape and geometry, have been put forward as meeting the criteria required of authentic Archaean microfossils. They were contrasted with other microfossils that were dismissed as either unreliable or irreproducible. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a detailed account of research recently reported by us on the type and recollected material, involving optical and electron microscopy, digital image analysis and other techniques. All previously figured holotype materials are illustrated here, and the context for all the published materials is re-evaluated. The Apex chert 'microfossils' occur near the top of a 1. 5 -km long chert dyke complex associated with major synsedimentary growth faults. Highly localised, glassy felsic tuffs erupted explosively from this and other fissures during the early stages of volcanism, and were followed by the deposition of essentially hydrothermal black and white BaSO 4 rich cherts that infiltrated the feeder dykes, underplating and dilating adjacent stratiform cherts before the start of the next volcanic cycle. The Apex chert 'microfossils' occur within multiple generations of these metalliferous hydrothermal vein cherts some 100 m down the dyke system. Comparable structures occur in associated volcanic <b>vent</b> <b>glass</b> and in hydrothermal cherts at least 1 km deep. We find no supporting evidence for a primary biological origin. We reinterpret the purported microfossil-like structures as pseudofossils that formed from the reorganization of carbonaceous matter, mainly during recrystallization from amorphous to spherulitic silica. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|A steel {{cupboard}} of {{a design}} {{proposed for the}} storage of flammable liquids {{has been subjected to}} an all-enveloping kerosine fire. The interior and contents of the cupboard rapidly reached high temperatures leading to the-collapse of one of the shelves, destruction of gauze <b>vents,</b> fracture of <b>glass</b> bottles and the ignition of their contents, and general distortion of the cupboard. Comparison with the results of earlier tests on wooden cupboards for solvents indicates that the steel cupboard tested afforded much less protection from fire to its contents. It must be expected that any simple steel cupboard even if it were of acceptable integrity would, when exposed to a similar fire, permit its contents to be heated sufficiently for flammable liquids in bottles to escape and ignite. The cupboard was designed before the is~ue of the Highly Flammable Liquid...|$|R
30|$|Large {{changes in}} the surface manifestation of {{degassing}} activity were observed from 1990 to 1999 at the summit crater of Iwodake cone of Satsuma-Iwojima volcano. During this period, a new high-temperature fumarolic area formed {{in the center of}} the crater floor and became a degassing vent with a diameter of 40 m. Altered volcanic rocks were ejected during the course of <b>vent</b> formation. Although <b>glass</b> fragments were observed in the ejected ash, the glass comes from altered Iwodake rhyolite that covers the crater floor. The highest fumarolic temperature and equilibrium temperatures of volcanic gases had a maximum of about 900 °C at the beginning of the vent formation. The flux of SO 2, measured by COSPEC, varied from 300 to 700 ton/day and correlated directly with maximum fumarole temperature. During this period, open fractures formed along the southern rim of the crater almost contemporaneously with the vent formation and {{changes in the}} nature of fumarolic discharges. The continuous and intense degassing at Satsuma-Iwojima is likely caused by volatile transport from a deep magma chamber through a convecting magma column. An increase in the magma convection rate might have caused these large changes in surface manifestations, including increase in the SO 2 flux and fumarolic temperatures, ground deformation, and the vent formation.|$|R
40|$|Glass Buttes, a Pliocene silicic {{volcanic}} complex {{within the}} High Lava Plains province of Oregon, was erupted approximately 5. 0 to 5. 8 million years ago. Geologic mapping {{revealed that the}} eastern portion of the complex is underlain by rhyolitic glass domes, flows and rare pyroclastis flows. Basalt flows are interlayered with and onlap the silicic glass. Younger basalt flows, erupted from local <b>vents,</b> overlie silicic <b>glass</b> and onlapping basalts. The eastern end of Glass Buttes is hydrothermally altered at the surface; a weak geothermal anomaly coincides with the altered areas. Alteration, localized by northwest trending normal faults, occurs primarily as opalite replacement of rhyolite glass with associated cinnabar, alunite, clay-rich vein material, hematite, and hyalite. Alteration paragenesis at the surface was defined, and physicochemical conditions during hydrothermal activity were inferred from alteration minerals and assemblages and trace element content of alteration minerals. Alteration identified in the subsurface is interpreted {{to be related to}} an older hydrothermal system. Carbonate, pyrite, quartz, and minor smectite and chlorite occur in vugs and fractures, and partially replace subsurface basalt. Abundant fine-grained disseminated pyrite occurs in permeable units. Pyrite separates from disseminations and veins within basalt and permeable glassy units contain up to 13 ppm Au. The pyrite samples are also anomalous with respect to arsenic and antimony...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} protect {{chemical}} reactors from runaway reactions, vent sizing methods, based on data obtained from adiabatic calorimetry and two-phase flow models, were built {{under the guidance of}} the DIERS (Design Institute for Emergency System Relief). Nevertheless, because of the simplifying assumptions used (mainly conservation of initial reactive mass and homogeneous vessel venting), DIERS methods often lead to unrealistically large vent areas. This is especially the case of non tempered systems (gas-generating and hybrid systems, peroxide decomposition for example). The United Nation Manual of Test and Criteria (UN) also proposes an experimental method to determine the minimum required vent area using a 10 dm 3 vessel test. The vent area is scaled up on vessel volume. Prior mass loss and two phase flow being experimentally taken into account, this method provides a more realistic vent size. This type of area to volume scale up can be conservative in the case of non tempered systems because the mass loss at small scale is more important. Nevertheless, {{due to the fact that}} the sample size is large, the UN method has the disadvantage of being time consuming, laborious and requires heavy safety precautions. This article is about the development of a new experimental vent sizing tool for non tempered system combining the advantages of DIERS method (laboratory scale) and UN method (less overconservative). This new tool consists of an extension of the adiabatic calorimeter Vent Sizing Package II (VSP 2). The reactor in which chemical runaway reaction occurs is the "VSP 2 blowdown test cell". In order to simulate the relief system the test cell is connected to a main vent line comprising of regulating valves which allow the simulation of "equivalent ideal orifice" area by volume ratios lying between 1024 and 5. 1023 m 21. A feed bleed system is also installed. The assessment of the vented mass from the test cell is done by adding at the end of the main <b>vent</b> line a <b>glass</b> column half filled with water. During the relief the chemical products are vented in the column (quench of the reaction is realised at the same time) leading to an increase in the differential pressure at the bottom of the column. The initial VSP 2 device has also been modified in terms of the rate of pressure rise and fall to allow for these kinds of blowdown experiments. This new device was tested by running the decomposition of cumene hydroperoxide in 2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 3 -pentanediol diisobutyrate which is a non tempered system. Pressure evolution and the vented mass profile obtained are presented. The influence of several parameter (A/V ratio, the initial fill level, feed bleed opening) is also observed. However, heat losses at small scale are much more important, so working in fire simulation mode is generally preferred over the adiabatic mode. This also means that the study of tempered system appears difficult. This method can not be used with initial fill level superior to 80 %. It is not adapted to violent runaway reaction (for example very concentrated peroxide solutions) ...|$|R
