5|$|In 1999, Los <b>Vipers</b> {{split into}} two factions, with Abismo Negro leading a {{splinter}} group called Los <b>Vipers</b> Extreme consisting of Electroshock, Pentagón, Shiima, El Cuervo and Mini Abismo Negro while Cibernético created a group called Los <b>Vipers</b> Primera Clase (First Class <b>Vipers).</b> After less than two months, the angle was dropped and Los <b>Vipers</b> reunited. Not long after Los <b>Vipers</b> reunited, Cibernético formed a group called Lucha Libre Latina (LLL), a group intent on taking over AAA that was inspired by World Championship Wrestling's New World Order. Los <b>Vipers</b> became a subgroup within LLL, and Negro assumed leadership of Los <b>Vipers.</b> On May 2, 1999, Negro and Electroshock teamed up to defeat Perro Aguayo and Perro Aguayo, Jr. to win the Mexican National Tag Team Championship. Los <b>Vipers</b> held the tag team title for four months before losing it to the team of Haytor and the Panther.|$|E

5|$|In their response, the Vipers' openers put on 78 runs {{together}} in just under 10 overs, before Edwards was dismissed for 24, bowled by Jodie Dibble. Suzie Bates was run out by Fran Wilson soon after for 52 from 46 balls. Georgia Adams added 15 runs {{before she was}} also run out, by Anya Shrubsole. Another good partnership, between Sara McGlashan (21*) and Lydia Greenway (17*), took the <b>Vipers</b> to their target with seven balls to spare. Taylor, who was named as player of the tournament, was the most effective bowler for the Storm, but even she could only limit the <b>Vipers</b> to six runs per over.|$|E

5|$|The Southern <b>Vipers</b> {{became the}} first WCSL champions, {{defeating}} Western Storm by seven wickets in the final. Stafanie Taylor, a West Indian overseas player for the Western Storm, was named as player of the tournament, after she finished as both the leading run-scorer and leading wicket-taker in the competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{last round}} of matches, {{featuring}} {{all three of}} the teams that had qualified for finals day, determined who went directly to the final, and who would face off first in the semi-final. The Southern <b>Vipers</b> faced the Loughborough Lightning, and batting first a team effort saw them reach 156 for 4; Bates scored 38, Sara McGlashan got 34* and Lydia Greenway 29. Despite scores in the thirties from Perry and Evelyn Jones, a strong bowling performance from the <b>Vipers,</b> in which Linsey Smith and Brindle each took three wickets, saw them to victory by 59 runs. That victory guaranteed the <b>Vipers</b> a place in the final, while the Loughborough Lightning had to face Western Storm in a semi-final. The result of the other match that day was of no consequence to the tournament; Beth Mooney scored 56 runs for the Yorkshire Diamonds, who scored 118 runs. Anya Shrubsole finished the match with five wickets for the Western Storm, taking a four–wicket maiden in the final over of the match. Storm opening batsmen Taylor and Priest shared a 101-run partnership to take their side to the brink of victory before being dismissed from subsequent deliveries, but despite two further wickets, the Storm won by six wickets with 21 balls remaining.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} hypothesis {{suggested by}} Benoit et al. involves {{some kind of}} sensory organ occupying the maxillary fossa. Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed {{on the back side}} of the maxillary fossa, which implies that the canal, carrying the trigeminal nerve, would probably have extended across the fossa, outside of the outline of the skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the fossa may have supported a specialized sensory organ analogous to the pit organ of pit <b>vipers</b> and some other snakes, or alternatively a ganglion of nerve cells. It is also possible that this organ functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit organ does in pit <b>vipers.</b> However, such an expanded sensory organ would be unprecedented among tetrapods, and the few other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary fossa either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible.|$|E

5|$|Glen Anthony Rice Jr. (born January 1, 1991) is an American {{professional}} basketball player for Hapoel Holon of the Israeli Premier League. He {{was drafted by}} the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2013 NBA draft, but he was traded on draft night to the Wizards. He formerly played college basketball for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets basketball team but was dismissed from the team during his junior season for the 2011–12 Yellow Jackets team and went pro the following season, playing {{a year for the}} Rio Grande Valley <b>Vipers</b> of the NBA Development League (D-League). He led the <b>Vipers</b> to a D-League championship in 2013. As a professional, Rice has developed a reputation as a dunker, earning an invitation to the D-League slam dunk contest and then earning two slam dunk of the day recognitions in the 2013 NBA Summer League. He was MVP of the 2014 NBA Summer League.|$|E
5|$|In the {{penultimate}} {{round of}} matches, Dane van Niekerk made the highest {{score of the}} competition, 91 runs, to propel the Loughborough Lightning to 168 for 6, the highest team total of the tournament. During the Surrey Stars' response, van Niekerk {{was also one of}} three bowlers to take two wickets to help limit the Stars to 134 runs, and secure the Lightning a place at finals days. The <b>Vipers</b> travelled to Taunton unbeated before their match against the Western Storm. Batting first, the <b>Vipers</b> reached 137 for 3; Suzie Bates scored 57 runs and Charlotte Edwards got 30. In their reply, the Western Storm lost Rachel Priest early, but two big partnership involving Stafanie Taylor, who scored 78 not out, helped them to victory with 13 balls remaining. The final match of the day pitted the two northern sides against each other in the women's 'Roses' match. Yorkshire batted first in Manchester and scored 166; Alex Blackwell got 59 runs, and a slow over-rate meant that Yorkshire received six additional runs before the final over. In Lancashire's chase, Danielle Hazell took four wickets, and Katherine Brunt took a hat-trick to bowl the Thunder out for 71 runs. That meant that Yorkshire and Lancashire had each won once during the tournament, and irrespective of results in the last round of group matches, neither could qualify for finals day; both the Southern <b>Vipers</b> and Western Storm would join the Loughborough Lightning.|$|E

5|$|The main {{criticism}} levelled at the EIHL is {{that the}} league is too expensive, an accusation given credence {{by the collapse of}} the London Racers mid season in 2005, and the continued financial problems experienced by a number of other member clubs (most notably Basingstoke Bison and Manchester Phoenix in 2008–09). Both the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle <b>Vipers</b> made public statements about their potentially perilous financial situations, casting further doubt over both their own, and the league's sustained viability.|$|E
5|$|There {{are fewer}} {{recorded}} bites from this species {{compared to other}} venomous species such as cobras and <b>vipers</b> as it is less aggressive and tends to avoid humans.
