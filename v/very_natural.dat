5|$|In September 2010, Howling Bells started {{recording}} The Loudest Engine at the Killers-owned Battle Born Studios in Las Vegas. It {{was produced}} by bassist Mark Stoermer, whom the group had met while it toured with The Killers. The relationship between Stoermer and Howling Bells strengthened after the band disembarked from its flight to Las Vegas. The flight had been delayed by more than 12 hours, but he had nonetheless waited for them at the airport. Howling Bells were impressed by his style of work. Rather than overproducing, he kept the amount of takes to a minimum and allowed the band just to play, which kept the sessions <b>very</b> <b>natural.</b> The band members became less conscious of trying to please other people, made the record that they wanted, and hoped that it would change people's attitudes toward the band.|$|E
25|$|To {{consider}} another example, where {{a rotating}} reference frame is <b>very</b> <b>natural</b> to us, namely {{the surface of the}} rotating Earth, centrifugal force reduces the apparent force of gravity by about one part in a thousand, depending on latitude. This reduction is zero at the poles, maximum at the equator.|$|E

25|$|Cold cured or cold pour dentures, {{also known}} as {{temporary}} dentures, do not look <b>very</b> <b>natural,</b> are not very durable, tend to be highly porous and are only used as a temporary expedient until a more permanent solution is found. These types of dentures are inferior and tend to cost much less due to their quick production time (usually minutes) and low cost materials. It is not suggested that a patient wear a cold cured denture {{for a long period}} of time, for they are prone to cracks and can break rather easily.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{from the}} {{impression}} that even thus the comic element needed strengthening, or from the <b>very</b> <b>natural</b> desire to provide a good part for Mr. Denny, the author has introduced, in the M'Crankie, a figure which, though wholly unnecessary {{to the development of}} the plot, and in his surprising mixture of Scottish characteristics scarcely credible in any period, will probably have as much to say to the success of the new piece as any of the characters. It is true that the absurdities of the part would be more acceptable in one of the frankly extravagant inventions of the older librettist than in a more professedly historical, and one which presents in all other respects, faithful pictures of the place and period chosen.|$|E

I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Kunis {{replaced}} Lacey Chabert in {{the role}} of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom Family Guy, created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show. When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her. MacFarlane added: [...] "What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways, I thought, almost more right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, {{but there was something about}} Mila– something <b>very</b> <b>natural</b> about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. She had a <b>very</b> <b>natural</b> quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work." [...] Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007. She also voiced Meg in the Family Guy Video Game!. Kunis described her character as [...] "the scapegoat." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's {{controls}} were well received. The D-Pad Destroyer of GamePro praised the controls as [...] "nearly-perfect" [...] {{and explained that}} [...] "the transparent controls allow you to concentrate on racing and blasting your opponents, and so the races are faster, more fluid and more fun." [...] Johnny Liu of Game Revolution concluded that the controls [...] "feel <b>very</b> <b>natural,</b> {{with an emphasis on}} maintaining speed rather than fighting lousy controls." [...] However, Joe Ottoson of Allgame ("All Game Guide" [...] at the time) said that the inability to reconfigure the controls was [...] "the only real drawback to Crashs presentation." ...|$|E

All songs are played using the five notes available on an ocarina, although by bending pitches via the analog stick, players can play additional tones. Kondo said that creating distinct themes on the limited scale was a [...] "major challenge", but feels that {{the end result is}} <b>very</b> <b>natural.</b> The popularity of Ocarina of Time led to an increase in ocarina sales.|$|E

500|$|Years later, Wintour {{admitted}} the photo {{had never been}} planned as the cover shot. In 2011, when Vogue put its entire archive online, Wintour was quoted as saying, [...] "I just said, 'Well, let's just try this.' And off we went. It was just <b>very</b> <b>natural.</b> To me it just said, 'This is something new. This is something different.' [...] The printers called {{to make sure that}} was supposed to be the cover, as they thought a mistake might have been made." [...] In 2015 she said if she had to pick a favorite of her covers, it would be that one. [...] "t was a leap of faith and it was certainly a big change for Vogue." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Some of {{the waste}} is already vitrified. There is, in my mind, no {{economical}} reason why you would ever think of pulling it back into a potential fuel cycle. So one could well imagine—again, {{it depends on what}} the blue-ribbon panel says—one could well imagine that for a certain classification for a certain type of waste, you don't want to have access to it anymore, so that means you could use different sites than Yucca Mountain, such as salt domes. Once you put it in there, the salt oozes around it. These are geologically stable for a 50 to 100 million year time scale. The trouble with those type of places for repositories is you don't have access to it anymore. But say for certain types of waste you don't want to have access to it anymore—that's good. It's a <b>very</b> <b>natural</b> containment. ...whereas there would be other waste where you say it has some inherent value, let's keep it around for a hundred years, two hundred years, because there's a high likelihood we'll come back to it and want to recover that.|$|E
500|$|John [...] "DJ" [...] Desjardin {{served as}} the visual {{supervisor}} for Man of Steel, with Weta Digital, MPC, and Double Negative providing the visual effects for the film. Zack Snyder wanted the film to [...] "appear <b>very</b> <b>natural</b> because there’s some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief, and we the visual effects team {{had to make it}} as easy as possible for them to do so." [...] Desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to utilize handheld devices to make the film feel like a [...] "documentary-style" [...] film. [...] "We had to think about what that would mean, since we also had to photograph some crazy action," [...] said Desjardin. [...] "So {{for a lot of the}} previs we did, we’d start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was. A lot of the rules are the Battlestar Galactica rules for the space cams that Gary Hurtzel [...] developed for that miniseries, where we want to make sure if we're translating the camera at all it makes sense. Unless the action is so over the top, like in the end where Superman is beating up Zod—we had to break it a bit." ...|$|E

The set featured Rihanna wearing [...] "a white sequined blazer with a little black shirt underneath and stilettos", and was joined on stage {{by a group of}} dancers, who were all dressed in black. Rihanna also gave a short interview about the album and the level of energy which was put into it, saying [...] "It came <b>very</b> <b>natural</b> only because it was my place of peace, being the studio just venting. It was the one place I didn't feel judged or criticized. Every emotion went into that album." [...] The song was also included on the set list of the Last Girl on Earth Tour (2010–11) in the encore section, as part of a medley with [...] "Live Your Life" [...] and [...] "Run This Town", before performing [...] "Umbrella" [...] as the final song. On June 24, 2012, Rihanna performed at the BBC Radio 1's Hackney Weekend. She performed [...] "Wait Your Turn" [...] as part of a set list which also included songs from her fifth and sixth sequel studio albums. The performance featured giant sphinx on the stage.|$|E
500|$|Chris Coghill {{was cast}} as Whitney's abuser Tony on 20 June 2008. Upon {{accepting}} the role, he commented: [...] "Shona doesn't act, or look, {{like a little}} child. Which helps." [...] He has added of their off-screen relationship: [...] "Shona's fantastic to work with. She's <b>very</b> <b>natural,</b> very instinctive and a natural actress. There isn't any uncomfortable feeling at all." [...] Having undergone a thorough characterisation session, Coghill began shooting on 30 June 2008, and first appeared on-screen on 12 September 2008. Coghill has explained that Tony began grooming Whitney {{as soon as he}} met Bianca, ingratiating himself so as to become the family's [...] "hero figure" [...] and [...] "saviour". Discussing his character's relationship with Whitney, Coghill explained that: [...] "The lie that Tony has spun to Whitney is that as soon as she's 16 they'll run away together and start a new life. But Tony's the type of paedophile who preys on younger children. Whitney is beginning to pass her sell-by date with him. [...] He feels like he's losing his little girl but needs to keep Whitney under his control and not speak out." [...] Coghill stated that: [...] "This is the most challenging role I have had to play. But I hope by EastEnders tackling the sensitive issue of child abuse it can raise awareness." [...] When asked how she felt about the abuse storyline, Palmer commented: [...] "It would be brilliant if it helped somebody. If one person out there who's been abused saw [...] {{go out of their way}} to make it easier on the victim – Whitney's evidence is given by video link – it will be worth it." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{explores the}} limits of [...] "English" [...] magic through the {{characters}} of Stephen Black and Vinculus. As Clarke explains, [...] "If you put a fairy next {{to a person who}} is also outside English society...suddenly {{the fact that there is}} this alien race seems more believable, because you've got another alien and the two of them can talk about the English in this <b>very</b> <b>natural</b> way." [...] The gentleman with the thistle-down hair sees Stephen as a noble savage and enslaves him—like Lady Pole, Stephen is silenced. Both [...] "suffer under a silencing spell that mimics gaps in the historical record". Furthermore, the gentleman's desire to acquire Stephen for his dancing hall is reminiscent of the English objectification of black slaves. Stephen vows to hate all white Englishmen after he discovers that they enslaved his mother, but when the gentleman shows him the hanging of the white Vinculus, he weeps. Both Strange and Norrell see the essence of Englishness in the Raven King, a character who was raised by fairies and could not speak English. As Elizabeth Hoiem explains, [...] "The most English of all Englishmen, then, is both king and slave, in many ways indistinguishable from Stephen Black. This paradox is what ultimately resolves the plot. When Strange and Norrell summon 'the nameless slave', the Raven King's powerful alliances with nature are transferred to Stephen Black, allowing Stephen to kill the Gentleman and free himself from slavery." [...] In the end, it is Strange and Norrell who are trapped in everlasting darkness while the silenced women, people of colour, and poor whites defeat the antagonist.|$|E

500|$|The {{band had}} been flooded with [...] "hyperbolic praise," [...] and deemed [...] "the next big thing" [...] by {{multiple}} media outlets. Before recording the follow-up to its debut, the band released the acoustic EP/DVD My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue. The EP was the band's first charting on the Billboard 200 at number 153. From Under the Cork Tree {{was recorded in}} Burbank, California, and served as {{the first time the}} band had stayed in California {{for an extended period of}} time. The group lived in corporate housing during the making of the album. In contrast to Take This to Your Graves rushed recording schedule, Fall Out Boy took a much more gradual pace while working on From Under the Cork Tree. It was the first Fall Out Boy record in which Stump created all the music and Wentz wrote all the lyrics, continuing the approach they took for some songs on Grave. Stump felt that this process was much more [...] "smooth" [...] as every member was able to focus on his individual strengths. He explained: [...] "We haven't had any of those moments when I play the music and he'll say, 'I don't like that,' and he'll read me lyrics and I'll say, 'I don't like those lyrics.' It's <b>very</b> <b>natural</b> and fun." [...] Despite this, the band had great difficulty creating its desired sound for the album, constantly scrapping new material. Two weeks before recording sessions began, the group abandoned ten songs and wrote eight more, including the album's first single, [...] "Sugar, We're Goin Down." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Back to December"'s {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Yoann Lemoine, who directed the video for Katy Perry's [...] "Teenage Dream", and was filmed in late December 2010 before Christmas Day. In an interview with Country Music Television, Lemoine explained that he developed {{the idea for the}} video after being inspired from the film, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. He also told MTV News that he wanted the video to be simple yet metaphorical. He added, [...] "I wanted to work on the coldness of feelings in a very visual way, playing with the snow, the distance and sadness." [...] He wanted to focus on Swift's look in the video so that she would come off as accessible, saying [...] "I wanted her to perform a <b>very</b> <b>natural</b> way, to make her look very European. This was the main challenge to me. All of Taylor's world is very far away from my culture, but I saw something in her that could be very rough and heartbreaking; far from the princess glittery outfits and glam that she often goes for." [...] Lemoine was allowed {{to take control of the}} whole production of the video, although it was Swift's idea to have her character leave the letter for her beloved. Swift's love interest in the video was played by male model, Guntars Asmanis. Lemoine commented that Asmanis was the perfect fit for Swift's love interest, saying [...] "I wanted a boy that was fragile and beautiful. I didn't want to go for a hunk or a perfect cheesy boy that would have killed the sincerity of the video." [...] The music video premiered on January 13, 2011, on CMT and Great American Country. Footages of the school and baseball stadium in the video were filmed in Binghamton, New York, in MacArthur Park while scenes with Swift were shot in an old country mansion outside of Nashville.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, debutant {{director}} Bala {{offered him}} {{the role of}} the rogue, Sethu (Chiyaan), in the film Sethu. To prepare for the character, Vikram shaved his head, lost twenty-one kilograms and grew his nails long for the role. [...] After beginning production in April 1997, the film went through development hell after industry strikes and lack of funds hampered progress. During this phase, he did not accept other acting offers {{in order to maintain the}} continuity of his looks. The film then struggled to find a distributor, who shunned it due to the tragic climax and the film remained unreleased. Vikram described the period of production as [...] "the worst phase of his career" [...] as he was financially strapped and [...] "his fire was in danger of dying down". He turned down an opportunity from a friend to take up a job in technology and attempted to stay in the industry by directing a serial titled Mounam Pesiyadhey, with Ameer as his assistant director. Sethu finally released in December 1999 and initially began running at a single noon show at a suburban theater but gradually gained an audience through word-of-mouth publicity. Eventually it ran for over one hundred days at several cinema halls across Chennai. Vikram was constantly being mobbed by people on the streets as a result of the film's success. Critics praised Vikram's performance with a reviewer referring to Vikram as [...] "a revelation" [...] and that [...] "he is <b>very</b> <b>natural</b> and his acting in last few scenes are just too good and could even be compared with the best we have seen". Similarly, a critic from the Malaysian daily, New Straits Times, described the film as an [...] "unforgettable experience" [...] and described Vikram's performance as [...] "praise-worthy". The performance drew accolades with Vikram winning the Filmfare Special Award– South and the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for his portrayal of the title character, while reports emerged that he missed out on the National Film Award for Best Actor by a single vote to Mohanlal. Post-Sethu, Vikram has described the film would have been close to him regardless of its commercial success and that it put him on the [...] "right path", with Vikram choosing to adapt the prefix of Chiyaan to his screen name.|$|E
