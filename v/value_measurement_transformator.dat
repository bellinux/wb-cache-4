This paper analyses fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> requirements in a controversial scenario, namely when a control premium exists. The analyses of the paper show that, while measurement rules around control premiums could have a material impact on fair <b>value</b> <b>measurements</b> and the financial statements as a whole, significant fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> issues remain unresolved. The conclusion is that fair <b>value</b> <b>measurements</b> should include or exclude control premiums consistently. It is argued that including control premiums for all fair <b>value</b> <b>measurements</b> is the most faithful representation of the underlying economic phenomenon. This paper contributes to the fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> debate by comparing the merits of alternative fair <b>value</b> <b>measurements</b> for control premiums and highlights an area where researchers, investors and other users should exercise caution when evaluating financial statements...|$|R

40|$|There are two {{important}} points in which {{in which we}} need assets and liabilities measured in financial accounting: on initial recognition and at a balance sheet day. Many International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) used the fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> concept. But most of these standards use the fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> method only at a balance sheet day. On initial recognition assets and liabilities are measured usually at costs. The IASB presented the discussion paper 2 ̆ 01 cMeasurement Bases for Financial Accounting 2 ̆ 013 Measurement on Initial Recognition (2005) 2 ̆ 01 d which proposed fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> on initial recognition for all assets and liabilities.

40|$|Many {{have argued}} that {{measuring}} financial instruments at fair value might not reflect firms’ financial condition. Prior study finds that managers manipulate the “disclosure” of fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> (Song et al. 2010). In this study, we attempt to provide evidence regarding manager’s incentive to manipulate the disclosure of fair <b>value</b> <b>measurements</b> by examining whether the disclosure of less relevant fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> {{is related to the}} odds of earnings management. We find that firms with more Level 3 assets and liabilities (i. e., less value relevant fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement)</b> are more likely to recognize positive unrealized gains to meet or beat analyst forecast target. In addition, we find that only firms with weak corporate governance disclose more Level 3 fair value liabilities and recognize unrealized gains into reported earnings to meet or beat analyst forecast target. This evidence suggests that managers manipulate the disclosure of fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> in order to manage reported earnings via the adoption of fair value option. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the impact on}} management discretion {{about the use of}} present value for the purpose of fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> on liabilities. On discussing above the subject, I focused on SFAS No. 143 : Asset Retirement Obligations, which is first statement about fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> on liability when SFAC No. 7 : Using Cash Flow Information and Present <b>Value</b> in Accounting <b>Measurements</b> was published. As to fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> on liabilities, the use of present value will be expected to facilitate decision usefulness because of improving reality on stock and avoid recognizing unrealized profit. In consideration of the characteristics of event that creates asset retirement obligations, there are conceptually two types of obligations, which are incurred upon acquisition, or any time during the operating life of an asset, either ratably of nonratably. As practical problem, however it is difficult to identify them separately. Therefore, it is necessary to management judgments. It has been seemed that fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> eliminate management discretion.

40|$|PURPOSE : To {{investigate}} {{the extent to}} which different prices within the bid-ask spread are used for fair <b>value</b> <b>measurements</b> and evaluate the potential consequences thereof. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH : The paper investigates different level one fair <b>value</b> <b>measurements</b> of exchange-traded funds’ equity investments. Using descriptive methods, it compares actual and stated fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> policies. In addition, comparative value-relevance of these measurements is investigated in regression analysis. FINDINGS : Most fair <b>value</b> <b>measurements</b> are based on closing prices, but stated accounting policies and actual measurements frequently differ. Results also show that the bid-close spread of underlying investments is value-relevant in determining the bidclose spreads of ETFs themselves. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS : Findings are specific to unleveraged ETFs, the sample country and sample period used and only apply to investments in listed equities. Conclusions from this study may assist in predicting market perceptions of the risk of listed equity portfolios. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS : This paper sheds light on the practical impact of the recent change in fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> guidance. ORIGINALITY/VALUE : This study provides evidence {{on the size of the}} bid-ask spread of actual investment portfolios and its potential impact. It shows that bid-close spreads of underlying investments are used to price the bid-close spreads of ETFs themselves and that stated and actual accounting policies often differ. Findings imply that standardsetters might be influenced by actual accounting practices. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe use of fair <b>value</b> <b>measurements</b> for {{financial}} reporting purposes steadily increased {{during the last}} decades, the IASB being seen {{as one of its}} main promoters. Fair value also stirred significant debates in the context of EU‟s negotiation regarding IFRS adoption, finally generating the IAS 39 carve-out seen by many as the cost paid by the IASB. As if the standard setting process for fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> was not challenging enough, the recent financial crisis raised even more questions born from difficulties proven in particular cases. Furthermore, we can not neglect the forces at stake when discussing the politics in accounting, fair value again offering an extremely rich research venue. The banking industry‟s particular involvement in relation to fair value standards and regulations stands as a first indication in this direction. The main objective of our paper is to offer a synthesis on the current state of affairs in relation to fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> in financial reporting. Our paper follows the standard setting process for fair <b>value</b> <b>measurements</b> starting with the international arena and further focusing on the particularities of an emerging economy. The analysis is completed by including the Romanian valuers‟ perspective on fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement.</b> The employed research methodology includes content analysis based on IASB‟s due process documents, accounting standards and regulations, as well as implementing a questionnaire survey involving Romanian professional valuers. Our paper contributes to the literature on the use of fair value in financial reporting, mainly arguing for the necessity of its consideration in relation to different information needs coming from different users. We finally conclude that if we are to continue the plan to expand the use of fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement,</b> significant clarifications remain necessary in approaching accounting standards, regulations and practices...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> by 228 listed {{companies}} in the UK and Australia {{around the time of}} adoption of IFRS from 1 January 2005. We test whether within and between country comparability in policy choices (as measured by T indices) has changed in relation to (a) mandatory and (b) optional use of fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement.</b> Mandatory requirements related to financial instruments (IAS 39) and share-based payments (IFRS 2) have increased comparability, with a weaker effect for biological assets (IAS 41). In relation to the optional use of fair value, comparability increased in relation to property (IAS 16) because some companies discontinued fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement.</b> Under IAS 39, the fair value option for other financial assets and other financial liabilities decreased comparability. Options to use fair value in other areas (intangible assets, plant and equipment and investment properties) are not generally taken up, either for on-going measurement or on IFRS adoption (under the 'deemed cost' option). The results suggest a conservative approach and/or lack of incentives to use fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> for most companies.
