2500|$|The {{end of the}} 19th {{century was}} a {{difficult}} time for the Chablis growers. Firstly, with new railway systems linking {{all parts of the}} country with Paris, there was inexpensive wine from regions in the Midi that undercut Chablis. The vineyards were affected by oidium from 1886, and then phylloxera from 1887. Effective replacement of <b>vinestocks</b> to counter phylloxera took some 15 years. Many Chablis producers gave up winemaking, the acreage in the region steadily declining throughout much of the early 20th century. By the 1950s there were only [...] of vines planted in Chablis.|$|R
50|$|Blanc du Bois (French, {{literally}} white grape of the wood) is an American hybrid grape {{that was}} created in 1968 by John A. Mortensen at the University of Floridaâ€™s Central Florida Research and Education Center in Leesburg, Florida. Mr. Mortensen created this variety by crossing various Vitis vinifera grape varieties such as Golden Muscat with native Florida varieties. When released in 1987, Blanc du Bois became another grape variety in the small but growing number of vine types that can both produce marketable wine on their own yet can withstand Pierce's Disease, a bacterial infection that destroys nearly all vinifera <b>vinestocks</b> imported into the southern United States.:.|$|R

Trials were conducted on Round seedless variety in Manisa. In the grafted vineyard, the yield increases paralelly to the crop load. A yield difference of 116 % between minimum and maximum crop loads occurred in table grapes. However, total soluble solids (TSS) {{and the number of}} defective clusters reduced at the ratio of 6. 3 and 30. 1 %. Output of raisins (31. 1 %) increased. Also, number of dormant buds increased paralelly to crop loads (46. 2 %). In the ungrafted vineyard, a yield difference of 96 % between minimum and maximum crop loads occurred in table grapes. However, TSS reduced at the ratio of 8. 7 % the number of defective cluster increased at the ratio of 81. 8 %.
