When production was halted, many materials were left in an intermediate state. Some of this product material included enriched uranium compounds that had to be repackaged for shipment of off-site storage. This paper provides an overview, technical description, and status of a new application of existing technology, a <b>vacuum</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>system,</b> to repackage the uranium bearing compounds for shipment. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>system</b> provides a method of transferring compounds from their current storage configuration into packages that meet the Department of Transportation (DOT) shipping requirements for fissile materials. This is a necessary activity, supporting removal of nuclear materials prior to site decontamination and decommissioning, key to the Fernald site's closure process...|$|E

To improve piping insulation effect and reduce the heat losses, Hubei Salnner Vacuum Science & Technology Co., Ltd has designed and developed a suitable <b>vacuum</b> <b>transfer</b> tube for the HTF of {{solar thermal power}} generation system, which can reduce heat losses effectively.

40|$|Hardware-in-the-loop (HWiL) {{is a form}} of {{component}} testing where hardware components are linked with software models. In order to test mechanical components an additional <b>transfer</b> <b>system</b> is required to link the software and hardware subsystems. The <b>transfer</b> <b>system</b> typically comprises sensors and actuators and the dynamic effects of these components need to be eliminated to give accurate results. In this paper an emulator-based control strategy is presented for actuator-based HWiL. Emulator-based control can solve the twin problems of stability and fidelity caused by the unwanted <b>transfer</b> <b>system</b> (actuator) dynamics. Significantly EBC can emulate the inverse of a <b>transfer</b> <b>system</b> which is not causally invertible, allowing a wider range of more complex <b>transfer</b> <b>systems</b> to be controlled.

40|$|In this study, we {{proposed}} a newly designed sulfuric acid <b>transfer</b> <b>system</b> for the sulfur-iodine (SI) thermochemical cycle. The proposed sulfuric acid <b>transfer</b> <b>system</b> was evaluated using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis for investigating thermodynamic/hydrodynamic characteristics and material properties. This analysis was conducted to obtain reliable continuous operation parameters; in particular, a thermal analysis {{was performed on the}} bellows box and bellows at amplitudes and various frequencies (0. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0 Hz). However, the high temperatures and strongly corrosive operating conditions of the current sulfuric acid system present challenges with respect to the structural materials of the <b>transfer</b> <b>system.</b> To resolve this issue, we designed a novel <b>transfer</b> <b>system</b> using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon®) as a bellows material for the transfer of sulfuric acid. We also carried out a CFD analysis of the design. The CFD results indicated that the maximum applicable temperature of PTFE is about 533 K (260 °C), even though its melting point is around 600 K. This result implies that the PTFE is a potential material for the sulfuric acid <b>transfer</b> <b>system.</b> The CFD simulations also confirmed that the sulfuric acid <b>transfer</b> <b>system</b> was designed properly for this particular investigation...|$|R

40|$|A recent theory {{posits that}} the quantum <b>vacuum</b> can <b>transfer</b> {{momentum}} to magnetoelectric media (the Feigel effect). Several related theories of <b>vacuum</b> momentum <b>transfer</b> to media {{have since been}} proposed. Neither these, nor the original theory have been observed experimentally, the existence a Feigel effect remaining highly contentious. Some investigations predict a measurable effect; others conclude <b>vacuum</b> momentum <b>transfer</b> to magnetoelectric media is not physically possible. Most analyses, including the original Fiegel theory, do not model experimentally realistic geometries and boundary conditions. I recently provided an alternative derivation of Feigel theory applied to realistic geometries, proposing experimental tests. I show here that in such geometries {{the existence of a}} steady Feigel effect (time-independent magnetoelectric susceptibilities) is equivalent to a violation of the first law of thermodynamics. A steady Feigel effect should not exist, as confirmed by a semi-classical quantum electrodynamic analysis. However, unsteady Feigel effects compatible with QED and thermodynamics are possible, and two such new effects are proposed. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
