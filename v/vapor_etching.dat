For GaAs samples masked with silicon nitride stripes that are wider than 30 tzm, the etch depth increased compared to unmasked samples, {{the magnitude of}} which increased with increasing mask width. Etching of bulk substrates of (ll l) Ga and (lll) As GaAs revealed a dependence of etch rate on crystal orientation, with (ll l) Ga> (100) GaAs> (lll) As. Increasing etch temperature duced the orientation dependence of etch rates. Orientation dependence of etch rates was also observed on non-planar GaAs substrates patterned to expose different orientations on wet-etched groove structures. In this case, etch rate differences between the different orientations were amplified {{when compared to the}} bulk substrate results. Finally, {{it was found that the}} extent of mask undercutting depended on the direction of mask stripes in a fashion consistent with the orientation reactivity results.

Etch rate predictions compare favorably with experiments performed in the vertical reactor at several temperatures ranging from 525 to 590 °C and CH 3 I mole fractions from 0. 005 to 0. 050 in an H 2 carrier gas. Agreement between the data and the model verifies our earlier assertion that gas phase decomposition f CH 3 I is the rate-limiting step, and that the etchant species are I {{and to a lesser}} extent CH 3 radicals. Predictions further show that radial etch rate uniformity improves from a 5 % variation over 50 % of the substrate at low rotation (20 - 100 rpm) to a 5 % variation over 80 % of the substrate at 500 rpm. Increasing rotation rate also reduces the etch rate, a result that is in contrast to earlier esults for OMVPE growth from TMGa and AsHy These contrasting results arise because growth is rate limited by gas phase diffusion of TMGa, whereas CH 3 I <b>vapor</b> <b>etching</b> is rate limited by gas phase decomposition f CH 3 I. 1...|$|E

We proposed in this work three process flows based on the use of buried mask which could allow the fabrication of self-aligned planar double gate transistors. The novel concept of buried mask consists into modifying the etch rate of a buried polysilicon or oxide layer. This etch rate modification being defined by ion implantation, etch stop or scacrificial zones aligned with the implantation mask can thus be fabricated. This technique solve the alignment of the front and back gate. Ion implantation causes damages to the implanted target, and is used to dope semiconductor material. If the implanted atoms have a small radii they can induce stress to the implanted lattice. These three consequences of ion implantation, damage, doping and stress are used to modify the etch rate of oxide and polysilicon. High etching selectivity are reached, which allow the fabrication of a localized buried sacrificial or etch stop zone, called buried mask. The definition of the buried mask being done by ion implantation, it opens the possibility to fabricate a buried mask aligned with the implantation mask.

The growth of emerging new materials heterostructures such as InN or In-rich Ga(x) In(1 -x) N require deposition methods operating at higher vapor densities due to the high thermal decomposition pressure in these materials. High nitrogen pressure has been demonstrated to suppress thermal decomposition of InN, but has not been applied yet in chemical <b>vapor</b> deposition or <b>etching</b> experiments. Because of the difficulty with maintaining stochiometry at elevated temperature, current knowledge regarding thermodynamic data for InN, e. g., its melting point, temperature-dependent heat capacity, heat and entropy of formation are known with far less accuracy than for InP, InAs and InSb. Also, no information exists regarding the partial pressures of nitrogen and phosphorus along the liquidus surfaces of mixed-anion alloys of InN, of which the InN(x) P(1 -x) system is the most interesting option. A miscibility gap is expected for InN(x) P(1 -x) pseudobinary solidus compositions, but its extent is not established at this point by experimental studies under near equilibrium conditions.

High NCG thickness uniformities of 87 % over full wafer were achieved. Surface roughness was measured by atomic force microscopy and shows root mean square (RMS) values of less than 0. 23 nm for 3 nm thin films. NCG films deposited on quartz and sapphire show promising performance as transparent conductor with 13 kΩ/X sheet resistance at 85 % transparency. Furthermore, the suitability of the developed PECVD NCG films for microfabrication was demonstrated. Microfabrication process development was focused on four device types. NCG membranes were fabricated based on through-wafer inductively coupled plasma etching from the back, and consecutive membrane release by HF <b>vapor</b> <b>etching.</b> The fabrication of suspended NCG strips, based on HF vapor release, shows promising results, but was not entirely successful due to insufficient thickness of the sacrificial oxide. Top gated NCG strips are successfully fabricated, and the increased modulation by the top gate is demonstrated. Finally, NCG nanowire fabrication is performed on 150 mm wafers. Experiments yielded an increased back gate modulation effect by a reduced NCG thickness, although no nanowire formation was observed. A highly accurate focused ion beam (FIB) prototyping technique was developed and applied to exfoliated graphene in this work. This technique systematically avoids any exposure of the graphene to Ga+-ions {{through the use of}} an alignment marker system, achieving alignment accuracies better than 250 nm. Contacts were deposited by FIB- or e-beam-assisted tungsten deposition, and FIB trench milling was used to confine conduction to a narrow channel. A channel passivation method based on e-beam-assisted insulator deposition has been demonstrated, and showed a reduction of ion damage to the graphene. Three fabricated transistor structures were electrically characterized. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The substrate was etched with water <b>vapor</b> subsequent to <b>etching</b> with commercial hydrogen chloride. Magnification approximately 36, 000 X. Epitaxial growth experiments were also carried out in which the in situ etching of silicon substrates by a hydrogen-hydrogen chloride mixture was followed by using a hydrogen-water vapor mixture. The use of water etching was found to eliminate many of the pre-cipitates in the interface region (Fig. 3) due presum-ably to the hydrolysis of silicon nitride.

This result also verifies the previous assumption that the small concen-tration of oxygen in the etchant would not cause the formation of silicon dioxide on the substrate surface. Conclusions Epitaxial silicon films prepared by using commercial hydrogen chloride as an in situ etchant {{have been found to be}} generally of good crystal perfection by chemical etching and optical microscope techniques. However, transmission electron microscopy has re-vealed the presence of high concentration of precipi-tates, presumably silicon nitride, in the substrate-film interface region. Most of these precipitates can be re-moved by using water vapor as an etchant. These re-sults i l lustrate the significance of using high purity reagents for the in situ etching of substrates in the epi-taxial growth process.

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{energy needs}} of humanity, coupled with geopolitics of fossil fuels, are imposing demand {{on the energy}} supply. A perennial supply of energy is possible by tapping into renewable sources as well as making the current process more efficient. This can be achieved via the use of thermoelectrics, i. e. {{they can be used}} to generate energy by converting sunlight into electricity via solar thermoelectrics and increase the efficiency of current processes by converting the wasted heat into electricity. However, the current state-of-the-art thermoelectrics are inefficient and expensive due to the use of rare earth materials. Nanomaterials, especially nanowires, are on the forefront of advancement in thermoelectrics. Recent theoretical and experimental reports indicate the superior energy conversion performances of nanowires compared to their bulk counter parts. However, this superior performance is only observed in single-nanowire devices. Despite more than two decades of research, macro-devices based on large-scale nanowire assemblies, have not been realized. The three main roadblocks for fabricating such large-scale assemblies are lack of 1) methods for mass producing nanowires of any desired chemical composition, 2) techniques for assembling these nanowires into energy conversion devices in an interface engineered manner, and 3) techniques to stabilize the nanowires at higher temperatures against air- water- and acid-assisted degradation. In this context, the objective of this work is to design a strategy to obtain stable and efficient nanowire-based thermoelectric devices. The material systems chosen for this effort are Zinc Phosphide Zn 3 P 2, Magnesium Silicide, Mg 2 Si, and Manganese Silicide MnSi 1. 75. Methods for mass production of Zn 3 P 2 and Mg 2 Si nanowires have been realized previously via a combination of chemical <b>vapor</b> deposition, electroless <b>etching</b> and solid-state diffusion. The assembly and aligning of nanowires was achieved using shear forces via Equal Channel Angular Extrusion (a severe plastic deformation technique). Assembly of the nanowires was also achieved via welding of nanowires utilizing the solid-state diffusion. The nanowires were chemically stabilized by nonconformally decorating them with boron nitride. The stabilization and welding of nanowires helped to achieve decreased thermal conductivity thereby improving their thermoelectric performance compared to the as-obtained nanowire pellets...|$|R
