5|$|In {{the case}} of mothers of young children, Russian law allows for {{deferment}} of a prison sentence until the child reaches the age of 14. Such a request was controversially granted in 2011 to Anna Shavenkova, who had been sentenced to two years and six months prison for <b>vehicular</b> <b>manslaughter.</b> It was alleged that her request was granted because of her family connections.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} of the prison genre was The Big House (1930). In The Big House, Robert Montgomery plays a squirmy inmate who is sentenced to six years after committing <b>vehicular</b> <b>manslaughter</b> while under the influence. His cell mates are a murderer played by Wallace Beery and a forger played by Chester Morris. The picture features future staples of the prison genre such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, visitations, an escape, and the codes of prison life. The protagonist, Montgomery, ends up being a loathsome character, a coward who will sell anyone in the prison out to get an early release. The film was banned in Ohio, {{the site of the}} deadly prison riots that inspired it. Numbered Men, The Criminal Code, Shadow of the Law, Convict's Code, and others, from no less than seven studios, followed. However, prison films mainly appealed to men, and had weak box office performances as a result.|$|E

50|$|In some jurisdictions, {{such as the}} United States, {{there exists}} the {{specific}} crime of <b>Vehicular</b> or intoxication <b>manslaughter.</b> An equivalent in Canada is causing death by criminal negligence under the Criminal Code, punishable by a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.|$|R
25|$|In the United States, traffic {{laws are}} {{regulated}} by the states and municipalities through their respective traffic codes. Most of these are based {{at least in part}} on the Uniform Vehicle Code, but there are variations from state to state. In states such as Florida, traffic law and criminal law are separate, therefore, unless someone flees a scene of an accident, commits <b>vehicular</b> homicide or <b>manslaughter,</b> they are only guilty of a minor traffic offense. However, states such as South Carolina have completely criminalized their traffic law, so, for example, one is guilty of a misdemeanor simply for travelling 5 miles over the speed limit.|$|R
50|$|Severely {{embarrassing}} (and causing infighting {{among the}} Yupettes) the Yupettes and Vadar, the situation causes Vadar {{to go on}} a homicidal rampage. Driving her car through the school grounds, she has no regard for the safety of anyone on the school grounds. During the aftermath, she tries to kill The Eradicators, as well as Eaglebauer, and even substitute teacher Rita. Not so easily defeated, however, the Eradicators continue to fight back even against the <b>vehicular</b> attempt at <b>manslaughter,</b> and slick a section of the school with chemical extinguishers, which cause Vadar to crash into the school, causing it to explode, and the school catches fire {{for the second time in}} 12 years.|$|R

25|$|A sequel, , {{taking place}} {{six years after}} the first film's events, was {{released}} on October 26, 2012. Christophe Gans could not direct the sequel because he was busy directing an Onimusha film adaptation. Roger Avary was originally attached to write the screenplay and had written the first draft before he was arrested for <b>vehicular</b> <b>manslaughter</b> on November 2010. Michael J. Bassett was later hired to write and direct the sequel. The sequel was panned by critics, holding a 7% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 {{survey of}} the largest cities in the United States by walkscore.com {{determined}} the city of Miami to be ranked eighth in terms of walkability, with an overall walkscore of 73, though Miami provides a case study for the well-known fallibility of WalkScore for not accounting for safety and other factors. The ranking is based on proximity of restaurants, food, transit stops, and entertainment, among other things. Despite this, Miami, along with many younger, auto-dependent southern and western (Sunbelt) cities, is consistently ranked {{as one of the}} most dangerous cities in the US for pedestrians due to rude drivers, very wide roads, and the number of hit and runs; Miami-Dade County was found to have the highest number of pedestrian strikes in a 2013 study. Often several cars will hit a pedestrian and drive away. Sometimes people are even killed while waiting in bus stops when cars run off the road and destroy them. In 2002, pedestrians in Tampa-Orlando and Miami-Fort Lauderdale were found to be three times more likely to die than pedestrians in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus, Ohio. In 2011, all four of the most dangerous metropolitan areas or pedestrians in the United States were in Florida, with Miami-Fort Lauderdale coming in fourth, having a Pedestrian Danger Index five times greater than the New York City metropolitan area based on 2008–2012 data. Additionally, many motorists are acquitted or receive minor punishments for crimes such as DUI <b>vehicular</b> <b>manslaughter</b> and other reckless driving incidents.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Vandross first {{spotted the}} talent of Jimmy Salvemini, who was fifteen at the time, on Star Search. He thought Salvemini had the perfect voice {{for some of}} his songs, and {{contacted}} him. He was managed by his brother, Larry Salvemini. A contract was negotiated with Elektra Records for $250,000 and Vandross agreed to produce the album. He contacted his old friends Cheryl Lynn, Alfa Anderson (Chic), Phoebe Snow and Irene Cara {{to appear on the}} record. After the album was completed, Luther, Jimmy, and Larry decided to celebrate. On January 12, 1986, they were riding in Vandross's 1985 convertible Mercedes-Benz on Laurel Canyon Boulevard, in the north section of Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles. Luther was driving at 48mph in a 35mph zone when his Mercedes veered across the double yellow center line of the two lane street, turned sideways and collided with the front of a 1972 Mercury Marquis that was headed southbound, then swung around and hit a 1979 Cadillac Seville head on. Vandross and Jimmy were rushed to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Larry, who was in the passenger seat, was killed during the collision. Vandross suffered three broken ribs, a broken hip, several bruises and facial cuts. Jimmy, who was {{in the back of the}} car, had cuts, bruises and contusions. Vandross faced <b>vehicular</b> <b>manslaughter</b> charges as a result of Larry's death, and his driving license was suspended for a year. There was no evidence Vandross was under the influence of alcohol or other drugs; he pleaded no contest to reckless driving. At first, the Salvemini family was supportive of Vandross, but later filed a wrongful death suit against him. The case was settled out of court with a payment to the Salvemini family for about $630,000. Jimmy Salvemini's album, Roll It, was released later that year.|$|E

2500|$|On December 31, 2013, Uber driver Syed Muzaffar {{ran over}} and killed six-year old Sofia Liu in San Francisco, {{severely}} injuring {{her mother and}} brother in the same incident. The driver was logged in and waiting for a fare, but not carrying a passenger, {{at the time of}} the accident. Liu's family filed a wrongful death claim against Uber, claiming that this made Uber responsible for the driver's actions. Uber deactivated Muzaffar's account after the accident. Syed Muzaffar was arrested on the scene and was charged with misdemeanor <b>vehicular</b> <b>manslaughter</b> on December 8, 2014. Uber said in a written statement that all drivers had undergone a [...] "stringent" [...] background check, and Muzaffar's was [...] "clear". Muzaffar had been arrested in Florida in 2004 on a reckless driving charge, but California law prohibited private background check services like Uber's from reporting arrests and crimes more than seven years old. Syed Muzaffar's <b>vehicular</b> <b>manslaughter</b> trial was scheduled to start August 5, 2015. In July 2015, Uber reached a settlement with the family for an undisclosed sum.|$|E
2500|$|After {{addressing}} {{the matter of}} fundamental rights, the Court delineated the rationale behind its decision. It first turned to the long-standing legal tradition of looking to a person's intent {{as a way of}} distinguishing between two acts with identical physical consequences. For example, a person who accidentally kills a pedestrian while blinded by the sun might only face punishment for <b>vehicular</b> <b>manslaughter,</b> while a person who intentionally and purposefully kills another with his car could be punished for murder. While these two acts give the same results, they are distinguished by the intent of the actors.|$|E
2500|$|Attias {{was charged}} with four counts of murder, four counts of <b>vehicular</b> <b>manslaughter</b> with gross negligence, and five counts of felony driving under the influence. Residents of his hall told police and the campus paper that Attias had been known for his erratic behavior, {{including}} stalking another student. Several students referred to him as [...] "Crazy Dave" [...] and [...] "Tweaker." [...] The case received additional media attention because David Attias {{is the son of}} Dan Attias, a prominent Hollywood TV director. Attias pleaded {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, and his trial sparked significant interest.|$|E
2500|$|The {{band members}} {{have also had}} their share of scrapes with the law and life. In 1984, Neil was driving home from a liquor store in his De Tomaso Pantera {{when he was in}} a head-on collision; his passenger, Hanoi Rocks drummer Nicholas [...] "Razzle" [...] Dingley, was killed. Neil, charged with a DUI and <b>vehicular</b> <b>manslaughter,</b> was sentenced to 30 days in jail (though he only served 18 days) and {{received}} a $2,000,000 fine. The short jail term was pleaded for by his lawyers enabling Neil to be able to tour and pay the fine. The album Theatre of Pain (1985) was dedicated in Dingley's honor, and it started a new glam metal phase in the band's style. The band would also later release two box sets titled [...] "Music to Crash Your Car To".|$|E
2500|$|Norwood {{was neither}} arrested nor charged with <b>vehicular</b> <b>manslaughter</b> due to {{insufficient}} evidence. Law enforcement officials reported that Norwood was driving her car at 65 {{miles per hour}} and did not notice that vehicles ahead of her had slowed considerably. Her vehicle then collided with the rear of Aboudihaj's, causing the Toyota to strike another vehicle before sliding sideways and impacting the center divider. As the Toyota came to a stop, it was hit by yet another vehicle. A source in the California Highway Patrol later reported that Aboudihaj actually struck {{the car in front}} of her and then slammed on her brakes before Norwood made contact. The sudden stop caused Norwood to hit Aboudihaj's car. As confirmed, toxicology reports showed that Aboudihaj had [...] "slight traces" [...] of marijuana in her system at the time of the crash.|$|E
2500|$|The Lady Lies {{was also}} a box office success. [...] In 1930 she starred {{opposite}} Maurice Chevalier in The Big Pond, which was filmed in both English and French. She co-starred with Fredric March in Manslaughter (1930), receiving critical acclaim for her performance as a woman charged with <b>vehicular</b> <b>manslaughter.</b> She was paired with March in four productions, including Honor Among Lovers (1931) with Ginger Rogers. While these films were box office successes, she also starred in Mysterious Mr. Parkes (1931), which was a French-language version of Slightly Scarlet for the European market, although it was also screened in the United States. She sang and played piano in the Ernst Lubitsch musical The Smiling Lieutenant (1931), which was the year's 10th domestic box-office success; Colbert was critically acclaimed for her ability to shrewdly play a character role opposite Miriam Hopkins. Colbert concluded the year with appearance in a modest successful film: [...] His Woman with Gary Cooper.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2006, Norwood was {{involved}} in a fatal automobile accident on Los Angeles' San Diego (405) Freeway. The accident claimed the life of the 38-year-old driver of a Toyota that was struck by Norwood's Range Rover. Norwood was neither arrested nor charged with <b>vehicular</b> <b>manslaughter</b> due to insufficient evidence. Nevertheless, multiple lawsuits were filed against Norwood, all of which were ultimately settled out of court by her civil attorney. Posing an extraordinary hardship for Brandy and her family, Norwood stepped down from her role as a judge on the second season of the amateur talent contest America's Got Talent and went into hiatus. Expanding on dealing with the aftermath of the tragedy, Norwood explained, [...] "I just wanted people to know that this wasn't news. It's not something that should be talked about like it's gossip. You don't like me? Fine. But don't use this situation to try to hurt me, because the guilt of being involved is enough. It's something that I'll never truly, truly get over." [...] While the accident put a halt on the album's production, Norwood soon resumed recording which she found to be therapeutic: [...] "I had to face it and find the strength to move forward. Connecting back with music has definitely helped me through everything. Once I got back in the studio, the butterflies went away." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the state}} of California, {{depending}} {{on the degree of}} recklessness and whether alcohol was involved, a person could be charged with progressively more serious offenses: <b>vehicular</b> <b>manslaughter,</b> <b>vehicular</b> <b>manslaughter</b> while intoxicated, gross <b>vehicular</b> <b>manslaughter</b> while intoxicated, or second-degree murder. In any of these cases, the prosecution must prove that the driver committed some wrongful act (which could be a felony, a misdemeanor, an infraction, or a lawful act that might cause death) and that the wrongful act caused the collision and the death of the victim. Murder charges are usually reserved for the most egregious cases, such as a convicted DUI offender who drives recklessly while intoxicated and thereby causes a fatal collision.|$|E
