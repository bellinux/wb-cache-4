We believe WWANs can be availed for voice communications employing Voice Over IP technologies. Such a communication {{will be of}} better quality and offer higher resilience compared to voice communication over a cellular phone (using cellular <b>voice</b> <b>networks).</b> We present a Quality of Service analysis of one-way voice communication over cellular <b>voice</b> <b>networks</b> and cellular WWANs. By studying different quality metrics we test if WWANs offer a better solution for voice communications compared to traditional cellular <b>voice</b> <b>networks.</b> We also study if employing more than one WWANs or cellular <b>voice</b> <b>networks</b> leads to a higher resilience in voice communication. by Omair S.

50|$|The Automatic <b>Voice</b> <b>Network</b> (AUTOVON, {{military}} designation 490-L) was a world-wide American military telephone system.

In June 1966 the Air Defense Command <b>voice</b> <b>network</b> was cut over to the new service. In 1969, AUTOVON switching centers opened in the United Kingdom, and later in other European countries, Asia, the Middle East, and Panama. It was {{a major part of}} the Defense Communications System (DCS), providing non-secure switched voice services. The system was replaced in the early 1990s by the Defense Switched Network.|$|E
