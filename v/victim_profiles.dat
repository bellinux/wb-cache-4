5000|$|Global Centurion {{worked on}} a U.S. Department of Justice funded contract, in {{collaboration}} with Texas Christian University, to help establish evidence of a link between organized crime and trafficking in persons. Global Centurion utilized case law from completed human trafficking prosecutions in the U.S. (1995 to 2015) to make the link between organized crime and human trafficking. Global Centurion used the FBI categories of organized criminal networks, including African Criminal Enterprises, Asian Criminal Enterprises, Balkan Criminal Enterprises, Eurasian Criminal Enterprises, Italian Organized Crime/Mafia, and Middle Eastern Criminal Enterprises to classify the types of organized criminal activity involved in trafficking in persons. In addition, Global Centurion used new classifications suggested by experts to identify traffickers as highly sophisticated international criminal enterprises such as cartels or syndicates; corporate/private businesses; crime families; brothel/business front such as massage parlors; criminal gangs; and [...] "crime couple plus one." [...] These categories aid in analyzing the data and creating crime, perpetrator, and <b>victim</b> <b>profiles.</b> The full report will be released in 2016.|$|E

However, due to the high content of personal information placed on {{social networking sites}}, {{as well as the}} ability to hide behind a pseudo-identity, such sites have become increasingly popular for sexual predators online. [...] Further, lack of age verification mechanisms is a cause of concern in these social networking platforms. However, it was also suggested that the majority of these simply transferred to using the services provided by Facebook. [...] While the numbers may remain small, it has been noted that the number of sexual predators caught using social networking sites has been increasing, and has now reached an almost weekly basis. In worst cases children have become victims of pedophiles or lured to meet strangers.They say that sexual predators can lurk anonymously through the wormholes of cyberspace and access <b>victim</b> <b>profiles</b> online. A number of highly publicized cases have demonstrated the threat posed for users, such as Peter Chapman who, under a false name, added over 3, 000 friends and went on to rape and murder a 17-year-old girl in 2009. A 12-year-old, Evergreen girl was safely found by the FBI with the help of Facebook; due to her mother learning of her daughter's conversation with a man she had met on the popular social networking application.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} {{attention given to}} identity theft, there is much confusion {{on how best to}} define and measure it. Recent attempts to measure its extent through victimization surveys or law enforcement files have varied considerably in the types of crimes included as identity theft. Some studies include credit card fraud, while others exclude it. This inconsistency in data collection has made it difficult to assess properly the extent of the crime. The current study uses data from the National Public Survey on White Collar Crime to determine the degree to which including credit card fraud as a type of identity theft affects <b>victim</b> <b>profiles</b> encompassing demographic characteristics, risky activities, and reporting decisions. Specifically, we compare <b>victim</b> <b>profiles</b> for victims of existing credit card fraud, new credit card fraud, and existing bank account fraud. Findings from our exploratory study suggest that including existing credit card fraud may obscure the fact that those who are female, black, young, and low income are disproportionately victimized by existing bank account fraud, which is the type of identity theft most financially damaging and most difficult to clear up for individuals. ...|$|E

40|$|Adult {{safeguarding}} is {{the subject}} of increasing attention in England and internationally. This article draws on research which developed a typology of ‘models of safeguarding’. ‘Models’ refer to different ways local authorities in England organise adult safeguarding (about which there is little evidence) rather than ‘model’ approaches to be emulated. The four models identified were: Dispersed-Generic (safeguarding work undertaken by operational teams); Dispersed-Specialist (safeguarding work undertaken partly by specialist social workers located in operational teams); Partially Centralised-Specialist (some safeguarding work undertaken by a central specialist safeguarding team); and Fully- Centralised-Specialist (all safeguarding work undertaken by a specialist safeguarding team). We explored associations between these models and other important variables (numbers of referrals, kinds of alleged abuse and characteristics of adults at risk) and outcomes. The article reports secondary analysis of English local authority safeguarding referral data and on the possible different costs of different models. Dispersed-Specialist sites appeared to have a higher rate of substantiating alleged abuse compared with other models. Statistical correlations were found with types of <b>victim</b> <b>profiles</b> and the perpetrator/victim relationship. It may be that decisions about local organisation of safeguarding are more affected by local organisational contexts than local authority model...|$|E
40|$|Online Social Networks (OSNs), such as Facebook, provide {{users with}} tools to share {{information}} along {{with a set of}} privacy controls preferences to regulate the spread of information. Current privacy controls are efficient to protect content data. However, the complexity of tuning them undermine their efficiency when protecting contextual information (such as the social network structure) that many users believe being kept private. In this paper, we demonstrate the extent of the problem of information leakage in Facebook. In particular, we show the possibility of inferring, from the network "surrounding" a victim user, some information that the victim set as hidden. We developed a system, named OSSINT (Open Source Social Network INTelligence), on top of our previous tool SocialSpy, that is able to infer hidden information of a victim profile and retrieve private information from public one. OSSINT retrieves the friendship network of a victim and shows how it is possible to infer additional private information (e. g., user personal preferences and hobbies). Our proposed system OSSINT goes extra mile about the network topology information, i. e., predicting new friendships using the victim's friends of friends network (2 -hop of distance from the victim profile), and hence possibly deduce private information of the full Facebook network. OSSINT correctly improved the previous results of SocialSpy predicting an average of 11 additional friendships with peaks of 20 new friends. Moreover, OSSINT, for the considered <b>victim</b> <b>profiles</b> demonstrated how it is possible to infer real life information such as current city, hometown, university, supposed being private...|$|E

Previous studies of RTCs in Trinidad and Tobago were primarily concerned with patterns of drivers use of seat belts, road collisions as a cause of mortality in young men, and the economic burden of road collisions. Attempts were made to model road fatalities, but limited epidemiological data meant that it was difficult to determine trends or develop models. Methods: This study determined the epidemiology of RTCs in Trinidad and Tobago over the period 2000 – 2011 using data collected by the Trinidad and Tobago Road Traffic Branch of the Police Service and secondary data from the Central Statistical Office. Data were analyzed using Excel, SPSS, and R statistical packages. Results: Fatalities were greater among men (80 %) than among women (20 %) and were highest on two major freeways in Trinidad [the Churchill–Roosevelt Highway and the Sir Solomon Hochoy Highway]. Most collisions occurred during the night among individuals between the ages of 15 and 44 years. Fatalities among drivers steadily increased over the study period and overtook fatalities among pedestrians, who were the group most affected in 2000. Most fatalities occurred at weekends.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the risk to}} major hazard plant from terrorists deliberately causing catastrophic industrial accidents. The United States of America Department of Justice [Assessment of the increased risk of terrorist or other criminal activity associated with posting off-site consequence analysis information on the internet, 2000] reports that “breaching a containment vessel of an industrial facility with an explosive or otherwise causing a chemical release may appear relatively simple to…a terrorist”. They concluded {{that the risk of}} such action is “real and credible”. Analysis of terrorism is often hampered by its being described as ‘irrational’; one corollary would be that it is unpredictable. However, terrorism may usefully be treated as a rational behaviour and in doing so it becomes possible to assess the risks it causes.

Results: Psychotic disorders were the most common findings (58 %). The most common type of crime was murder or murder attempt (52. 8 %), with a significant correlation between psychotic disorders and this type of crime (p < 0. 05). These crimes led to death in 89. 7 % of the cases, and in 34. 5 % the victim was a close relative. Mentally retarded patients committed proportionally more sexual crimes when compared to psychotic patients and considering only sexual crimes or murder attempts (p < 0. 05).
