At the point of sale, cash is socially less costly than debit cards for payments <b>below</b> <b>EUR</b> 1. 88 (SEK 20) and credit cards <b>below</b> <b>EUR</b> 42. 37 (SEK 450). The corresponding thresholds for the individual consumer are higher for debit cards and much lower for credit cards. Using unique survey data we show that consumers' payment behaviour is not consistent with what is socially optimal...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. According to the {{performed}} {{analysis of}} fatigue phenomena occurring in metals, {{the effects of}} fatigue appear {{in the form of}} lines and slip bands under loading conditions producing variable stresses with <b>values</b> <b>below</b> the fatigue limit of these metals. It is commonly accepted that variable stresses with constant amplitude of <b>values</b> <b>below</b> 0. 4 of the fatigue limit do not cause plastic strain in grains (lines and slip bands), thus they do not affect the fatigue life. This study is an attempt of quantitative assessment of the influence of stresses with <b>values</b> <b>below</b> the fatigue limit on fatigue life by using tests with programed two-step loading (variable-amplitude). Tests were performed with the use of C 45 steel specimens. 1...|$|R
