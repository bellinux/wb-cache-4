Air sampling and sulfuric acid measurement were carried out iso-kinetically using USEPA method 8. The acid mists were measured by the barium-thorin titration method.

40|$|The {{reduction}} in the trichloroethylene (TCE) vapor phase screening level by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in 2004 prompted a re-evaluation of groundwater contaminant source areas, transport mechanisms, and commingling of multiple CVOC plumes within a complex river basin at a confidential site in the Midwest. A USEPA Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) dictated that the former owner of the facility investigate and perform residential and commercial <b>vapor</b> phase <b>removal</b> action to achieve compliance with revised indoor air and subslab action levels. The AOC did not differentiate contaminant source areas, transport, or commingled contaminants. In response, a comprehensive re-evaluation of the river basin hydrogeology and groundwater chlorinated volatile organic compound (CVOC) distribution was completed to facilitate demarcation of the AOC <b>vapor</b> phase <b>removal</b> action boundary and to minimize cleanup of contaminants not attributable to the facility. CVOCs, including TCE, are hydrophobic compounds that are heavier than water which tend to persist as residual contamination in aquifer matrix and bleed off slowly over time into the groundwater. In 2007, an integrated investigation and review of remediation reports filed with state regulators, USGS hydrogeologic reports, and historical groundwater elevation data was conducted. The data were evaluated to identify additional CVOC source areas, map known CVOC plumes, establish groundwater flow transport pathways, and determine the potential for commingled CVOC plumes. Understanding the complex groundwater flow regime, strongly influenced by river stages, flood control structures, municipal well field production, and engineered recharge basins, was critical to resolving the migration pathway of multiple CVOC plumes. All data collected was compiled {{into a series of}} CVOC overlay maps to provide a working river basin model of CVOC distribution and migration based on groundwater flow. The distribution of CVOC source areas results in numerous instances of CVOCs plumes becoming commingled due to the groundwater flow patterns. As a result, the former owner recommended the reduction of the AOC <b>vapor</b> phase <b>removal</b> action boundary area by over 60 %, thus limiting the action area to immediately downgradient of the facility based on groundwater flow while identifying additional potential responsible parties (PRPs) for future cost recovery actions...|$|R
50|$|Membrane {{separation}} processes have a {{very important}} role in the separation industry. Nevertheless, they were not considered technically important until the mid-1970s. Membrane separation processes differ based on separation mechanisms and size of the separated particles. The widely used membrane processes include microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, electrolysis, dialysis, electrodialysis, gas separation, vapor permeation, pervaporation, membrane distillation, and membrane contactors. All processes except for pervaporation involve no phase change. All processes except (electro)dialysis are pressure driven. Microfltration and ultrafiltration is widely used in food and beverage processing (beer microfiltration, apple juice ultrafiltration), biotechnological applications and pharmaceutical industry (antibiotic production, protein purification), water purification and wastewater treatment, the microelectronics industry, and others. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes are mainly used for water purification purposes. Dense membranes are utilized for gas separations (removal of CO2 from natural gas, separating N2 from air, organic <b>vapor</b> <b>removal</b> from air or a nitrogen stream) and sometimes in membrane distillation. The later process helps in the separation of azeotropic compositions reducing the costs of distillation processes.|$|E

40|$|When a {{thin film}} of polymer is coated on to a quartz crystal {{microbalance}} (QCM), the QCM {{can be used to}} detect the rate of increase in weight of the polymer film as the volatile penetrant diffuses into the polymer. From this rate information the diffusion coefficient of the penetrant into the polymer can be computed. Calculations requiring this diffusion coefficient lead to values which approximate the monomeric friction coefficient of the polymer. This project has been concerned with the trial of crystal oscillating circuits suitable for driving polymer coated crystals in an atmosphere of penetrant. For these studies done at room temperature, natural rubber was used as an easily applied polymer that is readily penetrated by toluene vapors, qualities anticipated with polyimides when they are tested at T(g) in the presence of toluene. Three quartz crystal oscillator circuits were tested. The simplest circuit used +/- 5 volt dc and had a transistor to transistor logic (TTL) inverter chip that provides a 180 deg phase shift via a feed back loop. This oscillator circuit was stable but would not drive the crystal when the crystal was coated with polymer and subjected to toluene <b>vapors.</b> <b>Removal</b> of a variable resistor from this circuit increased stability but did not otherwise increase performance. Another driver circuit tested contained a two stage differential input, differential output, wide band video amplifier and also contain a feed back loop.

50|$|A {{saturation}} {{state is the}} point where a phase change begins or ends. For example, the saturated liquid line represents the point where any further addition of energy will cause {{a small portion of}} the liquid to convert to vapor. Likewise, along the saturated <b>vapor</b> line, any <b>removal</b> of energy will cause some of the vapor to condense back into a liquid, producing a mixture.

The temperature will remain constant while it is at constant pressure underneath the saturation dome (boiling water stays at a constant of 212F) until it reaches the saturated vapor line. This line is where the mixture has converted completely to vapor. Further heating of the saturated vapor will result in a superheated vapor state. This is because the vapor will be at a temperature higher than the saturation temperature (212F for water) for a given pressure.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — One {{source of}} {{disturbance}} in a pulsed T-ray signal {{is attributed to}} ambient water vapor. Water molecules in the gas phase selectively absorb T-rays at discrete frequencies corresponding to their molecular rotational transitions. This results in prominent resonances spread over the T-ray spectrum, and in the time domain the T-ray signal is observed as fluctuations after the main pulse. These effects are generally undesired, since they may mask critical spectroscopic data. So, ambient water vapor is commonly removed from the T-ray path by using a closed chamber during the measurement. Yet, in some applications a closed chamber is not applicable. This situation, therefore, motivates the need for another method to reduce these unwanted artifacts. This paper presents a study on a computational means to address the problem. Initially, a complex frequency response of water vapor is modeled from a spectroscopic catalog. Using a deconvolution technique, together with fine tuning {{of the strength of}} each resonance, parts of the water-vapor response are removed from a measured T-ray signal, with minimal signal distortion.

40|$|Rationale and Objectives. Hyperpolarized gases such as Xe- 129 and He- 3 {{have high}} {{potential}} as imaging agents for functional lung {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI). We present new technology offering Xe- 129 production rates with order-of-magnitude improvement over existing systems, to liter per hour at 50 % polarization., Human lung imaging studies with xenon, initially limited by the modest {{quantity and quality of}} hyperpolarized gas available, can now be performed with multiliter quantities several times daily. Materials and Methods. The polarizer is a continuolis-flow system capable of producing large quantities of highly-polarized 129 Xe through rubidium spin-exchange optical pumping. The low-pressure, high-velocity operating regime takes advantage of the enhancement in the spin exchange rate provided by van der Waals molecules dominating the atomic interactions. The long polarizing column moves the flow of the gas opposite to the laser direction, allowing efficient extraction of the laser light. Separate sections of the system assure full rubidium <b>vapor</b> saturation and <b>removal.</b> Results. The system is capable of producing 64 % polarization at 0. 3 L/hour Xe production rate. Increasing xenon flow reduces output polarization. Xenon polarization was studied as a function of different system operating parameters.
