40|$|<b>Very</b> elderly <b>patients</b> (i. e. ≥ 80 years) are disproportionally {{affected}} by acute ischemic stroke. They {{account for a}} third of hospital stroke admissions, but two thirds of overall stroke-related morbidity and mortality. There is some evidence of clinical benefit in treating selected <b>very</b> elderly <b>patients</b> with intravenous thrombolytic therapy (IVT). For <b>very</b> elderly <b>patients</b> ineligible or non-responsive to IVT, intra-arterial therapy (IAT) may have promise in improving clinical outcome. However, its unequivocal efficacy {{in the general population}} remains to be proven in randomized trials. Small cohort studies reveal that the rate of good clinical outcome for <b>very</b> elderly <b>patients</b> after IAT is highly variable, ranging from 2 % to 28 %. In addition, they experience higher rates of futile reperfusion than younger patients. Thus it is imperative to understand the factors that impact on clinical outcome in <b>very</b> elderly <b>patients</b> after IAT. The aim of this review is to examine the factors that may be responsible for the heterogeneous clinical response of the very elderly to IAT. This will allow the reader to integrate the current available evidence to individualize intra-arterial stroke therapy in <b>very</b> elderly <b>patients.</b> Placing emphasis on pre-stroke independent living, smaller infarct core size, short procedure times, and avoiding general anesthesia where feasible, will help improve rates of good clinical outcome...|$|R

40|$|International audienceABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Noninvasive {{ventilation}} (NIV) {{is frequently}} {{used for the}} management of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in <b>very</b> old <b>patients</b> (> 80 years), often {{in the context of a}} do-not-intubate order (DNI). We aimed to determine its efficacy and long-term outcome. METHODS: Prospective cohort of all patients admitted to the medical ICU of a tertiary hospital during a 2 -year period and managed using NIV. Characteristics of patients, context of NIV, and treatment intensity were compared for very old and younger patients. Six-month survival and functional status were assessed in <b>very</b> old <b>patients.</b> RESULTS: During the study period, 1, 019 patients needed ventilatory support and 376 (37 %) received NIV. Among them, 163 (16 %) <b>very</b> old <b>patients</b> received ventilatory support with 60 % of them managed using NIV compared with 32 % of younger patients (p < 0. 0001). <b>Very</b> old <b>patients</b> received NIV more frequently with DNI than in younger patients (40 % vs. 8 %). Such cases were associated with high mortality for both very old and younger patients. Hospital mortality was higher in very old than in younger patients but did not differ when NIV was used for cardiogenic pulmonary edema or acute-on-chronic respiratory failure (20 % vs. 15 %) and in postextubation (15 % vs. 17 %) out of a context of DNI. Six-month mortality was 51 % in <b>very</b> old <b>patients,</b> 67 % for DNI patients, and 77 % in case of NIV failure and endotracheal intubation. Of the 30 hospital survivors, 22 lived at home and 13 remained independent for activities of daily living. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Very</b> old <b>patients</b> managed using NIV have an overall satisfactory 6 -month survival and functional status, except for endotracheal intubation after NIV failure...|$|R

2500|$|The October {{issue of}} Star of the West made room for remembering him while news {{continued}} of `Abdu'l-Bahá's travels and speeches and {{dedication of the}} cite for the Bahá'í House of Worship near Chicago. It included a long poem Chase composed. This poem arrived in Egypt and was read to `Abdu'l-Bahá July 4, 1913. The Star of the West edition also published letters from various communities memorializing him. Tributes from Portland, OR and Chicago were also published, followed in March, 1913, by one from Beirut which included remembrance {{of those who were}} on pilgrimage and met him in 1907. A letter/poem/ode from him to `Abdu'l-Bahá was published in September, 1913 dated from August, 1912, published as a one year anniversary of the visit of `Abdu'l-Baha to his gravesite and was re-printed in 1922. The editors noted the observance held for what was called [...] "The day of Thornton Chase". It also reported more of the words `Abdu'l-Bahá had said on the visit to the gravesite:"…During his lifetime he bore many trials and vicissitudes, but he was <b>very</b> <b>patient</b> and long-suffering. He had a heart most illuminated, a spirit most rejoiced; his hope was to serve the world of humanity; during the days of his life he strove {{as much as he could}} – he never failed…" [...] There was an article then published including a picture marking Chase among the people standing at a Ridván meeting in May, 1909, who lead the services that day and compared the tent raised as a precursor to the eventual building. It also included a short article by Chase [...] "The Greatest Name". An account of that first year anniversary followed in the November edition. 10 Bahá'ís attended the gravesite Sep 30th with flowers and prayers for an hour and a service was held the following Sunday in a hall which was also the anniversary of `Abdu'l-Bahá's visit and the assemblage again returned to the gravesite at sunset. A memorial comment was then published from Thomas Kelly Cheyne. In February 1914, an excerpt from Chase's book The Bahai Revelation was published in Star of the West. The anniversary was noted again in 1914, and then an article briefly reviewing the history of the religion in America by Chase was published in early 1915, and again noted the anniversary in September. A more enduring gravestone was placed in 1918. A memoriam article in 1918 noted 21 Bahá'ís attended the anniversary meeting which also saw the new stone marker. Mrs. Chase attended and shared anecdotes of his life. A picture of the gravestone was published in 1920.|$|E
