25|$|Nuclear {{reprocessing}} {{does not}} reduce {{the volume of}} high-level waste, it separates out the useful isotopes leaving an increased <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> high-level waste {{as a result of}} the solution-based chemical processes used to dissolve fuel rods and extract useful isotopes. It does reduce total radioactivity of the total waste, however the overall volume of the waste is higher and it does not eliminate waste nor heat generation and therefore does not eliminate the need for a geological waste repository. Reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to nuclear proliferation, the potential vulnerability to nuclear terrorism, the political challenges of repository siting (a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel), the environmental risks of the aqueous and organic waste streams, and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle. In the United States, the Obama administration stepped back from President Bush's plans for commercial-scale reprocessing and reverted to a program focused on reprocessing-related scientific research. Nuclear fuel reprocessing is performed routinely in Europe, Russia and Japan.|$|E

2500|$|Reactions [...] and [...] are {{extremely}} exothermic (the catalyst chamber can reach 800°C {{in a matter}} of milliseconds,) and they produce large volumes of hot gas from a small <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid,</b> making hydrazine a fairly efficient thruster propellant with a vacuum specific impulse of about 220 seconds. [...] Reaction 3 is endothermic and so reduces the temperature of the products, but also produces a greater number of molecules. The catalyst structure affects the proportion of the NH3 that is dissociated in Reaction 3; a higher temperature is desirable for rocket thrusters, while more molecules are desirable when the reactions are intended to produce greater quantities of gas.|$|E

An advantage of the new approach is that it reveals differences between mixtures of molecules with different steric characteristics, and shows that steric effects related to molecular shape and rigidity are necessary components of a fundamental understanding <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> mixtures. ...|$|R

2500|$|Use of {{condensers}} {{in chemical}} procedures—when not performed at fixed, lowered pressure by careful vacuum control—inevitably involves transiently fluctuating pressures within the apparatus, so that isolating the apparatus while {{allowing it to}} be an open rather than sealed system becomes a practical issue; this is particularly true, when chemical reactions are performed that are air- or moisture-sensitive. If the reaction or process using condensers cannot be left open to atmosphere, its isolation is accomplished in simplest fashion via drying tubes (an attached tube packed with desiccant) or other specially packed scavenging tubes, that allows gasses to pass, and so pressure equalization, but prevents entry of substances deleterious to the ongoing chemistry; alternatively, the apparatus can be vented through a [...] "bubbler" [...] that prevents entry of laboratory atmosphere either by allowing the internal volume to push and pull against a volume of resisting liquid (e.g., mineral or silicone oil), or by keeping a positive pressure of inert, [...] "blanketing" [...] gas (e.g., nitrogen or argon) that vents through a similar <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid.</b> Attachment of such during tubes and bubblers can be direct, or indirect via gas/vacuum lines and manifolds.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> refrigerant in {{the compressor}} cylinder during operation, or liquid slugging, {{is one of}} the most common causes of failure in reciprocating compressors. We propose to detect this fault by analyzing the electrical current flowing into the compressor and identifying the change in the load on the motor caused by the presence <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> in the compressor cylinder. Two different types <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> slugging are examined in this paper. In the first, small <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> are ingested during the steady-state operation of the compressor; in the second, small <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> are present at the suction port of the compressor immediately prior to the compressor start.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a RF biosensor {{able to perform}} analysis on nano <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquids</b> or on flowing colloidal solutions. Once properly calibrated this sensor allows measuring the intrinsic dielectric properties <b>of</b> unknown <b>liquid</b> medium and even individual characteristics of flowing particles. In the aim to guide the liquid and precisely locate the dielectric particles to analyze, a microfluidic network has been developed and implemented on the RF sensor. First characterizations done on small <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquids</b> with our sensor have showed a good agreement with macro measurements done using a coaxial probe. To demonstrate its sensing capabilities, a 3 D electromagnetic simulation of the developed sensor {{in the presence of}} polystyrene beads located in the sensing area has been performed and results in potential high detection sensitivity.
