40|$|A space {{power system}} concept was {{evaluated}} which uses concentrated solar energy to heat a working fluid to temperatures {{as high as}} 4000 K. The high temperature working fluid {{could be used for}} efficient electric power production in advanced thermal or magnetohydrodynamic conversion cycles. Energy absorber configurations utilizing particles or cesium <b>vapor</b> <b>absorber</b> material were investigaed. Results of detailed radiant heat transfer calculations indicated approximately 86 percent of the incident solar energy could be absorbed within a 12 -cm-dia flowing stream of gas borne carbon particles. Calculated total energy absorption in the cesium vapor seeded absorber configuration ranged from 34 percent to 64 percent of the incident solar energy. Solar flux concentration ratios of between approximately 3000 and 10, 000 will be required to sustain absorber temperatures in the range from 3000 K to 4000 K...|$|E

40|$|Absorption space-conditioning {{systems are}} {{environmentally}} benign alternatives to vapor compression systems {{and have the}} capability of being driven by waste heat. However, a lack of practically feasible and economically viable compact heat and mass exchangers is a major limitation {{in the success of}} this technology. The viability of the absorption cycle depends upon the performance of the absorber, which experiences large heat and mass transfer resistances due to adverse temperature and concentration gradients during the phase change of the binary mixture working fluid, resulting in large overall component sizes. Understanding of the coupled heat and mass transfer during binary fluid mixture absorption at the microscales is critical for the miniaturization of these components, which will enable broad implementation of this technology. The proposed study aims to achieve this by investigating ammonia-water absorption for two distinct flow configurations: external falling films and internal convective flows. For the falling-film absorption case, ammonia-water solution flows around an array of small diameter coolant tubes while absorbing <b>vapor.</b> This <b>absorber</b> is installed in a test facility comprising all components of a single-effect absorption chiller to provide realistic operating conditions at the absorber. Local temperature, pressure, and flow measurements will be taken over a wide range of operating conditions and analyzed to develop a heat and mass transfer model for falling-film ammonia-water absorption. A microscale convective flow absorber will also be investigated. This absorber consists of an array of parallel, aligned alternating shims with integral microscale features, enclosed between cover plates. These microscale features facilitate flow of various fluid streams and the associated heat and mass transfer. The use of microchannels induces high heat and mass transfer rates without any active or passive surface enhancement. The microscale absorber for small-scale applications will be evaluated over a wide range of operating conditions on a single-effect absorption heat pump breadboard test facility. The study will conclude with a comparison of the two flow configurations for absorption, with recommendations for their application in future miniaturization effortsPhDCommittee Chair: Garimella.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. Absorption heat pump systems (AHP) are one candidate of attractive technologies to upgrade and utilize exhaust heat of low temperature level for refrigeration or heating up without emitting global warming gas. This work is to propose the method to form fine-particle slurry of LiBr crystal and {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the slurry for advancement of the absorption performance in LiBr/water AHP. It was found that the fine particle slurry of LiBr crystal is formed stably in the solution under a super saturation condition when zeolite powder is suspended. This phenomenon is considered to take place since the crystal grows around the zeolite particles by a function as nucleus. Then almost saturated concentration is maintained due to dissolution of the crystal even if the solution is diluted by absorption of water <b>vapor</b> in the <b>absorber.</b> The theoretical analysis based on heat and mass transfer model predicted that the output power of AHP was improved up to twice when compared with the conventional solution in lower concentration than saturation solubility without containing any fine powder of adsorbent or crystal. The measurement of the slurry properties and experiment on heat transfer of slurry film flowing on a heat transfer plate was carried out, and the effectiveness of the slurry as well as the reasonability of the modeling was confirmed. dc 201...|$|R
40|$|Precipitating {{amino acid}} {{solvents}} are {{an alternative to}} conventional amine scrubbing for CO 2 capture from flue gas. Process operation with these solvents leads {{to the formation of}} precipitates during absorption that need to be re-dissolved prior to desorption of CO 2. The process configuration is crucial for the successful application of these solvents. Different process configurations have been analyzed in this work, including a full analysis of the baseline operating conditions (based on potassium taurate), the addition of lean <b>vapor</b> compression, multiple <b>absorber</b> feeds, and the use of different amino acids as alternative solvents to the baseline based on potassium taurate. The analysis is carried out with an equilibrium model of the process that approximates the thermodynamics of the solvents considered. The results show that the precipitating amino acid solvents can reduce the reboiler duty needed to regenerate the solvent with respect to a conventional MEA process. However, this reduction is accompanied by an expenditure in lower grade energy needed to dissolve the precipitates. To successfully implement these processes into power plants, an internal recycle of the rich stream is necessary. This configuration, known as DECAB Plus, can lower the overall energy use of the capture process, which includes the energy needed to regenerate the solvent, the energy needed to dissolve the precipitates, and the energy needed to compress the CO 2 to 110 bar. With respect to the energy efficiency, the DECAB Plus with lean vapor compression configuration is the best configuration based on potassium taurate, which reduces the reboiler duty for regeneration by 45 % with respect to conventional MEA. Retrofitting this process into a coal fired power plant will result in overall energy savings of 15 % with respect to the conventional MEA process, including compression of the CO 2 stream to 110 bar. Potassium alanate was found to reduce the energy use with respect to potassium taurate under similar process configurations. Therefore, the investigation of potassium alanate in a DECAB Plus configuration is highly recommended, since it can reduce the energy requirements of the best process configuration based on potassium taurat...|$|R
