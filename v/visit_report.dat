In 2013 it was reported by Down to Earth that the plan was [...] "mired in controversy following allegations that the company concealed information about the presence of forestland and endangered wildlife at the project site. The farmers in the region have also been protesting against the project, alleging the company bought land for the project by cheating them." [...] Debadityo Sinha, founder of VENHF in his articles claimed that the project will be a threat to river Ganga and the upper Khajuri Reservoir for drinking and irrigation. It was apprehended that the project if comes into existence will also threat a historic waterfall of Mirzapur known as Wyndham Fall and will also jeopardise the drinking water supply of the newly established Rajiv Gandhi South campus of Banaras Hindu University. He also made an allegation that the Public Hearing process for the project was greatly compromised and local people were prohibited from entering the public hearing premises. In a research paper published by VENHF in an international open source scientific journal Present Environment and Sustainable Development of Walter de Gruyter in its October, 2015 edition, the land use land cover map of the project site submitted by the company is contradicted.|$|E

Such visits seem designed more to demonstrate the supervisor's authority than to help the field worker to serve local people better. This manual is designed to help field supervisors supervise in a way that deepens insights into local situations, supports health workers, and focuses on improving the quality of service to the poor. The checklist of questions is not intended to be definitive or rigidly applied. Depending on the needs of a given program, some areas may need to be probed more deeply, and others shortened or omitted altogether. The author provides guidelines for: planning visits to a program area; visiting villages and talking with mothers; visiting health care workers; visiting nutrition workers; and using findings to make changes in program design or implementation, to reorient the way supervision is done, and to change worker behavior.

The visits focused on work with smallholder farmers since, according to the <b>visit</b> <b>report,</b> 'considering that small-grain and other indigenous crops hold the key to household and national food security, denying smallholders continuous availability of high-quality seeds implies that food security will remain unattainable.

Much of the information is technical, but it also encompasses socioeconomic aspects in management decision-making.
