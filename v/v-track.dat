For example, track followers are available with a V-groove for following a <b>V-track,</b> or the OD can have a flange to follow {{the lip of the}} track.|$|E
40|$|The tagging {{of aquatic}} and {{semi-aquatic}} animals with acoustic transmitters and their detection by passive underwater receivers has gained huge popularity {{over the past}} decade. This technology offers researchers the opportunity to monitor the finite-to broad-scale movements of multiple individuals over many years; however, the sheer scale and spatial complexity of these datasets are often beyond the capabilities of routine database and spread-sheet applications. In the present paper, we describe software (<b>V-Track)</b> that greatly facilitates the assimilation, analysis and synthesis of animal-location data collected by underwater passive acoustic receivers. The principal features within <b>V-Track</b> are the behavioural event qualifier (BEQ) and the receiver-distance matrix (RDM) calculator. The BEQ identifies and catalogues horizontal movements from receiver detection data, or vertical movements from transmitter sensor data (depth or temperature). The RDMis generated from the geographical location of the acoustic receivers and is utilised by <b>V-Track</b> to illustrate the behavioural event information in a spatial context. <b>V-Track</b> is a package written within the R-programming language, and a graphical user interface is also provided. Here, we feature two case studies to demonstrate software functionality for defining and quantifying behaviour in acoustically tagged marine and freshwater vertebrates...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} two decades, it became largely {{accepted}} that monkeys show little, if any, copying fidelity. However, some recent studies have begun to challenge this notion. To explore reasons for such contrary findings, we designed a foraging apparatus so that in each of two experiments with capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella), a model would demonstrate one of two alternative methods to obtain food. The apparatus had a V-shaped track on which a panel could be slid up left or right from the center to reveal food. In Experiment 1, food was located in a cup directly behind the center panel. In Experiment 2, sliding the panel left or right revealed food either in left or right ends of the <b>V-track.</b> Since this sliding movement led directly to one food location exclusive of the other, we predicted capuchins would show greater copying fidelity in this second Experiment. Instead, subjects were significantly more faithful to the model's method in Experiment 1, which provided strong evidence of capuchins copying what they had observed. We suggest that the contrasting results of Experiment 1 may have occurred because capuchins prioritize exploratory behavior when alternative foraging locations are accessible...|$|E
