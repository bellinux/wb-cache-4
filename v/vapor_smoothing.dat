40|$|Fused {{deposition}} modelling (FDM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used cost-effective additive manufacturing (AM) technique for modelling and prototyping of functional/non-functional parts subjected to different industrial applications. However, this technique still possesses substantial problems in-terms of poor surface finish and dimensional accuracy of the prototypes. In the present research work, an effort has been made to improve the surface finish of FDM based benchmarks through chemical (acetone) exposure by using <b>vapor</b> <b>smoothing</b> station (VSS). Experimental analysis has been carried out by using design of experiments (DOE) technique in-order to find out the effect of input factors on surface finish of the benchmarks. The results of the present study highlights the capability of the VSS for improving the surface finish of the FDM based parts to nano-level with negligible dimensional deviations...|$|E
40|$|We {{completed}} {{the development of}} a method for preparing smooth vapor deposited polyimide (PI) up to 160 {micro}m thick for NIF target capsules. The process consists of two steps. The first step is vacuum chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of monomer species, pyromelletic dianhydride and oxidianaline, which react on the surface of a shell to form short chain oligomers of polyamic acid. In the second step solvent vapor exposure in a gas levitation apparatus swells and fluidizes the outer surface. Roughness in the outer fluid layer is reduced by surface-tension-driven flow. The shells are cured in the final smoothing step by heating to 300 C reacting the polyamic acid to polyimide. Recent experiments using x-ray radiography have allowed us to determine the depth of solvent penetration and the solvent concentration over a range of solvent exposure conditions. We found that the rate of penetration {{is a function of the}} solvent partial pressure in the flowing vapor stream. The concentration of solvent in the swollen layer is 0. 45 g/cc and is independent of exposure conditions. Using the penetration information we were able to improve the smoothing process by increasing the solvent partial pressure. The optimized <b>vapor</b> <b>smoothing</b> process allowed us to consistently meet the smoothness specifications of NIF capsules...|$|E
50|$|Acetone {{is often}} used for vapor {{polishing}} of printing artifacts on 3D-printed models printed with ABS plastic. The technique, called acetone <b>vapor</b> bath <b>smoothing,</b> involves placing the printed part in a sealed chamber containing {{a small amount of}} acetone, and heating to around 80 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes. This creates a vapor of acetone in the container. The acetone condenses evenly all over the part, causing the surface to soften and liquefy. Surface tension then smooths the semi-liquid plastic. When the part is removed from the chamber, the acetone component evaporates leaving a glassy-smooth part free of striation, patterning, and visible layer edges, common features in untreated 3D printed parts.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} direct liquid injectionCVDof {{aluminum}} oxide and oxycarbide thin films using dimethylaluminum isopropoxide at high process temperature (500 – 700 8 C) {{with the addition}} ofO 2 gas, and at low temperature (150 – 300 8 C) {{with the addition of}} H 2 O <b>vapor.</b> Very <b>smooth</b> films with typical roughness values lower than 2 nm are obtained. The thin films are composed of an amorphous material. The composition evolves as a function of temperature from that of a partial hydroxide to a stoichiometric oxide at low deposition temperature(150 – 300 8 C), and from that of a stoichiometric oxide to a mixture of an oxide with an(oxy) carbide at higher temperature (500 – 700 8 C) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: With {{specular}} and off-specular X-ray scattering {{the surface}} morphology in terms of surface roughness, film quality, and roughness correlation in thin polymer films of polystyrene and fully brominated polystyrene is measured. During {{the preparation of the}} thin films on top of silicon substrates, the common solvent was varied. We investigated eight different solvents and three different solvent mixtures to depict the influence of typical solvent parameters. In the regime of a small solvent vapor pressure, we observed correlated roughness as the ultimate lower limit of accessible surface smoothness. The resulting films are homogeneous, and the surface roughness is given by the substrate. In an intermediate vapor pressure regime marked surface morphologies are detected, while at a high <b>vapor</b> pressure <b>smoother</b> films result again...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} Part II of a two-part study devoted to {{measurement}} and prediction of the saturated flow {{boiling heat transfer}} coefficient in water-cooled micro-channel heat sinks. Part I discussed the experimental findings from the study, and identified unique aspects of flow boiling in micro-channels such as abrupt transition to the annular flow regime near the point of zero thermodynamic equilibrium quality, and the decrease in heat transfer coefficient with increasing quality. The operating conditions of water-cooled micro-channels fell outside the recommended range for most prior empirical correlations. In this paper, an annular flow model is developed to predict the saturated flow boiling heat transfer coefficient. Features unique to two-phase micro-channel flow, such as laminar liquid and <b>vapor</b> flow, <b>smooth</b> interface, and strong droplet entrainment and deposition effects, are identified and incorporated into the model. The model correctly captures the unique overall trend of decreasing heat transfer coefficient with increasing vapor quality in the low vapor quality region of micro-channels. Good agreement is achieved between the model predictions and heat transfer coefficient data over broad ranges of flow rate and heat flux...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} new {{experimental results}} for Normafluid ISO 4113. Vapor pressures of Normafluid were measured from 0. 001 kPa to 27 kPa and from 273 to 463 K, using a static apparatus. The experimental <b>vapor</b> pressures were <b>smoothed</b> using the Antoine equation. Air solubility in the fuel at 288 K, 298 K and 308 K {{and up to}} 0. 8 MPa was also determined. Isobaric thermal expansivitites of Normafluid were determined over the temperature range from 273. 15 K to 423. 15 K at pressures up to 200 MPa using scanning transitiometry; therefrom thermodynamic relations were used to obtain the isobaric specific heat capacities, specific volumes, isothermal compressibilities, isentropic compressibilities and isentropic bulk modulus over wide pressure and temperature ranges...|$|R
40|$|Convective {{condensation}} of pure ethanol <b>vapor</b> {{inside a}} <b>smooth</b> tube of inner diameter 4. 8 mm and of length 200 mm is studied. The experiments {{have been carried}} out at temperature 58 °C corresponding to the pressure of 440 mbar, the vapor mass velocity varying from 0. 24 to 2. 04 kg/(m 2 s). The dependency of the Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) is investigated experimentally both subject to the temperature difference between the saturated vapor and the wall and subject to the condenser inclination. The results show that the HTC reduces with growth of the temperature difference. The dependency of the HTC on inclination has a maximum in the range 15 °- 35 ° due to the complex gravity drainage mechanism of the condensed liquid. The results could be useful for development of compact effective cooling systems for space and ground application. © Springer Science+Business Media B. V. 2011.

40|$|Single-crystal stable-temperature (ST) -cut quartz substrates, {{which have}} a (0 1 1 1) crystallographic plane with their surface normal lying close to 38 ° from the y axis ([0 1 0]), were {{annealed}} in air prior {{to use as a}} support for aligned carbon nanotube growth by chemical <b>vapor</b> deposition. Very <b>smooth</b> substrate surfaces were obtained with annealing times in the vicinity of 15 h at a temperature of 750 ° C. These smooth surfaces are ideal for the growth of horizontally aligned SWCNTs with high spatial density, while less dense SWCNTs were obtained with less smooth surfaces. Under optimized growth conditions, only SWCNT are observed and they can grow to lengths in excess of 100 lm. Our findings suggest structural defects interfere with the growth process. A binary Fe/Co catalyst was employed to grow the nanotubes. No obvious dependence on the Fe: Co ratio is observed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Drops {{of water}} at room {{temperature}} were released in hot oil, which had a temperature {{higher than that of}} the boiling point of water. Initially, the drop temperature increases slowly mainly due to heat transfer diffusion; convective heat transfer is small because the motion takes place at a small Reynolds number. Once the drop reaches the bottom of the container, it sticks to the surface with a certain contact angle. Then, a part of the drop vaporizes: the nucleation point may appear at the wall, the interface or the bulk of the drop. The vapor expands inside the drop and deforms its interface. The way in which the <b>vapor</b> expands, either <b>smooth</b> or violent, depends on the location of the nucleation point and oil temperature. Furthermore, for temperatures close to the boiling point of water, the drops are stable (overheated); the vaporization does not occur spontaneously but it may be triggered with an external perturbation. In this case the growth of the vapor bubble is rather violent. Many visualization for different conditions will be shown and predictions of the growth rate will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} in situ spectroellipsometric {{analysis of the}} nucleation and growth of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a:Si:H) is presented. Photoelectronic quality a‐Si:H films are deposited by plasma‐enhanced chemical <b>vapor</b> deposition on <b>smooth</b> metal (NiCr alloy) and crystalline silicon (c‐Si) substrates. The deposition of a‐Si:H is analyzed from the first monolayer up to a final thickness of 1. 2 μm. In order to perform an improved analysis, real time ellipsometric trajectories are recorded, using fixed preparation conditions, at various photon energies ranging from 2. 2 to 3. 6 eV. The advantage of using such a spectroscopic experimental procedure is underlined. New insights into the nucleation and growth mechanisms of a‐Si:H are obtained. The nucleation mechanism on metal and c‐Si substrates is very accurately described assuming a columnar microstructural development during the early stage of the growth. Then, {{as a consequence of}} the incomplete coalescence of the initial nuclei, a surface roughness at the 10 - 15 Å scale is identified during the further growth of a‐Si:H on both substrates. The bulk a‐Si:H grows homogeneously beneath the surface roughness. Finally, an increase of the surface roughness is evidenced during the long term growth of a‐Si:H. However, the nature of the substrate influenced the film growth. In particular, the film thickness involved in the nucleation‐coalescence phase is found lower in the case of c‐Si (67 ± 8 Å) as compared to NiCr (118 ± 22 Å). Likewise films deposited on c‐Si present a smaller surface roughness even if thick samples are considered (> 1 μm). More generally, the present study illustrates the capability of in situ spectroellipsometry to precisely analyze fundamental processes in thin‐film growth, but also to monitor the preparation of complex structures on a few monolayers scale...|$|R
40|$|Color {{images of}} steady state water <b>vapor</b> {{condensing}} on <b>smooth</b> and nanostructured hydrophobic surfaces are presented. Figure 1 a shows {{a snapshot of}} classical filmwise condensation on hydrophilic copper. A thin liquid film forms on the high surface energy substrate and acts as a conduction barrier for heat transfer. Figure 1 b shows dropwise condensation on a copper tube made hydrophobic via deposition of a tri-chloro silane (TFTS). Discrete droplets form on the surface and, upon reaching a size comparable to the capillary length (≈ 2. 7 mm), depart from the surface by gravitational sweeping. Figure 1 c shows jumping-droplet condensation on a nanostructured superhydrophobic copper oxide (CuO) surface. When droplets coalesce on this surface, the resulting droplet can jump due {{to the release of}} excess surface energy (Figure 2 b), and as a result, rapid droplet jumping is observed at micrometric length scales (R < 20 μm). Figure 1 d shows a novel mode of condensation called ‘immersion’ condensation, where nucleation density is drastically increased while maintaining easy condensate removal (R < 500 μm) and low contact angles (< 120 ˚). This approach utilizes an oil-infused nanostructured CuO surface with a heterogeneous coating which allows droplets to nucleate immersed within the oil (Figure 2 c). The increase in nucleation density is achieved due to the combined effect of surface energy heterogeneity and a reduced oil-water interfacial energy. Figure 2 a shows a schematic of the experimental setup. The visualizations provide insight into the complex droplet-surface interactions, which are important for the development of enhanced phase change surfaces. If designed properly, these surfaces not only allow for easy droplet removal at micrometric length scales during condensation but also promise to enhance heat transfer performance...|$|R
40|$|Deposition {{of highly}} {{conformal}} alumina thin films onto various substrates {{was carried out}} by hydrolysis of AlH 3 (NMe 2 Et) in a hot-wall atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) system. Optimum growth conditions were at 165 °C with a AlH 3 (NMe 2 Et) :H 2 O ratio of less than 1 : 25. Films were characterized by SEM, microprobe and electrical conductivity measurements. Deposition of hermetic coatings onto ZnS EL-phosphor particles was accomplished in a simple fluidized-bed APCVD reactor. Chromium-doped alumina (ruby) thin films were deposited onto sapphire substrates using a mixture of Al(acac) 3 and Cr(acac) 3 precursors with added oxygen sources. APCVD with water <b>vapor</b> resulted in <b>smooth</b> films that were visibly colored following thermal annealing. Substituting water vapor with [Me 2 Al(mu-OiPr) ] 2 in vacuo increased growth rates and produced films with improved color homogeneity. The observed intensity of the ruby fluorescence was found to increase with post-deposition annealing. The sublimation enthalpies for a variety of metal beta-diketonate compounds were determined using thermogravimetric analysis. Replacing methyl groups with CF 3 units increased the volatility of the particular complex in the order acac < tfac < hfac. The refinement of the Al:Cr site occupancy in mixed AlxCr y(acac) 3 crystals was accomplished by various methods. Refinement of occupancy with common displacement parameters and refinement of both occupancy and displacement parameters were found to agree with WDS data within experimental error for all crystals studied. A facile chalcogenide exchange is observed for the reaction of [(tBu) Ga(mu 3 -Te) ] 4 with elemental sulfur or selenium, resulting in the stoichiometric formation of the appropriate cubane, [(tBu) Ga(mu 3 -E) ] 4 (E = S, Se), and metallic tellurium. The rate of the chalcogenide exchange is dependent not only on the chalcogen, but also the allotropic form of the chalcogen. The exchange reaction is proposed to be heterogeneous in nature and involves the opening of the cubane core. The reaction of [(R) Ga(mu 3 -Te) ] 4 with an oxygen source ultimately produces the galloxane nonamer or hexamer, {{depending on the size of}} the alkyl group. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the experimental observations and mechanistic proposals for chalcogenide exchange reactions. The intermediate species formed during sequential oxygen exchanges are predicted to have extremely distorted and relatively unstable structures allowing for the rearrangement to larger galloxane cages...|$|R
