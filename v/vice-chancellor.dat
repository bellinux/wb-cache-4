5|$|In {{common with}} most UK universities, Bristol is headed {{formally}} by the chancellor, currently Sir Paul Nurse and led {{on a day-to-day}} basis by the <b>vice-chancellor,</b> currently Hugh Brady, who is the academic leader and chief executive. There are four pro vice-chancellors and three ceremonial pro-chancellors. The chancellor may hold office for up to ten years and the pro-chancellors for up to three, unless the University Court determines otherwise, but the <b>vice-chancellor</b> and pro-vice-chancellors have no term limits. The <b>vice-chancellor</b> is supported by a deputy <b>vice-chancellor.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a collegiate university, Oxford's {{structure}} can {{be confusing}} to those unfamiliar with it. The university is a federation, comprising over forty self-governing colleges and halls, {{along with a}} central administration headed by the <b>Vice-Chancellor.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 2015 it was {{announced}} that Professor G.Q. Max Lu would become the University's fifth President and <b>Vice-Chancellor,</b> taking up his appointment in April 2016.

5|$|The Principal acts as {{the chief}} {{executive}} officer of the university under the authority of the Board and the Senate, and supervises and directs the academic and administrative work of the university and of its teaching and non-teaching staff. Since 1974, principals have been appointed for five-year terms, renewable subject to review. The formal authority for the appointment of the Principal rests under the Royal Charter with the Board of Trustees although recent principals have been selected by a joint committee of trustees and senators. Daniel Woolf has served as the twentieth principal, serving since 1 September 2009. The office of the <b>vice-chancellor</b> has typically been held by the incumbent principal. In 1961, an amendment was secured by the Board to separate the office of principal from <b>vice-chancellor</b> if it wished. The first, and only person to ever hold the office of <b>vice-chancellor,</b> but not the office of principal, was William Archibald Mackintosh.|$|E
5|$|Bristol is {{a member}} of the Russell Group of research-intensive British universities, the European-wide Coimbra Group and the Worldwide Universities Network, of which the university's {{previous}} <b>vice-chancellor,</b> Eric Thomas, was chairman from 2005 to 2007.

5000|$|In 1918 {{the first}} consultative meeting of all <b>vice-chancellors</b> was held. At that time, the {{committee}} consisted of just twenty-two universities and university colleges. In 1930, under {{the chairmanship of}} Sir Charles Grant Robertson, <b>vice-chancellors</b> secured a mandate from their respective universities that [...] "it is desirable in the common interests of the United Kingdom to constitute a Committee of <b>Vice-Chancellors</b> and Principals for purposes of mutual consultation".|$|R
5|$|Heffron {{introduced}} the University of New England Act {{to the state}} parliament in early December 1953.

Madgwick assumed the office of first <b>Vice-Chancellor.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Executive Board is {{the senior}} {{advisory}} body which assists the President and <b>Vice-Chancellor</b> in discharging his executive authority to manage the operations and affairs of the University. It is responsible for advising on all matters relating to the University's strategy and for making recommendations to Council for approval.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} period, the Court was also {{assisted}} by two Registrars, who enrolled decrees {{of the court}} and orders; their books documented the legal precedent set by the court. At the same time, two Examiners were appointed to assist the Master of the Rolls in examining witnesses. The positions were regularly and openly sold by the Master of the Rolls and Lord Chancellor– Masters in Chancery went for £6,000 in 1625. To avoid the sale of offices, and due to the corruption of many court officials, an Act was passed that year requiring that fees be paid directly into the Bank of England, and creating an Accountant-General to oversee the financial aspects of the court. In 1813 the first <b>Vice-Chancellor</b> was appointed {{to deal with the}} increasing number of cases submitted to the Court. With the backlog growing larger, two more were appointed in 1841 under a second Act of Parliament, although this provided for two life appointments, not two new positions; when the new Vice-Chancellors died, there could be no replacements. With the dissolution of the Court in 1873, the position of <b>Vice-Chancellor</b> ceased to exist.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, the Madras University Act {{was passed}} after its {{introduction}} by Education Minister A. P. Patro. Under the bill's provisions, the governing body of Madras University was completely reorganised on democratic lines. The bill {{asserted that the}} governing body would henceforth be headed by a Chancellor who would be assisted by a pro-Chancellor, usually the Minister of Education. Apart from the Chancellor and the pro-Chancellor who were elected, {{there was to be}} a <b>Vice-Chancellor</b> appointed by the Chancellor.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Hertford College, Cruttwell was elected to a {{fellowship}} in modern history {{and a year later}} was appointed Hertford's Dean, responsible for general discipline within the college; he held this post for five years. He also became active in the administration of Oxford University and was elected to its ruling body, the Hebdomadal Council. He served as a university statutory commissioner and was one of several academics nominated by the <b>Vice-Chancellor</b> as delegates to the Oxford University Press.|$|E
5|$|The Senate is {{responsible}} for determining all academic matters affecting the university as a whole, including student discipline.

The Chair of the Senate is the President and <b>Vice-Chancellor</b> of the University.|$|E
5|$|The {{failed attempt}} to kill Bond while at Royale-Les-Eaux was {{inspired}} by Fleming's knowledge of the attempted assassination of Franz von Papen, <b>Vice-Chancellor</b> of Germany and an ambassador under Hitler. Both Papen and Bond survived their assassination attempts, carried out by Bulgarians, because trees protected them from the blasts. The torture scene in which Bond's genitals are thrashed while he is strapped to a bottomless chair was a version of a French-Moroccan torture technique, , in which the steel string of a mandolin was used to slice in half the testicles of British wartime agents.|$|E
5|$|The regime did {{not limit}} {{itself to a}} purge of the SA. Having earlier imprisoned or exiled {{prominent}} Social Democrats and Communists, Hitler used the occasion to move against conservatives he considered unreliable. This included <b>Vice-Chancellor</b> Papen and those in his immediate circle. In Berlin, on Göring's personal orders, an armed SS unit stormed the Vice-Chancellery. Gestapo officers attached to the SS unit shot Papen's secretary Herbert von Bose without bothering to arrest him first. The Gestapo arrested and later executed Papen's close associate Edgar Jung, the author of Papen's Marburg speech; they disposed of his body by dumping it in a ditch. The Gestapo also murdered Erich Klausener, the leader of Catholic Action, and a close Papen associate. Papen was unceremoniously arrested at the Vice-Chancellery, despite his insistent protests {{that he could not}} be arrested in his position as <b>Vice-Chancellor.</b> Although Hitler ordered him released days later, Papen no longer dared to criticise the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador.|$|E

5|$|Ashurst Turner Gilbert {{was elected}} Principal in 1822, aged only 35; he had secured the {{fellowship}} in 1809 {{on the strength}} of a first. He disliked teaching – although he admitted it paid the bills – and much preferred being Principal. There, he would be eventually made <b>Vice-Chancellor</b> of the University and later Bishop of Chichester. Gilbert committed Brasenose to a cause of neutral politics and mainstream Anglicanism, strongly rejecting Tractarian and Evangelical ideas including supporting the censure of Dr. Renn D. Hampden. His time was spent pre-occupied with the religious tensions of the University, having spent time opposing changes to religious services in Oxford on behalf of Oxford Tories.|$|E
5|$|At {{nine o'clock}} in the morning, {{students}} began gathering on the University of Dhaka premises in defiance of Section 144. The university <b>vice-chancellor</b> and other officials were present as armed police surrounded the campus. By a quarter past eleven, students gathered at the university gate and attempted to break the police line. Police fired tear gas shells towards the gate to warn the students. A section of students ran into the Dhaka Medical College while others rallied towards the university premises cordoned by the police. The <b>vice-chancellor</b> asked police to stop firing and ordered the students to leave the area. However, the police arrested several students for violating section 144 as they attempted to leave. Enraged by the arrests, the students met around the East Bengal Legislative Assembly and blocked the legislators' way, asking them to present their insistence at the assembly. When {{a group of students}} sought to storm into the building, police opened fire and killed a number of students, including Abdus Salam, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Abul Barkat and Abdul Jabbar. As the news of the killings spread, disorder erupted across the city. Shops, offices and public transport were shut down and a general strike began. At the assembly, six legislators including Manoranjan Dhar, Boshontokumar Das, Shamsuddin Ahmed and Dhirendranath Datta requested that chief minister Nurul Amin visit wounded students in hospital and that the assembly be adjourned as a sign of mourning. This motion was supported by some treasury bench members including Maulana Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish, Shorfuddin Ahmed, Shamsuddin Ahmed Khondokar and Mosihuddin Ahmed. However, Nurul Amin refused the requests.|$|E
5|$|From September 1939 to March 1940, Madgwick {{designed}} and managed an adult education scheme for the Sydney University Regiment, based at Menangle. As Australia in 1940 became increasingly involved in World War II and expanded its military forces, Madgwick and colleagues David Drummond, C.E.W. Bean, (Sir) Robert W. Wallace (<b>Vice-Chancellor</b> of the University of Sydney), Richard Charles Mills, W.G.K. Duncan, Alf A.J. Conlon, and others began to publicly {{call for the}} Australian Army to install an adult education program to combat illiteracy among its members and educate them in the political history of Australia. Beginning in May 1940 and culminating in a special conference on 20 August 1940, Madgwick and the others cooperatively drafted an adult education scheme for the Army.|$|E
