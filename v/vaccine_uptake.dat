25|$|For sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs), {{high levels of}} immunity in one sex induces herd immunity for both sexes.

Villages where the supply of the vaccine had been supported by the Southern African Newcastle Disease Control Project (SANDCP) five years earlier were compared to villages where the project had not been active. Our results indicate that a supportive vaccine delivery system can encourage Newcastle disease vaccine use and reduce chicken mortality; farmers who had used the vaccine had an average flock size that was 5. 5 chickens larger than farmers who had never used the vaccine. Even so, Newcastle disease <b>vaccine</b> demand and <b>uptake</b> would be improved in the study area by increasing the perceived effectiveness, addressing supply chain issues that limited availability, and following a vaccination calendar.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn 2013, Prince Edward Island was {{the first}} {{province}} to introduce HPV vaccine universally to grade six boys in a school-based program. Because uptake rates in boys are unknown {{in this type of}} vaccination program, uptake of HPV vaccination in boys was measured and compared with uptake rates in girls and then analyzed with factors such as county, urban–rural location of the school, and school board to identify where the vaccine program could be improved. MethodsHPV vaccination records from the provincial childhood immunization registry in PEI were merged with Department of Education data containing all grade six girls and boys in PEI. <b>Vaccine</b> <b>uptakes</b> between years and between sexes were compared using two sample tests of proportions. Logistic regression modeling which accounted for the hierarchical nature of the data was used to analyze associations between factors and uptake rates. ResultsAlthough uptake was high in boys and girls, a significantly greater proportion of girls (85 %) received all three doses of the HPV vaccine compared to boys (79 %; p= 0. 004). The odds of grade six girls being fully vaccinated for HPV were 1. 5 times greater than of grade six boys, and the odds of students in the English Language School Board receiving all three doses were more than twice as great as the odds of French Language School Board students. ConclusionsHPV vaccination for boys in PEI has had a successful launch, almost reaching the Canadian Immunization Committee recommendations of > 80 % for the early years of a program. PEI has a highly organized Public Health Nursing program that is involved in all childhood and school-based vaccinations in PEI and in this context very high coverage rates were obtained.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In this study, we {{assess how}} {{effective}} pandemic and trivalent 2009 - 2010 seasonal vaccines were in preventing influenza-like illness (ILI) during the 2009 A(H 1 N 1) pandemic in France. We also compare vaccine effectiveness against ILI versus laboratory-confirmed pandemic A(H 1 N 1) influenza, {{and assess the}} possible bias caused by using non-specific endpoints and observational data. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We estimated vaccine effectiveness by using the following formula: VE  =  (PPV-PCV) /(PPV(1 -PCV)) × 100 %, where PPV is the proportion vaccinated in the population and PCV the proportion of vaccinated influenza cases. People were considered vaccinated three weeks after receiving a dose of vaccine. ILI and pandemic A(H 1 N 1) laboratory-confirmed cases were obtained from two surveillance networks of general practitioners. During the epidemic, 99. 7 % of influenza isolates were pandemic A(H 1 N 1). Pandemic and seasonal <b>vaccine</b> <b>uptakes</b> in the population {{were obtained from the}} National Health Insurance database and by telephonic surveys, respectively. Effectiveness estimates were adjusted by age and week. The presence of residual biases was explored by calculating vaccine effectiveness after the influenza period. The effectiveness of pandemic vaccines in preventing ILI was 52 % (95 % confidence interval: 30 - 69) during the pandemic and 33 % (4 - 55) after. It was 86 % (56 - 98) against confirmed influenza. The effectiveness of seasonal vaccines against ILI was 61 % (56 - 66) during the pandemic and 19 % (- 10 - 41) after. It was 60 % (41 - 74) against confirmed influenza. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of pandemic vaccines in preventing confirmed pandemic A(H 1 N 1) influenza on the field was high, consistently with published findings. It was significantly lower against ILI. This is unsurprising since not all ILI cases are caused by influenza. Trivalent 2009 - 2010 seasonal vaccines had a statistically significant effectiveness in preventing ILI and confirmed pandemic influenza, but were not better in preventing confirmed pandemic influenza than in preventing ILI. This lack of difference might be indicative of selection bias...|$|R

We present the first ever method to remove this assumption from vaccination uptake estimation: our method dynamically adapts to temporal fluctuations in time series web data used to estimate vaccination uptake. We show our method to outperform the state of the art compared to competitive baselines that use not only web data but also curated clinical data. This performance improvement is more pronounced for <b>vaccines</b> whose <b>uptake</b> has been irregular due to negative media attention (HPV- 1 and HPV- 2), problems in vaccine supply (DiTeKiPol), and targeted at children of 12 years old (whose vaccination is more irregular compared to younger children) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 This {{dissertation}} describes {{two different}} projects. The {{first is the}} development of an oral DNA vaccine delivery system for fish. A novel oral DNA vaccine delivery system was developed for Rainbow Trout by combining non-viral vectors (polycationic liposomes or polycationic polymer) to facilitate the DNA <b>vaccine's</b> <b>uptake</b> by cell membranes along with enteric-coated protection of the DNA embedded in microparticles to prevent DNA degradation in the gastrointestinal tract. Spray drying and spray coating bead techniques were employed in the preparation of the DNA vaccine microparticles. The spray drying technique allowed production of spherical shape enteric-coated microparticles with a particle size range of 0. 18 to 20 μm. Larger particle sizes of 40 - 50 mesh were obtained from the spray-coated bead technique. The resultant DNA vaccine microparticles were granulated with regular fish feed and given to fish to investigate the efficacy of the delivery system in providing protection against IHNV, and to demonstrate the ease of administration in fish. An in vivo fish trial experiment showed improvement in fish survival rate when fish were immunized with larger particle size DNA vaccine microparticles. Further research to find effective vector carriers for the DNA vaccine delivery system and to seek modifications of the delivery system that will still prevent the denaturation of plasmid DNA that will also facilitate membrane uptake of the DNA vaccine is needed in order to develop a safe, effective, and commercially viable vaccine to control the outbreak of IHNV. The second project of the dissertation is prediction of in vitro drug release profiles from a novel matrix tablet spray-coated with a barrier membrane using mathematical and statistical models. Tablets were prepared by direct compression followed by spray coating. The relationship of the amount of hydrophilic materials in the core tablets and barrier thickness on drug release mechanism was investigated using factorial design and regression analysis. Drug release characteristics were influenced and can be controlled by modifying the amount of hydrophilic materials in the core tablet and the barrier thickness. Mathematical equation generated from regression analysis of n-value, lag time, and percent drug release {{as a function of the}} amount of hydrophilic material and the amount of coating material applied can now be used as a tool for predicting and optimizing in vitro drug release from matrix tablets spray-coated with a barrier membrane...|$|R
40|$|Background: Controversy {{over the}} measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) <b>vaccine</b> has reduced <b>uptake,</b> raising {{concerns}} {{of a future}} disease epidemic. Aims: To explore parents' accounts of decision making relating to the MMR <b>vaccine</b> controversy, identifying <b>uptake</b> determinants and education needs. Design of study: Qualitative interviews analysed using the ‘framework’ approach. Setting: Five general practices in the Leeds area, 2002 – 2003. Method: Sixty-nine interviews conducted with parents of children aged between 4 and 5 years, and 12 interviews with primary care practitioners, managers and immunisation coordinators serving participating sites. Participants were interviewed one-to-one {{in a place of}} their choice. Results: The vaccination decision is primarily a function of parental assessments of the relative acceptability and likelihood of possible outcomes. For most parents the evidence of science and medicine plays little role in the decision. Although local general practitioners and health visitors are trusted information sources, the influence of primary care providers on the vaccination decision is limited by concerns over consultation legitimacy, discussion opportunity, and perceptions of financial and political partiality. Parents and practitioners identify a need for new approaches to support decisions and learning when faced with this and similar healthcare controversies. These include new collaborative approaches to information exchange designed to transform rather than supplant existing parent knowledge as part of an ongoing learning process. Conclusion: The study identified new ways in which parents and practitioners need to be supported in order to increase understanding of medical science and secure more informed decisions in the face of health controversy...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveInformation {{exchange}} via Twitter {{and other}} forms of social media make public health communication more complex as citizens play an increasingly influential role in shaping acceptable or desired health behaviours. Taking the case of the 2009 - 10 H 1 N 1 pandemic, we explore in detail the dissemination of H 1 N 1 -related advice in the UK through Twitter to see how it was used to discourage or encourage <b>vaccine</b> and antiviral <b>uptake.</b> MethodsIn three stages we conducted (1) an analysis of general content, retweeting patterns and URL sharing, (2) a discourse analysis of the public evaluation of press releases and (3) a template analysis of conversations around <b>vaccine</b> and antiviral <b>uptake,</b> using Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) as a way of understanding how the public weighed the costs and benefits. ResultsNetwork analysis of retweets showed that information from official sources predominated. Analysing the spread of significant messages through Twitter showed that most content was descriptive but there was some criticism of health authorities. A detailed analysis of responses to press releases revealed some scepticism over the economic beneficiaries of vaccination, that served to undermine public trust. Finally, the conversational analysis showed the influence of peers when weighing up the risks and benefits of medication. ConclusionsMost tweets linked to reliable sources, however Twitter was used to discuss both individual and health authority motivations to vaccinate.

40|$|The {{pathogenic}} {{nature of}} cancer is attributed, {{at least in}} part, {{to the ability of}} tumors cells to induce systemic and local mechanisms of immune tolerance. However, we previously reported that tumor-free survival in up to 100 % of tolerized HER- 2 /neu transgenic mice can be achieved by administration of neu-specific mAb concurrently with a HER- 2 /neu–expressing, GM-CSF–secreting whole cell vaccine. In this report, we show that one mechanism of improved antitumor activity induced by the combination of these 2 neu-targeted interventions was enhanced Fc-mediated activation of APCs. Specifically, in vivo studies demonstrated localization of radiolabeled neu-specific mAb at the vaccine site. Subsequently, increased accumulation of neu-specific mAb at the vaccine-draining lymph node correlated with increased <b>vaccine</b> cell <b>uptake</b> by DCs in vivo. This led to enhancement of CD 8 + neu-specific T cell function in terms of proliferation, cytokine production, and central memory development. Thus, the administration of a neu-specific mAb with a neu-targeted GM-CSF–secreting tumor vaccine enhanced induction of neu-specific CD 8 + T cells through Fc-mediated activation of DCs. This multimodality attack on the same tumor antigen may have the potential to overcome tolerance to self antigens and weaken the immunosuppressive networks within the tumor microenvironment...|$|R
40|$|Background: Inequalities in {{cervical}} {{cancer may be}} increased following mass vaccination against the human papillomavirus (HPV) if girls with low <b>vaccine</b> <b>uptake</b> also have low future participation in {{cervical cancer}} screening. We evaluated how <b>vaccine</b> <b>uptake</b> distribution affects inequalities in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) incidence between groups with different screen-ing participation. Methods:We used an individual-based transmission dynam-ic model of HPV infection and disease (HPV-ADVISE). Females were stratified by routine screening frequency. We modeled the impact of vaccination on SCC incidence rate differences (absolute inequality) and incidence rate ratios (relative inequality) between women who have routine screen-ing intervals of < 5 years (frequently screened), 5 years (underscreened), and who are never screened. We compared simulations with uniform <b>vaccine</b> <b>uptake</b> with scenarios with unequal <b>vaccine</b> <b>uptake,</b> in which never and underscreened women have lower <b>vaccine</b> <b>uptake</b> than frequently screened women. Results: Absolute SCC inequalities between groups with dif-ferent screening rates were predicted to decrease after vaccination, evenwhenwomenwith the lowest screeningparticipationhad the lowest <b>vaccine</b> <b>uptake.</b> Herd effects helped reduce absolute inequalities when <b>vaccine</b> <b>uptake</b> was unequal. Conversely, rel-ative SCC inequalities remained unchanged or increased after vaccination. Results were robust to different overall vaccination coverages and sexual mixing scenarios. Conclusion: Though mass HPV vaccination is predicted to substantially decrease SCC incidence rates, never screenedwomen will still have the highest disease burden after vaccination. Impact: To reduce both absolute and relative SCC inequalities, public health initiatives will need to address inequalities in both <b>vaccine</b> <b>uptake</b> and in cervical cancer screening participation.

This study examined the influence of local community views of cholera on oral cholera <b>vaccine</b> (OCV) <b>uptake</b> in a mass vaccination campaign in 2009 in peri-urban and rural areas of Zanzibar. It used data from interviews conducted before the campaign and followed previous research assessing determinants of anticipated OCV acceptance. OCV uptake was lower than the reported anticipated acceptance. Less than half of the 356 adult respondents (49. 7 %) drank the required two doses of OCV. Variables referring to socio-cultural features of diarrheal illness that respondents identified with a cholera case vignette explained uptake better than analysis only of socio-demographic characteristics. Somatic features of illness not specific for cholera were negative determinants. Recognition of unconsciousness as a serious sign of dehydration and concern that cholera outbreaks would overwhelm the local healthcare system in the rural area were positive determinants of acceptance. Female gender, rural residence and older age were also positive determinants of OCV <b>uptake.</b> For further <b>vaccine</b> action with OCVs, cholera as a cause of severe dehydration should be distinguished from other causes of diarrhea.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{vaccinology}} provides excellent promises to control different infectious and non-infectious diseases. Genetic immunization {{as a new}} tool in this area by using naked DNA {{has been shown to}} induce humoral as well as cellular immune responses with high efficiency. This demonstrates the enormous potential of this strategy for vaccination purposes. DNA vaccines have been widely used to develop vaccines against various pathogens as well as cancer, autoimmune diseases and allergy. However, despite their successful application in many pre-clinical disease models, their potency in human clinical trials has been insufficient to provide protective immunity. Several strategies have been applied to increase the potency of DNA vaccine. Among these strategies, the linkage of antigens to Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) and the utilization of different delivery systems have been demonstrated as efficient approaches for increasing the potency of DNA <b>vaccines.</b> The <b>uptake</b> of DNA plasmids by cells upon injection is inefficient. Two basic delivery approaches including physical delivery to achieve higher levels of antigen production and formulation with microparticles to target Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) are effective in animal models.

We used multilevel multivariate polytomous logistic regressions to test the correlates of IFVC. Between 2008 and 2011 the annual IFVC rate varied from 33. 7 % to 32. 3 % in the 18 – 64 age group and from 69. 5 % to 61. 1 % in the 65  + age group, among whom we saw a clear trend towards reduced vaccination after 2008. In the younger group, the probability of regular vaccination each year from 2008 to 2011 increased with diabetes severity and duration, comorbidities, {{and the number of}} general practitioner and nurse visits; it was higher among patients seeing endocrinologists and lower among low-income patients than in other patients. In the older group, there was no association with either diabetes severity or physician specialty. These results suggest different patterns of correlates of influenza vaccination according to age. Endocrinologists might help to improve IFV uptake in the younger group of patients with type 2 diabetes. Communication strategies regarding influenza vaccination should be adapted to age, and collaboration between healthcare professionals should be reinforced to achieve vaccination objectives for these patients...|$|R
