40|$|Significant {{advances}} in SIS receiver technology {{since the last}} Asilomar meeting include: superconductor materials, integrated inductive tuning elements, and planar mounting structures. The effect of these advances is to push the upper <b>frequency</b> <b>operating</b> limit from about 600 to 1500 GHz, and to enhance the feasibility of focal plane arrays of heterodyne receivers. A fundamental <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>operating</b> limit of SIS mixers is set by the superconducting energy gap.

The performance of the mixer will be degraded by the Resistor-Capacitor rolloff. Several designs were reported for inductive elements integrated on the same substrate as the SIS junctions to tune out the bulk junction capacitance.

40|$|A {{multi-level}} inverter configuration for 4 n pole {{induction motor}} drive {{is presented in}} this paper. This topology is developed using three two-level inverters and two isolated dc sources. Among these three two-level inverters one inverter is switched at fundamental frequency and remaining two inverters are switched at <b>higher</b> <b>frequency.</b> Two isolated dc sources with equal magnitude are used in this topology to block the path for zero sequence currents. Low <b>frequency</b> <b>operated</b> inverter is connected to one dc source and <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>operated</b> inverters are connected to other dc source. The magnitude of dc source voltage required in this topology is four times lesser than the dc source required in conventional five-level NPC inverter configuration.

This topology can be operated during the failure of any one inverter switches or any one dc source which will increase {{the reliability of the}} system.

40|$|Abstract — Miniaturization in length, {{lowering}} of power, increase in package density {{and sensitivity to}} light of MOSFET leads it as the potential candidate for RF application. As device is expected to operate at RF, {{it is essential to}} observe its frequency dependent characteristics at RF. In this paper frequency dependent electro optical characteristics of Optically Gated Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (OGMOSFET) are investigated numerically. Variation of drain current-voltage characteristics, gate capacitance and transconductance of OGMOSFET, with varying frequency, is reported. MOSFET having length of 0. 35 µm is selected for investigation, which is optically gated with incident radiations of optical power of 0. 25 mW and wavelength of 800 nm. MATLAB is used as computational platform to test and tune the results. Results show that increase in modulating frequency of OGMOSFET decreases drain current, gate capacitance, transconductance and output conductance. This is due to decrease in life time of inversion charges at very <b>high</b> <b>frequencies.</b> <b>Operating</b> bandwidth of the device is up to 4 GHz.

40|$|Background The {{prevalence}} of thrombocytopenia in neonates ranges from 22 to 35 %, {{and one of}} the most feared complica­tions is intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Previous research in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (CMH), Jakarta reported a high incidence of IVH (43. 47 %) in infants with a gestational age of 2). Thrombocyte counts were recorded on the same day as the diagnosis of IVH. Results The risk of severe IVH was 28. 2 % in neonates with thrombocyte counts < 100, 000 /uL, and 10. 4 % in neonates without thrombocytopenia (P= 0. 014). Multivariate analysis revealed that gestational age < 32 weeks and the use of respira­tory support (<b>ventilator</b> and <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> oscillatory ventila­tion) had significant associations with severe IVH. However, multivariate analysis did not show a significant relationship between thrombocytopenia and severe IVH (correlation coef­ficient = 0. 21).

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{particular}} miniature two-phase loop named Periodic Two-Phase Thermosyphon (PTPT), whose operation is periodic. A Periodic two-phase thermosyphon allows remote condensation and broad flexibility in the mutual displacement of the evaporator {{with respect to the}} condenser. In addition, a PTPT allows the overall dimensions of the evaporator to be drastically reduced, and allows it to be placed close to the electronic equipment; it is suitable for high density packaging thermal control applications. In this paper the authors have experimentally compared the performance of two mini-PTPT prototypes which <b>operate</b> at <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> (0. 016 Hz) with those obtained by 4 high performance commercial devices which are designed to be implemented on the surface of a Pentium© IV processor.

These devices show that their performance is not influenced by the tilt angle of the heating surface. The dynamic response of these devices is influenced by the operational frequency. In the case of compact <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>operating</b> PTPT, the dynamic response is quicker than with other capillary loops such as LHP and CPL, and similar to that of heat pipe cooling devices, which do not allow remote condensation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an equivalent circuit model for common-emitter current-gain collapse in multi-finger HBTs. The collapse of current-gain is an undesirable phenomenon, which occurs in multi-finger HBTs {{when they are}} operated at high power density. The collapse manifests itself by a distinct abrupt decrease of collector current in the output characteristics of the HBT. Until now, there hasn’t been an equivalent circuit model to simulate the current collapse behavior of multi-finger HBTs. In this paper, for the first time, the large-signal Ebers-Moll model is modified to include the effect of current-gain collapse. Hence, the model presented here is a big step towards predicting the behavior of multi-finger HBTs under high power and <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>operating</b> con-ditions. Also, the self-heating effect which {{gives rise to the}} negative output resistance is included in the equivalent circuit without the use of an external thermal feedback circuit. Hence, the equivalent circuit is much simpler to implement and easier to analyze. Moreover, it includes the phenomenon of current-gain collapse. The model is applied to an InGaAs/GaAs multi-finger heterojunction bipo-lar transistor (HBT) and the simulated and the measured characteristics are compared in order to validate the model. Both the small signal and large signal models are implemented as user-define...|$|R
40|$|Microwave {{frequency}} domain multiplexing is a suitable technique to read {{out a large}} number of detector channels using only a few connecting lines. In the HOLMES experiment this is based on inductively coupled rf-SQUIDs (Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices) fed by TES (Transition Edge Sensors). Biasing of the whole rf-SQUID chain is provided with a single transmission line by means of the recently introduced flux-ramp modulation technique, a sawtooth signal which allows signal reconstruction while operating the rf-SQUIDs in open loop condition. Due to the crucial role of the sawtooth signal, {{it is very important that}} it does not suffer from ground loop disturbances and EMI. Introducing a transformer between the biasing source and the SQUIDs is very effective in suppressing disturbances. The sawtooth signal has slow and fast components, and the period can vary between a few kHz up to MHz depending on the TES signal and SQUID characteristics. A transformer able to face such a broad range of conditions must have very stringent characteristics and needs to be custom designed. Our solution exploits standard commercial, and inexpensive, transformers for LAN networks used in a suitable combination.
