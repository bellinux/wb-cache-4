500|$|Henderson, who {{had fallen}} behind the net, {{got up and went}} to the front of the net where he was uncovered. Henderson {{recovered}} the rebound of Esposito's shot, shot the puck and was stopped, but recovered the rebound. With Tretiak down, he put the puck past Tretiak with only 34 seconds to play. Foster Hewitt's <b>voice</b> <b>rose</b> in excitement as he called the winning goal: ...|$|E
2500|$|Going to {{the small}} {{telephone}} box with its slender wire attachments, Mr. Bell coolly asked, as though addressing someone in an adjoining room, [...] "Mr. Watson, are you ready!" [...] Mr. Watson, five miles away in Somerville, promptly answered in the affirmative, and soon was heard a voice singing [...] "America". [...] Going to another instrument, connected by wire with Providence, forty-three miles distant, Mr. Bell listened a moment, and said, [...] "Signor Brignolli, who is assisting at a concert in Providence Music Hall, will now sing for us." [...] In a moment the cadence of the tenor's <b>voice</b> <b>rose</b> and fell, the sound being faint, sometimes lost, and then again audible. Later, a cornet solo played in Somerville was very distinctly heard. Still later, a three-part song came over the wire from Somerville, and Mr. Bell told his audience [...] "I will switch off the song {{from one part of}} the room to another so that all can hear." [...] At a subsequent lecture in Salem, Massachusetts, communication was established with Boston, eighteen miles distant, and Mr. Watson at the latter place sang [...] "Auld Lang Syne", the National Anthem, and [...] "Hail Columbia", while the audience at Salem joined in the chorus.|$|E
60|$|Alas the <b>voice</b> <b>rose,</b> sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.|$|E
60|$|Long and eagerly they spoke, {{and their}} soft <b>voices</b> <b>rose</b> high.|$|R
6000|$|And mortal hate their {{thousand}} <b>voices</b> <b>rose,</b> They passed like aimless arrows {{from his}} ear-- Nor did his heart or mind its portal close ...|$|R
6000|$|The <b>voices</b> <b>rose</b> again more rapidly. [...] "Fifty more. Another to me. Oh, what's {{the use of}} fooling. One hundred better. Twenty {{again to}} me." ...|$|R
60|$|There was silence; then Mrs. Ercott's <b>voice</b> <b>rose</b> again, impersonal, far away.|$|E
60|$|Then Karlsefin's <b>voice</b> <b>rose</b> {{loud and}} clear as he issued his final commands.|$|E
60|$|The poor girl's <b>voice</b> <b>rose</b> as {{she spoke}} until {{it was almost a}} shriek.|$|E
60|$|The {{drumming}} sound sank, {{and rose}} {{again in a}} confused roar as the horsemen crossed a wooden bridge while Alice Deringham stood up, when once more the <b>voices</b> <b>rose</b> stridently.|$|R
6000|$|... "Port! port! hard-a-port!" [...] {{shouted the}} men. Their hoarse <b>voices</b> <b>rose</b> above the gale, but not above the terrible {{roar of the}} surf, which now mingled with {{the din of the}} storm.|$|R

60|$|His <b>voice</b> <b>rose</b> into {{a fierce}} yell, as he strove in vain with the table.|$|E
60|$|Grace laughed, {{a rather}} {{strained}} laugh, as Osborn's angry <b>voice</b> <b>rose</b> {{from behind a}} shrubbery.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{clamorous}} shout, {{and as the}} men trooped away, Jake's <b>voice</b> <b>rose</b> up.|$|E
6000|$|As {{he spoke}} {{somebody}} beat upon a suspended iron sheet {{down in the}} valley and drowsy <b>voices</b> <b>rose</b> up from among the clustered tents. Summers went by shouting, [...] "Get a move on, before we lose the bridge!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Hetty made no answer, {{and there}} was silence for a space while the light grew dimmer, until the sound of <b>voices</b> <b>rose</b> from without, and she felt her heart beat a trifle faster than usual, when {{somebody}} said, [...] "Captain Cheyne!" ...|$|R
60|$|We had walked, as we talked, and now {{we passed}} through the little gate into the garden. <b>Voices</b> <b>rose</b> near at hand, for tea was spread out under the sycamore-tree, {{as it had been}} on the day of my arrival.|$|R
60|$|His face flushed, and his <b>voice</b> <b>rose</b> as he dwelt {{upon the}} things he had undergone.|$|E
60|$|His <b>voice</b> <b>rose</b> {{abruptly}} {{as he put}} the question, and his unoccupied hand fastened on {{my other}} arm.|$|E
60|$|His <b>voice</b> <b>rose</b> at {{the last}} words, and his eyes brightened with indignation {{as he looked at}} Geoffrey.|$|E
60|$|Their thin, shrill <b>voices</b> <b>rose</b> {{high above}} {{the roar of the}} flames and the crash of the masonry, like the yelping of a pack of wolves who see their quarry before them and know that they have well-nigh run him down.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do, auntie, it's {{perfectly}} splendid," [...] cried <b>Rose's</b> <b>voice,</b> and <b>Rose's</b> blooming {{face was}} seen behind the ribs of the skeleton, smiling and nodding in the gayest possible manner.|$|R
6000|$|The gaping crowd, hanging {{its large}} {{collective}} ear toward the two aviators, was shouting: [...] "Hoorray! He's all right!"--As their <b>voices</b> <b>rose</b> Carl {{became aware that}} {{all over the city}} hundreds of factory-whistles and bells were howling their welcome to him--the victor.|$|R
60|$|A motor-car dashing past drowned the rest, {{and when}} the <b>voice</b> <b>rose</b> again it was evidently dictating another paragraph.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy, {{knowing what}} the hazard was, pressed his telegraph, and held his breath until a harsh <b>voice</b> <b>rose</b> again.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{breaking}} that trance, Mr. Stone's <b>voice</b> <b>rose</b> again, trembling {{out into}} the night, as though blown through a reed.|$|E
60|$|The three <b>voices</b> <b>rose</b> in a {{prolonged}} shout, in which, however, the distinguishing {{quality of the}} pleasant voice was sustained. But {{there was no response}} from the darkness beyond. The shouting was repeated after an interval with the same result: the silence and obscurity remained unchanged.|$|R
60|$|It {{was getting}} dark when Cliffe wakened. The windows were open, and a {{flickering}} red glow shone into the room. Footsteps and <b>voices</b> <b>rose</b> {{from the street}} below, as if the city were astir, but this did not interest him much. Evelyn was standing near, and a man whom {{he could not see}} well sat in the shadow.|$|R
60|$|The crowd, nonplussed, now {{began to}} argue and shout and whistle. The <b>voices</b> <b>rose</b> in pitch and derision. Steam was getting up. There hung the flag. The {{procession}} crowded forward {{and filled the}} street in a mass below. All {{the rest of the}} street was empty and shut up. And still hung the showy rag, red and white and green, up aloft.|$|R
60|$|A great sea-bird, {{disturbed}} by her <b>voice,</b> <b>rose</b> from the ditch below with a flapping of wings and drifted away seaward.|$|E
60|$|And then Slone drew dose to {{the excited}} group. Brackton held the center; he was gesticulating; his thin <b>voice</b> <b>rose</b> piercingly.|$|E
60|$|Even Julian's {{patience}} {{began to}} show signs of yielding. His manner assumed a sudden decision, his <b>voice</b> <b>rose</b> a tone louder.|$|E
60|$|Just as {{an officer}} came aft, Bub crept forward, and hid away {{in one of the}} boats. Not an instant too soon. The alarm was given. Loud <b>voices</b> <b>rose</b> in command. The cruiser altered her course. An {{electric}} search-light began to throw its white rays across the sea, here, there, everywhere; but in its flashing path no tossing schooner was revealed.|$|R

60|$|There {{was evidently}} very little {{going on in}} the town that afternoon. Here and there a man leaned heavy-eyed, as if unaccustomed to the brightness, on the {{balustrade}} in front of a store, and raucous <b>voices</b> <b>rose</b> from one or two second-rate saloons, but there were few other signs of life, and Nasmyth was not sorry when they reached the wooden hotel. Acton stopped a moment in front of the building.|$|R
