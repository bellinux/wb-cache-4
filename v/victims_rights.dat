The Washington Post writer Harriet Winslow called Williams' performance poignant and riveting, {{and called the}} fact that it did not overshadow the other actors a [...] "tribute to the quality of this cast". John J. O'Connor of The New York Times called the episode [...] "extraordinary" [...] and said [...] "The senselessness of the incident is heartbreakingly captured". St. Louis Post-Dispatch writer Gail Pennington praised Williams' [...] "controlled performance" [...] as well as several [...] "terrific scenes". Among them, she said, were Gee's explanation of how police use humor as a buffer from the horrors of their jobs, and the scene where detectives simultaneously interrogate two suspects in different rooms, which she said was [...] "choreographed as tightly as the Bolshoi Ballet".|$|E

40|$|Scholars {{are divided}} over whether a <b>victim's</b> <b>rights</b> persist when an agent permissibly {{responds}} to an emergency. According {{to the prevailing}} view the moral force of rights is not extinguished by moral permissibility and the agent, therefore, {{has a duty to}} compensate the victim. According to another influential view permissibility does erase the moral force of rights and the agent, therefore, can only have a duty to compensate for reasons {{other than the fact that}} they committed a rights transgression. I argue that liability does not follow even if we grant that the <b>victim's</b> <b>rights</b> persevere. A non-pecuniary remedy such as a formal apology provides an adequate way of vindicating the <b>victim's</b> <b>rights</b> and of recognizing the agent's causal role. Thus, the answer to the question of what remedy the permissible transgressor owes the victim does not provide us with an answer to the question of who should bear the burden. © Springer 2009...|$|R
