25|$|The 2016 {{elections}} {{took place}} on November 8. Obama was term-limited in 2016 due to the 22nd Amendment, though Obama's approval ratings may have impacted his party's ability to win the race. In June 2016, with the Democratic primaries nearly complete, Obama endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as his successor. However, according to Glenn Thrush of Politico, Obama had long supported Clinton as his preferred successor, and Obama dissuaded <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>Biden</b> from running against Clinton. Obama spoke in favor of Clinton at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, and he continued to campaign for Clinton and other Democrats {{in the months leading}} up to Election Day. However, in the general election, Clinton was defeated by Republican nominee Donald Trump, who prominently questioned Obama's place of birth during Obama's first term. Republicans also retained control of the House and Senate. During the eight years of Obama's presidency, the Democratic Party experienced a net loss of 1,041 governorships and state and federal legislative seats. Ronald Brownstein of The Atlantic noted that these losses were similar to those of other post-World War II two-term presidents.|$|E

Gates advocated using the drone missile option, but changed his support {{the next day to}} the helicopter raid plan. Obama said he wanted to speak directly to Admiral McRaven before he gave the order to proceed. The president asked if McRaven had learned anything since arriving in Afghanistan that caused him to lose confidence in the mission. McRaven told him the team was ready and that the next few nights would have little moonlight over Abbottabad, good conditions for a raid.|$|E

On Saturday, August 29, a procession traveled from the library to the Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica in Boston, for a funeral Mass. Present at the funeral service were President Obama and former presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush (also representing his father, former President George H. W. Bush, who decided not to attend), along with <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>Biden,</b> three former Vice presidents, 58 senators, 21 former senators, many members of the House of Representatives, and several foreign dignitaries. President Obama delivered the eulogy.|$|E
500|$|Amid {{the massive}} crowds that {{arrived at the}} U.S. Capitol for the inauguration, about 4,000 ticket holders were unable to gain entry to {{reserved}} areas on the Capitol grounds after security personnel closed the gates {{at the start of}} the formal ceremony. Many ticket holders were stuck in underground tunnels where pedestrian traffic was directed to and from the National Mall. People dubbed one such tunnel [...] "the Purple Tunnel of Doom", after the purple tickets that would-be viewers held. Others remained stuck in long lines as they waited to gain entry to the reserved areas. Senator Dianne Feinstein, in her capacity as chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, launched an investigation to address complaints by the affected ticket holders. The committee later announced that ticket holders who were unable to enter the Capitol grounds to view the ceremony would receive a copy of the swearing-in invitation and program, photos of President Obama and <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>Biden</b> and a color print of the inaugural ceremony.|$|E
500|$|President Obama {{said that}} Kennedy's death marked the [...] "passing of an {{extraordinary}} leader" [...] and that he and First Lady Michelle Obama were [...] "heartbroken" [...] to learn of his passing, while <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>Biden</b> said [...] "today we lost a truly remarkable man," [...] and that Kennedy [...] "changed the circumstances of {{tens of millions of}} Americans". Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts Governor and Kennedy's opponent in the 1994 senate race, called Kennedy [...] "the kind of man you could like even if he was your adversary" [...] and former First Lady Nancy Reagan said she was [...] "terribly saddened". [...] She went on, [...] "Given our political differences, people are sometimes surprised how close Ronnie and I have been to the Kennedy family.... I will miss him." [...] Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the President pro tempore of the Senate, issued a statement on Kennedy's death in which he said [...] "My heart and soul weeps at the loss of my best friend in the Senate, my beloved friend, Ted Kennedy." [...] (Byrd had broken down on the Senate floor and cried uncontrollably when Kennedy's cancer diagnosis was made public the previous year.) Upon his death, his sister Jean is the only one still living of the nine Kennedy siblings.|$|E

500|$|After his {{selection}} {{as a vice}} presidential candidate, Biden was criticized by his own Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington Bishop Michael Saltarelli over his stance on abortion, which goes against the church's pro-life beliefs and teachings. [...] The diocese confirmed that even if elected <b>vice</b> <b>president,</b> <b>Biden</b> {{would not be allowed}} to speak at Catholic schools. [...] Biden was soon barred from receiving Holy Communion by the bishop of his original hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, because of his support for abortion rights; however, Biden did continue to receive Communion at his local Delaware parish. [...] Scranton became a flash point in the competition for swing state Catholic voters between the Democratic campaign and liberal Catholic groups, who stressed that other social issues should be considered as much or more than abortion, and many bishops and conservative Catholics, who maintained abortion was paramount. Biden said he believed that life began at conception but that he would not impose his personal religious views on others. Bishop Saltarelli had previously stated regarding stances similar to Biden's: [...] "No one today would accept this statement from any public servant: 'I am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena.' Likewise, none of us should accept this statement from any public servant: 'I am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena.'" ...|$|E

Discussed topics on the plenary session were integration of south-east Europe into Euro-Atlantic processes, migrant crisis, security challenges and the fight against terrorism, conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, as well as energy. <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>Biden</b> stated: [...] "For the United States and for me personally, but I am {{speaking on behalf of}} the President Obama, this region has been of extreme interest for the last 25 years." [...] In addition, Biden praised Brdo-Brijuni initiative as [...] "a good job as it has managed to bring together heads of state for talks for the past five years". <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>Biden</b> also met with the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanović and Foreign Minister Vesna Pusić with whom he talked about situation in the Middle East, especially about the war in Syria, migrant crisis and the security situation in the world after 2015 Paris terrorist attacks.|$|E
