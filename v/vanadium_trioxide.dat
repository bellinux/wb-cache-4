The existing state and electrochemical behavior of NaVO 3 were also studied. The results indicated that V 2 O 3 {{can be obtained from}} NaVO 3. VC and C were also formed at high cell voltage, high temperature, and long electrolysis time. During electrolysis, NaVO 3 was dissociated to Na+ and VO 3 - in NaCl molten salt. NaVO 3 was initially electro-reduced to V 2 O 3 on cathode and Na 2 O was released simultaneously. Na 2 CO 3 was formed due to the reaction between Na 2 O and CO 2. The production of C was ascribed to the electro-reduction of CO 32 -. VC was produced due to the reaction between C and V 2 O 3...|$|E

Specifically, a novel method for {{the preparation of}} V(2) O(5) nanorods is discussed. It involves ball milling {{as a first step}} and controlled annealing as a second step. Nanorods of V(2) O(5) can be converted into those of other vanadium-related phases by simple chemical reduction treatments. Such chemical transformations are pseudomorphic and often topotactic, that is, the resulting nanorods belong to a different chemical phase but tend to retain the original morphology and preferential crystal orientation dictated by parent V(2) O(5) crystals. The corresponding properties of nanorods for their prospective application in electrochemical energy storage (lithium-ion batteries and electrochemical supercapacitors) are discussed. The synthesised V(2) O(5) nanorods possess a stable cyclic behaviour when they are used in a cathode of a lithium-ion battery and are suitable for use in an anode. VN nanorods synthesised by NH(3) reduction of V(2) O(5) were found to possess pseudocapacitive properties in aqueous electrolytes. <br /...|$|E

This pattern of response (24 -hr SHE negative/ 7 -day SHE positive) has been seen with other chemicals which have tumor promotion-like character-istics.

40|$|Syrian {{fuel oil}} is most common of its {{contents}} of sulphur and vanadium,i. e 4. 5 % and 120 ppmrespectively and during its combustion, sulphur will be converted to sulphur dioxide SO 2. in someof the boiler parts such as superheater, reheater and air heaters, some of the sulphur dioxide willbe catalyzed by <b>Vanadium</b> to sulphur <b>trioxide</b> SO 3. In both cases this causes severe corrosion anddeposits in addition to air pollution. To meet stringent emission standards stipulated by regulatoryagencies, fuel oil is required to bring down its content of sulphur or it must be treated during itscombustion. the present work aims to highlight the side effects caused by fuel oil combustion inaddition to investigate the influence of special types of chemical additives {{in order to reduce}} theseeffects. solids contents (ash, soot, cenosphere) as well as gas emissions produced from ZaraThermal Power Station (ZTPS), which is operated using fuel oil or sometime nature gas,have beendetermined. The station consists of three units with maximum capacity of 660 MW. The resulltsshow that the station produces about 15 ton SO 2 /hr and about 4 ton solids/day in addition tocorrosion problems at several parts of the boiler and chimney. By utilizating continuouscombustion-unit and fuel oil as fuel to this unit, we could apply several chemical additives such asCu, Mn, Mn+Cr and Mn+Cu+Cr at different concentrations of 100, 175 and 250 ppm. There wereworth noting results of using these additives in reducing gas emissions (SOx, CO) ...|$|R
