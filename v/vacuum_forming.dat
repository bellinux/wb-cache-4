25|$|Amstrad {{was founded}} in 1968 by Alan Sugar {{at the age of}} 21, the name of the {{original}} company being AMS Trading (Amstrad) Limited, derived from its founder's initials (Alan Michael Sugar). Amstrad entered the market in the field of consumer electronics. During the 1970s they were at the forefront of low-priced hi-fi, TV and car stereo cassette technologies. Lower prices were achieved by injection moulding plastic hi-fi turntable covers, undercutting competitors who used the <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> process.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy is}} not {{generally}} such as to provide riches. Neither is it one which used to require large towns as other than external markets in which to sell. The population is therefore dispersed. The exception to this is the town of Oyonnax, in the Ange valley which is parallel with the Ain. According to the legend, St Léger gave the monopoly of comb making to Oyonnax in 630. The traditional small products of the region, wood-turning, horn combs and trinkets {{led to the development}} of a specialism in the injection moulding, <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> and so on of plastics, beginning with celluloid in 1880. The town's population in 1999 was 24,636 but it is the exception for the river basin (ext links).|$|E

50|$|Wood {{patterns}} {{are a common}} material to <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> but probably the most obvious. Wood is relatively inexpensive and allows the customer to make changes to the design easily. Using recycled objects or forms are the most sustainable {{way to make a}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> because they are 'found objects' at no additional cost. The number of samples that one is able to get from any pattern depends {{on the size of the}} part and the thickness of the material. Once the specifications of the part have been met, the pattern is then used to create a ceramic composite mold, or cast aluminum mold for regular production. Potentially, there are ways to create holes in plaster with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> if the replicated forms you make the <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> from are deep enough and you leave gaps between them for the plastic to form into. Then, once the plastic is used to cast a plaster mold, the deep plastic areas will leave holes if the mold is not completely filled.|$|R

2500|$|As a {{thermoplastic}} polymer, polystyrene is in a solid (glassy) {{state at}} room temperature but flows if heated above about 100°C, its glass transition temperature. [...] It becomes rigid again when cooled. [...] This temperature behaviour is exploited for extrusion (as in Styrofoam) and also for molding and <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming,</b> since it can be cast into molds with fine detail.|$|E
2500|$|Custom {{packaging}} is {{an evolutionary}} use of modern materials. Thermoforming and <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> allow for expanded capabilities for large trays, displays, and specialty needs. [...] Thermoforming {{is a method}} which uses vacuum, heat, and pressure to form the desired material into a shape determined by its mold. This type of packaging is often used by the cosmetic and medical industry.|$|E
2500|$|Earlier {{aircraft}} designs generally featured canopies {{consisting of}} small plates of perspex (called Plexiglas in the United States) {{in a metal}} framework, with {{the top of the}} canopy even with the rear fuselage. This design considerably limited visibility, especially to the rear. The introduction of <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> {{led to the creation of}} the [...] "bubble canopy" [...] which was largely self-supporting, and could be mounted over the cockpit, offering greatly improved all-round visibility. Tank's design for the Fw 190 used a canopy with a frame that ran around the perimeter, with only a short, centerline seam along the top, running rearward from the radio antenna fitting where the three-panel windscreen and forward edge of the canopy met, just in front of the pilot.|$|E

50|$|There are {{numerous}} patterns {{one can make}} with <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming.</b> The most inventive way to use <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> is to take any small item, replicate it many times and then vacuum for the new pattern {{to create a more}} cohesive form. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> helps tie the individual pieces together and make one mold out of many pieces that can easily be replicated. From there, you can cast plaster, concrete, etc. into the plastic form.|$|E
50|$|Suitable {{materials}} {{for use in}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> are conventionally thermoplastics. The most common and easiest to use thermoplastic is high impact polystyrene sheeting (HIPS). This is molded around a wood, structural foam or cast or machined aluminium mold, and can form to almost any shape. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> is also appropriate for transparent materials such as acrylic, which are widely used in applications for aerospace such as passenger cabin window canopies for military fixed wing aircraft and compartments for rotary wing aircraft. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> is often used in low-level technology classes for {{an easy way to}} mold.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{analyzed}} {{the percentage of}} Virginia practitioners utilizing <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> machines, types of appliances recommended, and types of patient information provided. Methods: Questionnaires were constructed and mailed to 2500 dentists. Results: 80 % of dentists utilized <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> machines, 42. 5 % recommended mouthguards, 60. 2 % recommended home bleaching trays, 37. 6 % provided patient information on mouthguards, 37. 1 % provided patient information on home bleaching trays, 16. 5 % inquired on patient questionnaires about mouthguard protection during contact sports,and 17. 3 % inquired on patient questionnaires about tooth color satisfaction. Conclusions: Dentists use <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> machines for home bleaching trays more than mouthguards. General dentists and pediatric dentists provide patient information on mouthguards and home bleaching trays more often than orthodontists. General dentists provide patient information on home bleaching trays more often than pediatric dentists. Dentists in practice 25 or more years {{are the most likely}} to have patient questionnaires that address the use of mouthguards...|$|R

50|$|Most modern acrylic {{canopies}} are <b>vacuum</b> <b>formed.</b> A {{sheet of}} acrylic is secured {{to a female}} mould, then the entire assembly is heated in an oven until the acrylic is pliable. The air is then removed from the mould and the acrylic sheet is drawn into it, forming {{the shape of the}} canopy. The acrylic is then trimmed to the appropriate shape and attached to an aluminum or composite frame. Some one-off canopies are made in a similar fashion, but since a mould would be too time-consuming to make, the acrylic is heated and <b>vacuum</b> <b>formed</b> until it approximates the shape the builder is seeking. This type of construction is less precise, however, and each canopy is unique. If multiple canopies will be needed, a mould is almost always used.|$|R
