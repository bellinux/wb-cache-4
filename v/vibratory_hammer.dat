40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. There are {{currently}} well established compaction methods {{being used in}} laboratories globally to prepare specimens for material testing. None of these methods provides the repeatability and reproducibility, ease of execution or simulation and correlation to field compaction desired by engineers. The research presented in this report was aimed at {{the development of a}} new or adapted compaction method for bituminous stabilized materials (BSM) that would address the aforementioned factors, by making use of a <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer.</b> Along with this, a new protocol was to be established. The initial <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> that was tested was the Kango 637 ®. This specific <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> suffered irreparable damage to the gearbox during the research. A replacement Kango hammer could not be purchased, therefore a substitute hammer was purchased i. e. a Bosch GSH 11 E®, for which back-up service and replacement parts are readily available throughout South Africa. Significant progress had been made with the development of a laboratory compaction protocol for BSM using the Kango Hammer. The specifications of the Bosch® hammer showed it was superior in terms of power, weight and other technical features. Comparative testing was therefore carried out. This allowed for the adaptation of the results achieved to that point. Extensive experimentation was then carried out using two types of BSM i. e. foamed bitumen (80 / 100 bitumen) and bitumen emulsion (60 / 40 Anionic Stable Grade) stabilized material. The initial material used for the experimentation was a G 2 quality graded crushed stone. Additional material was also obtained from a recycling project taking place along the N 7 near Cape Town. The N 7 material was used to perform correlation experiments so as to determine how representative the laboratory compacted specimens were to field compacted material. Results showed that the <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> is capable of producing specimens for testing in the laboratory as well as providing a possible benchmark method for accurately controlling the quality of work on site i. e. field density control. This was done by identifying the time to and level of refusal density compaction. The level of refusal density compaction was expressed as a percentage of Mod AASHTO compaction and using current specifications, a potentially new site compaction level specification was determined. In order to asses the material applicability of the <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> compaction method, tests regarding moisture sensitivity analysis were carried out on a G 5 material. The vibratory compaction protocol includes a specification for the type of hammer, guide-frame, surcharge weight, compaction moisture and number of layers. Vibratory compaction can be used to prepare two types of specimens: • Specimens for triaxial testing with a diameter of 150 mm and a height of 300 mm • Specimens for laboratory testing with a diameter of 150 mm and a height of 125 mm. Tests showed that the material properties prove to have an influence on the compactability of the material. Material from the N 7 recycling project had been milled out thus altering the grading and including some RAP. This in turn influenced compaction. The <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> moisture curve was found to shift slightly to the left when compared to the Mod AASHTO moisture curve. The variability of the <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> was found to be well below the specified variability of 15 %. Repeatability experiments on G 5 material indicate that <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> compaction may be used on lesser quality granular materials. A recommended procedure for the compaction of BSM was developed following the experimentation results...|$|E
30|$|During {{driving sleeve}} of cast-in-place piles by <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammers,</b> soils were {{squeezed}} into sleeve and then soil plugging was formed. The physic-mechanical {{properties of the}} soil plug have direct influence on the load transmission between the sleeve wall and soil plug. Nevertheless, the researches on this issue are insufficient. In this study, finite element and infinite element coupling model was introduced, through the commercial code ABAQUS, to simulate the full penetration process of the sleeve driven from the ground surface to the desired depth by applying <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammers.</b> The research {{results indicated that the}} cyclic shearing action decreases both in soil shear strength and in granular cementation force when the sleeve is driven by <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammers,</b> which leads to a partially plugged mode of the soil plug inside the sleeve.

When driving the sleeve, the annular soil arches forming in the soil plug at sleeve end induce a significant rise in the internal shaft resistance.

5000|$|<b>Vibratory</b> pile <b>hammers</b> {{contain a}} system of {{counter-rotating}} eccentric weights, powered by hydraulic motors, and designed {{in such a way}} that horizontal vibrations cancel out, while vertical vibrations are transmitted into the pile. The pile driving machine is lifted and positioned over the pile by means of an excavator or crane, and is fastened to the pile by a clamp and/or bolts. <b>Vibratory</b> <b>hammers</b> can either drive in or extract a pile; extraction is commonly used to recover steel [...] "H" [...] piles used in temporary foundation shoring. Hydraulic fluid is typically supplied to the driver by a diesel engine powered pump mounted in a trailer or van and connected to the driver head through a set of long hoses. When the pile driver is connected to a dragline excavator, it is powered by the excavator's own diesel engine. Vibratory pile drivers are often chosen to mitigate noise, as when the construction is very close to residence or office buildings, or when there is not enough vertical clearance above the foundation to permit use of a conventional pile hammer (for example when retrofitting additional piles to a bridge column or abutment footing). Hammers are available with several different vibration rates, ranging from about 1200 vibrations per minute to about 2400 VPM; the vibration rate chosen is influenced by soil conditions at the site and other factors such as power requirements and purchase price of the equipment.|$|R

Not only is it significant in ensuring the structural integrity of the material in the road layers, but it also has an influence on the engineering properties and performance of the soil material. A poorly compacted material is characterised by low density, high porosity and below standard shear strength. This, as a result causes rutting, moisture susceptibility, potholing, corrugations and passability problems on the road. Therefore, it is vitally important that field compaction is done correctly. For this reason, laboratory compaction methods have been developed to simulate the field compaction process in the laboratory. The Mod AASHTO test has long been used as the laboratory compaction method of choice by virtue of its simplicity and the lack of bulky equipment required. However, previous studies have established that the Modified AASHTO method does not adequately simulate field compaction criteria especially for cohesionless materials. Two reasons have been advanced; The Mod AASHTO compaction method does not adequately simulate the compaction done in the field when the granular mix is laid; The compaction method may cause disintegration of the material. Alternative tests have been considered and much research has focused upon the use of a modified demolition hammer (<b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer)</b> for laboratory compaction of granular materials. This study undertook to evaluate the influence of test factors pertinent to the <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> compaction method. The influence of these test factors on compaction time and obtainable material density was assessed with the objective of developing a compaction method for granular materials. <b>Vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> compaction tests were conducted on G 3 hornfels, G 4 hornfels and G 7 sandstone material types and to a lesser extent, reclaimed asphalt (RA). Densities obtained were referenced to Mod AASHTO compaction density. Findings of the study showed that, the mass of the tamping foot has a significant influence on the obtainable compaction density. Other factors such as, moisture content, frequency and frame rigidity were also found to affect compaction with the <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer.</b> In addition, it is shown that the surcharge load does not significantly influence the obtainable compaction density but does contribute to the confinement of the material and restricts the upward bounce of the hammer. On the basis of the results and findings, a compaction method was proposed, incorporating test parameters and factors that would provide ideal results for a set compaction time. Repeatability tests showed that, the developed <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> compaction method was effective in compacting graded crushed stone material types (i. e. G 3 and G 4) and probably RA. The test was not as effective on the G 7 material. Further studies on this material (G 7) are required. In addition to the previous testing regime, a comparative assessment of the developed <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> compaction method in relation to the vibratory table method was done. The results show that the <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> is capable of producing specimens of densities comparable to those of the vibratory table. A sieve analysis undertaken before and after compaction showed that compaction with the developed <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> compaction method does not result in any significant material disintegration. Based on the results of this study, a specification for the determination of maximum dry density and optimum moisture content of granular material using the <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> is recommended. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Kompaksie is een van die belangrikste prosesse in die konstruksie van die padplaveisel. Dit is nie net waardevol vir die versekering van strukturele integriteit van die materiaal, maar dit het ook 'n invloed op die ingenieurseienskappe en vermoë van die grond materiaal. 'n Swak gekompakteerde materiaal word gekenmerk deur 'n laë digtheid, hoë porositeit, on onvoldoende skuifweerstand. Die kenmerke maak die material vatbaar vir vogen. Lei tot spoorvorming, slaggate, golwe en deurgangs probleme op die pad. Dit is dus uiters noodsaaklik dat veld kompaksie korrek gedoen word. Om hierdie rede, is kompaksie metodes in die laboratorium ontwikkel om sodaend veldkompaksie te simuleer. Die “Mod AASHTO” laboratorium kompaksie toets is die gekose laboratorium kompaksie metode op grond van sy eenvoudigheid en gebruik van minimale toerusting. Vorige studies het egter bevestig dat die “Mod AASHTO”-metode nie veldkompaksie akkuraat kan simuleer nie, veral vir kohesielose materiaal. As gevolg van twee hoofredes; Die Mod AASHTO kompaksiemetode is nie ‘n realistiese en vergelykende simmulering van kompaksie soos dit in die veld gedoen word nie; Die kompaksie metode mag verbrokkeling van die materiaal veroorsaak. Alternatiewe toetse was oorweeg en baie navorsing het gefokus op die gebruik van 'n aangepaste vibrerende hamer. Hierdie studie het onderneem om verskeie relevante toetsfaktore van die vibrerende hamer en hul invloed op die kompaksie en verkrygbare digtheid te bestudeer. Die invloed van hierdie toetsfaktore op kompaksietyd en verkrygbare materiaal digtheid was geassesseer met die doel om 'n kompaksiemetode vir granulêre materiaal te ontwikkel. Vibrerende hammer kompaksietoetse was uitgevoer op G 3 hornfels, G 4 hornfels en G 7 sandsteen materiaal en tot 'n mindere mate herwinde asfalt. Digthede verkry was verwys na die Mod AASHTO kompaksie digtheid. Resultate van die studie het getoon dat die gewig van die stamp voet ‘n merkwaardige invloed het op die verkrygbare kompaksie digtheid. Ander faktore soos voginhoud, frekwensie en raam styfheid het ook getoon om kompaksiedigtheid te beïnvloed met die vibrerende hammer. Benewens was ook getoon dat die toeslaglading geen beduidende invloed het op die verkrygbare kompaksie digtheid nie, maar wel bydrae tot die inperking van die materiaal en verhoed die vertikale terugslag van die hammer. Gebaseer op die resultate en bevindinge was ‘n kompaksiemetode voorgestel wat toets parameters integreer met toetsfaktore en tot volg ideale resultate vir ‘n gegewe kompaksietyd voorsien. Herhaalde kalibrasie toetse het getoon dat die ontwikkelde kompaksiemetode effektief is in die kompaktering van gegradeerde gebreekte klip materiaaltipes (G 3 en G 4) en moontlik herwanne asfalt. Die toets was nie so doeltreffend op die G 7 materiaal nie. Verdere studies op hierdie materiaal (G 7) is dus nodig. Addisioneel tot die vorige toets, is bevind dat ‘n vergelykende assesering van die ontwikkelde vibrerende hammer kompaksiemetode in verhouding tot die vibrerende tafel. Die resultate wys dat die vibrerende hammer die vermoë het om toetsmonsters met digthede vergelykbaar met die vibrerende tafel te produseer. Sifanalise voor en na kompaksie het getoon dat verdigting met die ontwikkelde vibrerende hamer kompaksie metode nie lei tot die disintegrasie van die materiaal nie. Gebasseer op die resultate van dié studie was ‘n spesifikasie vir die bepaling van maksimum droé digtheid en optimale voginhoud van granulêre material aangeraai...|$|E

In order {{to find out how}} these factors affect the penetration rate of the pile in three major actors of vibratory pile driving: (i) the pile to be driven, (ii) the selected driving system, and (iii) the imposed soil conditions, field tests on steel sheet piles driven by vibratory driving technique in different soil conditions are conducted. The penetration rates of three different sheet pile types having up to four different lengths installed using two different vibratory driving systems are documented. Piles with different lengths and types driven with or without clutch have different penetration rates. The working parameters of <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer,</b> such as driving force and vibratory amplitude, have great influences on the penetration rate of the pile, especially at the later stages of the sinking process.

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} {{a brief history}} of the method of characteristics as an accurate solution of the wave equation, and the author’s experiences with the method of characteristics over a period of 30 years. As a result of the offshore pile driving activities associated with the development of the North Sea oil fields in the 1970 ’s, two Dutch companies initiated extensive research efforts. Heerema started to research the dynamic behavior of soil during driving and HBG (Hollandsche Beton Groep) extended the method of characteristics with a straightforward theoretical solution for the shaft friction along a pile. The research institute TNO started the development of the wave equation program TNOWAVE in the late 1970 ’s based on HBG’s friction model extension for the method of characteristics. Today the program has a worldwide application in the field of pile testing. This paper will describe its development and application over time and its relation to today’s applications for driveability studies for impact <b>hammers</b> (PDPWAVE) and <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammers</b> (VDPWAVE), signal matching for Dynamic Load Testing (DLTWAVE), Pile Integrity Testing signal matching (SITWAVE), and Statnamic simulation (STNWAVE).

40|$|Project of {{constructing}} a bridge and a navigation lock on Dammietta Branch of Delta Barrage {{is currently in}} progress where impact and <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammers</b> are used for concrete and sheet pile driving works. Energy generated from the force pulse is dissipated either as pile penetration or as radiated wave energy. These transient wave pulses can be characterizes by their peak particle velocity and its decay with distance from the pile, dominant frequency, and duration. Hammer rated energies are orders of magnitude less than kg of TNT. In some situations, typical monitoring equipment is often not able to withstand the extreme environment of close-in construction machines and these motions are difficult to measure. However, Pile type controls the amount of soil displaced during insertion and thus the amount of permanent displacement, densification, and the vibration generated. Vibration analyses were focused at the construction area and at the surrounding structures. Pile vibrators used in the construction operations produce high level of vibration capable of destroying any structure close to the source; however, material damping and attenuation coefficient are at the construction sites and the vibration levels attenuates very greatly with distance from the vibration source. Dynamic analyses were done on sections from the source of vibration to the surrounding structures to study the decay of vibration wave with distance, with kind of soil, with area topography, with trenches, and with water channels. Through field study of pile driving at the construction area, effect of pile driving on nearby structures are well determined and evaluated based on predicting vibration limits at different conditions...|$|R
40|$|Present {{guidance}} on levels of vibration generated by pile driving is primarily empirical, conservative and often contradictory. The {{objective of this}} research was to model the ground waves generated by pile driving using the ABAQUS finite element program in order to predict the free ground surface response resulting from installation by both impact and <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammers.</b> New procedures including infinite element and quiet boundary formulations have been developed for the computation of ground surface vibrations caused by impact and vibratory driving of pre-formed piles. The procedures do not require a detailed knowledge of site conditions and are therefore particularly useful as a preliminary design tool and for modelling the large amount of site data that currently exists in order to assist in the development of more rational guidance. The work has brought together research from several areas of study in order to produce computational procedures for modelling vibrations from pile driving. The new models have been validated by comparisons with measurements from various piling sites. The new methods now need to be applied to a large number of varied sites in order to develop site specific guidance. It is envisaged that this guidance could be in the form of design charts or simple formulae for incorporation into the relevant British Standards or Eurocodes. A range of common building forms has been incorporated into the models. The results indicate that slender frames can be analysed by transient displacements imposed on the foundations; however, a full three-dimensional analysis with soil-structure interaction is required for walls and infilled panels so that the reduced foundation displacements are modelled correctly.

Standards of other countries define the absorption according to density and compressive strength of the units. Higher absorptions are registered for blocks made of lighter weight aggregates, due to its greater absorption. Three sources of aggregates with different unit weight and absorption were selected for this research.

In addition, the compressive strength, bond and permeability were evaluated.

40|$|Bridge {{replacement}} project minimized sensitive resource impacts {{and constructed}} a bridge designed to last 75 years. As {{a result of}} the New Years Eve/Day storm of 2005 / 2006, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) had to close to all traffic the Russian River Bridge, a two-lane conventional highway east of Geyserville due to significant structural damage. This Bridge, constructed in 1932, is a 973. 5 -foot-long steel pony truss bridge located on State Highway 128 and connects the Counties of Sonoma and Napa. Pier 2 of the Bridge was damaged during Russian River storm flows approaching 60, 000 cubic feet per second (CFS). This damage consisted of the through and through cracking of the pier cap and web wall of Pier 2, the rotation of the pier in the downstream direction, and the dropping of the pony trusses approximately 9 inches. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), at the request of Caltrans, through its Damage Assessment procedures, determined that this Bridge could be rebuilt under the Emergency Opening provisions of 23 CFR 771. 117 (c) (9). This designation allows for a greatly reduced emphasis on NEPA, ESA, and other federal environmental rules and regula¬tions that would be normally applied to a bridge replacement project. In order to demolish the existing bridge a construction trestle, capable of supporting a 250 -ton crane, had to be con¬structed across the Russian River. This crane would be utilized to construct the trestle from land, demolish the damaged pony truss bridge, and construct the new bridge. The 50 ’-wide trestle was supported on 24 ” steel pipe piles averaging 80 ’ in length. The construction trestle, being constructed from both the east and west sides of the river, totaled 465 feet in length, and was completed in 70 days. Piles were primarily driven with a <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> or within an isolation casing, to reduce the impact on salmonids [Central California Coastal Steelhead (CCCS) (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and California Coastal Chinook salmon (CCCO) (O. tshawytscha) ] which are known to inhabit this reach of the Russian River. During the time that the trestle was being constructed, Caltrans bridge engineers, designers, and environmental personnel completed the Plans Specifications & Estimate (PS&E) for the new bridge in approximately 4 weeks. Once construction of the trestle was completed, demolition of the existing bridge began. Demolition commenced with the removal of the concrete deck, lifting of the pony trusses, and the toppling of the old piers. These piers were founded on 12 ” diameter 25 ’ long Douglas fir piles and there were 18 piles per pier. Once the piers were toppled, the Douglas fir piles were either extracted from the river bed or cut off approximately 3 ’ below the grade of the gravel bar. To the greatest extent possible, all demolition debris was prevented from falling into the river or onto the dry river bed. Hydroacoustic monitoring was conducted during pile driving activities within the wetted channel or within 30 ’ of the wetted channel. Recordings of the 24 ” trestle piles driven with the <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> could not be distinguished from the ambient river noise which ranged up to 170 dB (re 1 μPa) RMS. Diesel hammer driving of the 24 ” piles resulted in readings ranging up to 190 dB peak. Driving of the 48 ” steel shell production pipe piles to depths of up to 140 ’ resulted, in some cases, of readings up to 210 dB peak, even though the piles were being driven in a dewatered isolation casing. Construction of the new bridge, on the same alignment of the damaged and demolished bridge, began on May 1, 2006. The bridge was opened to all traffic on August 18 th, 2006, a total of 110 days. Extensive coordination with the resource agencies (Army Corps of Engineers, Regional Water Quality Control Board, California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service) was continuous throughout the entire construction period. A full time biological monitor was on site beginning in the middle of May. Caltrans personnel relocated to the main river channel trapped fish from the pools that remained after the demolition of the piers. Deconstruction of the trestle, including the extraction of the 24 ” piles, was completed in 15 days. Total construction costs were $ 26 million broken down as follows: $ 10. 5 M for the trestle, old bridge demolition, and pipe piles; $ 14 M for the new bridge; and $ 1. 5 M for contract change orders and landscaping. Caltrans, as compensation for impacts to Russian River fisheries due to this project, established a $ 2, 500, 000 fund to enhance and restore appropriate salmonid fisheries habitat within the Russian River watershed...|$|E
3000|$|The bearing {{capacity}} of a single pile shows the maximum load a pile can withstand under different modes of loading (compression, tension, lateral, etc.). The axial {{bearing capacity}} of a pile, q, is normally derived from frictional shaft capacity developed along the pile surface, q [...] s, and toe capacity derived from soil resistance under the toe of the pile, q [...] t [...]. The contribution {{of each of these}} bearing capacity components depends on the type of the soil as well as pile characteristics. The shaft resistance of piles is dependent on the interaction of the pile shaft and adjacent soils as well as the method of installation (i.e., driving, cast-in-place, and screw piling). Pile driving is normally performed using an impact or <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer</b> depending {{on the nature of the}} soil and design regulations. Different types of pile foundations including precast concrete pile, timbers, steel and composite piles can be installed using driving techniques. However, this technique might generate different levels of soil displacement depending on the geometry of the pile during pile driving. This soil displacement may be advantageous in cohesionless soils, as it could densify the surrounding soil and increase the shaft capacity of the pile. In cohesive soils, on the other hand, the pile driving may cause soil disturbance and alter the soil structure around the pile, and induce excess pore water pressure which, in turn, can reduce the pile capacity. According to De Mello [1], the process of change in soil structure can be divided into four stages. The first stage is the remoulding of the structure of the soil around the pile, which occurs during pile driving. The second stage is the variations in the state of stress of the soil and the pile, which is referred to as the formation of excess pore water pressure. This excess pore water pressure will reduce the effective stress of the soil and, hence, the shear strength of the soil for a specific period of time after driving. The third stage is defined as the dissipation of excess pore water pressure, which occurs at a certain rate depending on the soil permeability. Lastly, it is the increase in the soil strength overtime due to dissipation of the excess pore water pressure, and soil aging.|$|E
30|$|According to the coupled finite-infinite element {{modelling}} of sleeve penetration by <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammers,</b> {{the soil}} plugging effect during the penetration was investigated. The main conclusions were as followings: (1) During vibratory sleeve driving, the soil strength and cohesion decrease, which is induced by cyclic shearing action. As a result, soil plug is partially-plugged, and the penetration resistance {{is less than}} those by other installation methods; (2) In the vibratory penetration process, annular soil arches form inside the soil plug, which induces an obvious increase in internal shaft resistance. The soils within the active height of the soil plug undertake the {{major part of the}} internal shaft resistance; (3) A threshold value exists in the influence of the vibration frequency on internal shaft resistance. When the vibration frequency is less than the threshold value, internal shaft resistance decreases with the increase in vibratory frequency, which correspondingly reduces the degree of soil plug. When the vibration frequency reaches the threshold value, the influence of vibration frequency on internal shaft resistance can be ignored. Hence, the vibration frequency has little influence on the degree of soil plug; (4) The internal shaft resistance of the sleeve end gradually decreases as the sleeve diameter increases, while the internal shaft resistance in {{the upper part of the}} sleeves increases as the sleeve diameter increases. Moreover, the increase in sleeve diameter gradually decreases the degree of the soil plug. The internal shaft resistance depends closely on the soil layer properties as well; (5) During penetration of the sleeve, the distribution of soil plug resistance along the height of soil plug can be described by index curve. Soil plug resistance is mainly undertaken by the soils within the active height of soil plug. At the same time, the analytic expression of soil plug resistance during vibratory driving was given under the conditions of f ≥  25  Hz and 3.2 D < H <  15.5 D.|$|R
30|$|The {{phenomenon}} is well-known, but {{little is known}} about the mechanism of soil plug formation inside pipe piles, especially for the sleeve driven by <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammers.</b> The formation of a soil plug depends upon a number of factors, e.g. installation method, pile diameter, penetration depth, soil density, whereas the investigation on the influencing factors are still not complete. A lot of researches were conducted to evaluate the soil plugging effect during pipe pile driving. Based on the principle of static equilibrium, Randolph et al. (1991) developed the concept of active height of soil plug and established the one-dimensional static equilibrium equation. Holeyman et al. (2013) presented another analytic expression of the shaft resistance of vibratory driven pile taking account of the soil damping. The limitation of the 1  g model test (O’Neill and Raines 1991) is the same with that of the soil samples under low stress, therefore, the ideal stress condition required by the investigation of the soil plug can be achieved by the use of the geotechnical centrifuge. Nicola and Randolph (1997) analyzed the behavior of soil plug during pipe pile driving by model tests. It was found that the height of soil plug decreased with the increase in the relative compactness of the sands during pile jacking, but increased with the relative compactness of the sands during impact pile driving. Experimental studies of Xing et al. (2012) indicated that the height of soil plug inside impact-driven pipe pile increased as the pipe wall thickness decreased. The distribution of the shaft resistance was nonlinear along the pile length, and depended on the impact force and soil conditions. Tan and Lin (2013) found that the soil plug developed from partially plugged mode in the upper soft cohesive soils into fully plugged mode in the underlying medium dense to dense cohesionless soil layers, and the external shaft resistance was about two-thirds of shaft resistance through a series of steel pipe pile static penetration tests. Liyanapathirana et al. (2000) analyzed the behavior of the soil plug during impact pile driving with Eulerian finite element method, and their researches showed that the degree of soil plug inside the sleeve developed from unplugged mode to partially plugged mode. Thongmunee et al.

Collected data regarding underwater noise measurements indicate that pile driving operations, especially when impact hammers are used, can be potentially harmful for the marine ecosystem. In this paper, a linear semi-analytical model is developed {{for the study of the}} vibroacoustic behaviour of a coupled pile-soil-water system. The hammer is substituted by an external force applied at the head of the pile. The pile is described by a thin shell theory, whereas both soil and water are modelled as threedimensional continua. The solution is based on the dynamic sub-structuring technique. The total system is divided into two subsystems namely, the shell structure and the soil-fluid medium. The response of each sub-domain is expressed as a summation over a complete set of eigenfunctions. The orthogonality of the shell modes in vacuo and the bi-orthogonality of the acoustoelastic modes is utilized in order to meet the displacement compatibility and the force equilibrium at the interface of the two sub-systems. With the developed model, the wave radiation due to vibratory and impact pile driving is analysed. The influence of soil elasticity and soil stratification on the dynamics of the coupled system is examined. In addition, the energy launched by the hammer into the water and into the soil is investigated for both excitation types in order to highlight the main differences in the generated wave field.

Stakeholder concern often focuses on the potential for local displacement caused by impact piling, where piles are hammered into the seabed. To mitigate this threat, use of vibration piling, where piles are shaken into place with a <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer,</b> is often encouraged due to presumed impact reduction. However, data on comparative responses of cetaceans to these different noise sources are lacking. We studied the responses of bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises to both impact and vibration pile driving noise during harbor construction works in northeast Scotland, using passive acoustic monitoring devices to record cetacean activity and noise recorders to measure and predict received noise levels. Local abundance and patterns of occurrence of bottlenose dolphins were also compared with a five-year baseline. The median peak-to-peak source level estimated for impact piling was 240 dB re 1 μPa (single-pulse sound exposure level [SEL] 198 dB re 1 μPa 2 s), and the r. m. s. source level for vibration piling was 192 dB re 1 μPa. Predicted received broadband SEL values 812 m from the piling site were markedly lower due to high propagation loss: 133. 4 dB re 1 μPa 2 s (impact) and 128. 9 dB re 1 μPa 2 s (vibration). Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises were not excluded from sites in the vicinity of impact piling or vibration piling; nevertheless, some small effects were detected. Bottlenose dolphins spent a reduced period of time in the vicinity of construction works during both impact and vibration piling. The probability of occurrence of both cetacean species was also slightly less during periods of vibration piling. This work provides developers and managers with the first evidence of the comparative effects of vibration and impact piling on small cetaceans, enabling more informed risk assessments, policy frameworks, and mitigation plans. In particular, our results emphasize the need for better understanding of noise levels and behavioral responses to vibration piling before recommending its use to mitigate impact piling.

40|$|Civil {{engineering}} construction frequently requires {{the use of}} piles to carry structural loads to stronger ground strata or to control lateral ground movements. A variety of techniques are available to install piles into the ground. Of central interest to this research is the <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer,</b> or vibrodriver, which is the preferred method used to drive piles into granular soils.. The installation of sheet and bearing piles by vibrodriver causes periodic vibration in the adjacent ground which is severe very close to the piles, but attenuates with distance. A potential consequential effect of the vibrations that are caused by vibrodriving is ground compaction, which may be observed as differential surface settlement. It is desirable that vibration induced ground compaction settlement should be estimated for contracts where loose to medium-dense granular soils occur, especially when buildings on shallow foundations or poorly bedded service pipes are adjacent. It is unlikely that a simple in-situ soils test will allow accurate, specific estimates, but rather that a range of vibratory tests should be performed which can then be used as a knowledge base. Settlement trends and associated parameters can then be identified which will allow the prediction of settlement with reference to the in-situ soil and the ground vibration data. This argument forms the basis of the laboratory test programme. A range of granular soils were studied using an adapted 150 mm Rowe cell (a hydraulic oedometer). Use of the Rowe cell enabled samples to experience compaction under effective stress conditions that are appropriate for equivalent soils in the field. The complete cell was mounted on an electromagnetic shaker and after static consolidation, the samples were vibrated under maintained hydraulic load, at frequencies and accelerations that are appropriate for soils adjacent to vibrodrivers. Change in sample height was recorded for controlled vertical (and horizontal) vibrations, typically in the range of 0. lg to 5. 0 g at 25 Hz and 40 Hz. Soils were tested under a range of effective stresses and moisture content. The results of the laboratory programme and subsequent data analysis are presented in tables and diagrams. Expressions that describe a good relationship between acceleration, soil type, relative density and static load allow upperbound estimates of vibratory settlements to be made for accelerations of up to 6. 0 g. An additional expression is presented that accounts for the influence of moisture content, ground vibration frequency and vibration duration. Summary tables are presented that define categories of vibration induced ground compaction settlement based on settlement potential, risk and severity. The use of the settlement equations and the influence of various parameters are demonstrated for a range of example applications, hi addition, data is abstracted from case studies found in the literature and sites that were visited during the research. The abstracted data are then used to perform settlement estimates which are compared to the reported examples. Good correlation between observed and calculated settlement is demonstrated in many cases. However, in some instances, it appears that ground settlements were exacerbated by at least one additional mechanism, such as cumulative pore water pressure increase, or lateral movement of sheet piles, in addition, extraction of piles by vibrodriver appears to contribute significantly to the reported cases of ground settlement...|$|E
40|$|Modeling {{pile driving}} {{is a complex}} process, {{including}} vibrations generated from the driving hammer, propagating further through the pile and transferred to the surroundings at the pile-soil interface. The vibrations propagating through the ground interact with structures, potentially causing damage to both underground and structures at surface level or potentially disturbing their inhabitants. Prediction models of ground vibrations focus on estimating the vibrations at ground surface level. The prediction of vibration amplitude at different depths can be more useful at sites with sensitive ground conditions. A model predicting these subsurface vibrations, easily applicable in engineering practice is currently not available or not validated. One of the impediments in developing a model for predicting ground vibrations at different depths {{is the lack of}} field data for validation. The purpose of this thesis is to find a prediction model for ground vibrations at different depths below the surface level. The study is focused on vibrations induced by impact driving of open ended steel tubular piles. A literature study was conducted to gain theoretical knowledge on pile driving and ground vibrations. The model developed by Massarsch and Fellenius [15] was found in the literature and although it predicts ground vibrations at surface level, the adaptation of the model for predicting vibrations at different depths was studied. Vibration measurements from the field test performed in the Caland Canal have been analyzed. The soil profile at the site consists of sandy clay and clay layers overlying a dense sand layer. First, large diameter dolphin piles were driven by a <b>vibratory</b> <b>hammer.</b> When the pile toe reached the dense sand layer, the driving process was changed to impact hammering in order to change the characteristics of the vibrations transmitted through the soil. The pile driving was extensively monitored and particle velocities were recorded by 3 D geophones placed up to depths of NAP - 22 m (9. 50 m embedment depth). The prediction model of Massarsch and Fellenius [15] makes a distinction between the velocities of different wave types emitted from piles during impact driving. These waves are the shear waves propagating with a cylindrical wave front along the pile shaft and compression waves emitted at the pile toe, propagating with a spherical wave front. Surface waves resulting from wave reflection at ground surface are not considered in this thesis, as this research focuses on vibrations at different depths. Wave velocities are calculated from the hammer input energy, taking into account ground conditions and considering the vibration transmission efficacy which defines the amount of energy transmitted at the pile-soil interface. The model is adapted for open ended tubular piles. Due to the large diameter of the dolphin piles and the present soil conditions, the soil plugging effect and its contribution to dynamic soil resistance at the pile toe are ignored. Dynamic soil resistance at the pile toe is considered the source of spherical waves, while the soil resistance along the pile shaft is the source of cylindrical waves. The ratio between the pile cross section and the total area delimited by the external diameter is taken into account when calculating the dynamic soil resistance at the pile toe, resulting particle velocities of spherical waves smaller than unity. Therefore the cylindrical waves propagating from the pile shaft are considered the main source of ground vibrations. The results of the prediction model have been compared to vibration values measured in the field test. The predicted vibration amplitudes are a good approximation of the vibration levels measured in the sandy clay and clay layers. The predicted vibrations are of higher magnitude compared to the amplitude of vibrations recorded by the sensors placed in the dense sand layer.
