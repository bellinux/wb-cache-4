Anharmonic (cubic and semi-diagonal quartic) MP 2 /cc-pVTZ force fields in normal coordinates were computed to account for anharmonic vibrational effects, including zero-point contributions to the rotational constants and the electric dipole moment. A simultaneous weighted least-squares structural refinement was performed, resulting in the best semispectroscopic estimate of the re structure of VA. The refinement was based on experimentally measured ground-state rotational constants of two isotopologs of VA corrected to equilibrium values using MP 2 /cc-pVTZ vibration-rotation interaction constants and all-electron CCSD(T) / aug-cc-pVTZ structural constraints. The semispectroscopic re structure of VA agrees excellently with the high-level CCSD(T) /aug-cc-pVTZ ab initio structure.
