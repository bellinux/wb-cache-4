There are many religious places in the locality. An yearly fair is organized near the old and famous Ganinath temple in the Cinema Road area of Mahnar. And a yearly urs is also organized on mazar of Khaki baba in which people of all religions come and worship on that day. The famous mosque of Mahnar is Jama Masjid situated in the main market area. It is also going to be the big industrial area in future due to connectivity to the state capital patna [...] Investors are taking interest in the area due to its good connectivity to the capital Patna and future aspects as a new town. Some people have started water bottling plant and other type of industries in this area. But the main source for income is agricultural activities for mostly of the farmers. A jail is being proposed to be built near the pethiya and subdivision office on the way to station road as land has been acquired by the government. Mahnar is also the hometown of many prominent leaders of Bihar. Sri Ramvilas Paswan MP of hajipur & cabinet minister in government of India is also very attached to this area and Sri Raghubansh Prasad Singh (born in village Shahpur of mahnar) former cabinet minister in government of India and former MP of Vaishali constituency.

However, using oil based drilling fluids will create pollution and therefore, environmental regulations on discharge of such drilling fluids have become more stringent because it will give tremendous impacts on the marine life and ecosystem. This research is conducted to formulate a new environmental friendly drilling fluids using vegetable oils derived biodiesel to replace the oil based drilling fluids without reducing their performances.

40|$|BACKGROUND Various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> {{are used}} for cooking foods in India. Controversies have been created that {{consumption}} of certain <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> cause atherogenesis. A {{little is known about}} the effect of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> in hypercholesterolaemic conditions. Hypercholesterolaemia, mainly the increased plasma Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) has been implicated in the early development and progression of atherosclerosis and Coronary Heart Diseases (CHD). Current study is designed to assess the effect of various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> such as coconut, sunflower, palm, olive oil and vanaspati on lipid profile and oxidative stress parameters in rats fed on a high-cholesterol diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS Hypercholesterolaemia is induced by supplementing cholesterol with the basal diet. Reference dose of various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> were administered once daily for 90 days. After the treatment period of 90 days, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol and oxidative stress parameters are estimated and analysed. RESULTS In the present study, we observed the lipid-lowering effect of various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> in rats fed with high-cholesterol diet. Administration of cholesterol showed increased level of lipid profile. Concurrent administration of various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> with high-cholesterol diet caused a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol, LDL and VLDL cholesterol. This conclusion is made based on the observation that the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> were able to restore, at least partially, the lipid profile of hypercholesterolaemic rats. A decline of antioxidant status associated with an increase in lipid peroxidation was observed in all the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> treated groups. Among the oils, coconut oil showed a mild increase in High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and least increase in lipid peroxidation compared to other <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> treated groups. CONCLUSION Results suggest that the addition of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> showed a positive influence on lipid metabolism in hypercholesterolaemic rats. Among the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils,</b> coconut oil was found to be beneficial as it has more antioxidant property. These findings can provide useful information regarding the choice of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> in hypercholesterolaemic patients in future...|$|R
