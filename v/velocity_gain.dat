Multiple complex {{developmental}} disorder (MCDD) is {{a well-defined}} and validated behavioural subtype of pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and {{is thought to}} be associated with a higher risk of developing a schizophrenic spectrum disorder. The question was addressed whether patients with MCDD show the same psychophysiological abnormalities as seen in patients with schizophrenia. Method. Smooth pursuit eye movement (pursuit gain and saccadic parameters) was measured in children with either MCDD (n = 18) or autism (n = 18), and in age-and IQ-matched controls (n = 36), as well as in a group of adult patients with schizophrenia (n = 14) and a group of adult controls (n = 17).

40|$|Rationale: Smooth pursuit {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} observed in antipsychotic naive first-episode patients, suggesting that they are intrinsic to the illness. However, {{it is not clear}} whether these abnormalities are as severe as those observed in more chronic patients. In addition, although research suggests that there are no short-term effects of conventional antipsychotic medication, the effects of long-term antipsychotic medication on smooth pursuit eye movements are relatively unknown. Objectives: To determine the short and long term effects of antipsychotic medication on the smooth pursuit performance of first-episode and chronic patients with schizophrenia. Methods: We compared the smooth pursuit performance of antipsychotic-treated and untreated first-episode and chronic schizophrenic patients with healthy controls using a comprehensive range of performance measures. This included <b>velocity</b> <b>gain,</b> the number, type and size of intrusive and corrective saccades, and the average time between the change in direction of the target and the change in direction of the eye movement, a measure of subjects’ ability to predict target movement. Results: Chronic schizophrenic patients had significantly reduced <b>velocity</b> <b>gain,</b> took longer to respondto the change in target direction and made more catch-up saccades than both first-episode schizophrenic patients and controls. First-episode patients were impaired relative to controls only on the measure of <b>velocity</b> <b>gain.</b> There were no differences between antipsychoticnaive and treated first-episode patients. Antipsychoticfree chronic patients were significantly less impaired on <b>velocity</b> <b>gain</b> than matched continuously treated chronic patients. These results were not influenced by group differences in age and symptom severity. Conclusions: These results show that: 1) the main index of smooth pursuit, <b>velocity</b> <b>gain,</b> is impaired early in the course of schizophrenia; 2) whereas <b>velocity</b> <b>gain</b> is unaffected by short-term (weeks) medication, it is worsened by chronic (years) treatment; 3) other indices of smooth pursuit, catch-up saccades and ability to predict target movement, are adversely influenced by illness chronicity rather than medication...|$|E
40|$|Whilst most {{laboratory}} smooth pursuit {{tasks are}} {{performed in the}} dark, in everyday life pursuit commonly occurs over a structured background. This background provides a powerful stimulus to the optokinetic reflex (OKR), inducing a background “drag” on pursuit eye movements. An inability to inhibit {{the influence of the}} OKR may be a contributing factor to the dysfunctional pursuit performance observed in many schizophrenic patients. Smooth pursuit performance was measured in 23 first-episode schizophrenic patients and 23 healthy controls matched for age and estimated IQ, both in the dark and over a structured background (a random checkerboard of black and white squares). <b>Velocity</b> <b>gain</b> was measured, as well as the number and size of corrective saccades (catch-up saccades) and intrusive saccades (anticipatory saccades and square wave jerks).

The effect of the background was to lower <b>velocity</b> <b>gain</b> and increase the number of catch-up saccades to the same extent in schizophrenic patients and controls.

These results suggest that, although their overall level of performance was worse, the schizophrenic patients were as able as controls to inhibit the effect of the OKR.

The modified code is used to model 45 shots made with the NASA Ames 0. 5 inch light gas gun over an extremely wide variety of gun operating conditions. Good agreement is found between the experimental and theoretical piston velocities (maximum errors of +/- 2 % to +/- 6 %) and maximum powder pressures (maximum errors of +/- 10 % with good igniters). Overall, the agreement between the experimental and numerically calculated gun erosion values (within a factor of 2) was judged to be reasonably good, considering the complexity of the processes modelled. Experimental muzzle velocities agree very well (maximum errors of 0. 5 - 0. 7 km/sec) with theoretical muzzle velocities calculated with loading of the hydrogen gas with the ablated barrel wall material. Comparison of results for pump tube volumes of 100 %, 60 % and 40 % of an initial benchmark value show that, at the higher muzzle velocities, operation at 40 % pump tube volume produces much lower hydrogen loading and gun erosion and substantially lower maximum pressures in the gun. Large muzzle <b>velocity</b> <b>gains</b> (2. 4 - 5. 4 km/sec) are predicted upon driving the gun harder (that is, upon using, higher powder loads and/or lower hydrogen fill pressures) when hydrogen loading is neglected; much smaller muzzle <b>velocity</b> <b>gains</b> (1. 1 - 2. 2 km/sec) are predicted when hydrogen loading is taken into account.

40|$|AbstractEye or head {{rotation}} would influence perceived heading direction if it {{were coded}} by cells tuned only to retinal flow patterns that correspond to linear self-movement. We propose a model for heading detection based on motion templates that are also Gaussian-tuned {{to the amount of}} rotational flow. Such retinal flow templates allow explicit use of extra-retinal signals to create templates tuned to head-centric flow as seen by the stationary eye. Our model predicts an intermediate layer of ‘eye <b>velocity</b> <b>gain</b> fields’ in which ‘rate-coded’ eye velocity is multiplied with responses of templates sensitive to specific retinal flow patterns. By combination of the activities of one retinal flow template and many units with an eye <b>velocity</b> <b>gain</b> field, a new type of unit appears: its preferred retinal flow changes dynamically in accordance with the eye rotation velocity. This unit's activity becomes thereby approximately invariant to the amount of eye rotation. The units with eye <b>velocity</b> <b>gain</b> fields form the motion-analogue of the units with eye position gain fields found in area 7 a, which according to our general approach, are needed to transform position from retino-centric to head-centric coordinates. The rotation-tuned templates can also provide rate-coded visual estimates of eye rotation to allow a pure visual compensation for rotational flow. Our model is consistent with psychophysical data that indicate a role for extra-retinal as well as visual rotation signals in the correct perception of heading...|$|E
