40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{identity}} {{of a collection of}} published isolates obtained from biofilters exposed to <b>volatile</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> has been re-evaluated by ribosomal DNA sequence analysis. A number of misidentifications were revealed and hydrocarbon-degrading black yeasts commonly belonged to the closely related genera Exophiala and Cladophialophora, both anamorphs of Capronia in the Herpotrichiellaceae family (Chaetothyriales). Relatively little is known on the life cycle of these taxa, but based upon a survey on related strains deposited at the CBS collection (Utrecht, The Netherlands) it was evident that they can generally be characterized as micro-extremophiles. They occupy hostile micro-niches, such as the bark of trees, poisonous materials like oil spills or creosoted wood. These ecological features explain the exceptional biodegradation capacity and tolerance towards the growth-limiting conditions present in air biofilters. Some species in the group exhibit a remarkable pathogenic potential, their mycoses in healthy humans sometimes being fatal. Some of the strains examined appear to be closely related to this second group. Hence, additional studies on the potential biohazard of fungal biofiltration of <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are strongly recommended prior to the full-scale implementation of this technique. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Volatile</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (VAHs: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, mp-xylene, o-xylene, styrene, naphthalene) in {{residential}} indoor air in Brisbane, Australia were measured in 32 houses. The total VAHs (TVAHs) levels ranged between 2 and 137 å§¯m 3 and {{were lower than}} {{the most of the}} houses in the literature data. The VAHs were believed to originate from heat insulation systems, building material products as well motor vehicles but naphthalene and styrene originated from other sources. Internal garages had concentrations which are higher than the indoor air by 25 - 50 % due to the presence of motor vehicles and may be a major source of indoor VAHs. However indoor concentrations are higher than that in the outdoor ambient air. The age of the house was found to be negatively related to VAHs concentrations in the houses with the half-life of TVAH at approximately 13 years. The concentration levels of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and styrene are well below the guideline values set by agencies from Hong Kong, Japan, Germany and the WHO while the concentration level of naphthalene in one house exceeded the guideline value from Germany.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] Low {{exposures}} to <b>volatile</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and cytogenetic effects in peripheral {{white blood cells}} were determined in 25 healthy workers employed in different areas of a styrene production plant in the former German Democratic Republic. The results were compared with 25 healthy unexposed controls (matched for age and sex) employed in the same company. METHODS [...] The concentrations of <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> determined from active air sampling {{in all areas of}} the factory (styrene: 73 - 3540 micrograms/m 3 (4000 micrograms/m 3 styrene, ethylbenzene, benzene, and toluene; > 500 micrograms/m 3 xylenes), which was only intermittently occupied for short periods. Passive personal monitoring, biomonitoring of exhaled air and metabolites (mandelic, phenylglyoxylic, trans, trans-muconic, hippuric, o-, m- and p-methylhippuric acids, and phenol) in urine samples collected before and after an eight hour working shift was used to assess individual exposure. Questionnaires and examination of company records showed that the historical exposure was far higher than that measured. Genotoxic monitoring was performed by nuclease P 1 -enhanced 32 P-postlabelling of DNA adducts in peripheral blood monocytes, and DNA single strand breaks, sister chromatid exchange, and micronuclei in lymphocytes. The content of kinetochores in the micronuclei was determined by immunofluorescence with specific antibodies from the serum of CREST patients. RESULTS [...] No genotoxic effects related to exposure were detected by DNA adducts or DNA single strand breaks and sister chromatid exchange. The only effect related to exposure was an increase in kinetochore positive micronuclei in peripheral lymphocytes; the frequency of total micronuclei in peripheral lymphocytes did not change. Smoking was confirmed by measurement of plasma cotinine, and no confounding effect was found on any of the cytogenetic variables. CONCLUSIONS [...] Low occupational exposure to styrene, benzene, and ethylbenzene did not induce alterations of genotoxicological variables except kinetochore positive micronuclei. This is the first reported use of the CREST technique for an in vivo study in occupational toxicology, which thus could serve as a valuable and sensitive technique for toxicogenic monitoring...|$|R

Knowledge of hydrocarbon concentrations in urban air {{is essential for the}} assessment and prevention of health hazards and photochemical oxidant formation. Hydrocarbons in urban air were sampled on specially made triple-layer adsorbent cartridges. Easily carried equipment was used for the sampling. After thermal desorption, the hydrocarbons were analyzed by gas chromatography. An aluminium oxide column effected the separation of C 2 -C 6 alkenes. Detection was generally by flame ionization but optional photoionization detection was found to be advantageous for the selective detection of alkenes and alkadienes in the C 3 -C 5 region. A recently introduced technique based on differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) was compared with the gas chromatographic method for the determination of benzene and toluene in air. Proportions and exposure levels of hazardous hydrocarbons were determined in urban air. Ethene, propene, 1, 3 -butadiene and benzene made up approximately 5, 2, 0. 5 and 6 per cent by weight of non-methane hydrocarbons. The composition was different for cold-start and high-speed emissions. Among the four isomeric butenes, the 2 -butenes were prominent in petrol vapour and methylpropene in exhaust. The composition of pentenes was similar in petrol vapour and petrol exhaust. Concentrations of butadiene, reflecting outdoor urban exposure, were in the range of 0. 5 - 5 mg/m 3.

40|$|Western Research Institute (WRI) has {{developed}} new methodology and a test kit to screen soil or water samples for halogenated {{volatile organic compounds}} (HVOCs) in the field. The technology has been designated the X-Wand{trademark} screening tool. The new device uses a heated diode sensor that is commonly used to detect leaks of refrigerants from air conditioners, freezers, and refrigerators. This sensor is selective to halogens. It does not respond to <b>volatile</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> {{such as those in}} gasoline, and it is not affected by high humidity. In the current work, the heated diode leak detectors were modified further to provide units with rapid response and enhanced sensitivity. The limit of detection for trichloroethylene TCE in air is 0. 1 mg/m{sup 3 } (S/N = 2). The response to other HVOCS relative to TCE is similar. Variability between sensors and changes in a particular sensor over time can be compensated for by normalizing sensor readings to a maximum sensor reading at 1, 000 mg/m{sup 3 } TCE. The soil TCE screening method was expanded to include application to water samples. Assuming complete vaporization, the detection limit for TCE in soil is about 1 ug/kg (ppb) for a 25 -g sample in an 8 -oz jar. The detection limit for TCE in water is about 1 ug/L (ppb) for a 25 -mL sample in an 8 -oz jar. This is comparable to quantitation limits of EPA GC/MS laboratory methods. A draft ASTM method for screening TCE contaminated soils using a heated diode sensor was successfully submitted for concurrent main committee and subcommittee balloting in ASTM Committee D 34 on Waste Management.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} some methods of making human {{exposure}} estimates, aimed at describing the human exposure for selected air pollutants in Sweden that are suspected carcinogens. Nitrogen oxides (NOX) {{have been chosen}} as an indicator substance for estimating the concentration of the urban plume. Earlier investigations {{have shown that the}} traffic in Swedish cities contributes around 85 % to the measured NOx concentrations, and that most of the mutagenicity in urban air originates from traffic. The first section of this paper describes measurements in Stockholm of some unregulated light hydrocarbons, such as ethene, ethyne, propane, propene, butane, and isobutane. In addition, measurements of some <b>volatile</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are presented. Simultaneous measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) were made. The ratios between CO and the individual specific compounds were determined by linear regression analysis. By analysis of relationships between CO and NO X, NO concentrations {{can be used as a}} tracer to describe the exposure for these specific compounds. NOX are considered to be a better tracer than CO, because NOX or NO 2 values exist for many places over a long time, while CO is measured mostly in streets with high concentrations. At low concentrations, instruments that measure normal CO levels give no detectable signals. Through use of atmospheric dispersion models and models that describe how people live and work in urban areas it has been possible to describe the average exposure to NOx in cities of different sizes. The exposure to NOx for people living in the countryside has also been estimated. In this way, it has been possible to calculate the average exposure dose for NOX for the Swedish population. This figure is 23 pg/mi 3. By use of the relationships between NOX and specific compounds the average dose has been calculated for the following compounds: polyaromatic compounds (PAH); ethene, propene, and butadiene; benzene, toluene, and xylene; formaldehyde an...|$|R

As a case study, representative of the Mediterranean area, {{the process has been}} applied to 17 Catalan rivers (NE Spain), using the monitoring data collected between 1997 and 2006 in 207 different sampling sites. After an appropriate selection procedure, 52 parameters were finally used for the calculation of the local priority substance and site risk indexes. From the exposure point of view the most relevant substances at the Catalan scale were volatile organohalogen compounds (VOX) and <b>volatile</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (toluene and xylene), whereas the priority substance risk index points to dibromomethane (volatile organohalogen compound) and benzo-a-anthracene (PAH) as the most concerning compounds. The local and European priority substance indexes have been compared, showing minor differences. Finally, site risk indexes have been calculated and utilized for comparison of the chemical status of different sites. They can be conveniently displayed in quality geographical maps and are considered a valuable tool for the environmental management and risk assessment of the region under study.

The harmful effects of air pollutants on human beings and environment have been the major reason for efforts in sampling, analysis and control of their sources. The major pollutants emitted to atmosphere from stationary combustion processes are nitrogen oxides, inorganic acids, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon and soot. In the current work two methods are developed for sampling and analysis of <b>volatile</b> chlorinated <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and semi-volatile chlorinated <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> for example 2, 3, 7, 8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) by using solid sorbent, thermal desorption and high resolution GC-MS. The capacity of several solid sorbents is compared by breakthrough value and percentage recovery ofthe analyte from the sorbent. The thermal stability of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and PVC {{in the presence of}} metals is studied because PVC is a polymer commonly found in solid waste derived from medical waste, car recycling and electrical cable. Harmful pollutant emissions from combustion and pyrolysis of PVC are measured using the novel method developed in this work. The main inorganic volatile is HCl while benzene is the major volatile organic formed under pyrolysis and combustion conditions. The thermal degradation of PVC produces a large number of chlorinated <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon,</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> and short chain linear gases. A study is designed for control of harmful pollutants from combustion of PVC including HCl, <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon,</b> chlorinated <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and soot. It is reported that the presence of metal oxides have the ability to control the level of harmful emissions by facilitating the producing of more short chain linear gases.

The cytotoxic effects of naphthalene have been correlated {{with the formation of}} covalent protein adducts after the generation of reactive metabolites, but there is little information about the specific sites of adduction or on the amino acid targets of these metabolites. To better understand the chemical species produced when naphthalene metabolites react with proteins and peptides, we studied the formation and structure of the resulting adducts from the incubation of model peptides with naphthalene epoxide, naphthalene diol epoxide, 1, 2 -naphthoquinone, and 1, 4 -naphthoquinone using high resolution mass spectrometry. Identification of the binding sites, relative rates of depletion of the unadducted peptide, and selectivity of binding to amino acid residues were determined.

Oil and gas leakage rates reported in the United States (US), estimated by relating measured methane fluxes with natural gas production, vary from less than 1 % (e. g.

40|$|Diffusive sampler {{monitoring}} {{techniques were}} employed to assess the spatial variability of air pollutants associated with the Pinedale Anticline and Jonah Field {{oil and natural gas}} (O&NG) developments in the Upper Green River Basin, Wyoming. Diffusive sampling identified both the extent of wintertime ozone episodes and the distributions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOC) including BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene isomers), and <b>volatile</b> polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PAH), allowing the influence of different O&NG emission sources to be determined. Concentration isopleth mapping of both diffusive sampler and continuous ozone measurements showed the importance of localized production and advective transport. As for ozone, BTEX and NOx mixing ratios were elevated within O&NG development areas, with localized hotspots being evident. One BTEX hotspot was related to an area with intensive development activities, while a second was located around a water treatment and recycling facility. Contrastingly, NOx hotspots occurred at different locations, often being associated with vehicular emissions. Comparisons of observed selected PAH and VOC species ratios at a roadside site in the town of Pinedale with those measured in O&NG development areas show that traffic emissions contribute minimally to VOCs in these latter areas. Thus elevated levels of naphthalene, often observed at BTEX hotspots, must arise from non-traffic emission sources. Possible sources include waste gas incineration and contaminated water treatment. In addition we note that contour mapping of the spatial distribution of pollutant species concentrations determined by diffusive sampling has considerable potential utility for the validation of emission inventories.

To better understand the formation and occurrence of particulate hydroxylated polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> from residential wood log stove combustion, 9 hydroxylated polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and 2 hydroxy biphenyls were quantified in particles generated from four different types of wood logs (birch, spruce, pine, aspen) and two different combustion conditions (nominal and high burn rate). A previously developed method utilizing liquid chromatography photo ionization tandem mass spectrometry and pressurized liquid extraction was used. Polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> were analyzed along with hydroxylated polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The hydroxylated polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> emissions varied significantly across different wood types and burning conditions; the highest emissions for nominal burn rate were from spruce and for high burn rate from pine burning. Emissions from nominal burn rate corresponded on average to 15 % of the emissions from high burn rate, with average emissions of 218 mu g/MJ(fuel) and 32. 5 mu g/MJ(fuel) for high burn rate and nominal burn rate, respectively.

The total concentrations of polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (sigma(27) PAHs), excluding perylene, and potential carcinogenic polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (sigma cPAHs) in the sediments ranged from 60 to 202 ng/g (average: 137 ng/g) and 4 to 60 ng/g (average: 21 ng/g), respectively. Two-ring polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> were the dominant components accounting for approximately 54 % {{of the total}} polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> detected. The concentration of polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the sediments indicated low level contamination when compared to those reported for similar samples from {{other regions of the}} world. Polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> compound diagnostic ratios, phenanthrene/anthracene, and fluoranthene/pyrene suggested that the PAHs in the sediments were mainly from pyrogenic sources, which may have resulted from incomplete combustion of fossil fuel from surrounding industrial estates, or occasional forest burning in the Mangrove forest bordering the lagoon...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Hydrocarbon {{degrading}} bacteria {{were isolated}} from the petrol contaminated soil of Karachi to determine their biodegradation capabilities of <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> such as xylene, phenanthrene, naphthalene, biphenyl and anthracene. Twelve bacterial strains were isolated by culture enrichment technique in Bushnell Hass medium {{in the presence of}} petrol. Hydrocarbon degradation capabilities of bacterial strains were assessed by means of enumeration using spread-plate technique. Current study revealed that all of the twelve isolated bacterial strains were able to degrade <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> particularly Pseudomonas sp. SA 044, degraded all the tested five <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> while Burkholderia sp., Ralstonia sp., Stenotrophomonas sp., Micrococcus sp. and Staphylococcus sp. degraded three or more <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Naphthalene and phenanthrene were the most degraded <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{methodology}} for {{the prediction of}} properties of environmental relevance of polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> based on the conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS/COSMOtherm) is presented and evaluated, with a special focus on the aqueous solubility of polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and related <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PAHs). It is shown that the solubility predictions {{as well as their}} temperature dependence obtained for a set of 12 polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and two related <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are in good agreement with the experimental data. (Subcooled) Vapor pressures, Henryâs law constants as well as octanolâwater partition coefficients were also estimated and compared with experimental data showing the capability of the model to predict environmental related data with sufficient precision for practical purposes...|$|R
40|$|Phenanthrene, a low-molecular-weight {{polycyclic}} <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon,</b> was incubated {{with water}} samples from various reservoir systems in Tennessee {{to evaluate the}} potential for significant polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> degradation by the indigenous microbial populations. Biodegradation was assessed by comparison of total polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> substrate recovery in degradation flasks relative to sterile control flasks. During 1977 field studies, the mean phenanthrene biodegradation was approximately 80 % after a 4 -week incubation. Within a given habitat, 45 % of the total variability in phenanthrene biodegradation was attributable to the physical, chemical, and microbiological site characteristics examined. Polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> degradation was {{directly related to the}} historical environmental pollution of the sampling sites examined, the length of biodegradation assessment, temperature, and the molecular size of the polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> substrate...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} water {{hyacinth}} (Eichhornia crassipes) to adsorped polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> from contaminated soil leachate was examined. Results obtained from analysis using GC/FID indicated that naphthalene (8. 350 ?g/g) was the overall highest polycylic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> adsorped at pH 4. 0, while pyrene (0. 057 ?g/g) {{was the least}} adsorped polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> overall at pH 6. 0. In ascending the pH from 2. 0 to 6. 0, there wasnât any trend observed in PAH degradation, though, {{it was noted that}} polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> degradation increased from pH 2. 0 to 4. 0, and then, sharply decreased at pH 6. 0. This results thus lend credence to the fact that E. crassipes is a potential phytoremediator in removing polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> from contaminated waste streams. </p...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{the loading}} amount and loading {{order of the}} {{catalyst}} with Î³-alumina played {{a vital role in}} the formations of aromatics. Despite the loading order of the catalyst with Î³-alumina, the total aromatic yields for both groups had an upward trend with the increase of the catalyst with Î³-alumina. And the gasoline compositions for both groups demonstrated that the increased aromatics were at the expense of paraffins, olefins, and naphthenes. Besides, be compared with the Group I, the Group II had a larger range of aromatic yield from 12.28 to 20.27 Â wt%. Meanwhile, all single <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> went up gradually with the increasing catalyst with Î³-alumina. Among the single <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> formed, the C 8 <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> were the maximum followed by C 7 and C 9 <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Due to the limited pore structure and methylation of methanol, the formations of C 9 + and C 6 <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> were relatively lower. With respect to the effect of the loading order of the catalyst with Î³-alumina on the single <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> the single <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the Group II showed larger variations than those in the Group I.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 10 surface soil samples {{representing}} {{the entire area}} of Linfen City were collected and analyzed {{for the presence of}} 16 polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The total polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> concentration ranged from 1. 1 to 63. 7 mu g g(- 1). Analysis of the sources of contamination revealed that polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the soil were derived from combustion sources. Specifically, the primary source of polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> was coal combustion, but the samples were also effected to varying degrees by traffic emissions. Furthermore, increased levels of contamination were observed in northeast Linfen due to the distribution of industrial plants...|$|R
40|$|Micellar {{electrokinetic}} chromatography with a photodiode {{array detector}} has been employed for {{the separation of}} nitro-polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> including 2 -nitro-fluorene, 9 -nitro-anthracene, 3 -nitro-fluoranthene and 1 -nitro-pyrene. Sodium deoxycholate {{was used as a}} micelle-forming reagent. The effects of beta-cyclodextrin and the organic modifiers, methanol, acetonitrile and dimethylformamide, on the resolution of the nitro-polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> were studied. Acetonitrile and dimethylformamide were useful modifiers to separate highly hydrophobic nitro-polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Structure isomers, 3 -nitro-fluoranthene and 1 -nitro-pyrene, were not separated using beta-cyclodextrin as modifier.
