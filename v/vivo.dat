5|$|The {{activities}} and structures of proteins may {{be examined in}} vitro, in <b>vivo,</b> and in silico. In vitro studies of purified proteins in controlled environments are useful for learning how a protein carries out its function: for example, enzyme kinetics studies explore the chemical mechanism of an enzyme's catalytic activity and its relative affinity for various possible substrate molecules. By contrast, in <b>vivo</b> experiments can provide information about the physiological role of a protein {{in the context of}} a cell or even a whole organism. In silico studies use computational methods to study proteins.|$|E

40|$|The {{surge of}} {{interest}} in inter <b>vivos</b> transfers has sparked a debate over its motivations. However, most of the academic {{research has focused on}} developed economies; and similar to many other countries, empirical research is scarce in Malaysia too. This study, aims to unravel motives for inter <b>vivos</b> transfers among Malaysian Muslims. It employs logit regression analysis in which the data is collected by means of questionnaires from October to December 2012. This research discovers that exchange motive is more prevailing than altruism motive among the respondents. More inter <b>vivos</b> transfers are given to daughters, children who provide more services and children with low opportunity cost of their time. However, inter <b>vivos</b> gifts among Muslims in Malaysia have one distinctive feature, they {{have been a part of}} the Malay culturally defined sphere enriched by the Islamic law. This is called „hibah‟ in Malay language, which originates from an Arabic word. It is concluded that the cultural aspect of the inter <b>vivos</b> transfers provides enhanced information as to how the transfer mechanism work...|$|R

Structure, pH, temperature, light, oxygen, metal ions, intramolecular association, and intermolecular association with other compounds (copigments, sugars, proteins, degradation products, etc.) generally are known to affect the color and stability of anthocyanins. B-ring hydroxylation status and pH have been shown to mediate the degradation of anthocyanins to their phenolic acid and aldehyde constituents. Indeed, significant portions of ingested anthocyanins are likely to degrade to phenolic acids and aldehyde in <b>vivo,</b> following consumption.
