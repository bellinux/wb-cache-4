25|$|Most {{crystalline}} {{forms of}} silica {{are made of}} infinite arrangements of {SiO4} tetrahedra connected at their corners, with each oxygen atom linked to two silicon atoms. In the thermodynamically stable room-temperature form, α-quartz, these tetrahedra are linked in intertwined helical chains with two different Si–O distances (159.7 and 161.7pm) with a Si–O–Si angle of 144°. These helices can be either left- or right-handed, so that individual α-quartz crystals are optically active. At 537°C, this transforms quickly and reversibly into the similar β-quartz, with a change of the Si–O–Si angle to 155° but a retention of handedness. Further heating to 867°C results in another reversible phase transition to β-tridymite, in which some Si–O bonds are broken {{to allow for the}} arrangement of the {SiO4} tetrahedra into a more open and less dense hexagonal structure. This transition is slow and hence tridymite occurs as a metastable mineral even below this transition temperature; when cooled to about 120°C it quickly and reversibly transforms by slight displacements of individual silicon and oxygen atoms to α-tridymite, similarly to the transition from α-quartz to β-quartz. β-tridymite slowly transforms to cubic β-cristobalite at about 1470°C, which once again exists metastably below this transition temperature and transforms at 200–280°C to α-cristobalite via small atomic displacements. β-cristobalite melts at 1713°C; the freezing of silica from themelt is quite slow and vitrification, or the formation of a glass, is likely to occur instead. In <b>vitreous</b> <b>silica,</b> the {SiO4} tetrahedra remain corner-connected, but the symmetry and periodicity of the crystalline forms are lost. Because of the slow conversions between these three forms, it is possible upon rapid heating to melt β-quartz (1550°C) or β-tridymite (1703°C). Silica boils at approximately 2800°C. Other high-pressure forms of silica are known, such as coesite and stishovite: these are known in nature, formed under the shock pressure of a meteorite impact and then rapidly quenched to preserve the crystal structure. Similar melting and cooling of silica occurs following lightning strikes, forming glassy lechatelierite. W-silica is an unstable low-density form involving {SiO4} tetrahedra sharing opposite edges instead of corners, forming parallel chains similarly to silicon disulfide (SiS2) and silicon diselenide (SiSe2): it quickly returns to forming amorphous silica with heat or traces of water.|$|E

40|$|It is a {{challenge}} to calorimetrically determine the glass transition temperature (Tg) of <b>vitreous</b> <b>silica.</b> Here we demonstrate that this challenge mainly arises from the extreme sensitivity of the Tg to the hydroxyl content in <b>vitreous</b> <b>silica,</b> but also from the irreversibility of its glass transition when repeating the calorimetric scans.

In case of the opal matrix (densely packed silica spheres, pore diameter up to ~ 50 nm), crystallization of the ferroelectric BaTiO 3 appeared in coexistence with the amorphous phase, but the penetration depth of the crystalline BaTiO 3 was limited. From the apparent temperature independence of the effective wide-frequency dielectric response due to the essentially temperature independent effective soft mode stiffened to ~ 100 cm- 1, we can deduce that no macroscopic percolation of the crystalline BaTiO 3 has appeared in our opal matrix.
