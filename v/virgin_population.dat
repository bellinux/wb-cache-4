40|$|Abstract. —A <b>virgin</b> <b>population</b> of {{porbeagles}} Lamna nasus in {{the northwest}} Atlantic Ocean supported annual catches of up to 9, 000 metric tons (mt) in the early 1960 s before the fishery collapsed in 1967. Low and apparently sustainable catches of about 350 mt in the 1970 s and 1980 s allowed the stock to partially rebuild before a new fishery arose in the early 1990 s. The response of the population to this renewed fishing pressure has been unclear until now. However, a new population dynamics analysis suggests that population abundance has once again declined. On the basis of more than 140, 000 length measurements, an extensive catch rate index, a confirmed growth model, and a catch-at-age matrix, it appears that at least 90 % of the sexually mature population has been lost as fishing mortality has increased. Independent measures of fishing mortality (F) based on Petersen analysis of tag-recaptures, Paloheimo Zs, and a population model all suggest that fishing mortality was about 0. 20 in 2000. Biological reference points based on life table analysis indicate that fishing at F 0. 1 5 0. 18 will result in population collapse, that F 5 0. 08 corresponds to zero population growth, and that fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield is about 0. 04.

40|$|We used a sex- and age-structured {{model and}} CPUE data from {{commercial}} and research vessels {{to assess the}} current status of the tilefish, Loplwlatilus chamaeleonticeps, substock off South Carolina and Georgia. Based on commercial CPUE data and assumed natural mortality (M) rates of 0. 10 - 0. 25, we estimated that adult population density prior to fishing ranged from 603 to 950 per km 2 and stock biomass ranged from 1, 130 to 1, 570 tonnes (t). Our estimates of the recommended fishing mortality rate ranged from 0. 10 eM - 0. 10) to 0. 48 (M = 0. 25), resulting in sustainable yields of 40 (M - 0. 10) to 82 t eM = 0. 25) per year. We obtained higher estimates of <b>virgin</b> <b>population</b> density (883 - 1, 710 per km~ when research CPUE data were used. Sustained yield estimates also were higher, ranging from 55 (M - 0. 10) to 148 t (M = 0. 25) per year. Average estimates of recommended yield from commercial and research CPUE data were 58 and 95 t, respectively. Observed yields in the developing fishery exceeded 100 t in 1981 - 84 and in 1986; however, current observations indicate that fishing effort has declined to a low level in response to reduced catches. Based on the assumption that commercial CPUE data better reflect population trends, we recommend that the annual harvest not exceed about 50 t, which should result in a stock biomass of about 400 - 800 t.

40|$|The {{distribution}} and abundance of snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) near its southern {{limit of the}} Scotian Shelf is characterized from commercial fishing locations and from groundfish trawl surveys. Groundfish surveys also provide data on bottom temperature. Snow crab are most abundant on the eastern Scotian Shelf where bottom temperature is generally < 3 °C even in summer; they are absent from the deep central Shelf, "Scotian Gulf", which has access to warmer offshore waters. West of the Scotian Gulf snow crab abundance is low, likely ephemeral, and limited to pockets of cold bottom water. The fishery exploits most of the areas where snow crab {{are expected to be}} abundant on the Scotian Shelf. Mean annual catch rate by trawls was correlated with mean annual commercial catch rate for the 1980 – 94 period. There is some evidence of an endogenous cycle in recruitment, but other factors such as changes in bottom temperature appear important to snow crab production on the eastern Scotian Shelf. It cannot be resolved whether the high biomass {{at the beginning of the}} fishery resulted from a peak in a recruitment cycle, or from the accumulation of biomass of the <b>virgin</b> <b>population.</b> Year-classes that originated in the mid- 1970 s and those that entered the fishery from 1982 – 86 were small; those that supported high landings in the late- 1980 s and early- 1990 s may have been larger because of increased survival of early life-history stages, but the reasons for any increased survival are not clear. Lower temperatures after 1984 appear to have contributed to expanded habitat, and reduced predation from groundfish may have increased the survival and growth of juvenile and adolescent snow crab on the eastern Scotian Shelf...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, the {{occurence}} {{of tuberculosis}} and it's causes are studied with {{special attention to}} developments in Sweden. The perspective is a comparative one. Secular trends as well as shortterm fluctuations are analysed. The decrease in the mortality rate in the West {{that has taken place}} in recent centuries has primarily been the result of a decrease in infectious diseases. Among the factors which have been cited as having an decisive role are: the decline in the death rate, the role of therapy, genetic changes in man and microorganisms, the immunologic process, and most commonly, the general increase in living standards. Tuberculosis is a social disease that is extremely sensitive to changes in the standard of living. The disease is an infection that is primarely spread directly from human being to human being. The degree of crowding and the standard of housing are therefore important factors {{when it comes to the}} spreading of the disease. Usually, steady contact is required in order that the disease should be transmitted. Tuberculosis is also sensitive to nutrition. Persons with good diets are far more resistant to the disease than those suffering from mal­nutrition or those with a poor diet. A protein deficiency is particularly dangerous. A reduc­tion of nutritional intake together with a greater degree of crowding should thus lead to an increase in tuberculosis in societies where the disease is endemic. On the other hand, a decrease in the tuberculosis frequency presupposes better standards of nutrition and housing, at least for the period prior to modern chemotherapy. Where diet and housing operate against each other, the frequency and occurence of tuberculosis functions as measure of the net result. Tuberculosis is a disease that shows clear symptoms in the lethal stage. The disease has been sufficiently widespread to permit statistical analysis even in small areas. This makes it possible to test the applicability of tuberculosis as an indicator of alterations in living standards. However, this presupposes that the effects of biological determinants can be accounted for. These biological determinants consist of both biological elements of the human body and changes in microorganisms. In this disseration, therefore, the following hypotheses are tested: —   that the extent of tuberculosis in a given society is governed by immunological processes resulting in an epidemic wave, —   that variations in the numbers of deaths from tuberculosis are an expression of changes in the standard of living. In addition to these hypotheses, the question is raised as to whether it is possible to measure deaths due to tuberculosis in historical populations with attention to each of the following: (1) changes in age and sex distributions; (2) possible changes in the virulence of the bacillus; and (3) also the results of changes in the degree of competition from other diseases. In the study, statistics for causes of death for counties, towns and parishes in northern Sweden were used together with parochial records and a number of other sources from seven parish districts with differing socio-economic structures. The thesis shows that tuber­culosis was endemic in both Sweden and Finland from about 1750. In Norrland, the disease was one of the most common causes of death. Thus, we can reject the hypothesis that the high tuberculosis frequency in Norrland during the 19 th century was a result of a <b>virgin</b> <b>population</b> coming into initial contact with the disease. The regional distribution pattern and the rural/urban differences indicate a close relationship between different living standard factors. In the dissertation it is also shown that the age and sex structure was relatively constant during the period of study. Thus, we can reject the hypothesis of age transition. An age structure with an upper limit in youth is natural for the disease. The high level of tuberculosis in upper age strata during the 18 th and early 20 th centuries is seen as a residual effect of a higher tuberculosis mortality rate in earlier age cohorts. The major perspective is socio-economic, but the disease's histoire de mentalité has been treated. Popular beliefs concerning the disease and the attitudes formed in literature and in art — the myth-building that took place — is given particular treatment. The aim of this dissertation has been to investigate the relationship between bacilli, "human beings and society over a long period of time, 230 years. digitalisering@um...|$|E

However, much of the evidence to date is based on the reported effect of adding relatively impure NK cell populations to various in vitro cultures, and the effect on T cells has been contradictory. Here we report the inhibitory effect of highly purified CD 16 + NK cells on mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), using unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and purified T cells as responders. Marked inhibition was observed (up to 75 %) which was proportional to the number of CD 16 + cells present, and was abrogated by ultraviolet irradiation. In contrast, the addition of CD 16 + cells had no effect on the proliferative responses of five CD 4 + anti-DR 1 alloreactive T-cell clones. To test the relative sensitivity of previously primed versus virgin T cells to NK cell-mediated inhibition, freshly isolated T cells from PBMC were separated into LFA 3 + (memory) and LFA 3 - (<b>virgin)</b> <b>populations.</b> CD 16 + cells caused inhibition of proliferation of LFA 3 + but not LFA 3 - cells in an MLR.

The ultimate goal of the project has been to assess the conditions for a global regulation {{in the area and}} determine possible differences among exploited stocks. The areas selected are characterised by their importance in Norway lobster catch. The overall duration of the project has been three years. Sampling was concentrated in the first two years. Data analysis was conducted during the second and third years (1993 - 1995). The countries (areas) involved in the study, together with their target areas, were: Portugal (south coast of Algarve), Spain (Alboran and Catalan Seas), Italy (Ligurian, Tyrrhenian and Adriatic Seas) and Greece (Gulf of Euboikos). In order to make results perfectly comparable, each scientific subject has been developed by a specialised team using a unified and standardised methodology. From the biological standpoint, Norway lobster growth, reproduction, moult and feeding have been compared. Special studies on distribution and genetics have been also conducted. In the fisheries context, a comparison of fishing techniques has been undertaken. The fisheries studies have been complemented with reconstruction of <b>virgin</b> <b>populations,</b> comparison of yield per recruit, sensitivity analysis and transition analysis. Selectivity issues have been object of specific analyses. As a result of these studies, it is evident that Norway lobster populations in the Mediterranean follow a common life-cycle model. The differences among areas reported in this project respond to environmental variation and differential fishing pressure in each area. All populations are exploited near its carrying limit, although overexploitation is unlikely at this stage. However we identified varying levels of exploitation according to study areas: The Catalan, Tyrrhenian and Adriatic Seas populations are exploited at a high level; the Ligurian Sea and Euboikos Gulf populations at an intermediate level; and the Alboran Sea and Algarve populations are at a low level of exploitation. The regulation concepts could be applied globally to the Mediterranean, allowing for the differences observed. It is highly recommended that effort is not increased. It should rather be decreased as new technologies being implemented continuously are by themselves an effort increase. A effort reduction of 20 % is desirable to ensure that stocks are maintained at their current levels.

The new species, the Redcheek Goby, replaces the Greenbanded Goby on the island of Utila and has not been sighted at any other location, potentially one of the smallest ranges reported for a Caribbean reef fish. The COI barcode mtDNA sequence for the Redcheek Goby is 11. 2 % divergent from the original type population of the Greenbanded Goby from the U. S. Virgin Islands. However, Panamanian Greenbanded Gobies, with no red cheek stripe, show a similarly large 11. 3 % genetic distance from the type population (within-population sequence variation is less than 1 %). Despite the prominent marking difference, there is only a 3. 3 % sequence difference between Redcheek Gobies and Panamanian Greenbanded Gobies. These results highlight the lack of concordance between genetic and phenotypic divergence among cryptic lineages of reef fishes. The Panamanian population has some small meristic differences from the type population and is (reluctantly) described here as the new species Elacatinus panamensis. An unexpected 4. 3 % sequence difference between the adjacent Puerto Rican and <b>Virgin</b> Islands <b>populations</b> indicates that the Greenbanded Goby is likely to break up into inconveniently numerous discrete genetic lineages, presumably in allopatry.

At present, manatees of the genus Trichechus are represented by three allopatric species: T. senegalensis, the West African manatee, T. inunguis, the Amazonian manatee, and T. manatus, the West Indian manatee (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1986). The West Indian species is subdivided into two subspecies, the Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus) and the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris). Such subspeciation may reflect reproductive isolation brought on by the intemperate northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico and characteristically strong currents found in the Straits of Florida (Domning and Hayek, 1986). The Antillean manatee is found in eastern Mexico, Central America, northern and eastern South America, and in the Greater Antilles (Lefebvre et al., 1989). In Puerto Rico, the manatee is most abundant along the south and east coasts, particularly in the area of Fajardo and Ceiba (Roosevelt Roads Naval Station) and in the Jobos Bay area between Guayama and Salinas. In general, manatees are not abundant on the north coast although they are infrequently seen in areas immediately to the west of San Juan (Mignucci Giannoni, 1989, Caribbean Stranding Network, unpubl. data).

40|$|Caloric {{restriction}} (CR) is {{an important}} tool {{for the study of}} aging. Recent advances have shown a substantial genetic component of the response to CR, necessitating an expansion of available knowledge about the effects of CR on favored model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster for the study of genetics. The experiments and results described in this thesis indicate that CR produces lifespan extension in Drosophila that is similar to that reported for rodents. Furthermore, there are observable changes of body weight, body composition, and activity levels in response to diet for Drosophila that parallel similar findings in other organisms. ^ A substantial advantage to studying CR in Drosophila is the relative ease with which large populations can be used in the application of a biodemographic description for the response to CR. Age-specific mortality data shows that increased longevity as a response to decreased dietary calories in Drosophila occurs through a slowing of the rate of aging. Most importantly, diet can affect the rate of aging throughout the Drosophila lifespan, and institution of CR even at late ages produces a substantial prolongation of longevity. However, application of CR in mid- to late-life cannot fully reverse the aging process, and there is residual detriment to lifespan as a result of initially normal- or high-caloric diets. ^ This text also details an investigation of sex differences and the influence of reproduction on the relationship between CR and longevity in Drosophila. Studies of <b>virgin</b> fly <b>populations</b> and various diets designed to manipulate fertility indicate that the close relationship between fertility and longevity in Drosophila can be dissociated and that the primary effects of diet on lifespan do not occur as a result of modulations in fertility. Also, there is notable divergence in the response of the different sexes to CR beyond what has been previously reported, with an observed rebound in male longevity at very high caloric levels. These findings substantially advance our understanding of the relationship between diet and longevity in Drosophila, and will be of great use to investigators seeking to apply CR in Drosophila as a means for studying the progression of aging. ...|$|R

Monoclonal anti-Lyt 2. 2 antibody completely eliminated the suppressor cell activity, whereas anti-Lyt 1. 2 partially, but significantly, reduced the suppressor cell activity. The suppressor cell, then, may be or may require a Lyt 1, 2, 3 + cell with a relatively low density of the Lyt 1 antigen for activity. The Lyt phenotype of the IFNγ- producing cells was examined for both virgin and suppressor cell populations. Treatment of cells with either anti-Lyt 1. 2 or anti-Lyt 2. 2 completely eliminated IFNγ production in both virgin and suppressor cell cultures. Cocultivation of Lyt 1 + and Lyt 2 + cells in both virgin and suppressor cell cultures significantly restored the ability to produce IFNγ when cells were stimulated with staphylococcal enterotoxin A. For the virgin cells, this seems to indicate clearly that both Lyt 1 + and Lyt 2 + cells are required for IFN production, but that Lyt 1, 2, 3 + cells are not required. For the suppressor cell population this type of treatment resulted in IFNγ production comparable to that of the <b>virgin</b> cell <b>population.</b> The treatment eliminated or depleted Lyt 1, 2, 3 + cells from the suppressor cell population, thus providing additional evidence that a Lyt 1, 2, 3 + cell is required for suppressor cell activity. Treatment of spleen cells with anti-Lyt antibodies at the time that they were involved in ongoing IFNγ production showed that the IFNγ-producing cell is Lyt 2 +. At least a 1 : 1 ratio of virgin to suppressor cells was required for optimal suppression of IFNγ production by virgin spleen cells. This suggests that suppression involved cell-to-cell contact. Preliminary data showed that the suppressor cell activity could also be induced in in vitro cultures incubated with mitogen for 4 days. This is evidence that the suppressor cell is inducible and not necessarily recruited to the spleen from other lymphoid organs...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Eight {{strains of}} housefly, Musca domestica Linn., from two {{laboratories}} were intercrossed {{to form a}} stock <b>population.</b> <b>Virgin</b> males and females from the stock were collected, and nine sets, each consisting of twelve males mated to five females, were successively done. Pupae weight, adult weight, emergence time and egg production of the first batch were measured on four male and four female offspring from each of two dams mated to the same sire. Analyses of variance and covariance were made, and the heritability for each trait and genetic and phenotypic correlations among the traits were estimated. Heritability estimates of pupae weight and adult weight, 0. 32 ± 0. 24 and 0. 34 ± 0. 19 respectively, are reasonable considering that they are growth traits and are comparable with similar estimates in some other organisms. Heritability of the emergence time, 0. 72 ± 0. 30, was high. Heritability of egg production {{was considered to be}} zero and was low when compared with estimates of egg production in the fowl. Extimates of genetic correlations between pupae weight and adult weight, between pupae weight and emergence time, and between adult weight and emergence time were 0. 91, 0. 50, and 0. 62, respectively. Genetic correlations between egg production and the other traits cannot be estimated in this experiment. Phenotypic correlations were 0. 86, 0. 03, 0. 09, 0. 05, 0. 08, and - 0. 09 for between pupae weight and adult weight, between pupae weight and emergence time, between pupae weight and egg production, between adult weight and emergence time, between adult weight and egg production, and between emergence time and egg production, respectively. Selection index has been proven to be a very effective method in selection. Selection indexes were: I = - 0. 0504 Y₁ + 0. 7651 Y₂ + 0. 1969 Y₃ + 0. 0050 Y₄ for all four traits and I = - 0. 0438 Y₁ + 0. 7648 Y₂ + 0. 1959 Y₃ for the first three traits where Y₁, Y₂, Y₃ and Y₄ denote measurements of pupae weight, adult weight, emergence time, and egg production, respectively. The findings from this experiment can serve as fundamental information for subsequent selection studies in this population...|$|R
40|$|The {{genotypic}} {{diversity that}} occurs in natural populations of antagonistic microorganisms provides an enormous resource for improving biological control of plant diseases. In this study, we determined the diversity of indigenous 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) -producing Pseudomonas spp. occurring on roots of wheat grown in a soil naturally suppressive to take-all disease of wheat. Among 101 isolates, 16 different groups were identified by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. One RAPD group made up 50 % {{of the total population}} of DAPG-producing Pseudomonas spp. Both short- and long-term studies indicated that this dominant genotype, exemplified by P. fluorescens Q 8 r 1 - 96, is highly adapted to the wheat rhizosphere. Q 8 r 1 - 96 requires a much lower dose (only 10 to 100 CFU seed− 1 or soil− 1) to establish high rhizosphere population densities (107 CFU g of root− 1) than Q 2 - 87 and 1 M 1 - 96, two genotypically different, DAPG-producing P. fluorescens strains. Q 8 r 1 - 96 maintained a rhizosphere population density of approximately 105 CFU g of root− 1 after eight successive growth cycles of wheat in three different, raw <b>virgin</b> soils, whereas <b>populations</b> of Q 2 - 87 and 1 M 1 - 96 dropped relatively quickly after five cycles and were not detectable after seven cycles. In short-term studies, strains Q 8 r 1 - 96, Q 2 - 87, and 1 M 1 - 96 did not differ in their ability to suppress take-all. After eight successive growth cycles, however, Q 8 r 1 - 96 still provided control of take-all to the same level as obtained in the take-all suppressive soil, whereas Q 2 - 87 and 1 M 1 - 96 gave no control anymore. Biochemical analyses indicated that the superior rhizosphere competence of Q 8 r 1 - 96 is not related to in situ DAPG production levels. We postulate that certain rhizobacterial genotypes have evolved a preference for colonization of specific crops. By exploiting diversity of antagonistic rhizobacteria that share a common trait, biological control can be improved significantly...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of mathematical models used for modelling populations will be investigated. Mathematical models have many applications, {{these will be}} mentioned throughout the paper. Mathematical models are particularly useful for modelling fish populations. Most fish populations are not farmed, and fish are taken from their wild environment. Models must be used to monitor population levels, and to determine the affect of harvesting. The use of simplifications is common, as models that could more accurately model a biological system are very hard to solve and require many parameters that must be measured. For example a food web that exists in nature could potentially have 50 or more species, each with a complex life cycle and each having an equally complex interaction with other species in the food web. Food webs investigated will have at most three species, so analytic solutions can be found and {{to reduce the number}} of parameters. These species will usually be prey, predator and superpredator, but alternatively can be thought of as plant, herbivore and predator. This is the beauty of using mathematical modelling, predator-prey dynamics are analysed exactly the same way as herbivore-plant dynamics, even though biologically they are different. Different topologies of food webs will be examined to determine the affect of the topology on population dynamics. A single species can be modelled with age structure in its population, by using a partial differential equation. The model examined negates interactions between species, but allows a single species to be modelled in more detail. The partial differential equation model is approximated using an individual based model, where each individual in the population ages at a constant rate, and reproduction and mortality will not be deterministic. Both of these will occur as poisson processes. The individual based model developed is used to model the population of orange roughy in New Zealand waters. Parameters concerning recruitment and mortality of orange roughy are examined. The sensitivity of these parameters are investigated, as many published parameters are best estimates or educated guesses. Orange roughy has suffered severe losses due to fishing, the estimate of current biomass is just 20 % of <b>virgin</b> biomass. The <b>population</b> response to different harvesting rates is examined in detail, in particular to find if there is a sustainable harvest rate, given the population is currently so low...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} carries final {{figures on}} the reported incidence of notifiable diseases in 1975. Data are submitted to the Center for Disease Control by the individual States through the National Morbidity Reporting System and are supplemented by surveillance activities of the Bureau of Epidemiology and Bureau of State Services at CDC, {{as well as the}} National Center for Health Statistics, Health Services Administration. Totals for the United States do not include data from Guam, Puerto Rico, and the <b>Virgin</b> Islands. The <b>population</b> figures for 1977 used in computing rates are from the Bureau of the Census and are provisional estimates of the resident population as of July 1, 1977 (Table 1 and table 5). Estimates of the resident population by age are from Current Population Reports, Series P- 25, no. 721. Population figures from those States where diseases were not notifiable or where age specific data were not available were excluded from rate calculations. The morbidity data in this report represent cases reported to CDC through State health departments. The accuracy of reporting, that is, the number of cases that are reported to CDC as compared with the actual number that occur, varies with the disease. Some diseases, such as plague and rabies, that cause severe clinical illness and are associated with serious consequences are probably reported fairly completely. Diseases that are clinically mild and infrequently associated with serious consequences, such as salmonellosis and mumps, {{are less likely to be}} reported. Additionally, subclinical cases are seldom detected except in the course of special studies. Also, the degree of completeness of reporting is influenced by the diagnostic facilities available, the control measures in effect, and the interests and priorities of State and local officials responsible for disease control and surveillance. The data in this report stem from a variety of reporting mechanisms and motivations that seem to remain consistent; thus the analysis of trends is valid. For example, the age and seasonal distribution of these samples have been shown to be consistent over the years. In order not to delay the publication of this document, we have included provisional data from California. For confirmation of any of those data, contact the California State Department of Health.
