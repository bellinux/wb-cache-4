5|$|The {{mercury battery}} is a non-rechargeable {{electrochemical}} battery, a primary cell, that was {{common in the}} middle of the 20th century. It was used in a wide variety of applications and was available in various sizes, particularly button sizes. Its constant <b>voltage</b> <b>output</b> and long shelf life gave it a niche use for camera light meters and hearing aids. The mercury cell was effectively banned in most countries in the 1990s due to concerns about the mercury contaminating landfills.|$|E
5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC <b>voltage</b> <b>output</b> using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E
5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC <b>voltage</b> <b>output</b> by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E

We propose {{two kinds of}} converter: a buck-buck and a boost-boost converter. Multiple <b>voltage</b> <b>outputs</b> are controlled exclusively, using error voltage feedback. This approach requires a few additional components (a switch, a diode and a comparator), but requires no current sensors and {{does not depend on}} the value of <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> or <b>output</b> current.

25|$|Because it regenerates an <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> waveform, <b>output</b> distortion, {{which is}} {{typically}} less than 4%, {{is independent of}} any input voltage distortion, including notching.|$|R
25|$|Once {{avalanche}} breakdown has occurred, the thyristor continues to conduct, {{irrespective of the}} gate voltage, until: (a) the potential VAK is removed or (b) the current through the device (anode−cathode) becomes less than the holding current specified by the manufacturer. Hence VG can be a voltage pulse, such as the <b>voltage</b> <b>output</b> from a UJT relaxation oscillator.|$|E
25|$|The {{ignition}} coil's high <b>voltage</b> <b>output</b> {{is connected}} to the rotor that sits on top of the distributor shaft. Surrounding the rotor is the distributor cap. The arrangement sequentially directs the output of the secondary winding to the appropriate spark plugs. The high voltage from the coil's secondary (typically 20,000 to 50,000 volts) causes a spark to form across the gap of the spark plug that in turn ignites the compressed air-fuel mixture within the engine. It is the creation of this spark which consumes the energy that was stored in the ignition coil’s magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|Promising {{alternatives}} to Pt-based catalysts are Metal/Nitrogen/ Carbon-catalysts (M/N/C-catalysts). To achieve high power density, or output of power over {{surface area of}} the cell, a volumetric activity of at least 1/10 that of Pt-based catalysts must be met, along with good mass transport properties. While M/N/C-catalysts still demonstrate poorer volumetric activities than Pt-based catalysts, the reduced costs of such catalysts allows for greater loading to compensate. However, increasing the loading of M/N/C-catalysts also renders the catalytic layer thicker, impairing its mass transport properties. In other words, H2, O2, protons, and electrons have greater difficulty in migrating through the catalytic layer, decreasing the <b>voltage</b> <b>output</b> of the cell. While high microporosity of the M/N/C catalytic network results in high volumetric activity, improved mass transport properties are instead associated to macroporosity of the network. These M/N/C materials are synthesized using high temperature pyrolysis and other high temperature treatments of precursors containing the metal, nitrogen, and carbon.|$|E

2500|$|The {{advantage}} of the ribbon microphone when introduced was that the light ribbon had a much higher natural resonant frequency than diaphragms in existing microphones, above hearing range, so it had flatter response at high frequencies. [...] The <b>voltage</b> <b>output</b> of older ribbon microphones is typically quite low compared to a dynamic moving coil microphone, and a step-up transformer is used to increase the <b>voltage</b> <b>output</b> and increase the output impedance. Modern ribbon microphones do not suffer from this problem due to improved magnets and more efficient transformers and have output levels that can exceed typical stage dynamic microphones.|$|E

In the proposed method, input currents are controlled such that input power is constant, even for unbalanced mains. Thus, for the balanced mains converter it behaves like an ideal rectifier, and for unbalanced mains, low-frequency harmonics of the <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> are suppressed. The performance of the proposed control structure is verified by the numerical simulation of a 6 kW, 380 V/ 48 Vdc designed prototype...|$|R

Their <b>voltage</b> <b>output,</b> and so their dimming effect, was largely {{independent of the load}} applied so it was far easier to design the lighting that would be attached to each autotransformer channel.

2500|$|It is also {{possible}} to put the rectified waveform into a choke-input filter. [...] The advantage of this circuit is that the current waveform is smoother: current is drawn over the entire cycle, instead of being drawn in pulses at the peaks of AC voltage each half-cycle as in a capacitor input filter. [...] The disadvantage is that the <b>voltage</b> <b>output</b> is much lower – the average of an AC half-cycle rather than the peak; this is about 90% of the RMS voltage versus [...] times the RMS voltage (unloaded) for a capacitor input filter. [...] Offsetting this is superior voltage regulation and higher available current, which reduce peak voltage and ripple current demands on power supply components. [...] Inductors require cores of iron or other magnetic materials, and add weight and size. [...] Their use in power supplies for electronic equipment has therefore dwindled in favour of semiconductor circuits such as voltage regulators.|$|E
