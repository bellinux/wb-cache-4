In fact, the instructions book states that any properly-regulated amplifier delivering no more than 33V is unlikely to cause damage to the speaker. Electrostatic speakers are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's case, at the rated nominal impedance of 16 ohms, the limit of 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's power output reaches 15 watts (if it were driving a conventional load).|$|E

2500|$|All {{semiconductor}} detectors function rather inefficiently {{in crystal}} receivers, because the low <b>voltage</b> <b>input</b> to the detector {{is too low}} to result in much difference between forward better conduction direction, and the reverse weaker conduction. [...] To improve the sensitivity {{of some of the}} early crystal detectors, such as silicon carbide, a small forward bias voltage was applied across the detector by a battery and potentiometer. [...] The bias moves the diode's operating point higher on the detection curve producing more signal voltage at the expense of less signal current (higher impedance). There is a limit to the benefit that this produces, depending on the other impedances of the radio. [...] This improved sensitivity was caused by moving the DC operating point to a more desirable voltage-current operating point (impedance) on the junction's I-V curve. The battery did not power the radio, but only provided the biasing voltage which required little power.|$|E

50|$|A successive-approximation ADC uses a {{comparator}} to successively narrow a {{range that}} contains the <b>input</b> <b>voltage.</b> At each successive step, the converter compares the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> to the output of an internal {{digital to analog converter}} which might represent the midpoint of a selected voltage range. At each step in this process, the approximation is stored in a successive approximation register (SAR). For example, consider an <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> of 6.3 V and the initial range is 0 to 16 V. For the first step, the input 6.3 V is compared to 8 V (the midpoint of the 0-16 V range). The comparator reports that the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> is less than 8 V, so the SAR is updated to narrow the range to 0-8 V. For the second step, the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> is compared to 4 V (midpoint of 0-8). The comparator reports the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> is above 4 V, so the SAR is updated to reflect the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> is in the range 4-8 V. For the third step, the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> is compared with 6 V (halfway between 4 V and 8 V); the comparator reports the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> is greater than 6 volts, and search range becomes 6-8 V.
