The design included an experimental wing from by the plastics division of F. G. Miles, Ltd., built from a phenolic/asbestos fibre material stabilized with a paper honeycomb, the manufacturing technique being based on the <b>vacuum</b> <b>moulding</b> process pioneered by the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. The 60 ft span wing was {{to be made in}} two semi-span sections each consisting of one 30 ft moulding, considered to be the largest one-piece moulded phenolic/asbestos structures manufactured at that time. [...] The new wing also had a different section from that of the Crabpot, a laminar flow 6- digit NACA airfoil rather than the original 5-digit one. However, the structure proved much weaker under test than intended and was abandoned.|$|E

International audienceThe production of plywood represents a major proportion of engineered wood products. The traditional manufacturing process requires very thorough drying of the wood before gluing. Gluing green wood is a new technology which can be applied to plywood <b>vacuum</b> <b>moulding.</b> Gluing wood when it is in a green state can be done, because it can be dried by the vacuum at the same time that pressure is applied for the gluing. The main interest of this method is that it reduces considerably the number of steps in its manufacture. The aim of this paper is to propose a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in order to validate the use of the vacuum process with green veneers. The types of glue, the gluing techniques (by vacuum or traditional methods) and the wood varieties have been compared. The functional analysis focused on 4 traditional plywood in order to compare it with our product. The 5 products meet the quality requirements of plywood EN 13986 (2004). The environmental modelling was carried out according to the ISO 14040, standard of life cycle assessment, principles and framework, starting from existing data bases and from measurements taken on manufacturing sites and during the testing.

50|$|<b>Vacuum</b> bag <b>moulding</b> uses a {{flexible}} film to enclose the part and seal it from outside air. Vacuum bag material {{is available in}} a tube shape or a sheet of material. A vacuum is then drawn on the vacuum bag and atmospheric pressure compresses the part during the cure. When a tube shaped bag is used, the entire part can be enclosed within the bag. When using sheet bagging materials, {{the edges of the}} vacuum bag are sealed against the edges of the mould surface to enclose the part against an air-tight mould. When bagged in this way, the lower mold is a rigid structure and the upper surface of the part is formed by the flexible membrane vacuum bag. The flexible membrane can be a reusable silicone material or an extruded polymer film. After sealing the part inside the vacuum bag, a vacuum is drawn on the part (and held) during cure. This process can be performed at either ambient or elevated temperature with ambient atmospheric pressure acting upon the vacuum bag. A vacuum pump is typically used to draw a vacuum. An economical method of drawing a vacuum is with a venturi vacuum and air compressor.|$|R

The goals {{of this research}} have been to investigate this new process, {{with the aim of}} determining how the process could be used by the South African composites industry. This included factors such as suitable materials systems, and optimum process parameters. The RFI process is a new composite moulding method designed to allow fibre reinforced products to be manufactured with the ease of pre-preg materials while still allowing any dry reinforcement material to be used. The high pressures required for traditional manufacturing methods such as autoclaves, matched dies and R TM can be avoided while still having very accurate control over the fibre / resin ratio. Moreover, the RFI process is a "dry " process and hence avoids many of the environmental and health concerns associated with wet lay-up and vacuum bag techniques. Furthermore the simple lay-up process requires less skill than a wet lay-up and vacuum bag method. Through a combination of mathematical modelling and physical testing, a material system has been identified.

Experiments {{had been carried}} out to investigate their impact behaviour, damage characteristics and residual compression strength. Current aircraft pre-impregnated materials processed by autoclave moulding and also some low-cost fibre preforms using <b>vacuum</b> infusion <b>moulding</b> were compared in this research. Novel tufting technology and veils were taken into consideration to find a cost-efficient method of improving the damage resistance of carbon fibre panels. Initial damage was induced using a falling weight (2. 38 Kg) apparatus mounting a 16 mm hemispherical tip. Various energy levels were applied for different panels, but the energy to thickness ratio was constant. Visual inspection and ultrasonic C-scans were carried out to investigate both exterior and interior damage (fibre fracture, delamination, etc.). Micrographs of the cross-section through the impact point were employed to characterise the fracture mechanisms. The detailed Compression After Impact (CAI) procedure was recorded and presented in this thesis. In order to investigate how much ultimate compression strength was reduced by impact, plain compression strength was also measured. The behaviour of different materials, including damage size, damage shape and construction and residual compression strength were utilised in comparing the different effects on impact of different components such as fibre, fabric, interleaving of toughening layers and through thickness reinforcement. The results show that unidirectional fibre was more sensitive than woven fibre and that tufting and veils were the most affordable and efficient methods to improve the damage resistance of the laminates studied. Over 30 % increase in residual compression strength was achieved via these methods...|$|R
