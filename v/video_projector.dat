25|$|An LCD {{projector}} {{is a type}} of <b>video</b> <b>projector</b> for displaying video, images {{or computer}} data on a screen or other flat surface. It is a modern equivalent of the slide projector or overhead projector. To display images, LCD (liquid-crystal display) projectors typically send light from a metal-halide lamp through a prism or series of dichroic filters that separates light to three polysilicon panels – one each for the red, green and blue components of the video signal. The LCD projector was invented in 1984 by Gene Dolgoff.|$|E
25|$|Resonance of 4 (1994) is a {{collaborative}} music-creation artwork consisting of four adjacent stations, each comprising a small podium bearing a computer mouse, a 16-by-16 grid projected {{onto the floor}} from a <b>video</b> <b>projector</b> above, and a cursor connected to the mouse. Dots can be placed {{in each of the}} grid's cells by clicking with the mouse. A synchronized bar sweeps across all the grids simultaneously, triggering musical notes wherever a dot has been placed. Sound is relayed over a loudspeaker system, and the notes from all four stations are superimposed, although each station has its own musical tone. This work was shown at the Serious Games exhibition at the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle in 1996 and 1997 and at the Barbican Arts Centre, London in 1997.|$|E
500|$|In March 2007, Apple opposed a {{trademark}} application by startup Sector Labs, {{which sought to}} register [...] "Video Pod" [...] as a mark identifying goods associated with a <b>video</b> <b>projector</b> product.

In March 2012, the U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) ruled in Apple's favor and denied Sector Labs' registration, finding that the [...] "iPod" [...] mark was [...] "famous" [...] and therefore entitled to broad protection under U.S. trademark law.|$|E

2500|$|Engelbart, {{with the}} help of his {{geographically}} distributed team, and with Bill English directing the presentation's technical elements, demonstrated NLS's functions. The presentation used an Eidophor <b>video</b> <b>projector</b> that allowed the video output from the NLS computer to be displayed on a large 6.7-metre high screen so the audience could see what Engelbart was doing. Additionally, live video of him and his associates from ARC in Menlo Park, about 48 kilometers away, was combined with the computer's output on the Eidophor. [...] The Augment researchers also created two customized homemade modems at 1200 baud which were high-speed in 1968, linked via a leased line to transfer data from the computer workstation keyboard and mouse at Brooks Hall [...] to their Menlo Park headquarter's SDS-940 computer. [...] In order to provide live two-way video between the lab and the conference hall, two microwave links were used, relayed by a microwave van near the summit of a hill that overlooked both sites. English also commanded a video switcher that controlled what was displayed on the big screen. The camera operator in Menlo Park was Stewart Brand—at the time, a non-computer person, best known as the editor of the Whole Earth Catalog—who also advised Engelbart and the team about how to present the demo.|$|E
