The Majestic had a maximum speed of around [...] (see Performance below). To help {{with the increase in}} the bore, the cylinder block was considerably enlarged to allow for the fitting of completely new liners: dry liners as present on the One-O-Four were absent on the Majestic. The Borg-Warner transmission required repositioning of the starter motor and consequent modifications to the crankcase and cylinder block castings. The crankshaft has four main bearings, integral balance weights and a torsional <b>vibration</b> <b>damper</b> mounted at the front.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new self-powered <b>vibration</b> <b>damping</b> technique, {{which is an}} application of the enhanced synchronized switching harvesting technique. Compared with other self-powered <b>vibration</b> <b>damping</b> techniques, it not only shows its robustness (particularly facing environmental drifts), but also can harvest the energy and supply power to other electronic circuits, while does not simply dissipate the electrical energy. Experimental results show that a <b>vibration</b> <b>damping</b> of about 5 dB is achieved {{as a result of}} energy harvesting, in good agreement with the theory. In addition, the <b>vibration</b> <b>damping</b> system can be not only self-powered, but also supply power to other electronic circuits. In other words, there is a good trade-off between energy scavenging and <b>vibration</b> <b>damping.</b> Along with experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the ESSH implementation, we discuss the design of a device aimed at bridging the gap between research in this area and practical application.

40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{the present}} work is to study the effect of {{annealing}} on the <b>vibration</b> <b>damping</b> capacity of high-chromium (16 %) ferromagnetic steel. The alloys were prepared from raw materials of 99. 9 % purity melted in a {{high frequency induction furnace}} under high vacuum.

The inverted torsional pendulum method was used to evaluate the <b>vibration</b> <b>damping</b> capacity. The results indicated that the <b>vibration</b> <b>damping</b> capacity of the alloys is influenced by annealing and there exists a critical annealing temperature after 1000 ºC. The damping capacity increases quickly below the critical temperature since the magnetic domains move more easily. Keywords—Vibration, Damping, Ferromagnetic, Steel. I...|$|R
