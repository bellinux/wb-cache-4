The concept of cardiac valve transplantation for the replacement of semilunar valves was introduced by Lam et al in 1952 '. In about 1960 the first human cardiac valve allografts were implanted,, 3, Human donor valves have become a good alternative for other valve substitutes (porcine valve prostheses and mechanical valves) because of their superior hemodynamic performance {{and the absence of}} post-operative thrombosis and thromboembolism. Further, these valves are relatively resistant to endocarditis and recipients of human donor valves do not require anticoagulant therapy. At this moment, the valve allografts are stored at heart <b>valve</b> <b>banks.</b> In 1995, 68 heart <b>valve</b> <b>banks</b> were known world-wide'. Before the introduction of cryopreservation techniques, human valve allografts were stored at 4 "C in a nutrient medium containing an antibiotic solution, with a maximum storage time of 6 weeks 5 ".

A major {{challenge}} in tissue engineering of functional heart valves {{is to determine}} and mimic the dominant tissue structures that regulate heart valve function and in vivo survival. In native heart valves, the anisotropic matrix architecture assures sustained and adequate functioning under high-pressure conditions. Collagen, being the main load-bearing matrix component, contributes significantly to the biomechanical strength of the tissue. This study investigates the relationship between collagen content, collagen cross-links, and biomechanical behavior in human aortic heart valve leaflets and in tissue-engineered constructs. In the main loading direction (circumferential) of native valve leaflets, a significant positive linear correlation between modulus of elasticity and collagen cross-link concentration was found, whereas no correlation between modulus of elasticity and collagen content was found. Similar findings were observed in tissue-engineered constructs, where cross-link concentration was higher for dynamically strained constructs then for statically cultured controls. These findings suggest a dominant role for collagen cross-links over collagen content with respect to biomechanical tissue behavior in human heart valve leaflets. They further suggest that dynamic tissue straining in tissue engineering protocols can enhance cross-link concentration and biomechanical function...|$|R

We describe here the isolation from adult human hearts of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase-positive cells (ALPL+ cells) with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) characteristics. Samples from 24 adult cadaveric donors were obtained from a <b>valve</b> <b>bank.</b> Mean total ischemia time was 21. 5 ± 9. 1 hours. The success rate for the isolation of human heart-derived cells by the explant culture technique was 70 % for the right auricle (14 of 20 trials) and 33 % for the right ventricle (7 of 21 trials). The total auricle-derived cell population (TAD) was used for the purification of ALPL+ cells. TAD and ALPL+ cells expressed markers for MSC and pericytes. TAD cells and ALPL+ cells differentiated into adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondroblasts, and ALPL+ cells expressed markers of these three lineages more strongly than TAD cells, as shown by RT-PCR. This population therefore has a greater potential for differentiation into mesechymal lineages than TAD cells. Both cell populations express some markers of cardiac progenitors, such as GATA 4, CD 117 and VEGF. ALPL+ cells expressed troponin T and ABCG 2, which are also markers of the cardiac lineage. Heart samples from tissue banks could be considered as sources of MSC with putative commitment towards cardiac lineages, even after prolonged ischemia times...|$|R

Cryopreserved pulmonary valves have had mixed clinical results, however. The objectives {{of this study}} were to compare the mechanics of cryopreserved human aortic and pulmonary valve cusps and roots to determine if the pulmonary root can withstand the greater pressures of the aortic position. METHODS: Six aortic and six pulmonary valve roots were obtained from the Oxford <b>Valve</b> <b>Bank.</b> They were harvested during cardiac transplantation from hearts explanted for dilated cardiomyopathy (mean patient age 68 years). The whole roots were initially stored frozen at - 186 degrees C, then shipped packed on dry ice. After complete thawing, the roots were pressurized whole; test strips were then cut from the valve cusps, roots and sinuses and tested for stress/strain, stress relaxation, and ultimate failure strength. RESULTS: The pulmonary roots were more distensible (30 % versus 20 % strain to lock-up) and less compliant when loaded to aortic pressures. The pulmonary valve cusp and root tissue also showed greater extensibility and greater stiffness (lower compliance) when subjected to the same loads. CONCLUSION: We conclude that mechanical differences between aortic and pulmonary valve tissues are minimal. The pulmonary root should withstand the forces imposed on it when placed in the aortic position. However, if implanted whole, the pulmonary root will distend about 30 % more than the aortic root when subjected to aortic pressures. These geometric changes may affect valve function in the long term and should be appreciated when implanting a pulmonary valve graft...|$|R

The intake manifold fed both banks from inside the vee, but the exhaust ports had to pass between the cylinders to reach the outboard exhaust manifolds.

Ford flathead V8s were notorious for cracking blocks if their barely adequate cooling systems were overtaxed (such as in trucking or racing).

50|$|The narrow angle between {{cylinders}} {{allows the}} use of just one cylinder head - whereas wider angle Vee engines require two separate cylinder heads, one for each cylinder bank. The VR6 arrangement needs two overhead camshafts to drive all the valves, {{regardless of whether the}} engine has two valves per cylinder, or four per cylinder. This simplifies engine construction and reduces costs. In early VR6 engines with 12 valves (two per cylinder) two overhead camshafts were used. The forward camshaft (in the transversely mounted engine) has six cam lobes to control the three intake and three exhaust valves of the front cylinder bank, without using rockers. The rear camshaft is designed the same way, but controls the rear cylinder bank. The operating principle of this design is comparable to a single overhead camshaft (SOHC) design with intake and exhaust <b>valves</b> of one <b>bank</b> driven by one camshaft. The later VR6 engine designs with 24 valves (four per cylinder) had two overhead camshafts as well, however with a slight change of operation principle: In the 24 valve engine all intake valves are operated by the front camshaft (with the aid of rockers), while all the exhaust valves are operated by the rear camshaft (again with rockers). This operating principle is more akin to a double overhead camshaft (DOHC) design, with one camshaft for intake valves, and one for exhaust valves.|$|R

According to a September 2011 CNN article, a Sony spokesperson said that Sony added an arbitration clause to its PlayStation Network terms of service because [...] "the Supreme Court recently ruled in the AT&T case that language like this is enforceable". [...] PCWorld writer Jared Newman cited Sony and Microsoft as examples of companies that took advantage of Concepcion to add arbitration agreements with class action waivers. Drahozal and University of Georgia law professor Peter B. Rutledge wrote that Sony and Netflix added arbitration provisions following data breach class action litigation. [...] Other companies reported to have added arbitration provisions to their consumer contracts after Concepcion include Umpqua <b>Bank,</b> <b>Valve,</b> eBay, PayPal, Instagram, and StubHub. American Arbitration Association Senior Vice President Richard Naimark said {{that a number of}} companies increased their usage of consumer arbitration after Concepcion, while before Concepcion, the number of consumer arbitrations administered by the AAA had been declining. Rutledge and Drahozal wrote that the adoption of arbitration in franchise contracts did not significantly increase after Concepcion or American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant, a case decided in 2013 that closely followed Concepcion, casting doubt on the hypothesis that Concepcion would cause businesses to adopt arbitration en masse. In November 2015, Stephen L. Carter wrote that although he and other critics had predicted that businesses would introduce [...] "increasingly burdensome and one-sided arbitration clauses", [...] "this hasn't happened".|$|R
40|$|Basing {{their report}} on repeat visits in late 1992 to 75 large {{state-owned}} manufacturing enterprises (which had been earlier surveyed in mid- 1991), the authors present optimistic new {{evidence about the}} transformation of state-owned enterprises in Poland. This evidence shows state-owned enterprises {{in a much more}} favorable light than the stereotype of myopic, decapitalizing companies that dominates discussion of Poland's state manufacturing sector. Success stories are emerging, and the state sector is far from a write-off. Moreover, favorable evidence is drawn from all manufacturing sectors, attesting to thepotential for a diversified manufacturing base. The state-owned enterprises'operations are largely autonomous, so the positive adjustments indicate that decentralized approaches to transformation could work - if bolstered by appropriate managerial incentives. But several problems remain, and many issues have yet to be addressed. The authors examine various adjustment indicators (labor shedding, material and energy costs, bank borrowings, and export performance) and correlate these with firms classified by 1992 financial performance. (By 1992, presumably, the transitional measurement distortions of 1990 and 1991 had disappeared.) They show that significant differences exist between successful and unsuccessful firms. Managers in successful firms have tended to stress a change in product mix, have generally become more efficient in the use of materials and energy, have maintained labor productivity, and have shown restraint in setting wages and in borrowing from banks. The authors discuss key transformation issues: the disappearance of such safety <b>valves</b> as easy <b>bank</b> loans and interfirm credit, hardening of the microeconomic budget constraint, excess-wage tax reform, and, most important, managerial attitudes and incentives. To complete the picture, they correlate the results of manager interviews with the quantitative performance of firms. Essentially, firms have learned a good deal about operating in a market economy in the past three years, and managers have matured. The industrial revival showing up in economywide statistics can be regarded as a sustainable trend borne of genuine microeconomic adjustment.
