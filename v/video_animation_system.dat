40|$|With many visual speech {{animation}} techniques now available, {{there is}} a clear need for systematic perceptual evaluation schemes. We describe here our scheme and its application to a new video-realistic (potentially indistinguishable from real recorded <b>video)</b> visual-speech <b>animation</b> <b>system,</b> called Mary 101. Two types of experiments were performed: a) distinguishing visually between real and synthetic image-sequences of the same utterances, (“Turing tests”) and b) gauging visual speech recognition by comparing lip-reading performance of the real and synthetic image-sequences of the same utterances (“Intelligibility tests”). Subjects that were presented randomly with either real or synthetic image-sequences could not tell the synthetic from the real sequences above chance level. The same subjects when asked to lip-read the utterances from the same image-sequences recognized speech from real image-sequences significantly better than from synthetic ones. However, performance for both, real and synthetic, were at levels suggested in the literature on lip-reading. We conclude from the two experiments that the animation of Mary 101 is adequate for providing a percept of a talking head. However, additional effort is required to improve the animation for lip-reading purposes like rehabilitation and language learning...|$|R
40|$|Process {{algebraic}} architectural description languages {{provide a}} formal means for modeling software systems and assessing their properties. In order {{to bridge the}} gap between system modeling and system im- plementation, in this thesis an approach is proposed for automatically generating multithreaded object-oriented code from process algebraic architectural descriptions, in a way that preserves – under certain assumptions – the properties proved at the architectural level. The approach is divided into three phases, which are illustrated by means of a running example based on an audio processing system. First, we develop an architecture-driven technique for thread coordination management, which is completely automated through a suitable package. Second, we address the translation of the algebraically-specified behavior of the individual software units into thread templates, which will have to be filled in by the software developer according to certain guidelines. Third, we discuss performance issues related to the suitability of synthesizing monitors rather than threads from software unit descriptions that satisfy specific constraints. In addition to the running example, we present two case studies about a <b>video</b> <b>animation</b> repainting <b>system</b> and the implementation of a leader election algorithm, in order to summarize the whole approach. The outcome of this thesis is the implementation of the proposed approach in a translator called PADL 2 Java and its integration in the architecture-centric verification tool TwoTowers...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the role of <b>video</b> <b>animation</b> in the concept of pure substances and mixtures to differentiate the students’ concept mastery and determine which cognitive level more influenced by <b>video</b> <b>animation.</b> 	This study used quasi experimental method. Comparing pretest-posttest comparison group were used as research design in this study. The population were in grade 7 th A and B of Junior High School students in Lab School Bandung. This study used random sampling technique and chose two classess as experimental group and control group. Experimental group was given treatment by showing <b>video</b> <b>animation</b> in the learning process, meanwhile control group was given by powerpoint presentation in the learning process. The matching of normalized gain between experimental group (0. 35) and control group (0. 24) shows that the showing <b>video</b> <b>animation</b> is more effective in increasing students’ concept mastery in the concept of separation pure substances and mixtures in experimental group. So, showing <b>video</b> <b>animation</b> made an significant difference between experimental and control group. Showing <b>video</b> <b>animation</b> is more influence in analyzing ability (C 4) and evaluating ability (C 5). It can be concluded that showing <b>video</b> <b>animation</b> in learning process make the students easily understand in their study...|$|R

Using the newly invented Lyon Lamb Video Rotoscope, Lamb animated live footage of Tom Waits, creating {{what appears to be}} the first American, rotoscoped, animated rock video. Released in 1979, and largely hidden from the public eye since, the video would eventually see a second life when it went viral on YouTube almost 30 years later.|$|E

English Education Department. Faculty of Tarbiyah and Teacher Training. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) of Tulungagung. Advisor: Dr. Nurul Chojimah M. Pd Key word : students’ perception, <b>video</b> <b>animation,</b> {{teaching}} listening 	Background of {{this study}} is listening is one of English language skill considered important in our life. But, sometimes teacher still focused on the old learning media, it make the students’ look passive in learning process [...] So, the researcher thought {{that there should be a}} solution to complete the problem. The researcher tried to use <b>video</b> <b>animation</b> to complete the problem and to know students perception by using this media. 	The formulation of the research problem: 1. How is students’ perception on the use <b>video</b> <b>animation</b> in the teaching of listening at SMAN 1 Pakel?. 2. What are the advantages of using <b>video</b> <b>animation</b> in the teaching of listening at SMAN 1 Pakel. The purpose {{of this study}}: 1. to identify students perception in the implementation of <b>video</b> <b>animation</b> in teaching of listening to the first graders’ in SMAN 1 Pakel. 2. To know the advantages of <b>video</b> <b>animation</b> to the first grade in SMAN 1 Pakel. 	Research method: 1) The research design in this study was mixed-method 2) The data are students’ answer on questionnaire responses and Data source have been obtained from how is students’ perception and the advantages of using <b>video</b> <b>animation</b> to teaching of listening 3) Technique of data collection is interview and questionnaire. 4) Technique of data verification is used triangulation to verivy the data. 5) Data analysis is researcher collected information from three steps organizing summarizing and interpreting the data. 	The result of this study: Students’ perception here focused on three aspect, 1) aspect of sound, 2) aspect of picture, 3) aspect of benefit. The conclusion of the three aspect is most of students have liked to learning English by using <b>video</b> <b>animation,</b> because that is have natural conversation, very good looking from the color and suitable for viewing to all age...|$|R
