50|$|In virology, {{temperate}} {{refers to}} the ability of some bacteriophages (notably coliphage λ) to display a lysogenic life cycle. Many (but not all) temperate phages can integrate their genomes into their host bacterium's chromosome, together becoming a lysogen as the phage genome becomes a prophage. A temperate phage is also able to undergo a productive, typically lytic life cycle, where the prophage is expressed, replicates the phage genome, and produces phage progeny, which then leave the bacterium. With phage the term virulent is often used as an antonym to temperate, but more strictly a <b>virulent</b> <b>phage</b> is one that has lost its ability to display lysogeny through mutation rather than a phage lineage with no genetic potential to ever display lysogeny (which more properly would be described as an obligately lytic phage).|$|E
50|$|The virus's {{nucleic acid}} uses the host cell’s {{metabolic}} machinery to make {{large amounts of}} viral components. In the case of DNA viruses, the DNA transcribes itself into messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that are then used to direct the cell's ribosomes. One of the first polypeptides to be translated destroys the host's DNA. In retroviruses (which inject an RNA strand), a unique enzyme called reverse transcriptase transcribes the viral RNA into DNA, which is then transcribed again into RNA. Once the viral DNA has taken control it induces the host cell's machinery to synthesize viral DNA, protein and starts multiplying.About 25 minutes after initial infection, approximately 200 new bacteriophages are formed and the bacterial cell bursts, i.e. it has undergone lysis. Newly formed phages are released to infect other bacteria and another lytic cycle begins. The phage which causes lysis of the host is called a lytic or <b>virulent</b> <b>phage.</b> The biosynthesis is (e.g. T4) regulated in three phases of mRNA production followed by a phase of protein production.|$|E
40|$|Thirteen <b>virulent</b> <b>phages</b> and two {{temperate}} phages of two {{closely related}} bacterial species (Lactobacillus lactis and L. bulgaricus) were compared for their protein composition, their antigenic properties, their restriction endonuclease patterns, and their DNA homology. The immunoblotting {{studies and the}} DNA-DNA hybridizations showed that the phages could be differentiated into two groups. One group contained 2 temperate phages of L. bulgaricus and 11 <b>virulent</b> <b>phages</b> of L. lactis. Inside each group, at least two common proteins of identical sizes could be detected for each phage. These proteins were able to cross-react in immunoblotting experiments with an antiserum raised against one phage of the same group. Temperate phage DNAs showed partial homology with DNAs from some <b>virulent</b> <b>phages.</b> These homologies seem to be located on the region coding for the structural proteins since recombinant plasmids coding {{for one of the}} major phage proteins of one phage were able to hybridize with the DNAs from phages of the same group. These results suggest that temperate and <b>virulent</b> <b>phages</b> may be related to one another...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} genetic {{organisation}} of six prophages {{present in the}} genome of Lactococcus lactis IL 1403. The three larger prophages (36 – 42 kb), belong to the already described P 335 group of temperate phages, whereas the three smaller ones (13 – 15 kb) are most probably satellites relying on helper phage(s) for multiplication. These data give a new insight into the genetic structure of lactococcal phage populations. P 335 temperate phages have variable genomes, sharing homology over only 10 – 33 % of their length. In contrast, <b>virulent</b> <b>phages</b> have highly similar genomes sharing homology over > 90 % of their length. Further analysis of genetic structure in all known groups of phages active on other bacterial hosts such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium and Streptococcus thermophilus confirmed the existence of two types of genetic structure related to the phage way of life. This might reflect different intensities of horizontal DNA exchange: low among purely <b>virulent</b> <b>phages</b> and high among temperate phages and their lytic homologues. We suggest that the constraints on genetic exchange among purely <b>virulent</b> <b>phages</b> reflect their optimal genetic organisation, adapted to a more specialised and extreme form of parasitism than temperate/lytic phages...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 113 strains of {{mesophilic}} strains lactic streptococci {{of the species}} Streptococcus lactis, S. lactis subsp. diacetilactis, and S. cremoris, chosen from 291 strains that had been previously classified into six groups {{on the basis of}} their sensitivity to 132 <b>virulent</b> <b>phages,</b> were subjected to induction with mitomycin C. Among these strains, 43 % produced phages capable of forming plaques of lysis on an indicator strain either spontaneously or after induction. There was a close correlation between the lytic spectra of temperate and <b>virulent</b> <b>phages.</b> Among the strains studied, 25 % were shown to be indicator strains. These results emphasized the high probability of development of temperate phages in a starter culture containing mesophilic lactic streptococci and therefore their importance as a cause of accidents in cheese making...|$|R
40|$|To {{eliminate}} {{the occurrence of}} <b>virulent</b> <b>phage</b> in industrial fermentation, {{attempts were made to}} obtain prophage-cured derivatives from Lactobacillus casei lysogenic strain S- 1. A thermoinducible mutant lysogen was isolated from mutagenized strain S- 1, since S- 1 cannot be induced under laboratory conditions. The mutation responsible for thermoinducibility was located on the prophage. Prophage-cured strains were selected after heat induction of the mutant. These cured strains did not produce the <b>virulent</b> <b>phage</b> and should be valuable for industrial fermentation...|$|E

The mv 4 genome region containing these elements was compared at the nucleotide and amino acid levels {{with that of the}} closely related <b>virulent</b> <b>phage</b> LL-H. Complex DNA rearrangements were identified; a truncated integrase gene and two sites homologous to the mv 4 attP site were detected in the genome of the <b>virulent</b> <b>phage</b> LL-H.

40|$|Bacteriophage (or ‘phage’) are {{viruses that}} infect and {{reproduce}} within their bacterial hosts. They {{have a major}} global impact on bacterial evolution and ecology, and might influence the pathogenicity of their host bacterium by providing virulence factors. Phage can either be described as “virulent” or “temperate”; the distinguishing feature {{between the two is}} their method of replication. This study sought to identify phage sequences within bacterial host genomes and determine the life cycle of the phage, exploring whether there is a connection between defective phage and previously <b>virulent</b> <b>phage.</b> It would normally be expected that any phage sequences identified within a bacterial host would have a temperate life cycle, since only temperate phage enter the lysogenic cycle and insert their DNA into the host as a ‘prophage,’ while <b>virulent</b> <b>phage</b> replicate via the lytic cycle, in which phage DNA replicates separately from that of the host’s and infected cells are lysed. Defective phage–‘zombies’ in bacterial genomes–are dormant phage that have become inactive through mutational decay or some other process. It is possible that some of these defective phage are in fact previously <b>virulent</b> <b>phage</b> that have become accidentally inserted within the host genome. This study detected phage within bacterial genomes using the prophage identification tools PHAge Search Tool (PHAST) and Prophage Finder. Identified sequences were categorized as ‘intact,’ ‘questionable,’ or ‘incomplete’; questionable and incomplete phage were classified as defective. The lifestyles of the uncovered phage sequences were then determined using PHACTS; six phage were identified as possibly virulent. The life cycles of the phage were further analyzed by assessing the genomic signature distances (GSD) and codon adaptation indexes (CAI) for each phage. Three phage were shown to have a GSD consistent with a virulent life cycle, and the CAI values of four phage corresponded with that of <b>virulent</b> <b>phage.</b> Although previous studies have indicated that some <b>virulent</b> <b>phage</b> may have a temperate lineage, identifying prophage as previously virulent is a novel finding. This has implications for our understanding of phage life cycles and the infection process, as it challenges the idea that only temperate phage insert their DNA into the host genome...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-eight coliphages {{were studied}} for their {{susceptibility}} to four systems of host control variation in Escherichia coli. Both temperate and <b>virulent</b> <b>phages</b> were studied, including phages with ribonucleic acid, double- and single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and glucosylated DNA. The systems examined were E. coli C-K, K-B, B-K, and K-K(P 1). The C-K, K-B, and B-K systems affected temperate phages and nonlysogenizing mutants derived from temperate phages. In general, these systems did not restrict <b>virulent</b> <b>phages.</b> Phage 21 e, {{a variant of}} phage 21, {{lost the ability to}} undergo restriction in the C-K and B-K systems, but retained susceptibility to the K-B and K-K(P 1) systems. This suggests that the genetic site(s) on the phage, {{as well as in the}} host, determines susceptibility to host-controlled variation. Both temperate and dependent <b>virulent</b> <b>phages</b> were susceptible to the host control system resulting from the presence of prophage P 1. The autonomous and small virulents were not susceptible. In a given system, the various susceptible phages differed widely in their efficiency of plating on the restricting host. If the few infections that occur arise in rare special cells, then different populations of special cells are available to different phage species. For most phage types, when a susceptible phage infected a nonrestricting host, the progeny showed the specificity appropriate to that host. Behavior of T 3 was exceptional, however. When T 3 obtained from E. coli K infected E. coli C or B, some of the progeny phages retained K host specificity, whereas others acquired the specificity of the new host...|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{presented}} that Group C bacteriophages differ as to their inactivating site on the streptococcal cell wall. While all three phages adsorb to isolated cell walls, only the C 1 phage was inactivated by enzymatically prepared group-specific carbohydrate. None of the Group C phages were inactivated by chemically extracted group-specific carbohydrate. In contrast, all virulent Group A streptococcal bacteriophages adsorbed only to living Group A streptococci. However, Group A temperate phages were able to adsorb to isolated cell walls but not to group-specific carbohydrate. While {{it has not been}} possible to identify the specific inactivating substance for the Group A <b>virulent</b> <b>phages,</b> certain pieces of evidence indirectly implicate the group-specific carbohydrate, specifically the N-acetylglucosamine moiety. The fact that Group A <b>virulent</b> <b>phages</b> failed to adsorb to heat-killed Group A streptococcal cells suggests that additional factors produced by the living cell are needed for complete viral inactivation...|$|R

50|$|The {{distinction}} between lysogenic and lytic cycles {{is that the}} spread of the viral DNA occurs through the usual prokaryotic reproduction, while the lytic phage is spread through the production of thousands of individual phages capable of surviving and infecting other cells. The key difference between the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle is that the lysogenic cycle does not lyse the host cell. Phages that replicate only via the lytic cycle are known as <b>virulent</b> <b>phages</b> while phages that replicate using both lytic and lysogenic cycles are known as temperate phages.|$|R

Bacteriol. 88 : 165 – 171. 1964. —Host range studies with five bacteriophages isolated from sewage {{showed that a}} high degree of strain specificity occurred among the species Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis var. zymogenes, and S. faecalis var. liquefaciens. Certain phages were able to attack various members of these subgroups but not other members. A high degree of strain specificity was also found with respect to eight phages attacking strains of S. faecium. Many strains of this latter group were resistant to all the phages available. The only firm conclusion was that no phage attacked both S. faecium and S. faecalis strains. In several selected strains of the S. faecalis-liquefaciens-zymogenes group, resistance to several <b>virulent</b> <b>phages</b> seemed {{to be related to the}} presence of certain prophages in these strains.

These highly concentrated bacterial populations are susceptible to <b>virulent</b> <b>phages</b> that are ubiquitous in cheese factories. In this study, the dissemination of these phages by the airborne route and their presence on working surfaces were investigated in a cheese factory.

40|$|For {{protection}} from the abnormal fermentation of Lactobacillus casei S- 1 caused by contamination of a <b>virulent</b> <b>phage,</b> φFSV, {{the origin of this}} phage was studied. Morphologies, viral structural proteins, and DNA structures of three independent isolates of φFSV were compared with those of φFSW, which is lysogenized in strain S- 1. The results showed (i) that the morphology of φFSV phages is indistinguishable from that of φFSW and (ii) that all viral structural components found in φFSW are present in the particles of φFSV's. In addition, restriction endonuclease analyses of viral DNA showed that the HindIII-digested fragments of φFSW DNA, the sum of which covered at least 94. 7 % of this phage genome, were conserved in the φFSV DNA digests. Results of Southern filter hybridization of the S- 1 and prophage-cured cell (C 239) DNAs with φFSV DNA as a probe revealed that C 239 had lost most of the φFSV DNA sequence, whereas S- 1 had about one copy of the φFSV DNA sequence. These results indicate that <b>virulent</b> <b>phage</b> φFSV is derived from the lysogenized phage φFSW.

The genomic sequence of this lactococcal phage contained 36, 798 bp with an overall G+C content of 35. 8 mol %. Fifty-nine open reading frames (ORFs) of more than 40 codons were found. N-terminal sequencing of phage structural proteins as well as bioinformatic analysis led to the attribution of a function to 24 ORFs (41 %). A lysogeny module was found within the genome of this <b>virulent</b> <b>phage.</b> The putative integrase gene {{seems to be the}} product of a horizontal transfer because it is more closely related to Streptococcus pyogenes phages than it is to L. lactis phages.

A dUTPase gene is the only conserved gene among all P 335 phages analyzed as well as the phage BK 5 -T. A genetic relationship between P 335 phages and the phage-type of the BK 5 -T species was established.

We investigated the frequency and characteristics of P. aeruginosa strain PAO 1 variants resisting infection by different combinations of <b>virulent</b> <b>phages</b> belonging to four genera. The frequency of resistant bacteria was 10 - 5 for single phage infection and 10 - 6 for infections with combinations of two or four phages.

The mutations affected genes involved in biosynthesis of type IV pilus, alginate, LPS and O-antigen. Half of the variants possessed changes in homopolymer tracts responsible for frameshift mutations, and these phase variation mutants were shown to be unstable. Eleven double mutants were detected.
