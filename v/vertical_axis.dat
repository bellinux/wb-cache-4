5|$|The Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker (ESL) is the world's first {{production}} full-range electrostatic loudspeaker, {{launched in}} 1957 by Quad Electroacoustics, {{then known as}} the Acoustical Manufacturing Co. Ltd. The speaker is shaped somewhat like a home electric radiator curved slightly on the <b>vertical</b> <b>axis.</b> They are widely admired for their clarity and precision, but known to be difficult speakers to run and maintain.|$|E
5|$|Air {{rises and}} rotates around a <b>vertical</b> <b>axis,</b> {{usually in the}} same {{direction}} as low-pressure systems in both northern and southern hemisphere. They are most often cyclonic, that is, associated with a localized low-pressure region within a supercell. Such storms can feature strong surface winds and severe hail. Mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in supercells, where tornadoes may form. About 1700 mesocyclones form annually across the United States, but only half produce tornadoes.|$|E

5|$|The façade, though {{built in}} the style of the Taj Mahal, lacks {{symmetry}} as the <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> has been given prominence which has resulted in an unbalanced appearance to the tomb. The dome is more elongated; the central part has a taller pishtaq. The four minarets at the four corners are part of the main mausoleum which was totally a different concept in elevation compared to the Taj Mahal where the towers are detached and away from the facade of the tomb.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{turbines}} are {{devices that}} convert the wind's kinetic energy into electrical power. The result of over a millennium of windmill development and modern engineering, today's wind turbines are manufactured {{in a wide}} range of horizontal axis and <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> types. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power. Slightly larger turbines can be used for making small contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid. Arrays of large turbines, known as wind farms, have become an increasingly important source of renewable energy and are used in many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the flat}} {{appearance}} of the loudspeaker, all three panels are slightly curved along the <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> to improve quality. The panels themselves are flat, but obtain their curvature by being slightly bent to a curved backing. With the bipolar nature of the speaker emitting sound from both front and back surfaces as it does, {{the application of a}} felt sheet {{to the rear of the}} panels damps and absorbs high frequencies radiating from the back. A crossover network, set at 500Hz, remains necessary to adjust for back-to-front interference causing loss in output at low frequencies. In addition, the speaker should stand in free space to achieve optimum sound. The instructions book contains advice against placement of the speaker in corners or positions close to or parallel with walls, and further explains that a corner placement will adversely affect bass response and be detrimental to the midrange because of standing waves generated.|$|E

5|$|The {{church is}} {{situated}} {{in the middle of}} the fortress' territory along the longitudinal axis. It belongs to the domed basilica type of churches, where the bearings join with the side-chapels of the apse. Two pairs of arches divided the longitudinal stretched prayer hall into three naves, the central one of which (with double side-chapels) on the eastern side ends with low staged, half-rounded apse and the side-chapels end with sacristies. They are characterized with stylish iconography, richness of theme and variety of different colors (where blue is dominant). The <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> of the building was crowned by a massive dome. The pointed dome with the cylindrical drum has not survived. It was damaged during Tamerlane's invasion and completely demolished in 1784 when the Avar Omar Khan invaded the Transcaucasus from Dagestan. In the 19th century, Viceroy of the Caucasus, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov built a semi-spherical wooden dome covered with iron sheets in place of the original dome. The dome was renovated during Soviet years.|$|E
25|$|Another type of <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> is the Parallel turbine, {{which is}} similar to the {{crossflow}} fan or centrifugal fan.

25|$|Rotor-powered {{vehicles}} are wind-powered vehicles that use rotors—instead of sails—which {{may have a}} shroud around them (ducted fan) or constitute an unducted propeller, and which may adjust orientation to face the apparent wind. The rotor may be connected via a drive train to wheels or to a generator that provides electrical power to electric motors that drive the wheels. Other concepts use a <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> wind turbine with airfoils that rotate around a <b>vertical</b> <b>axis.</b>|$|E

25|$|The eigenstates of spin {{about the}} <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> are not {{simultaneously}} eigenstates of spin about the horizontal axis, so this atom has equal probability of being {{found to have}} either value of spin about the horizontal axis. As described in the section above, measuring the spin about the horizontal axis can allow an atom which was spin up to become spin down: measuring its spin about the horizontal axis collapses its wave function {{into one of the}} eigenstates of this measurement, which means it is no longer in an eigenstate of spin about the <b>vertical</b> <b>axis,</b> so can take either value.|$|E

40|$|The {{computation}} of traveltimes in a transverse isotropic medium with a tilted {{symmetry axis}} tilted transversely isotropic {{is very important}} both for modelling and inversion. We develop a simple analytical procedure to map the traveltime function from a transverse isotropic medium with a <b>vertical</b> symmetry <b>axis</b> (<b>vertical</b> transversely isotropic) to a tilted transversely isotropic medium by applying point-by-point mapping of the traveltime function.

25|$|Wind {{turbines}} can rotate {{about either}} a horizontal or a <b>vertical</b> <b>axis,</b> the former being both {{older and more}} common. They can also include blades (transparent or not) or be bladeless. Vertical designs produce less power and are less common.|$|E
25|$|Many {{amusement}} rides provide rotation. A Ferris wheel has {{a horizontal}} central axis, and parallel axes for each gondola, where the rotation is opposite, by gravity or mechanically. As a result, {{at any time}} {{the orientation of the}} gondola is upright (not rotated), just translated. The tip of the translation vector describes a circle. A carousel provides rotation about a <b>vertical</b> <b>axis.</b> Many rides provide a combination of rotations about several axes. In Chair-O-Planes the rotation about the <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> is provided mechanically, while the rotation about the horizontal axis is due to the centripetal force. In roller coaster inversions the rotation about the horizontal axis is one or more full cycles, where inertia keeps people in their seats.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusion}} of domes, however, represents a wider {{sense of the}} word vault. The distinction between the two is that a vault is essentially an arch which is extruded into the third dimension, whereas a dome is an arch revolved around its <b>vertical</b> <b>axis.</b>|$|E

50|$|The axis of {{rotation}} for <b>vertical</b> single <b>axis</b> trackers is <b>vertical</b> {{with respect to the}} ground. These trackers rotate from East to West {{over the course of the}} day. Such trackers are more effective at high latitudes than are horizontal axis trackers. Field layouts must consider shading to avoid unnecessary energy losses and to optimize land utilization. Also optimization for dense packing is limited due to the nature of the shading over the course of a year. <b>Vertical</b> single <b>axis</b> trackers typically have the face of the module oriented at an angle with respect to the axis {{of rotation}}. As a module tracks, it sweeps a cone that is rotationally symmetric around the {{axis of rotation}}.|$|R
