40|$|Passenger vehicle {{crashworthiness}} {{is one of}} {{the essential}} vehicle attributes. According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there were over six million vehicle crashes in the United States in the year 2000, which claimed the lives of more than forty thousand persons. Vehicle crashworthiness is difficult to satisfy in a manner appeasing to other design decisions about the vehicle. This paper aims at developing a novel methodology for crashworthiness optimization of <b>vehicle</b> <b>structures.</b> Based on observations of the manner of structural deformation, the authors propose the abstraction of the actual <b>vehicle</b> <b>structure,</b> which is to be represented as a linkage mechanism having special nonlinear springs at the joints. The special springs are chosen to allow the motion of the mechanism to capture the overall motion of the actual <b>vehicle</b> <b>structure.</b> It thus becomes possible to optimize the mechanism, which is an easier task than directly optimizing the <b>vehicle</b> <b>structure.</b> A realization of the optimized mechanism is then performed to obtain an equivalent structure, and then direct optimization of the realized structure is performed for further tuning. The study presented shows the success of the proposed approach in finding better designs than direct optimization while using comparatively less computational resources...|$|R

The cavity, {{formed at}} the nose part of {{underwater}} launched vehicle {{due to the}} high launching velocity, will collapse while crossing water free surface and has {{a great impact on}} the strength of <b>vehicle</b> <b>structure.</b> In order to study the effect of the cavity collapse to <b>vehicle</b> <b>structure,</b> water exit dynamic analysis has been conducted.

And the flight <b>vehicle</b> <b>structure</b> is simplified into a free-free Timoshenko beam. The Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) effect is treated as added mass and hydrodynamic drag force varying with wet surface area, which decreases with the water exit of vehicle.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the design of <b>vehicle</b> <b>structures</b> through the use of Fatigue Equivalent Static Loads (FESL). A large percentage of failures of mechanical structures can be attributed to fatigue. Furthermore, it is also generally accepted that defective structural design is mostly caused by insufficient knowledge of the input loading. The fatigue loads experienced by <b>vehicle</b> <b>structures</b> are especially difficult to quantify. In the current competitive markets, it is essential to use a pro-active, timely and cost effective process to solve fatigue related problems. The heart of the FESL methodology is the ability to condense a large amount of input load data into a single fatigue load. This is achieved by calculating the damage of the measurements and converting it to an equivalent stress, {{through the use of a}} calibration matrix obtained from a unit-load finite element analysis. A Fatigue Equivalent Static Load can now be determined, and the <b>vehicle</b> <b>structure</b> can be evaluated for durability.

40|$|The thermal {{unfolding}} {{behaviors of}} N-carbamyl-D-amino acid amidohydrolase (DCase) were investigated by 1 ns molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water with temperature jump technique. Rather than a symmetrical event, {{the unfolding of}} the two subunits of the dimeric DCase follows different pathways. Subunit A loses its secondary <b>structure</b> <b>integrity</b> from the outermost layer 1 to the innermost layer 4, whereas subunit B unfolds first from its interior layer 3, where the active site pocket is located. Hence, the active site from subunit B is less stable than that from subunit A. Furthermore, the interfacial hydrophobic region is expanded, implying that the dimeric DCase tends to dissociate into the enzymatically inactive monomeric form. It further indicates that the interior layers lose their secondary <b>structure</b> <b>integrity,</b> resulting in destruction of the active site geometry. Thus, it is recommended to construct several disulfide bonds in the interfacial hydrophobic region to “lock” these two subunits {{in order to maintain}} its enzymatically active dimeric form...|$|R

The proposed methodology is based on the principle of the Pareto front and multiobjective optimization. The methodology enables the designer to evaluate the crashworthiness performance of any suggested design easily and effectively. Moreover, the methodology provides different optimum designs from which the designer can easily select the optimum design variables to improve the performance of the initial design. In the third part, the crashworthiness behavior of simple thin walled <b>structures</b> and <b>vehicle</b> structural components made of magnesium due to its light weight is examined and a new methodology for material design optimization is presented. The proposed methodology adds material type as design variables to formal size design variables.

Different imperfection configurations are proposed to improve the crashworthiness performance of crush elements. The genetic algorithm is directly combined with nonlinear finite elements models to search for optimum imperfection values. The results show that the crashworthiness performance of crush elements can be greatly improved through introduction of proper imperfection.

40|$|To {{respond to}} the advent of more lethal threats, {{recently}} designed aluminum-armor-based military-vehicle systems have resorted to an increasing use of higher strength aluminum alloys (with superior ballistic resistance against armor piercing (AP) threats and with high vehicle-light weighing potential). Unfortu-nately, these alloys are not very amenable to conventional fusion-based welding technologies and in-order to obtain high-quality welds, solid-state joining technologies such as Friction stir welding (FSW) have to be employed. However, since FSW {{is a relatively new}} and fairly complex joining technology, its introduction into advanced military <b>vehicle</b> <b>structures</b> is not straight forward and entails a comprehensive multi-step approach. One such (three-step) approach is developed in the present work. Within the first step, experi-mental and computational techniques are utilized to determine the optimal tool design and the optimal FSW process parameters which result in maximal productivity of the joining process and the highest quality of the weld. Within the second step, techniques are developed for the identification and qualification of the optimal weld joint designs in different sections of a prototypical military <b>vehicle</b> <b>structure.</b> In the third step, problems associated with the fabrication of a sub-scale military <b>vehicle</b> test <b>structure</b> and the blast survivability of the structure are assessed.
