5|$|As a {{technology}} showcase, Valve considered Lost Coast to have <b>very</b> <b>demanding</b> system requirements. The game runs on computers with specifications lower {{than what is}} recommended, albeit without some key features such as high dynamic range. If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, the developer commentary is changed slightly to reflect this. For example, Valve president Gabe Newell would describe the effects that are seen in a different manner.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian Forest cats have a {{quiet voice}} but can develop a loud voice if kept {{in a house with}} a dog. They are friendly, intelligent, and {{generally}} good with people. The Norwegian Forest cat has a lot of energy and can be <b>very</b> <b>demanding</b> of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life. If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800. The cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old. As they are heavy-boned and tall, they require more food than most other domestic breeds. Males are considerably heavier and larger-boned than females.|$|E

5|$|Maxwell {{left the}} Academy in 1847 at age 16 and began {{attending}} {{classes at the}} University of Edinburgh. He {{had the opportunity to}} attend the University of Cambridge, but decided, after his first term, to complete the full course of his undergraduate studies at Edinburgh. The academic staff of Edinburgh University included some highly regarded names; his first year tutors included Sir William Hamilton, who lectured him on logic and metaphysics, Philip Kelland on mathematics, and James Forbes on natural philosophy. He did not find his classes at Edinburgh University <b>very</b> <b>demanding,</b> and was therefore able to immerse himself in private study during free time at the university and particularly when back home at Glenlair. There he would experiment with improvised chemical, electric, and magnetic apparatus, but his chief concerns regarded the properties of polarised light. He constructed shaped blocks of gelatine, subjected them to various stresses, and with a pair of polarising prisms given to him by William Nicol, viewed the coloured fringes that had developed within the jelly. Through this practice he discovered photoelasticity, which is a means of determining the stress distribution within physical structures.|$|E

Erika seems fascinated with the past and the liberation of the female voice while Hilde is engrossed with silencing herself and moving forward.|$|E

Premier Institutes have been criticised for lack of hygienic food supply to resident doctors and their shabby living conditions.|$|E

25|$|Overall {{development}} of the Il-86 occupied over a decade. The length of this period {{was due to the}} sensitivity of the airliner's configuration, problems with its powerplant, prolonged avionics development and the low priority of civil as opposed to military aircraft. In its earlier stages, the Il-86 programme was also held back by hopes of US airliner imports. Certificating the Il-86 to the <b>very</b> <b>demanding</b> set of Soviet and Comecon standards called NLGS-2 also delayed progress; it was the first Soviet aircraft to undergo a full certification programme since certification was introduced in the USSR in 1967 and became mandatory five years later.|$|E
25|$|The Army was reconstructed {{after the}} War, based among {{others on the}} forces {{established}} in exile in Sweden and Great Britain during the War, {{as well as on}} domestic forces. The participation in the allied occupation of Germany was a <b>very</b> <b>demanding</b> task for the Army in the period of 1946–52, {{but it was also a}} part of the reconstruction. The Army was established in all parts of the country, with a significant stronghold in Troms based on the threat picture of that time: the fear of an invasion from the East. This picture definitely changed with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent break-up of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.|$|E
25|$|When push-points are absent, {{but there}} is not enough space to use sidewinding because of lateral constraints, such as in tunnels, snakes rely on {{concertina}} locomotion. In this mode, the snake braces the posterior portion of its body against the tunnel wall while the front of the snake extends and straightens. The front portion then flexes and forms an anchor point, and the posterior is straightened and pulled forwards. This mode of locomotion is slow and <b>very</b> <b>demanding,</b> up to seven times the cost of laterally undulating over the same distance. This high cost is due to the repeated stops and starts of portions of the body as well as the necessity of using active muscular effort to brace against the tunnel walls.|$|E

Because of his tall and imposing stature, he often appeared as a policeman or a soldier. His most famous roles were the father's victim in The Common Man (1975), Captain Dumont in the series Now Where Did the 7th Company Get to? (1973) and commissioner Florimond Faroux in the series Nestor Burma.|$|R
25|$|All {{thermodynamic}} cycles require large temperature differentials for efficient operation. In {{an external}} combustion engine, the heater temperature always equals or exceeds the expansion temperature. This {{means that the}} metallurgical requirements for the heater material are <b>very</b> <b>demanding.</b> This {{is similar to a}} Gas turbine, but is in contrast to an Otto engine or Diesel engine, where the expansion temperature can far exceed the metallurgical limit of the engine materials, because the input heat source is not conducted through the engine, so engine materials operate closer to the average temperature of the working gas. The Stirling cycle is not actually achievable, the real cycle in Stirling machines is less efficient than the theoretical Stirling cycle, also the efficiency of the Stirling cycle is lower where the ambient temperatures are mild, while it would give its best results in a cool environment, such as northern countries' winters.|$|E
25|$|In this role, due {{to their}} working heritage, Border Collies are <b>very</b> <b>demanding,</b> playful, and energetic. They thrive best in {{households}} that can provide them with plenty of play and exercise, either with humans or other dogs. Due to their demanding personalities and need for mental stimulation and exercise, many Border Collies develop problematic behaviours in households that {{are not able to}} provide for their needs. They are infamous for chewing holes in walls, furniture such as chairs and table legs, destructive scraping and hole digging, due to boredom. Border Collies may exhibit a strong desire to herd, a trait they may show with small children, cats, and other dogs. The breed's herding trait has been deliberately encouraged, {{as it was in the}} dogs from which the Border Collie was developed, by selective breeding for many generations. However, being eminently trainable, they can live amicably with other pets if given proper socialisation training.|$|E
25|$|Octavian {{offered an}} early amnesty to his opponents and Horace quickly {{accepted}} it. On returning to Italy, he {{was confronted with}} yet another loss: his father's estate in Venusia {{was one of many}} throughout Italy to be confiscated for the settlement of veterans (Virgil lost his estate in the north about the same time). Horace later claimed that he was reduced to poverty and this led him to try his hand at poetry. In reality, there was no money to be had from versifying. At best, it offered future prospects through contacts with other poets and their patrons among the rich. Meanwhile, he obtained the sinecure of scriba quaestorius, a civil service position at the aerarium or Treasury, profitable enough to be purchased even by members of the ordo equester and not <b>very</b> <b>demanding</b> in its work-load, since tasks could be delegated to scribae or permanent clerks.
