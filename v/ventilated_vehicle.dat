40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a management representative at a government agency. The requestor was concerned about potential employee exposures to erionite mineral fibers when employees maintained dirt roads in areas where erionite has been confirmed or is suspected to be present [USGS 1996]. We visited two field offices to assess potential employee exposures to erionite and respirable crystalline silica during road maintenance activities in October 2012 and August 2013. We sent summary letters with preliminary recommendations in October 2012, January 2013, and March 2014. We took air samples for mineral fibers and respirable crystalline silica on employees who repaired dirt roads and analyzed rock samples. Some employees had silica exposures above occupational exposure limits. We did not find erionite in the air or bulk rock/soil samples. We recommended that the employer not use aggregate that contains erionite to repair roads and that they control dust exposures with <b>ventilated</b> <b>vehicle</b> cabs, wet methods, and other work practices.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{need for}} {{management}} of tunnel air quality is imminent considering the rapid increase of number and span of tunnels in Korea. To investigate {{spatial distribution of}} CO 2 within tunnels, CO 2 were measured and model simulations were performed in Namsan 1 tunnel. Results show that CO 2 concentrations were 250 ppm to 400 ppm higher in the exit than tunnel entrance. Also, CO 2 concentrations were 200 ppm to 300 ppm lower inside no <b>ventilating</b> <b>vehicle</b> than in the tunnel. Both experimental and model simulation results show that spatial distribution and concentration gradient of air pollutant inside tunnel are highly dependent on traffic density...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} scheme {{based on}} the homogeneous multiphase model was proposed to model the ventilated cavitating flow by considering interaction between three phases including vapor, ventilated gas and liquid. Due {{to the difficulty of}} carrying out ventilated cavitation experiments in high-speed water tunnels, focus was put on predicting the developing process of the cavitating flow with high Froude number. The evolution processes for the ventilated cavity which transited between different gas-leakage mechanisms were successfully captured, obtaining the variation of the cavitation number along with the ventilation rate. Hydrodynamics analysis was carried out for the cavitating body with low and high Froude number respectively, thereby revealing the ventilation rate to optimize the vehicle performance. Based on the numerical results, a theoretical gas-leakage model which was adapted {{to a wide range of}} Froude number and various gas-leakage mechanisms was proposed. The model was validated through comparison against experimental data and numerical results. This research provides valuable guidance on the design for <b>ventilated</b> cavitating <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study on the}} drag reduction mechanism created by a ventilated partial cavity and its associated effects by the downstream dispersed microbubbles. A semi-empirical approach is introduced to model the discrete interface of the ventilated cavity and its complex gas leakage rate induced by the local turbulent shear stress. Based on the Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid modeling framework, a population balance approach based on MUltiple-SIze-Group (MUSIG) model is incorporated to simulate the dynamical effects of bubbly flow along the test body. Particular attention is also directed to grasp {{a better understanding of}} the size evolution of microbubble and its associated effects on drag reduction. Model predictions are validated against three experimental measurements carried out in a high-speed water tunnel by Schauer (2003) and Wosnik et al. (2005). Close examination of the flow structures, gas void fraction distributions and its resultant density ratio provides valuable insights on the complex physical phenomenon, helping to consolidate idea to maximize the drag reduction for <b>ventilated</b> cavitating <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} self noise from a <b>ventilated</b> {{supercavitating}} <b>vehicle.</b> A <b>ventilated</b> supercavity is a gaseous envelope surrounding an underwater vehicle that significantly reduces the drag {{felt by the}} vehicle. But the hydrodynamic noise generated by {{the creation of the}} supercavity could impact the successful deployment of the vehicle. A principal source of self noise for these types of vehicles is sound created by the ventilating gas jets impinging on the air-water interface. Analytical models of the radiated sound through the interface have been developed. Sometimes jets impinging on the interface entrain bubbles beneath the surface. This thesis outlines a theory to predict the influence of bubbles near the interface. Experimental measurements were made at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) in Newport, RI to test the accuracy of the model. These measurements include the unsteady force spectrum of a gas jet impinging on a rigid wall. The acoustic pressure spectrum of a gas jet striking the air-water interface was also recorded. The experimental results were compared to theoretical models for validation...|$|R
40|$|Investigations were {{performed}} to identify the thermal environment in three different types of broiler transport vehicles {{from the site of}} production to processing plants in Sweden and Denmark. Vehicles with mechanical ventilation systems (F-vehicles) had pressure fans in combination with adjustable openings in front, sides and back. F-vehicles were winter configured by turning the fans off and increasing the natural ventilation (FN-vehicles). The naturally <b>ventilated</b> <b>vehicles</b> (N-vehicles) had adjustable openings in front, back and sides of the vehicle. Tarpaulin vehicles (K-vehicles) were Danish vehicles constructed with solid roof and front, and detachable tarpaulin sides for summer and winter configurations. All broilers were mechanically harvested. Long term investigations {{were performed}} on transport documentations from 2, 310 Swedish vehicles during Oct. 2005 to Oct. 2006 (F- and FN-vehicles) and Apr. 2006 - Oct. 2006 (N-vehicles). The number of broilers dead on arrival (DOA) was 0. 14 % and 0. 39 % for F- and N-vehicles, respectively. Transport time up to 3. 5 h, ambient- and lorry temperature had no effects on DOA (R 2 = 0, 013), however a small increase was seen at ambient temperatures above 17 ºC (NS). Intensive studies of twenty three transports were performed during Jun. – Aug. 2006 and Dec. 2006 – Feb. 2007, where levels of temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide (CO 2) in containers at different locations of the vehicles were measured during loading and transit. Loading practise had an impact on temperature development in the F-vehicle and to reduce heat stress they should be loaded back to front. Keeping both sides of the vehicle open during loading was important to avoid increasing temperatures in the containers. In F-vehicles with fans turned off the internal climate becomes unstable, especially in the trailer. In N-vehicles during summer temperatures were high, exceeding 25 °C in the lower, central parts of the trailer. In these certain parts of the vehicle air flow needs to be increased. During transport large internal climatic differences were found between containers in both F- and N-vehicle. A calculated temperature-humidity index (THI) was at acute dangerous levels in certain containers. In N-vehicles the drawers’ construction was limiting ventilation. K-vehicles had the most acceptable climate during summer, but unstable during winter with risk for temperatures down to 0 °C. In conclusion, the ventilation system designs in the vehicles are crucial for appropriate climate control and are in several cases in need of revising or reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|The National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a U. S. Department of Energy {{national}} laboratory, is {{collaborating with}} U. S. automotive manufacturers to develop innovative techniques to reduce national fuel consumption and vehicle tailpipe emissions by reducing vehicle climate control loads. A new U. S. emissions test, the Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (SFTP), will soon begin measuring tailpipe emissions {{with the air}} conditioning system operating. Modeled results show that emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) more than double during the air conditioning part of the SFTP. Reducing the transmittance of the glazing can have {{a greater impact on}} the cabin soak temperature than <b>ventilating</b> the <b>vehicle</b> during a hot soak. Reducing the amount of outside air can decrease cooling and heating loads but requires that the recirculated air be cleaned. We discuss a photocatalytic oxidation air-cleaning process for removing volatile organic compounds and bioareosols. We conclude with an example of modeling the thermal comfort of the occupants. An auxiliary load increase of only 400 Watts (W) results in a 0. 4 km/L (1 mpg) decrease for a conventional 11. 9 -L/ 100 -km (28 -mpg) vehicle. If every vehicle in the United States were to save only 0. 4 km/L (1 mpg), $ 4 billion (U. S. dollars) would be saved annually in gasoline and oil costs.

40|$|By <b>ventilating</b> the <b>vehicle’s</b> {{interior}} {{during a}} soak, the peak cooling load is reduced {{and therefore the}} air-conditioning needs less power. This in turn translates to a smaller air-conditioning unit which would consume less power, be lighter and more compact. This solar driven ventilation of the vehicle’s interior during a soak is defined as precooling. During this project the best precooling strategy for passenger vehicles was found by investigating and testing different precooling strategies and evaluating them according to their thermodynamic performance, their potential implementation and their influence on the required cooling performance of the airconditioning cycle. The best performances were achieved by strategies with a high air flow rate and a relatively low air inlet temperature. Two categories of precooling strategies were examined: natural convection and forced convection strategies. Openings in the vehicle’s body that fit to all strategies had to be found; with a big potential concerning their thermodynamic performance and other aspects like prevention against water penetration. The best investigated precooling strategies {{proved to be the}} one which used the design outlet as an inlet and the opening of the HVAC as an outlet. With these openings a good air flow through the whole cabin can be guaranteed. In addition to that the strategy only uses existing openings of the body which prevent against water penetration. The required installation space for this strategy already exists and can be considered for the package of next generation vehicle...|$|R

Starting with the lightweight base model GTU, which came with manual windows, no rear wiper, the sunroof and A/C was dealer optioned, the GTUs added items found on the Turbo model such as four piston front brakes, rear <b>ventilated</b> brake rotors, <b>vehicle</b> speed sensing power steering, one-piece front chin spoiler, cloth covered Turbo model seats, leather wrapped steering wheel, 16 inch wheels, 205/55VR tires, and a GTUs-only 4.300 Viscous-type limited slip differential (all other FC LSD's were 4.100). This allowed quicker acceleration from the non-turbo powered 13B. Mazda built 1100 GTUs in 1989, with the last 100 re-stamped as 1990 models.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{was to assess the}} risks {{involved}} in the transportation of personal oxygen bottles and to determine ways to reduce these risks. Oxygen tanks are prescribed to individuals whose lungs cannot solely supply enough oxygen. These individuals may have conditions such as Emphysema, Sarcoidosis, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and other heart and lung diseases. Transportation of oxidizing gases poses many safety risks since they can explode and cause fires. There are standards set by the U. S. Department of Transportation, the Compressed Gas Association, and others on the containment, storage, and handling of the compressed oxygen gas and liquid oxygen but there are no regulations regarding how these personal oxygen bottles must be secured during transportation in vehicles. To aid in determining the risks involved with transporting oxygen, a questionnaire was developed and distributed to potential clients, current standards were investigated, and accident statistics were analyzed. Analysis of the responses was used in conjunction with the established risks to assess the severity and likelihood of hazard occurrence. The major hazards were determined to be an oxygen-enriched environment, combustion, and the transformation of the bottle into a projectile {{in the case of an}} accident. Suggested regulations to minimize these risks were to secure the bottle vertically around the center of mass of the bottle with a restraint, <b>ventilate</b> the <b>vehicle</b> properly, and prohibit smoking in the vehicle. Implementation of these safety standards would reduce the risk of injury to an individual during the transportation of a personal portable oxygen bottle...|$|R
40|$|The {{harsh winter}} {{conditions}} on the Canadian prairies impose special challenges in providing acceptable environmental conditions for broiler chickens during transportation. A research program was developed aiming to improve the transport conditions for broilers. As part of the research program, a research project was developed to design and construct an experimental trailer equipped with active ventilation and heating, to characterize {{the performance of the}} experimental trailer in field tests under Canadian Prairie winter conditions, to develop, calibrate and validate CFD models used for simulating the environmental conditions found inside the experimental trailer, and to utilize one of the CFD models to predict the performance of the experimental trailer when subjected to different operational conditions. This dissertation consists of six chapters. The first introductory chapter reviews economical, logistical and legislative aspects surrounding the poultry transport industry. This chapter also includes a discussion of important parameters for the design of an experimental transport system, a review of fundamental concepts of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling method, and why CFD was chosen as a tool to complement the experimental work in this project. The second chapter reviews the designs of commercial poultry transport equipment and how they inspired the design of an actively heated and <b>ventilated</b> experimental <b>vehicle.</b> The setup of the experimental trailer was also discussed in detail. The third chapter reviews the experimental protocol used to evaluate the performance of the experimental trailer. The performance of this experimental trailer was evaluated in a series of field tests conducted under commercial loading operations, in winter {{conditions on the}} Canadian Prairies. It was found that the average load temperature varied from 7. 1 to 15. 6 °C in the nine sts of data. The system was able to maintain an environment above 1 °C. As for the humidity level inside the trailer, the majority of sensors had representative relative humidity (RH*) values between 10 and 40 %, with the rest having RH* values below saturation. The fourth chapter reviews the development, calibration and validation of the 3 -D CFD models developed to simulate the environmental conditions inside the experimental trailer. A total of three CFD models were developed to simulate the three different ventilation regimes encountered in field tests. Sensitivity studies revealed that inlet velocities, heat and moisture production had a great impact on the results obtained from the CFD models. The levels of porosity investigated did not play a significant role. The standard error of estimate was selected as a statistical measure to evaluate the accuracy of the CFD models against experimental data. For temperature data, its standard error of estimate varied from 3. 2 to 7. 3 °C. For humidity ratio, its standard error of estimate varied from 1. 7 to 5. 0 g of water vapour per kg of dry air. The CFD models were able to recreate the temperature trends as observed from experimental data. It was concluded that these CFD models have adequate accuracy {{to be used as a}} design tool for comparative studies. The fifth chapter investigates the use of the 1 -fan CFD model to study several scenarios. Three cases were investigated, based on conditions which may be encountered by the poultry transport industry. The first case examined the effects of vehicle travel speed and ambient temperature. The second case looked at the effects of bird size, loading density and ambient temperature. The last case studied the effects of side tarp insulation and ambient temperature. For the range of values examined, results from the simulations concluded that ambient temperature, bird sizes, loading density and side tarp insulation value were important factors to consider in the design of an actively <b>ventilated</b> poultry transport <b>vehicle.</b> The last chapter of this dissertation summarizes the main findings in this research project, discussed future work and presented final conclusions. Overall, this research project answered two key questions in the poultry transport research program. Firstly, the experimental work proved that the concept of active ventilation and heating is a promising option to improve the transport conditions for broiler chickens during cold ambient conditions. Secondly, the CFD work demonstrated that CFD modeling is a valuable tool for designing the next generation of actively <b>ventilated</b> poultry transport <b>vehicle...</b>|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies were}} {{designed}} to investigate effect of cold winter transportation on broiler meat quality and physiological parameters. The first study assessed the effect of microclimate environment during winter transportation (- 27 to + 11 ºC) from farm to the processing plant (3 - 4 h) on core body temperature (CBT) and breast meat quality parameters of 522 broiler chickens using an actively <b>ventilated</b> transport <b>vehicle.</b> Temperatures below freezing during transportation resulted in significantly (P 6. 1; L*< 46). The effects of extreme cold conditions (- 18 to - 4 ºC) along with age (5 and 6 wk), gender and lairage (0 and 2 h) on physiology parameters, breast muscle metabolites and meat quality of 360 birds using a simulated transport system were investigated. Five and 6 wk birds exposed to temperatures below - 8 and - 14 ºC, respectively, showed significantly (P 50 %) was observed for 5 and 6 wk birds exposed to temperatures below - 8 and - 14 ºC respectively. Lairage following acute cold exposure caused an increase of up to 20 % in DFD breast meat following exposure of the birds to temperatures below - 8 ºC. Characteristics of cold-induced DFD breast meat were investigated in broiler chickens. DFD breast meat was significantly darker, redder, and less yellow in color and had higher pH, water binding capacity, processing cook yield and lower thaw and cook loss compared to normal meat. However, {{no significant difference in}} initial energy reserves was observed between DFD and normal breast meat. Effect of extreme cold-stress (- 15 to - 9 ºC) was further assessed on thigh meat quality and incidence of DFD from 160 male broilers. A greater impact of cold stress was observed on muscle metabolites and pH of thigh compared to breast meat, with 85 % DFD incidence in thigh compared to 42 % in breast meat of cold-stressed birds. Biochemical basis of cold-induced DFD breast and thigh meat was investigated by measuring muscle metabolites at different times post-mortem. Lack of energy reserves at slaughter clearly explained the incidence of DFD thigh meat, but other factors might contribute to DFD breast meat aside from glycogen reserve at slaughter. However, the factors leading to DFD breast meat still remain unresolved and association of post-mortem enzyme activity and development of DFD breast meat merits further investigation...|$|R
