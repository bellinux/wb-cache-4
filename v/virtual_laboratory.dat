The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory's director, Arthur B. McDonald, {{is a member}} of the university's physics department. The observatory managed the SNO experiment, which demonstrated that the solution to the solar neutrino problem was that neutrinos change flavour (type) as they propagate through the Sun. The SNO experiment proved that a non-zero mass neutrino exists. This was a major breakthrough in cosmology. In October 2015, Arthur B. McDonald and Takaaki Kajita (University of Tokyo) jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physics for illustration of neutrino change identities and identification of mass. This is the first Nobel Prize awarded to a Queen's University researcher. In 1976 urologist Alvaro Morales, along with his colleagues, developed the first clinically effective immunotherapy for cancer by adapting the Bacille Calmette-Guérin tuberculosis vaccine for treatment of early stage bladder cancer.|$|E

25|$|There soon {{followed}} a period playing in Copenhagen, Denmark which McGregor {{identified as a}} turning point in their musical approach. They returned to London and were subsequently to be found playing almost exclusively at The Old Place in Gerrard Street, the former home of Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club which had recently been transformed into a <b>virtual</b> <b>laboratory</b> for the emerging British avant garde jazz scene. Because of this, they are still considered a seminal influence on the new generation of British jazz musicians coming through in the late 1960s. Artists such as Keith Tippett, Evan Parker, John Stevens and John Surman have long hailed them as true pioneers and a massive influence. However, by late 1965 the group was also beginning to fragment. Feza returned to Copenhagen, while Dyani and Moholo went on a South American tour with the soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy – subsequently recording the album The Forest and the Zoo for the ESP-Disk label. Meanwhile, Moyake had decided to return to South Africa permanently even before their arrival in the UK.|$|E

With the introduction of Cloud Computing technologies more and more laboratories move into the cloud, known as <b>virtual</b> <b>laboratories.</b> While there are many benefits for using <b>virtual</b> <b>laboratories,</b> there is also an increase complexity regarding the usage of them. There are many cloud management systems (Cloud MS) which add an extra layer of complexity to the e-learning experience both from the perspective of the teacher and of the student. The purpose of the study is to identify ways to improve the learning process through the use of cloud computing technologies, while reducing the complexity associated with these technologies the main focus is about the requesting, creation, deployment, monitoring and management of <b>virtual</b> <b>laboratories</b> using Cloud Computing. IBM Tivoli Service Automation Manager and VMware Hypervisor are used for building a private cloud. Moodle is used as the Course Management System (Course MS). The proposed <b>Virtual</b> <b>Laboratories</b> Cloud System (VLCS) offers one possible way to improve the learning process by using Cloud Computing to offer <b>Virtual</b> <b>Laboratories</b> as a Service (VLaaS).

50|$|In 1997, {{the first}} version of the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Laboratory</b> was presented, titled <b>Virtual</b> <b>Laboratory</b> of Physiology. At this time, the main focus lay on the {{development}} of technological preconditions of physiological research in the 19th century. Therefore, a database with relevant texts and images was created. In 1998, the concept still used today was created after a series of modifications, followed by the publication of a cd-ROM in 1999. At this time, the focus had been expanded from physiology to the life sciences in general, as well as the arts and literature. As the project had been extended from a sole database to a platform for historiographical research, it was presented at the conference Using the World Wide Web for Historical Research in Science and Technology organized by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation at Stanford University. In 2000, the project was incorporated into the research project The Experimentalization of Life, funded by the Volkswagen Foundation.
