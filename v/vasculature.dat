In the adult subgranular zone (SGZ), dense clusters of dividing cells were found to be anatomically close to the <b>vasculature,</b> especially capillaries. Contacts between adult SVZ neuronal precursors and blood vessels are unusually permeable and frequently devoid of astrocyte and pericyte interferences, suggesting that blood-derived cues are gaining direct access to adult neural precursors and their progeny. The <b>vasculature</b> also provides the substrate for new neuron migration after injury in the adult striatum.|$|E
5|$|In {{other parts}} of the body, {{circulation}} in the lymphatic <b>vasculature</b> clears extracellular waste products from the cell tissue. For the tissue of the brain, such a system has not yet been identified. However, the presence of a glymphatic pathway has been proposed.

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{investigate}} the role of calmodulin in the adrenergic transmission of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) -salt hyper-tension. In perfused mesenteric <b>vasculatures</b> prepared from DOCA-salt hypertensive rats (seven to eight weeks after operation) and age-matched normotensive control rats, {{the effects of a}} specific calmodulin antagonist (W- 7 : N-(6 -aminohexyl) - 5 -chloro-l-naphthalenesulfonamide) on the norepi-nephrine release and vascular responsiveness were examined. Endogenous norepinephrine overflow during electrical nerve stimulation was significantly greater in the mesenteric <b>vasculatures</b> of DOCA-salt hypertensive rats both at low (5 Hz) and high (15 Hz) frequencies than in those of the normoten-sive controls. Vasoconstrictor responses to electrical nerve stimulation or exogenous norepinephrine were also enhanced in the DOCA-salt hypertension compared to those in the controls. The calmodulin antagonist (W- 7) inhibited the stimulation-evoked norepinephrine overflow and pressor responses in a dose-dependent manner. The suppressive magni-tudes in these responses by W- 7 were significantly greater in the mesenteric <b>vasculatures</b> of the DOCA-salt hypertension than in those of the control rats. These results demonstrate that the vascular adrenergic neurotransmission might be enhanced in the mesenteric <b>vasculatures</b> of the DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Further, it is suggested that the marked reduction in stimulation-evoked norepi-nephrine overflow and vasoconstrictor responses by W- 7 showed the greater calmodulin-dependent regulation in the vascular adrenergic activity of DOCA-salt hypertension.

40|$|Background: A {{great number}} of in vitro and in vivo studies have {{suggested}} that many pathways or factors can stimulate angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, which facilitate tumor progression and metastasis. However, the morphological and immunohistochemical profile of newly formed <b>vasculatures</b> has not been elucidated, making it difficult to differentiate them from the pre-existing ones, and to identify their unique molecular profiles for diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. Experimental findings: As cytokeratin (CK) - 19 is a well-recognized stem cell marker and CK- 19 -positive cells are frequently detected in the peripheral blood of patients with metastatic cancer, our recent studies have assessed the involvement of CK- 19 in the formation of new <b>vasculatures</b> in primary colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues. Our studies showed that a subset of lymph node-positive cases harbored some isolated normal epithelial structures with distinct CK- 19 immunostaining within an otherwise CK- 19 -negative background. These structures are exclusively located within or adjacent to lymphoid follicles and are often surrounded by tube-like structures expressing lymphatic endothelial marker D 2 - 40. Similar structures are more frequently seen at the junctions between pre-invasive and invasive CRC with the following features: (1). they consist of a single layer of endothelial cells that express both D 2 - 40 and CD 34, (2). their endothelial walls are often incomplete with disseminated cells protruding into the adjacent stroma, and (3). they are exclusively associated with disseminated CK- 19 -positive cells Hypothesis: Based on these findings, we propose that these tube-like structures represent newly formed <b>vasculatures,</b> which are derived by the convergence of aberrant lymphocyte infiltration and tumor stem cells. Because of their close physical proximity, tumor stem cells within the epithelial and stromal components contribute equally and coordinately to the morphogenesis of new <b>vasculatures,</b> which constitutes the basis for the unique morphologic and immunohistochemical features of newly formed <b>vasculatures.</b> Our hypothesis appears to be applicable to all epithelium-derived cancers. </p...|$|R
40|$|Computer-aided {{analysis}} of venous <b>vasculatures</b> including hepatic veins and portal veins {{is important in}} liver surgery planning. The analysis normally consists of two important pre-processing tasks: segmenting both <b>vasculatures</b> and separating them from each other by assigning different labels. During the acquisition of multi-phase CT images, both of the venous vessels are enhanced by injected contrast agent and acquired either in a common phase or in two individual phases. The enhanced signals established by contrast agent are often not stably acquired due to non-optimal acquisition time. Inadequate contrast {{and the presence of}} large lesions in oncological patients, make the segmentation task quite challenging. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a framework with minimal user interactions to analyze venous <b>vasculatures</b> in multi-phase CT images. Firstly, presented <b>vasculatures</b> are automatically segmented adopting an efficient multi-scale Hessian-based vesselness filter. The initially segmented vessel trees are then converted to a graph representation, on which a series of graph filters are applied in post-processing steps to rule out irrelevant structures. Eventually, we develop a semi-automatic workflow to refine the segmentation in the areas of inferior vena cava and entrance of portal veins, and to simultaneously separate hepatic veins from portal veins. Segmentation quality was evaluated with intensive tests enclosing 60 CT images from both healthy liver donors and oncological patients. To quantitatively measure the similarities between segmented and reference vessel trees, we propose three additional metrics: skeleton distance, branch coverage, and boundary surface distance, which are dedicated to quantifying the misalignment induced by both branching patterns and radii of two vessel trees...|$|R
5|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes {{damage to the}} retina. Damage to the developing eye of infants exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from the eye damage experienced by adult divers under hyperbaric conditions. Hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for the disorder called retrolental fibroplasia or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants. In preterm infants, the retina is often not fully vascularised. Retinopathy of prematurity occurs {{when the development of}} the retinal <b>vasculature</b> is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use does not necessarily reduce the rate of retinopathy of prematurity, and may raise the risk of hypoxia-related systemic complications.|$|E

40|$|Retinal and choroidal {{vascular}} imaging {{is a key}} to {{the better}} understanding and diagnosis of eye diseases. To achieve comprehensive three-dimensional capillary imaging, we used an enhanced vascular imaging technique, so called adaptive optics optical coherence angiography (AO-OCA). AO-OCA enables in vivo high-resolution and high-contrast micro-vascular imaging by detecting Doppler frequency shifts. Using this technique, the retinal and choroidal <b>vasculatures</b> of healthy subjects were imaged. The results show that both intensity and Doppler power images have sufficient contrast to discriminate almost all <b>vasculatures</b> from the static tissue. However, the choriocapillaris, pre-arterioles, and post-venules in the Sattler layer were more contrasted by the Doppler technique. In conclusion, AO-OCA enables three-dimensional capillary imaging, and is especially useful for the detection of the choriocapillaris and choroidal capillary network...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of blood supply {{is crucial to}} the growth and progression of breast tumors. However, the con-tribution and role of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in blood vessel formation in human breast tumors is undefined. Here, we demonstrate {{for the first time that}} ~ 68 % of the cells integrated into <b>vasculatures</b> in late stage human breast tu-mors express CD 34 and CD 133 (the putative EPC markers). We also demonstrate that metastatic human breast cancer and mouse mammary gland carcinomas (MGCas) aberrantly express granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Inhibi-tion of the MGCa-derived G-CSF significantly decreased the numbers of EPCs in circulation and tumor <b>vasculatures,</b> as well as microvascular density and growth of transplanted MGCa in mice. These results indicate that EPCs may signifi-cantly contribute to blood vessel formation in advanced stage, G-CSF-expressing breast tumors and that patients with G-CSF-producing breast tumors may benefit from angiotherapeutic protocols that inhibit G-CSF-mediated neovasculariza-tion...|$|R

40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF-A or VEGF) {{is a potent}} growth factor for the {{development}} of retinal and choroidal <b>vasculatures.</b> To define the temporal requirement of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) -derived VEGF in choroidal vascular development, we generated conditional VEGF knockout mice using an inducible Cre/lox system. The loss of the RPE-derived VEGF was confirmed with immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Retinal function and structure were assessed with electroretinography and histology, respectively. Choroidal vascular density was analyzed with computer-assisted semi-quantitative assay using fluorescently labeled choroidal flat-mounts. Induction of RPE-specific VEGF disruption at embryonic day 10 (E 10) or E 13 for two days caused regulatable decreases in choroidal vascular density, photoreceptor function, and photoreceptor outer nuclear layer thickness. The loss of the RPE-produced VEGF after E 15 did not cause detectable defects in choroidal <b>vasculatures</b> and photoreceptor function and morphology. These results suggest that the RPE-derived VEGF plays a critical role in choroidal vascular development during organogenesis before embryonic day 15...|$|R
25|$|Several {{different}} cell {{types are}} critical to tumor growth. In particular, endothelial progenitor cells {{have been shown to}} have a strong influence on the growth of tumor blood-vessels. This finding was published in the journals Science (2008) and Genes and Development (2007) together with the fact that endothelial progenitor cells are critical for metastasis and angiogenesis. A publication in Cancer Research (August 2010) confirmed the importance of endothelial progenitor cells in tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. This seminal paper demonstrated that endothelial progenitor cells can be marked using the Inhibitor of DNA Binding 1 (ID1). This novel finding meant that investigators gained the ability to track endothelial progenitor cells from the bone marrow to the blood to the tumor-stroma and even incorporated in tumor <b>vasculature.</b> This finding of endothelial progenitor cells incorporated in tumor <b>vasculature</b> proves the importance of this cell type in blood-vessel development in a tumor setting and metastasis. Furthermore, ablation of the endothelial progenitor cells in the bone marrow can lead to a significant decrease in tumor growth and <b>vasculature</b> development. Therefore, endothelial progenitor cells are very important in tumor biology and present novel therapeutic targets.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{detection}} of vessel boundaries {{is particularly important}} for a precise extraction of <b>vasculatures</b> in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). In this paper, we propose the use of weighted local variance (WLV) -based edge detection scheme for vessel boundary detection in MRA. The proposed method is robust against changes of intensity contrast of edges and capable of giving high detection responses on low contrast edges. These robustness and capabilities are essential for detecting the boundaries of vessels in low contrast regions of images, which can contain intensity inhomogeneity, such as bias field, interferences induced from other tissues, or fluctuation of the speed related vessel intensity. The performance of the WLV-based edge detection scheme is studied and shown {{to be able to}} return strong and consistent detection responses on low contrast edges in the experiments. The proposed edge detection scheme can be embedded naturally in the active contour models for vascular segmentation. The WLV-based vascular segmentation method is tested using MRA image volumes.

25|$|Common {{ostriches}} develop via Intussusceptive angiogenesis, {{a mechanism}} of blood vessel formation, characterizing many organs. It {{is not only}} involved in <b>vasculature</b> expansion, but also in angioadaptation of vessels to meet physiological requirements. The use of such mechanisms demonstrates {{an increase in the}} later stages of lung development, along with elaborate parabronchial <b>vasculature,</b> and reorientation of the gas exchange blood capillaries to establish the crosscurrent system at the blood-gas barrier. The blood–gas barrier (BGB) of their lung tissue is thick. The advantage of this thick barrier may be protection from damage by large volumes of blood flow in times of activity, such as running, since air is pumped by the air sacs rather than the lung itself. As a result, the capillaries in the parabronchi have thinner walls, permitting more efficient gaseous exchange. In combination with separate pulmonary and systemic circulatory systems, it helps to reduce stress on the BGB.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. The {{effects of}} local intra-arterial infusions of {{serotonin}} (5 or 25 ^g base/min) or norepinephrine (1 or 5 /ig base/min) on cutaneous (skin) and skeletal muscle <b>vasculatures</b> were investigated in canine forelimbs perfused at constant flow in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital. Norepinephrine produced dose-related constriction {{of the skin}} and skeletal muscle <b>vasculatures.</b> In the cutaneous vascular circuit, norepinephrine produced large artery, small vessel, and large vein constriction. The increase in cutaneous vascular resistance was primarily due {{to an increase in}} small vessel resistance. Serotonoin did not increase skeletal muscle vascular resistance but produced marked cutaneous vasoconstriction subsequent to large artery and large vein constric-tion. The small vessels, if anything, tended to dilate. The skin and skeletal muscle vascular responses to serotonin and norepinephrine were similar in innervated and acutely denervated forelimbs. Phentolamine pretreatment completely blocked all vascular actions of norepinephrine, and largely inhibited the cutaneous vasoconstriction produced by the infusion of the low dose of serotonin. However, the cutaneous large artery and large vein constriction produced by the infusion of the high dose of serotonin was not affected by phentolamine pretreatment.

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} ultrahigh-speed, swept-source {{optical coherence tomography}} (SSOCT) angiography for visualizing vascular {{changes in}} eyes with nonexudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with geographic atrophy (GA). Design Observational, prospective, cross-sectional study. Participants A total of 63 eyes from 32 normal subjects and 12 eyes from 7 patients with nonexudative AMD with GA. Methods A 1050 -nm, 400 -kHz A-scan rate SSOCT system was used to perform volumetric optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) of the retinal and choriocapillaris (CC) <b>vasculatures</b> in normal subjects and patients with nonexudative AMD with GA. Optical coherence tomography angiography using variable interscan time analysis (VISTA) was performed to assess CC alteration and differentiate varying degrees of CC flow impairment. Main Outcome Measures Qualitative comparison of retinal and CC <b>vasculatures</b> in normal subjects versus those in patients with a clinical diagnosis of nonexudative AMD with GA. Results In all 12 eyes with GA, OCTA showed pronounced CC flow impairment within the region of GA. In 10 of the 12 eyes with GA, OCTA with VISTA showed milder CC flow impairment extending beyond the margin of GA. Of the 5 eyes exhibiting foveal-sparing GA, OCTA showed CC flow within the region of foveal sparing in 4 of the eyes. Conclusions The ability of ultrahigh-speed, swept-source OCTA to noninvasively visualize alterations in the retinal and CC <b>vasculatures</b> makes it a promising tool for assessing nonexudative AMD with GA. Optical coherence tomography angiography using VISTA can distinguish varying degrees of CC alteration and flow impairment and may be useful for elucidating disease pathogenesis, progression, and response to therapy.
