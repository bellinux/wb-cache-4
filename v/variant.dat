40|$|Under {{the premise}} that {{multiple}} causal <b>variants</b> exist within a disease gene {{and that we are}} underpowered to detect these <b>variants</b> individually, a variety of methods have been developed that attempt to cluster rare <b>variants</b> within a gene so that the <b>variants</b> may gather strength from one another. These methods group <b>variants</b> by gene or proximity, and test one gene or marker window at a time. We propose analyzing all genes simultaneously with a penalized regression method that enables grouping of all (rare and common) <b>variants</b> within a gene while subgrouping rare <b>variants,</b> thus borrowing strength from both rare and common <b>variants</b> within the same gene. We apply this approach using a burden based weighting of the rare <b>variants</b> to the Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 data. Background Genome-wide association studies have identified many common <b>variants</b> associated with complex diseases, yet these <b>variants</b> explain only a small proportion of the her-itability. Previous studies demonstrate that multiple rare <b>variants</b> (RVs) within the same gene can contribute to monogenic disorders. Availability of imputation an...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyzed}} 563, 099 common (minor allele frequency, MAF≥ 0. 01) {{and rare}} (MAF < 0. 01) genetic <b>variants</b> annotated in ExAC and UniProt and 26, 884 disease-causing <b>variants</b> from ClinVar and UniProt {{occurring in the}} coding region of 17, 975 human protein-coding genes. Three novel sets of genes were identified: those enriched in rare <b>variants</b> (n = 32 genes), in common <b>variants</b> (n = 282 genes), and in disease-causing <b>variants</b> (n = 800 genes). Genes enriched in rare <b>variants</b> have far greater similarities in terms of biological and network properties to genes enriched in disease-causing <b>variants,</b> than to genes enriched in common <b>variants.</b> However, in half of the genes enriched in rare <b>variants</b> (AOC 2, MAMDC 4, ANKHD 1, CDC 42 BPB, SPAG 5, TRRAP, TANC 2, IQCH, USP 54, SRRM 2, DOPEY 2, and PITPNM 1), no disease-causing <b>variants</b> {{have been identified in}} major, publicly available databases.

30|$|The ExAC {{database}} encompasses exome sequencing {{data from}} 60, 706 individuals. We searched for listed leptin <b>variants</b> and identified 36 missense, 1 in-frame deletion, and 3 loss-of-function <b>variants.</b> The functional relevance of these <b>variants</b> {{was assessed by}} the in silico prediction tools PolyPhen- 2, Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT), and Loss-Of-Function Transcript Effect Estimator (LOFTEE). PolyPhen- 2 predicted 7 of the missense <b>variants</b> to be probably damaging and 10 to be possibly damaging. SIFT predicted 7 of the missense <b>variants</b> to be deleterious. Three loss-of-function <b>variants</b> were predicted by LOFTEE. Excluding double counts, we can summarize 21 <b>variants</b> as potentially damaging. Considering the allele count, we identified 31 heterozygous but no homozygous subjects with at least probably damaging <b>variants.</b> In the ExAC population, the estimated prevalence of heterozygous carriers of these potentially damaging <b>variants</b> was 1 : 2000.
