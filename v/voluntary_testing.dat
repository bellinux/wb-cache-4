25|$|Around {{the same}} time, <b>voluntary</b> <b>testing</b> and {{counseling}} was made available in some communities, but, even where available, was rarely used. Reluctance to seek HIV testing was {{probably due to}} a number of causes – e.g., cost, inaccessibility of services, absence of any treatment, scant publicity or advocacy for testing, low or no perceived risk, and stigma {{associated with the use of}} testing services. Since 2004, the government has addressed the environmental barriers. The high cost was addressed in 2003 by making free HIV testing available for the poor, and later, under the 'Four Free and One Care' policy, antiretroviral therapy was made freely available for all through the Chinese health system. The number of screening laboratories has been expanded to 5500, and there are now 99 laboratories able to do confirmatory HIV tests. Free HIV testing has been made available, and expanded from 365 counties in 15 provinces in 2002 to over 2300 counties, with 3037 sites, in all provinces in 2006. The AIDS Regulations have introduced penalties for health units that do not provide free testing on request.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In Korea, the {{cumulative}} number of HIV-infected individuals {{was smaller than}} those of other countries. Mandatory HIV tests, dominating method until 1990 's, have been gradually changed to <b>voluntary</b> HIV <b>tests.</b> We investigated HIV seroprevalence status and its characteristics of visitors to Public Health Centers (PHCs), which conducted both mandatory <b>test</b> and <b>voluntary</b> <b>test</b> under the national HIV/STI surveillance program. Methods We used HIV-testing data from 246 PHCs in 2005 through the Health Care Information System. The number of test taker was calculated using the code distinguished by the residential identification number. The subjects were classified into four groups by reason for testing; General group, HIV infection suspected group (HIV ISG), HIV test recommended group (HIV TRG), and sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk group. Results People living with HIV/AIDS were 149 (124 male and 25 female) among 280, 456 individuals tested at PHCs. HIV seroprevalence was 5. 3 per 10, 000 individuals. Overall, the male revealed significantly higher seroprevalence than the female (adjusted Odds Ratio (adj. OR) : 6. 2; CI 3. 8 – 10. 2). Individuals aged 30 – 39 years (adj. OR: 2. 6; CI 1. 7 – 4. 0), and 40 – 49 years (adj. OR: 3. 8; CI 2. 4 – 6. 0) had higher seroprevalence than 20 – 29 years. Seroprevalence of HIV ISG (<b>voluntary</b> <b>test</b> takers and cases referred by doctors) {{was significantly higher than}} those of others. Foreigners showed higher seroprevalence than native Koreans (adj. OR: 3. 8; CI 2. 2 – 6. 4). HIV ISG (adj. OR: 4. 9; CI 3. 2 – 7. 5), and HIV TRG (adj. OR: 2. 6; CI 1. 3 – 5. 4) had higher seroprevalence than General group. Conclusion A question on the efficiency of current mandatory test is raised because the seroprevalence of mandatory test takers was low. However, HIV ISG included <b>voluntary</b> <b>test</b> takers was high in our result. Therefore, we suggest that Korea needs to develop a method encouraging more people to take <b>voluntary</b> <b>tests</b> at PHCs, also to expand the anonymous <b>testing</b> centers and <b>Voluntary</b> Counselling and <b>Testing</b> Program (VCT) for general population to easily access to HIV testing. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>voluntary</b> {{counselling}} and <b>testing</b> lay counsellors are not {{employees of}} the City of Johannesburg at Region F, but rather receive stipend money as an incentive from the non-governmental organisations. The <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing</b> lay counsellors seem to be unhappy and dissatisfied about their functions as demonstrated by their irregular attendance at the <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing</b> sites. It became difficult for the <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing</b> clients to access the <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing</b> service {{in the absence of}} the <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing</b> lay counsellors as they had to wait in the long queues in order to be attended to by the professional nurses. In most instances, the <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing</b> clients decided rather to leave the clinics without being attended to. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the lived experiences of the <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing</b> lay counsellors and professional nurses with regard to <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing</b> services offered in the City of Johannesburg at Region F. To address the problem a contextual, qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive phenomenological, research design was used in this study. A purposive sampling method was used. Individual, in-depth, phenomenological, semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data. The interviews were directed by two open-ended research questions. A model of trustworthiness with four components namely, credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability was followed. An open coding, qualitative data analysis method was used. The ethical considerations were taken into account. The results from the analysis of the transcriptions were described. Three main themes (1) lack of appropriate counselling rooms, (2) increased workload and staff shortages (3) lack of motivation and support and their related sub-themes in table 3. 1 were identified and conceptualised within the existing literature and concluding statements were made.

40|$|BACKGROUND: One of the {{consequences}} of Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection in women is the transmission of the virus to their children. <b>Voluntary</b> counseling and <b>testing</b> is an entry point for prevention of mother to child transmission). This study therefore, investigated readiness to <b>Voluntary</b> counseling and <b>testing</b> service utilization and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics using a health belief model. METHODS: Health institution based cross-sectional study supplemented with qualitative method was conducted at Debremarkos town from February 15 to March 25, 2008. A total of 418 Antenatal care clients were interviewed. In addition four focus group discussion and five in-depth interviews were performed.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. <b>Voluntary</b> {{counselling}} and <b>testing,</b> {{the cornerstone}} of HIV/AIDS prevention efforts worldwide, is at the centre of a policy debate rega rding its effectiveness. Informed by social constructionism and drawing on various tools from ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, a sample of twenty-seven vid eotaped simulated counselling interactions in South Africa was analysed. The aim was to assess how the interactional tasks of the <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing</b> sess ion were worked through by clients and counsellors, and how this was done against the publ ic health and counselling frameworks that inform <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing</b> pract ice. The goal of the analysis was not to examine practitioners’ competencies, but to exam ine their unfolding actions in the situation and to consider the interactional functio ns these actions might serve. The results show that of the three interactional ta sks of <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing,</b> information-giving lays the foundation upon which the advice and support goals are realised. It is constructed as critical to client a nd counsellor identities and is a powerful tool through which hope is dispensed. Both the info rmation-giving and support tasks of <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing</b> combine to manage client distress into more concrete and manageable terms that encourage client coping. Counsellors draw {{on a range of}} advice-giving strategies – those that place the onu s of responsibility on the client to those that view the counsellor as the moral guide able to direct client change – in order to encourage clients to reflect on their risk behaviou r. In general, <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing</b> is framed as a moral activity, and this is most evident in the advice-giving segments. The public health and counselling framewo rks that inform <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing</b> create a dilemma for counse llors. In practice, counsellors orient towards a directive and health-advising role rather than a non-directive, client-centred counselling role. The implication of this research is that <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing</b> needs to be defined and framed more clearly – i. e. as a public health intervention with preferred outcomes that draws on a set of client-centred skills. Reconceptualisations of <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing</b> need to acknowledge the mor al framework under which it operates. Clear implementation guidelines (and training) on what <b>voluntary</b> counselling and <b>testing</b> is and that define its goals more clearly will be useful in assisting counsellors to implement the policies that govern their practice...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{detection}} of HIV seroconverters increased annually since HIV antigen/antibody testing kits {{have been available}} widely in South Korea. This study aimed to identify the epidemiological characteristics of HIV seroconverters and their immune level at HIV diagnosis. MethodWe analyzed the epidemiological and immunological characteristics of 341 HIV seroconverters among 6, 008 HIV-diagnosed individuals from 1999 and 2009. The analysis of immune level and epidemiological factors of HIV seroconverters was conducted by using chi-square test on SAS version 9. 1. ResultsThe seroconverters among newly-identified HIV cases each year increased from 0. 5 % in 1999 to over 5 % or in 2009. The sex ratio of seroconverters was 18 : 1 (male:female), and 33 % were in their 30 s, and 28 % were in their 20 s. Reasons for HIV testing were involvement in <b>voluntary</b> <b>test</b> due to risky behaviors (43 %), and health check-up (36 %). Discovery of HIV infection occurred primarily in hospitals (84 %). Among seroconverters, 55 percent had a CD 4 T-cell count of more than 350 /μl.
