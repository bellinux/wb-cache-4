The proposed scheme enables, under specific assumptions, the analytical reconstruction of the rigid 3 D object’s surface, using the equations of the <b>support</b> <b>planes</b> and their respective distance map. As a direct consequence, the problem of calculating the force feedback can be analytically solved using only information about the 3 D object’s spatial transformation and position of the haptic probe. Several haptic effects are derived by the proposed mesh-free haptic rendering formulation. Experimental evaluation and computational complexity analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach can reduce significantly the computational cost when compared to existing methods...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} twisted {{surfaces}}. These surfaces are generated by synchronized rotations of a planar curve in its <b>supporting</b> <b>plane</b> and of this <b>supporting</b> <b>plane</b> about some axis. The resulting surfaces {{can be seen}} as generalizations of surfaces of revolution. The Möbius strip and the twisted Klein bottle are two well-known examples of twisted surfaces in Euclidean 3 -space. We provide an overview of what is currently known about twisted surfaces. Then, we classify flat and constant Gaussian curvature twisted surfaces in Euclidean 3 -space and prove that there exist no minimal twisted surfaces when excluding the surfaces of revolution. Finally, we suggest parameterizations for analogues of twisted surfaces in Minkowski 3 -space and give some examples. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a subgradient approach to nonlinear integer pro-gramming and, in particular, nonlinear 0 - 1 integer programming. In this approach, the objective function for a nonlinear integer program is {{considered as a}} nonsmooth function over the integer points. The subgradient and the <b>supporting</b> <b>plane</b> for the function are de ned, and a necessary and sucient condition for the optimal solution is established, based on the theory of nonsmooth analysis. A new algorithm, called the subgradient al-gorithm, is developed. The algorithm is in some sense an extension of Newton's method to discrete problems: The algorithm searches for a solution iteratively among the integer points. In each iteration, it generates the next point by solving the problem for a local piecewise linear model. Each local model is constructed using the <b>supporting</b> <b>planes</b> for the objective function at a set of previously generated integer points. A solution is found when either the optimality condition is satised or an iterate is repeated. In either case, the algorithm terminates in nite steps. The theory and the algorithm are presented. The methods for computing the <b>supporting</b> <b>planes</b> and solving the linear subproblems are described. Test results for a small set of problems are given...|$|R
