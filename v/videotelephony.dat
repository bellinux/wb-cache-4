Various universities and other organizations, including British Telecom's Martlesham facility, have also conducted extensive research on signing via <b>videotelephony.</b> [...] The use of sign language via <b>videotelephony</b> was hampered for many years due to the difficulty of its use over slow analogue copper phone lines, coupled with the high cost of better quality ISDN (data) phone lines. Those factors largely disappeared with the introduction of more efficient video codecs and the advent of lower cost high-speed ISDN data and IP (Internet) services in the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of <b>videotelephony</b> involved the historical {{development of}} several technologies which enabled {{the use of}} live video in addition to voice telecommunications. The concept of <b>videotelephony</b> was first popularized in the late 1870s in both the United States and Europe, although the basic sciences to permit its very earliest trials would take nearly a half century to be discovered. This was first embodied in the device which {{came to be known as}} the video telephone, or videophone, and it evolved from intensive research and experimentation in several telecommunication fields, notably electrical telegraphy, telephony, radio, and television.|$|E
50|$|At {{the dawn}} of the technology, <b>videotelephony</b> also {{included}} image phones which would exchange still images between units every few seconds over conventional POTS-type telephone lines, essentially the same as slow scan TV systems.|$|E
50|$|In the 2000s, <b>videotelephony</b> was popularized via free Internet {{services}} such as Skype and iChat, web plugins and on-line telecommunication programs that promoted low cost, albeit lower-quality, videoconferencing to virtually every location with an Internet connection.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 2010s <b>videotelephony</b> and {{videophones}} had become commonplace and unremarkable {{in various forms}} of media, {{in part due to}} their real and ubiquitous presence in common electronic devices and laptop computers. Additionally, TV programming increasingly utilized videophones to interview subjects of interest and to present live coverage by news correspondents, via the Internet or by satellite links. In the mass market media, the popular U.S. TV talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey incorporated <b>videotelephony</b> into her TV program on a regular basis from May 21, 2009, with an initial episode called Where the Skype Are You?, as part of a marketing agreement with the Internet telecommunication company Skype.|$|E
50|$|The H.263 {{standard}} was first {{designed to be}} utilized in H.324 based systems (PSTN and other circuit-switched network videoconferencing and <b>videotelephony),</b> but it also found use in H.323 (RTP/IP-based videoconferencing), H.320 (ISDN-based videoconferencing), RTSP (streaming media) and SIP (IP-based videoconferencing) solutions.|$|E
50|$|In September 2005, SkypeOut {{was banned}} in China. In October {{of the same}} year, eBay {{purchased}} Skype for $2.6 billion. (In 2011, the Ars Technica estimated the purchase price at $3.1 billion, not $2.6 billion.) In December 2005, <b>videotelephony</b> was introduced.|$|E
50|$|The service {{requirements}} for visual telephone services {{are presented in}} ITU-T Recs F.720 for <b>videotelephony</b> and F.702 for videoconference. Video and audio coding systems and other technical aspects common to audiovisual services are covered in other Recommendations in the H.200/F.700-series.|$|E
50|$|Although not {{as widely}} used in {{everyday}} communications as audio-only and text communication, useful applications include sign language transmission for deaf and speech-impaired people, distance education, telemedicine, and overcoming mobility issues. It is also used in commercial and corporate settings to facilitate meetings and conferences, typically between parties that already have established relationships. News media have begun to use desktop technologies like Skype to provide higher-quality audio than the phone network, and video links at much lower cost than sending professional equipment or using a professional studio. More popular <b>videotelephony</b> technologies use the Internet rather than the phone network, even accounting for modern digital packetized phone network protocols, and even though <b>videotelephony</b> software commonly runs on smartphones.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Videotelephony</b> {{comprises}} the technologies for the reception and transmission of audio-video signals by users at different locations, for communication between people in real-time. [...] A videophone is a telephone {{with a video}} display, capable of simultaneous video and audio for communication between people in real-time. Videoconferencing implies {{the use of this}} technology for a group or organizational meeting rather than for individuals, in a videoconference. [...] Telepresence may refer either to a high-quality <b>videotelephony</b> system (where the goal is to create the illusion that remote participants are in the same room) or to meetup technology which goes beyond video into robotics (such as moving around the room or physicially manipulating objects). Videoconferencing has also been called [...] "visual collaboration" [...] and is a type of groupware.|$|E

50|$|Currently <b>videotelephony</b> is {{particularly}} {{useful to the}} deaf and speech-impaired who can use them with sign language and also with a video relay service, and well as to those with mobility issues or those who are located in distant places and {{are in need of}} telemedical or tele-educational services.|$|E
50|$|With {{the rapid}} {{improvements}} and {{popularity of the}} Internet, <b>videotelephony</b> has become widespread through the deployment of video-enabled mobile phones, plus videoconferencing and computer webcams which utilize Internet telephony. In the upper echelons of government, business and commerce, telepresence technology, an advanced form of videoconferencing, has helped reduce the need to travel.|$|E
