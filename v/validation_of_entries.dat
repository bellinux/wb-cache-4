On the computational simulation side the department has developed an extendable software platform Coolfluid for high performance computational flow simulation which incorporates the research on numerical algorithms, advanced physico-chemical and plasma models as well as fluid-structure interaction and conjugate heat transfer.|$|R
40|$|The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) can {{identify}} cognitions that predict differences in behaviour between individuals. However, {{it is not}} clear whether the TPB can predict the behaviour of an individual person. This study employs a series of n-of- 1 studies and time series analyses to examine the ability of the TPB to predict physical activity (PA) behaviours of six individuals. Six n-of- 1 studies were conducted, in which TPB cognitions and up to three PA behaviours (walking, gym workout and a personally defined PA) were measured twice daily for six weeks. Walking was measured by pedometer step count, gym attendance by self-report with objective <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> gym <b>entry</b> and the personally defined PA behaviour by self-report. Intra-individual variability in TPB cognitions and PA behaviour was observed in all participants. The TPB showed variable predictive utility within individuals and across behaviours. The TPB predicted at least one PA behaviour for five participants but had no predictive utility for one participant. Thus, n-of- 1 designs and time series analyses can be used to test theory in an individual...|$|R

As the performance of PCs increases and broadband Internet access is more prevalent, switching between web pages is less painful than ever. One of the biggest advantages of AJAX is the ability for a web application to update only a small piece of data without refreshing the whole page. AJAX also allows for piecewise <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> user <b>entry</b> as opposed to the standard form entry with which we have become so accustomed. This paper describes how AJAX enabled applications are different from classic web applications and shows the advantages and disadvantages from both client and server sides of an AJAX enabled application. AJAX is not a new technology, but rather a new approach to web applications that uses standards already in place for XHTML, CSS, DOM, XML, and JavaScript. It is this new approach that eliminates the full page refresh that was so commonplace and now gives web applications the ability to look and feel more like desktop applications...|$|R
40|$|The Soil Profile Analytical Database of Europe of Measured {{parameters}} (SPADE/M) {{is part of}} {{the distribution}} package of the Soil Geographic Database of Eurasia (SGDBE). Typical combinations of profile parameters and morphological characteristics of the sample site were intended to support the definition of generalized rules for estimating pedological and hydrological properties of the pedo-transfer rule (PTR) database of the SGDBE. In 2005 the data of the SGDBE were transferred to a common data storage structure. In 2008 original hard-copies on profile measurements were re-discovered at the National Soil Resources Institute, Cranfield University (NSRI). To make the original data more generally available the profiles were added to the existing database.

40|$|This is {{the report}} of the first {{workshop}} on the <b>Validation</b> <b>of</b> Toxicogenomics-based Test Systems held in Ispra, Italy on 11 - 12 December 2003. The workshop was hosted by the European Centre for the <b>Validation</b> <b>of</b> Alternative Methods (ECVAM) and organized jointly by ECVAM, the U. S. Interagency Coordinating Committee on the <b>Validation</b> <b>of</b> Alternative Methods (ICCVAM), and the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM). The primary aim of the workshop was to discuss and define principles applicable to the <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> toxicogenomics platforms as well as <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> specific toxicological test methods that incorporate toxicogenomics technologies. The workshop was viewed as an opportunity for initiating a dialogue between technological experts, regulators, and the principal validation bodies, and for identifying those factors to which the validation process would be applicable. It was felt that to do so now, as the technology is evolving and associated challenges are identified, would {{serve as the basis for}} the future <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> the technology when it reached the appropriate stage. Due to the complexity of the issue, different aspects <b>of</b> the <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> toxicogenomics-based test methods were covered. The three focus areas included (a) biological <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> toxicogenomics-based test methods for regulatory decision-making, (b) technical and bioinformatics aspects related to validation, and (c) validation issues as they relate to regulatory acceptance and utilization of toxicogenomics-based test methods.

40|$|A tumour {{biomarker}} is {{a characteristic}} that is objectively measured and evaluated in tumour samples {{as an indicator}} of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. The development of a biomarker contemplates distinct phases, including discovery by hypothesis-generating preclinical or exploratory studies, development and qualification of the assay for the identification of the biomarker in clinical samples, and <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> its clinical significance. Although guidelines for the development and <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> biomarkers are available, their implementation is challenging, owing to the diversity of biomarkers being developed.
