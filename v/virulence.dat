5|$|Covacci et al. {{sequence}} the CagA gene, which encodes for a cytotoxin-associated surface protein, which correlated {{strongly with}} strains of H. pylori that caused duodenal ulcers. This {{was the first}} description of a <b>virulence</b> factor for H. pylori infection determined by molecular techniques.|$|E
5|$|Tomb et al. {{complete}} {{sequencing of}} the entire 1,667,867 base pairs of the H. pylori genome. This assists in identifying new <b>virulence</b> factors for the infectivity of H. pylori on the molecular level.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} {{refers to the}} transfer of genetic material through a mechanism other than reproduction. This mechanism is a common source of new genes in prokaryotes, sometimes thought to contribute more to genetic variation than gene duplication. It is a common means of spreading antibiotic resistance, <b>virulence,</b> and adaptive metabolic functions. Although horizontal {{gene transfer}} is rare in eukaryotes, likely examples have been identified of protist and alga genomes containing genes of bacterial origin.|$|E
5|$|In June 1457 he was {{personally}} responsible for intervening {{in the activities of}} Bishop Pecock, a virulent anti-Lollard. However, his <b>virulence</b> led to suspicions of heresy, which resulted in Beaumont's instigation of a formal examination into the bishop's sermons and writings; Peckock agreed to recant and abjured his heresy in November 1457, resigning his bishopric a year later.|$|E
5|$|In many bacteria, an S-layer of rigidly arrayed protein {{molecules}} {{covers the}} outside of the cell. This layer provides chemical and physical protection for the cell surface and can act as a macromolecular diffusion barrier. S-layers have diverse but mostly poorly understood functions, but are known to act as <b>virulence</b> factors in Campylobacter and contain surface enzymes in Bacillus stearothermophilus.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{sensitive to}} temperatures of 37°C {{can be used}} by pathogens to activate infection-specific genes. For example, the upregulation of prfA, encoding a key transcriptional regulator of <b>virulence</b> genes in Listeria monocytogenes, was demonstrated by fusing the 5' DNA of prfA to the green fluorescent protein gene; the gene fusion was then transcribed from the T7 promoter in E. coli, and fluorescence was observed at 37°C but not at 30°C.|$|E
5|$|The {{assembly}} of these extracellular structures {{is dependent on}} bacterial secretion systems. These transfer proteins from the cytoplasm into the periplasm or into the environment around the cell. Many types of secretion systems are known and these structures are often essential for the <b>virulence</b> of pathogens, so are intensively studied.|$|E
25|$|The pathogenetic {{pathways}} of Streptococcus dysgalactiae {{have not}} been explored in detail. Several <b>virulence</b> factors have been identified, but predominantly by screening S.dysgalactiae isolates for homologues of well-characterized S.pyogenes <b>virulence</b> genes. In a study of 216 S.pyogenes <b>virulence</b> genes, S.dysgalactiae was found to harbour approximately half of them. Indeed, whole-genome comparisons reveal a 70% -genetic similarity between the two species, indicating a common genetic ancestry. However, evidence of horizontal genetic transfer has also been reported.|$|E
25|$|The <b>virulence</b> factors {{implicated in}} E. rostratum {{pathogenicity}} {{are not well}} established. E. rostratum is a melanized fungus capable of thriving at mammalian temperatures. In other pathogenic fungi, melanin is a well established <b>virulence</b> factor thought to contribute to <b>virulence</b> by protecting the organism against the immune system of the host. Melanin production has also been associated with drug resistance to polyenes and echinocandins but not to azoles, which is why voriconanole is effective at treating fungal infections.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{produces a}} host of <b>virulence</b> factors in concert, {{under the control of}} the quorum sensing system. Many studies show that inhibiting quorum sensing down-regulates the pathogenicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, it has been shown that rhamnolipids specifically are a key <b>virulence</b> determinant in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A variety of <b>virulence</b> factors were analysed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from pneumonia patients. Rhamnolipids were found to be the only <b>virulence</b> factor that was associated with the deterioration of the patients to ventilator-associated pneumonia. Several other reports also support the role of rhamnolipids in lung infections. The effect of rhamnolipids in Pseudomonas aeruginosa <b>virulence</b> has been further noted in corneal infections (Alarcon et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2004). It has been shown that rhamnolipids are able to integrate into the epithelial cell membrane and disrupt tight-junctions. This study used reconstituted epithelial membranes and purified rhamnolipids to demonstrate this mechanism. In addition to inhibition and killing of epithelial cells, rhamnolipids are able to kill polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes and macrophages and inhibit phagocytosis. In summary, rhamnolipids have been shown unequivocally to be a potent <b>virulence</b> factor in the human host, however, they are also produced outside of the host, for example in a soil environment.|$|E
25|$|Parasite ecology is complex, usually {{involving}} hosts {{that have}} multiple parasites (multi-parasite hosts), parasites that have multiple hosts (multi-host parasites), and competition within a host. These interactions affect parasite and host reproduction and therefore evolution, including of the <b>virulence</b> of parasites and of methods of transmission. Reviewing the field, T. Rigaud and colleagues noted in 2010 {{that among the}} outcomes demonstrated empirically are that multiple infection can affect <b>virulence,</b> and can trigger evolutionary change; that the parasites involved in the same host may have contrasting transmission modes; and that assemblages of multiple parasites can be more virulent than would be expected from each individual parasite. Rigaud and colleagues also consider trade-offs of <b>virulence</b> among hosts (that adaptation for higher <b>virulence</b> in one host means lower <b>virulence</b> in others), predicting that when there are many hosts, the outcome will be non-specialist parasites with relatively low <b>virulence.</b> Where hosts differ in quality, Rigaud and colleagues predict that parasites should become optimally virulent in their primary host. On the other hand, they also predict that the more diverse the host community, the lower the incidence of parasites should be, because infecting hosts that are unsuitable or resistant means the loss of those parasites (wasted transmission).|$|E
25|$|HIV subtypes differ {{slightly}} in their transmissibility, <b>virulence,</b> effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy, and pathogenesis.|$|E
25|$|When {{the disease}} is {{transferred}} to a new host, there is a delay in <b>virulence,</b> known as parasitic fitness.|$|E
25|$|Targeting of {{identified}} bacterial {{proteins that}} are involved in complement inhibition would neutralize the key bacterial <b>virulence</b> mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Tuberculosis: Another {{possible}} explanation is that carriers of the gene could have some resistance to TB. This hypothesis is based on the thesis that CFTR gene mutation carriers have insufficient action in one of their enzymes – arylsulphatase - which is necessary for Mycobacterium tuberculosis <b>virulence.</b> As M. tuberculosis would use its host’s sources to affect the individual, and {{due to the lack of}} enzyme it could not presents its <b>virulence,</b> being a carrier of CFTR mutation could provide resistance against tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} infection, the bacteria need to escape the host immune response, and in streptococci, a varied arsenal of bacterial strategies have been described. The M-protein aids in immune evasion by inhibiting phagocytosis and inactivating the complement system. Furthermore, Streptococcus dysgalactiae possesses Protein G, a <b>virulence</b> factor binding circulating immunoglobulins, and thus interfering with the host antibody response. DrsG, a <b>virulence</b> protein abrogating the effect of antimicrobial peptides secreted by human immune cells, is also harboured by a subset of SDSE-strains.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} {{the manner in which}} viruses cause disease is viral pathogenesis. The degree to which a virus causes disease is its <b>virulence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bacterial ABC {{transporters}} {{are essential}} in cell viability, <b>virulence,</b> and pathogenicity. Iron ABC uptake systems, for example, are important effectors of <b>virulence.</b> Pathogens use siderophores, such as Enterobactin, to scavenge iron {{that is in}} complex with high-affinity iron-binding proteins or erythrocytes. These are high-affinity iron-chelating molecules that are secreted by bacteria and reabsorb iron into iron-siderophore complexes. The chvE-gguAB gene in Agrobacterium tumefaciens encodes glucose and galactose importers that are also associated with <b>virulence.</b> Transporters are extremely vital in cell survival such that they function as protein systems that counteract any undesirable change occurring in the cell. For instance, a potential lethal increase in osmotic strength is counterbalanced by activation of osmosensing ABC transporters that mediate uptake of solutes. Other than functioning in transport, some bacterial ABC proteins are also involved in the regulation of several physiological processes.|$|E
25|$|However, among {{competing}} parasitic insect-killing bacteria {{of the genera}} Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus, <b>virulence</b> {{depended on}} the relative potency of the antimicrobial toxins (bacteriocins) produced by the two strains involved. When only one bacterium could kill the other, the other strain was excluded by the competition. But when caterpillars were infected with bacteria both of which had toxins able to kill the other strain, neither strain was excluded, and their <b>virulence</b> was less than when the insect was infected by a single strain.|$|E

25|$|Several prokaryotic SOD null mutants {{have been}} generated, {{including}} E. coli. The loss of periplasmic CuZnSOD causes loss of <b>virulence</b> {{and might be}} an attractive target for new antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{bacterial}} endocarditis (ABE) is a fulminant illness over {{days to weeks}} (<2 weeks), and is more likely due to Staphylococcus aureus which has much greater <b>virulence,</b> or disease-producing capacity and frequently causes metastatic infection.|$|E
25|$|As an {{intercellular}} signal molecule, indole regulates {{various aspects}} of bacterial physiology, including spore formation, plasmid stability, resistance to drugs, biofilm formation, and <b>virulence.</b> A number of indole derivatives have important cellular functions, including neurotransmitters such as serotonin.|$|E
25|$|Subacute {{bacterial}} endocarditis (SBE) is often due to streptococci of low <b>virulence</b> (mainly viridans streptococci) and {{mild to moderate}} illness which progresses slowly over weeks and months (>2 weeks) and has low propensity to hematogenously seed extracardiac sites.|$|E
25|$|North, Northwest and Central Europe have {{favorable}} climates for <b>virulence.</b> The disease multiplies {{rapidly and}} survives longer in cooler environments around 21°C. At favorable conditions, the pathogen can survive 63 months in infected potato stems and 18 months in burlap sacs.|$|E
25|$|The Ti and Ri {{plasmids}} {{are themselves}} conjugative. Ti and Ri transfer between bacteria uses an independent system (the tra, or transfer, operon) from that for inter-kingdom transfer (the vir, or <b>virulence,</b> operon). Such transfer creates virulent strains from previously avirulent Agrobacteria.|$|E
25|$|Paramecia, or ciliates, {{can also}} affect Ae. albopictus larvae, {{and the first}} {{detected}} species was Lambornella stegomyiae (Hymenostomatida: Tetrahymenidae). The <b>virulence,</b> mortality rate, and subsequent possibilities of Lambornella being implemented as a biological remedy to control Ae. albopictus, however, has conflicting views.|$|E
25|$|RNA-Seq {{of human}} {{pathogens}} {{has become an}} established method for quantifying gene expression changes, identifying novel <b>virulence</b> factors, predicting antibiotic resistance and unveiling host-pathogen immune interactions. A primary aim of this technology is to develop optimised infection control measures and targeted individualised treatment.|$|E
25|$|Three key traits {{have evolved}} in S. mutans and {{increased}} its <b>virulence</b> by enhancing its adaptability to the oral cavity: increased organic acid production, {{the capacity to}} form biofilms on the hard surfaces of teeth, {{and the ability to}} survive and thrive in a low pH environment.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} factor {{found to be}} associated with antibiotic resistance is the decrease in the <b>virulence</b> capabilities of the resistant strain. Such findings {{have been reported in the}} case of rifampicin-resistant and colistin-resistant strains, in which decrease in infective ability, quorum sensing and motility have been documented.|$|E
25|$|Melanin {{production}} is a <b>virulence</b> factor {{found in many}} fungi that cause disease and its production in S. schenckii protects the fungus from oxidative stress as well as ultraviolet light and macrophage killing. Melanin {{has been shown to}} be synthesized using the 1,8-DHN pentaketide pathway (below).|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>virulence</b> and transmission is complex, and has important {{consequences for the}} long term evolution of a pathogen. Since it takes many generations for a microbe and a new host species to co-evolve, an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can be passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to <b>virulence,</b> as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing and coughing create infectious aerosols).|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} black yeasts that cause phaeohyphomycosis, melanin {{appears to have}} {{defensive}} purpose, and helps protect E. dermatitidis from death within human neutrophils. Pathogenic strains of E. dermatitidis contain five times more melanin than saprophytic E. dermatitidis, while melanin deficient mutants of pathogenic strains have dramatically reduced <b>virulence.</b>|$|E
