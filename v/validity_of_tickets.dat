50|$|Other {{information}} may be shown, often at {{the tops of the}} columns, such as day(s) of operation, <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> for each service, whether seat reservations are required, the type of vehicle used (e.g. for heritage railways and airline timetables), the availability of on-board facilities such as refreshments, availability of classes, and a service number. Timetables with services arranged in rows of tables and stops or stations in columns are less common but otherwise similar to timetables with services in columns.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets,</b> passes, etc., {{for a day}} or {{a number}} of days may end at midnight, or closing time, when that is earlier. However, if a service (e.g., public transport) {{operates}} from for example, 6:00 to 1:00 the next day (which may be noted as 25:00), the last hour may well count as being part of the previous day. For services depending on the day ("closed on Sundays", [...] "does not run on Fridays", and so on) there is a risk of ambiguity. For example, a day ticket on the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Dutch Railways) is valid for 28 hours, from 0:00 to 28:00 (that is, 4:00 the next day); the validity of a pass on Transport for London (TfL) services is {{until the end of the}} [...] "transport day"—that is to say, until 4:30 am on the day after the [...] "expiry" [...] date stamped on the pass.|$|E

5000|$|In public {{transport}}, {{a season}} ticket allows {{the user to}} travel by public transport an unlimited number of times within a period of time.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is the search for {{determinants}} of health expenditure of poor households in Cameroon. The study is the evaluation of the national health system in Cameroon and lists the challenges facing health centers. To achieve the results of the study, it was used a descriptive method of multiple correspondence analysis and an econometric model of left censoring of zero called Tobit. These results show that health expenditure of households are determined by the disease suffered by household members, the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ticket</b> sale that allows the patient to be diagnosed by a physician, examinations performed in the hospital and the educational level of head of household. These results lead to recommendations to improve access to health care for poor households and the assumption by the state of certain health expenses, monitoring / evaluation of socio-demographic indicators. ...|$|R

50|$|To use Videomaut, {{the user}} must buy a Videomaut ticket, either online or in person at an ASFINAG {{customer}} service centre or authorised point of sale. The route, number of travels, {{and the number}} plate {{of the car to}} be used must be specified. A Videomaut ticket is valid for one year from the date it is issued. When approaching a toll plaza, the user must enter the lane marked Videomaut and travel no faster than 15 km/h. The car's number plate is read and identified automatically, and the vehicle is allowed to pass. If the number plate cannot be read, or no valid Videomaut ticket is associated with the number plate, the user is directed into a regular toll lane and must show a copy of the receipt for the Videomaut <b>ticket</b> as proof <b>of</b> purchase to the toll cashier. The toll cashier verifies the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ticket</b> and allows the vehicle to continue or directs the driver to pay the special toll incurred if the ticket is invalid or has expired.

40|$|Buying {{a public}} {{transport}} ticket often makes the whole journey longer, {{so it would}} be convenient to have a electronic system at our disposal, that could make this task as easier as possible and without additional steps for the passenger. The wide use of mobile phones, their computational capabilities and their ability to connect to the Internet makes them suitable for solving this problem. This thesis describes the implementation of a system, which enables the use of mobile phones for acquiring public transport <b>ticket.</b> The development <b>of</b> mobile applications was done using two modern technologies, mobile operating system Android and Near Field Communication (NFC) for Nokia 6212. The passenger registers himself {{at the start of the}} journey with his mobile phone and receives an electronic ticket. The ticket is sent to the mobile phone in the form of QR barcode from the application on the server. The passenger registers himself again at the end of the journey, and the system finalizes his trip and calculates the fare. QR barcodes and RFID tags are used for registering passenger at the beginning and at the end of his journey. Mobile application user can also display train arrivals and see the amounts charged. Train conductor can use the Android application to check the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tickets.</b> A website was built, where new users of this system can register. Administrators can see the data on the journeys of users on another website. The system is designed in a way that users receive the receipt for their past journeys in their email once a month. The aim of this thesis was to explore the possibility of using RFID tags and QR barcodes along with mobile phones in public transport. This combination was found out to be very promising, what can also be seen in current use of similar systems in some countries. ...|$|R

50|$|The station {{attendant}} generally sells passenger tickets {{through a}} ticket window and posts the train schedules, while the train conductor or driver handles collection and validation <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> in most cases. Because the station attendant {{does not directly}} deal with the passengers outside <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> sales, the types <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> they can sell is generally limited to fare <b>tickets</b> and books <b>of</b> <b>tickets.</b> Because <b>of</b> this, kantaku stations are considered only one step above an unmanned station.

40|$|A digital {{ticket is}} a {{certificate}} that guarantees certain rights <b>of</b> the <b>ticket</b> owner.
