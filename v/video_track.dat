Both versions were included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Genic; the first video appeared as the second <b>video</b> <b>track,</b> whilst the second video was a hidden music <b>video</b> <b>track.</b> The music video received positive reviews from critics. Japanese music editor Random J called Amuro in the video [...] "too damn cute", and praised the production. The music video for [...] "Birthday" [...] was nominated for the MTV Japan Music Video Award for Best Female Video, whilst Amuro was independently nominated for Best Creativity Award on October 15, 2015; this was Amuro's first nominations in six years. During the ceremony, Amuro won both awards respectively.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> system {{raises a}} wide {{possibility}} in today’s society. This system {{is used in}} various applications such as security, monitoring, robotic, and nowa-days in day-to-day applications. However the <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> systems still have many open problems and many of research activities in a <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> system are explored. There-fore in this article, an overview of recent research activities in a <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> systems has been presented. In our survey, we have discussed the important issues related to a <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> system including current issues, methodology and future view of tracking system. In methodology section, we provide detailed description of four main tasks in tracking system: detection, tracking, object representation and recognize object behavior...|$|R

40|$|Background: Piercing-sucking {{insects are}} major vectors of plant viruses causing {{significant}} yield losses in crops. Functional genomics of plant resistance to these insects would greatly {{benefit from the}} availability of highthroughput, quantitative phenotyping methods. Results: We have developed an automated <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> platform that quantifies aphid feeding behaviour on leaf discs to assess the level of plant resistance. Through the analysis of aphid movement, the start and duration of plant penetrations by aphids were estimated. As a case study, <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> confirmed the near-complete resistance of lettuce cultivar ‘Corbana’ against Nasonovia ribisnigri (Mosely), biotype Nr: 0, and revealed quantitative resistance in Arabidopsis accession Co- 2 against Myzus persicae (Sulzer). The <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> platform was benchmarked against Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) recordings and aphid population development assays. The use of leaf discs instead of intact plants reduced {{the intensity of the}} resistance effect in <b>video</b> <b>tracking,</b> but sufficiently replicated experiments resulted in similar conclusions as EPG recordings and aphid population assays. One <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> platform could screen 100 samples in parallel. Conclusions: Automated <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> can be used to screen large plant populations for resistance to aphids and other piercing-sucking insects...|$|R

40|$|Color {{constancy}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} research areas {{with a wide range of}} applications in the fields of color image processing and computer vision. One such application is <b>video</b> <b>tracking.</b> Color is used as one of the salient features and its robustness to illumination variation is essential to the adaptability of <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> algorithms. Color constancy can be applied to discount the influence of changing illuminations. In this paper, we present a review of established color constancy approaches. We also investigate whether these approaches in their present form of implementation can be applied to the <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> problem. The approaches are grouped into two categories, namely, Pre-Calibrated and Data-driven approaches. The paper also talks about the ill-posedness of the color constancy problem, implementation assumptions of color constancy approaches, and problem statement for <b>tracking.</b> Publications on <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> algorithms involving color correction or color compensation techniques are not included in this review...|$|R

50|$|The {{objective}} of <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> is to associate target objects in consecutive video frames. The association {{can be especially}} difficult when the objects are moving fast relative to the frame rate. Another situation that increases {{the complexity of the}} problem is when the tracked object changes orientation over time. For these situations <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> systems usually employ a motion model which describes how the image of the target might change for different possible motions of the object.|$|R
40|$|<b>Video</b> <b>tracking</b> is a {{technique}} {{that is used to}} detect and track objects based on some typical features of the objects, and monitor their activities by image sequences taken by <b>video</b> cameras. <b>Video</b> <b>tracking</b> can be used in many areas especially in security-related areas such as airports, embassies, and battlefields. Mach research has been done with various hardware environments; most based on fixed position still cameras. In this report, we proposed a hardware platform for a <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> system based on Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras. The goal of this work is to realize a prototype of a video surveillance system, which can provide high-end <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> functions based on a mobile server platform. The system consists of three PTZ cameras, frame grabber, Pentium 4 PC, and optional wireless transmitter and receiver for video and data communication. Camera controlling software has been implemented in Visual C++ to control the cameras. Some basic camera functions such as panning, tilting, zooming, focusing, AGC, ALC, etc., have been implemented. Although we can only control one PTZ camera at a time, it is easy to achieve camera handover using camera ID identifier and camera positio...|$|R

However the <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> systems still have many open problems and various research activities in a <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> system are explores. This paper presents an algorithm for <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> of any moving target {{with the use of}} edge detection technique within a window filter. The proposed system is suitable for indoor and outdoor applications. Our approach has the advantage of extending the applicability of tracking system and also, as presented here it improves theperformance of the tracker making feasible to be more accurate in detection and tracking objects. The goal of the tracking system is to analyze the video frames and estimate the position of a part of the input video frame (usually a moving object), our approach can detect and track any moving object and calculate its position. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} construct a motion tracking system for moving object. Where, at the end of this paper, the detail outcome and results are discussed using experimental results of the proposed technique...|$|R
