40|$|AbstractTo {{create a}} winning brand, the stylist, {{aesthetic}} designer, and company managers should continuously innovate without straying from the brand's car history, {{and they should}} use the country's culture as a value system and as background inspiration. In this context, the proposed approach assumes that aesthetic judgments related to the country identity of the car, rely on the car's important (primitive) <b>characteristics</b> <b>lines,</b> which have been considered foundational and necessary to make this determination. The issue is then to identify, extract and to interpret these <b>characteristic</b> <b>lines.</b> The proposed approach is based on two important hypotheses. The first hypothesis, called the singularities hypothesis, stipulates that the singularities {{can be used to}} identify the <b>characteristic</b> <b>lines</b> in cars’ style. The second hypothesis, called primitives hypothesis, stipulates that cars of different brands, with their specific style, can be used in order to identify and extract characteristic styling primitives. Three spaces have been defined: the stylist space, the CAD space and the interpretation-emotional space. The CAD approach for identification and extraction of <b>characteristic</b> <b>lines</b> has been implemented in CAD environment. The approach has been applied to the identification, extraction and characterization of <b>characteristic</b> <b>lines</b> of French cars as well as the German cars. The application has shown a geometrical difference between the French <b>characteristic</b> <b>lines</b> and the German <b>characteristic</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R

We examined 32 companies {{listed on the}} Athens Stock Exchange {{on a weekly basis}} for a period from June 2009 to December 2013 under this model. The CAPM model is tested by performing two-pass characteristic regression analyses. The first-pass <b>characteristic</b> <b>line</b> regression was used to estimate stocks of beta. Hence, the second-pass <b>characteristic</b> <b>line</b> regression was taken to analyze the intercept and the slope coefficients of stocks. The two <b>characteristics</b> of <b>line</b> regression verify the adequacy of the CAPM. According to our results, we came to a conclusion that there was a linear relationship between systematic risk and returns. The CAPM would be the verification of our major hypotheses from the time series tests. In order for this to be true, the intercept ought to be approximately equal to zero, supporting the theories for both individual assets and portfolios. However, the testing provides evidence against the CAPM, but do they do? It should be kept in mind that it does not necessarily represent evidence in favor of any alternative model...|$|R
