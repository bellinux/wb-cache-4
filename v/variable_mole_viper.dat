40|$|A new {{simplified}} fully implicit compositional simulator {{has been}} developed. This simulator {{is different from}} existing models because it combines the conventional black oil equations with a compositional injection component equation. Sets of two dimensional pvt and injection component K value tables at constant pressure and <b>variable</b> <b>mole</b> fraction injection component are generated using a cubic equation of state used in the compositional simulator. The data are generated {{from a series of}} cells loaded with the initial composition of the reservoir. Pore volume increments of injection gas are cycled through the cells in sequence, with oil and gas volumes passing downstream in proportions calculated by the relative permeability curves. This pvt test replicates a one dimensional compositional cycling process at fixed pressure. The resulting data describes a unique compositional path through the phase diagram for constant pressure and <b>variable</b> <b>mole</b> fraction injection gas, and this path is independent of cell position in the simulator. The simulator runs at speeds that far exceed the speeds in current compositional simulators, primarily because the speed is independent of the number of components. Small problems with several hundred cells typically run about 10 times faster, and larger speed increases are realized for bigger problems. The simulator has been tested successfully for gas cycling projects including the Third SPE Comparative Solution Project and CO 2 flooding projects.

Two component chitosan/glutaraldehyde co-monomers were reacted at <b>variable</b> <b>mole</b> ratios (1 : 15, 1 : 25 and 1 : 35). Three-component copolymers containing β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) were obtained by reacting variable mass ratios of β-CD with chitosan (1 - 3, 1 - 1 and 1 - 1 / 3; chitosan/β-CD (w/w)). The chitosan/glutaraldehyde fraction was held constant at a 1 : 6 mole ratio comparable to the two-component copolymers. The two- and three-component biopolymer materials were characterized using TGA, FT-IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis (C, H & N). The solid-solution isotherm properties in aqueous solutions for the biopolymers were characterized with two detection methods (UV-Vis and ICAP-OES) with two types of adsorbates, respectively; p-nitrophenol (PNP) and arsenate oxoanion (HAsO 4 2 -) at alkaline conditions. The Langmuir (i. e. Sips restricted) and the Sips sorption isotherm models were utilized to obtain sorption parameters at pH 8. 5 and 295 K, (i. e. surface area estimates, sorption capacities and removal efficiencies) for each biopolymer material. The surface area estimates are as follows for the 1 : 15, 1 : 25 and 1 : 35 chitosan-based two-component biosorbent materials: the Sips restricted values are 46. 7, 46. 7 and 31. 6 m 2 g- 1 and the Sips values are 124, 46. 7 and 31. 6 m 2 g- 1 for the low molecular weight chitosan material. The Sips restricted are 58. 7, 54. 2 and 64. 7 m 2 g- 1 and for the Sips are 79. 8, 64. 7 and 96. 3 m 2 g- 1 for the high molecular weight chitosan material, respectively. The surface area estimates are as follows for the 1 - 3, 1 - 1 and 1 - 1 / 3 chitosan and v β-cyclodextrin three-component biopolymer materials: for the Sips restricted are 34. 6, 54. 2 and 116 m 2 g- 1 and for the Sips are 275, 51. 2 and 161 m 2 g- 1, respectively. Removal efficiencies are dependent upon the pH, temperature, and the relative amount of sorbent and sorbate. The removal efficiencies of p-nitrophenol by the biopolymers ranged between 7. 1 and 48. 9 % for low and high molecular weight chitosan biosorbent materials. The removal efficiencies of pnitrophenol by three components, the chitosan, β-cyclodextrin and glutaraldehyde biopolymers ranged between 7. 3 and 28. 0 %. The removal efficiencies of the arsenate oxoanion by the biopolymers ranged between 30. 7 and 92. 2 % for low and high molecular weight chitosan biosorbent materials.

The governing evolution equation for the phase field <b>variable,</b> the solute <b>mole</b> fraction and the temperature are formulated and numerically solved using an explicit finite difference scheme. To make the computations tractable, parallel computing is employed. The results obtained show that under lower cooling rates, the solidification process is controlled by partitioning of the solute between the solid and the liquid at the solid/liquid interface. At high cooling rates, on the other hand, solute trapping takes place and solidification is controlled by the heat extraction rate. An in-crease in the cooling rate is also found to have a pronounced effect on the dendrite microstructure causing it to change from poorly developed dendrites consisting of only primary stalks, via fully developed dendrites containing secondary and tertiary arms to the diamond-shaped grains with cel-lular surfaces.

40|$|TutorialAlthough wet (oil injected) and dry (oil free) screw {{compressors}} {{are widely used}} in many applications, limited information is available regarding the pulsation, vibration, and noise problems associated with these types of compressors. This tutorial discusses such problems and includes case histories where field testing was performed, and provides design recommendations. Both wet and dry {{screw compressors}} normally generate pulsation at the pocket passing frequency (PPF) and its multiples. The pulsation amplitudes are affected by many <b>variables</b> such as <b>mole</b> weight of the gas, operating pressures, speed, screw profile, {{and shape of the}} discharge port. The pulsation amplitudes are further amplified by acoustical natural frequencies of the compressor/silencer/piping system. Dry screw compressors are generally supplied with suction and discharge silencers which are designed to attenuate the pulsation generated by the compressors. Most of the silencers are reactive type (Helmholtz filters), absorptive type, or a combination of these two. Although the silencers are designed to attenuate pulsation at certain frequencies, they can also amplify pulsation when the excitation frequencies are coincident with the acoustical natural frequencies of the silencer itself. Pulsation in the silencers can also increase the vibration levels of the compressor rotors and can cause electrical problems to be fed into the local bus. Therefore, the silencers should be carefully designed to attenuate the pulsation levels over a wide frequency band. Wet screw compressors typically do not have silencers, since oil separators are used. The oil separators are primarily designed to remove the oil from the gas, but the separators can also attenuate and/or amplify the pulsation generated by the compressor. The shell wall mechanical natural frequencies can also be excited by pulsation at multiples of the PPF, which can result in excessive noise levels and fatigue failures of the shell wall, attached small bore piping, instrumentation, and the oil injection lines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{research}} work details a systematic {{study of the}} structure and function of supramolecular host-guest systems. Host-guest inclusion complexes were formed between β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD) and its copolymers (as hosts), with several types of guest molecules both in aqueous solution and the solid state. The research {{is divided into two}} themes; (1) structural characterization and dynamic properties of the inclusion compounds of β-CD with various guest systems in aqueous solution and the solid phase, and (2) heterogeneous adsorption and structural studies of β-CD based copolymers with various guest systems in aqueous solutions. The guest systems include alkyl and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates, perfluoroalkyl sulfonate, and p-nitrophenol (PNP) at variable experimental conditions. In the first theme (chapter 2 - 5), host-guest complexes in the solid state were prepared using dissolution and slow cool methods at <b>variable</b> host/guest <b>mole</b> ratios (i. e., 1 : 1 and 2 : 1). The complexes were further characterized using 19 F/ 13 C DP/MAS and CP/MAS solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The solution state complexes were prepared in D 2 O for structural characterization using 1 H/ 19 F NMR spectroscopy. The NMR studies were complemented using FT-IR, thermal analyses (DSC, and TGA), and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Evidence for the formation of host-guest inclusion compounds (ICs) was provided using CP/MAS solids NMR spectroscopy and complexation-induced chemical shift (CIS) values of 1 H/ 19 F nuclei in aqueous solution. The β-CD/PFC ICs displayed variable guest geometry and hydration states as determined by the host-guest stoichiometry and the conformation of the guest. PFOA and SPFO form 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 ICs with β-CD, wherein the guest adopts a range of gauche and trans conformations, respectively. 1 : 1 host-guest complexes were concluded for short perfluorocarbon chains (i. e., PFBA) where the gauche conformation of the PFC guest in the bound state was favoured. In the second theme (chapters 6 – 8), β-CD based copolymers were used as host materials. The structural characterization of a soluble poly-CD material (known as HDI- 1) revealed that the solution behaviour of such polymeric hosts are sensitive to the presence of guest compounds such as p-nitrophenol (PNP) (i. e. chemo-responsive), as well as temperature variations (i. e. thermo-responsive). The host-guest chemistry of the soluble poly-CD material, as studied by 2 -D solution NMR and induced circular dichroism (ICD) spectroscopy, indicates that PNP was bound within the cavity sites of β-CD and the interstitial domains of the copolymer (cf. Scheme 1. 6 and chapter 6). The observed responsive nature of such polymeric host materials to temperature variation and chemical potential resembles behaviour characteristic of ‘smart materials’. Herein, ‘smart materials’ refer to systems which are responsive to external stimuli (e. g. temperature and chemical). The adsorption properties of the soluble (HDI- 1) and insoluble (HDI- 3 and - 6) poly-CD adsorbents with octyl and perfluorooctyl carboxylate and sulfonate anions were estimated using the Sips and BET models. The hydrocarbon (HC) and fluorocarbon (FC) anions form monolayer and multilayer structures at the surface of the polymeric adsorbents, respectively. The formation of layered structures was controlled by the relative hydrophobicity of the alkyl/perfluoroalkyl chains and their mutual miscibility with the adsorbent surface. Other factors include the inductive effects of the alkyl/perfluoroalkyl head groups and their interactions with aqueous solvent or dipolar domains of the adsorbent surface. The adsorbed species at the liquid-solid interface were characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy, thermal analyses, and contact angle...|$|R

All experiments were conducted according to a face-centred cube design. Under optimum conditions (12. 3 % of enzyme; 45 °C; 29. 4 h), the incorporation of CA was 20. 0 % into ARASCO. Optimization of acidolysis of DHASCO with CA gave rise to a maximum of 22. 6 % at 4. 2 % enzyme amount, and a reaction temperature of 43. 3 °C and reaction time of 27. 1 h. Similarly, the maximum incorporation of CA into the OMEGA-GOLD oil was obtained when enzyme amounts, reaction temperature and time were 2. 5 %, 46. 6 °C and 25. 2 h, respectively. [...] Stereospecific analysis was performed to establish positional distribution of fatty acids on the glycerol backbone of modified ARASCO, DHASCO and the OMEGA-GOLD oil. In all oils examined CA was mainly located at the sn- 1 and sn- 3 positions of the triacylglycerol (TAG) molecules. In ARASCO-based SL, arachidonic acid (ARA) was mostly esterified at the sn- 2 position of the glycerol backbone. In DHASCO-based SL, DHA was concentrated in the sn- 2 position, but also present in the sn- 1, 3 positions. DHA or DP A were preferentially esterified at the sn- 2 position of the modified OMEGA-GOLD oil. [...] The oxidative stabilities of enzymatically modified oils as well as their unmodified counterparts were assessed under Schaal oven conditions at 60 °C over a 72 h storage period. Conjugated dienes (CD), and 2 -thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were used to follow the primary and secondary products of oxidation, respectively. Among the oils tested, the structured lipids (SL) of ARASCO, DHASCO, and the OMEGA-GOLD oil had higher conjugated dienes than those of their unmodified counterparts. TBARS values of modified DHASCO were significantly higher than their origin oil at all times. TBARS values of both modified and unmodified ARASCO increased gradually over the entire storage period. TBARS values of the OMEGA-GOLD-based SL increased steadily with increasing storage time. The results presented in this study suggest that enzymatically modified oils are more susceptible to oxidation than their unmodified counterparts. However, when the three oils (ARASCO, DHASCO and the OMEGA-GOLD) were subjected to the same procedure steps, the stabilities of the oils were adversely affected to a large extent. This observation might possibly be due to the loss of natural antioxidants during the reaction work up...|$|R
