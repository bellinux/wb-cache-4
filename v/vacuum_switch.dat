2500|$|CDI {{triggered}} by {{two sets of}} points. A basic problem with the rotary engine design {{is a lack of}} engine braking, partially due to the mass of the rotor. Leaning of the mixture on overrun also contributes to erratic and [...] "lumpy" [...] running. One way to solve the problem is to shut off ignition entirely on overrun, but this leads to excessive contamination of the combustion chamber by unwanted deposits, which can cause the apex seals to stick. Suzuki opted for a compromise by using two sets of ignition points. One set of points ran on a dual lobe cam for normal operation, firing the rotor every face. The other set ran on a single cam on the same shaft for triggering the spark plug on overrun. The second set (the B points) were {{triggered by}} an rpm sensor (the speed relay) and a <b>vacuum</b> <b>switch,</b> which meant that they worked on engine deceleration (high vacuum) and above 1,700rpm. This system fired the rotor every second face. This kept the combustion chambers relatively clean. It also served to smooth the lumpy feel of the bike as RPM reduced on overrun and addressed some issues with backfiring (more correctly, [...] "afterfiring"). Engine braking is also significantly improved. The B point system was discontinued on the [...] "A". It is believed that the factory also employed mechanics to visit dealerships and disconnect the B points on any [...] "M" [...] (1975) models still in the showrooms. Suzuki {{toyed with the idea of}} two plugs like the Mazda's, but as with so much of their engineering on this bike, overthought the application, believing that they would require two plugs of different heat ranges. The idea was dropped, and the bike shipped with a single 18mm conical seat gold palladium spark plug housed in a copper insert in the rotor housing (NGK A9EFV).|$|E

50|$|The use of <b>vacuum</b> for <b>switching</b> {{electric}} currents {{was motivated}} by the observation that a 1 cm gap in an X-ray tube could withstand {{tens of thousands of}} volts. Some <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> devices were patented in the 19th century but were never commercially available. In 1926, at California Institute of Technology a group lead by Professor Royal Sorensen investigated <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> and tested several devices. Sorenson presented the results at an AIEE meeting that year, and predicted the commercial use of <b>vacuum</b> <b>switches.</b> Many fundamental aspects of arc interruption in vacuum were investigated. In 1927, the General Electric corporation purchased patent rights and began commercial development. However, the Depression and development of oil-filled switchgear caused General Electric to reduce development work. Little commercially important work was done for vacuum power switichgear until the 1950s.|$|R

In 1966 devices were developed with a rated voltage of 15 kV and breaking currents of 25 kA and 31.5 kA.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{effective}} {{engine control unit}} computers, engine vacuum was used for many functions in an automobile. Vacuum switches were employed to regulate this flow. For instance a dual port <b>vacuum</b> <b>switch</b> located in a port on the intake manifold monitored the coolant temperature in the coolant crossover. It received vacuum (port E on the switch) from the carburetor. The vacuum flowed through the switch to a vacuum solenoid (such as a heat riser, used to restrict exhaust allowing the engine to heat up faster). When the coolant heated to operating temperature the <b>vacuum</b> <b>switch</b> closed off the port (port S on the <b>vacuum</b> <b>switch)</b> turning off the vacuum to the heat riser. The result is to clear the exhaust restriction. The switch monitored the temperature and when conditions were right it performed its designed function.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental studies of voltage phenomena in the <b>switching</b> operations of <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> devices made by various manufacturers in several different configurations of 6 kV, 10 kV, 20 kV and 35 kV networks. During switching-on operations of the inductive loads, re-ignition of the electric arc between the contacts of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> devices appears. Each arc ignition appearance leads to overvoltages with gradients close to those of lightning overvoltages. Switching-off operations of the inductive loads with <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> devices leads to the cutting of the current before it passed through a natural zero and the appearance of multiple re-ignition of the arc between their contacts. All this leads to significant overvoltages on the equipment insulation. The analysis of surges in the studied networks, and the measures and means to reduce the stress of isolation are proposed...|$|R

50|$|Selec-Trac {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the full-size Jeeps (SJ) in 1983 using the New Process NP228 and NP229 transfer cases. These {{are very similar to}} the Quadra-Trac NP219 transfer case described in the next section below. The differences are 1) they added a 2WD mode for fuel savings and 2) the 2WD-to-4WD modes were controlled via a <b>vacuum</b> <b>switch</b> on the dashboard. The Hi-N-Lo range selection was still performed using a shift lever on the console. The NP228 differs from the NP229 by not having the viscous coupling in 4WD Hi mode, reverting to a simpler open center differential. Both transfer cases still lock the center differential in 4WD Lo mode. The NP228/229 transfer cases were available in the full-size Jeeps from 1983 to 1991. The NP228 was also available in the XJ Cherokee and Wagoneers and the MJ Comanche pickups from 1984 until replaced by the NP242 in 1987. Several companies have offered a dual shift lever conversion which replaces the <b>vacuum</b> <b>switch</b> and solenoid with a more reliable second console lever for 2WD-4WD mode selection.|$|E
50|$|The {{enclosure}} of the interrupter is made {{of glass}} or ceramic. To ensure that the interrupter vacuum is maintained {{over the life of}} the device, there must be hermetic seals between metal and ceramic components. The enclosure material must be impermeable to gas and must not give off trapped gas over its lifetime. The function of the stainless steel bellows not only isolates the vacuum state inside the vacuum interrupter from the external atmosphere, but also moves the movable contact with the conductor within a specified range to complete the closing and breaking of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>switch</b> operating.|$|E
40|$|In the {{international}} IEC standards for medium and HV switching devices no distinction in test requirements is made between switching devices with different arc-quenching media, like SF 6, oil and vacuum. This {{had led to}} the situation that due to the different technology of arc interruption applied, {{various aspects of the}} prescribed test-procedures have a different weight in terms of severity for various types of breakers. Additional test-requirements and interpretations that are specific to <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> devices have been formulated commonly by the joint major test laboratories. In this contribution, the background and practical application of several procedures, now generally adopted by certifying test-laboratories, regarding the peculiarities of <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> devices are elucidated. Because the <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> device has an excellent capability to interrupt current of high frequency, the main part of this contribution will be related to the consequences for test procedures of this aspect that is not encountered in SF 6 or oil breakers. In particular, the judgment of non-sustained disruptive discharges, multiple re-ignition and virtual current chopping in test-circuits is addressed. Results of a new high-resolution high-frequency current-zero measuring system are presented.

50|$|Heated {{air intake}} systems operate on the {{principle}} of increasing the temperature of the air. The fuel will more effectively stay in suspension in the air rather than falling out of suspension and forming droplets {{on the floor of the}} manifold. Warm air from the outside of an exhaust manifold is drawn up into the air cleaner to increase the air temperature as quickly as possible after the engine starts. The air cleaner assembly incorporates a thermostatic <b>vacuum</b> <b>switch</b> that responds to the air temperature after the air filter element and actuates a vacuum motor that moves the control flap to allow the air to be drawn from a cooler location such as the top of the engine bay or outside the engine bay. If the air becomes too cold, the thermostatic switch will automatically change back to drawing heated air from around the outside of the exhaust.|$|E
5000|$|Axles were Dana 44 {{front and}} 9¼" [...] or 8 1/4" [...] Chrysler {{corporate}} rear.

In 1980 when the part-time 4WD system was introduced, the front Dana 44 was equipped with a more conventional front wheel bearing design and automatic locking hubs. Late in the 1984 model year the Dana 44 was switched to a CAD (Center Axle Disconnect) version. The CAD Dana 44 was vacuum actuated by a switch on the transfer case and powered by engine vacuum.
