5000|$|The ride {{is divided}} into sections, with {{different}} names (legs, phases, loops etc.), depending on sanctioning organization. After each section, horses are stopped for a <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspection</b> (sometimes called a [...] "vetgate"), where they are checked for soundness and dehydration, with their pulse and respiration taken. To continue the ride, the horse must pass the examination, including reducing its heart rate below that specified for the event, typically 64 bpm, although terrain and weather may require the ride veterinarians to set a different maximum target. The riders' time keeps running until their horses reach the required target, so {{it is important that}} the horses recover as soon as possible. Any horse deemed unfit to continue (due to lameness or excessive fatigue, for example) is eliminated from further competition.|$|E

50|$|The {{implementation}} of the quality management standard initiated several strategically significant technical-technological and constructional investments. In 2008, the application area of BRC Standard was extended to the full production range, while in the year 2009 HALAL standard has also been implemented which defines the conditions for food producers and so could be exported in the countries with mostly Muslim population. Thanks to the intensive joint work with the Veterinary Administration, the positive assessment by the European Commission, Mlekara Subotica was on the list. The Commission’s decision was a confirmation of quality {{and the safety of}} products, which results in a 30 million euro investment of Danube Foods Group in all aspects of business since it became the majority owner in 2003. In 2010, Mlekara Subotica adapted and improved its operations according to modern concepts of environmental protection and introduced the environmental management system ISO 14001:2004. The entire system of production and business was brought to the required level when the control of the EU commission was announced {{in the first quarter of}} 2010, thus confirmed the decision of the <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Inspection</b> of Serbia which approved the export of products of Mlekara Subotica to the EU. In 2011 was brought another standard to Mlekara Subotica called IFS V5, which improved the food safety and product quality, as well as should be increase security and confidence of consumers and among all improve cost efficiency in the food chain.|$|E

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: This {{study investigated the}} physiology of endurance horses competing in warm weather over technical terrain, a situation where horses may become metabolically compromised. Hypotheses: There will be changes in physiological, haematological and biochemical variables as horses progress through the 160 km ride and horses detected clinically at the <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspections</b> as metabolically compromised will have significant differences in measured laboratory variables compared to horses that complete the ride successfully. Methods: Forty-eight horses competing in the Australian Tom Quilty 160 km endurance ride were monitored and weighed, and blood samples collected for analysis of electrolytes, packed cell volume (PCV), plasma protein and acid-base variables, preride, mid-ride, {{at the end of}} their ride and the following morning after a period of recovery. Statistical analysis was performed using multinomial logistic regression and repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Of the 48 horses participating in the study, only 18 successfully completed the ride (SC), 16 were eliminated for lameness (VOL) and 10 for metabolic reasons (VOM); 4 were voluntarily withdrawn by the riders. A lighter preride bodyweight was predictive for VOM. PCV and total plasma protein increased mid-ride in all groups compared to preride, with significantly greater increases in PCV for VOM compared to the other horses. Changes were detected in blood concentrations of sodium, chloride and calcium over time and between the groups, with lower mid-ride sodium and chloride in VOM compared to SC and VOL. Conclusions: VOM horses weighed less preride and were, on analysis of blood and physiological variables mid-ride, more dehydrated with greater electrolyte depletion than the SC or VOL horses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{major problem}} about today's sports horses {{is that they}} are prone to be damaged. In harness racing, the {{workload}} is very high and this study seeks to give an overview of how to solve the problem. There are many factors that come into play when assessing the risk of injury to the horse, and some examples of such factors are the intensity of the exercise, the <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspection</b> before the competition, the trainer in the form of its age, experience and training schedules, the horse's upbringing and the horse's age. The study was conducted using a questionnaire that was spread through Svensk Travsport's website and Facebook page, which was directed to all active trainers with warmblooded trotters. In the result, I was able to find a link between a high training intensity and the proportion of injured horses. The harder the horse got to train the greater the danger was that the horse would suffer damage. I also found that a high training intensity did not always give the horse an improved performance but could lead to overtraining, which meant that the horse, without noticeable physical changes, performed worse in terms of slower kilometers times. In addition, I found that a <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspection</b> before the competition could reduce the percentage damage arising in connection with the competition. Many injuries derives from a previous minor injury that may be difficult to detect. With a medically qualified person who has no connection to the starting rig, performes an inspection also those minor injuries can be detected. The result also showed that radiographic changes such as osteochondrosis and other joint problems affect the sustainability of the horse. However it depends in part on where the change is located. A change in the tarsal joint provides less impact than, for example, a change in the fetlock. I could also find that the horse's upbringing was strongly linked to the existence of joint changes. My conclusion was that you {{need to look at the}} horse's training schedule to better individualize the training for the horses age and physical conditions. The need to introduce a thorough <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspection</b> before competitions to find small changes in horses that can lead to immense problems. You also need to take into account the young horse and its growth when searching for a sustainable individual. Horses are often hurting themselves at a certain age and that there may be a connection between this and micro injuries. The factors that affect the risk factor is the <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspection,</b> the experience of the trainer, workout intensity, if the horse is capable of premium race as a 2 -year-old, the horse's age, age at first competition, rest periods, irregular exercise, X-ray findings, genetics and muscle fatigue...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In Belgian draught horses, {{disability}} and disfigurement {{of the lower}} limbs has been present for decades. Only in 2003 the term chronic progressive lymphoedema (CPL) was assigned to this devastating disorder, which is most practically diagnosed by clinical research. A veterinary scoring system (CPL score) has been created to define CPL condition of the limbs in draught horses. Other factors that have been related to CPL prevalence (skin condition, weight, age and sex) could confirm assigned scores and subsequently improve CPL diagnosis. Therefore, {{the relationship between the}} occurrence of CPL and these different phenotypic characteristics was investigated. Additionally, as a measure of skin condition, skinfold thickness was studied. Methods and results: Data are based on clinical <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspections</b> at official horse meetings (14) and farm visits (27) in Belgium (October 2009 -Februari 2011), covering 856 horses. Skinfold thickness was measured with a Harpenden skinfold caliper. Statistical analysis was performed using a general linear model, including age, sex, body weight, height at withers and skinfold thickness. Consistent with previous studies, mares show lower mean CPL scores compared to stallions (1. 98 and 2. 21 respectively, on a scale from 1 = no CPL to 5 = extreme CPL). An analogous sex difference can be observed for skinfold thickness (means respectively 5. 3 cm and 7. 8 cm). There is a significant sex dependent relationship between CPL scores and age (P< 0. 001) : males tend to develop clinical symptoms faster than females. Also skinfold thickness and CPL scores are significantly related (P= 0. 0026). Body weight and height at withers could not be related to CPL scores (n= 76 individuals). Conclusions: CPL in Belgian draught horses is related to skinfold thickness and affected by sex and age. Skinfold thickness measurements of draught horses could confirm CPL diagnosis in the field. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In South Africa, {{communal}} {{livestock farming}} is predominant {{in the foot}} and mouth disease control zone adjacent to the Greater Kruger National Park (KNP), where infected African buffaloes are common. During routine <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspections</b> of cattle in this area, a large amount of production and demographic parameters were being recorded. These data were collated for a five-year period (2003 - 2007) in three study sites to better understand the temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity in this system. A decreasing gradient from South to North with respect to both human and cattle population densities was observed. Rainfall and human population density alone could explain 71 % of the variation in cattle density. Northern and central sites showed an overall decrease in total cattle numbers (15. 1 and 2. 9 %, respectively), whereas a 28. 6 % increase was recorded in the South. The number of cattle owners in relation to cattle numbers remained stable during the study period. Only 4. 0 % of households in the South own cattle, compared to 13. 7 and 12. 7 % in the North and Centre. The overall annual calving rate was 23. 8 %. Annual mortality rates ranged from 2. 4 to 3. 2 %. Low calf mortality (2. 1 %) was recorded in the North compared to the South (11. 6 %). Annual off-take in the form of slaughter averaged 0. 2, 11. 7, and 11. 0 % in the North, Central and South sites, respectively. These figures provide valuable baseline data and demonstrate considerable spatial heterogeneity in cattle demography and production at this wildlife-livestock interface, which should be taken into consideration when performing disease risk assessments or designing disease control systems.
