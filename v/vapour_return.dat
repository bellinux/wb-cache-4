50|$|Phase 3 was {{announced}} in May 2007 to increase storage, ship unloading and vapourisation capabilities. A fourth 190,000 m3 LNG storage tank was constructed {{to the east of}} the three existing tanks. A second jetty (Jetty No. 8) was constructed on the River Medway (after demolition of the former jetty 8) together with an associated cryogenic pipeline to the existing transfer pipeline. The jetty has three 16-inch loading arms and a 16-inch <b>vapour</b> <b>return</b> arm. The jetty is capable of handling LNG tankers of 125,000 to 266,000 m3 cargo capacity (QMax). The 36-inch diameter 4.5 km nickel-steel pipeline has a flexible polyurethane (PUR) foam insulation in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) casing, the line transfers LNG between the jetty and the storage sites. There is also a 14-inch recirculation line. Additional facilities included further submerged combustion vapourisers; boil-off gas compressors; nitrogen facilities; and a vent stack. The development provided an additional five million tonnes of capacity per annum. All this capacity was contracted out from December 2010. Customers included BP, Iberdrola, Sonatrach, Centrica, E.ON and GDF Suez.|$|E

6000|$|The {{changing}} of Bodies into Light, and Light into Bodies, is very conformable to the Course of Nature, which seems delighted with Transmutations. Water, {{which is a}} very fluid tasteless Salt, she changes by Heat into Vapour, which is a sort of Air, and by Cold into Ice, which is a hard, pellucid, brittle, fusible Stone; and this Stone returns into Water by Heat, and <b>Vapour</b> <b>returns</b> into Water by Cold. Earth by Heat becomes Fire, and by Cold returns into Earth. Dense Bodies by Fermentation rarify into several sorts of Air, and this Air by Fermentation, and sometimes without it, returns into dense Bodies. Mercury appears sometimes {{in the form of a}} fluid Metal, sometimes in the form of a hard brittle Metal, sometimes in the form of a corrosive pellucid Salt call'd Sublimate, sometimes in the form of a tasteless, pellucid, volatile white Earth, call'd Mercurius Dulcis; or in that of a red opake volatile Earth, call'd Cinnaber; or in that of a red or white Precipitate, or in that of a fluid Salt; and in Distillation it turns into Vapour, and being agitated in Vacuo, it shines like Fire. And after all these Changes it returns again into its first form of Mercury. Eggs grow from insensible Magnitudes, and change into Animals; Tadpoles into Frogs; and Worms into Flies. All Birds, Beasts and Fishes, Insects, Trees, and other Vegetables, with their several Parts, grow out of Water and watry Tinctures and Salts, and by Putrefaction return again into watry Substances. And Water standing a few Days in the open Air, yields a Tincture, which (like that of Malt) by standing longer yields a Sediment and a Spirit, but before Putrefaction is fit Nourishment for Animals and Vegetables. And among such various and strange Transmutations, why may not Nature change Bodies into Light, and Light into Bodies? ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCustom {{ultrasonic}} instruments {{have been}} developed for continuous monitoring and real-time measurement of composition and flow in binary gas mixtures. These characteristics are derived from measurements of sound transit time along two opposite directions - parallel or tilted to the gas flow direction. The flow rate is then calculated from the transit time difference while the average is used to compute sound velocity by comparison with a sound velocity/composition database. Five devices are integrated in the Detector Control System of the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Three instruments monitor C 3 F 8 and CO 2 coolant leaks into the nitrogen-purged envelopes of the inner silicon tracker; respectively with precisions better than ± 2 ´ 10 - 5 and ± 10 - 4.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{increasingly}} popular climate change debate worldwide, maritime transport is under pressure to create sustainable solutions for a cleaner future. One of these solutions is using liquefied natural gas (LNG) as ship fuel. LNG has a higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratio compared with oil-based fuels, which results in lower specific CO 2 emissions (kg CO 2 /kg fuel). Other benefits of LNG are the total elimination of SOx emissions and particulate matter, and 85 - 90 % reductions in NOx emissions. DNV has estimated a net global warming benefit of 15 % {{with the use of}} LNG. However there is still a need to map the greenhouse gas emissions throughout the life cycle of LNG. This thesis is a Screening Life Cycle Assessment of LNG as fuel, with the main objective to carry out a life cycle analysis of the process &# 147;Bunkering of LNG&# 148;. Screening is a simplified LCA which aims at identifying the important parts of a life cycle, or so-called hotspots. Bunkering of LNG and the bunkering facility have been chosen as the hotspots in this analysis for their uniqueness. The processes related to bunkering have not been analysed at this level of detail in published literature. The LCA software GaBi Educational has been used to implement the bunkering model and analyse the life cycle inventory results. Processes related to energy use, manufacturing and direct emissions were included in the GaBi model. The CML 2001 method was used to assess the Global Warming Potential (GWP). This is the main characterisation factor of the environmental issue climate change, which was in focus in this analysis. The impact assessment showed that emissions related to manufacturing are the greatest contributors to the GWP, with a total GWP of 75 917 [kg CO 2 -Equiv]. Energy use contributes the least, with only 0, 36 &# 137; of the total impact, which is considered negligible. Direct emissions stand for 7 777 [kg CO 2 -Equiv] and is the only area of the bunkering life cycle where emissions can be considerably reduced. In fact, all direct emissions can be omitted by the use of BOG recovery strategies, such as <b>vapour</b> <b>return.</b> The conclusion drawn is that the emissions associated with bunkering of LNG is perhaps not the main issue. A more pressing issue at the moment is the low fuelling possibilities for LNG. If LNG is to become the fuel of the future, fuelling must be made more accessible and available. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} {{detecting}} organic vapour environments of nine different solvents by polyisoprene-high structured carbon composite (PHSCBC) sensors is reported. The electric {{resistance of the}} composite {{is found to be}} increased as soon as it contacts the <b>vapour</b> and to <b>return</b> to the initial value after being removied from the environment. To reveal the mechanism of the effect, simultaneous measurements of electrical resistance, elongation, and changes caused by sorption of organic solvent molecules in the bulk of PHSCBC samples were made in real time. From sorption experiments it has been found that the increase of electric resistance is generally dominated by absorption of solvent molecules in the matrix material, subsequently swelling it up and increasing the distance between conductor particles. The experiments prove that a remarkable and rapid change of the resistance could be explained by change of the tunnelling currents between adjacent carbon nano-particles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInjection {{of large}} {{quantities}} of CO 2 for underground geological storage in shallow or deep saline aquifers {{will lead to a}} strong water desaturation of the near wellbore because of drying mechanisms. Even the capillary trapped water can be removed by thermodynamical transfert of water vapour in the CO 2 phase. In this context, drying mechanisms can precipitate the salt present in the aquifer and then lead to injectivity alteration. In this study, we investigated experimentally the alteration of permeability induced by drying of brine in porous media for different rocks and different brines. Initial characterization on four types of dry rock sample representative of storage rocks was performed including gas permeability and porosity measurements. Two sandstones and two carbonate rocks of large and medium permeability were tested to evaluate the effect of rock type and initial permeability on the injectivity alteration. Each sample was fully saturated with a brine of different salt composition (KCl, NaCl and Keuper brine, a mixture of salt representative of the Paris Basin brine aquifer) and different salinity up to 250  g/L. The samples were then completely dried in an oven at controlled temperature and with <b>vapour</b> evacuation. <b>Return</b> gas permeabilities were then measured on each sample after full drying. Local analysis at the pore scale, with scanning electron microscopy and micro-Xray scanner have been done to observe the type of flow obstruction and the spatial repartition of the salt deposit in the pore matrix...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{work has}} aimed to {{identify}} how sloshing will affect a {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) fuel tank. The physical nature of LNG means {{it needs to be}} kept cooled and pressurized in order to remain in a liquid state. By implementing a pressure build-up unit (PBU) it is possible to pressurize the tank vaporizing the tank’s contents, for the <b>vapour</b> then to <b>return</b> to tank in a loop, building pressure in the process. A tank pressure build-up unit has been built in the laboratory at the university, which will be used for conducting experiments on sloshing. To be able to perform calculations on the system, the efficiency of the electrical heater is found through a simple experiment, measuring the mass of water the heater is able to vaporize per minute, as well asmeasuring the electrical power used. Four different power settings are tested, showing that the relation between flow and power are close to linear, meaning {{that it is possible to}} interpolate the vaporized flow should one want to use a different power setting than the ones already tested. The electrical power tested ranges between 570 - 2019 W, with the efficiency ranging from 83. 8 - 95. 2 %. The difference in efficiency is likely due to the water level rising when subject to higher levels of power, thus utilizing more of the heating coil, which is not fully submerged initially. The heat loss of the system, or more specifically the heat transfer coefficient between the interior of the tank and its environment is found through logging of the system’s temperature as the tank cools down, having initially been heated up to temperature of more than 110 °C. Once the liquid and vapour temperature are equal, one can assume that no heat transfer is happening inside the tank, thus the following drop in temperature is due to heat loss to the surroundings. By recording the drop in temperature over a given time, the heat transfer coefficient is then calculated to beU Æ 0. 31 W/m 2 K. To find howsloshing affects this specific system, several tests are performed at different frequencies in order to observe how the severity of the sloshing affects the thermodynamical properties within the tank. The tank is heated to predetermined parameters, before the heater is turned off for the sloshing to be initiated, this in order to be in control over the amount of energy present in the systemwhen the sloshing is performed. It is found that sloshing definitely increases heat and mass transfer over the liquid-vapour interface when compared to test conducted where no iv tank motion is initiated. There is a clear distinction in heat and mass transfer between the different sloshing frequencies as well, where the general perception is that a higher frequency of sloshing results in a higher rate of energy transfer. It is attempted to conduct a series of experiments where the heater is on during the tests, in order to see if compensation of the pressure drop during sloshing was possible. It is found that utilizing the heater does result in reduced drop in pressure, in addition to showing that pressure compensation is possible in lower frequencies with the electrical power at disposal for these experiments, albeit not entirely stable. With control regulation, compensation should work well. The effect sloshing would have on heat and mass transfer was calculated from results gathered from the experiments. Calculating for a selection of tests with sloshing period ranging from T= 2. 50 seconds to T= 4. 00 seconds, as well as for a reference test with no tank excitation, it is found that sloshing at the lowest frequency tested, T= 4. 00 seconds, increases heat and mass transfer by 75 % compared to the case with no tank excitation. The rate of heat and mass transfer increases as the sloshing frequency increases, calculations showing a 500 %increase for sloshing period T= 2. 50 seconds...|$|R
