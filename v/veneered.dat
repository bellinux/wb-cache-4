The office was built using the traditional Japanese post and lintel type construction using unplaned timber logs. The office served as a proving ground for the latest American building innovations including <b>veneered</b> plywood and suspended metal ductwork for forced air heating. Taking influence from Le Corbusier's modulor, Raymond used the traditional Japanese module of the ken (based upon the size of tatami mats) as a unit of measure to set out the building's structure.

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} {{microwave}} <b>veneer</b> drying are described. The {{final moisture content}} profiles and quality of two dried <b>veneer</b> thicknesses A and B (3 and 1. 5 mm in thickness respectively) are determined. <b>Veneer</b> gluability of the two <b>veneer</b> thicknesses, dried by two different methods, are examined. The dimensional stability of <b>veneer</b> and plywood samples made from these dried <b>veneers</b> are also examined. Green {{weight per unit area}} was used as an indicator of moisture content during drying. A wide variation in final moisture content of dried <b>veneer</b> was found to be due to the presence of earlywood and latewood in <b>veneer</b> sample A and juvenile wood in <b>veneer</b> sample B. Green <b>veneer</b> sorting, based on water content per area or volume, green weight per area and percent saturation, can be used to improve drying performance. Statistical analysis indicates that the final <b>veneer</b> moisture content profiles estimated from green weight per unit area for two dried <b>veneer</b> thicknesses A and B dried by microwave, are not significantly different from those under conventional drying. However, the result indicates that microwave drying resulted in a higher degree of moisture content uniformity for both <b>veneer</b> thicknesses, whereas excessive drying occurred on the outer sections for both <b>veneer</b> thicknesses under conventional drying. A dark color was found in the dried <b>veneer</b> of both thicknesses under microwave drying compared to those of conventionally dried <b>veneers.</b> Statistically, both drying methods resulted in similar <b>veneer</b> quality, except microwave drying resulted in better <b>veneer</b> quality with respect to flatness, and has a low flatness ratio. Microwave dried <b>veneer</b> also had low percent shrinkage for both <b>veneer</b> thicknesses compared to conventionally dried <b>veneer</b> samples. <b>Veneer</b> gluability for <b>veneer</b> A is better than for <b>veneer</b> B, higher in the percentage of wood failures and greater glueline shear strength. Microwave drying resulted in better <b>veneer</b> gluability.

In November 1971, the Galaxy Game prototype debuted. The <b>veneered</b> walnut console, complete with seats for players, was located {{on the second floor}} of the building and connected to the PDP-11 in the attic by a 100-foot cable. It was very successful; Pitts later said that the machine attracted crowds of people [...] "ten-deep" [...] watching the players. They briefly attached a second monitor hanging above the console so that the watchers could more easily see the game. The low prices meant that they did not come close to making back the price of the PDP-11, but they were excited by the game's reception and had not intended the prototype to be profitable. As the initial Galaxy Game prototype was displayed to the public a few months after the first Computer Space prototype, it is believed to be the second video game to charge money to play.|$|E
