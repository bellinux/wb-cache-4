40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{implications}} of a recently proposed pattern of Lorentz symmetry violation on very high-energy cross sections. As {{a consequence of the}} breaking of local Lorentz invariance by the introduction of a fundamental length, $a$, the kinematics is modified and the properties of final states are fundamentally different in collider-like (two incoming particles with equal, opposite momenta with respect to the <b>vacuum</b> rest <b>frame)</b> and fixed-target (one of the incoming particles at rest with respect to the <b>vacuum</b> rest <b>frame)</b> situations. In the first case, the properties of the allowed final states are similar to relativistic kinematics, as long as the relevant wave vectors are much smaller than the critical wave vector scale $a^{- 1 }$. But, if one of the incoming particles is close to rest in the <b>vacuum</b> rest <b>frame,</b> energy conservation reduces the final-state phase space at very high energy and can lead to a sharp fall of cross sections starting at incoming-particle wave vectors well below the inverse of the fundamental length. Then, the Froissart bound may cease to be relevant, as total cross sections seem to become much smaller than it would be allowed by local, Lorentz-invariant, field theory. Important experimental implications of the new scenario are found for cosmic-ray astrophysics and for very high-energy cosmic rays reaching the earth.

40|$|Should {{projects}} of space experiments on ultra-high energy cosmic rays be supported, whatever AUGER results {{will turn out}} to be? We claim that this is indeed the case. It is now widely admitted that models of Lorentz symmetry violation (LSV) at the Planck scale based on power-like extrapolations down to cosmic-ray scales and able to account for a possible absence of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff exist and require the existence of a privileged inertial rest frame, as we proposed in 1997 (paper physics/ 9704017 and subsequent work). The favoured energy dependence of the LSV parameter will then be quadratic rather than linear. This approach (weak doubly special relativity, WDSR) is different from the version of doubly special relativity defended by several authors, where the laws of Physics are required to be exactly identical in all inertial reference frames (strong doubly special relativity, SDSR). To date, WDSR patterns based on a deformation of special relativity with a privileged (<b>vacuum)</b> rest <b>frame</b> are the only clear and consistent candidate to explain a possible absence of the GZK cutoff invoking deviations from standard relativity. It is also to be emphasized, as in hep-ph/ 0510361, that the usual hypothesis of a power-like dependence of the LSV effective parameters not being altered by any intermediate energy scale is not the only possible one. Therefore, experiments sensitive to UHCR energies as high as possible become necessary irrespective of AUGER results.

It can be deduced without any mathematics only from the assumption that all good clocks can be used to measure time with the same results, independently of the machinery involved in their manufacturing. A second important assumption, intrinsic to the very notion of time, is that clocks measure time in the same way in different frames, i. e., the notion of time is the same in all inertial frames. Under this assumption, we point out that the "postulate" of constancy of the "two-way" speed of light in <b>vacuum</b> in all <b>frames</b> independently of the state of motion of the emitting body is also strongly related to the concept of time, together with the existence of a limit speed in the "rest frame".

40|$|It is not {{yet clear}} whether the {{observed}} flux suppression for ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) at energies above ≃ 4. 10 E 19 eV is a signature of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff or corresponds, for instance, to the maximum energies available at the relevant sources. Both phenomena can be sensitive to violations of standard special relativity modifying cosmic-ray propagation or acceleration at very high energy, and would in principle allow to set bounds on Lorentz symmetry violation (LSV) parameters. But the precise phenomenological analysis of the experimental data is far from trivial, and other effects can be present. The effective parameters can be directly linked to Planck-scale physics or to physics beyond Planck scale. If a <b>vacuum</b> rest <b>frame</b> (VRF) exists, LSV can modify the internal structure of particles at very high energy. Conventional symmetries may also cease to be valid at energies close to the Planck scale. Other possible violations of fundamental principles and conventional basic hypotheses (quantum mechanics, quark confinement, energy and momentum conservation, vacuum homogeneity and "static" properties, effective space dimensions [...] .) can also be considered and possibly tested in high-energy cosmic-ray experiments. Even below UHE (ultra-high energy), exotic signatures cannot be excluded. We present an updated discussion of the theoretical and phenomenological situation, including prospects for earth-based and space experiments and a simple potential interpretation of the observed UHECR composition in terms of LSV where the GZK cutoff would be replaced by spontaneous emission of photons or e+ e- pairs.

40|$|Quantum fields possess zero-point or vacuum {{fluctuations}} which induce mechanical effects, namely generalised Casimir forces, on any scatterer. Symmetries of vacuum therefore raise {{fundamental questions}} {{when confronted with}} the principle of relativity of motion in vacuum. The specific case of uniformly accelerated motion is particularly interesting, {{in connection with the}} much debated question of the appearance of <b>vacuum</b> in accelerated <b>frames.</b> The choice of Rindler representation, commonly used in General Relativity, transforms vacuum fluctuations into thermal fluctuations, raising difficulties of interpretation. In contrast, the conformal representation of uniformly accelerated frames fits the symmetry properties of field propagation and quantum vacuum and thus leads to extend the principle of relativity of motion to uniform accelerations. Mirrors moving in vacuum with a non uniform acceleration are known to radiate. The associated radiation reaction force is directly connected to fluctuating forces felt by motionless mirrors through fluctuation-dissipation relations. Scatterers in vacuum undergo a quantum Brownian motion which describes irreducible quantum fluctuations. Vacuum fluctuations impose ultimate limitations on measurements of position in space-time, and thus challenge the very concept of space-time localisation within a quantum framework. For test masses greater than Planck mass, the ultimate limit in localisation is determined by gravitational vacuum fluctuations. Not only positions in space-time, but also geodesic distances, behave as quantum variables, reflecting the necessary quantum nature of an underlying geometry.
