40|$|INTRODUCTION: There {{have been}} 3 {{outbreaks}} of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in Uganda {{in the last}} 2 years. VHF often starts with non-specific symptoms prior to the onset of haemorrhagic signs. HIV clinics in VHF outbreak countries such as Uganda see large numbers of patients with HIV 1 / 2 infection presenting with non-specific symptoms every day. Whilst there are good screening tools for general health care facilities expecting VHF suspects, {{we were unable to}} find tools for use in HIV or other non-acute clinics. METHODS: We designed tools to help with communication to staff, infection control and screening of HIV patients with non-specific symptoms in a large HIV clinic during the outbreaks in Uganda. We describe our experiences in using these tools in 2 Ebola Virus Disease outbreaks in Uganda. RESULTS: During the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreaks, enhanced infection control and communication procedures were implemented within 24 hours of the WHO/Ministry of Health announcement of the outbreaks. During course of these outbreaks the clinic saw 12, 544 patients with HIV 1 / 2 infection, of whom 3, 713 attended without an appointment, suggesting new symptoms. Of these 4 were considered at risk of EVD and seen with full infection procedures; 3 were sent home after further investigation. One patient was referred to the National Referral Hospital <b>VHF</b> <b>unit,</b> but discharged on the same day. One additional VHF suspect was identified outside of a VHF outbreak; he was transferred to the National Referral Hospital and placed in isolation within 2 hours of arriving at the HIV clinic. DISCUSSION: Use of simple screening tools can be helpful in managing large numbers of symptomatic patients attending for routine and non-routine medical care (including HIV care) within a country experiencing a VHF outbreak, and can raise medical staff awareness of VHF outside of the epidemics...|$|E

40|$|Project 1. Relict Leopard Frog Monitoring, Management, and Research Fall surveys {{completed}} at all natural and translocation sites. Coordination {{for a potential}} translocation site on BLM lands in the Gold Butte area ongoing – the aim is that this site {{will be ready for}} translocations in 2008. Coordination ongoing for evaluation of a translocation site on BLM lands in the Black Mountains, AZ – the plan is to complete compliance in 2008. Coordination and assistance provided to UNLV research efforts on habitat improvements at Blue Point, Rogers, and Pupfish Refuge springs. Relict Leopard Frog Conservation Team meeting held in December. Draft annual report completed. Annual Work Plan and Detailed Timeline associated with MSHCP project completed. Data Management Plan associated with MSHCP project completed. Project 2. Bald Eagle Winter Monitoring and Evaluation Technical assistance provided for project consultations with Clark County. • Preparations for the 2008 winter count initiated. Project 3. Peregrine Falcon Monitoring and Evaluation Technical assistance provided for project consultations with Clark County. Peregrine falcon monitoring activities initiated in December to evaluate the onset of courtship activities. Preparation for 2008 population surveys initiated. Preparations to evaluate call-broadcast methodology initiated. Project 4. Assessment of Six Covered and Three Evaluation Bird Species Technical assistance provided for project consultations with Clark County. Annual Work Plan and Detailed Timeline associated with MSHCP project completed. Two Data Management Plans associated for companion MSHCP projects completed. Selection and evaluation of field sites for intensive monitoring surveys initiated. Work on thrasher modeling ongoing. Project 5. Desert Tortoise Monitoring and Management. Compliance activity completed. Population surveys removed from a modification of this task agreement. Project 6. Shorebird Monitoring on Lakes Mead and Mohave Twenty-one surveys were conducted this quarter of monitored sites on Lakes Mead and Mohave. Project 7. Desert Bighorn Sheep Habitat Use Monitoring in Relation to Highway Development. GPS collars were released this quarter as programmed; efforts to retrieve these collars have been hampered by battery failures in both satellite and <b>VHF</b> <b>units.</b> Other Activities A part-time research assistant was hired to assist with compiling and assessing historical location data for targeted songbirds...|$|R
40|$|Project 1. Relict Leopard Frog Monitoring, Management, and Research Translocation program {{initiated}} this quarter, {{egg mass}} collections completed, tadpole rearing underway. Egg mass surveys at Blue Point Spring conducted approximately weekly; one egg mass collected from site for headstarting. Spring nocturnal surveys in progress. Coordination for potential translocation sites on BLM lands ongoing. Habitat improvements coordinated and conducted at one new translocation site on BLM {{lands in the}} Gold Butte; site scheduled to receive frogs in April. All milestones and deliverables associated with the MSHCP project on schedule. Project 2. Bald Eagle Winter Monitoring and Evaluation Winter bald eagle count successfully completed, largest count ever (116 confirmed bald eagle sightings, not counting unidentified and golden eagles). Annual Work Plan and Detailed Timelines for the associated MSHCP projects completed; all MSHCP milestones and deliverables on schedule. Project 3. Peregrine Falcon Monitoring and Evaluation Peregrine falcon monitoring activities initiated. New call-broadcast methodology under evaluation, results promising. Work plan and detailed timelines for the associated MSHCP projects completed ahead of schedule – on schedule for all MSHCP milestones and deliverables. Project 4. Assessment of Six Covered and Three Evaluation Bird Species Work on thrasher modeling ongoing. Intensive area search plots identified for MSHCP projects. Field protocols associated with MSHCP project completed; on schedule for all MSHCP milestones and deliverables. Surveys initiated early at one intensive area site to evaluate thrasher-breeding activity. Undergraduate student hired part-time this spring to assist with intensive area surveys. Project 5. Desert Tortoise Monitoring and Management. Efforts for this project have been completed under this task agreement (as modified). Project 6. Shorebird Monitoring on Lakes Mead and Mohave Twenty-one surveys of regularly monitored sites on Lakes Mead and Mohave conducted this quarter; five additional surveys conducted. Surveys within Black Canyon to count all aquatic birds from Willow Beach to Hoover Dam initiated on a monthly basis. Project 7.

5000|$|Walkie-talkies {{are widely}} used in any setting where {{portable}} radio communications are necessary, including business, public safety, military, outdoor recreation, and the like, and devices are available at numerous price points from inexpensive analog units sold as toys up to ruggedized (i.e. waterproof or intrinsically safe) analog and digital units for use on boats or in heavy industry. Most countries allow the sale of walkie-talkies for, at least, business, marine communications, and some limited personal uses such as CB radio, {{as well as for}} amateur radio designs. Walkie-talkies, thanks to increasing use of miniaturized electronics, can be made very small, with some personal two-way UHF radio models being smaller than a deck of cards (though <b>VHF</b> and HF <b>units</b> can be substantially larger due to the need for larger antennas and battery packs). In addition, as costs come down, it is possible to add advanced squelch capabilities such as CTCSS (analog squelch) and DCS (digital squelch) (often marketed as [...] "privacy codes") to inexpensive radios, as well as voice scrambling and trunking capabilities. Some units (especially amateur HTs) also include DTMF keypads for remote operation of various devices such as repeaters. Some models include VOX capability for hands-free operation, as well as the ability to attach external microphones and speakers.|$|R
