6000|$|A resolution, {{which had}} passed the Board of the Executive Government of Bengal, for {{altering}} the mode of paying the salaries of the judges, produced from him a very spirited remonstrance. The affair, however, {{seems to have been}} misconceived by himself and his brethren on the Bench; and on its being explained the usual harmony was restored. At the commencement of 1786, while this matter was pending, he made a voyage to Chatigan, the boundary of the British dominions in Bengal towards the east. In this [...] "Indian Montpelier," [...] where he describes [...] "the hillocks covered with pepper vines, and sparkling with blossoms of the coffee tree," [...] in addition to his other literary researches he twice perused the poem of Ferdausi, consisting of above sixty thousand couplets. This he considered to be an epic poem as majestic and entire as the Iliad; and thought the outline of it related to a single hero, Khosrau, (the Cyrus of Herodotus and Xenophon), whom, as he says, [...] "the Asiaticks, conversing with the Father of European History, described according to their popular traditions by his true name, which the Greek alphabet could not express." [...] A nearer acquaintance with the great epic bard of Persia had now taught him therefore to retract the assertion he had made in his Commentary on Asiatic Poetry, that [...] "the hero, as it is called, of the poem, was that well known Hercules of the Persians, named Rustem; although there are several other heroes, or warriors, to each of whom their own particular glory is assigned." [...] At the time of writing this, he had an intention, if leisure should be allowed him, of translating the whole work. A version of Ferdausi, either in verse unfettered by rhyme, or in such numerous prose as the prophetical parts of the Bible are translated into, would, I think, be the most <b>valuable</b> <b>transfer</b> that our language is now capable of receiving from foreign tongues.|$|E
40|$|While {{bigger and}} deeper neural network {{architectures}} continue {{to advance the}} state-of-the-art for many computer vision tasks, real-world adoption of these networks is impeded by hardware and speed constraints. Conventional model compression methods attempt {{to address this problem}} by modifying the architecture manually or using pre-defined heuristics. Since the space of all reduced architectures is very large, modifying the architecture of a deep neural network in this way is a difficult task. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing a principled method for learning reduced network architectures in a data-driven way using reinforcement learning. Our approach takes a larger `teacher' network as input and outputs a compressed `student' network derived from the `teacher' network. In the first stage of our method, a recurrent policy network aggressively removes layers from the large `teacher' model. In the second stage, another recurrent policy network carefully reduces the size of each remaining layer. The resulting network is then evaluated to obtain a reward [...] a score based on the accuracy and compression of the network. Our approach uses this reward signal with policy gradients to train the policies to find a locally optimal student network. Our experiments show that we can achieve compression rates of more than 10 x for models such as ResNet- 34 while maintaining similar performance to the input `teacher' network. We also present a <b>valuable</b> <b>transfer</b> learning result which shows that policies which are pre-trained on smaller `teacher' networks can be used to rapidly speed up training on larger `teacher' networks...|$|E

40|$|The Fire Effects Planning Framework (FEPF), {{developed}} under JFSP project (99 - 1 - 3 - 16) “Wildland fuels management: evaluating {{and planning}} risks and benefits,” was formally completed in June 2004. FEPF {{is a logical}} framework that uses available data (e. g., local, LANDFIRE data) and existing software (e. g., GIS, Farsite, FlamMap, expert knowledge) to produce maps of probable fire effects during the pre-season or in advance of a fire front. The initial project included significant technology transfer activities. As that project concluded, however, we continued to receive requests for assistance from field managers (District, Forest and Regional Forest Service offices), international organizations (Interior West Fire Council), and national fire planning organizations (Fire Program Analysis). These requests sought {{more information about the}} tool, assistance with using it for hazardous fuels planning, and guidance for incorporating FEPF into regional training courses. To enable us to continue our outreach efforts, we initiated JFSP 05 - 4 - 1 - 20 “Extending the reach of the the Fire Effects Planning Framework by taking a critical approach to science delivery and application”. This funding allowed us to meet requests for assistance and participation while allowing us to identify and concentrate on the most <b>valuable</b> <b>transfer</b> mechanisms. Our goal was to observe how field managers think about and use the tool, learn who they think the primary audience is, and then revise our materials and activities accordingly. FEPF is the only analysis tool we know of that helps managers (land and fire) articulate probable ecologic effects of fire and integrate these into fire decision-making and assessment. The technology and data used by FEPF is widely available. The scientific basis for crosswalk determinations are grounded in best available science, transparent, and easily updated as new information becomes available. As the federal fire agencies move toward more comprehensive implementation of Appropriate Management Response, FEPF remains the only process that can quickly and consistently indicate areas and conditions where fire may be neutral, beneficial or harmful to natural resources of interest. Thus, it provides the only existing process to link emergency fire operations (from full suppression to wildland fire use) with land management plans, a requirement of federal oversight entities (e. g., OIG) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{scientific}} knowledge {{of climate change}} processes and their worrying future implications for human societies and natural systems has developed considerably during the last decade, but necessary adaptive actions by decision makers have so far been rather limited. There are several causes to this, such as a discrepancy related to the communication between climate scientists and end-users, {{and the lack of}} climate educational background of several decision makers. This results in decision makers not fully incorporating knowledge on climate change and impacts into adaptive action measures. Hence, educating future decision makers, as well as scientists providing the climate knowledge, is therefore highly important in order to minimise this reduction of knowledge transfer, and by so improve the necessary decision processes of climate actions. Here we report how the Department of Physical Geography and Ecosystem Sciences, and the Centre for Environmental and Climate Research at Lund University, work on continuously improving climate communication skills of our Masters students. Throughout the academic programs with Masters in Physical Geography and Ecosystem Analysis, and in Climate Strategy, our students have mixed educational background (ranging from meteorologists to geographers, from biologists to engineers as well as political science students) which generates a unique classroom environment for learning communication across borders of different understanding and knowledge background. Here we present interesting outcomes of such a set-up, including work hands-on with issues related to climate change, impacts and adaptation through exercises, seminars and projects. Students learn how to systematically treat background climate information and carefully analyse their results, and to efficiently communicate their findings through written reports and oral presentations. Teachers provide formative constructive feedback on assignments throughout the programs, for students to improve their subject knowledge and understanding as well as their communication performance. To further motivate our students, external professionals from enterprises and authorities working on climate related issues are frequently invited as guest lecturers, which also may act as co-supervisors of degree projects. These networks also contribute to <b>valuable</b> <b>transfer</b> of {{scientific knowledge}} between our departments and the non-academia world. Furthermore, teachers are encouraged to develop their own communication skills by e. g. attend tailored pedagogic courses and conferences. Our Master programs provide a highly stimulating learning environment in which students are trained to become effective communicators of climate related knowledge, being able to critically analyse climate information, impact probabilities, and adaptation strategies, and thereby to take on the role as decision makers...|$|E
40|$|Techniques for hiding {{proceeds}} of crime include transporting cash out of the country, purchasing businesses through which funds can be channeled, buying easily transportable <b>valuables,</b> <b>transfer</b> pricing, and using “underground banks. ” Since the mid‐ 1980 s, governments and law enforcement have developed an increasingly global, intrusive, and routinized set of measures to affect criminal revenues passing through the financial system.

Available data weakly suggest that the anti–money laundering (AML) regime has not had major effects in suppressing crimes. The regime does facilitate investigation and prosecution of some criminal participants who would otherwise evade justice, but fewer than expected by advocates of “follow the money” methods. It also permits the readier recovery of funds from core criminals and from financial intermediaries. However, the volume is very slight compared with income or even profits from crime. Though the regime also targets terrorist finances, modern terrorists need little money for their operations. AML controls are unlikely to cut off their funds but may yield useful intelligence.

40|$|Abstract: Transferring data {{between two}} points is very crucial, also for some vital {{applications}} {{the precision of}} the transferred data is extremely important, however an error throughout the transmission of data is awfully familiar [1]. Error correcting codes are very <b>valuable</b> in <b>transfer</b> information over lengthy distances or through channels where errors might {{take place in the}} message.

Reed–Muller codes are a family of linear error correcting codes used in communications [2]. For bit error correction, the Reed-Muller code is one of the efficient algorithms, on the other hand, its high-computation prerequisite innate in the decoding process interdict its use in handy applications [3]. This paper describes a new method to detect and correct a single bit in the data message using Reed Muller matrix. The aim is to provide error-free information through transmitting and receiving by detection and correction a single bit in a big data very efficiently. The design detects and corrects all single bit errors in a 16, 32, 64, 128 bit data, and used 4, 5, 6, 7 check bits respectively.

The calf displayed several characteristics associated with Large Offspring Syndrome, including fetal edema (mild), large birthweight, persistent tachypnea, and large umbilical vessels. Large Offspring Syndrome is frequently attributed to techniques of nuclear transfer, in vitro fertilization, and less commonly, multiple ovulation embryo transfer.

The benefit from investing in ventures was therefore largely independent of their commercial success. Furthermore, estimation of success rates proved highly sensitive to the stage of the ventures at which sampling began. These findings suggest the need to reconceptualize the notion of early stage ventures and their success. We further found that the venturing process can be conceptualized as a nested system of simultaneous selection at both the venture and the capability level. We show that these selection processes are distinct yet operate in a coevolutionary way and are amenable to proactive management...|$|R
40|$|Although {{responsible}} {{for only a}} relatively {{small fraction of the}} CAPEX, transfer towers and chutes are often {{responsible for}} significant challenges and down-time in the operation of ore processing plants and port facilities. In the past, these critical components of the conveying system have been designed using standard tests and methods, which do not appropriately describe the dynamics of the motion of the particles over the range of conditions found in operation. One significant tool that has evolved during recent decades to aid in designing these components is Discrete Element Method (DEM). DEM Solutions Ltd. (Edinburgh, UK) has made this method commercially available in the software package EDEM BulkSim 2 ̆ 2. EDEM allows design engineers to gain <b>valuable</b> insight into <b>transfer</b> chute performance using a desktop computer. The paper demonstrates the importance of EDEM Material Model Calibration to produce representative, bulk material handling simulations in EDEM BulkSim by presenting a case study on a problematic transfer chute used for handling iron ore products at a port facility...|$|R
