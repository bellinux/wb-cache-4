50|$|Offered at Lexus' Japanese {{domestic}} market launch in 2005, G-Link is the proprietary Lexus telematics {{system for the}} Japanese market. G-Link has a different software configuration versus G-Book, particularly in its link to the 24-hour Lexus Owner's Desk hotline, and is offered standard {{for the first three}} years of ownership. Other aspects of the system at its 2005 launch were based on G-Book Alpha capabilities. The G-Link software runs off of the vehicle's hard disc drive navigation system and song library, and includes traffic updates, HelpNet compatibility, and the G-Security service. The G-Security service includes cellphone notification of <b>vehicle</b> <b>lock</b> and position status. A G-Sound music distribution service offers samples and downloading to the vehicle's hard disc drive of MP3s from different genres. A U.S. equivalent of the G-Link system with similar but not identical functionality, called Lexus Enform with Safety Connect, was launched in 2009.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how {{to decide}} {{a path for}} a vehicle {{to move to the}} destination. A space where vehicles move around is composed of space objects. The objects are structured in a hierarchical tree named a space tree. Objects at a higher level denote broader area than ones at a lower level in the space tree. In this paper, we present a method for each vehicle to decide a path whose part nearer to the vehicle is more detailed, and whose part which is farther from the vehicle is broader. A broader path means that it includes objects at higher level. Also, we model movement of the vehicle as an open nested transaction. Each <b>vehicle</b> <b>locks</b> objects in a decided path before passing through them at a level depending on the distance from the <b>vehicle.</b> The <b>vehicle</b> <b>locks</b> more strongly the object nearer to it. The strongness of the lock on the object represents how surely the vehicle can pass through the object. Also, we discuss the deadlock problem among multiple vehicles. 1 Introduction In con [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Background {{and aims}}   Occupational {{diseases}} impose considerable burden on public health, wherein chemical pollutants in working places {{play an important}} role. One of chemical pollutants  in <b>vehicle's</b> <b>lock</b> & key assembly factories is cyanoacrylate used in" loctite glue", which is assumed harmful to workers' eyes, respiratory tract and skin. This study investigates {{the side effects of}} loctite adhesive on workers' health.   Methods   Across sectional study was conducted on all of workers of the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>lock</b> & key  assembly factory (100 workers). A health check list was completed for demographic   characteristics, and physical examination for all of workers and then all data were analysed using  statistical tests.   Results   Mean age of workers was 30 ± 8. In physical exam, the most common dermatologic  disease was dermatitis (prevalence: 25 %), in pulmonary exam the most common sign was airway hyper-responsiveness, which presented as cough and dispnea (prevalence: 10 %) and there was a significant relationship between workers' eye itching & burning, airway hyper-responsiveness  and loctite adhesive exposure (P< 0. 01).   Conclusion   Eye itching & burning and airway hyper-responsiveness are side effects of loctite  glue. In this study we observed a relationship between the glue and disorders, hence due to the influence of this chemical material on workers' health. Results indicated that a health promotion   plan and relevant interventions should be designed to reduce exposure to loctite adhesive...|$|R

40|$|Abstract─Our {{paper is}} termed the Autonomous <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Locking</b> System – A Smart Door Lock. The two main {{objectives}} are to unlock {{a set of}} vehicle doors when the owner approaches his or her <b>vehicle</b> and to <b>lock</b> the <b>vehicle</b> after the owner leaves. In order to design this system, the establishment of wireless communication between the vehicle owner and their vehicle is required. The wireless transmission must ensure vehicle security and also be reliable in various climates. Overall, the total power dissipated needs to be low to account {{that it will be}} on for long periods to time. This project was selected because this was a functionality that everybody would like to see implemented. This system is intended to provide added convenience to the vehicle owner. The object {{of this paper is to}} implement a low-power system where the customer will be granted access to his locked car as he approaches the vehicle. With such a system, the advantages of keyless access will be accomplished with only passive involvement from the client...|$|R
50|$|Intended for the {{flagship}} W221 S-Class and the W216 CL-Class, COMAND NTG3 is a high-end system. Unlike for most other Mercedes-Benz cars, the S-Class and CL-Class {{from now on}} have COMAND as standard, allowing even better integration and for COMAND to operate even more vehicle functions. The navigation maps are stored on an internal hard disk instead of a DVD disc (although updates are installed from an update DVD). In addition to operating the audio, video, navigation and telecommunication systems, the NTG3 COMAND also controls {{a host of other}} features, such as the multi-contour and drive-dynamic seats, the HVAC system, the rear window shade, the <b>vehicle</b> <b>locking,</b> alarm and immobiliser, interior and exterior lighting functions, the optional ambient lighting feature, easy entry/exit settings, etc.|$|R

50|$|The S band is a {{designation}} by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for {{a part of}} {{the microwave}} band of the electromagnetic spectrum covering frequencies from 2 to 4 gigahertz (GHz). Thus it crosses the conventional boundary between the UHF and SHF bands at 3.0 GHz. The S band is used by weather radar, surface ship radar, and some communications satellites, especially those used by NASA to communicate with the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. The 10 cm radar short-band ranges roughly from 1.55 to 5.2 GHz. The S band also contains the 2.4-2.483 GHz ISM band, widely used for low power unlicensed microwave devices such as cordless phones, wireless headphones (Bluetooth), wireless networking (WiFi), garage door openers, keyless <b>vehicle</b> <b>locks,</b> baby monitors as well as for medical diathermy machines and microwave ovens (typically at 2.495GHz).|$|R

50|$|This is the {{simplest}} type of skid, where directional changes are not relevant, and the <b>vehicle</b> merely <b>locks</b> up the tires moving forwards {{in a straight}} line.

40|$|The {{real-time}} {{change of}} tire-road friction coefficient {{is one of}} the important factors that influence vehicle safety performance. Besides, the <b>vehicle</b> wheels’ <b>locking</b> up has become an important issue. In order to solve these problems, this paper comes up with a novel slip control of electric vehicle (EV) based on tire-road friction coefficient estimation. First and foremost, a novel method is proposed to estimate the tire-road friction coefficient, and then the reference slip ratio is determined based on the estimation results. Finally, with the reference slip ratio, a slip control based on model predictive control (MPC) is designed to prevent the <b>vehicle</b> wheels from <b>locking</b> up. In this regard, the proposed controller guarantees the optimal braking torque on each wheel by individually controlling the slip ratio of each tire within the stable zone. Theoretical analyses and simulation show that the proposed controller is effective for better braking performance...|$|R
40|$|This Ph. D. {{thesis is}} aimed at {{analyzing}} vehicle dynamics in presence of an electronically controlled limited-slip differential and at developing advanced control strategies for the limited-slip differential of sports cars, {{in order to improve}} performance, stability and safety. A critical review of the concept of understeer-oversteer for <b>vehicles</b> with <b>locked</b> differential is first presented. The steady-state directional behaviour of rear-wheel drive <b>vehicles</b> fitted with <b>locked</b> differential is theoretically analyzed. Furthermore, the problem of describing the understeer-oversteer behaviour of a general vehicle is addressed taking a fresh perspective, since the new concept of handling surface and a new definition of understeer gradient are presented, this latter being the gradient of the handling surface. The problem of controlling vehicle dynamics by means of electronically controlled limited-slip differentials is then approached. The main handling control problems for sports cars fitted with controlled limited-slip differential are analyzed in detail. An advanced control strategy, developed for the rear electronically controlled limited-slip differential of F 1 race cars, is also described...|$|R
