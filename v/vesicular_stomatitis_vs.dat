40|$|We {{propose a}} reclasification of five {{strains of the}} New Jersey {{serotype}} of vesicular stomatitis virus into two subtypes designated Concan and Hazelhurst. This subclassification into two subtypes is based on reciprocal differences in antibody neutralization of virion infectivity, nucleotide base sequence homology, oligonucleotide maps of virion RNA, and interference by defective-interfering particles. <b>Vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> (<b>VS)</b> viruses, the proto-type members of the rhabdovirus group (20), were originally isolated during widespread out-breaks of disease in cattle, horses, and swine (8).

40|$|There are {{two major}} {{vesicular}} (blister) diseases of cattle, {{foot and mouth disease}} (FMD) and <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> (<b>VS).</b> However, there are several diseases that can cause lesions similar to those that occur with ruptured vesicles. The most important diseases of that group are bovine viral diarrhea (BVD), bluetongue, malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), and bovine papular stomatitis. Two of the diseases, FMD and MCF, are foreign animal diseases in the United States and all but papular stomatitis are reportable in Utah.

40|$|Neuraminidase free of {{proteolytic}} activity substantially {{reduced the}} infectivity of <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> (<b>VS)</b> virus but less effectively than trypsin. The only sugar residue hydrolyzed by neuraminidase was N-acetyl neuraminic acid, ∼ 89 % {{of which was}} liberated from virion glycoprotein and the rest from virion glycolipid. Desialylation of virion glycoprotein but not of glycolipid resulted in progressive loss of infectivity. Sialyl transferase prepared and partially purified from BHK- 21 cells catalyzed resialylation by CMP-[14 C]sialic acid of the glycoprotein of neuraminidase-treated VS virions and supersialylation of unhydrolyzed VS viral glycoprotein.

40|$|<b>Vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> is an {{important}} livestock disease endemic in the Americas. This zoonotic viral disease is characterized by vesicles, erosions and ulcers on the mouth, feet and udder. Pain, anorexia and secondary mastitis can cause decreased productivity in all species, and swine infected with some viruses may die. Although <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> is endemic in limited areas of the southeastern United States, these viruses have not caused outbreaks in livestock since the 1970 s. Epidemics in the Southwest are typically caused by newly introduced viruses, which usually disappear after 1 - 2 years. Affected herds are quarantined until the disease has run its course. <b>Vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> closely resembles three vesicular diseases exotic to the U. S. : foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease, and vesicular exanthema of swine. Differentiation of these diseases is important, as a wrong diagnosis could mask the spread of an exotic disease. Prompt diagnosis is also important in containing outbreaks of <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis,</b> which can restrict international trade. Etiology <b>Vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus (VSV) {{is a member of}} the genus Vesiculovirus in the family Rhabdoviridae. The two major serotypes are New Jersey and Indiana. Currently, four viruses are known to cause <b>vesicular</b> stomatitis: <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> Indiana virus (VSV-IN; formerly known as the Indiana 1 subtype of VSV), <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> New Jersey virus (VSV-NJ), <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> Alagoas virus (VSV-AV; formerly Indiana 3) and Cocal virus (formerly Indiana 2). The genus Vesiculovirus also contains related viruses (such as Piry virus) which have been isolated from animals, humans and/or arthropods and may cause vesicles after experimental inoculation. Species Affected <b>Vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> mainly affects horses, donkeys, mules, cattle and swine. South American camelids, sheep and goats occasionally have clinical signs.

It was demonstrated that L protein, but not NS protein, was required for in vitro RNA synthesis on the VS viral nucleocapsid template. Solubilized L protein rebinds to the ribonucleoprotein template when the transcription complex is reconstituted, and the RNA synthesized in vitro by purified L protein hybridizes to virion RNA. Cyanogen bromide peptide fingerprints indicate that the large L protein is a unique polypeptide chain. It is concluded that the L protein functions as the transcriptase, and the nucleocapsid NS protein is not essential for in vitro RNA synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Digitonin, a sterol {{glycoside}} which complexes with cholesterol, {{stripped off}} the envelope of <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> (<b>VS)</b> virions and liberated two viral structural proteins, 83 % of P 6 and 53 % of P 4. Deoxycholate also disrupted VS virions but released nucleocapsid cores {{which could be}} identified by higher buoyant density, ratio of incorporated 3 H-uridine to 14 C-protein, and electron microscopy. The major nucleocapsid protein was P 5 but varying amounts of the minor protein aggregate P 2 were present, depending on the concentration of urea used for extraction. P 2 {{appeared to be a}} polymer of P 5. Two other minor structural proteins, P 1 and P 3, could not be located in the virion.

40|$|An {{endogenous}} transcriptase inhibitor {{active at}} {{high concentrations of}} <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> (<b>VS)</b> virus was present in trypsinized whole virions but was absent from ribonucleoprotein cores containing only the L, N, and NS proteins.

Two group III temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of VS virus (tsO 23 and ts G 31) with lesions in the M protein exhibited little or no endogenous inhibitor activity compared with two wild-type strains and a group V mutant (tsO 45) with a lesion in the G protein.

40|$|Recently {{accumulated}} knowledge allows more precise {{comparison of the}} structural (and possibly evolutionary) relationships of several different animal rhabdoviruses: <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus, rabies virus, Kern Canyon virus, and spring viremia of carp virus. Each virus is composed primarily of a glycoprotein, an RNA-associated nucleoprotein, {{and one or two}} membrane proteins. <b>Vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus group viruses contain lesser amounts of two additional distinct polypeptides, NS and L. The separate viruses undergo structural polypeptide phosphorylation in vivo according to characteristic patterns. In <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus the NS protein is selectively phosphorylated. In rabies group viruses and in spring viremia of carp virus, the nucleoprotein is the predominant phosphoprotein; in these viruses only the phosphorylated moiety is selectively cleaved off with trypsin. In Kern Canyon virus, only membrane protein and glycoprotein are weakly phosphorylated. Each virus possesses a virion-bound protein kinase. <b>Vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus group viruses, Kern Canyon virus, and spring viremia of carp virus only contain virion-bound transcriptases of respectively decreasing levels of activity demonstrable in vitro. <b>Vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> and Kern Canyon viruses replicate efficiently in enucleated cells; rabies virus does not. Based upon these observations, it is suggested that <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus may represent the most highly evolved of these rhabdoviruses, whereas spring viremia of carp and Kern Canyon viruses may represent "evolutionary links" between the <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> and rabies virus groups...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Vesicular {{stomatitis}} {{virus was}} released exponentially and fairly reproducibly after infecting chick embryo cell monolayers. This system appeared suitable for chemical studies, which {{are to be}} presented separately; the present paper is concerned with growth-curve methods and {{a discussion of the}} system. When the average multiplicity of adsorption was 6 plaque-forming units/cell the latent period was 1 - 2 hr., and growth appeared to follow a one-step cycle. At least 62 - 75 yo of the cells were capable of releasing virus. This paper is intended to show that <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> (<b>VS)</b> virus growing in chick embryo-cell monolayers is a suitable system for quantitative study. It describes the conditions used in such studies, the results of which are to be presented separately (Cooper, 1957 a, b).

40|$|Interaction with excess unilamellar {{phosphatidylcholine}} (PC) vesicles {{resulted in}} depletion {{of as much}} as 90 % of the cholesterol from the membrane of intact <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> (<b>VS)</b> virus. The cholesterol depletion was not significantly influenced by the proteolytic removal of virion glycoprotein spikes, but it was temperature dependent. Cholesterol depletion caused substantial reduction in anisotropy of the VS virion membrane as measured by fluorescence depolarization of the lipophilic probe 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene; residual adsorbed vesicles represent a significant factor in this apparent increase in virion membrane fluidity. Interaction with PC vesicles resulted in a substantial loss of VS viral infectivity as measured by plating efficiency on L-cell monolayers. Reduction in infectivity appeared to be related to temperature-dependent depletion of virion cholesterol by PC vesicles. Interaction of VS virions with cholesterol-containing PC vesicles resulted in significantly less decline in infectivity, but attempts to restore cholesterol and infectivity to depleted VS virions were unsuccessful. Depletion of virion cholesterol apparently results through collision with PC vesicles rather than movement of cholesterol monomers or micelles through the aqueous phase, because PC vesicle-virion interaction in the presence of cholesterol oxidase did not result in substantial oxidation of translocated cholesterol...|$|E
40|$|Exposure of <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> (<b>VS)</b> virions to {{neuraminidase}} {{resulted in}} {{loss of their}} ability to agglutinate goose erythrocytes and to attach to L cells concomitant with hydrolysis of sialic acid. These viral adsorptive functions were also destroyed by tryspsinization. Sialyl transferase resialylation in vitro of neuraminidase-treated VS virions restored their hamagglutinating and adsorptive functions almost to original levels. Erythrocyte and L cell receptors for attachment of VS virions were blocked by fully sialylated fetuin and by VS viral sialoglycopeptides. Smaller VS viral glycopeptides generated by extensive trypsinization were less effective inhibitors of hemagglutination than were larger glycopeptides; neuraminic acid and neuraminosyl lactose had no capacity to inhibit hamagglutination or adsorption of virus to L cells. These data suggest that cellular receptors for viral adsorption recognize sialoglycopeptides of a certain size. Neuraminidase desialylation did not significantly alter the isoelectric point of VS virions. Cells exposed to DEAE-dextran, trypsin, or neuraminidase showed significantly increased capacity to attach fully sialylated but not desialylated VS virions. Neuraminidase desialylation of L cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells resulted in enhanced susceptibility to plaque formation by VS virus...|$|E

The specificity of anti-RNPInd serum was demonstrated by selective precipitation of homotypic RNPInd devoid of L and NS proteins; anti-RNPInd serum also selectively precipitated soluble N protein present in cytoplasm of infected cells, but co-precipitated {{a limited amount of}} contaminating soluble NS protein. Immunoglobulins prepared from each homotypic antiserum markedly inhibited in vitro transcription of VSInd and VSNJ virions. Anti-RNPInd and anti-RNPNJ immunoglobulins also exhibited cross-reactivity by inhibiting transcription of heterotypic virions, but only to a much lesser degree than in the homotypic reaction. Anti-RNPInd immunoglobulin did not inhibit transcription of the antigenically unrelated Chandipura rhabdovirus, but anti-RNPNJ immunoglobulin did to a very limited extent. The transcription inhibitory activity of anti-RNPInd immunoglobulin was not dependent on RNP immunoprecipitation activity, which could be diluted out well before loss of antitranscriptase activity. Anti-RNPind immunoglobulin appeared to exert its effect on transcription by blocking elongation rather than initiation or reinitiation of RNA transcripts...|$|E
40|$|A highly {{purified}} rabbit interferon {{was tested}} for {{its capacity to}} inhibit various manifestations of infection of primary rabbit kidney (RK) cells with <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> (<b>VS)</b> virus. A kinetic analysis of the actinomycin-sensitive phase of interferon-induced cellular resistance revealed that RK cells could transcribe {{virtually all of the}} hypothetical antiviral messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) within 3 hr. Similar exposure to interferon reduced virus yield by 95 to 99 % and markedly inhibited cytopathic effect on RK cells infected at a multiplicity of 10 or less. Interferon was less effective in blocking cytopathic effects when RK cells were infected at a multiplicity of 100. However, RK cells pretreated with the same amount of interferon and infected at a multiplicity of 100 failed to incorporate 3 H-amino acids into structural or nonstructural proteins of VS virus identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Despite this inhibition of viral protein synthesis, interferon did not prevent the switch off by VS virus of cellular protein synthesis. The rapidity with which a high multiplicity of VS virus switched off cellular protein synthesis, even in cells rendered resistant to viral infection by interferon, is further evidence that this reaction is caused by an infecting virion component rather than by a newly synthesized viral product...|$|E

The virion kinase preferentially phosphorylated the nucleocapsid NS protein in vitro {{and to a lesser extent}} the envelope M protein.

Partial evidence that the virion kinase is of cellular origin was obtained by finding reduced enzyme activity in virions released from cells pretreated with actinomycin D and cycloheximide. Selective detergent and detergent-salt fractionation of VS virions revealed that the kinase activity was present in the envelope but not the spikes. The virion kinase activity in a Triton-salt-solubilized envelope fraction could be separated from M and G proteins and partially purified by phosphocellulose column chromatography.

While distinct from VSV-NJ strains causing previous outbreaks in the western United States and those circulating in feral swine in the southeastern United States, this lineage was closely related to viral lineages circulating in the Mexican states of Guerrero, Veracruz, and Oaxaca in 1996, 1989, and 1984 respectively. In 1997 and 1998, VSV serotype Indiana 1 (IN 1) re-emerged in the western United States after 30 years. Viruses causing these outbreaks grouped within a single genetic lineage distinct from VSV-IN 1 isolates causing outbreaks in the western United States in 1929 and 1956 but closely related to a strain circulating {{in the state of}} Colima in central Mexico in 1997. Our data showed that sporadic VS outbreaks in the western United States are caused by genetically distinct viral lineages closer to those circulating in enzootic areas of central and southern Mexico than to those causing previous outbreaks in the United States.

40|$|Early {{stages of}} the entry of <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> (<b>VS)</b> virus into L cells were {{followed}} by electron microscopy {{with the aid of}} ferritin antibody labeling. Cells which were infected at 0 C and incubated for 10 min at 37 C were reacted first with antiviral-antiferritin hybrid antibody and then with ferritin or fluorescein-labeled apoferritin. Extensive ferritin labeling of the cell surface was detected by both electron and fluorescence microscopy. The labeled regions of the cell surface were continuous with and indistinguishable {{from the rest of the}} host cell membrane, suggesting incorporation of viral antigens into the cell surface during viral penetration. Fusion of parental viral membrane with host cell membrane was further demonstrated by examining the localization of 3 H-labeled viral structural proteins in cells infected at 0 C and incubated for short periods at 37 C. Viral nucleoprotein was found in a soluble fraction of the cells which was derived primarily from the cytoplasm, whereas a particulate fraction from the cells was enriched in viral envelope proteins. Cytoplasmic membrane was isolated from these cells, and this membrane contained viral envelope proteins.

40|$|Vesicular {{stomatitis}} virus of the New Jersey serotype (VSV-NJ) causes vesicular {{disease in}} cattle, pigs, and horses throughout the Americas. Vesicular disease is clinically indistinguishable from foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Therefore, outbreaks of vesicular disease in FMD-free areas must be rapidly diagnosed by laboratory methods and affected farms must be quarantined until laboratory results confirm {{the absence of}} FMD. Diagnosis is currently performed in high-containment (biosafety level 3) laboratories by using complement fixation and virus isolation in tissue culture. We describe here an alternative method {{for the detection of}} VSV-NJ RNA in clinical samples. This method includes a rapid acid guanidine-phenol RNA extraction procedure coupled with a one-tube polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using reverse transcriptase. By using this test, we were able to detect the largest number of positive samples (53 of 58), followed by complement (48 of 58) and isolation in tissue culture (43 of 58). The primers chosen for this assay amplify a 642 -nucleotide region of the phosphoprotein gene of VSV-NJ but not of VSV-IN. Sequencing of the PCR product enables genetic typing of virus isolates and epidemiological studies.
