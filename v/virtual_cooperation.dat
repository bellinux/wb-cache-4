40|$|Technology {{advances}} in ICT have permitted an increased {{flow of information}} across borders, and increasingly companies are moving to so-called virtual alliances. The business relationships between Dutch and Chinese companies are becoming closer by ways of outsourcing, new market development and so on. The new <b>virtual</b> <b>cooperation</b> form has brought opportunities for companies in various sectors {{in the two countries}} to conduct business easily at low cost. However, despite the advantages, few pure virtual alliances had been found, and the usage of ICT systems in Dutch-Chinese business contexts is still at a relatively low level. This paper presents the concept of international virtual alliance, including the terms of virtuality, virtualness, and degree of virtuality. After presenting a general <b>virtual</b> <b>cooperation</b> model, two cases involving Dutch-Chinese business cooperation are described.

In this paper we investigate micro-political processes—i. e. informal actions of individual actors to gain power and exert influence, which is a well-researched concept in traditional organizations—with respect to inter-organizational networks. By means of a qualitative interview study we investigated structures and strategies of power within virtual networks. Results show that micro-political tactics known from research in traditional organizations are also used in inter-organizational settings. Furthermore, we identified additional micro-political tactics specific to virtual networks. The latter are especially related to the use of ICT.

40|$|In {{this work}} we analyze the {{evolving}} dynamics of different collaboration network strategies {{that emerge from}} the creation and diffusion of knowledge. In addition, we aim at describing their most relevant network properties over time. An evolutionary economic approach has been adopted by avoiding the profit-maximization behavior of firms and introducing decision rules that are applied routinely. A Multi-Agent Model with cognitive attributes where agents learn {{to make their own}} decisions has been developed. Firms (the agents) can collaborate and create networks for Research and Development (R&D) purposes. We have compared five collaboration strategies (A - Peer-to-Peer complementariness, B –Concentration process, C –Reinforcement Strategy, D - Virtual Collaboration Networks and E - <b>Virtual</b> <b>Cooperation</b> Networks) that were defined on the basis of literature and on empirical evidence. Strategies are introduced exogenously in the simulation. The aims of this paper are threefold: (i) to analyze the importance of the networking effects; (ii) to test the differences among collaboration strategies; and, finally, (iii) to verify the effect of learning. It has been possible to conclude that profit is associated with higher stock of knowledge and with smaller network diameter. In addition, concentration strategies are more profitable and more efficient in transmitting knowledge through the network. These processes reinforce the stock of knowledge and the profit of the firms located in the centers of the networks. Such dynamics is supported by the learning mechanism that generates a kind of collective cognition: in fact, if more firms connect to a particular network, then the center of the network is reinforced, producing feedbacks to all nodes.

40|$|The didactic {{model of}} remote internships {{described}} in this study provides the flexibility needed to support networked learners, i. e. to facilitate the development and subsequent assessment of their competences. The heterogeneity of the participants (students, employers, tutors) in the learning network provides relevant diversity in expert perspectives. In today’s (networked) business environment, ever more collaboration takes place through virtual platforms and tools. Learning for Sustainable Development could profit from the opportunities such platforms offer, as part of it. Taken from the Brundtland Report (1987), Sustainable Development is development that "meets {{the needs of the}} present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. Sustainable Development has a high level of complexity, with its need for integration of socio-political, environmental and economic perspectives, its uncertainty in future and its dedication to an enormous range of levels of scale, acting from local to global. Because of the complexity of the concept, the defining of competences and learning outcomes for Sustainable Development is not easy. Learning for Sustainable Development could be described as obtaining the ability to cross the boundaries between multiple perspectives in interaction with stakeholders and actors in sustainability issues. An authentic example on the Dutch-Flemish Scheldt Estuary debate, described in the present study, shows such different perspectives and how they influence the scientific study of and decision-making on sustainability issues. We argue how learners who have to deal with these kinds of different perspectives will develop their personal competences in an effective way. The didactic model of remote internships that we use, allows learners to work in virtual teams on current, authentic research assignments in contact with their customers: real employers in the professional field. Moreover, the didactic model enables learners to define their own activities according to their personal learning goals matching the external requirements of employer and university. This allows our learners - adult distance students at the formal BSc Environmental Sciences programme (Open Universiteit) - to start from their own unique perspectives, having different prior knowledge, in different learning domains and from different professional experiences. The multiple perspectives show themselves in the practice of <b>virtual</b> <b>cooperation</b> with peers and experts from both the academic and professional community. Thus, the present study explores how an online remote internship model can effectively support competence development in a heterogeneous professional learning network...|$|E

This paper describes today’s use of ICT (situation as-is) in Swedish multi-storey house-building projects and identifies a number of key development areas. The research was carried out through steps includ-ing statistical analyses of market data, a case study, a survey with active developers working with R&D in the field of ICT and workshops with construction industry representatives and researchers. Typically, Swedish multi-storey house-building projects are carried out as isolated projects, involving 15 designers, 20 subcontractors and 40 material suppliers. Relations between most of the project participants are ad-hoc. ICT-use is regulated by the architect’s CAD manual regarding layer structures, routines for information exchange during design, use of a project network, hardware, software and filing. 2 D CAD is the predominant design tool. ICT is widely used for administrative purposes, especially by the large contractors.

The CFR protocol, {{which is consistent with}} the half-duplex mode assumption, consists of two phases.

40|$|Abstract—A {{differential}} space–time {{shift keying}} (DSTSK) -aided successive-relaying-assisted multiuser decode-and-forward (DF) cooperative system is proposed. We employ low-complexity noncoherent detection, which requires channel state information (CSI) at neither the relay nodes (RNs) nor at the destination node (DN). More explicitly, the source nodes (SNs) employ differen-tially encoded phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation, whereas the RNs perform soft-input–soft-output multiple-symbol differential sphere decoding (SISO-MSDSD) -based DF relaying during the relaying phase. Similarly, DSTSK transmission is employed at the RNs, which is detected {{with the aid}} of SISO-MSDSD at the DN. More explicitly, three-stage serial-concatenated turbo encoding/decoding is employed throughout the system to enhance the attainable performance. Additionally, a maximum–minimum determinant-based configuration selection (MMBCS) algorithm is proposed to select the optimal DSTSK configuration for support-ing a specific number of users. Moreover, we adopt a successive-relaying architecture for recovering the conventional 50 % half-duplex relaying-induced throughput loss at the cost of sup-porting less users.
