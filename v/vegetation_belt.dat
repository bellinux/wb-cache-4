40|$|Mountains {{provide an}} {{opportunity}} to examine changes in biodiversity across environmental gradients and areas of transition (ecotones). Mountain ecotones separate <b>vegetation</b> <b>belts.</b> Here, we aimed to examine whether transition areas for birds and butterflies spatially correspond with ecotones between three previously described altitudinal <b>vegetation</b> <b>belts</b> on Mt. Hermon, northern Israel. These include the Mediterranean Maquis, xero-montane open forest and Tragacanthic mountain steppe <b>vegetation</b> <b>belts.</b> We sampled the abundance of bird and butterfly species in 34 sampling locations along an elevational gradient between 500 and 2200 m. We applied wombling, a boundary-detection technique, which detects rapid changes in a continuous variable, in order to locate the transition areas for bird and butterfly communities and compare the location of these areas with the location of <b>vegetation</b> <b>belts</b> as described in earlier studies of Mt. Hermon. We found some correspondence between the areas of transition of both bird and butterfly communities and the ecotones between <b>vegetation</b> <b>belts.</b> For birds and butterflies, important transitions occurred at the lower vegetation ecotone between Mediterranean maquis and the xero-montane open forest <b>vegetation</b> <b>belts,</b> and between the xero-montane open forest and the mountain steppe Tragacanthic belts. While patterns of species turnover with elevation were similar for birds and butterflies, the change in species richness and diversity with elevation differed substantially between the two taxa.

40|$|International audienceAfter {{a review}} of the first steps in marine palynology, we show that the {{understanding}} of the northwest African setting is crucial to evaluate the potential of marine palynological studies elsewhere. We studied distribution patterns of pollen grains in recent marine sediments off NW Africa and were able to clearly relate patterns to modern pollen source areas (<b>vegetation</b> <b>belts)</b> and operating transport systems (wind belts and ocean currents). In particular patterns of Quercus, Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae-Amaranthaceae, Ephedra, Gramineae, and wet forest trees are very indicative of the position of the <b>vegetation</b> <b>belts</b> on the adjacent continent. Aeolian pollen transport is carried out by the northeast trade winds and the African Easterly Jet (AEJ). In the rain forest belt transport of pollen and fern spores also occurs by rivers. A detailed comparison between recent pollen rain samples from terrestrial and marine sites between 21 and 12 °N showed that the latitudinal range of <b>vegetation</b> <b>belts</b> is clearly reflected in the pollen samples of both environments. A migration of the southern border of the Sahara is reflected by the changing ratio between Chenopodiaceae-Amaranthaceae pollen from the desert and Gramineae pollen from the savannah belt. Distribution patterns of pollen for 9000 and 18, 000 14 C yr BP (last glacial maximum) time-slices, based on pollen records from eleven marine cores between Portugal and the Gulf of Guinea show significant latitudinal migrations of <b>vegetation</b> <b>belts,</b> but a stable position of the main wind trajectories. The AEJ had a stable position around 21 °N. The belt with trade winds had a stable position from Morocco southwards. Changing vigour of the trade winds is clearly reflected by the patterns of isopollen contours and by changes in pollen influx records...|$|R

40|$|Change in {{diversity}} of fossil pollen through time {{is used as}} a surrogate for biodiversity history. However, there have been few studies to explore the sensitivity of the measured pollen diversity to vegetation changes and the relationship between pollen diversity and plant diversity. This paper presents results of a study to assess the relationship between pollen diversity and relative abundance of pollen from different altitudinal <b>vegetation</b> <b>belts</b> (subandean forest, Andean forest, subparamo and grassparamo) in three records from the tropical Andes in Colombia. The results indicated that plant diversity in the vegetation declined with altitude and pollen diversity is positively correlated to the abundance of pollen from lower altitude <b>vegetation</b> <b>belts</b> and negatively correlated to that from the grassparamo. These results, therefore, suggest that pollen diversity coarsely reflects the diversity of the surrounding vegetation. Using this interpretation, we were able to predict changes in plant diversity over the past 430   000 years in the Colombian Andes. Results indicated that under warmer climatic conditions, more species-diverse vegetation of low elevation moved upslope to contribute more pollen diversity to the study sites, and under colder conditions, species-poor grassparamo moved downslope and observed pollen diversity was lower. This study concludes that fossil pollen diversity may provide an important proxy to reconstruct the temporal changes in plant diversity...|$|R
