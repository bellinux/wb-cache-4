40|$|Cell {{segmentation}} {{and tracking}} {{allow us to}} extract a plethora of cell attributes from bacterial time-lapse cell movies, thus promoting computational modeling and simulation of biological processes down to the single-cell level. However, to analyze successfully complex cell movies, imaging multiple interacting bacterial clones as they grow and merge to generate overcrowded bacterial communities with thousands of cells {{in the field of}} view, segmentation results should be near perfect to warrant good tracking results. We introduce here a fully automated closed-loop bio-inspired computational strategy that exploits prior knowledge about the expected structure of a colony's lineage tree to locate and correct segmentation errors in analyzed movie frames. We show that this correction strategy is effective, resulting in improved cell tracking and consequently trustworthy deep colony lineage trees. Our image analysis approach has the unique capability to keep tracking cells even after clonal subpopulations merge in the movie. This enables the reconstruction of the complete Forest of Lineage Trees (FLT) representation of evolving multi-clonal bacterial communities. Moreover, the percentage of <b>valid</b> <b>cell</b> trajectories extracted from the image analysis almost doubles after segmentation correction. This plethora of trustworthy data extracted from a complex cell movie analysis enables single-cell analytics as a tool for addressing compelling questions for human health, such as understanding the role of single-cell stochasticity in antibiotics resistance without losing site of the inter-cellular interactions and microenvironment effects that may shape it...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the molecular mechanism underlying astroglial swelling, we studied primary astrocyte cultures from newborn mouse and analyzed them for expression of functional water channels. Immunocytochemical analysis of mouse brain confirms the presence of AQP 4 location in astrocytic endfeet with a polarized pattern, as found in rat. Using Southern blot PCR and Western blot analysis, we demonstrate that primary astrocyte cultures from mouse express the AQP 4 water channel at both the RNA and protein levels. Two polypeptides, of 30 kDa and 32 kDa, were identified in the astrocytes. Densitometric analysis demonstrates that the 32 -kDa form represents 25 % of the total AQP 4 protein. Moreover, immunofluorescence experiments show strong surface membrane expression of AQP 4 protein in cultured cells, even though the polarity of the expression is not maintained. Furthermore, functional studies indicate that cultured astrocytes manifest rapid and temperature-independent volume changes in response to osmotic gradients, in agreement with a channel-mediated water transport. Water movement was found to be HgCl 2 insensitive, suggesting AQP 4 and AQP 7 as putative water channels. Using Western blot and PCR experiments, we exclude the presence of AQP 7 in astrocytes, indicating that only AQP 4 is responsible for the rapid water movement. Altogether, the results indicate that primary astrocyte cultures are a <b>valid</b> <b>cell</b> model for further investigation of the molecular mechanism of water movement in the brain and its physiological regulation...|$|E

40|$|An {{effective}} method for untangling and optimization of hexahedral unstructured non-conformal meshes is presented. The method {{has been developed}} {{as a part of}} the Numeca new mesh generator (HEXPRESS TM). The untangling algorithm is based on the successive analysis and correction of concave cells, via local untangling of sets of cells referencing a mesh node. The problem of untangling a hexahedral cell can be decomposed into untangling of the tetrahedra that constitute the cell. This subdivision is not unique and must be appropriately chosen to ensure the efficiency of the algorithm. The optimization algorithm is also based on the quality analysis and optimization of the sets of cells attached to a mesh node. Successive optimization of such sets containing <b>valid</b> <b>cells</b> results in an overall mesh quality improvement. The local optimization of hexahedral cells is performed via optimizing a variational functional for the set of tetrahedra representing the cell. It is important that identical patterns for decomposition of a cell into tetrahedra are used in both untangling and optimization.

The conventional schemes maximize the alternate performance metric, e.g., sum of the virtual SINR metric, instead of sum rate metric. Moreover, the conventional schemes assume high SINR, which is not <b>valid</b> for <b>cell</b> edge regions. For these reasons, the performance gap between aiming to maximize alternate performance metric and aiming to maximize sum rate metric becomes larger in general three-sectored cellular cases.

However, it remains a challenge to efficiently induce ES cells to differentiate into neurons. Here, we show that murine ES cells can efficiently differentiate into neurons when cultured in glial cell- conditioned medium (GCM) under attaching conditions without the formation of embryoid bodies. In comparison with murine embryonic fibroblast-conditioned medium, we found that GCM has a positive effect on limiting the generation of non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes. In addition, compared with suspension conditions, attaching conditions delay the differentiation process of ES cells.

40|$|Abstract. Orientation {{adjustment}} {{is an important}} issue in the micromanipulation of cells. A non-contact method based on a swirl for cell orientation control was introduced in this paper. The swirl is produced by a pair of opposite micro-fluids squirting from two parallel tubes. Cell orientation {{adjustment is}} realized by cells rotation due to swirl viscous drag, which drives cells to desired configurations. The appropriate distances between the end face of the two tubes and the distance between the axes of them are 1 - 3 times tube diameter for the cells rotating in the swirl central zone. Especially when the distances are kept double the cell diameter, cells rotate steadily round the swirl central point. By pulsating jetting, fluctuant micro-fluid are generated which make cell rotating a certain angle. Adjusting the pulse duration, pressure and jetting velocity, the cell rotation angle can be controlled which make orientation control more precisely. The method is <b>valid</b> for <b>cells</b> of different shapes and sizes. The effectiveness of the proposed non-contact method for cell configuration control was verified by experiments...|$|R
40|$|Cell-to-cell {{adhesion}} during aggregation of Dictyostelium discoideum {{cells is}} completely blocked by univalent antibody (Fab) directed against {{two classes of}} target sites: surface structures characteristic for aggregation-competent cells (“contact sites A”) and others present also on growth-phase cells (“contact sites B”). 3 × 105 Fab molecules bound per cell are sufficient to block contact sites A completely, although the Fab fragments cover not more than 2 % of the total cell surface. Up to 8 -fold this value can be bound per cell when Fab fragments of another specificity are used, without affecting activity of contact sites A. Blockage of cell-to-cell adhesion therefore depends on the binding of Fab fragments to specific target sites, {{rather than on the}} total number of Fab molecules bound per cell. This conclusion is also <b>valid</b> for <b>cell</b> adhesion attributed to contact sites B. Contact sites therefore represent a special class of cell-surface sites which, in cell homogenates as well as in vivo, can be traced by Fab, and which are not identical with the bulk of cell-surface antigens present on aggregating cells...|$|R

When properly differentiated they acquire the so-called cobblestone phenotype; thereby mimicking an endothelium in vivo {{that can be}} used to shed light on multiple endothelial-related processes. In the present paper we report a simple, flexible, fast and reproducible method for an efficient isolation of viable HUVECs. The isolation is per-formed by sequential short trypsinization steps at room temperature. As umbilical cords are often damaged during labor, it is noteworthy that this new method can be applied even to short pieces of cord with success. In addition, we describe how to culture HUVECs as <b>valid</b> cobblestone <b>cells</b> in vitro on different types of extracellular matrix (basement membrane matrix, fibronectin and gelatin). We also show how to recognize mature cobblestone HUVECs by ordinary phase contrast microscopy. Our HUVEC model is validated as a system that retains important features inherent to the human umbilical vein endo-thelium in vivo. Phase contrast microscopy, immuno-fluorescence and electron microscopy reveal a tight cobblestone monolayer.

While the formation of the lamellipodium is increasingly well understood, organizational principles underlying the emergence of the lamellum are just beginning to be unraveled. We report here on a 1 D mathematical model which describes the reaction-diffusion processes of a polarized actin network in steady state, and reproduces essential characteristics of the lamellipodium-lamellum system. We observe a steep gradient in filament lengths at the protruding edge, a local depolymerization maximum a few microns behind the edge, as well as a differential dominance of the network destabilizer ADF/cofilin and the stabilizer tropomyosin. We identify simple and robust organizational principles giving rise to the derived network characteristics, uncoupled from the specifics of any molecular implementation, and thus plausibly <b>valid</b> across <b>cell</b> types.

The statistical structure of the discharge of simple and complex cells has been studied {{as a function of}} the various parameters of a drifting grating: spatial frequency, orientation, drifting velocity and contrast. For simple cells it has been found that the interspike interval distributions in response to drifting gratings of various spatial frequencies differ only by a time scale factor. They can be reduced to a unique distribution by a linear time transformation. Variations in the spatial frequency of the grating induce variations in the mean firing rate of the cell but leave unchanged the statistical structure of the discharge.

In this work, we investigate the equivalence between optimal solutions of periodic structures obtained from the macro scale approach on the structure level and those of material microstructures obtained from the micro scale approach using the homogenization techniques. The minimization of the mean compliance of the macrostructure with a volume constraint is taken as the optimization problem for both structural and material designs. On the macro scale, we solve the optimization problem by gradually increasing the number of unit cells until the solution converges, in terms of both the topology and the objective function. On the micro scale, the optimal microstructure of the material is obtained for the macrostructure under prescribed loading and support conditions. The microstructure of the material compares very well with the corresponding optimal topology from the periodic macrostructural design.

Recently, the only larger study comparing the value of the 2 stem cell sources in a young patient group was confined to transplantation from HLA-identical sibling donors in older children and adolescents with acute leukemia. Based on the paucity of data in pediatric HLA-matched unrelated donor transplantation, we analyzed the outcome of 23 BM and 38 PBPC transplantations performed at our center. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment were achieved significantly faster in PBPC compared to BM recipients (18 versus 22 days and 26 versus 33 days; P <. 001 and P =. 03) whereas the risk for grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) (62 % versus 55 %; P =. 53) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD 65 % versus 59 %; P =. 54) was comparable.

The study was performed on Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with both human recombinant receptors and we compared receptor occupancy and adenylate cyclase activation by VIP, Ro 25 - 1553 – a VPAC 2 selective agonist – and [K 15,R 16,L 27]VIP(1 - 7) /GRF(8 - 27) – a VPAC 1 selective agonist – on membranes prepared from each cell line and on a mixture of membranes from cells expressing each receptor individually.

Objective To investigate stability of absolute CD 4 cell count measurement of samples in BD Vacutai-ner CD 4 Stabilization Tubes {{over the course of}} 30 days. Methods This was a laboratory-based method comparison study conducted at a rural district hospital in Beitbridge, Zimbabwe. Whole peripheral blood from 88 HIV positive adults was drawn into BD Vacutainer CD 4 Stabilization Tubes and re-tested 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 30 days after collection on BD FacsCount and Partec Cyflow cytometers in parallel. Absolute CD 4 cell levels were compared to results from paired samples in EDTA tubes analysed on BD Facs-Count at the day of sample collection (references methodology). Bland-Altman analysi...|$|R
40|$|Semi-analytical {{particle}} tracking {{methods are}} broadly used in determining advective transport within groundwater flow models. The Pollock method is currently {{implemented in the}} USGS model MODPATH as a semi-analytical particle tracking algorithm for structured grids in MODFLOW. However, this method is not <b>valid</b> for grid <b>cells</b> with irregular geometry, and new methods are needed to effectively represent local flow fields within arbitrarily shaped grid cells for tracking particles. There are currently two particle tracking methods that can create pathlines in arbitrary unstructured grids: 1) the SSP&A method and the method introduced by Painter et al. (2012). The SSP&A method uses local universal kriging interpolation of a MODFLOW hydraulic head solution {{in order to determine}} the particle velocity using head changes. The method by Painter et al. uses unconstrained least squares method on interior cells and constrained least squares method on boundary cells to calculate the particle velocity. However, these methods generate local interpolation-based velocity fields that do not respect the mass balance of the cell. Here, we develop an accurate semi-analytical particle tracking method for the new MODFLOW-USG, which uses a control volume finite difference (CVFD) approach for arbitrary unstructured grids. This particle tracking method (the Waterloo method) is based on a locally analytical Taylor Series reconstruction of the local velocity, which can be used to generate pathlines of particle movement using an Euler or high-order Runge-Kutta scheme. The approach is <b>valid</b> for any <b>cell</b> geometry and may be used for both steady-state and transient simulations, while still respecting the mass balance of the cell. By following the particle path from cell to cell, this method can trace the movement of a particle through any arbitrary unstructured multidimensional flow field generated from a CVFD model. The pathlines generated by the Waterloo method in rectilinear cells are compared to the pathlines by the Pollock method. The results show less than 1 % differences in terms of the spatial and temporal distributions of the particle exit locations. The robustness of the Waterloo method is supported by its ability to handle complex flow field within a model that contains extreme heterogeneity and zero-hydraulic conductivity zones. The approach also bypasses the “weak sink” problem by explicitly representing the local flow fields near wells or controlled by distributed leakage/recharge. Furthermore, this semi-analytical method is capable of handling multiple, off-center wells located anywhere within one cell...|$|R
