40|$|The eye {{contains}} highly vascularized {{and completely}} avascular cell layers in apposition to one another. Such tissue disposition/organization involves tight coordination of vascular growth and <b>vascular</b> <b>arrest.</b> In particular, retinal vascularization, which occurs {{during the final}} embryonic stages of development in humans, emerges {{as a result of}} coordinated interactions/ cross talks among astrocytes, endothelial cells and pericytes through balanced production of guidance, chemotactic, and pro- and anti-angiogenic regulatory factors. However, the entire repertoire of the key factors involved and their precise role in the process is not fully known. During postnatal life, damage to blood vessel...|$|E
40|$|AbstractChemokines trigger rapid integrin-dependent {{lymphocyte}} arrest to vascular endothelium. We {{show that}} the chemokines SLC, ELC, and SDF- 1 α rapidly induce lateral mobility and transient increase of affinity of the β 2 integrin LFA- 1. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3 -OH kinase (PI(3) K) activity blocks mobility but not affinity changes and prevents lymphocyte adhesion to ICAM- 1 immobilized at low but not high densities, suggesting that mobility enhances the frequency of encounters between high-affinity integrin and ligand but that at higher ligand density affinity changes are sufficient for arrest. Thus, chemokines trigger, through distinct signaling pathways, both a high-affinity state and lateral mobility of LFA- 1 that can coordinately determine the <b>vascular</b> <b>arrest</b> of circulating lymphocytes under physiologic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Chicken eggs in {{the early}} phase of {{breeding}} are between in vitro and in vivo systems and provide a vascular test environment not only to study angiogenesis but also to study tumorigenesis. After the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) has developed, its blood vessel network can be easily accessed, manipulated and observed and therefore provides an optimal setting for angiogenesis assays. Since the lymphoid system is not fully developed until late stages of incubation, the chick embryo serves as a naturally immunodeficient host capable of sustaining grafted tissues and cells without species-specific restrictions. In addition to nurturing developing allo- and xenografts, the CAM blood vessel network provides a uniquely supportive environment for tumor cell intravasation, dissemination, and <b>vascular</b> <b>arrest</b> and a repository where arrested cells extravasate to form micro metastatic foci...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study characterizes defects {{associated}} with abnormal mesoderm development in mouse embryos homozygous for the induced Ednrbs- 1 Acrg allele of the piebald deletion complex. The Ednrbs- 1 Acrg deletion results in recessive embryonic lethality and mutant embryos exhibit a truncated posterior body axis. The primitive streak and node become disfigured, consistent with evidence that cell migration is impaired in newly formed mesoderm. Additional defects related to mesoderm development include notochord degeneration, somite malformations, and abnormal <b>vascular</b> development. <b>Arrested</b> heart looping morphogenesis and a randomized direction of embryonic turning indicate that left–right development is also perturbed. The expression ofnodal and leftb, Tgf-β-related genes {{involved in a}} left-determinant signaling pathway, is variably lost in the left lateral plate mesoderm. Mutational analysis has demonstrated that Fgf 8 and Brachyury (T) are required for normal mesoderm and left–right development and the asymmetric expression of nodal and leftb. Fgf 8 expression in nascent mesoderm exiting the primitive streak is dramatically reduced in mutant embryos, and diminished T expression accompanies the progressive loss of paraxial, lateral, and primitive streak mesoderm. In contrast, axial mesoderm persists and T and nodal appear to be appropriately expressed in their specific domains in the node and notochord. We propose that this mutation disrupts a morphogenetic pathway, likely involving FGF signaling, important {{for the development of}} streak-derived posterior mesoderm and lateral morphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Vascular {{cognitive}} impairment {{is a common}} yet preventable cause for dementia. It needs high degree of suspicion and appropriate designing of investigatory tools to confirm diagnosis, identify comorbidities, and ascertain the areas of impairment.

Early diagnosis using the mandatory criteria will help in early initiation of disease modifying treatment strategies which can result in partial reversal of <b>vascular</b> changes and <b>arrest</b> of progression. Patients with young onset disease might require genetic characterization for designing more aggressive treatment. Discussion and Conclusion. Dementias as such carry poor course and prognosis resulting in severe Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for patients and caregivers.

40|$|Role of {{angiotensin}} in renal vascular development. All {{components of}} the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are expressed in the developing kidney in a temporospatial pattern that suggests a role for this system in kidney morphogenesis. Pharmacological blockade of angiotensin actions in fetal and newborn animals results in striking alterations in kidney architecture, including immature glomeruli and papillae, dilated tubuli, and <b>arrested</b> <b>vascular</b> development. Inactivation of angiotensinogen or angiotensin converting enzyme genes in mice results in similar anomalies that begin as subtle alterations in early life and become more pronounced as extrauterine life progresses. However, inactivation of each angiotensin receptor subtype does not result in obvious morphological abnormalities, suggesting functional redundancy at the receptor level. Crossing of mice lacking the various receptor subtypes should be revealing. Overall, the available information suggests that the RAS {{is necessary for the}} normal morphological and functional development of the kidney and the preservation of kidney architecture in adult life...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemokine}} thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC; CCL 17) {{is displayed}} by cutaneous (but not intestinal) venules, and {{is thought to}} trigger <b>vascular</b> <b>arrest</b> of circulating skin homing memory T cells, which uniformly express the TARC receptor CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 4. Cutaneous T cell–attracting chemokine (CTACK; CCL 27), expressed by skin keratinocytes, also attracts cutaneous memory T cells, and is hypothesized to assist in lymphocyte recruitment to skin as well. Here we show that chronic cutaneous inflammation induces CD 4 T cells expressing E-selectin binding activity (a marker of skin homing memory cells) in draining lymph node, and that these E-selectin ligand � T cells migrate efficiently to TARC and to CTACK. In 24 h in vivo homing assays, stimulated lymph node T cells from wild-type mice or, surprisingly, from CCR 4 -deficient donors migrate efficiently to inflamed skin; and an inhibitory anti-CTACK antibody {{has no effect on}} wild-type lymphocyte recruitment. However, inhibition with anti-CTACK monoclonal antibody abrogates skin recruitment of CCR 4 deficient T cells. We conclude that CTACK and CCR 4 can both support homing of T cells to skin, and that either one or the other is required for lymphocyte recruitment in cutaneous delayed type hypersensitivity.

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} (T 1 D) {{is caused}} by autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing β cells in the pancreatic islets, which are essentially mini-organs embedded in exocrine tissue. CTLs are considered to have a predominant role in the autoimmune destruction underlying T 1 D. Visualization of CTL-mediated killing of β cells would provide new insight into the pathogenesis of T 1 D, but has been technically challenging to achieve. Here, we report our use of intravital 2 -photon imaging in mice to visualize the dynamic behavior of a virally expanded, diabetogenic CTL population in the pancreas at cellular resolution. Following <b>vascular</b> <b>arrest</b> and extravasation, CTLs adopted a random motility pattern throughout the compact exocrine tissue and displayed unimpeded yet nonlinear migration between anatomically nearby islets. Upon antigen encounter within islets, a confined motility pattern was acquired that allowed the CTLs to scan the target cell surface. A minority of infiltrating CTLs subsequently arrested at the β cell junction, while duration of stable CTL–target cell contact was {{on the order of}} hours. Slow-rate killing occurred in the sustained local presence of substantial numbers of effector cells. Collectively, these data portray the kinetics of CTL homing to and between antigenic target sites as a stochastic process at the sub-organ level and argue against a dominant influence of chemotactic gradients...|$|E
40|$|The {{function}} of CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP 1), a recently described transmembrane protein expressed {{on the surface}} of hematopoietic stem cells and normal and malignant cells of different tissue origin, is not well defined. The contribution of CDCP 1 to tumor metastasis was analyzed by using HeLa carcinoma cells overexpressing CDCP 1 (HeLa-CDCP 1) and a high-disseminating variant of prostate carcinoma PC- 3 naturally expressing high levels of CDCP 1 (PC 3 -hi/diss). CDCP 1 expression rendered HeLa cells more aggressive in experimental metastasis in immunodeficient mice. Metastatic colonization by HeLa-CDCP 1 was effectively inhibited with subtractive immunization-generated, CDCP 1 -specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) 41 - 2, suggesting that CDCP 1 facilitates relatively late stages of the metastatic cascade. In the chick embryo model, time- and dose-dependent inhibition of HeLa-CDCP 1 colonization by mAb 41 - 2 was analyzed quantitatively to determine when and where CDCP 1 functions during metastasis. Quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical analyses indicated that CDCP 1 facilitated tumor cell survival soon after <b>vascular</b> <b>arrest.</b> Live cell imaging showed that the function-blocking mechanism of mAb 41 - 2 involved enhancement of tumor cell apoptosis, confirmed by attenuation of mAb 41 - 2 –mediated effects with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Under proapoptotic conditions in vitro, CDCP 1 expression conferred HeLa-CDCP 1 cells with resistance to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, whereas ligation of CDCP 1 with mAb 41 - 2 caused additional enhancement of the apoptotic response. The functional role of naturally expressed CDCP 1 was shown by mAb 41 - 2 –mediated inhibition of both experimental and spontaneous metastasis of PC 3 -hi/diss. These findings confirm that CDCP 1 functions as an antiapoptotic molecule and indicate that during metastasis CDCP 1 facilitates tumor cell survival likely during or soon after extravasation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} and outcome of fetoscopic laser coagulation in pregnancies with twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence. METHODS: In a prospective multicenter study, percutaneous fetoscopic laser coagulation of placental anastomoses (n = 18) or {{the umbilical cord}} of the acardiac twin (n = 42) was performed in 60 consecutive pregnancies at a median gestational age of 18. 3 (range, 14. 3 - 24. 7) weeks under local or locoregional anesthesia. RESULTS: <b>Vascular</b> coagulation with <b>arrest</b> of blood flow was achieved in 82 % (49 / 60) of cases by laser alone and in a further 15 % (9 / 60) by laser coagulation in combination with bipolar forceps. The overall survival rate of the pump twin was 80 % (48 / 60). Median gestational age at delivery was 37. 4 (range, 23. 7 - 41. 4) weeks and the median interval between the procedure and delivery was 18. 2 (range, 1. 1 - 25. 7) weeks. Median birth weight was 2720 (range, 540 - 3840) g. Preterm premature rupture of membranes before 34 weeks' gestation occurred in 18 % (11 / 60) at a median of 62 (range, 1 - 102) days after the procedure. However, only two (3 %) women delivered within 28 days of the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Fetoscopic laser coagulation of placental vascular anastomoses or the umbilical cord of the acardiac twin is an effective treatment of TRAP sequence, with a survival rate of 80 %, and 67 % of pregnancies with surviving pump twins going beyond 36 weeks' gestation without further complications. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Inhibition of {{vascular}} endothelial {{growth factor}} A (VEGFA) signal transduction <b>arrests</b> <b>vascular</b> and follicle development. Because antiangiogenic VEGFA isoforms are proposed to block proangiogenic VEGFA isoforms from binding to their receptors, {{we hypothesized that}} proangiogenic isoforms promote and antiangiogenic isoforms inhibit these processes. The antiangiogenic isoforms Vegfa_ 165 b and Vegfa_ 189 b were amplified and sequenced from rat ovaries. The Vegfa_ 165 b sequence was 90 % homologous to human VEGFA_ 165 B. Quantitative RT-PCR determined that Vegfa_ 165 b mRNA was more abundant around Embryonic Day 18, but Vegfa_ 189 b lacked a distinct pattern of abundance. Antiangiogenic VEGFA isoforms were localized to pregranulosa and granulosa cells of all follicle stages and to theca cells of advanced-stage follicles. To {{determine the effects of}} VEGFA isoforms in developing ovaries, Postnatal Day 3 / 4 rat ovaries were cultured with VEGFA_ 164 or an antibody to antiangiogenic isoforms (anti-VEGFAxxxB). Treatment with 50 ng/ml of VEGFA_ 164 resulted in a 93 % increase in vascular density (P < 0. 01), and treated ovaries were composed of fewer primordial follicles (stage 0) and more developing follicles (stages 1 – 4) than controls (P < 0. 04). Ovaries treated with 5 ng/ml of VEGFAxxxB antibody had a 93 % increase in vascular density (P < 0. 02), with fewer primordial and early primary follicles (stage 1) and more primary, transitional, and secondary follicles (stages 2, 3, and 4, respectively) compared with controls (P < 0. 005). We conclude that neutralization of antiangiogenic VEGFA isoforms may be a more effective mechanism of enhancing vascular and follicular development in perinatal rat ovaries than treatment with the proangiogenic isoform VEGFA_ 164...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} prevalence, characteristics, risk factors, and temporal profile of concurrent ischemic lesions in patients with acute primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Methods: Patients were recruited within a prospective, longitudinal, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ‐based study of primary ICH. Clinical, demographic, and MRI data were collected on all subjects at baseline and 1 month. Results: Of the 138 patients enrolled, mean age was 59 years, 54 % were male, 73 % were black, and 84 % {{had a history of}} hypertension. At baseline, ischemic lesions on diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) were found in 35 % of patients. At 1 month, lesions were present in 27 %, and of these lesions, 83 % were new and not present at baseline. ICH volume (p = 0. 025), intraventricular hemorrhage (p = 0. 019), presence of microbleeds (p = 0. 024), and large, early reductions in mean arterial pressure (p = 0. 003) were independent predictors of baseline DWI lesions. A multivariate logistical model predicting the presence of 1 ‐month DWI lesions included history of any prior stroke (p = 0. 012), presence of 1 or more microbleeds (p = 0. 04), black race (p = 0. 641), and presence of a DWI lesion at baseline (p = 0. 007). Interpretation: This study demonstrates that >⅓ of patients with primary ICH have active cerebral ischemia at baseline remote from the index hematoma, and ¼ of patients experience ongoing, acute ischemic events at 1 month. Multivariate analyses implicate blood pressure reductions in the setting of an active vasculopathy as a potential underlying mechanism. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of these lesions on outcome and optimal management strategies to <b>arrest</b> <b>vascular</b> damage. Ann Neurol 2012; 71 : 199 – 20...|$|R
40|$|Expressing {{exogenous}} genes after naked DNA delivery into hepatocytes might achieve {{sustained and}} high expression of human proteins. Tail vein DNA injection is an efficient procedure for gene transfer in murine liver. Hydrodynamic procedures in large animals require organ targeting, and improve with liver vascular exclusion. In the present study, two closed liver hydrofection models employing the human alpha- 1 -antitrypsin (hAAT) gene are compared to reference standards {{in order to}} evaluate their potential clinical interest. A solution of naked DNA bearing the hAAT gene was retrogradely injected in 7 pig livers using two different closed perfusion procedures: an endovascular catheterization-mediated procedure (n = 3) with infrahepatic inferior vena cava and portal vein blockage; and a surgery-mediated procedure (n = 4) with completely sealed liver. Gene transfer was performed through the suprahepatic inferior cava vein in the endovascular procedure and through the infrahepatic inferior vena cava in the surgical procedure. The efficiency of the procedures was evaluated 14 days after hydrofection by quantifying the hAAT protein copies per cell in tissue and in plasma. For comparison, samples from mice (n = 7) successfully hydrofected with hAAT and healthy human liver segments (n = 4) were evaluated. Gene decoding occurs efficiently using both procedures, with liver <b>vascular</b> <b>arrest</b> improving its efficiency. The surgically closed procedure (sealed organ) reached higher tissue protein levels (4 x 10 ^ 5 - copies/cell) than the endovascular procedure, though the levels were lower than in human liver (5 x 10 ^ 6 - copies/cell) and hydrofected mouse liver (10 ^ 6 - copies/cell). However, protein levels in plasma were lower (p< 0. 001) than the reference standards in all cases. Hydrofection of hAAT DNA to "in vivo" isolated pig liver mediates highly efficient gene delivery and protein expression in tissue. Both endovascular and surgically closed models mediate high tissue protein expression. Impairment of protein secretion to plasma is observed and might be species-related. This study reinforces the potential application of closed liver hydrofection for therapeutic purposes, provided protein secretion improves...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{reactive}} oxygen species (ROS) and Phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI 3 K) in vascular differentiating of embryonic stem (ES) cells is largely unknown. Here we show that silencing PI 3 K catalytic subunit p 110 α and NOX 1 using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or inhibition of Rac 1 significantly abolished the superoxide (O 2 -) production stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in mouse ES cells and in ES cell-derived Flk- 1 + vascular progenitor cells. Moreover, silencing p 110 α or inhibition the Rac 1 <b>arrested</b> <b>vascular</b> development at initial stages of vasculogenesis in embryoid bodies even under VEGF treatment. In sorted Flk- 1 positive ES cells tube-like structure formation on matrigel and cell migration in the scratch migration assay were totally impaired in absence of p 110 α, whereas silencing NOX 1 in ES cells caused {{a significant reduction in}} the PECAM- 1 positive area, branching points, cell migration and tube length upon VEGF treatment. However, vascular differentiation markers were still produced in shRNA VEGF treated NOX 1 knock down ES cells. The efficiency of silencing the p 110 α catalytic subunit of PI 3 K and NOX 1 to inhibit angiogenesis/vasculogenesis were investigated for their capacity to inhibit tumor-induced angiogenesis in confrontation cultures consisting of embryoid bodies and multicellular DU- 145 prostate tumor spheroids. Interestingly, we found that silencing p 110 α can strongly inhibited the vascularization of multicellular tumor spheroids in confrontation cultures. These findings provide direct evidence that the activity of p 110 α in endothelial cells is essential in vasculogenesis/angiogenesis and suggest that p 110 α and their downstream signalling cascade may represent promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of numerous human diseases that involve aberrant neovascularization...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effect of initial hyperkalemic reperfusion (HKR), with and without added adenosine, on {{coronary}} flow, myocardial function, and endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent coronary <b>vascular</b> function. Cardioplegic <b>arrest</b> was induced in 40 isolated guinea pig hearts by infusing oxygenated cardioplegic (high in potassium ion) Krebs solution for 5 minutes. Hearts were then stored at room temperature for 3. 5 hours. On reperfusion, hearts were divided into four groups of 10 hearts each: control, reperfusion with regular Krebs solution (4. 6 mmol/L potassium chloride); base hyperkalemic reperfusion, initial reperfusion with 37 º C oxygenated, cardioplegic Krebs solution for 5 minutes; hyperkalemic reperfusion with addition of 1 mmol/L adenosine during HKR; and hyperkalemic reperfusion with addition of 5 mmol/L adenosine. Coronary reserve (adenosine bolus 2 mmol/L) and responses to acetylcholine (1 μmol/L) and nitroprusside (100 μmol/L) were examined before and after ischemia and reperfusion. Flow did not return to preischemic values in any group after reperfusion. Adenosine treatment during initial reperfusion increased coronary flow (percentage of baseline ± standard error of the mean) from 57 % ± 4 % in control and 45 % ± 3 % in hearts with hyperkalemic reperfusion to 79 % ± 3 % and 83 % ± 5 % in hearts with hyperkalemic reperfusion also treated with, respectively, 1 mmol/L adenosine and 5 mmol/L adenosine (p < 0. 05). At 30 and 60 minutes of reperfusion, however, flow remained elevated only in the group treated with 5 mmol/L adenosine. Coronary reserve and responses to acetylcholine and nitroprusside were equivalently depressed in all groups after reperfusion. Recovery of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function was improved in all groups after hyperkalemic reperfusion (54 % ± 4 % of preischemic value) compared with control (39 % ± 3 %), and recovery was further enhanced in the group treated with 5 mmol/L adenosine (60 % ± 4 %). In this ex vivo model, hyperkalemic reperfusion improved myocardial function after cardioplegic arrest and the addition of 5 mmol/L adenosine improved coronary flow. Adenosine may counteract the potassium chloride–induced vasoconstriction that occurs during hyperkalemic reperfusion and may thus improve coronary flow and myocardial function. Postischemic depression of endothelium-dependent or endothelium-independent vascular functions, however, was not alleviated by hyperkalemic reperfusion with or without adenosine.

Significant {{improvements in the}} treatment of OC are expected from the development of novel compounds having combined cytotoxic and antiangiogenic properties that make them effective on refractory tumors. Methods: Permeability of NOV 202 was determined with Caco- 2 monolayer assay. The compound’s pharmacokinetic profile and plasma:brain distribution were assessed in male C 57 Bl/ 6 mice. The compound’s impacts on tubulin, microtubules and cell cycle were investigated by using in vitro tubulin polymerization assay, cell-based immunofluorescence and live cell microscopy. The IC 50 concentrations of NOV 202 were assessed in a panel of eight cancer cell lines. Impact of the compound on vascular tube formation was determined using the StemKit and Chick chorioallantoic membrane assays. The in vivo efficacy of the compound was analyzed with an OC xenograft mouse model. Results: NOV 202 was found to suppress cancer cell proliferation at low nanomolar concentrations (IC 50 2. 3 – 12. 0 nM) and showed equal efficacy between OC cell line A 2780 (IC 50 2. 4  nM) and its multidrug-resistant subline A 2780 /Adr (IC 50 2. 3 nM). Mechanistically, NOV 202 targeted tubulin polymerization in vitro in a dose-dependent manner and in cells induced an M phase arrest. In vivo, NOV 202 caused a dose-dependent reduction of tumor mass in an A 2780 xenograft model, which at the highest dose (40 mg/kg) was comparable to the effect of paclitaxel (24 mg/kg). Interestingly, NOV 202 exhibited vascular disrupting properties that were similar to the effects of Combretastatin A 4. Conclusion: NOV 202 is a novel tubulin and vascular targeting agent that shows strong anticancer efficacy in cells and OC xenograft models. The finding that the compound induced significantly more cell death in Pgp/MDR 1 overexpressing OC cells compared to vincristine and paclitaxel warrants further development of the compound as a new therapy for OC patients with treatment refractory tumors and/or relapsing disease.

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{retinoblastoma}} gene product is a cell cycle control protein that when inhibited allows cell proliferation to progress by releasing E 2 F. Retinoblastoma manipulation has been attempted to prevent intimal hyperplasia (IH) in injured native vessels by <b>arresting</b> <b>vascular</b> smooth muscle cell proliferation. However, no studies {{have identified the}} role, if any, of retinoblastoma in anastomotic IH formation after prosthetic arterial grafting. The goal {{of this study was}} to describe the relation of retinoblastoma and E 2 F to anastomotic IH with analyzing retinoblastoma/E 2 F levels, retinoblastoma phosphorylation, and transcription of retinoblastoma and E 2 F in prosthetic arterial grafting. Methods: Six-mm-diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene carotid interposition grafts (n = 12) were implanted in 25 -kg mongrel dogs. The intervening arterial segments were harvested as controls. The distal anastomoses were harvested at 14 and 30 days after implantation for immunoblot, messenger RNA (mRNA), and immunohistochemistry analyses. Tissue homogenate was separated with sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed with antibody to total retinoblastoma, phosphorylated retinoblastoma at serine 795, serine 780, and serine 807 / 811, and E 2 F- 1. Bands at each time point were quantitated and compared with control artery (n = 12). Each lane was standardized with reprobing with antibody to β-tubulin. Immunohistochemistry was performed with antibody to retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma and E 2 F mRNA expression levels in anastomotic IH and control artery were analyzed with an oligonucleotide microarray. Results: Total retinoblastoma, from immunoblot analysis, was decreased at the 14 -day and 30 -day distal anastomoses by 35. 7 % and 33. 6 %, respectively, compared with control (P <. 01). Furthermore, retinoblastoma at these time points was unphosphorylated at phosphorylation sites serine 795, serine 780, and serine 807 / 811. E 2 F- 1 levels at 14 days and 30 days were unchanged compared with control. Positive staining for retinoblastoma was seen in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell from control, 14 -day, and 30 -day tissue. A qualitative decrease appeared to be seen in retinoblastoma in the neointima at 14 and 30 days compared with the native wall. No differential expression of retinoblastoma and E 2 F mRNA was seen in anastomotic IH compared with control. Conclusion: This study showed that total retinoblastoma levels are decreased and E 2 F- 1 levels remain unchanged in anastomotic IH. Attenuated retinoblastoma is a novel concept to anastomotic IH after prosthetic arterial grafting. Retinoblastoma/E 2 F imbalance may not be the result of transcriptional regulation and may increase unbound E 2 F to promote cell proliferation. Hypophosphorylation of remaining retinoblastoma may minimize uncontrolled proliferation by preventing further increases in unbound E 2 F. Therefore, retinoblastoma/E 2 F imbalance may lead to the early but limited increase in cell proliferation seen after prosthetic arterial grafting and appears to contribute to the development and progression of anastomotic IH.
