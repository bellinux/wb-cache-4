40|$|Universal {{coverage}} is a core health system goal {{which can be}} met {{through a variety of}} health financing mechanisms. The focus of this PhD is on one of these mechanisms, community-based health insurance (CBHI). CBHI aims to provide financial protection from the cost of seeking health care through <b>voluntary</b> <b>prepayment</b> by community members; typically it is not-for-profit and aims to be community owned and controlled. Despite its popularity with international policymakers and donors, CBHI has performed poorly in most low and middle income countries. The overarching objective of this PhD is therefore to understand the determinants of low enrolment and high drop-out in CBHI. The PhD builds on the existing literature, which employs mainly economic and health system frameworks, by critically applying social capital theory to the analysis of CBHI. A mixed-methods multiple case study research design is used to investigate the relationship between CBHI, bonding and bridging social capital at micro and macro levels and active community participation. The study focuses on Senegal, where CBHI is a component of national health financing policy. The results suggest that CBHI enrolment is determined by having broader social networks which provide solidarity, risk pooling, financial protection and financial credit. Active participation in CBHI may prevent drop-out and increase levels of social capital. Overall, it seems CBHI is likely to favour individuals who already possess social, economic, cultural and other forms of capital and social power. At the macro level, values (such as voluntarism, trust and solidarity) and power relations inhering in social networks of CBHI stakeholders are also found to help explain low levels of CBHI enrolment at the micro level. The results imply the need for a fundamental overhaul of the current CBHI model. It is possible that the needed reforms would require local institutions to develop new capacities and resources that are so demanding that alternative public sector policies such as national social health insurance might emerge as a preferable alternative...|$|E
40|$|The {{combined}} survival {{status of}} the insured lives is a critical problem when pricing and reserving insurance products {{with more than one}} life. Our preliminary experience examination of bivariate annuity data from a large Canadian insurance company shows that the relative risk of mortality for an individual increases after the loss of his/her spouse, and that the increase is especially dramatic shortly after bereavement. This preliminary result is supported by the empirical studies over the past 50 years, which suggest dependence between a husband and wife. The dependence between a married couple may be significant in risk management of joint-life policies. This dissertation progressively explores Markovian models in pricing and risk management of joint-life policies, illuminating their advantages in dependent modeling of joint time-until-death (or other exit time) random variables. This dissertation argues that in the dependent modeling of joint-life dependence, Markovian models are flexible, transparent, and easily extended. Multiple state models have been widely used in historic data analysis, particularly in the modeling of failures that have event-related dependence. This dissertation introduces a ¡°common shock¡± factor into a standard Markov joint-life mortality model, and then extends it to a semi-Markov model to capture the decaying effect of the "broken heart" factor. The proposed models transparently and intuitively measure the extent of three types of dependence: the instantaneous dependence, the short-term impact of bereavement, and the long-term association between lifetimes. Some copula-based dependence measures, such as upper tail dependence, can also be derived from Markovian approaches. Very often, death is not the only mode of decrement. Entry into long-term care and <b>voluntary</b> <b>prepayment,</b> for instance, can affect reverse mortgage terminations. The semi-Markov joint-life model is extended to incorporate more exit modes, to model joint-life reverse mortgage termination speed. The event-triggered dependence between a husband and wife is modeled. For example, one spouse's death increases the survivor's inclination to move close to kin. We apply the proposed model specifically to develop the valuation formulas for roll-up mortgages in the UK and Home Equity Conversion Mortgages in the US. We test the significance of each termination mode and then use the model to investigate the mortgage insurance premiums levied on Home Equity Conversion Mortgage borrowers. Finally, this thesis extends the semi-Markov joint-life mortality model to having stochastic transition intensities, for modeling joint-life longevity risk in last-survivor annuities. We propose a natural extension of Gompertz' law to have correlated stochastic dynamics for its two parameters, and incorporate it into the semi-Markov joint-life mortality model. Based on this preliminary joint-life longevity model, we examine the impact of mortality improvement on the cost of a last survivor annuity, and investigate the market prices of longevity risk in last survivor annuities using risk-neutral pricing theory...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the use of non-interest terms in bank loans is a way to {{maintain}} the borrowers 2 ̆ 7 flexibility to prepay freely. If <b>voluntary</b> <b>prepayments</b> are penalty-free, as widely observed for bank loans in practice, over time good borrowers prepay their loans while bad borrowers stay. This reclassification effect leaves the lender with bad borrowers only. Increasing the interest rate is not sufficient to compensate the lender for the prepayment risk, so the bank resorts to non-interest credit rationing. In addition to non-price instruments such as collateral, a non-linear pricing approach, in which the loan price is split into the interest and the upfront fee, can be employed. The model predicts that: higher loan prices and lower refinancing costs are associated with higher upfront fees; secured loans use higher upfront fees, but performance-sensitive loans use lower. Empirical evidence supports these predictions. Using a sample of 29, 510 term loans to U. S. firms between 1992 and 2011, we find that a 100 basis points increase in the loan spread leads to an average increase in the upfront fee by over 15 basis points. Loans with higher refinancing costs, unsecured loans and performance-sensitive loans are in general associated with lower upfront fees...|$|R
40|$|In a {{leveraged}} employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), an ESOP borrows {{funds from}} a bank or other lender. The company (sponsor) may guarantee the loan or otherwise commit, directly or indirectly, to make contributions, pay dividends, or both to the ESOP. Alternatively, the sponsor may borrow funds and then make a loan to the ESOP. Sponsor contributions and dividends are used by the ESOP to service the debt. Some leveraged ESOP borrowings require level repayment of the debt {{over a period of}} years. Alternatively, the repayment schedule for the ESOP loan may be nonlevel and may depend on the sponsor's expected cash flow or expected compensation costs. Loans may be structured to require only interest payments {{for a number of years}} or may permit negative amortization. Debt agreements also may require prepayments of debt if the sponsor's cash flow exceeds certain thresholds or may permit <b>voluntary</b> <b>prepayments</b> by the sponsor. Shares acquired by the ESOP are allocated to participants based on principal payments or principal and interest payments. SOP 76 - 3 states that the amount contributed or committed to be contributed by the sponsor to the ESOP with respect to a given year should be the measure of the amount to be charged to expense by the Copyright © 1990, Financial Accounting Standards Boar...|$|R
