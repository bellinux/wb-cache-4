50|$|Restricted {{stock is}} {{generally}} {{incorporated into the}} equity valuation of a company by counting the restricted stock awards as shares that are issued and outstanding. This approach {{does not reflect the}} fact that restricted stock has a lower value than unrestricted stock due to the <b>vesting</b> <b>conditions</b> attached to it, and therefore the market capitalization of a company with restricted stock outstanding may be overstated. However, restricted stock has less of an impact than stock options in this regard, as the number of shares awarded tends to be lower and the discount for illiquidity tends to be smaller.|$|E
40|$|Thank you for {{consulting}} Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) on {{the construction}} standards and <b>vesting</b> <b>conditions</b> for water and sewerage infrastructure, including Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS), {{to be connected to}} the public network. Our response focuses on the contribution that SUDS can make to the natural heritage. We very much welcome the adopting of SUDS by Scottish Water (SW). It is a practical means of ensuring that the SUDS infrastructure is maintained and functional and provides improved and sustainable protection for the freshwater environment. We also believe that SW, as a public body, has other obligations such as the biodiversity duty under the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 and the duty to promote sustainable flood management under the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 (WEWS) which should help to maximise the wider benefits of SUDS. These obligations are summed up in the SUDS triangle, as mentioned in the consultation: the slowing of flows (related to flooding), reduction of diffuse pollution and amenity (which may include nature conservation). We note that Sewers for Scotland 2 (SfS 2) makes no mention of SW’s biodiversity dut...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: For {{beginning}} exercisers {{or those}} with conditions that limit walking speeds, modifications to walking programs are needed to facilitate cardiorespiratory improvement. Purpose: To examine how oxygen consumption (VO 2), relative exercise intensity (percentage of age predicted heart rate maximum) (REI), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) are affected while using a weighted vest during slow inclined treadmill walking. Methods: Thirteen untrained women (37 ± 11. 2 yr, 69. 1 ± 14. 4 kg, 30. 6 ± 7. 4 % body fat) performed a standardised walking trial (4 -min stages at 0, 5, 10, and 15 % gradients) on a treadmill at a constant 1. 12 m/s under three weighted <b>vest</b> <b>conditions</b> (0, 10, and 15 % of body mass (BM)). VO 2 and heart rate were measured continuously throughout each bout. RPE was recorded {{at the end of}} each minute. Results: Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant vest versus gradient interactions for VO 2 and REI. Follow-up contrasts showed a nonlinear relationship between weighted <b>vest</b> <b>conditions</b> and gradient for VO 2 and REI. At 0 % gradient there was no significant difference in VO 2 or REI between the 0 % BM (10. 2 ± 1. 1 ml/kg/min, 54. 2 ± 4. 3 %, respectively) and the 10 % BM (10. 6 ± 1. 0 ml/kg/min, 55. 6 ± 3. 8 %, respectively) conditions. A significant difference was found in VO 2 and REI when a 15 % BM vest (11. 4 ± 1. 5 ml/kg/min, 57. 4 ± 6. 7 %, respectively) was used at 0 % gradient. At the highest gradient (15 %), there was no significant difference in VO 2 or REI between 10 % BM (25. 7 ± 1. 3 ml/kg/min, 86. 7 ± 6. 5 %, respectively) or 15 % BM (25. 9 ± 1. 5 ml/kg/min, 87. 9 ± 5. 7 %, respectively); however, both were significantly different from 0 % BM (23. 6 ± 0. 8 ml/kg/min, 82. 1 ± 6. 9 %, respectively). A significant difference was shown for VO 2 and REI for both weighted <b>vest</b> <b>conditions</b> compared to no vest at 5 % and 10 % gradients. No significant interactions were found between weighted <b>vest</b> <b>conditions</b> for RPE. Conclusion: For untrained women, using a weighted vest equivalent to 15 % BM can increase VO 2 and REI with no concomitant impact on perceived exertion during slow graded treadmill walkin...|$|R

For beginning exercisers {{or those with}} conditions that limit walking speeds, modifications to walking programs are needed to facilitate cardiorespiratory improvement. Purpose: To examine how oxygen consumption (VO 2), relative exercise intensity (%APHRM), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) are affected while using a weighted vest during slow inclined treadmill walking. Methods: Thirteen untrained women (37 ± 11. 2 yr, 69. 1 ± 14. 4 kg, 30. 6 ± 7. 4 %Body Fat) performed a standardized walking trial (4 -min stages at 0, 5, 10, and 15 % gradients) on a treadmill at a constant 1. 12 m/s under three weighted <b>vest</b> <b>conditions</b> (0, 10, and 15 % of body mass (BM)). VO 2 and heart rate were measured continuously throughout each bout. RPE was recorded {{at the end of}} each minute. Results: Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant vest versus gradient interactions for VO 2 and %APHRM. Follow-up contrasts showed a nonlinear relationship between v weighted <b>vest</b> <b>conditions</b> and gradient for VO 2 and %APHRM. At 0 % gradient there was no significant difference in VO 2 or %APHRM between 0 %BM (10. 2 ± 1. 1 ml/kg/min, 54. 2 ± 4. 3 %APHRM, respectively) and 10 %BM (10. 6 ± 1. 0 ml/kg/min, 55. 6 ± 3. 8 %APHRM, respectively) conditions. A significant difference was found in VO 2 and %APHRM when a 15 %BM (11. 4 ± 1. 5 ml/kg/min, 57. 4 ± 6. 7 %APHRM, respectively) vest was used at 0 % gradient. At the highest gradient (15 %), there was no significant difference in VO 2 or %APHRM between 10 %BM (25. 7 ± 1. 3 ml/kg/min, 86. 7 ± 6. 5 %APHRM, respectively) or 15 %BM (25. 9 ± 1. 5 ml/kg/min, 87. 9 ± 5. 7 %APHRM, respectively); however, both were significantly different from 0 %BM (23. 6 ± 0. 8 ml/kg/min, 82. 1 ± 6. 9 %APHRM, respectively). A significant difference was shown for VO 2 and %APHRM for both weighted <b>vest</b> <b>conditions</b> compared to no vest at 5 % and 10 % gradients. No significant interaction was found between weighted <b>vest</b> <b>conditions</b> for RPE. Conclusion: Using a weighted vest can increase VO 2 and %APHRM during slow graded treadmill walking, with a 5 % increase from 10 %BM to 15 %BM having no significant impact on perceived exertion.

40|$|Exercise-induced {{increase}} in core body temperature {{may lead to}} the development of hyperthermia (> 40. 0 degrees C) and/or decreased performance levels. This study examined the effects of wearing a cooling vest during a 5 -km time trial on thermoregulatory responses and performance. 10 male masters athletes (42 +/- 10 years) performed a 5 -km time trial on a motorized treadmill in a climate chamber (25 degrees C, 55 % relative humidity) with and without a cooling vest. Split times, heart rate, core-, skin- and cooling vest temperature were measured every 500 m. Subjects also rated thermal comfort and level of perceived exertion. The cooling vest significantly decreased heart rate (p< 0. 05), decreased skin temperature (p< 0. 001) and improved thermal comfort (p< 0. 005) during the time trial. Time to finish the 5 -km time trial and pacing strategy did not differ between the control (1 246 +/- 96 s) and cooling <b>vest</b> <b>condition</b> (1 254 +/- 98 s, p= 0. 85). Additionally, thermoregulatory responses, maximum core body temperature and level of perceived exertion were not different across conditions (p= 0. 85, p= 0. 49, p= 0. 11, respectively). In conclusion, we demonstrated that wearing a cooling vest during exercise improves thermal comfort but does not enhance performance or decrease core body temperature in male masters athletes under temperate ambient conditions...|$|R

Rocket Internet takes a larger equity stake in startup companies than is typical for most early stage investors. Moreover, it allocates equity to the founders rather than buying it from them.

50|$|Factor out windfalls {{unrelated}} to the managers' own efforts in calculating bonuses or granting stock options. One way is Indexing Operating Performance to exclude market and sector-wide share price movements. With stock options the exercise price would follow the index. Instead of issuing options to the executive with an exercise price equal to the current market price of (for example) $100, the options strike price would be $100 multiplied by the market index. Performance <b>conditioned</b> <b>vesting</b> would not adjust the strike price but simply not vest the options unless certain performance targets were met. The adjustments could be designed to be gentle, moderate or aggressive depending on the firm's situation. A more gentle benchmark to be exceeded for example might be the appreciation of the shares of the bottom 20 percent of firm in the company's sector. Another windfall to be adjusted for would be falling interest rates.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} vest loading on sprint {{kinetics}} and kinematics during the acceleration and maximum velocity phases of sprinting are relatively unknown. A repeated measures {{analysis of variance}} with post hoc contrasts {{was used to determine}} whether performing 6 -second maximal exertion sprints on a nonmotorized force treadmill, under 2 weighted <b>vest</b> loading <b>conditions</b> (9 and 18 kg) and an unloaded baseline condition, affected the sprint mechanics of 13 males from varying sporting backgrounds. Neither vest load promoted significant change in peak vertical ground reaction force (GRF-z) outputs compared with baseline during acceleration, and only 18 -kg loading increased GRF-z at the maximum velocity (8. 8 %; effect size [ES] = 0. 70). The mean GRF-z significantly increased with 18 -kg loading during acceleration and maximum velocity (11. 8 - 12. 4 %; ES = 1. 17 - 1. 33). Horizontal force output was unaffected, although horizontal power was decreased with the 18 -kg vest during maximum velocity (- 14. 3 %; ES = - 0. 48). Kinematic analysis revealed decreasing velocity (- 3. 6 to - 5. 6 %; ES =- 20. 38 to - 0. 61), decreasing step length (- 4. 2 %; ES = - 0. 33 to - 0. 34), increasing contact time (5. 9 - 10. 0 %; ES = 1. 01 - 1. 71), and decreasing flight time (- 17. 4 to 226. 7 %; ES = - 0. 89 to - 1. 50) with increased loading. As a vertical vector-training stimulus, it seems that vest loading decreases flight time, which in turn reduces GRF-z. Furthermore, it seems that heavier loads than that are traditionally recommended are needed to promote increases in the GRF-z output during maximum velocity sprinting. Finally, vest loading offers little as a horizontal vector-training stimulus and actually compromises horizontal power output...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} carry load is a {{requirement}} for military personnel. Lighter individuals are often disadvantaged compared to their heavier counterparts during load carriage. When exercising in hot environments individuals with a larger Body Surface Area (BSA) are more able to dissipate heat more effectively. The interaction of load carriage performance in hot and cool conditions between individuals of different body sizes has not been examined. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effect body size has on an individual’s {{ability to carry}} load in cool and hot environments. Method - Eight male (means±SD; Age 20 ± 1 Years, stature 176. 26 ± 4. 32 cm, Body mass (Bm) 71. 31 ± 10. 25 kg, BSA 1. 85 ± 0. 14 m 2) volunteered. Participants completed four separate conditions: cool Unloaded (CUn), Cool with Load Carriage (CLC), Hot Unloaded (HUn) and, lastly, Hot with Load Carriage (HLC). In the loaded conditions participants wore a 15 kg weighted <b>vest.</b> The hot <b>condition</b> was performed in 40 °C heat with a relative humidity level of 30 % and cool condition a temperature of 13 °C with a relative humidity level of 80 %. In each test condition participants walked on a treadmill at 6. 5 km·h- 1 for ten minutes, the last two minutes of which expired air was collected in a Douglas bag. After a two-minute rest, participants completed a 2. 4 km best effort run and Performance time (Pt) was recorded. Heart Rate (HR), deep body temperature (Tc), skin temperature (Tski) and speed were recorded at the start and end of both the walk and run. Data Analysis – Data analysed using a two-way-repeated-measure ANOVA with an effect size calculation, with follow up t-test. Pearsons Correlations were made to investigate BSA/Bm and Pt. Results – Significant increases in Pt were seen for both temperature (p= 0. 001) and loading (p= 0. 001) main effects.
