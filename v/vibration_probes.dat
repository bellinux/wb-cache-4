40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the comparison between}} Vibration Analysis (VA) and Acoustic Emission (AE) method to predict the defect severity in rolling element bearings {{with respect to the}} gradual increase of defect size. In bearing fault diagnosis vibration based methods are very popular, but the signals acquired by its transducers from the bearings are distorted by other faults and mechanical noise from the equipment. Vibration based methods are effective when the defect in the bearings has already become severe. AE is a non destructive testing (NDT) technique used in structural health monitoring and its application for bearing defect diagnosis is gaining momentum as an alternate diagnostic tool because of its inherent high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). A bearing test rig was designed and set up to study the various defects in rolling element bearings in real environment. In earlier cases, though the researchers studied on different types of seeded defects with random sizes, they could not ascertain the correlation between their defect sizes and the vibration amplitude. The experimental investigation reported in this paper is centered on seeded defect of same type with gradual increase of its size on outer race of radially loaded cylindrical roller bearings and running the defective bearing at different speeds and loads. Data acquired through AE & <b>vibration</b> <b>probes</b> simultaneously for better diagnosis. Comparisons between AE and VA over a range of speed and load conditions at gradual increase of defect size are presented and from them it is concluded that AE method is superior to identify the severity of defect...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} of the present industrial research on centrifugal compressors {{is the need for}} extending the left margin of the operating range of the machines. As a result, interest is being paid to accurately evaluating the amplitude of the pressure fluctuations caused by rotating stall, which usually occurs prior to surge. The related aerodynamic force acting on the rotor can produce subsynchronous vibrations, which can prevent the machine's further operation, in case their amplitude is too high. These vibrations are often contained due to the stiffness of the oil journals. Centrifugal compressor design is, however, going towards alternative journal solutions having lower stiffness levels (e. g., active magnetic bearings or squeeze film dampers), which will be more sensitive to this kind of excitation: consequently, a more accurate estimation of the expected forces in the presence of dynamic external forces such as those connected to an aerodynamically unstable condition is needed to predict the vibration level and the compressor operability in similar conditions. Within this scenario, experimental tests were carried out on industrial impellers operating at high peripheral Mach numbers. The dedicated test rig was equipped with several dynamic pressure probes that were inserted in the gas flow path; moreover, the rotor vibrations were constantly monitored with typical <b>vibration</b> <b>probes</b> located near the journal bearings. The pressure field induced by the rotating stall in the vaneless diffuser was reconstructed by means of an ensemble average approach, thus defining the amplitude and frequency of the external force acting on the impeller. The calculated force value was then included in the rotordynamic model of the test rig: the predicted vibrations on the bearings were compared with the measurements, showing satisfactory agreement. Moreover, the procedure was applied to two real multistage compressors, showing notable prediction capabilities in the description of rotating stall effects on the machine rotordynamics. Finally, the prospects of the proposed approach are discussed by investigating the response of a real machine in high-pressure functioning when different choices of journal bearings are made. © 2013 by ASME...|$|E

40|$|Wet gas {{compression}} {{technology is}} of great value to {{the oil and gas}} industry for boosting of unprocessed well stream and to reduce investment costs related to equipment and personnel. The growing interest in wet gas compression leads to a general request for accurate performance calculation procedures and proper measurement techniques for multiphase flow metering in compressors. An impeller rig for examination of single-phase and multiphase performance and aerodynamic stability is under construction at the test facility at NTNU. The construction of the compressor rig is behind time due to late deliveries of the compressor components and instrumentation. The performance calculations are therefore based upon one compressor test conducted with dry gas at part-load. The thermodynamic equation of state for ambient air is verified to be consistent with the ideal gas law in the compressor pressure and temperature range. The calculated polytropic performance is calculated with ideal gas assumptions and compared to values estimated by PRO/II. By analyzing the results the sensitivity of the calculation procedures is identified and the suitability for the ideal polytropic performance calculations is validated for the actual compressor test and operating range. A sensitivity analysis is conducted in order to determine the effect of measurement uncertainties on performance calculations. Due to the low pressures involved for the compressor test, the performance calculation procedures are highly sensitive to uncertainties in the pressure measurements. Uncertainties in the temperature measurements will only slightly influence the polytropic head, but have great influence on the polytropic efficiency. The efficiency and operating range of a compressor are constrained by aerodynamic instabilities. This thesis describes the different flow phenomena associated with compressor instability and presents recommendations for suitable instrumentation and measuring techniques. Various visualization techniques are in addition evaluated to determine the suitability for multiphase compressors. Dynamic pressure transducers installed in the inlet and discharge piping are recommended for detection of pressure pulsation throughout the compressor system. Unsteady internal pressure measurements can be obtained from circumferentially distributed pressure transducers at various locations within the compressor components. <b>Vibration</b> <b>probes</b> installed at each end of the rotor are recommended for the vibration measurements. By analyzing the frequency spectrum for the pressure fluctuation and radial vibrations one can identify the type of instability phenomenon that occur.

40|$|LecturePg. 111 - 122 Although turbocompressors {{have been}} designed, built, {{and used in}} {{increasingly}} stringent conditions for more than 80 years, the turbomachinery industry, like all comparable industries, can only design and manufacture its products {{within the realm of}} existing knowledge and foreseeable operating, engineering, and scientific parameters. As end users of turbocompressors continue to implement ever more complex and demanding assortments of processes and process variables into their operations (i. e., equipment efficiencies, higher pressures, and the like), previously unseen combinations of factors can create new and unpredictable forces and effects on equipment. These unpredictable forces may, at different times, cause destructive results in the end user's facility, such as in piping, valves, gauges, tanks, etc. It is possible for these forces, which may only exist under the unique circumstances present at the end user's site, occasionally to manifest themselves in the centrifugal compressor rotor. When this occurs, the rotors may exhibit such phenomena as rotordynamic excitation, less than anticipated aerothermal performance, or even a physical failure of a rotor or other component. When this unfortunate circumstance occurs, turbocompressor OEMs dedicated to both customer satisfaction and continued expansion of knowledge and technical responsiveness, will investigate (typically in cooperation with the end user) to determine, if possible, the full range of dynamics that may be occurring during process operation at the end user's site, so that the turbomachines can, if possible, be made to withstand the unforeseen forces. These efforts typically involve some combination of analytical studies and research testing; analytical work to provide a sound computational model, and testing to provide the data necessary to calibrate or bound the models. The test program and results described herein represent an OEMs and end user's efforts to identify the cause of repeated impeller failures in an offshore gas reinjection compressor. A machine identical to the field units was fully instrumented with aerodynamic and mechanical instrumentation (including radial and axial <b>vibration</b> <b>probes,</b> dynamic and static straingauges, dynamic pressure transducers, and other interstage pressure and temperature instrumentation). The compressor was then tested at full load and full pressure on hydrocarbon gas at the OEMs facility. Descriptions of the instrumentation and test procedure are provided.

Many times the coupling will then be removed {{and sent to the}} shop or to the manufacturer for inspection, repair, and rebalancing. In many of these cases, especially with dry couplings, however, the root cause is elsewhere [1]. The coupling vibration-and sometimes damage can be a symptom of other problems in the train. What these vibrations mean is addressed as related to the coupling and vibration signature. Is it the coupling, or is the rotor out of balance? Or, is there a problem with the fit between the two? What else could be wrong? Field cases are presented where suspected coupling problems turned out to be something entirely different. In one case, an axially vibrating coupling {{turned out to be the}} result of a resonance condition in the feedback loop in the controller of a variable frequency motor. This resonance caused a torsional vibration that showed up axially in the coupling. In another case, three different high performance disc and two different high performance gear couplings were installed before a vibration problem was traced to pipe strain induced misalignment. Other cases are presented, including some where the coupling actually was the problem. Moreover, coupling balancing is covered, especially as it relates to the overall rotor balance condition. How can you be assured that a coupling balanced at the factory will still be in balance when installed in the field? What is the importance of balancing tolerances and how significant are they when referenced to the out of balance due to fits and clearances? It is shown that the setup indication tolerances are a more significant contributor to overall coupling balance than actual balance machine unbalance tolerances. All of the cases presented involve dry couplings-ones that don't have lubricated gear teeth. On almost all new high performance turbomachinery applications, dry couplings have replaced the gear type, and one of the reasons for this is the general lack of coupling problems associated with the dry couplings (except for an occasional wind age problem). There are usually no wearing parts, and there are less clearances (like in gear tooth mesh), which can lead to significant unbalance and vibration in sensitive applications...|$|E

40|$|Noninvasive {{viscoelasticity}} imaging, or “dynamic elastography”, {{methods have}} recently been developed to objectively quantify the local viscoelastic properties of soft tissues by measuring the local propagation velocity of mechanical shear vibrations (e. g. faster velocity indicates stiffer material). But, the existing elastography technologies require a potentially uncomfortable external mechanical stimulation (e. g. <b>vibrations</b> <b>probe)</b> to induce muscle vibrations; and sophisticated and expensive imaging equipments (such as MRI and ultrafast ultrasound elastography), involving complex signal processing, to record and analyze these muscle vibrations. The work in this dissertation lays {{the foundation for the}} development of a low cost, passive, non-invasive elastography by analyzing and processing Surface Mechanomyograms (S-MMGs) measured with one dimensional accelerometers from the biceps brachii muscle. Aim 1 of this dissertation focused on the 3 -dimensional aspect of vibrations measured by accelerometers on the skin surface above the biceps brachii. While Aim 2 focused on using one-dimensional accelerometers to determine the propagation direction of the propagating S-MMG waves. Using this newly developed knowledge on S-MMG Aim 3 was accomplished, a method to analyze the propagating wave and develop a metric that can track the changes in the muscle was developed, namely, the coherence length. The coherence length was found to significantly increase with increased contraction levels for all seven of the subjects. Overall the results of this study show that the propagation features of S-MMG vibrations reflect the architecture and contraction level of the biceps brachii muscle.

40|$|LecturePg. 7 - 18 The {{importance}} of correlating rotordynamic analytical results to actual test data has become extremely important in recent years. Many user specifications require the verification of vendor generated analytical results {{in conjunction with}} shop unbalance testing. This correlation generally includes critical speed, amplification factor, and vibration magnitude. Several problems arise during shop unbalance testing. First, {{it is not always}} feasible to place an unbalance test weight in a location where it will logically excite the mode in question. This can lead to test runs where, despite a large unbalance weight, the residual unbalance is more influential than the test weight. Thus, the resulting rotor vibration is controlled by the residual unbalance and not the test unbalance. Consequently, any type of analytical correlation for this situation is extremely difficult. Another problem with test stand data is that it usually comes from four different <b>vibration</b> <b>probe</b> locations. This results in four vibration plots and, in many cases, four different critical speeds, amplification factors, and vibration magnitudes. Again, the analytical correlation for this situation is extremely difficult, since determining the actual values for these parameters is somewhat nebulous. These problems are addressed herein and a solution is offered. Several examples of analytical and test stand results are presented for steam turbines and centrifugal compressors. These examples highlight and discuss the problem areas identified. A method is presented for subtracting the vibration due to residual unbalance from that of the verification test. The resulting vibration with residual subtraction isolates the effect of the unbalance weight, and leads to improved correlation with analytical predictio...|$|R

By controlling the amplitude of AFM probe, the tip-sample interaction force can be sufficiently adjusted. Therefore, vibration-mode of AFM system can be used to manipulate nano-entities just as in using the standard contactmode manipulation strategy. Using the novel method, nanoimaging and nanomanipulation could both be performed in vibration-mode, and the damages of the sample and probe tip can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, by detecting the amplitude of OMSPV change during operation, the precise position information between the probe tip and nano-entities (e. g., CNTs) can be determined automatically as well.

As Katz (1925 / 1989) noted, people have a rich impression of the surface, not of the vibrations themselves. A theoretical account of this perceptual process must take into account three general components: (1) the physics of the probe-tip/surface interaction and the trans-mission of <b>vibrations</b> through the <b>probe</b> shaft, (2) the fil-tering imposed by the skin and the responses of the mechanoreceptors, and (3) higher order factors that might alter roughness perception, such as active versu...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{experimentally}} study {{the behavior of}} a freely rotating asymmetric probe immersed in a vibrated granular medium. For a wide variety of <b>vibration</b> conditions the <b>probe</b> exhibits a steady rotation whose direction is constant with respect to the asymmetry. By changing the vibration amplitude and by filtering the noise in different frequency bands we show that the velocity of rotation depends not only on the RMS acceleration Γ, but also on the amount of energy provided to two separate frequency bands, which are revealed to be important for the dynamics of the granular medium: The first band governs the transfer of energy from the grains to the probe, and the second affects the dynamics by altering the viscosity of the vibro-fluidized material. © 2011 American Physical Society...|$|R
40|$|In Atomic Force Microscopy the {{deflection}} and torsion of micro-fabricated elastic beams with {{a sensor}} tip {{are used to}} generate high-resolution images of sample surfaces. In dynamic modes, the cantilever is vibrated while the surface is scanned. Between the tip and the sample the force interaction occurs at least during {{a fraction of a}} vibration cycle. In Atomic Force Acoustic Microscopy flexural and torsional cantilever vibrations are excited by out-of-plane and in-plane ultrasonic sample surface vibrations, respectively. The contrast of AFAM images contains local elastic, adhesive and frictional sample properties. In the piezo-mode, an electric ac-voltage applied at the sensor tip contacting excites local surface <b>vibrations</b> and hence <b>probes</b> the local piezoelectric activity. Quantitative evaluations of AFAM images in the linear elastic interaction region yield local indention and shear moduli of sample surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Atomically thin binary {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) semiconductors exhibit diverse {{physical properties}} {{depending on their}} composition, structure, and thickness. By adding another element in these materials, which will lead to formation of ternary 2 D materials, the property and structure would greatly change and significantly expanded applications could be explored. In this work, we report structural and optical properties of atomically thin chromium thiophosphate (CrPS 4), a ternary antiferromagnetic semiconductor. Its structural details were revealed by X-ray and electron diffraction. Transmission electron microscopy showed that preferentially cleaved edges are parallel to diagonal Cr atom rows, which readily identified their crystallographic orientations. Strong in-plane optical anisotropy induced birefringence that also enabled efficient determination of crystallographic orientation using polarized microscopy. The lattice <b>vibrations</b> were <b>probed</b> by Raman spectroscopy and exhibited significant dependence on thickness of crystals exfoliated down to a single layer. Optical absorption determined by reflectance contrast was dominated by d&# 8211;d-type transitions localized at Cr 3 + ions, which was also responsible for the major photoluminescence peak at 1. 31 eV. The spectral features in the absorption and emission spectra exhibited noticeable thickness dependence and hinted at a high photochemical activity for single-layer CrPS 4. The current structural and optical investigation will provide a firm basis for future study and application {{of this kind of}} atomically thin magnetic semiconductors...|$|R
40|$|Eddy Current probes {{are used}} for the testing of steam {{generator}} tubing integrity in nuclear power plants. Their use environment is far more severe than the distribution environment, which includes truck and airplane delivery of small parcels. As each probe has soldered connections susceptible to damage this study was undertaken to investigate a possible influence of vibrations due to transport to a probe lifetime. A sweep vibration test was performed on a product with no packaging. It proved that the probe was able to vibrate in different ways unless restricted by the package. With the packaging solution defined in more detail a sample of 10 probes was exposed to random vibrations on a shaker table. Later these probes were tested for lifetime together with the sample of 10 virgin probes. Results were analyzed for statistical significance and the statistics proved the influence of <b>vibrations</b> to the <b>probe</b> lifetime. Finally, the laboratory testing results were compared with the probe lifetime data obtained during a real steam generator inspection...|$|R
40|$|From density {{functional}} calculations, we {{show that}} localized states stemming from defects or topological disorder exhibit an anomalously large electron-phonon coupling. We provide a simple analysis to explain the observation and perform a detailed study on an interesting system: amorphous silicon. We compute first principles deformation potentials (by computing the sensitivity of specific electronic eigenstates to individual classical normal modes of <b>vibration).</b> We also <b>probe</b> thermal fluctuations in electronic eigenvalues by first principles thermal simulation. We find {{a strong correlation between}} a static property of the network [localization, as gauged by inverse participation ratio (IPR) ] and a dynamical property (the amplitude of thermal fluctuations of electron energy eigenvalues) for localized electron states. In particular, both the electron-phonon coupling and the variance of energy eigenvalues are proportional to the IPR of the localized state. We compare the results for amorphous Si to photoemission experiments. While the computations are carried out for silicon, very similar effects have been seen in other systems with disorder.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new experimental rig to test journal fluid film bearings. It {{has been operating}} at the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) in Cleveland, Ohio since August 2006. The rig can apply total radial loads of up to 133, 000 N (30, 000 lbs) and can rotate the shaft to speeds up to 13, 000 RPM. The test bearing used in the initial runs has a diameter of 68 mm and a length of 38 mm. Two such bearings are used to support the total load. The shaft is also supported by two fluid film bearings. The rig is well instrumented for the measurement of oil flow, oil inlet and outlet temperatures, bearing sleeve circumferential temperatures and the oil temperatures in oil supply pockets. The shaft position is monitored by proximity <b>probes.</b> <b>Vibration</b> levels at four locations are also displayed and recorded. Preliminary tests of wave bearings running at 8, 000 RPM and loads to 20, 000 N (4, 500 lbs) show a good agreement between the test and prediction data...|$|R
