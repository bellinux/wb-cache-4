The aim of this study was to determine the cellulase activity by Bacillus sp. on lignocellulosic materials mainly on different sizes of PKC and <b>vegetable</b> <b>wastes.</b> Besides that, pH, temperature, and inocula concentrations will also being tested for the optimum reaction of Bacillus sp. on the substrates. The PKC that were used can be divided into two types which are raw PKC and defatted PKC that had undergone Soxhlet oil removal. The results shown raw PKC, defatted PKC and <b>vegetable</b> <b>wastes</b> substrates have highest cellulase activity at 2. 65 FPU/ml, 7. 73 FPU/ml and 85. 48 FPU/ml respectively. The optimum pH and incubation temperature for cellulase activity of Bacillus sp. was pH 4 and 50 °C respectively. Bacillus concentrations of 2 x 105 cells/ml and 2 x 106 cells/ml, inoculated on PKCs and <b>vegetable</b> <b>wastes</b> produced the highest bacterial cellulases respectively. PKC with the particle size of 500 µm was the most effective in producing higher cellulase activity likewise for larger particle size, of 1 mm for <b>vegetable</b> <b>wastes.</b> From this study, Bacillus sp. holds the potential of converting lignocellulosic materials into products of commercial and industrial values such as glucose and other biofuels.

The digester was operated in the ratio of 1 : 1 of substrate to inoculums at RT. The substrate concentrations are varied such as 5 %, 7 %, 10 % was used and amount of gas produced was analyzed using digital pressure gauge. The Results obtained showed that flowers had given higher yield of biogas than <b>vegetable</b> <b>wastes</b> and the digestion period was less. The average biogas production potential of withered flowers was observed as 16. 69 g/kg in 4. 5 days, where in case of <b>vegetable</b> <b>wastes</b> it was 9. 089 g/kgS in 6 days.

Various parameters like pH, temperature and incubation time were optimized. Among the various substrates examined, it was inferred that cauliflower and cabbage yielded the maximum enzyme activity 1 1 1. 082 U g of substrate and 0. 886 U g of substrate after 96 hours, respectively. The temperature optimum for the substrates were recorded at 30 °C for cauliflower and 35 °C for cabbage at an optimum of pH 6 for both the 1 substrates.
