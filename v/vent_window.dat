2500|$|At {{approximately}} 1:11–1:14p.m., Tippit {{was driving}} slowly eastward on East 10th Street — about [...] past {{the intersection of}} 10th Street and Patton Avenue — when he pulled alongside a man who resembled the police description. Oswald walked over to Tippit's car and apparently exchanged words with him through an open <b>vent</b> <b>window.</b> Tippit opened his car door and as he walked {{toward the front of}} the car, Oswald drew his handgun and fired four shots in rapid succession. One bullet hit Tippit in the chest, one in the stomach, another in his right temple (one bullet hit a button and did not penetrate his skin). Tippit's body was transported from the scene of the shooting by ambulance to Methodist Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 1:25 p.m. by Dr. Richard A. Liguori.|$|E

5000|$|... 1977: Front door <b>vent</b> <b>windows</b> removed, added rear <b>vent</b> <b>windows</b> on {{the hard}} top in the United States ...|$|R
5000|$|Many early closed cars, {{such as the}} 1940 Pontiac Torpedo had {{front and}} rear <b>vent</b> <b>windows</b> called [...] "ventiplanes". It has hinges and a latch, thus it can be opened for {{additional}} ventilation. Most vehicles since the 1960s have removed this feature for cleaner styling, known as [...] "ventless" [...] windows. Some automakers continued to offer <b>vent</b> <b>windows</b> with American Motors made optional front <b>vent</b> <b>windows</b> on the AMC Pacer for increased flow-through ventilation. Although the front <b>venting</b> <b>windows</b> [...] "provide unmatched ventilation, air turbulence and leakage outweigh the benefits". As automobile air conditioning became more popular, front <b>window</b> <b>vents</b> disappeared by the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|Electrically-operated <b>vent</b> <b>windows</b> were {{available}} {{as early as}} 1956 on the Continental Mark II. The 1960s Cadillac Fleetwood came standard with power front and rear <b>vent</b> <b>windows,</b> in addition to standard power side windows, {{for a total of}} eight power window controls on the driver's door panel.|$|R
5000|$|This window may be set on hinges and is {{then also}} known as a <b>vent</b> <b>window.</b> Most often found on older {{vehicles}} on the front door, it is a small roughly triangular glass in front of and separate from the main window that rotates inward (see top right image) for ventilation.|$|E
50|$|At {{the attic}} level, {{there is a}} small four-light {{casement}} window in the projecting bay on the north. A semicircular <b>vent</b> <b>window</b> is in the east gable. The eaves are wide and overhanging, with some exposed rafters. One gabled dormer window on each side pierces the roof; they are set with six-light casements.|$|E
5000|$|An {{additional}} 4 {{inches of}} wheelbase provided greater rear legroom, equaling {{that of the}} long wheelbase model Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud also introduced that year. [...] Removable rear quarter lights allowed an unobstructed view in and out from the front <b>vent</b> <b>window</b> on back, much valued in the model's popular role as a [...] "parade car".|$|E
5000|$|The last American {{car with}} {{functional}} <b>vent</b> <b>windows</b> (option on 1989 Ford/Mercury) ...|$|R
50|$|The Trekker was {{produced}} from early 1981 through 1983. The Trekkers were all built on Toyota short box chassis'. All of the Trekkers {{were classified as}} SR5 by both Winnebago and Toyota, regardless of the actual VIN denotation. Originally {{there were to be}} a SR5 and Deluxe version of the Trekker, one with <b>vented</b> <b>windows</b> and one without. All 1981 Trekkers had <b>vented</b> canopy <b>windows.</b> Non <b>vented</b> canopy <b>windows</b> were not installed on the Trekker until the 1982 model year. Non <b>vented</b> <b>windows</b> were installed due to the leaking issues of a forward facing vent on the 1981 Trekkers canopy windows rather than the classification of SR5 vs Deluxe.|$|R
2500|$|... "Draft-Free" [...] {{ventilation}} system, which reduced {{wind noise}} considerably by eliminating conventional front-door <b>vent</b> <b>windows</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The car's {{weight was}} lowered by {{replacing}} the power glass side windows with fixed plexiglas (with a small sliding <b>vent</b> <b>window</b> as on many race cars) and removing luxury {{features such as}} the air conditioning, stereo, and power steering. Carbon fiber seats with 4-point race harnesses and a fire suppression system added to the race nature of the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The Custom S was {{available}} in six different body designs: two-door convertible, hardtop coupe, sports coupe, a 4-door sedan, a 4-door hardtop, and a station wagon. The sports coupe can be differentiated from the hardtop {{by the presence of}} a <b>vent</b> <b>window</b> in the front door. Interior and exterior appointments fell between the Tempest and the LeMans and GTO.|$|E
50|$|Both two- and four-door {{versions}} of the XJ Cherokee were offered throughout its lifetime, each having exactly the same track and wheelbase measurements. Two-door models, however, received longer doors and front seats that could fold forward to assist in rear passenger entry and exit. This was in addition to extended-length rear windows that did not open, although an optional rear <b>vent</b> <b>window</b> was available on some models.|$|E
5000|$|The US6 {{carried the}} design of Studebaker’s {{civilian}} truck cab, although it was modified for military use. Studebaker trucks were different from other [...] 6x6 trucks built for the war effort of the USA because <b>vent</b> <b>windows</b> were included in each door. These <b>vent</b> <b>windows</b> were separate from the main window that rolled down into the door-frame and could be swung out {{to help with the}} truck cab's ventilation.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{completely}} restored to its original condition featuring oak paneling, opaque <b>vent</b> <b>windows,</b> pot bellied stove, and lavatory.|$|R
50|$|A {{modestly}} styled addition {{was added}} {{to the back of the}} building in 1954. The elaborate original windows were replaced in 1962 steel frame <b>vent</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
50|$|The largest {{change to}} {{date for the}} Beetle was in 1965: the {{majority}} of the body stampings were revised, which allowed for significantly larger windows. The windshield increased in area by 11% and was now slightly curved, rather than flat. Door windows increased accordingly by 6% (and door <b>vent</b> <b>window</b> edges were canted slightly back), rear side windows 17.5%, and the rear window 19.5%. The result was a more open, airy, modern look.|$|E
50|$|The bumpers on the 1933 Series 355C were sectioned, with plain {{ends and}} a three bar center. The grille was made V-shaped and blended into the painted (chrome optional) {{radiator}} shell. The radiator cap disappeared {{under the hood}} {{on the right side}} (same side as the oil level gauge). The fender tie bar, after a year's absence was sectioned and the center section was hidden behind the grille. Six horizontal doors replaced the vertical hood doors. Skirts were added to the front and rear fenders. The most significant change in body detail was the introduction of no-draft Individually Controlled Ventilation (ICV) or pivoting vent windows in the front doors and the rear quarter or rear door windows. In early production the front door window had to be lowered to disengage the channel at its front edge from the <b>vent</b> <b>window</b> to allow the <b>vent</b> <b>window</b> to pivot. In later production the sealing channel was attached to the door frame rather than to the window glass so that the <b>vent</b> <b>window</b> could be operated independently of the window glass. Windshield and rear quarter windows were made stationary. Absence of a windshield operating mechanism on the closed car allowed room to conceal the wiper motor behind the headboard. The cowl ventilator was baffled and drained {{in such a way as}} to be rainproof. Chassis changes were few and minor in nature. Controlled free wheeling was discontinued. Vacuum assist was added to the brake system. Changes in shock absorber valves extended the range of the ride control system. During the model year the dual point four lobe distributor was replaced by a single point eight lobe unit. A radio was optional. Model year sales were 2,100.|$|E
50|$|The Lombardi Grand Prix {{was built}} in two series: early models used the regular, metal engine cover from the Fiat 850 while the Series II has a louvred unit in black metal. The door windows are also different, being of a three-piece design (one on top, two lower pieces of which one could be slid open) while later cars have a more {{conventional}} layout with a <b>vent</b> <b>window</b> up front and a single piece which, however, could only be rolled halfway down.|$|E
50|$|The 1970 Chryslers {{received}} minor styling {{changes to}} the grille, taillamps and trim. The small <b>vent</b> <b>windows</b> on the front doors were dropped on the two-door hardtops.|$|R
50|$|Production of the {{original}} V-16 continued under various model names through 1937. The body was redesigned in 1933 as the model 452C. Innovations included Fisher no draft individually controlled ventilation (I.C.V. or <b>vent</b> <b>windows).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 300b (W186) was {{introduced}} in March 1954, adding vacuum assisted power brakes and front door <b>vent</b> <b>windows.</b> Engine power was upped to [...] via different Solex carburetors and an increased compression ratio of 7.5:1.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} safety {{improvements}} {{were made in}} order to comply with new American safety regulations: these included trigger-operated outside door handles, a secondary front hood latch, collapsing steering column, soft <b>vent</b> <b>window</b> latches, rotary glove compartment latch and instrument panel knobs labeled with pictographs. US models received a padded instrument panel that was optional in other markets. To meet North American head restraint requirements, VW developed the industry's first high-back bucket seat. The Standard model 111-112, called the 1200 [...] "A" [...] still used the 1200 engine {{but for the first}} time for Europe it came with a 12 volt system.|$|E
5000|$|More {{difficult}} to fabricate was its unusual cantilevered roof, which was secured {{to the body}} only at the rear C pillars. There were no side pillars, and at the front the roof rested only lightly on a fully frameless windshield. An advanced 12 square foot power sliding glass panel sunroof feature was {{difficult to}} integrate into a slender roof structure lacking A-pillar support at the front. The windshield and roof glass was specially made by PPG Industries to provide strength and be shatterproof. The door glass was ventless (having no small <b>vent</b> <b>window</b> at the front), a styling theme that would become popular some fifteen years later. The interior featured four bucket seats and the reel-type seatbelts were mounted {{in the door and}} fastened across the occupants to the full-length center console. Other features included concealed automatic headlights, door handles, and concealed trunk lid opening device.|$|E
5000|$|At {{approximately}} 1:11-1:14 p.m., Tippit {{was driving}} slowly eastward on East 10th Street — about 100 ft past {{the intersection of}} 10th Street and Patton Avenue — when he pulled alongside Oswald. Oswald walked over to Tippit's car and apparently exchanged words with him through an open <b>vent</b> <b>window.</b> Tippit opened his car door and as he walked {{toward the front of}} the car, Oswald drew his handgun and fired four shots in rapid succession, one bullet hitting Tippit in the chest, one in the stomach, another in his right temple (one bullet hit a button and did not penetrate his skin). Tippit's body was transported from the scene of the shooting by ambulance to Methodist Hospital where he was examined by two physicians, then pronounced dead at 1:25 pm by Dr. Richard A. Liguori. Oswald was later arrested after [...] "acting suspiciously" [...] by appearing nervous as police sirens neared him and by ducking into the Texas Theatre without buying a ticket.|$|E
5000|$|All four-door sedans for 1962 {{moved to}} the Cruiser's 113 in {{wheelbase}} body. However, the Cruiser remained the only four-door with rear-door <b>vent</b> <b>windows.</b> Two-door models gained a half-inch in wheelbase, up from 108.5" [...] to 109".|$|R
5000|$|... 1951 - Doors {{now have}} <b>vent</b> <b>windows.</b> Mid-year change from 9-board bed to 8 boards per bed. Last year for 80 MPH speedometer, chrome window handle knobs, and chrome wiper knob. New serial number codes: JP ½ ton, JR ¾ ton, & JS 1 ton.|$|R
2500|$|For {{increased}} cargo capacity, {{a station}} wagon body style was offered from 1977. The wagon version was only five inches longer (127mm) and weighed only [...] more than the coupe. It was also a less unusual-looking design with a squared-off back and straight, almost upright, rear side <b>windows.</b> Although front <b>vent</b> <b>windows</b> were optional on all Pacers, the wagon's rear side glass featured <b>vent</b> <b>windows</b> as standard. [...] The broad and rear liftgate opened to a wide, flat cargo area with [...] of space, significantly easing the task of loading cargo. The rear seat also folded flat to form {{a continuation of the}} cargo floor. Some wagon models featured simulated woodgrain trim on the lower body sides and the liftgate.|$|R
5000|$|Subsequent {{revisions}} to the MP design were soon made, resulting in the model MP3 which has the larger ZD engine of 305 cc which produced [...] In May 1960 the 200 mm longer MP4 arrived, featuring roll-up door windows. In August 1961 the doors were modified, now incorporating a triangular <b>vent</b> <b>window</b> and a chromed side strip. In September 1962 the final iteration, the MP5, arrived. It was again somewhat larger than the earlier MP4, with maximum length up to 2970 mm and cargo space increased by 100 mm, {{to a total of}} 1260 mm. As a matter of fact, nearly all body panels were altered in some way, with new marker lights installed, redesigned doors, a blunter and more rounded front, bigger vent openings in front of the doors' leading edge, and finally a solid metal roof rather than the earlier fabric-covered opening. The MP5 also gained more chrome trim, around the headlamps and elsewhere. April 1963 saw the introduction of automatic oil mixing for the two-stroke engine. In August 1969 new safety regulations required certain lighting changes, a driver's side headrest, and seatbelts. The MP5 remained in production until December 1971, and on sale into 1972.|$|E
5000|$|The Lancer {{wheelbase}} {{and body}} shell were {{identical to those}} of the Valiant, but interior and exterior trim were fancier on the Lancer. Lancers featured round taillights and a full-width grille, instead of the Valiant's cat's-eye taillights and central grille. For 1961, trim levels were the basic [...] "170" [...] and the premium [...] "770". In 1961, the two-door hardtop was marketed only as the [...] "Lancer 770 2-Door Hardtop". For 1962, the hardtop model was marketed as the [...] "GT 2-Door Hardtop" [...] and carried premium trim. Two-tone paint was available and instead of the front bench seat, there were two bucket seats. Also for the 1962 model, [...] "Lancer GT" [...] medallions were mounted on the doors' interior trim panels below the <b>vent</b> <b>window</b> and {{on the sides of the}} front fenders just aft of the headlamps. [...] "GT" [...] emblems were placed on the hood, the deck lid and on the vinyl dash pad. The headlamp bezels and the grille's horizontal slats were blacked-out. The GT also lacked certain ornamentation found on the 170s and 770s such as the [...] "Lancer" [...] door scripts, the slanted chrome hash marks on the lower quarter panel, and the hook-ended stainless steel door-to-fender spears.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced {{in early}} 1992 for the 1993 model year, Allanté was scaled {{down to just}} one model this year, the soft-top {{convertible}} priced at $59,975 (not including a mandatory $1,700 gas guzzler tax for vehicles sold in the United States). The removable 60.5 lb. aluminum hardtop was now a separate option, {{as well as the}} $495 LCD digital instrument cluster in place of the standard analog instruments. A $700 pearlcoat paint option (in Flax or Canyon Yellow, with Hawaiian Orchid added midyear) was available. Also optional were chrome squeeze-cast aluminum wheels. For its final model year, Allanté received the 4.6 L Northstar DOHC V8 engine. This engine was rated at [...] at 5600 rpm. Torque output was 290 ftlb Nm at 4400 rpm. A new unequal-length control arm rear suspension, shared with the Seville and Eldorado, was also introduced that year. Also new for the small Cadillacs was Road Sensing Suspension, an active damper management system, and revised disc brakes. The 1993 model used GM's Delco [...] "Premium Symphony Sound System". Other changes for the Allanté included a revised variable-assist power steering rack, deeper front spoiler, and single-piece side windows, which did away with the stationary forward <b>vent</b> <b>window.</b> Production for 1993 was the highest. Of the 4,670 Allantés manufactured for the 1993 model year, 115 were for export - France (1), Austria (2), Belgium (5), Germany (5), Switzerland (6), Japan (11), and Canada (85).|$|E
50|$|Alongside {{the fifth}} series coupés was a revised open car, the B24 convertible. This {{differed}} from the earlier B24 Spider, having roll-up windows, better seating position, and a windscreen with <b>vent</b> <b>windows.</b> In mechanical aspects, the B24 convertible {{was similar to the}} coupé of the same series.|$|R
5000|$|Power {{was down}} to [...] for the 1957 sixth series, with {{increased}} torque to offset the greater weight of the later car. The sixth series coupés had <b>vent</b> <b>windows,</b> and typically a chrome strip down the bonnet. They were the most touring oriented of the B20 series.|$|R
5000|$|The Touring {{has been}} the [...] "midrange" [...] Town & Country trim level since 2008. From 2008 to 2010, it added the {{following}} equipment to the base LX trim level: a 3.8L V6 engine, sixteen-inch (16") alloy wheels, an A/M-F/M stereo with CD/MP3 player and a 6-speaker sound system, a security system, second-row bucket seats, power-sliding rear doors and a power tailgate, and power second-row <b>windows</b> and third-row <b>vent</b> <b>windows.</b> Since 2011, it has included the following features (it was the [...] "base" [...] trim level from 2011 to 2014): a 3.6L [...] "Pentastar" [...] VVT V6 engine, a 6-speed automatic transmission, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, a touch-screen sound system, power-sliding rear doors and a power tailgate, power second-row <b>windows</b> and third-row <b>vent</b> <b>windows,</b> and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system.|$|R
