5000|$|For low boiling azeotropes, the {{volatile}} component cannot be fully purified by distillation. To obtain the pure material one must [...] "break the azeotrope", which involves a separation method {{that does not}} rely on distillation.

50|$|Control of {{the wetting}} contact angle {{can often be}} {{achieved}} through the deposition or incorporation of various organic and inorganic molecules onto the surface.

The deposition of these specialty silanes can be achieved in the gas phase {{through the use of a}} specialized <b>vacuum</b> <b>ovens</b> or liquid-phase process.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} drying methods (freeze drying, <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> drying, and shade drying) on the phytochemical constituents {{associated with the}} antioxidant activities of Z. officinale var. rubrum Theilade were evaluated to determine the optimal drying process for these rhizomes. Total flavonoid content (TFC), total phenolic content (TPC), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity were measured using the spectrophotometric method. Individual phenolic acids and flavonoids, 6 - and 8 -gingerol and shogaol were identified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography method. Ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) and 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays {{were used for the}} evaluation of antioxidant activities. The highest reduction in moisture content was observed after freeze drying (82. 97 %), followed by <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> drying (80. 43 %) and shade drying (72. 65 %). The highest TPC, TFC, and 6 - and 8 -shogaol contents were observed in samples dried by the <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> drying method compared to other drying methods. The highest content of 6 - and 8 -gingerol was observed after freeze drying, followed by <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> drying and shade drying methods. Fresh samples had the highest PPO activity and lowest content of flavonoid and phenolic acid compounds compared to dried samples. Rhizomes dried by the <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> drying method represent the highest DPPH (52. 9 %) and FRAP activities (566. 5 μM of Fe (II) /g DM), followed by freeze drying (48. 3 % and 527. 1 μM of Fe (II) /g DM, respectively) and shade drying methods (37. 64 % and 471. 8 μM of Fe (II) /g DM, respectively) with IC 50 values of 27. 2, 29. 1, and 34. 8 μg/mL, respectively.

After that, the material was centrifuged and washed by deionized water three times and heated in <b>vacuum</b> drying <b>oven</b> overnight. Then, the composite particles, super P, graphite, VGCF and polyacrylic acid were mixed for 6 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 and stirred for 6  h to be evenly mixed.

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of the use of}} waxes in the wood industry has been increasing, par-ticularly in Europe, since consumers, due to their increased environmental aware-ness, avoid using biocidally treated wood and wood from tropical forests. In this research two water-repellent emulsions in various concentrations were used: poly-ethylene and oxidised polyethylene wax emulsion. The performance of wax treated Norway spruce (Picea abies) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) wood was tested in two sorption experiments: conditioning in high relative air humidity (vapour diffusion) and non-continuous dipping (liquid flow). The sorption properties of oven and va-cuum dried impregnated specimens were determined. During conditioning, wax treated Norway spruce specimens, <b>vacuum</b> and <b>oven</b> dried, had the same moisture content as control specimens; while treated vacuum dried beech had up to 25 % lo-wer moisture content than the parallel control specimens.

40|$|This report {{includes}} major {{findings and}} outlook from the transformational electrode drying project performance period from January 6, 2012 to August 1, 2012. Electrode drying before cell assembly is an operational bottleneck in battery manufacturing due to long drying times and batch processing. Water taken up during shipment and other manufacturing steps {{needs to be}} removed before final battery assembly. Conventional <b>vacuum</b> <b>ovens</b> are limited in drying speed due to a temperature threshold needed to avoid damaging polymer components in the composite electrode. Roll to roll operation and alternative treatments can increase the water desorption and removal rate without overheating and damaging other components in the composite electrode, thus considerably reducing drying time and energy use. The objective of this project was {{the development of an}} electrode drying procedure, and the demonstration of processes with no decrease in battery performance. The benchmark for all drying data was an 80 °C vacuum furnace treatment with a residence time of 18 – 22 hours. This report demonstrates an alternative roll to roll drying process with a 500 -fold improvement in drying time down to 2 minutes and consumption of only 30 % of the energy compared to vacuum furnace treatment...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{has found that}} dried potato samples yielded {{significantly}} higher levels of steroidal alkaloids such as α-solanine and α-chaconine than the corresponding fresh samples, as determined by the UPLC-MS/MS technique. Among the drying techniques used, air drying had the highest effect on steroidal alkaloid contents, followed by freeze drying and <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> drying. There {{was no significant difference between}} the freeze dried and <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> dried samples in their α-chaconine contents. However, freeze dried potato shoots and berries had significantly higher α-solanine contents (825 µg/g dry weight (DW) in shoots and 2453 µg/g DW in berries) than the <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> dried ones (325 µg/g dry weight (DW) in shoots and 2080 µg/g DW in berries). The kinetics of steroidal alkaloid contents of potato shoots during air drying were monitored over a period of 21 days. Both α-solanine and α-chaconine content increased to their maximum values, 875 µg/g DW and 3385 µg/g DW, respectively, after 7 days of drying. The steroidal alkaloid contents of the shoots decreased significantly at day 9, and then remained unchanged until day 21. In line with the potato shoots, air dried potato tuber peels also had higher steroidal alkaloid content than the freeze dried and <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> dried samples. However, a significant decrease of steroidal alkaloid content was observed in air dried potato berries, possibly due to degradation during slicing of the whole berries prior to air drying.
