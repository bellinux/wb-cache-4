It generalizes the techniques developed by Carr and Chou (1997), Carr and Madan (1998), and Takahashi and Yamazaki (2009 a) to credit-equity models. Our scheme provides a hedging strategy across credit and equity markets, where suitable defaultable contingent claims are accurately replicated by a feasible number of plain <b>vanilla</b> <b>equity</b> options. Another {{point is that}} shorter maturity options are available to hedge longer maturity defaultable contingent claims. Through numerical examples, it is shown that the scheme is applicable to both structural and intensity-based models.

40|$|In {{the course}} of the {{following}} lectures, we will investigate why equity options are priced as they are. In so doing, we will apply many of the techniques students will have learned in previous semesters and develop some intuition for the pricing of both <b>vanilla</b> and exotic <b>equity</b> options. By considering specific examples, we will see that in pricing options, it is often as important {{to take into account the}} dynamics of underlying variables as it is to match known market prices of other claims. My hope is that these lectures will prove particularly useful to those who end up specializing in the structuring, pricing, trading and risk management of equity derivatives. I am indebted to Peter Friz, our former Teaching Assistant, for carefully reading these lecture notes, providing corrections and suggesting useful improvements. 1 Stochastic Volatility 1. ...|$|R
40|$|Faculty of Science; School of Computational and Applied Maths; MSC ThesisThe {{assumption}} of constant volatility as an input parameter into the Black-Scholes option pricing formula is deemed primitive and highly erroneous {{when one considers}} the terminal distribution of the log-returns of the underlying process. To account for the `fat tails' of the distribution, we consider both local and stochastic volatility option pricing models. Each class of models, the former being a special case of the latter, {{gives rise to a}} parametrization of the skew, {{which may or may not}} reÂ°ect the correct dynamics of the skew. We investigate a select few from each class and derive the results presented in the corresponding papers. We select one from each class, namely the implied trinomial tree (Derman, Kani & Chriss 1996) and the SABR model (Hagan, Kumar, Lesniewski & Woodward 2002), and calibrate to the implied skew for SAFEX futures. We also obtain prices for both <b>vanilla</b> and exotic <b>equity</b> index options and compare the two approaches...|$|R

More precisely, we study the continuous arithmetic average of the process over time, plain or sometimes multiplied by a knock-out indicator. We start by describing its mathematical properties and provide new distributional results (moments, densities, moment generating function among others). Some of these results also pertain to the joint distribution of the integral and the process itself. The versatility of the process enables us to consider diverse financial applications: fixed and floating strike Asian options on <b>equities,</b> European <b>vanilla</b> options on <b>equity</b> {{in the presence of}} stochastic volatility as well as zero-coupon bonds, guaranteed endowment options and average-rate claims under stochastic interest rates. We devote a great part of the present work to the square-root process and the geometric Brownian motion, two important subcases of the CEV process. For both these nested diffusions, a number of mathematical and financial quantities have been solved for in the literature in closed-form, in terms of Laplace transforms. In this thesis, we derive these quantities in a fully explicit form, which is advantageous both from a theoretical point of view, to gain insight in their mathematical structure and from a practical stand, as the numerical evaluation of our formulae appear more robust and efficient than other numerical methods for some ranges of parameters. In the general CEV case, for which the integrated process has scarcely been considered in the literature, we derive semi-closed form expressions...|$|R
