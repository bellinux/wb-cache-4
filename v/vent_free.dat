40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of the Vented Tank Resupply Experiment (VTRE) which was flown as a payload on STS 77.

5000|$|They {{started by}} {{carefully}} placing {{all of the}} pots to be fired in a fire pit, and then covered them carefully with broken pieces of pottery and aluminum sheets or any metal scraps they could find. In order to allow ventilation to keep the fire burning, they left small spaces uncovered, after which they meticulously surrounded the homemade kiln with cow chips - very dry cow dung - used to fuel the fire, careful to leave the <b>vents</b> <b>free.</b> The goal was to prevent any flame from actually touching the pots, hence the protective metal sheets. After covering the kiln with the cow chips, they lit the kindling on all sides to ensure an even distribution of heat. They continued to feed the fire with dry cedar until the fire reached the desired temperature of around 12 to 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on what look they were attempting. If the fire continued to burn, the pottery would achieve a red-brown color. But {{in order to make}} the black pottery that Maria was famous for, the fire was smothered with dry powered horse dung. By doing this, the amount of oxygen within the kiln was greatly reduced, therefore creating a reduction atmosphere which caused the color of the pots to turn black. After several hours, they shifted the horse dung around to kill the fire and bury the pots so they could cool slowly. After the kiln had cooled enough, they carefully pulled the pots out using either a stick if the pots were still hot, or waiting until they were cool enough to touch.|$|R

40|$|It {{is normal}} {{practice}} to use centrally positioned vents or single vents in most experimental {{work and in}} the application of explosion venting in industry. This work seeks to investigate the influence of non-central and multiple distributed vents on the explosion overpressure. A 10 L cylindrical vessel of 460 mm length and 162 mm diameter (L/D= 2. 8) was used for <b>vented</b> explosion with <b>free</b> <b>venting</b> (without a vent cover). Three different vent coefficient (Kv) were investigated, Kv, 3. 6, 5. 4 and 10. 9 for both non-central and 4 hole vents. 10 % methane-air and 7. 5 % ethylene-air mixtures were investigated to determine the influence of the mixture reactivity. The position of the spark ignition was in the centre of the end flange opposite the vent. It was shown for the non-central vent that the flame speed upstream of the vent was lower than for a central vent and this reduced the mass flow through the vent, which reduced the overpressure and reducing the external explosion due to the lower exit velocity of the unburnt gas and hence lower external turbulence. The external flame jets downstream of the vent was influenced by the increase in characteristic length scale of the vent, which was changed by increasing the number of vents...|$|R

These design concepts are discussed. A design employing a support structure/access arm attached to the fixed service structure was finally selected. The various design problems resolved included vent arm disconnect/drop interference, minimizing refurbishment due to launch damage, disconnect reliability, vehicle movement tracking, minimizing vent line pressure drop, and the presence of other vehicle services at the same centralized supply area.

The objective of this work was to compare central and end ignition of vented explosions in a 10 L and a 200 L cylindrical vessels of L/D of 2. 8 and 2 respectively, with vent area coefficients of 10. 9, 5. 4 and 3. 1 for <b>free</b> <b>venting.</b> Methane-air (10 % v/v) and ethylene-air (7. 5 %) explosion tests were carried out using a 16 J spark ignition {{at the far end}} wall opposite the vent and half way {{along the length of the}} vessel. The results showed that for both vessels and for both gas/air mixtures end ignition produced the highest overpressures. This was attributed to the higher axial flame speed towards the vent with far end ignition, inducing higher vent mass flows and higher external flame speeds and associated overpressures.

40|$|A Venting Gas Trap (VGT) was designed, built, {{and tested}} at NASA Johnson Space Center to {{eliminate}} dissolved and free {{gas from the}} circulating coolant loop of the Orion Environmental Control Life Support System. The VGT was downselected from two different designs. The VGT has robust operation, and easily met all the Orion requirements, especially size and weight. The VGT has a novel design with the gas trap made of a five-layer spiral wrap of porous hydrophobic hollow fibers that form a cylindrically shaped curtain terminated by a dome-shaped distal plug. Circulating coolant flows {{into the center of}} the cylindrical curtain and flows between the hollow fibers, around the distal plug, and exits the VGT outlet.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{potential}} of carbon capture and sequestration technologies to make {{a significant contribution to}} national and global efforts to control carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. We examine the performance of these technologies under two alternative future energy-policy scenarios. We conclude that carbon capture and sequestration technologies could indeed {{play a significant role in}} reducing atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 and could reduce the costs associated with stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 by 35 % or more. KEY WORDS: Carbon capture and sequestration, atmospheric stabilization, economic modeling. The scientific literature shows that the stabilization of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations requires that in the long-term, regardless of the concentration at which stabilization is to be affected, the <b>free</b> <b>venting</b> of carbon must be globally and systematically reduced (IPCC, 1996 a). This result is usually taken to mean that fossil fuel use must be globally, systematically reduced. That conclusion is erroneous. Control over CO 2 emissions can not only be achieved by curtailing the use of fossil fuels, but also by applying technologies which capture and sequester (or recycle) carbon. While there is an abundant literature on the issue of atmospheric stabilization (IPCC, 1996 b), this literature is deficient in that it has largely ignored the availability of technologies, which could capture and sequester carbon. 1 MODELING FUTURE CARBON EMISSION...|$|R

This work was carried out on the commonly used circular and square vent shapes for the same geometrical area, in order to investigate whether vent shape was a significant parameter in vent design. The work was carried out in a 0. 01 m 3 cylindrical explosion vessel with an L/D of 2. 8 with end wall ignition opposite the vent, which is close to the limit of applicability of US and European vent design guides for compact vessels. The vents were located on the centreline of the vessel and were compared under <b>free</b> <b>venting</b> conditions. The work was carried out for the most reactive gas mixtures of methane/air and ethylene/air. The impact of the vent shape was mainly on the external explosion and was significant at low Kv =V 2 / 3 /Av, with a reduced overpressure for square vents of about 30 %. The effect of the vent shape was greater for ethylene/air and occurred at all Kv tested from 3. 6 to 10. 9. There were two contributory factors to the effect, the change in the discharge coefficient of the vent with vent shape and the greater entrainment of external air into square jets, which caused the jet to spread faster and have lower flame speeds and lower external overpressures...|$|R

40|$|Authigenic {{carbonate}} rock (ACR) {{is derived}} from microbial oxidation of methane, biodegradation of crude oil, and oxidation of sedimentary organic matter. The precipitation of ACR was characterized petrographically, mineralogically, and geochemically. ACR collected from the seafloor in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and ACR recovered from drilled cores in the Krishna-Godawari (KG) basin offshore India were used. All study sites are associated with hydrocarbon gas <b>venting,</b> seepage, <b>free</b> gas, or gas hydrate. ACR from the GOM is densely cemented and extremely irregular in shape, whereas ACR from offshore India is generally an oval-shaped smooth nodule and also densely cemented. The dominant mineral in ACR is authigenic calcite. ACR contains carbon derived from sedimentary organic carbon oxidation that geologically sequesters much fossil carbon. Bulk carbon and oxygen isotopes of ACR were measured. ACR from the GOM is strongly depleted in 13 C with ? 13 C of ? 42. 5 ? and enriched in 18 O with ? 18 O of 4. 67 ?. The ? 13 C of hydrocarbon is typically more depleted in 13 C than in the associated ACR. The reason is that authigenic carbonate cements from hydrocarbon oxidation generally enclose skeletal material characterized by normal marine carbonate. Three groups that represent different hydrocarbon sources to ACR were classified in this study: primary carbon sources to ACR from (1) methane plus biodegraded oil, (2) methane, or (3) biodegraded oil. Wide ranges in ? 13 C (? 49. 12 to 14. 06 ?) and ? 18 O (1. 27 to 14. 06 ?) were observed in ACR from offshore India. In sediments, the ? 13 C may be affected by differences {{in the rate of}} organic carbon oxidation, which generate varying ? 13 C with depth during methanogenesis. Based on the wide range in ? 13 C, ACR from offshore India was classified: (1) ? 13 C may reflect high rates of organic carbon oxidation, (2) ACR may be derived primarily from methane oxidation, and (3) ? 13 C may reflect low rates of organic carbon oxidation. ? 18 O values are heavier than those of normal marine carbonates. The ? 18 O may be caused by reaction with deep-sourced water that was isotopically heavier than ambient seawater. Some samples may reflect heavy ? 18 O from gas hydrate decomposition, but it would not cause significant heavy oxygen isotopes...|$|R

The boundary layer NOx data provide top-down verification of a 50 % decrease in power plant and industry NOx emissions over the eastern United States between 1999 and 2004. Observed NOx concentrations at 8 – 12 km altitude were 0. 55 ± 0. 36 ppbv, much larger than in previous U. S. aircraft campaigns (ELCHEM, SUCCESS, SONEX) though consistent with data from the NOXAR program aboard commercial aircraft. We show that regional lightning is the dominant source of this upper tropospheric NOx and increases upper tropospheric ozone by 10 ppbv. Simulating ICARTT upper tropospheric NOx observations with GEOS-Chem requires a factor of 4 increase in modeled NOx yield per flash (to 500 mol/ flash).
