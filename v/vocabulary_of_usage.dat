40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the subject <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> in English didactics. The main aim is to study the English <b>vocabulary</b> <b>usage</b> <b>of</b> upper {{secondary}} pupils in Norway. An analysis and comparison is made of Norwegian learners’ English to native speakers’ English. The material used for the analysis is a corpus of 50 written essays, 25 written by Norwegian upper secondary pupils and 25 written by American upper secondary pupils. Vocabulary analysis factors are used to help compare the texts produced by Norwegians learners of English and native English speakers. The comparison and analysis reveals some differences and similarities between these two groups. In addition, the study looks into how individual, frequent, varied, mature, and correct the English vocabulary that Norwegian language learners use in their free writing and how well prepared they are for further academic studies in English...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{although}} the New Culture Movement took a critical {{view of the}} Confucian classics, the scholar Hu Shih used the tools of textual criticism to put the novel {{in an entirely different}} light, as a foundation for national culture. Hu and his students, Gu Jiegang and Yu Pingbo, first established that Cao Xueqin was the works author. Taking the question of authorship seriously reflected a new respect for fiction, since the lesser forms of literature had not been traditionally ascribed to particular individuals. [...] Hu next built on Cai Yuanpeis investigations of the printing history of the early editions to prepare reliable reading texts. The final, and in some respects most important task, was to study the <b>vocabulary</b> and <b>usage</b> <b>of</b> Caos Beijing dialect as a basis for Modern Mandarin.|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} a simple study of the {{creative}} aspect of language, aptly described as 'the infinite use of finite means' by Wilhelm von Humboldt (Brown 1967 : 82). More specifically it aims {{to demonstrate that the}} lexicon of the English Language (like any other language, for that matter) is self-generative. This is done by examining the formal and semantic relations between some samples of Engineering jargon, on the one hand, and the <b>vocabulary</b> <b>of</b> common ordinary <b>usage</b> including word formative lexical elements in the language, on the other, in order to show that the former is created from the latter ('more or less strained or extended use of old linguistic material' - (Sapir 1921 : 17). The introduction explains the focus of the study in greater detail and also introduces certain notions and concepts used in the analyses that follow in the two major sections of the article. Section 1 examines the nature of the formal relations between the jargon and the lexical material from which it is created. Section 2 goes a step further to analyze the nature of the semantic relations underlying the formal relations described in Section 1. It is hoped that the analyses undertaken in both these sections will successfully show that the Engineering jargon is truly the result of the creative process operating within the lexicon of the language...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Twitter, {{currently}} {{the most popular}} microblogging tool available, is used to publish more than 140, 000, 000 messages a day. Many users use hashtags to categorize their tweets. However, hashtags are not restricted in any way in terms <b>of</b> <b>usage</b> or syntax {{which leads to a}} very heterogeneous set of hashtags occurring in the Twitter universe and therefore, decreases the search capabilities. In this paper, we present an approach for the recommendation of highly appropriate hashtags to the user during the creation process. The recommendations aim at encouraging the user to (i) use hastags at all, (ii) use more appropriate hashtags and (iii) avoid the <b>usage</b> <b>of</b> synonymous hashtags. Therefore the <b>vocabulary</b> <b>of</b> hashtags becomes more homogenous regarding both syntax and semantics. ...|$|R

40|$|From {{observer}} records, a {{count was}} made for each child, {{in a group of}} disadvantaged children in an experimental preschool, <b>of</b> <b>usage</b> and acquisition <b>of</b> descriptive adjectives, with and without noun referents.

Time in school, intermittent teacher praise, and social and intellectual stimulation were not effective in changing the low rates of using adjectives of size and shape. Group teaching effectively increased rates of using color- and number-noun combinations in the group-teaching situation, but was ineffective in changing rates <b>of</b> <b>usage</b> in the children's “spontaneous” vocabularies. By operating directly on the children's language in the free-play situation, making access to preschool materials contingent upon use of a color-noun combination, significant increases in such usage were effected in the spontaneous <b>vocabularies</b> <b>of</b> all the children. Preschool materials apparently functioned as powerful reinforcers. Though traditional teaching procedures were effective in generating adjective-noun combinations in that restricted situation, it was only through application of environmental contingencies that color names as descriptive adjectives were effectively and durably established in all the children's spontaneous vocabularies...|$|R
