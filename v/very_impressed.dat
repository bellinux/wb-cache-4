5|$|Reed was <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> {{with this}} information, and {{advocated}} for the Hastings Cutoff. None {{of the party}} received Bryant's letters warning them to avoid Hastings' route at all costs; in his diary account, Bryant states his conviction that Bridger deliberately concealed the letters, a view shared by Reed in his later testimony.|$|E
5|$|Hogg {{published}} Shelley at Oxford, {{an account}} of his memories of Shelley in The New Monthly Magazine in 1833. The article was heavily edited after its submission, which irritated him greatly. The editing was effective however, and many reviewers were <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> by the finished product. He also contributed articles to the Edinburgh Review. One notable article was {{a review of the}} first volume of Barthold Georg Niebuhr's Römische Geschichte. The editor of the Edinburgh Review, Macvey Napier, chose another writer to review the second volume, which infuriated Hogg.|$|E
5|$|In 1341, King Edward III visited Norwich for a jousting tournament, {{coinciding with}} the {{completion}} of the city's defensive walls. Edward and his mother, Isabella of France, were <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> by the city and, as a token of appreciation for bearing the costs of the defensive fortifications, Edward granted the franchise of the market to the city in perpetuity. The control by the King's Clerk over trade at the market was ended and tolls and rents from the market from then on went directly to the city's bailiffs (the rulers of the city).|$|E
60|$|Frascatti {{listened intently}} to their story. He was <b>very</b> evidently <b>impressed.</b>|$|R
60|$|They {{unfolded}} {{his arms}} and hands as they lay clasped upon the table, and on lifting his head found his features to bear the <b>very</b> <b>impress</b> of death itself. Bartholomew Miller, who had now come in, assisted Mr. Paddock to make a comfortable couch in the window-seat, where they stretched out Clark upon his back.|$|R
60|$|There was a swift {{discussion}} of technicalities. Gudrun was <b>very</b> much <b>impressed.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{theme music}} was {{composed}} by Peter Davis (who {{after the second}} series composed {{the rest of the}} series alone as principal composer), John Mealing and John G. Perry. The opening titles show the main characters striking a pose, with the name of the respective actor in a typewriter style typeface. Steven Moffat and Julia Sawalha were not <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> with the opening titles when discussing them for a DVD commentary in 2004. They were re-recorded for series three, in the same style, to address the actors' ages and alterations to the set.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Balabushka met Penndel, Pennsylvania native Gus Szamboti at a tournament. Szamboti {{had been}} working for RCA as a {{draftsman}} and designer, but RCA layoffs were common at the time, and he had started designing and selling pool cues as a more stable job path. Though he too started production with Titlist blanks as well as blanks manufactured by WICO of Chicago, Szamboti later began making his own. Balabushka was <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> with Szamboti's blanks and, in addition to the two men becoming fast friends, he became Szamboti's first customer, buying blanks from him for $18 apiece.|$|E
5|$|Dan and Gretta {{meet with}} Saul, Dan's {{business}} partner {{and co-founder of}} their record label, {{but he does not}} see the same potential in Gretta and turns her away. Undeterred, Dan proposes that he and Gretta produce their own album together, to be recorded live during the summer at various public locations around New York City. Recruiting a team of talented musicians, including Gretta's best friend Steve, Dan sets out to make an album worthy of being published by his label. During this time, Dan and Gretta bond both personally and professionally, and Gretta takes Dan's teenage daughter Violet, a fledgling guitarist, under her wing and encourages her to play on the album. When the album is finished, Dan and Gretta meet again with Saul, who is <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> with their collaboration. Gretta demands that Saul give Dan his job back and give her a bigger share in the deal. They leave without reaching an agreement, but Dan feels confident that Saul will eventually sign Gretta to the label.|$|E
60|$|Aynesworth nodded {{a little}} curtly. He was not <b>very</b> favorably <b>impressed</b> with his visitor.|$|R
60|$|He bowed. He was <b>very</b> much <b>impressed</b> and he {{endeavored}} {{to assume a}} manner.|$|R
50|$|The {{far-reaching}} {{reconstruction of}} the Old Town Hall {{at the turn of}} the 15th and 16th century included the erection of the east wing adjoining to the north wall of the tower. A monumental building was constructed during the Late Gothic period. There was a council chamber with a magnificent net vault that gave the room a <b>very</b> <b>impressing</b> atmosphere of spaciousness.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{his public}} nonchalance, Seward was devastated by his {{convention}} loss, as were {{many of his}} supporters. The New Yorker was the best-known and most popular Republican, and his defeat shocked many in the North, who felt that Lincoln had been nominated through chicanery. Although Seward sent a letter stating Weed was not to blame, Seward's political manager took the defeat hard. Seward was initially inclined to retire from public life, but received many letters from supporters: distrustful of Lincoln, they urged Seward to remain involved in politics. On his way to Washington to return to Senate duties, he stopped in Albany to confer with Weed, {{who had gone to}} Lincoln's home in Springfield, Illinois to meet with the candidate, and had been <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> at Lincoln's political understanding. At the Capitol, Seward received sympathy even from sectional foes such as Jefferson Davis.|$|E
5|$|Etty did not base The Combat on {{any single}} {{incident}} from history or literature, or on any existing artwork, {{but on his}} own imagination; this was a highly unusual step to take regarding history paintings, which generally depicted themes from literature or religion. He had been considering the topic as early as 1821, and his plans took shape following his visit to Italy. During this visit Etty had met Antonio Canova and been <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> by him; The Combat is clearly influenced by his work. As well as drawing inspiration from classical sculpture, he was also strongly influenced by the composition of Old Master works he had seen while in Italy. As with many of Etty's works, the models posed for him separately in his studio, {{rather than as a}} group.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{inherits}} {{some old}} possessions {{of his grandfather}} Irving. Among them is a statue that looks just like one George's family had, until George broke it. Jerry promises that George can have it, but leaves it in his apartment for a few days. Kramer takes a few of Irving's old clothes, including a hat which he believes makes him look like Joe Friday of Dragnet. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> {{by the quality of}} the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer to check his apartment, and when Kramer cannot find the statue there, Jerry’s suspicion is confirmed.|$|E
6000|$|... “Do I {{bear the}} marks of my lineage so <b>very</b> plainly <b>impressed</b> on my appearance? I am dark, but not very red—not more so than common?” ...|$|R
60|$|The hunter's {{orders were}} <b>very</b> {{strongly}} <b>impressed</b> upon {{the women and}} children, and even the latter were made to feel thoroughly the importance of silence {{in case of an}} attack.|$|R
60|$|The Warden {{was evidently}} <b>very</b> favorably <b>impressed</b> with his Transatlantic guest, {{and he seemed}} to be in a {{constant}} state of surprise to find an American so agreeable a kind of person.|$|R
5|$|Stanton wanted EVE {{to be at}} {{the higher}} end of technology, and asked iPod {{designer}} Jonathan Ive to inspect her design. He was <b>very</b> <b>impressed.</b> Her eyes are modelled on Lite-Brite toys, but Pixar chose not to make them overly expressive as it would be too easy to have her eyes turn into hearts to express love or something similar. Her limited design meant the animators had to treat her like a drawing, relying on posing her body to express emotion. They also found her similar to a manatee or a narwhal because her floating body resembled an underwater creature. Auto was a conscious homage to HAL 9000 from , and the usage of Also sprach Zarathustra for the showdown between the captain and Auto furthers that. The manner in which he hangs from a wall gives him a threatening feel, like a spider. Originally, Auto was designed entirely differently, resembling EVE, but masculine and authoritative; the Steward robots were also more aggressive Patrol-bots. The majority of the robot cast were formed with the Build-a-bot program, where different heads, arms and treads were combined together in over a hundred variations. The humans were modelled on sea lions due to their blubbery bodies, as well as babies. The filmmakers noticed baby fat is a lot tighter than adult fat and copied that texture for the film's humans.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the last}} {{large-scale}} airborne assault by Hitler and the Germans. The German paratroopers had such a high casualty rate that Hitler forbade any further large-scale airborne attacks. The Allies, on the other hand, were <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> by the potential of paratroopers, and started {{to build their own}} airborne divisions.|$|E
25|$|Gullit {{was briefly}} re-signed by a <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> Milan in 1994, but quickly {{returned}} to Sampdoria before {{the culmination of}} the 1994–95 season. During his time, he served under manager Sven-Göran Eriksson and the two had a strong understanding and mutual respect. In his brief time at Sampdoria, he scored 15 goals.|$|E
50|$|During his {{football}} career, Granville Liggins {{played for the}} Calgary Stampeders (1968-1972) and the Toronto Argonauts (1973-1978) in the Canadian Football League. In Calgary, from 1969 to 1972, Liggins played right defensive tackle alongside left tackle John Helton, with Wayne Harris at middle linebacker, forming a <b>very</b> <b>impressing</b> middle part of a defense. He {{was a member of}} a Stampeder team that was best in the CFL in points allowed and beat the Toronto Argonauts to win the 59th Grey Cup game of 1971. Liggins made the CFL's All-Canadian Team in 1971 and 1976 and received All-Western Football Conference Honours in 1972.|$|R
60|$|I was <b>very</b> much <b>impressed,</b> {{and not for}} {{the first}} time, by my {{guardian}}'s subtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, {{and not for the}} first time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities.|$|R
60|$|The {{door opened}} again while I was still {{studying}} the two brothers, without, I honestly confess, being <b>very</b> favorably <b>impressed</b> by either of them. A new {{member of the}} family circle, who instantly attracted my attention, entered the room.|$|R
25|$|In a trial {{three years}} later, Harry Orchard would confess to having {{served as a}} paid {{informant}} for the Mine Owners Association.p.119 He reportedly told a companion, G.L. Brokaw, {{that he had been}} a Pinkerton employee for some time.p.228 Newspaper reporters were <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> with his calm demeanor on the witness stand,p.116 even under cross-examination. But historians still disagree about Harry Orchard's bloody legacy.|$|E
25|$|Sun Quan {{was unable}} to conquer Hefei after several days so he withdrew his forces. While Sun Quan was retreating, Zhang Liao {{suddenly}} launched a surprise attack and inflicted a crushing defeat on the enemy at Xiaoyao Ford (逍遙津). He was close to capturing Sun Quan a few times during the battle. Cao Cao was <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> with Zhang Liao and promoted him to General Who Attacks the East (征東將軍).|$|E
25|$|Heifetz visited much of Europe {{while still}} in his teens. In April 1911, Heifetz {{performed}} in an outdoor concert in St. Petersburg before 25,000 spectators; {{there was such a}} sensational reaction that police officers needed to protect the young violinist after the concert. In 1914, he performed with the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Arthur Nikisch. The conductor was <b>very</b> <b>impressed,</b> saying he had never heard such an excellent violinist.|$|E
50|$|When in {{his early}} 20s, Chhaju Ram met Arya Samajist {{engineer}} Raisaheb Shivnath Rai, who was <b>very</b> much <b>impressed</b> him. Rai took Ram to Kolkata and for some time Ram coached Rai’s children and also those of a businessman from Rajgarh.|$|R
6000|$|... "How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let's {{do as they}} do. I'll {{help you}} with the hard words, and they'll explain things if we don't understand," [...] whispered Beth, <b>very</b> much <b>impressed</b> by the pretty books and her sisters' example.|$|R
50|$|Xipheroceras, {{named by}} Buckman, 1911, has an evolute shell, all whorls clearly exposed, only <b>very</b> {{slightly}} <b>impressed</b> dorsally (on the inside curvature). Inner and middle whorls have strong ribs with large spines at the outer ends. Outer whorls have closer simpler ribs.|$|R
25|$|Vainio {{succeeded in}} his {{preparation}} for his home championships excellently. The 10,000 metres final {{was held on}} the third day of the Championships. Despite the slow race which culminated in the last lap, Vainio finished fourth with the time 28:01.37, missing the gold medal by only 0.33 seconds and bronze by 0.11 seconds. The home audience was <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> with his achievement, since they knew very well that he was not at his best in the slow races. The gold medal was won again by Alberto Cova.|$|E
25|$|Clark {{had been}} <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> with Gerhard Bersu's {{excavation}} of the Iron Age settlement of Little Woodbury in Wiltshire in 1938 and 1939. After the war, {{he decided to}} excavate an Iron Age settlement nearer to Cambridge using the same techniques as Bersu had used. An amateur archaeologist had found early Iron Age pottery on Micklemoor Hill near West Harling in Norfolk, and Clark began an excavation of the site in 1948. However, before Clark could finish the excavation, he was distracted by a new project.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{auditioned for}} George Cukor's stock theater company in Rochester, New York; {{although}} he was not <b>very</b> <b>impressed,</b> he gave Davis her first paid acting assignment anyway—a one-week stint playing {{the part of a}} chorus girl in the play Broadway. In 1929, Davis was chosen by Blanche Yurka to play Hedwig, the character she had seen Entwistle play in The Wild Duck. After performing in Philadelphia, Washington, and Boston, she made her Broadway debut in 1929 in Broken Dishes, and followed it with Solid South.|$|E
50|$|Visitors {{from all}} over the country left the {{province}} <b>very</b> much <b>impressed</b> after having seen the events as well as the impressive venue. After the Carnival, a Rizal Memorial Forum was erected at the site of the provincial fair, at a cost of Php 18,000.|$|R
5000|$|Camino Palmero {{garnered}} mostly negative {{reviews from}} music critics. Johan Wippsson of Melodic saw {{potential in the}} band based on [...] "Wherever You Will Go" [...] and an amount of constant energy throughout the album despite generic lyrics about relationships, concluding with, [...] "Except for {{that this is a}} <b>very</b> <b>impressing</b> debut from a group that have all the chances to be the next Lifehouse." [...] Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In commended the album for delivering positive messages of forgiveness and self-realization but found it a little indulgent in its unsavoury delights, concluding that [...] "Camino Palmero acknowledges God, celebrates lifelong love and speaks up for the destitute. But several cuts show bad form in their approach to women by modeling lust, bitterness and sexual immorality." ...|$|R
50|$|Balaji, a {{good friend}} of Nagesh and V.S.Raghavan’s {{relative}} enters now. He is foreign returned and has his own flourishing business. He meets V.S.Raghavan and Devika. Raghavan is <b>very</b> much <b>impressed</b> by Balaji and even proposes Devika to him. Balaji is extremely happy with this and accepts.|$|R
