2500|$|On 11 October, {{after an}} {{extraordinary}} cabinet meeting intended {{to address the}} events on the previous day, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced he was formally requiring the Catalan government to confirm whether it had declared independence before 16 October at 10am, with a further 3-day deadline until 19 October to revoke all deemed illegal acts if an affirmative answer—or no answer at all—was obtained. This requirement was a formal requisite needed to trigger article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, a so-called [...] "nuclear option" [...] {{that would allow the}} Spanish government to suspend Catalonia's political autonomy and impose direct rule from Madrid. Pressure mounted within the pro-independence coalition as the CUP demanded an unambiguous affirmation of Catalan independence, threatening to withdraw its parliamentary support from Puigdemont's government if he rescinded his independence claim. In his formal response to Rajoy's requirement hurrying the initial five-day deadline, Puigdemont failed to clarify whether independence had been declared and instead called for negotiations over the following two months. The Spanish government replied {{that this was not a}} <b>valid</b> <b>response</b> to its requirement and doubted that Puigdemont's offer for dialogue was sincere due to his lack of [...] "clarity". The refusal from the Catalan government to either confirm or deny independence triggered a second deadline for them to backtrack before direct rule was imposed. The Spanish government subsequently offered to abort the incoming move to suspend self-rule if the Catalan government called for a regional election, but this was ruled out by the latter.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{ambiguous}} speech during a parliamentary {{session in the}} Parliament of Catalonia on 10 October, Puigdemont declared that [...] "Catalonia had {{earned the right to}} be an independent state" [...] and that he defended [...] "the mandate of the people of Catalonia to become an independent republic". However, he immediately announced that parliament should suspend a formal declaration of independence in order to pursue dialogue with the Spanish government. Puigdemont and other pro-independence deputies then signed a symbolic declaration of independence with no legal effect.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patient {{reported}} {{outcome measures}} (PROMs) {{are used to}} evaluate lifestyle interventions but {{little is known about}} differences between patients returning <b>valid</b> and invalid <b>responses,</b> or of potential for bias in evaluations. We aimed to examine the characteristics of patients who returned <b>valid</b> <b>responses</b> to lifestyle questionnaires compared to those whose responses were invalid for evaluating lifestyle change. METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis from the SPHERE Study, a trial of an intervention to improve outcomes for patients with coronary heart disease in primary care. Postal questionnaires were used to assess physical activity (Godin) and diet (DINE) among study participants at baseline and 18 month follow-up. Three binary response variables were generated for analysis: (1) valid Godin score; (2) valid DINE Fibre score; and (3) valid DINE Total Fat score. Multivariate analysis comprised generalised estimating equation regression to examine the association of patients 2 ̆ 7 characteristics with their return of <b>valid</b> <b>responses</b> at both timepoints.

Similarly, a function that normally returns a string might sometimes return the empty string as a <b>valid</b> <b>response,</b> but return false on failure.

5000|$|A {{directed}} dialogue prompt communicates {{a set of}} <b>valid</b> <b>responses</b> to {{the user}} (e.g. [...] "How can I help you? ... Say something like, account balance, order status, or more options"). An open-ended prompt does not communicate a set of <b>valid</b> <b>responses</b> (e.g. [...] "How can I help you?"). In both cases, {{the goal is to}} glean a <b>valid</b> spoken <b>response</b> from the user. The key difference is that with directed dialogue, the user is more likely to speak an option exactly as was communicated by the prompt (e.g. [...] "account balance"). With an open-ended prompt however, the user is likely to include extraneous words or phrases (e.g. [...] "I was just looking at my bill and saw that my balance was wrong."). The open-ended prompt requires a greater degree of natural language processing to extract the relevant information from the phrase (i.e. [...] "balance"). Open-ended recognition also requires a larger grammar set, which accounts for a wider array of permutations of a given response (e.g. [...] "balance was wrong", [...] "wrong balance", [...] "balance is high", [...] "high balance"). Despite the greater amount of data and processing required for open-ended prompts, they are more interactively efficient, as the prompts themselves are typically much shorter.|$|R
