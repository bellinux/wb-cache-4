5|$|The raw wound {{fabric of}} silk or cotton was fed from large rollers into Myers' <b>varnishing</b> machine for processing. The {{processed}} wet fabric, soaked with varnish, was rubbed and pressed so the varnish {{would go into}} all the pores. The excess varnish was then removed and the wet fabric cloth hung outdoors in bright sunshine for 6 to 12 hours like laundry. The processed fabric had the elastic properties of rubber. This patented varnish that Myers invented was able to seal the balloon material to hold the hydrogen gas, that otherwise would penetrate even glass and metal. The silk or cloth fabric used required eight to ten applications of the varnish to seal properly to be thoroughly impervious to hydrogen gas.|$|E

Myers' patented varnish formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen. The varnish used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house. This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It also provided a fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose handy for putting out a fire.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the ability of calcium phosphate and fluoride containing <b>varnishes</b> to inhibit enamel demineralization. METHODS: Six <b>varnishes</b> were selected for analysis: (1) Enamel Pro containing amorphous calcium phosphate; (2) Clinpro White containing functionalized tricalcium phosphate (fTCP); (3) MI <b>Varnish</b> containing casein phosphopeptide-stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP); (4) Duraphat (first no added calcium control); (5) Profluorid (second no added calcium control); and (6) placebo (no added calcium or fluoride control). Human enamel slabs (36) were each cut into half-slabs and covered with one of the six dental <b>varnishes</b> to create a window. The half-slabs were then individually immersed in a polyacrylate demineralization buffer pH 4. 8 for four days at 37  °C with a change of solution each day.

RESULTS: All fluoride-containing <b>varnishes</b> significantly inhibited enamel demineralization when compared with the placebo <b>varnish.</b> However, out of the calcium phosphate and fluoride containing <b>varnishes</b> only MI <b>Varnish,</b> containing fluoride and CPP-ACP was superior to the fluoride-alone <b>varnishes.</b> MI <b>Varnish</b> also released the highest levels of calcium, phosphate and fluoride ions.

2500|$|Just {{as there}} is white {{patterning}} specifically associated with the leopard complex, there {{is a type of}} progressive roaning that is unrelated to graying out or true roan.

40|$|Using natural {{products}} {{can be a}} cost-effective approach for caries prevention especially in low income countries where dental caries is highly prevalent and the resources are limited. Specially prepared dental <b>varnishes</b> containing propolis, miswak, and chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NPs) with or without sodium fluoride (NaF) were assessed for antibacterial effect against Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) using disk diffusion test. In addition, the protective effect of a single pretreatment of primary teeth enamel specimens against in vitro bacterial induced enamel demineralization was assessed for 3  days. All {{natural products}} containing <b>varnishes</b> inhibited bacterial growth significantly better than 5 % NaF <b>varnish,</b> with NaF loaded CS-NPs (CSF-NPs) showing the highest antibacterial effect, though it didn’t significantly differ than those of other <b>varnishes</b> except miswak ethanolic extract (M) <b>varnish.</b> Greater inhibitory effect was noted with <b>varnish</b> containing freeze dried aqueous miswak extract compared to that containing ethanolic miswak extract, possibly due to concentration of antimicrobial substances by freeze drying.

Fluoride containing miswak <b>varnish</b> (MF) and CSF-NPs <b>varnish</b> inhibited demineralization significantly better than all experimental <b>varnishes,</b> especially during the first 2  days, though CSF-NPs <b>varnish</b> had a low fluoride concentration, probably due to better availability of fluoride ions and the smaller size of nanoparticles.

40|$|<b>Varnish</b> {{and its use}} {{has been}} known since ancient times. Altho the {{knowledge}} of <b>varnish</b> {{has been attributed to}} the Japanese as early as 500 - 600 B. C., Tschirsch and A. D. Stevens say that the Japs did not possess this art originally, but that they probably acquired it from the continent during the third century. Nevertheless, <b>varnish</b> did not come into general use until the middle ages. In the 12 th century, a monk by the name of Theophilus published the first directions for making an oil <b>varnish,</b> {{but it was not until}} 1790 in England, and between 1820 and 1830 in France and Germany, that a factory was established for the commercial production of <b>varnish.</b> In general, a <b>varnish</b> may be defied as a homogeneous, sticky, viscous solution of resins, of a colloidal nature, which when applied to a surface in a thin coat, dries to a hard, smooth, glossy surface. The color of <b>varnish</b> varies considerably, depending on the grade and on its use. Pale <b>varnishes</b> are generally sought, yet there are many dark <b>varnishes</b> of excellent quality. The following scale gives an idea of the degree of color of <b>varnish.</b> A solution of 0. 25 g K 2 Cr 2 O 7 in 100 g pure concentrated H 2 SO 4 is equivalent to a very light <b>varnish.</b> A solution of 2. 00 g K 2 Cr 2 O 7 in 100 g pure concentrated H 2 SO 4 is equivalent to a medium <b>varnish.</b> A solution of 4. 00 g K 2 Cr 2 O 7 in 100 g pure concentrated H 2 SO 4 is equivalent to a dark <b>varnish.</b> <b>Varnishes</b> may be divided into two main classes, according to the manner in which the film dries. The <b>varnishes</b> of the first class, which is the largest and most important, are known as oil <b>varnishes.</b> These <b>varnishes</b> dry mainly by the oxidation of the oil, which forms a tough, elastic film. The secondary drying in these oil <b>varnishes</b> is caused by the evaporation of the volatile vehicle, and by the polymerization of the constituents. On the whole, the drying of an oil <b>varnish</b> is of a chemical nature. The <b>varnishes</b> of the second class are called spirit <b>varnishes.</b> These dry merely by the evaporation of the solvent, and there is practically no chemical action. The gum is transferred from a lump form into a thin sheet by means of the solvent. The most important example of this class is shellac, which is the hardened secretion of the lac insect, dissolved in alcohol...|$|R

Since natural <b>varnishes</b> tend to darken or discolor over time, attention from a paintings conservator is often necessary to remove, replace, or restore it. It is again important to remember the artist's original intent when choosing a new <b>varnish.</b> <b>Varnishes</b> often offer a desired effect, and a synthetic variety may not offer what an originally natural resin provided.|$|R

Objective: This study aimed to analyze the amount of fluoride released into water and artificial saliva from experimental TiF 4 and NaF <b>varnishes,</b> with different concentrations, for 12 h. Material and Methods: Fluoride <b>varnishes</b> were applied on acrylic blocks and then immersed in 10 ml of deionized water and artificial saliva in polystyrene bottles. The acrylic blocks were divided in seven groups (n= 10) : 1. 55 % TiF 4 <b>varnish</b> (0. 95 % F, pH 1. 0); 3. 10 % TiF 4 <b>varnish</b> (1. 90 % F, pH 1. 0); 3. 10 % and 4 % TiF 4 <b>varnish</b> (2. 45 % F, pH 1. 0); 2. 10 % NaF <b>varnish</b> (0. 95 % F, pH 5. 0); 4. 20 % NaF <b>varnish</b> (1. 90 % F, pH 5. 0); 5. 42 % NaF <b>varnish</b> (2. 45 % F, pH 5. 0) and control (no treatment, n= 5). The fluoride release was analyzed after 1 / 2, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 h of exposure. The analysis was performed using an ion-specific electrode coupled to a potentiometer. Two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni's test were applied for the statistical analysis (p< 0. 05). Results: TiF 4 <b>varnishes</b> released larger amounts of fluoride than NaF <b>varnishes</b> during the first 1 / 2 h, regardless of their concentration; 4 % TiF 4 <b>varnish</b> released more fluoride than NaF <b>varnishes</b> for the first 6 h.

Conclusions: The 3. 10 % and 4 % TiF 4 -based <b>varnishes</b> have greater ability to release fluoride into water and artificial saliva compared to NaF varnish; however, more studies must be conducted to elucidate the mechanism of action of TiF 4 <b>varnish</b> on tooth surface...|$|R
