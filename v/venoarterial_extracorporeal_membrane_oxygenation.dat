40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> on left {{ventricular}} performance {{have not been}} studied in detail. Coronary arterial flow obtained by direct measurement with an electromagnetic flowmeter and blood gas analysis from the aortic root were tabulated during <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> in 14 puppies, and these parameters were evaluated with respect {{to changes in the}} <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> flow. Unique automatic blood pumps generating pulsatile flow were used for the <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> bypass. Coronary arterial flow decreased as the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation flow increased (106 ± 26 ml/min per 100 gm of left ventricle at 20 ml · min- 1 · kg bypass flow to 71 ± 17 ml/min per 100 gm of left ventricle at 100 ml · min- 1 · kg bypass flow, p < 0. 01). There were no significant changes in the mean or diastolic pressures in the ascending aorta despite changes in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation flow. Arterial oxygen tension in the ascending aorta was not increased even under high-flow <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation.</b> This result indicates that oxygenated blood from the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit does not pass in a retrograde fashion into the aortic root and thus does not perfuse the coronary arteries. The diastolic aortic pressure did not correlate with the changes in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation flow. The decrease in coronary arterial flow is therefore predominantly caused by increased coronary arterial resistance. Tension-time index, an indicator of myocardial oxygen consumption, did not decrease with <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation.</b> In conclusion, high-flow <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> causes undesirable hemodynamic effects on the left ventricle.

40|$|Background. Lung {{transplant}} (LTx) waitlists {{continue to}} grow internationally. Consequently, more patients are progressing to require mechanical circulatory support (MCS) as a bridge to transplantation (BTT). MCS strategies include interventional lung assist (iLA) and venovenous (VV) and <b>venoarterial</b> (VA) <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> (ECMO). We review our series of patients bridged with MCS while listed for LTx. Methods. All consecutive patients, listed for LTx requiring MCS as a BTT at the University of Alberta from 2004 to 2015, were included. Patient demographics and outcomes were compared for the 3 groups (iLA, VV-ECMO, and VA-ECMO). Results. Of the 24 patients supported with MCS devices, 17 were successfully transplanted and 7 died waiting. In total, 25 % (n= 6) were bridged with VA-ECMO, 54 % (n= 13) with VV-ECMO, and 21 % (n= 5) with iLA. Overall, 71 % of patients were bridged successfully to LTx. The 1 -year survival posttransplantation was 88 %. Conclusion. We have demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing the MCS modalities of VA-ECMO, VV-ECMO, and most recently iLA, as a BTT. MCS is a viable strategy for BTT, offering improved survival outcomes for decompensating adult patients awaiting LTx, resulting in excellent survival posttransplantation...|$|R

Adult and pediatric patients with witnessed in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and good quality CPR, failure of at least 15 min of conventional resuscitation, and a potentially reversible cause for arrest are candidates. Percutaneous cannulation where feasible is rapid and can be performed by nonsurgeons (emergency physicians, intensivists, cardiologists, and interventional radiologists). Modern extracorporeal systems are easy to prime and manage and are technically easy to manage with proper training and experience. ECPR can be deployed in the emergency department for out-of-hospital arrest or in various inpatient units for in-hospital arrest.

Animals were observed for 6 hours after weaning from the <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation.</b> At the sixth hour after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, arterial oxygen tension, venous oxygen tension, lung compliance, and cardiac output had decreased significantly. Pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary clearance of technetium 99 m-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid increased significantly also. The systemic arterial and venous carbon dioxide tensions, pH, and the base excess remained unchanged, as did the blood pressure and the systemic vascular resistance. Histopathology of the lung specimens revealed focal alveolar wall thickening and alveolar capillary congestion. The major portion of the pulmonary parenchyma looked normal. Alterations in pulmonary parameters cited were, to a major extent, explained on the basis of the experimental protocol followed and were believed to be reversible.

While VA ECMO supports the heart as well as the lungs, it has the disadvantage of requiring carotid artery ligation and the possibility of perfusing air bubbles or particles into the arterial tree. We have treated 11 newborns with respiratory failure with venovenous (VV) ECMO returning the oxygenated blood to a cannula in the distal iliac vein. We compared these patients with 16 patients treated during the same period of time with VA ECMO. Three of the 11 VV patients required conversion to VA ECMO because of inadequate oxygenation and unstable hemodynamic situations. Ten of the 11 VV patients survived. Eleven of the 16 VA patients survived. The better survival in these patients treated with VV ECMO is attributed to their more favorable initial condition compared to patients treated with VA ECMO. The disadvantages of VV ECMO include a longer operative time to place the cannulas, groin wound problems, and persistent leg swelling along with the necessity to convert some patients to VA ECMO. Although this experience demonstrates that newborns with severe respiratory failure can be supported with VV ECMO, the complications and lack of practical advantages over VA lead us to recommend VA ECMO for routine clinical use at present...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} examine the {{relationship}} between <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> center case volume and survival in pediatric patients requiring <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> support. MethodsPediatric patients (≤ 20 years) undergoing <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> cannulation were identified using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids’ Inpatient Database for 2000 to 2009. Annual hospital <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> volume tertiles were 30 patients/year (high volume). Cases of <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> were segregated by indication into cardiac and noncardiac groups. Cases of cardiac <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> were mapped to Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery categories to adjust for case complexity. Weighted multivariable logistic and linear regression models identified determinants of in-hospital mortality. ResultsOverall, 3867 cases of <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> were identified, yielding a national estimate of 6333  ±  495 cases. <b>Extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> was used with nearly equivalent prevalence across volume tertiles for all Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery categories, suggesting that patient selection for <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> was fairly uniform. A higher annual <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> volume tertile was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality (P = . 01) within nearly all Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery categories. After adjustment for Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery category and other patient variables, lower <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> volume remained an important determinant of in-hospital death (odds ratio, 1. 75; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 03 - 2. 94; P = . 03).

40|$|AbstractObjectives: Early {{allograft}} dysfunction after lung transplantation {{ranges from}} subclinical x-ray abnormalities to pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and pulmonary hypertension. Management may include extracorporeal circulation to allow {{recovery of the}} acute lung injury. We reviewed our experience with <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> after lung transplantation to assess the utility of this therapy. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed. Single or bilateral lung transplantation was performed in 444 adults from July 1988 to July 1998. Twelve (2. 7 %) patients experienced allograft dysfunction severe enough to require <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> after failure of conventional therapy, including sedation, paralysis, and inhaled nitric oxide. Results: Seven of 12 patients requiring <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> were discharged from the hospital. Mean and median times to <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> support were 1. 2 days and 0 days, respectively. Mean length of support was 4. 2 days. Four patients died while receiving <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> support. One patient was weaned from <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> but died during the hospitalization. Two patients required acute retransplantation while receiving <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation,</b> and one survived to discharge. Three patients continued to receive <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> support for more than 4 days, and all 3 died. All survivors had begun receiving <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> support by post-transplantation day 1.

DESIGN: Prospective intervention study in animals. SETTING: Animal research laboratory of a university medical center. SUBJECTS: Six anesthetized newborn lambs with patent ductus arteriosus and left-to-right shunt, installed on <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation.</b> INTERVENTIONS: Six lambs of 140 days gestational age were prepared to keep the ductus arteriosus open by infiltration of the vessel wall with formaline 10 %. The animals were installed on standard <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation.</b> With a mechanical occluder, the ductus was closed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Changes of mean arterial blood pressure and carotid artery blood flow were measured simultaneously. Using near infrared spectrophotometry, we calculated changes in cerebral concentration of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin (reflecting changes in cerebral oxygen supply) and total hemoglobin (reflecting changes in cerebral blood volume). Also, cerebral oxygen delivery before and after ductus closure was calculated. Before ductus closure there was a left-to-right shunt with a mean +/- SEM of 41 +/- 20 % of total body blood flow. Closure of the ductus resulted in an immediate increase in mean arterial blood pressure and carotid artery blood flow. The concentration of oxyhemoglobin increased and the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin decreased, representing increased cerebral oxygen supply. The concentration of total hemoglobin was unchanged, representing unchanged cerebral blood volume. There {{was an increase in}} cerebral oxygen delivery.

The pretransplant group included 45 patients (average age, 38 months) supported with <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> and listed for transplantation (31 heart, 8 lung, and 6 heart-lung), and the post-transplant group included 20 patients (average age, 83 months) who required <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> after thoracic organ transplantation (12 heart, 6 lung, and 2 heart-lung transplants). Hospital course and outcomes were evaluated. Results: With regard to pretransplant <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation,</b> patients listed for heart transplants were more likely to survive to transplantation than were those listed for lung or heart-lung transplants (12 / 31 [39 %] vs 1 / 14 [7 %], P =. 03).

Overall survival to discharge was 48 %. Indication for <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> was the strongest predictor of survival to discharge, with 81 % of patients cannulated for hypoxemia but only 29 % of those cannulated for hypotension surviving to discharge. Specifically, patients cannulated for shunt obstruction had the highest survival (83 %). ConclusionsOverall survival to discharge for patients with shunted single-ventricle physiology is similar to survival reported in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry for all infants supported with cardiac <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation.</b> Thus, shunted single-ventricle physiology should not be considered a contraindication to <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation.</b> Patients cannulated for hypoxemia, particularly shunt thrombosis, had markedly improved survival compared with those supported primarily for hypotension/cardiovascular collapse. Survival did not differ depending on anatomic diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the relationship between the frequency and total volume of intravascular volume administration and the development of intracranial hemorrhage during <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation.</b> METHODS: In a retrospective, matched, case-control study, 24 newborns who developed an intracranial hemorrhage during <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> treatment were compared with 40 control subjects. Both groups were analyzed for gestational age, gender, race, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, birth weight, cardiopulmonary resuscitation before <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation,</b> age at the start of treatment, duration of treatment, worst arterial blood gas sample preceding treatment, activated clotting time values, need for platelet transfusions, mean blood pressure, and the use of inotropics and steroids before the treatment. For both groups, total number and volume of intravascular infusions of normal saline, pasteurized plasma protein solution, erythrocytes, and platelets during the first 24 hours of treatment were determined. Variables were analyzed in their relationship to intracranial hemorrhage by using univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The only statistically significant difference in patient characteristics between the case patients and control subjects was arterial blood gas values. Newborns who developed intracranial hemorrhage during the treatment received both a statistically significantly higher number and a statistically significantly higher total volume of intravascular volume administrations compared with control patients. After adjustment for pH, Paco(2), and Pao(2) in the multivariate analysis, we found a significant relation between the development of intracranial hemorrhage and > 8 infusions or > 300 mL of volume infusion in the first 8 hours and > 10 infusions in the first 24 hours of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The number and total volume of intravascular volume administration in the first 8 and 24 hours of <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> treatment are statistically significantly related to the development of intracranial hemorrhage...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveDiagnosis of {{infection}} in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is challenging in clinical practice but represents a crucial {{aspect of the}} upgrading of therapeutic options. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the role of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in the diagnosis {{of infection}} in patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and to assess the difference between venovenous and <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> settings. MethodsA case-control study was performed on 27 patients. Serum values of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein were analyzed according to the presence of infection. ResultsForty-eight percent of patients had infection. Gram-negative bacteria were the predominant pathogens, and Candida albicans was the most frequent isolated microorganism. Procalcitonin had an area under the curve of 0. 681 (P = . 0062) for the diagnosis of infection in the <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> group but failed to discriminate infection in the venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group (P = . 14). The area under the curve of C-reactive protein was 0. 707 (P < . 001) in all patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In patients receiving <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation,</b> procalcitonin had good accuracy with 1. 89 ng/mL as the cutoff (sensitivity =  87. 8 %, specificity =  50 %) and C-reactive protein with 97. 70 mg/L as the cutoff (sensitivity =  85. 3 %, specificity =  41. 6 %). The procalcitonin and C-reactive protein combined assay had a sensitivity of 87. 2 % and specificity of 25. 9 %. Four variables were identified as statistically significant predictors of infection: procalcitonin and C-reactive protein combined assay (odds ratio, 1. 184; P < . 001), age (odds ratio, 0. 980; P < . 001), presence of infection before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation implantation (odds ratio, 1. 782; P < . 001), and duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (odds ratio, 1. 056; P < . 001). ConclusionsTraditional and emerging inflammatory biomarkers, especially if compounded in the procalcitonin and C-reactive protein combined assay, can aid in the diagnosis of infection in patients undergoing <b>venoarterial</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation...</b>|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{application}} of <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> in adults has been increasing, but infections occurring during <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> use are rarely described. MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed the prospectively collected data on nosocomial infection surveillance of 334 patients aged 16 {{years or more}} undergoing their first <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> for more than 48 hours at a university hospital from 1996 to 2007 for respiratory (20. 4 %) and cardiac (79. 6 %) support. ResultsDuring a total of 2559 <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> days, 55 episodes of infections occurred in 45 patients (13. 5 %), including 38 bloodstream (14. 85 per 1000 <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> days), 6 surgical site, 4 respiratory tract, 3 urinary tract, and 4 other infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (16. 7 %) and Candida species (14. 6 %) were the predominant blood isolates. In stepwise logistic regression analysis, longer duration of <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> use (odds ratio 1. 003; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 001 – 1. 005; P = . 004), mechanical complications (odds ratio, 4. 849; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 569 – 14. 991; P = . 006), autoimmune disease (odds ratio, 6. 997; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 541 – 31. 766; P = . 012), and venovenous mode (odds ratio, 4. 473; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 001 – 19. 977; P = . 050) were independently associated with a higher risk for infections during <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> use. Overall in-hospital mortality was 68. 3 %, and its independent risk factors included older age (odds ratio, 1. 037; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 021 – 1. 054; P < . 001), neurologic complications (odds ratio, 51. 153; 95 % confidence interval, 6. 773 – 386. 329; P < . 001), and vascular complications (odds ratio, 1. 922; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 112 – 3. 320; P < . 001), but not infections during <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> use. ConclusionsBloodstream infection {{was the most common}} infection during <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> use. Duration of <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation,</b> mechanical complications, autoimmune disease, and venovenous mode seemed to be independently associated with infections...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundIndications for <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> therapy have {{expanded}} to include cardiopulmonary arrest and support after congenital heart surgery. Data from a national registry have reported that cardiac patients have the poorest survival of all <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> recipients. Concerns have been raised about the appropriateness of such an aggressive strategy, {{especially in light of}} the high costs and potential for long-term neurologic disability. We reviewed our experience with salvage cardiac <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> to determine the cost-utility, which accounts for both costs and quality of life. MethodsMedical records of patients with congenital heart disease receiving salvage cardiac <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> between January 2000 and May 2004 were reviewed. Charges for all medical care after the institution of <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> were determined and converted to costs by published standards. The quality-of-life status of survivors was determined with the Health Utilities Index Mark II. ResultsSalvage cardiac <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> was instituted in 32 patients (18 for cardiopulmonary arrest and 14 for cardiac failure after heart surgery) at a median age of 2. 0 months (range, 4 days to 5. 1 years). Congenital heart disease was present in 27 (84 %). The mean duration of <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> support was 5. 1 ± 4. 1 days. Survival to hospital discharge was 50 %, including 1 patient bridged to heart transplantation. Survival to 1 year was 47 %. The mean score of the Health Utilities Index for the survivors was 0. 75 ± 0. 19 (range, 0. 41 – 1. 0). The median cost for hospital stay after the institution of <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> was $ 156, 324 per patient. The calculated cost-utility for salvage <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> in this population was $ 24, 386 per quality-adjusted life-year saved, which would be considered within the range of accepted cost-efficacy (<$ 50, 000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved). ConclusionsSalvage cardiac <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>oxygenation</b> results in reasonable survival and is justified on a cost-utility basis...|$|R
