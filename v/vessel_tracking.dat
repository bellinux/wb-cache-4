50|$|Currents - On {{a global}} scale, vessels making long voyages must take major ocean current {{circulation}} into account. Major oceanic currents, like the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean and the Kuroshio Current in the Pacific Ocean require {{planning for the}} effect {{that they will have}} on a transiting <b>vessel's</b> <b>track.</b> Likewise, tides affect a <b>vessel's</b> <b>track,</b> especially in areas with large tidal ranges, like the Bay of Fundy or along Southeast Alaska, or where the tide flows through straits, like Deception Pass in Puget Sound. Mariners use tide and current tables to inform their navigation. Before the advent of motors, it was advantageous for sailing vessels to enter or leave port or to pass through a strait with the tide.|$|R

In this article, we describe how expert knowledge can be used to determine models for automatic SA. The knowledge about situations of interest is modeled as an ontology, which can be transformed into a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). The main challenge of this transformation is the determination of the structure and the parameter settings of the DBN.

It is often desired to sense fish in other directions, for example, to assess components of the fish stock which may be avoiding the surveying vessel.

Such a sonar would be carried in a towed body, allowing detection and localization throughout the plane transverse to the <b>vessel</b> <b>track.</b> Beam patterns, equivalent beam angles and other measures of performance are computed {{for a range of}} frequencies and aperture sizes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for pattern extraction and anomaly detection in mari- time vessel traffic, based on the theory of potential fields. Potential fields are used to rep- resent and model normal, i. e. correct, behaviour in maritime transportation, observed in historical <b>vessel</b> <b>tracks.</b> The recorded paths of each maritime vessel generate potentials based on metrics such as geographical location, course, velocity, and type of vessel, resulting in a potential-based model of maritime traffic patterns. A prototype system STRAND, developed for this study, computes and displays distinctive traffic patterns as potential fields on a geographic representation of the sea. The system builds a model of normal behaviour, by collating and smoothing historical <b>vessel</b> <b>tracks.</b> The resulting visual presentation exposes distinct patterns of normal behaviour inherent in the recorded maritime traffic data. Based on the created model of normality, the system can then perform anomaly detection on current real-world maritime traffic data. Anomalies are detected as conflicts between vessel 9 ̆ 2 s potential in live data, and the local history-based potential field. The resulting detection performance is tested on AIS maritime tracking data from the Baltic region, and varies {{depending on the type}} of potential. The potential field based approach contributes to maritime situational awareness and enables automatic detection. The results show that anomalous behaviours in maritime traffic can be detected using this method, with varying performance, necessitating further study...|$|R

40|$|Illegal {{discharge}} of bilge waters {{is a significant}} source of oil and other environmental pollutants in Canadian and international waters. Imaging satellites are commonly used to monitor large areas to detect oily discharges from vessels, off-shore platforms and other sources. While remotely sensed imagery provides a snap-shot picture useful for detecting a spill or the presence of vessels in the vicinity, it is difficult to directly associate a vessel to an observed spill unless the vessel is observed while the discharge is occurring. The situation then becomes more challenging with increased vessel traffic as multiple vessels may be associated with a spill event. By combining multiple sources of vessel location data, such as Automated Information Systems (AIS), Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) and SAR-based ship detection, with spill detections and drift models we have created a system that associates detected spill events with vessels in the area using a probabilistic model that intersects <b>vessel</b> <b>tracks</b> and spill drift trajectories in both time and space. Working with the Canadian Space Agency and the Canadian Ice Service’s Integrated Satellite Tracking of Pollution (ISTOP) program, we use spills observed in Canadian waters to demonstrate the investigative value of augmenting spill detections with temporally sequenced <b>vessel</b> and spill <b>tracking</b> information...|$|R
