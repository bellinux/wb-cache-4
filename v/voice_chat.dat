An Xbox One controller must be used, but Windows-compatible headsets and microphones {{can be used}} for <b>voice</b> <b>chat.</b> Games requiring Kinect are not supported, while Game DVR and online streaming are not available while using this functionality.|$|E
5|$|The game {{offers a}} large range of enemies and {{different}} stages. It also features online multiplayer modes, such as Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, and Siege (in which the player storms the opponent's base {{and tries to}} destroy the power core inside).

A linear {{measure of a}} player's experience with the matchmade portion {{of the game and}} each particular playlist is also tracked (denoted as EXP). To help players have an enjoyable time online, several peace-of-mind features are implemented within easy reach, such as avoid/feedback options on a player's service record, as well as <b>voice</b> <b>chat</b> mute straight from the in-game scoreboard. Like Halo 2, Halo 3 supports downloadable content and updates.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime Hunters {{features}} a multiplayer mode that supports {{up to four}} players and includes <b>voice</b> <b>chat</b> capability. In it, the player is able to control Samus or one of six other bounty hunters featured in the single-player mode. Each bounty hunter has a unique alternative form, such as Samus's Morph Ball, and a special weapon. The game host can set options for point and time limits, and restrict the use of radar. Computer-controlled players of varying skill levels {{can be added to}} games if the minimum of four players is not met.|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} more first-person shooter aspects {{than the previous}} titles in the Metroid Prime series, with removal of assisted aiming, more action-oriented gameplay, and various multiplayer modes. It was created to utilize the Nintendo DS hardware, such as Wi-Fi and <b>voice</b> <b>chat</b> capabilities, and introduced other bounty hunters with unique weapons and alternative forms. Metroid Prime Hunters was announced by Nintendo at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo. A pack-in demo version of the game, titled Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt, was included with the Nintendo DS when it launched in November 2004.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, massively {{multiplayer}} online games (MMOGs) {{have become}} more and more popular. Many techniques have been proposed to enhance the experience of using MMOGs, such as realistic graphics, vivid ani-mations, and player communication tools, etc. However, in most MMOGs, communication between players is still based on text, which is unnatural and inconvenient. In this paper, we propose the concept of AOI <b>voice</b> <b>chatting</b> for MMOGs. The term AOI stands for the area of interest; a player in the MMOG only pays attention to his/her AOI. By AOI <b>voice</b> <b>chatting,</b> a player can easily <b>chat</b> by <b>voice</b> with other plays in the AOI. This improves the way players communicate with one another and provides a more realis-tic virtual environment. We also propose two peer-to-peer schemes, namely QuadCast and SectorCast, to achieve ef-ficient AOI <b>voice</b> <b>chatting</b> for MMOGs. We perform simu-lation experiments to show that the proposed schemes have reasonable end-to-end delay and affordable bandwidth con-sumption. 1...|$|R

5|$|When using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection {{for online}} multiplayer, the player can choose between a match with a random {{opponent}} {{from around the}} world, or a match with someone that the player has exchanged friend codes with. Worldwide matches are limited to two players, with the weather conditions being randomly generated and a map randomly chosen from a set list. Worldwide match players can choose if they want an opponent close to their skill level or to play against an opponent regardless of skill level. When playing with a friend, more options are opened up to allow greater customization of the match, such as the type of weather and {{the duration of the}} match. <b>Voice</b> <b>chat</b> is only supported when playing with a friend, and is unavailable during worldwide online play. However, Caulder can not be used in ONLINE multiplayer due to his extreme advantages.|$|E

25|$|Avatars can {{communicate}} via local chat, group chat, global instant messaging (known as IM), and voice (public, private and group). Chatting {{is used for}} localized public conversations between two or more avatars, and is visible to any avatar within a given distance. IMs are used for private conversations, either between two avatars, or {{among the members of}} a group, or even between objects and avatars. Unlike chatting, IM communication does not depend on the participants being within a certain distance of each other. As of version 1.18.1.2, <b>voice</b> <b>chat,</b> both local and IM, was also available.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the aims}} of the {{developers}} was to create a world which doesn't encourage any particular kind of behavior from players. They considered implementing a system similar to DayZ in which players who kill other players get unique outfits that identify them as 'bandits', or possibly a rating or color-coded system. However, the developers ultimately rejected all of these, as they felt it would detract from player freedom. Instead, they found to their surprise that the implementation of <b>voice</b> <b>chat</b> had a noticeable effect on player behavior. With the ability to communicate, many players would no longer kill each other on sight out of fear.|$|E
