40|$|The nucleocapsid (N) protein of bovine {{respiratory}} syncytial virus (BRSV) in the baculovirus {{expression system}} was evaluated {{as a source of}} antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (RSV) antibodies. The recombinant N protein was purified from infected-cell extracts by sucrose gradient centrifugation and used in the ELISA for the detection of antibodies to various RSV strains. The ELISA was compared with the virus neutralization (<b>VN)</b> <b>test</b> for determining BRSV antibodies in 10 consecutive serum samples from four calves vaccinated with a live modified BRSV vaccine and from two nonvaccinated control calves. The ELISA compared favorably with the <b>VN</b> <b>test</b> for detecting serological responses. All serum samples which were positive in the <b>VN</b> <b>test</b> were also positive in the ELISA. None of the serum samples collected from the two nonvaccinated calves reacted in the ELISA. To determine the usefulness of the ELISA for epidemiological studies, 58 cattle serum samples were tested in the ELISA and the <b>VN</b> <b>test.</b> Approximately 94 % (42 of 45) of field serum samples which were positive in the ELISA were also positive in the <b>VN</b> <b>test.</b> No case was found in which the ELISA result was negative and the <b>VN</b> <b>test</b> result was positive.

40|$|A {{competitive}} {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (c-ELISA) {{was developed}} {{as an alternative to}} the viral neutralization (<b>VN)</b> <b>test</b> for rapid and simple detection of antibodies to rabies virus. The competitor antibody in the c-ELISA was a biotinylated monoclonal antibody to the nucleoprotein of rabies virus. Initial comparisons showed a high correlation between titers obtained with the <b>VN</b> <b>test</b> and the c-ELISA (n = 88, r = 0. 90), indicating that the c-ELISA could be used as a reliable substitute for the <b>VN</b> <b>test.</b> To evaluate the immune status of Japanese dogs to rabies virus, a total of 1, 019 serum samples were collected from domestic dogs in 1994 and tested for antibodies with the c-ELISA. Overall, 84. 8 % of the dogs had antibodies against rabies virus, indicating that the vaccination strategy for preventing rabies outbreaks in domestic dogs is probably sufficient in Japan. Dogs receiving final vaccinations a year or more previously were 48. 3 and 90. 3 % positive for antibodies when vaccinated once only or two or more times, respectively. This suggests that almost all dogs vaccinated twice or more remain seropositive for over 1 year in Japan...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to conduct serosurveillance for tick-borne {{encephalitis}} virus (TBEV) in Mongolia, to isolate TBEV by in vivo methods and determine subtypes of TBEV.

40|$|Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is {{a member}} of the Paramyxovirinae {{subfamily}} and can infect most species of birds. It has been a great threat for the poultry industry all around the world. In this report, we successfully produced infectious pseudotyped pNL 4 - 3 -Luc-R 2 E 2 (HIV-Luc) viruses with the HN and F envelope proteins of NDV. Further investigation revealed the cytoplasmic domains of HN and F, especially HN, plays a significant role in the infection efficiency of these pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses. Replacement of, or direct fusion to the cytoplasmic domain of the HN protein by that of vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) could greatly enhance or destroy the infective potential of HN and F-pseudotyped (NDV-pseudotyped) HIV-Luc virus. We further established a novel neutralization assay to evaluate neutralizing antibodies against NDV with the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses. Comparative neutralization data indicate that the results determined by using the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses are as reliable as those by the conventional virus-neutralization assay (<b>VN</b> <b>test)</b> with native NDV.

40|$|The canine {{respiratory}} coronavirus (CRCoV) {{is one of}} many coronaviruses circulating among {{animals and}} was discovered in the UK in 2003 by Erles et all 1. Like every coronavirus, CRCoV contains a single-stranded RNA molecule, a capsid and projecting spikes that give the virus its specific appearance in electron micrographs. Coronaviruses are classified into three different antigenic groups and can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic and even neurological symptoms in humans and animals. The CRCoV belongs to group 2 a and is genetically very similar to the bovine coronavirus. Group 2 coronaviruses have an additional protein, the hemagglutin-esterase protein (HE-protein) 2, 3. CRCov itself causes no or only mild respiratory symptoms like coughing, sneezing and rhinitis, but in combination with other pathogens, severe clinical signs can be seen. It is thought that CRCoV plays a role in the canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD). The most important pathogens causing CIRD are canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV- 2), canine influenza virus (CIV) and Bordetella bronchiseptica. These pathogens can cause (severe) clinical signs on their own, but can invade the body much more easy when the respiratory tract is made vulnerable by, for example, the CRCoV 4. In a couple of countries, the seroprevalence of infections with the CRCoV was already studied 5 - 9. The seroprevalences range from 17, 8 % in Japan to 59, 1 % in Canada. In the Netherlands there are no data on the seroprevalence and during this study this seroprevalence was determined using Virus Neutralization tests. The aim of the current study was also to develop an ELISA based on the HE protein of the Bovine coronavirus to determine if these results correlate with the results of the <b>VN</b> <b>tests.</b> Also it was tried to develop an ELISA based on the HE protein of the CRCoV itself and these results were also compared to the results of the BCoV-HE+ ELISA and the <b>VN</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine trend and homogeneity through the analysis of rainfall variability patterns in Iran. The study presents a review on the application of homogeneity and seasonal time series analysis methods for forecasting rainfall variations. Trend and homogeneity methods are applied in the time series analysis from collecting rainfall data to evaluating results in climate studies. For the homogeneity analysis of monthly, seasonal and annual rainfall, homogeneity tests were used in 140 stations in the 1975 – 2014 period. The homogeneity of the monthly and annual rainfall at each station was studied using the autocorrelation (ACF), and the von Neumann (<b>VN)</b> <b>tests</b> at a significance level of 0. 05. In addition, the nature of the monthly and seasonal rainfall series in Iran was studied using the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test, the Thumb test (TT), and the least squares regression (LSR) test at a significance level of 0. 05. The present results indicate that the seasonal patterns of rainfall exhibit considerable diversity across Iran. Rainfall seasonality is generally less spatially coherent than temporal patterns in Iran. The seasonal variations of rainfall decreased significantly throughout eastern and central Iran, but they increased in the west and north of Iran during the studied interval. The present study comparisons among variations of patterns with the seasonal rainfall series reveal that the variability of rainfall can be predicted by the non-trended and trended patterns...|$|R

FCoVs are ubiquitous in cat populations with a particularly high prevalence in catteries. As no information was available about the occurrence of FCoVs antibodies in Italian cats, investigations were performed in the Southern of Italy. One hundred sera collected from cats belonging to catteries or community shelters and to households in the region of Apulia were tested for FCoV type I and II antibodies.

Pigs were inoculated intranasally with sw/Belgium/ 1 / 98 (H 1 N 1) 4 weeks before challenge with duck/Minnesota/ 1525 / 81 (H 5 N 1). While the viruses failed to cross-react in HI and <b>VN</b> <b>tests,</b> the H 1 N 1 infection induced high levels of H 5 N 1 cross-reactive NI antibodies. Cross-reactive CMI was demonstrated by measurements of lymphoproliferation and IFN-gamma secretion after in vitro restimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

The nested PCR used in the study appeared to be significantly more sensitive at detecting the presence of the virus in both the tissues and the inoculated Vero cell cultures compared to the detection of gross cytopathic changes as observed in infected Vero cell culture. No cytopathic changes were seen in the inoculated avian cell cultures. Following primary inoculation of the chickens there was a weak antibody response 15 days post inoculation, however following reinoculation with inactivated WNV and adjuvant there was a substantial increase in the neutralising antibody titres when tested two weeks later. The results obtained suggested that the PRNT was more sensitive than the conventional <b>VN</b> <b>test.</b> Based on detection of virus and serology {{there was no evidence of}} viral transmission to the close contact controls. It can be concluded that the PCR used in this study was more sensitive than virus isolation for the detection of WNV whilst the PRNT also appeared more sensitive than the conventional <b>VN</b> <b>test...</b>|$|E
40|$|Network {{protocols}} {{have historically}} been developed on an ad-hoc basis, and cloud computing is no exception. A fundamental management protocol, not yet standardized, that cloud providers need to run to support wide-area virtual network services is the virtual network (VN) embedding protocol. In this paper, we use decomposition theory to provide a unifying architecture for the VN embedding problem. We show how our architecture subsumes existing solutions, {{and how it can}} be used by cloud providers to design a distributed VN embedding protocol that adapts to different scenarios, by merely instantiating different decomposition policies. We analyze key representative tradeoffs via simulation, and with our <b>VN</b> embedding <b>testbed</b> that uses a Linux system architecture to reserve virtual node and link capacities. In contrast with existing VN embedding solutions, we found that partitioning a VN request not only increases the signaling overhead, but may decrease cloud providers' revenue. Comment: 6 page...|$|R
40|$|Osteopontin (OPN) is an arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) - {{containing}} glycoprotein encoded by {{the gene}} secreted phosphoprotein 1 (spp 1). spp 1 is expressed during embryogenesis, wound healing, and tumorigenesis; however, its in vivo functions {{are not well}} understood. Therefore, OPN null mutant mice were generated by targeted mutagenesis in embryonic stem cells. In OPN mutant mice, embryogenesis occurred normally, and mice were fertile. Since OPN shares receptors with vitronectin (<b>VN),</b> we <b>tested</b> for compensation by creating mice lacking both OPN and VN. The double mutants were also viable, suggesting that other RGD-containing ligands replace the embryonic loss of both proteins. We tested the healing of OPN mutants after skin incisions, where spp 1 was upregulated as early as 6 h after wounding. Although the tensile properties of the wounds were unchanged, ultrastructural analysis showed a significantly decreased level of debridement, greater disorganization of matrix, and an alteration of collagen fibrillogenesis leading to small diameter collagen fibrils in the OPN mutant mice. These data indicate a role for OPN in tissue remodeling in vivo, and suggest physiological functions during matrix reorganization after injury...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} August 2002, {{clinical}} {{symptoms of}} bluetongue in the sheep flocks in northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina were recorded. In an extensive testing campaign, a total of 8967 blood serra of sheep were tested {{for the presence of}} anti-bluetongue virus antibodies using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) and the standard agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test.

40|$|Abstract. The {{diagnostic}} {{performance of}} 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (gX-T, gX-H) for anti-bodies to pseudorabies virus (PRV) glycoprotein X (gX) were evaluated using 311 serum samples from a nonvaccinated quarantined herd. When the standardized virus neutralization (<b>VN)</b> <b>test,</b> which uses the Shope strain (VN Shope), {{was used as}} the comparative diagnostic standard, the gX-T test had a 7 % false-negative rate and a 52 % false-positive rate, and the gX-H test had a 19 % false-negative rate and a 19 % false-positive rate. When the <b>VN</b> <b>test</b> with a Bartha recombinant strain (VN Bartha gIIIKa) {{was used as the}} diagnostic standard, the gX-T test had a 9 % false-negative rate and a 26 % false-positive rate, and the gX-H test had a 24 % false-negative rate and a 11 % false-positive rate. Thus, the gX-T test was more sensitive and the gX-H test was more specific. Additional diagnostic tests on 79 serum samples from a noninfected herd did not produce false positives for the gX-H test, but there was an 8 % false-positive rate for the gX-T test. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that VN Bartha gIIIKa has higher sensitivity than VN Shope, without losing specificity, and thus is a better comparative diagnostic standard. When adding a suspect range to the gX-T test, using the same criteria as the suspect range for the gX-H test, the false-positive rate of the gX-T test was reduced to 5 % when evaluated versus VN Bartha gIIIKa in the infected herd and to 1 % for the PRV-negative herd. However, 18 % of the positive samples were classified as suspect (vs. 8 % for the gX-H test). In PRV eradication programs, th...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to detect the presence of avian pneumovirus (APV) antibodies in commercial poultry farms using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and virus neutralization test (VN). Eighty seven chicken serum samples were collected from several commercial poultry farms in Al-Qassium area, Saudi Arabia during 2007 - 2008. The serum samples were collected from birds of various ages (from one-day old to 62 weeks of age). Antibodies to APV were detected in 50 % (8 out of 16) by both ELISA and virus neutralization (<b>VN)</b> <b>test</b> at farms in birds of 11 - 18 weeks of age only. The total positive samples were 8 / 87 (9. 2 %) of all examined samples.

40|$|Abstract Background Chicken {{red blood}} cells (RBCs) are {{commonly}} used in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests to measure hemagglutinating antibodies against influenza viruses. The use of horse RBCs in the HI test can reportedly increase its sensitivity when testing human sera for avian influenza antibodies. This study aims to compare the proportion of positives detected and the agreement between two HI tests using either chicken or horse {{red blood cells}} for antibody detection in sera of ducks experimentally infected or naturally exposed to Indonesian H 5 subtype avian influenza virus. In addition, comparison with a virus neutralisation (<b>VN)</b> <b>test</b> was conducted with the experimental sera. Results In the experimental study, the proportion of HI antibody-positive ducks increased slightly, from 0. 57 when using chicken RBCs to 0. 60 when using horse RBCs. The HI tests indicated almost perfect agreement (kappa[*]=[*] 0. 86) when results were dichotomised (titre[*]≥[*] 4 log 2), and substantial agreement (weighted kappa[*]=[*] 0. 80) for log titres. Overall agreements between the two HI tests were greater than between either of the HI tests and the <b>VN</b> <b>test.</b> The use of horse RBCs also identified {{a higher proportion of}} antibody positives in field duck sera (0. 08, compared to chicken RBCs 0. 02), with also almost perfect agreements for dichotomized results (Prevalence and bias adjusted Kappa (PABAK) [*]=[*] 0. 88) and for log titres (weighted PABAK[*]=[*] 0. 93), respectively. Factors that might explain observed differences in the proportion of antibody-positive ducks and in the agreements between HI tests are discussed. Conclusion In conclusion, we identified a good agreement between HI tests. However, when horse RBCs were used, a higher proportion of sera was positive (titre[*]≥[*] 4 log 2) than using chicken RBCs, especially during the early response against H 5 N 1 virus. The HRBC-HI might be more responsive in identifying early H 5 N 1 HPAI serological response and could be a recommended assay for avian influenza sero-surveillance in both wild and domestic birds. </p...|$|E
40|$|Conference Theme: Nature and Nurture in Brain FunctionsPeri{{neuronal}} nets (PN) {{were crucial}} for restricting neuronal plasticity during development. Our {{study of the}} central vestibular nucleus (VN) found consolidation of PN around GABAergic interneurons as from postnatal day (P) 9 of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. This was accompanied by progressive localization of semaphorin 3 A (Sema 3 A) to chondroitin sulphate moieties (CS) of PN. We hypothesized that PN-CS binding of Sema 3 A limits the action of Sema 3 A as a plasticity-inducing factor in the <b>VN.</b> We <b>tested</b> for structural plasticity in VN explant cultures, treated with Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) and/ or Sema 3 A. Parallel cultures were fixed for assessment of neurite arborization and growth. Increase in these parameters suggested involvement of CS and Sema 3 A in the structural plasticity of VN neurons. To study the impact of PN-CS/Sema 3 A at the circuit level, the SD rats were assessed {{for the emergence of}} negative geotaxis as a readout for graviception. We observed negative geotaxis as early as P 9, in correlation with consolidation of PN around GABAergic neurons in the VN. ChABC/Sema 3 A-treated rats showed delayed emergence of negative geotaxis, similar to effects of bicuculline but contrasting those of muscimol. Delayed emergence of negative geotaxis also correlated to the postponed formation of PN after ChABC treatment. Our results suggest that trapping of plasticity-inducing Sema 3 A onto PN-CS translates to the closure of plasticity in the graviceptive circuit. [Grant Support: HKRGC 17125115 M & 777911 M...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{work of this}} study focuses on the design and implementation technology of terminal in Vector Network (VN) based indows platform. The VN {{is a kind of}} new communication network with vector address as the switching adon Wdress. The premise of successful deployment of VN is its integration with the current IP networks, so it is necessary to study the implementation technology of VN terminal on the base of IP terminal. Firstly, a kind of software implementation method of VN terminal and a kind of integration method of VN and IP networks named “IP over VN” were proposed in this study. Secondly, the VN driver module was designed and implemented based on the NDIS driver interface and the key technique in the implementation was summarized. Finally, the experiment network was built to test the functions of <b>VN</b> terminal. The <b>test</b> results validated the rationality of the design and implementation scheme of VN terminal.

40|$|Haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) and virus {{neutralisation}} (VN) assays {{are used to}} evaluate immunogenicity of pandemic H 1 N 1 vaccines; however these bioassays are poorly standardised leading to inter-laboratory variation. A candidate International Standard (IS) for antibody to H 1 N 1 pdm virus (09 / 194) was prepared from pooled sera of subjects who had either recovered from H 1 N 1 pdm infection or who had been immunised with an adjuvanted subunit vaccine prepared from reassortant virus NYMC X- 179 A (derived from A/California/ 7 / 2009 virus). Ten laboratories from seven countries tested the candidate IS, 09 / 194 and a panel of human sera by HI and VN using the A/California/ 7 / 2009 virus (six laboratories) and/or the reassortant virus NYMC X- 179 A (ten laboratories). As expected, the inter-laboratory variability for HI and VN assay results was high. For results of antibody tests to NYMC X- 179 A, the % geometric coefficient of variation (%GCV) for 09 / 194 between laboratories was 83 % for HI and 192 % for <b>VN.</b> For <b>tests</b> of all sera, the median %GCV ranged from 95 to 345 % for HI (80 -fold variation) and 204 to 383 % for VN (109 -fold variation), but for the titres relative to 09 / 194 the median %GCV was much reduced (HI 34 - 231 %; VN 44 - 214 %). For tests of antibody to the A/California/ 7 / 2009 wild type virus there were similar reductions in %GCV when 09 / 194 was used. These results suggest that 09 / 194 will be of use to standardise assays of antibody to A/California/ 7 / 2009 vaccine and 09 / 194 has now been established by WHO as an IS for antibody to A/California/ 7 / 2009 with an assigned potency of 1300 IU per ml...|$|R
