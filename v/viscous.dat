5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much {{closer look at}} the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus' craters are heavily degraded through <b>viscous</b> relaxation and fracturing. <b>Viscous</b> relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as craters only by a raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater {{is a prime example of}} a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E
5|$|Earwax {{is partly}} {{composed}} of sebum produced by glands {{in the ear}} canal. These secretions are <b>viscous</b> and have a high lipid content, which provides good lubrication.|$|E
5|$|El Greco painted {{many of his}} {{paintings}} on fine canvas and employed a <b>viscous</b> oil medium. He painted with the usual pigments of his period such as azurite, lead-tin-yellow, vermilion, madder lake, ochres and red lead, but he seldom used the expensive natural ultramarine.|$|E
5|$|Glasses {{and certain}} types of {{plastics}} are commonly welded materials. Unlike metals, which have a specific melting point, glasses and plastics have a melting range, called the glass transition. When heating the solid material into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the glass transition, {{it will become a}} very thick, sluggish, <b>viscous</b> liquid. Typically, this <b>viscous</b> liquid will have very little surface tension, becoming a sticky, honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|E
5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is {{the flow}} of a <b>viscous</b> fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of <b>viscous</b> drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{physics of}} {{accretion}} disks encounters some problems. The {{most important one}} is how the material, which is accreted by the protostar, loses its angular momentum. One possible explanation suggested by Hannes Alfvén was that angular momentum was shed by the solar wind during its T Tauri star phase. The momentum is transported to the outer parts of the disk by <b>viscous</b> stresses. Viscosity is generated by macroscopic turbulence, but the precise mechanism that produces this turbulence is not well understood. Another possible process for shedding angular momentum is magnetic braking, where the spin of the star is transferred into the surrounding disk via that star's magnetic field. The main processes responsible for {{the disappearance of the}} gas in disks are <b>viscous</b> diffusion and photo-evaporation.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer on Cassini {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} liquid ethane beyond doubt in Ontario Lacus. On December 21, 2008, Cassini passed directly over Ontario Lacus and observed specular reflection in radar. The strength of the reflection saturated the probe's receiver, indicating that the lake level did not vary by more than 3mm (implying either that surface winds were minimal, or the lake's hydrocarbon fluid is <b>viscous).</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{mammalian}} cells, {{the average}} {{diameter of the}} nucleus is approximately 6 micrometres (µm), which occupies about 10% of the total cell volume. The <b>viscous</b> liquid within it is called nucleoplasm (or karyolymph), and is similar in composition to the cytosol found outside the nucleus. It appears as a dense, roughly spherical or irregular organelle. The composition by dry weight of the nucleus is approximately: DNA 9%, RNA 1%, Histone Protein 11%, Residual Protein 14%, Acidic Proteins 65%.|$|E
5|$|Octopus blood {{contains}} the copper-rich protein haemocyanin to transport oxygen. This makes the blood very <b>viscous</b> {{and it requires}} considerable pressure to pump it round the body; octopuses' blood pressures can exceed 75 mmHg. In cold conditions with low oxygen levels, haemocyanin transports oxygen more efficiently than haemoglobin. The haemocyanin is dissolved in the plasma instead of being carried within blood cells, and gives the blood a bluish colour.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the five}} major volcanoes in Washington, only Glacier Peak and Mount St. Helens have had large eruptions {{in the past}} 15,000 years. Since both volcanoes {{generate}} magma of dacitic origin, the <b>viscous</b> magma builds up since it cannot flow through the eruptive vent. Gradually, the pressure grows, culminating in an explosion that ejects materials such as tephra, which in its simplest form, is ash.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{medication}} such as NSAIDs and paracetamol (acetaminophen) {{helps in}} the management of pain associated with strep throat. <b>Viscous</b> lidocaine may also be useful. While steroids may help with the pain, they are not routinely recommended. Aspirin may be used in adults but is not recommended in children due to the risk of Reye syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Submarine {{volcanism}} {{is driven}} by various processes. Volcanoes near plate boundaries and mid-ocean ridges are built by the decompression melting of mantle rock that rises on an upwelling portion of a convection cell to the crustal surface. Eruptions associated with subducting zones, meanwhile, are driven by subducting plates that add volatiles to the rising plate, lowering its melting point. Each process generates different rock; mid-ocean ridge volcanics are primarily basaltic, whereas subduction flows are mostly calc-alkaline, and more explosive and <b>viscous.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tactile sensory {{perception}} in divers may be impaired {{by the environmental}} protection suit and low temperatures. The combination of instability, equipment, neutral buoyancy and resistance to movement by the inertial and <b>viscous</b> effects of the water encumbers the diver. Cold causes losses in sensory and motor function and distracts from and disrupts cognitive activity. The ability to exert large and precise force is reduced.|$|E
5|$|The {{thickness}} of the velocity boundary layer is normally defined as {{the distance from the}} solid body to {{the point at which the}} <b>viscous</b> flow velocity is 99% of the freestream velocity (the surface velocity of an inviscid flow). Displacement Thickness is an alternative definition stating that the boundary layer represents a deficit in mass flow compared to inviscid flow with slip at the wall. It is the distance by which the wall would have to be displaced in the inviscid case to give the same total mass flow as the <b>viscous</b> case. The no-slip condition requires the flow velocity at the surface of a solid object be zero and the fluid temperature be equal to the temperature of the surface. The flow velocity will then increase rapidly within the boundary layer, governed by the boundary layer equations, below.|$|E
5|$|The <b>viscous</b> {{nature of}} airflow reduces the local {{velocities}} on a surface and {{is responsible for}} skin friction. The layer of air over the wing's surface that is slowed down or stopped by viscosity, is the boundary layer. There are {{two different types of}} boundary layer flow: laminar and turbulent.|$|E
5|$|Using {{a mass of}} examples, Thompson {{pointed out}} {{correlations}} between biological forms and mechanical phenomena. He showed the similarity in the forms of jellyfish and the forms of drops of liquid falling into <b>viscous</b> fluid, and between the internal supporting structures in the hollow bones of birds and well-known engineering truss designs. He described phyllotaxis (numerical relationships between spiral structures in plants) {{and its relationship to}} the Fibonacci sequence.|$|E
5|$|Primary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM), {{also known}} as glue ear, {{consists}} of a highly <b>viscous</b> mucus plug which fills the dog's middle ear and may cause the tympanic membrane to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of them. Because the pain and other sensations {{in the head and}} neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers which actually have PSOM and not SM.|$|E
25|$|Highly <b>viscous</b> lavas do {{not usually}} flow as liquid, and usually form {{explosive}} fragmental ash or tephra deposits. However, a degassed <b>viscous</b> lava or one which erupts somewhat hotter than usual may form a lava flow.|$|E
25|$|Viscosity {{is a key}} melt {{property}} in understanding the behaviour of magmas. More silica-rich melts are typically more polymerized, with more linkage of silica tetrahedra, and so are more <b>viscous.</b> Dissolution of water drastically reduces melt viscosity. Higher-temperature melts are less <b>viscous.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Viscous</b> fibers thicken the {{contents}} of the intestinal tract and may attenuate the absorption of sugar, reduce sugar response after eating, and reduce lipid absorption (notably shown with cholesterol absorption). Their use in food formulations is often limited to low levels, due to their viscosity and thickening effects. Some <b>viscous</b> fibers may also be partially or fully fermented within the intestinal tract (guar gum, beta-glucan, glucomannan and pectins), but some <b>viscous</b> fibers are minimally or not fermented (modified cellulose such as methylcellulose and psyllium).|$|E
25|$|All real fluids (except superfluids) {{offer some}} {{resistance}} to shearing and therefore are <b>viscous.</b> For teaching and explanatory purposes {{it is helpful to}} use the concept of an inviscid fluid or an ideal fluid which offers no {{resistance to shearing}} and so is not <b>viscous.</b>|$|E
25|$|If the gas or {{liquid is}} very <b>viscous</b> (resulting in {{turbulent}} differential motion), {{the reversal of}} the magnetic field may not be very periodic. This {{is the case with}} the Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by turbulent currents in a <b>viscous</b> outer core.|$|E
25|$|Viscosity is {{associated}} with the frictional forces in a flow. In some flow fields, <b>viscous</b> effects are very small, and approximate solutions may safely neglect <b>viscous</b> effects. These approximations are called inviscid flows. Flows for which viscosity is not neglected are called <b>viscous</b> flows. Finally, aerodynamic problems may also be classified by the flow environment. External aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes (e.g. around an airplane wing), while internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages inside solid objects (e.g. through a jet engine).|$|E
25|$|<b>Viscous</b> {{lidocaine}} relieves pain by numbing the mucus membranes.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of viscosity on the flow dictates a third classification. Some problems may encounter only very small <b>viscous</b> effects, {{in which case}} viscosity can {{be considered to be}} negligible. The approximations to these problems are called inviscid flows. Flows for which viscosity cannot be neglected are called <b>viscous</b> flows.|$|E
25|$|The {{viscosity}} of alcohols {{increase with}} longer carbon chains. For this reason, butanol {{is used as}} an alternative to shorter alcohols when a more <b>viscous</b> solvent is desired. The kinematic viscosity of butanol is several times higher than that of gasoline and about as <b>viscous</b> as high quality diesel fuel.|$|E
25|$|For gastritis, {{drinking}} <b>viscous</b> lidocaine {{may help}} with the pain.|$|E
25|$|The Reynolds {{number is}} a {{dimensionless}} quantity which characterises {{the magnitude of}} inertial effects compared to the magnitude of <b>viscous</b> effects. A low Reynolds number (Re<<1) indicates that <b>viscous</b> forces are very strong compared to inertial forces. In such cases, inertial forces are sometimes neglected; this flow regime is called Stokes or creeping flow.|$|E
25|$|In fluid dynamics, the Stokes {{boundary}} layer, or oscillatory boundary layer, {{refers to}} the boundary layer close to a solid wall in oscillatory flow of a <b>viscous</b> fluid. Or, it {{refers to the}} similar case of an oscillating plate in a <b>viscous</b> fluid at rest, with the oscillation direction(s) parallel to the plate.|$|E
25|$|Adding <b>viscous</b> polysaccharides to {{carbohydrate}} meals {{can reduce}} post-prandial blood glucose concentrations. Wheat and maize but not oats modify glucose absorption, the rate being {{dependent upon the}} particle size. The reduction in absorption rate with guar gum {{may be due to}} the increased resistance by <b>viscous</b> solutions to the convective flows created by intestinal contractions.|$|E
25|$|Felsic lavas (dacites or rhyolites) tend to {{be highly}} <b>viscous</b> (not very fluid) and are erupted as domes or short, stubby flows. <b>Viscous</b> lavas tend to form stratovolcanoes or lava domes. Lassen Peak in California {{is an example of}} a volcano formed from felsic lava and is {{actually}} a large lava dome.|$|E
25|$|Thixotropic liquids, {{that become}} less <b>viscous</b> over time when shaken, agitated, or {{otherwise}} stressed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the ratio}} of the steady {{inertial}} forces to the steady <b>viscous</b> forces.|$|E
25|$|<b>Viscous</b> Dampers {{have the}} benefit of being a {{supplemental}} damping system. They have an oval hysteretic loop and the damping is velocity dependent. While some minor maintenance is potentially required, <b>viscous</b> dampers generally {{do not need to be}} replaced after an earthquake. While more expensive than other damping technologies they can be used for both seismic and wind loads and are the most commonly used hysteric damper.|$|E
