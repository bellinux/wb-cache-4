[...] Poniewozik also noted: [...] "As we get farther into what we usually think of in pop-culture terms as 'the ’60s,' it gets harder even for a show as brilliant as Mad Men to avoid overfamiliar takes", singling out the scene where Don watches Vietnam War news reports. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said, [...] "'The Summer Man' is an episode I expect I'm {{going to need to}} revisit a time or 20 before I decide how I ultimately feel about some of its stylistic departures from the Mad Men norm", referring to {{the use of}} <b>voice-over</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> camera effect of Don's pulling away from the office when he isn't drinking.

40|$|A {{symbolic}} interaction (BLUMER, 1969; MEAD, 1934; PRUS, 1996; PRUS & GRILLS, 2003) {{approach was}} taken to study the collective event (PRUS, 1997) of creating a research-based dance on pathways to care in first episode psychosis. Viewing the co-creation of a research-based dance as collective activity attends to the processual aspects of an individual's experiences. It allowed us to study {{the process of the}} creation of <b>the</b> dance <b>and</b> its capacity to convert abstract research into concrete form and to produce generalizable abstract knowledge from the empirical research findings. Thus, through the techniques of movement, metaphor, <b>voice-over,</b> <b>and</b> music, <b>the</b> characterization of experience through dance was personal and generic, individual and collective, particular <b>and</b> trans-situational. <b>The</b> dance performance allowed us to address <b>the</b> visceral, emotional, <b>and</b> visual aspects of our research which are frequently invisible in traditional academia.

5000|$|As Karen Hollinger {{describes}} in “Film Noir, <b>Voice-Over</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Femme Fatale,” women in film noir {{are subjected to}} the psychoanalytic perspective of the male, which forces a consistent attempt to try and interpret the meaning of femaleness, {{from the point of}} view of the phallus, which is deemed a problematic perspective, since it speaks for a silenced demographic by popular culture and media. Christine Gledhill explains that there are “five features of film noir,” one of them being an “expressionist visual style and emphasis on sexuality in the photographing of women.” [...] Through this perspective and the common male voice over that film noir exhibits, it can neutralize the women’s gaze and turn the narrative into the desired male fantasy, although the obvious attempt of the female character. Through this gaze of cinema, which is a representation of reality, there is a fabrication that male is the perspective of normativity and female is considered other, as secondary and overlooked. These female actors are then created as a fictional object and then made into objects of spectacle, made for enjoyment and sexual pleasure. To combat this perspective of the female figure, the femme fatale is both very useful and problematic. The femme fatale is defined by “her dangerous, yet desirable sexual presence,” rather than the typically weak and supplemental female characters that are cast in Hollywood films. In these aesthetically loaded films, the glorification of the woman is translated into holding the “visual power” and the gaze of the audience, at times becoming the dominant character, displacing onlookers of their expectations of a sexualized female character and re-establishing the power of the weak female character that once was. This disorients the image of the erotic woman, even in the face of narrative repression.|$|E
40|$|Music {{and voices}} in Pickpocket (1951), by Robert Bresson – The French {{director}} Robert Bresson {{was known for}} his creative use of sound elements and the scanty insertion of music in his films. In films produced during the intermediary phase of his career, such as A man escaped (1956), Pickpocket (1959) and Au hasard Balthazar (1966), preexisting classical music pieces, which contain formal aspects that are analogous to their distribution in the respective films, were used as non-diegetic music. Moreover, in Pickpocket, the preexisting music by Lully also relates to the voice-in and voice-over. The voice-in {{at the end of the}} dialogues usually triggers musical excerpts, which are inserted in situations of movement and whose function resembles that of divertissements in baroque opera. We also consider the relations between voice-in and <b>voice-over</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lag between the latter and the action and the image of the main character’s diary as it is being written...|$|E
40|$|Propaganda is {{conspicuous}} {{for what}} it conceals and always cautious about what it reveals. Starting from the assumption that all documentaries on the Decroly School in Uccle (Brussels), the school Ovide Decroly (1871 - 1932) founded in 1907, are propaganda, this article tackles {{the question as to}} how to "read" this particular set of Decrolyan propaganda documentaries. The author will do that on the basis of two documentaries - Pour la vie, par la vie (1946 - 1947) and Le Jardin d'enfants a l'Ecole Decroly (1952 - 1953) - and focus on what he calls a contextualising "from within": a filmic reading as part of a historical reading. What does the "genre" of the propaganda documentary, the way these films are constructed, reveal about the Decroly Method, the Decroly School and the Decrolyans? This implies that one needs to try to unravel the "grammar" or "semiotics" of the films. As a result, this article is starting with a methodological reflection on how to read (propaganda documentary) film, after which the author outlines briefly the production context of the Decroly films. The subsequent sections relate this context to a contextualisation "from within", focusing on the <b>voice-over</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sounds, the framed images and the camera work, particularly related to the way space, children and adults are depicted, and finally the editing work, particularly referring to some striking sequences...|$|E

From this came the idea of McClure's marriage to Selma Bouvier, as she was [...] "always marrying people". Animator Mark Kirkland was particularly pleased that McClure was the star of the episode. He enjoyed interpreting Hartman's <b>voice-over</b> performances, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> episode allowed him <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other animators to [...] "open [...] up visually as a character".|$|R

40|$|Nature {{documentary}} {{has frequently}} been criticized as relentlessly normalizing and anthropomorphic, offering merely ideological reification for the viewer. Given the anxiety and uncanniness provoked by the ultimate human-decentering ramifications of evolution and ecology, psychological and historical analysis are warranted. Uncanny affect {{in the nature}} documentary is both an inherent property of the genre, given the complex status {{of the concept of}} nature, the friction between the non-human life displayed on screen and the simultaneous human presence with it through <b>voice-over</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> artifact of the camera’s point of view. Four collaboratively created nature documentaries are analyzed, each providing a different angle on how the uncanny functions within the genre. In Werner Herzog’s Grizzly Man, the death that lurks {{at the center of the}} film casts an uncanny shadow over the Alaskan landscape inhabited by Timothy Treadwell and the bears he filmed himself among, his belief in the romance of nature put to question by Herzog, with the occasional human-free shot lingering and challenging viewer projections. The Silent World, co-directed by Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Louis Malle, erupts with uncanny human frenzy after the Calypso strikes a whale, echoing the events of World War II before shifting into a mode of reverence for nature. The Australian film Two Laws, directed by Carolyn Strachan and Alessandro Cavadini, provides a model for ecological political work that opens the same potential increase in ecological mindfulness as immersion in the anti-anthropocentric ecological uncanny. The Harvard Biovision Inner Life of the Cell series of animations began initially to work to avoid the uncanny but, in attempting to more closely convey the chaotic ecology with the living cell, has recently embraced a mode of representation that renders the nanoscale world within the cell alien, yet within. ...|$|E
40|$|The diary {{film as a}} unique, personal, {{and private}} {{cinematic}} genre {{for a long time}} has not received its fair share of attention in academic research. This thesis therefore focuses mainly on the historical development, characteristics, and aesthetics of the diary film per se, conducting a critical dialogue between them in order to explore a field of study that should be clarified instead of staying ambiguous. The discussion of this thesis can be divided into two parts: first, I pay specially attention to the historical context of the diary film in the 1950 s to 1960 s in America. Combing through different film theories regarding amateurism and different personal filmmaking approaches proposed by Marie Menken, Maya Deren, and Jonas Mekas, {{the first part of the}} thesis aims to locate the origins of the diary film. Moreover, with the discovering of the early historic material of the avant-garde film movement and the diary film in Taiwan, a transnational connection of the diary film between America and Taiwan has been established. The second part of the thesis focuses on the analyses of the diary film texts from various filmmakers in America and in Taiwan across different periods of time: they include Jonas Mekas, Hollis Frampton, Saul Levine, George Kuchar, Shine Lin, and myself. By the close reading of these films, I provide concepts from different perspectives as analytic tools in the diary film research: the parenthetical structure of the <b>voice-over</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> image in the diary film, and the different modes of diary filmmaking (perceptive, retrospective, and access) in terms of temporality and technology. To conclude, this thesis not only wishes to suggest forward-looking views on this marginal field, but also to reconstruct and reinvent the research of the diary film in Taiwan...|$|E
