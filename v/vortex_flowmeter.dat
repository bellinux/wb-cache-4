40|$|The {{measurement}} uncertainty of <b>vortex</b> <b>flowmeter</b> was examined when the gas flow measured was injected with liquid. This test {{was performed in}} a multiphase flow calibration facility. A <b>vortex</b> <b>flowmeter</b> of 50 mm in diameter was installed in a 100 mm test section. The gas volume flow rate was held in 141 m 3 /h and the liquid was injected into the gas flow. The liquid volume fractions used at the gas volume flow rate were 0. 0106 %, 0. 0213 %, 0. 0355 %, 0. 0496 %, 0. 0638 %, 0. 0780 % and 0. 0922 %. The small amount of liquid in the gas as discrete droplet is called discrete liquid phase. Analysis on the vortex shedding frequency obtained from a frequency spectra showed that the strouhal values changed from 0. 305 to 0. 385 with the discrete liquid phase increasing and the total uncertainty of <b>vortex</b> <b>flowmeter</b> was from 0. 869 % to 2. 196 %.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{visualize}} the turbulent wake of various bluff bodies placed inside a circular pipe. The {{objective is to}} identify shapes which are strong vortex generators and incur minimum irrecoverable pressure loss. The shapes of the bluff bodies are chosen such that they exhibit distinct separation point for strong and stable vortex shedding. The dye used for flow visualization is a shear-thickening and high extension viscosity fluid, which can sustain turbulent separated flows. The planar illumination of the flow field with laser sheet improves the visibility of coherent structures for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the images. The vortex shedding frequency, wake width, and vortex formation length are computed from image analysis. The results highlight that streamlined shapes possess lower wake width and larger vortex formation length, whereas blunt shapes (like triangle and trapezoid) show a larger wake width and a shorter vortex formation length. The vortex shedding frequency is also measured with a piezoelectric sensor to aid flow visualization studies. The optimum location of the piezoelectric sensor is explained based on the vortex formation length to obtain high amplitude signals. Among all the shapes studied, trapezoidal bluff body {{appears to be the}} most appropriate shape with strong and stable vortex shedding.

In terms of the resolution of FBG sensor demodulation device and factors of vortex's formation, the measuring range of flowmeter is 1200 L/h~ 5000 L/h.

40|$|Piezoelectric and {{transient}} {{differential pressure}} sensors are two {{among the most}} widely employed sensors for <b>vortex</b> <b>flowmeter</b> application. The present study evaluates the performance of these two techniques under fully developed and disturbed flow conditions. Firstly, {{the location of the}} transient differential pressure sensor is optimized to obtain high amplitude signals and good linearity in Strouhal number. Empirical mode decomposition method in combination with autocorrelation decay is successfully employed at high Reynolds numbers to identify the vortex shedding frequency in presence of hydrodynamic noise. The performance of the differential pressure sensor deteriorates significantly under disturbed flow conditions at low Reynolds number due to the presence of low frequency components. This deterioration in the signal quality limits the lower operating range of the flowmeter with differential pressure sensor. The output signals of the piezoelectric sensor and differential pressure sensor under no flow condition are compared to obtain the background noise due to piping vibrations and electrical interferences. These results will help a designer to suggest robust signal processing algorithms for vortex frequency detection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Commercially {{available}} flowmeters {{are provided}} with a calibration certificate, based on stationary flow conditions and {{do not include the}} impact of installation effects like swirl, a-symmetry, and piping and flow dynamics. Flow pulsations, valve noise and mechanical pipe vibrations can have a considerable impact on flowmeter accuracy in gas as well as in liquid flows. International standards like ISO, AGA and API, available for several flowmeter principles, sometimes refer to swirl, flow and piping dynamic effects, though they do not specify allowable amplitudes or frequencies. Investigations on the impact of piping and flow dynamics on differential pressure, turbine, <b>vortex</b> and Coriolis <b>flowmeters</b> have been published at several occasions. Ultrasonic noise of control valves is well known as a potential source of errors on ultrasonic flowmeters. The impact of mechanical pipe vibrations on <b>vortex</b> and Coriolis <b>flowmeters</b> can result in large errors if vibrations occur in the operating range of the flowmeter. Investigations on several commercially available flowmeters of this type have reported these phenomena for vortex and Coriolis flow meters. Several manufacturers, operating companies and engineering contractors have expressed their interest in developing a well-defined test for this type of applications. An absolute criterion for allowable pulsations or vibrations can hardly be defined as the impact on flowmeters differs for each flow metering principle and/or size. Therefore individual criteria should be developed for each type of flowmeter and its application.

40|$|Analyses of {{unsteady}} flow in pipe systems are normally applied in case periodic pulsations {{are to be}} expected as a result of well known sources like reciprocating compressors or other positive displacement machinery. The API 618 Standard for reciprocating compressors recommends such a pulsation and mechanical response analysis to prevent unacceptable vibration levels and cyclic stresses in the piping and connected instrumentation. However the impact of pulsating flow on flowmeter accuracy is not considered and criteria for allowable pulsations at flowmeters in relation to metering errors are not specified in the present edition of the standard. Though {{it is well known that}} pulsations may have a considerable impact on traditional techniques like orifice metering, turbine and vortex flowmeters, moreover recent investigations have shown that also ultrasonic flowmeters may be influenced by pulsations. Flowmeter manufacturers do not often refer to uncertainties as a result of {{unsteady flow}}, nor do they define criteria with respect to allowable pulsation amplitudes or frequencies for their flowmeters. Amplitude thresholds can be defined for differential pressure type flowmeters and turbine flow meters without reference to pulsation frequency.

40|$|The present {{experimental}} study investigates a new configuration of <b>vortex</b> <b>flowmeter</b> {{to improve the}} turndown ratio and flow distortion sensitivity. An optimized contraction cone is introduced upstream to the vortex shedder to enhance {{the strength of the}} shed vortices and to suppress upstream flow distortion effects. A trapezoidal bluff body with two different blockage ratios (19 % and 28 %) is studied as a vortex shedder. The performance of this new configuration is studied under fully developed flow condition and also evaluated with various flow disturbances. The flow distortion is introduced with 90 degrees degree in-plane and out-of-plane elbows. Transient wall pressure measurement technique is used to capture the vortex shedding frequency. It is found that 28 % blockage ratio with optimized contraction cone is the best combination to improve the turn down ratio of vortex flow-meter. The installation of contraction cone helps in reducing the non-uniformity in the velocity profiles which improves the strength and stability of the shed vortices. Minimum measurable Reynolds number obtained with this technique is 5000 which is significantly lower than conventional vortex flowmeters. The turn down ratio achieved with this technique is 1 : 80 as opposed to 1 : 20 for conventional vortex flowmeters...|$|E
40|$|To {{reduce the}} amount of {{purchased}} fuels, more and more plants are making use of in-plant generated sources of gases. The availability of such waste gases is usually not constant, thus the total plant's mixed gas heating value swings accordingly. When this mixed gas is fed to the furnaces or boilers that are on strictly volumetric flow control loops, it causes large upsets in the heat release rate, even at a constant flow. These upsets, in turn, cause changes in process temperatures and/or pressures, resulting in off specification products and air pollution violations, and may even cause damage to equipment. The tendency is to operate routinely at a high excess air level, resulting in a much lower overall efficiency, or to even flare the gas. For many fuel gases, the heating value per standard unit volume varies linearly with the mass per standard unit volume. Perhaps a lesser realized fact it that the air required for combustion of 1000 Btu (net) heat release is almost independent of fuel molecular weight. This paper will describe the details of a technique developed by the Foxboro Company to measure the incoming fuel gas total Btu content by using a differential pressure transmitter and <b>vortex</b> <b>flowmeter</b> in series, generate a feed forward signal to maximize overall efficiency through transients, and to do it without compromising any of the safety constraints of the furnace...|$|E

40|$|Measurements of the {{response}} to inline flow oscillations of vortex shedding from certain bluff bodies have been made. Four cylinders with fixed separation points were exposed to a mean stream with controlled sinusoidal oscillations at defined frequency ratios and amplitudes. Attention was concentrated on the highly sensitive reduced velocity regime around the inverse of twice the Strouhal number, 1 / 2 S. Synchronisation of vortex formation was first established; then, for conditions at which synchronisation occured, threshold amplitude was measured. In {{order to determine the}} common and distinguishing features of bluff body shape {{the response}} from cylinders having 'zero' and finite afterbody were investigated. Finally, for a selected cylinder, the influence, in the presence of oscillations, of turbulence intensity (of defined scale), solid blockage and aspect ratio to the synchronous range were examined. Of particular interest were the changes that occur in the characteristic period of vortex formation and base pressure, relevant to the design and application of <b>vortex</b> <b>flowmeters</b> and self induced excitations of structures in general. The experiments were carried out in two separate blower tunnels under various oscillatory flow conditions in the Reynolds number range (0. 5 - 5. 0) X 104 and amplitudes of velocity fluctuation (+/-AU/U) of up to 0. 3. It was found that amplitudes of oscillations of the order of 0. 025 were sufficient to induce frequency lock-in when the reduced velocity was close to 1 / 2 S and, provided the amplitude was sufficiently large, limited synchronisation could also be induced near the upper and lower reduced velocities of 1 /S and 1 / 4 S. Synchronisation is accompanied by enhanced vortex shedding which, in turn, can lead to increased base suction (and therefore increase in drag force). Flow visualisation revealed that the near wake vortex arrangement can vary a great deal depending on the ratio of Strouhal numbers at the forced and self-excited frequencies (N/no). It was concluded that the behaviour of the base pressure reflected this situation and that the range of synchronisation depended strongly on the stability of the prevailing mode of vortex shedding. The precise details of the flow were found to be highly dependent on body geometry and the frequency ratio N/no. The production of oscillatory flow in the wind tunnels did not proved to be an easy task. A review of the various methods that have been used in the past is presented. The advantages and disadvantages of different techniques are highlighted and details are given of a further method developed for use with the present open circuit blower tunnels of differing sizes. In the smaller tunnel, having a working section size of 0. 3 x 0. 3 m, it was possible to produce sinusoidal variations of the working section flow, having peak to peak amplitude of up to 60 % of the mean flow speed and frequencies up to, typically, that corresponding to the acoustic quarter-wavelength frequency determined by the tunnel length. Over the viable working range, the device is shown to produce high quality periodic flow with negligible harmonic distortion or acoustic noise difficulties...|$|R

The installation and movement of equipment have been made without documentation and without considering that, changes in the distribution of potable water, can cause changes in the regime of operation of the pumping system. To document the installation and changes in the position of equipment, new drawings of the distribution of drinking water were made.

40|$|The {{use of a}} meter that {{displays}} instantaneously to {{the tractor}} operator on a continuous basis the fuel efficiency of his tillage operation, would make possible the observation {{of the change in}} efficiency and the effect on the tillage operation when changes in field condition occur. The operator would be able to make adjustments and immediately observe the effect on efficiency {{in order to keep the}} efficiency as high as possible. The selection of a best size machine and adjusting the speed and depth to improve fuel efficiency should not affect the quality of tillage. Trying to maintain the efficiency as high as possible means higher power output at a lower fuel consumption. Therefore, cheaper operation can be achieved. Fuel efficiency is the drawbar horsepower of the tractor (constant x load x speed) divided by the power input (amount of fuel consumed). In view of this, an efficiency meter was constructed and tested. The meter electrically calculated the efficiency from the outputs of three transducers measuring draft, speed and fuel consumption. An electrical resistance strain gage dynamometer, a d. c. tachometer generator and a turbine meter were used to determine the load pulled by the tractor, the actual speed of the tractor and fuel consumed by the tractor engine respectively. The linear characteristics between the variable being measured and the output of each of the three devices listed above have the advantage in making a fuel efficiency meter simpler to design. A low cost <b>vortex</b> <b>flowmeter</b> that can be used on Agricultural tractors for the measurements of fuel consumption was built and tested. The meter showed a linear measuring characteristic and that the frequency of rotation of the contained ball depends mainly on the density of the ball and track radius.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} flow {{measuring}} techniques applied on steady and pulsatingflows. Specifically, it {{is focused on}} gas flows where density changes canbe significant, i. e. compressible flows. In such flows only the mass flow ratehas a significance and not the volume flow rate since the latter depends onthe pressure. The motivation {{for the present study}} is found in the use of flowmeters for various purposes in the gas exchange system for internal combustionengines. Applications can be found for instance regarding measurements of airflow to the engine, or measurements of the amount of exhaust gas recirculation. However the scope of thesis is wider than this, since the thesis aims toinvestigate the response of flow meters to pulsating flows. The study is mainlyexperimental, but it also includes an introduction and discussion of several inindustry, common flow measuring techniques. The flow meters were studied using a newly developed flow rig, designedfor measurement of steady and pulsating air flow of mass flow rates and pulsefrequencies typically found in the gas exchange system of cars and smallertrucks. Flow rates are up to about 200 g/s and pulsation frequencies from 0 Hz(i. e. steady flow) up to 80 Hz. The study included the following flow meters:hot-film mass flow meter, venturi flowmeter, Pitot tube, <b>vortex</b> <b>flowmeter</b> andturbine flowmeter. The performance of these meters were evaluated at bothsteady and pulsating conditions. Furthermore, the flow under both steady andpulsating conditions were characterized by means of a resistance-wire basedmass flow meter, with the ability to perform time resolved measurements ofboth the mass flux ρu, and the stagnation temperature T 0. Experiments shows that, for certain flow meters, a quasi-steady assumptionis fairly well justified at pulsating flow conditions. This means that thefundamental equations describing the steady flow, for each instant of time,is applicable also in the pulsating flow. In the set-up, back-flow occurred atcertain pulse frequencies, which can result in highly inaccurate output fromcertain flow meters, depending on the measurement principle. For the purposeof finding means to determine when back flow prevails, LDV measurementswere also carried out. These measurements were compared with measurementsusing a vortex flow meter together with a new signal processing technique basedon wavelet analysis. The comparison showed that this technique may have apotential to measure pulsating flow rates accurately.
