Within thick cellulose samples, volatile compounds such as levoglucosan undergo ‘secondary reactions’ to <b>volatile</b> <b>products</b> including pyrans and light oxygenates such as glycolaldehyde.|$|E
50|$|Levoglucosan is 1,6-anhydro {{derivative}} of glucose. It {{is one of}} the key products in thermal conversion of polysaccharides.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that poly(butene- 1 sulfone) and poly(hexene- 1 sulfone), which are 1 : 1 {{alternating}} copolymers of the type +CH 2 CHR-SO 2 +n, undergo rapid degradation upon irradiation in the solid state in air and in vacuo. G(fracture) = 10. 7 for poly(butene- 1 sulfone) at 0 ° and 9. 8 for poly(hexene- 1 sulfone) at 30 °, both in vacuo. The values of G(fracture) were higher for irradiation in air. The main <b>volatile</b> <b>product</b> at 0 ° was sulfur dioxide, in comparable yield to G(fracture), suggesting specificity of C-S fracture and stabilization of main-chain fracture by SO 2 elimination. Increasing irradiation temperatures resulted in increasing depropagation to the two comonomers {{as a result of the}} thermodynamic instability of the polymer. Hydrogen was the other main <b>volatile</b> <b>product,</b> and there were very small amounts of saturated hydrocarbons.

40|$|The {{photodegradation}} at 157 nm of {{thin films}} {{of a series}} of Teflon AF copolymers has been comprehensively examined using electron spin resonance, NMR, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopies, mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The mechanism of degradation involves reaction at the dioxole units, and as a consequence the sensitivity to degradation increases across the series Teflon AF 1200, 1600, and 2400. A major <b>volatile</b> <b>product</b> is hexafluoroacetone formed by degradation at the dioxole unit. NMR and <b>volatile</b> <b>product</b> analysis confirm that degradation occurs largely at the dioxole unit leading to an array of new chain-end species. Main-chain and chain-end carbon-centered radicals were identified as arising from abstraction reactions and main-chain cleavage, respectively. In addition to loss of the dioxole units, XPS analysis indicates extensive char formation at the film surface, providing evidence of loss of fluorine atoms which in turn may react with free radical intermediates to form stable products identified by NMR. The implications for design of materials for 157 nm photolithography are discussed...|$|R

Using supervised and unsupervised methods of multivariate data analysis, we were able to quantitatively correlate <b>volatile</b> degradation <b>products</b> with properties important for the preservation of historic paper: rosin, lignin and carbonyl group content, degree of polymerization of cellulose, and paper acidity. On the basis of volatile degradic footprinting, we identified degradation markers for rosin and lignin in paper and investigated their effect on degradation.

50|$|Charcoal is {{obtained}} by heating wood until its complete pyrolysis (carbonization) occurs, leaving only carbon and inorganic ash. In {{many parts of}} the world charcoal is still produced semi-industrially by burning a pile of wood that has been mostly covered with mud or with bricks. The heat generated by burning part of the wood and the volatile byproducts pyrolyzes the rest of the pile. The limited supply of oxygen prevents the charcoal from burning.

5000|$|The term [...] "decarboxylation" [...] {{literally}} means {{removal of}} the COOH (carboxyl group) and its replacement with a hydrogen. The term relates {{the state of the}} reactant and product. Decarboxylation {{is one of the oldest}} organic reactions, since it often entails simple pyrolysis, and <b>volatile</b> <b>products</b> distilled from the reactor. Heating is required because the reaction is less favorable at low temperatures. Yields are highly sensitive to conditions. In retrosynthesis, decarboxylation reactions can be considered the opposite of homologation reactions, in that the chain length becomes one carbon shorter.

40|$|Aims To {{determine}} if bacterial species responsible for clinically relevant wound infection produce specific volatile profiles {{that would allow}} their speciation. Methods and Results Selected-Ion Flow Tube-Mass Spectrometry in full mass scan mode was used to analyse headspace gases produced by wound-associated bacteria grown in vitro, so as to enable identification of bacterial <b>volatile</b> <b>product</b> ion profiles in the resulting mass spectra. Applying multivariate statistical analysis (hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis) to the resultant mass spectra enabled clear speciation. Moreover, bacterial <b>volatile</b> <b>product</b> ions could be detected from artificially contaminated wound dressing material, although the pattern of product ions detected was influenced by culture conditions. Conclusions Using selected product ions from the SIFT-MS mass spectra {{it is possible to}} discriminate wound-associated bacterial species grown under specific in vitro culture conditions. Significance and Impact of Study The results of this study have shown that wound associated bacteria can be discriminated using volatile analysis in vitro and that bacterial volatiles can be detected from wound dressing material.

5000|$|Cleanability - the {{difficulty}} of removal of flux and its residues after the soldering operation. Fluxes with higher content of solids tend to leave larger amount of residues; thermal decomposition of some vehicles also leads to formation of difficult-to-clean, polymerized and possibly even charred deposits (a problem especially for hand soldering). Some flux residues are soluble in organic solvents, others in water, some in both. Some fluxes are no-clean, as they are sufficiently volatile or undergoing thermal decomposition to <b>volatile</b> <b>products</b> {{that they do not}} require the cleaning step. Other fluxes leave non-corrosive residues that can be left in place. However, flux residues can interfere with subsequent operations; they can impair adhesion of conformal coatings, or act as undesired insulation on connectors and contact pads for test equipment.|$|E
50|$|LTTD {{has proven}} very {{effective}} in reducing concentrations of petroleum products including gasoline, jet fuels, kerosene, diesel fuel, heating oils, and lubricating oils. LTTD is applicable to constituents that are volatile at temperatures up to 1,200 °F. Most desorbers operate at temperatures between 300 °F to 1,000 °F. Desorbers constructed of special alloys can operate at temperatures up to 1,200 °F. More <b>volatile</b> <b>products</b> (e.g. gasoline) can be desorbed at the lower operating range, while semivolatile products (e.g. kerosene, diesel fuel) generally need temperatures over 700 °F, and relatively nonvolatile products (e.g., heating oil, lubricating oils) need even higher temperatures. Essentially all soil types are amenable for treatment by LTTD systems. However, different soils may require varying degrees and types of pretreatment. For example, coarse-grained soils (e.g. gravel and cobbles) may require crushing; fine-grained soils that are excessively cohesive (e.g. clay) may require shredding.|$|E
5000|$|Injunctions both {{preliminary}} {{and permanent}} could and were often issued {{in cases involving}} gas works. For example, the ill reputation of gas-works became so well known that in City of Cleveland vs. Citizens' Gas Light Co., 20 N. J.

The injunction not only regulated the gas manufacturing process - forbidding the use of lime purification - but also provided that if nuisances of any sort were to issue from the works - a permanent injunction forbidding the production of gas would issue from the court. Indeed, as the Master of the Rolls, Lord Langdale, once remarked in his opinion in Haines v. Taylor, 10 Beavan 80, that I have been rather astonished to hear the effects of gas works treated as nothing...every man, in these days, must have sufficient experience, to enable him to come to the conclusion, that, whether a nuisance or not, a gas manufactory is a very disagreeable thing.
