To apply for a check a VIC1 form had to be completed and submitted to VOSA. A car bought with no V5C might also require a VIC, even if there had been no insurance claim, to confirm its identify before a new V5C was issued.|$|E

The bank which handles a person's vehicle account will pay road taxes, insurance premiums on behalf of the vehicle account holder from his/her money savings account. The traffic police department will suffice to oversee all vehicles in promptly paying the road taxes and insurance premiums regularly. The data on payment of road taxes collected from banks will ensure that the checking authorities can stop only the non tax- paying vehicles leaving the tax paid vehicles unstopped on the highways...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work {{deals with}} the {{creation}} of a real-life android application, where all the necessary details of a <b>vehicle</b> (i. e., <b>Registration</b> <b>Certificate,</b> Insurance Policy and vehicle's Pollution Under Control Certificate) are coordinated and stored by the user without much effort. Quick Response Code (QR-Code), a highly effective and fast readable technology is used for scanning various details of a vehicle. Similarly a parallel application for the inspecting authority of a vehicle is also created to verify the credentials of the vehicle. The inspecting authority needs to scan a unique QR-Code (which is provided separately for every vehicle) into the mobile application. The simple UI(User Interface) provided in the application allows the faster recognition of the availability, or the lack of availability, of the important documents pertaining to that particular vehicle. These applications help in saving significant amount of time and resources which are at present spent on this task. In view of the security risks of exposing personal details of users, greater care has also been given for securing the data by using QR-Codes and securing access to those details...|$|R

Along with the certificate, the agency also issues <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> number plates. The registration lasts generally for a maximum of a year, after which time the <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> must be renewed. The <b>registration</b> <b>certificate</b> notes the model, make, year, shape, VIN Chasis number and Engine number, weights, engine capacity and number of passengers.
