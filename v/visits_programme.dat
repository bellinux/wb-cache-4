Governor General Adrienne Clarkson twice visited, selecting Saskatoon for her urban <b>visits</b> <b>programme</b> through which she sought to dialogue with urban citizens [...] "about innovations {{and ideas that}} can be shared with other municipalities to make cities desirable places to live". On this visit, Clarkson hosted a youth roundtable, literary forum and awards presentation, and also met with aboriginal elders. A visit by Roméo LeBlanc included a hospital, senior citizens centre and aboriginal heritage park, another by the Duke of Devonshire included a primary school, and another by the Duke of Connaught included a riverfront cathedral. Former Saskatonian and Governor General Ramon Hnatyshyn was schooled at local grade schools and at the University of Saskatchewan. He is credited with popularising his office on re-opening the vice-regal residence to the public, encouraging artistic development, supporting education and strengthening multiculturalism. Governor General the Earl of Minto visited in 1901, the year Saskatoon was incorporated as a village, and each of his successors have since visited. Their visits include that of Earl Grey in 1906, the Duke and Duchess of Connaught and Princess Patricia in 1912, the Duke of Devonshire in 1917, with the Duchess of Devonshire in 1918, 1919 and 1921, Lord and Lady Byng in 1922 and 1926, the Viscount and Lady Willingdon in 1929, the Earl and Countess of Bessborough in 1932 and 1935, Lord Tweedsmuir in 1938, the Earl of Athlone and Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone in 1941, the Viscount and Lady Alexander in 1946 and 1948, Vincent Massey in 1952 and 1957, Georges and Madame Vanier in 1960 and 1965, Roland Michener in 1968, Jules Léger in 1975, Edward and Mrs. Schreyer in 1979 and 1982, Jeanne Sauvé in 1984, Ramon and Mrs. Hnatyshyn in 1990, Roméo and Mrs. Leblanc in 1995 and Adrienne Clarkson in 2000 and 2004.

Teachers from two schools undertook a series of visits with the aim of developing learning and teaching in their schools. The pilot sought to understand ways in which such a collaborative <b>visits</b> <b>programme</b> could be used to build professional knowledge across school boundaries. It suggests that such knowledge- building is the precursor to a change of practice. An investigation of the literature reveals potential issues in making tacit knowledge visible and in recording teachers??? learning so that it can contribute to a developing professional knowledge base. The paper discusses how these issues manifested themselves in practice and offers a framework for professional learning visits which underlines the continuous nature of professional learning, the need for reflection to decode what has been learned and the need for active and continuing participation by host and visitor in order to effect a change in practice. It concludes by considering the challenges of a full <b>visits???</b> <b>programme</b> and how such a programme may be used to strengthen teachers??? capacity for innovation...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{proved a}} unique opportunity to observe a cohort of 20 life-sentenced prisoners that had already negotiated an often fragmented and difficult ‘system’. These prisoners were at the Category-C stage of their sentence (medium security) and looking to progress to Category-D (open conditions) and ultimately towards release on license. Unusually, they were attempting to do this at a private prison, HMP Wolds in East Yorkshire - the first private prison to open in Europe in 1992. Due to negotiating a new contract in 2001, it became the first private prison house a group of ‘lifers’ in a dedicated Lifer Unit. The research details how progress was made and how this private prison, staffed with predominantly untrained specialised ‘lifer’ supervisors, coped with this type of prisoner and if the prisoners would progress on time. This qualitative research project examines issues such as conditions, staffing, education, work and programmes, mainly {{through the eyes of the}} prisoners but also by way of staff interviews and observation. Although no direct comparison could be made with a similar private prison, as no other private prison held lifers at that time, it is a useful observational study with a degree of longitudinal depth. The prison certainly demonstrated that it could hold lifers in very good conditions, overseen by excellent quality staff and three quarters of the cohort had either progressed on time or were scheduled to progress to open conditions at the time the research concluded. From the Director personally, the staff made every effort to do things correctly, not only providing the minimum requirements, but providing pockets of innovation that could lead to universal improvements in the treatment of prisoners in England and Wales – most notably the decent manner in which prisoners were treated by staff, which leads to a much more relaxed atmosphere, and therefore a quieter prison with few disciplinary issues. Cognitive-behavioural programmes were analysed and the research demonstrated that the whole rehabilitative idea, although well conceived, is poorly administered in practice, with no central coordination. The research questions whether lifers are suited to such programmes and whether they should actually take up much sought-after places on such courses considering their potential distance from release. To bring this narrative account to life, the thesis highlights two prisoners and conducts a detailed ‘case study’ of each; one who negotiated the ‘system’ successfully and another who failed to engage. It follows their time at HMP Wolds and explores their experiences of the prison regime generally, conditions and staff and considers such issues as sentence planning, town <b>visits,</b> <b>programme</b> provision and delivery. These two prisoners commented lucidly on their time in HMP Wolds and although they were generally very positive about their experience, these comparative case studies demonstrate the difficulty in negotiating the prison ‘system’. The standard of treatment in HMP Wolds was found to be high, backed up with external inspection reports, with most lifers making progress on time due to excellent staff diligence. The privatisation debate, morally and practically, is discussed at length and the holding of lifers sees an increase in not only numbers, but responsibility in the private sector. It could be argued that following almost two years studying this private prison; that if private establishments prove to be no worse that the public sector and no more expensive, then surely this is all that can be asked of them. There is concern as to whether the currently over-crowded prison system is working, but private prisons have certainly not added to the problem, indeed privatisation may have improved some aspects and therefore relatively, privatisation can and should be labelled a success.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{quantify}} {{the effectiveness of}} home <b>visiting</b> <b>programmes</b> {{in the prevention of}} child injury and child abuse. DESIGN [...] Systematic review of 11 randomised controlled trials of home <b>visiting</b> <b>programmes.</b> Pooled odds ratios were estimated as an inverse variance weighted average of the study specific odds ratios. SETTING [...] Randomised trials that were available by April 1995. SUBJECTS [...] The trials comprised 3433 participants. RESULTS [...] Eight trials examined the effectiveness of home visiting in the prevention of childhood injury. The pooled odds ratio for the eight trials was 0. 74 (95 % confidence interval 0. 60 to 0. 92). Four studies examined the effect of home visiting on injury {{in the first year of}} life. The pooled odds ratio was 0. 98 (0. 62 to 1. 53). Nine trials examined the effect of home visiting on the occurrence of suspected abuse, reported abuse, or out of home placement for child abuse. Because of the potential for bias in outcome reporting in these studies, pooled effect estimates were not calculated. CONCLUSIONS [...] Home <b>visiting</b> <b>programmes</b> have the potential to reduce significantly the rates of childhood injury. The problem of differential surveillance for child abuse between intervention and control groups precludes the use of reported abuse as a valid outcome measure in controlled trials of home visiting...|$|R

40|$|AIMS—To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of home <b>visiting</b> <b>programmes</b> on parenting and quality of the home environment.  DESIGN—Systematic review of the literature of randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies evaluating home <b>visiting</b> <b>programmes</b> involving at least one postnatal visit.  SUBJECTS—Thirty four studies reported relevant outcomes; 26 used participants considered to be at risk of adverse maternal or child health outcomes; two used preterm or low birth weight infants; and two used infants with failure to thrive. Only eight used participants not considered to be at risk of adverse child health outcomes.  RESULTS—Seventeen studies reported Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) scores, 27 reported other measures of parenting, and 10 reported both types of outcome. Twelve studies were entered into the meta analysis. This showed a significant effect of home visiting on HOME score. Similar results were found after restricting the analyses to randomised controlled trials and to higher quality studies. Twenty one of the 27 studies reporting other measures of parenting found significant treatment effects favouring the home visited group on a range of measures.  CONCLUSIONS—Home <b>visiting</b> <b>programmes</b> were associated with an improvement in the quality of the home environment. Few studies used UK health visitors, so caution must be exercised in extrapolating the results to current UK health visiting practice. Further work is needed to evaluate whether UK health visitors can achieve similar results. Comparisons with similar programmes delivered by paraprofessionals or community mothers are also needed. ...|$|R

Early intervention and addressing {{the underlying causes}} behind {{child abuse and neglect}} (poverty, social isolation, being a young parent, drug and alcohol abuse, living in restricted circumstances i. e. on the benefit) has been proven to work when services are implemented correctly. Examples of successful early intervention strategies are the home <b>visiting</b> <b>programmes,</b> Early Start and Family Help Trust; however they are only available to a limited number of families in Christchurch. The countrywide home <b>visiting</b> <b>programme,</b> Family Start, is criticised for not producing enough positive outcomes and this has resulted in five Family Start sites closed down and their contracts retendered. These programmes are based off American models which strong research shows do not only reduce child abuse and neglect, but also improves a range of desired results such as increasing education and employment and reducing crime. Later this year the Government will release a 10 year action plan for vulnerable children. Child well-being advocates sincerely hope that early intervention and addressing the underlying causes will feature heavily and produce the much needed policy changes to reduce child abuse and neglect. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: to {{investigate}} {{the impact of a}} long-term nurse home <b>visiting</b> <b>programme,</b> embedded within a universal child health system, on the health, development and well-being of the child, mother and family. Design Randomised controlled trial. Setting/participants: 208 (111 intervention, 97 comparison) eligible at-risk mothers living in a socioeconomically disadvantaged area in Sydney, booking into the local public hospital for confinement. Intervention: a sustained and structured nurse home visiting antenatal and postnatal parenting education and support programme. Control: usual universal care. Main outcome measures: the quality of the home environment for child development (12 – 24 months), parent–child interaction and child mental, psychomotor and behavioural development at 18 months. Results: mothers receiving the intervention were more emotionally and verbally responsive (HOME observation) during the first 2 years of their child's life than comparison group mothers (mean difference 0. 5; 95 % CI 0. 1 to 0. 9). Duration of breastfeeding was longer for intervention mothers than comparison mothers (mean difference 7. 9 weeks; 95 % CI 2. 9 to 12. 9). There {{was no significant difference in}} parent–child interaction between the intervention and comparison groups. There were no significant overall group differences in child mental, psychomotor or behavioural development.
