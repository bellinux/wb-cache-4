40|$|Environmental sensor {{networks}} (ESNs) {{provide new}} opportunities for improving {{our understanding of the}} environment. In contrast to remote sensing technologies where measurements are made from large distances (e. g. satellite imagery, aerial photography, airborne radiometric surveys), ESNs focus on measurements that are made in close proximity to the target environmental phenomenon. Sensors can be used to collect a much larger number of measurements, which are quantitative and repeatable. They can also be deployed in locations that may otherwise be difficult to visit regularly. Sensors that are commonly used in the environmental sciences include ground-based multispectral <b>vegetation</b> <b>sensors,</b> soil moisture sensors, GPS tracking and bioacoustics for tracking movement in wild and domesticated animals. Sensors may also be coupled with wireless networks to more effectively capture, synthesise and transmit data to decision-makers. The climate and weather monitoring domains provide useful examples of how ESNs can provide real-time monitoring of environmental change (e. g. temperature, rainfall, sea-surface temperature) to many users. The objective of this review is to examine state-of-the-art use of ESNs for three environmental monitoring domains: (a) terrestrial vegetation, (b) animal movement and diversity, and (c) soil.

A new algorithm for fluorescence retrieval from spectral bands measurement is described.

After {{a brief description of}} the <b>VEGETATION</b> <b>sensors,</b> radiometric calibration process, based on vicarious desertic targets is first presented. The cloud screening algorithm was then fine tuned using a global network of cloudiness observations. Atmospheric correction is then achieved using the SMAC code with inputs coming from meteorological values of pressure, ozone and water vapour. Aerosol optical thickness is derived from MODIS climatology assuming continental aerosol type. The Roujean BRDF model is then adjusted for red, near infrared and short wave infrared bands used to the remaining cloud free observations collected over a time window of ± 15 days. Outliers due to possible cloud contamination or residual atmospheric correction are iteratively eliminated and prior information is used to get more robust estimates of the three BRDF kernel coefficients. Nadir viewing top of canopy reflectance in the three bands is input to the biophysical algorithm to compute the products at 10 days sampling interval.

Details on the way the training data base was generated and the neural network designed and calibrated are presented. Finally, theoretical performances are discussed.

40|$|International audienceLaunched in March 1998 on the SPOT- 4 platform, the <b>VEGETATION</b> <b>sensor</b> (VGT) {{has been}} {{designed}} {{for the analysis of}} vegetation dynamics. It provides daily images with 1 km spatial resolution. Because of this daily sampling, it can be used for agricultural monitoring, with applications such as yield estimation and forecast, and detection of growth anomalies. These studies can furthermore be performed on large areas due to the large size of VGT scenes. The 1 km spatial resolution, however, can be a problem when studying European agricultural areas: since agricultural parcels are usually relatively small, most VGT pixels contain several different land cover types and it is therefore necessary to perform pixel unmixing. For that purpose, the simultaneous use of SPOT-XS and VGT makes it possible to estimate daily reflectances of individual land coverages at the parcel level: SPOTXS is used to provide spatial information, i. e. the location of parcels, while VGT provides temporal information at a coarse spatial scale. The estimation of agricultural parameters for large areas is achieved through operational scenarios, which depend on the amount of data available. In this chapter, we detail one scenario, making use of one SPOT image and a VGT sequence to obtain land use at high spatial resolution together with its temporal behaviour...|$|E

Thus, any change, whether, natural (e. g. growth, fire, death) or due to anthropogenic activity (e. g. logging, burning, urbanization) may {{have a significant impact}} on the Earth's carbon cycle. Through the use of Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) and NASA's Laser <b>Vegetation</b> Imaging <b>Sensor</b> (LVIS), which are airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) remote sensing technologies, we gather data to estimate the amount of carbon contained in forests and how the content changes over time. UAVSAR and LVIS sensors were sent all over the world with the objective of mapping out terrain to gather tree canopy height and biomass data; This data is in turn used to correlate vegetation with the global carbon cycle around the world...|$|R
40|$|Foliage {{profiles}} retrieved froma scanning, terrestrial, near-infrared (1064 nm), full-waveformlidar, the Echidna Validation Instrument (EVI), agree {{well with}} those obtained from an airborne, near-infrared, full-waveform, large footprint lidar, the Lidar <b>Vegetation</b> Imaging <b>Sensor</b> (LVIS). We conducted trials at 5 plots within a conifer stand at Sierra National Forest in August, 2008. Foliage profiles retrieved {{from these two}} lidar systems are closely correlated (e. g., r = 0. 987 at 100 mhorizontal distances) at large spatial coverage while they differ significantly at small spatial coverage, indicating the apparent scanning perspective effect on foliage profile retrievals. Alsowe noted the obvious effects of local topography on foliage profile retrievals, particularly on the topmost height retrievals. With a fine spatial resolution and a small beam size, terrestrial lidar systems complement {{the strengths of the}} airborne lidars by making a detailed characterization of the crowns from a small field site, and thereby serving as a validation tool and providing localized tuning information for future airborne and spaceborne lidar missions...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work is to assess the {{potential}} of multitemporal images from the 1 -km SPOT- 4 <b>VEGETATION</b> (VGT) <b>sensor</b> to obtain a land cover map of the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) for the year 2000, discriminating primary tropical forest, cerrado savanna, agriculture/pasture, natural/artificial waterbodies, and secondary succession forest, using a probability-bagging classification tree (PBCT). The 10 -fold cross validation procedure yielded an overall sample accuracy of 0. 92. Besides, this algorithm allowed us to build a class membership probability map, with ~ 80 % of the pixels with class membership probability greater or equal than 0. 8. The estimated total area of agriculture/pasture and secondary succession forest in the BLA was 877, 435 km 2 and 57, 636 km 2, respectively. Comparison with an existing land cover map indicates that agriculture/pasture occurred primarily in areas previously occupied by primary tropical forest (45. 8 %) and cerrado savanna (32. 7 %).
