40|$|This work {{presents}} a new iterative method for optimally selecting a <b>vertical</b> <b>retrieval</b> grid {{based on the}} location of the information while accounting for inter-level correlations. Sample atmospheres initially created to parametrise the Radiative Transfer Model for the Television Infrared Observation Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder (RTTOV) forward model are used to compare the presented iterative selection method with two other common approaches, which are using levels of equal vertical spacing and selecting levels based on the cumulative trace of the averaging kernel matrix (AKM). This new method is shown to outperform compared methods for simulated profile retrievals of temperature, H 2 O, O 3, CH 4, and CO with the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). However, the benefits of using the more complicated iterative approach compared to the simpler cumulative trace method are slight and may not justify the added effort for the cases studied, but may be useful in other scenarios where temperature and trace gases have strong vertical gradients with significant estimate sensitivity. Furthermore, comparing retrievals using a globally optimised static grid vs. a locally adapted one shows that a static grid performs nearly as well for retrievals of O 3, CH 4, and CO. However, developers of temperature and H 2 O retrieval schemes may at least consider using adaptive or location specific <b>vertical</b> <b>retrieval</b> grids...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Limb {{sounders}} measure {{atmospheric radiation}} that {{is dependent on}} a radial and angular distribution of temperature and atmospheric constituents. Based on this dependency, we perform and characterize both two dimensional (radial and angular) and one dimensional (vertical) limb profile retrievals of a distribution of carbon monoxide (CO), which represents a simulated plume {{off the coast of}} south-east Asia. Both the one dimensional (1 -D) and two dimensional (2 -D) limb retrievals are characterized by evaluating their averaging kernels and error covariances on a radial and angular grid that spans the plume. This 2 -D characterization allows the radial and angular resolution as well as the degrees of freedom and information content to be computed for these limb retrievals. We apply this 2 -D characterization of a limb retrieval to a comparison of the 2 -D retrieval with the 1 -D (<b>vertical)</b> <b>retrieval.</b> We find the information content for the 2 -D retrieval is an order of magnitude larger than that of the 1 -D retrieval and the degrees of freedom is about a factor of two larger. We also use the 2 -D averaging kernel to develop a strategy for validation of a limb retrieval with an in-situ measurement...|$|E
40|$|Introduction In the {{presence}} of broken clouds over snow or ice covered surfaces {{it is difficult for}} UV/VIS spaceborne sensors to distinguish between clouds and high reflecting surfaces.

40|$|Trace gases {{comprise}} {{less than}} 1 % of Earthâs atmosphere, yet they dominate the radiation budget and drive atmospheric chemistry. The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) {{is a set}} of two nadir viewing Fourier transform spectrometers aboard the MetOp-A and B satellites in polar orbit that measure spectral radiances in the thermal infrared and, therefore, observe the spectroscopic signatures of numerous trace gases. This thesis focuses on the practicalities of fully utilizing the vast amounts of data recorded via satellite with limited computational resources and prior knowledge of the target gas. First, a method for selecting a <b>vertical</b> <b>retrieval</b> grid is presented that minimizes the amount of prior knowledge appearing in the estimate due to applied constraints. This selection method uses the information content of the retrieval to optimally determine the number and spacings of vertical levels, while accounting for correlations between the various layers. Failing to select an appropriate vertical grid for water vapour and temperature retrievals, such as using levels equally spaced in pressure, was found to reduce the information content by as much as 30 % on average. Overwhelmingly, the slowest part of an iterative retrieval is evaluating the forward model. As a result, the computation may fail to keep pace with data acquisition. Procedures to parametrise the Reference Forward Model (RFM) by creating a set of pre-tabulated look-up tables (LUTs) of absorption cross-sections for individual gases were developed. Since such LUTs can be unruly in size, a simple compression scheme based on linear interpolation was analysed that reduced the total LUT size to just 4. 4 % of the original. Additionally, the fine spectral grid for radiative transfer was also reduced using similar methods. Model comparisons to a global atmospheric ensemble showed negligible increases in error compared to IASI instrument noise and a factor of 130 increase in computational speed. These LUTs are openly available for use by the scientific community, whether using the RFM or to be incorporated into any forward model. Finally, a linear retrieval scheme was developed to estimate total column amounts of carbonyl sulphide (OCS) at a rate roughly 10 4 times faster than a typical iterative retrieval. This scheme incorporates two concepts not utilised in previously published linear estimates. First, all physical parameters affecting the signal are included in the state vector and accounted for jointly, rather than treated as effective noise. Second, the initialisation point is determined from an ensemble of atmospheres based on comparing the model spectra to the observations, thus improving the linearity of the problem. The entirety of IASI data from 2014 was analysed and showed spatial features of OCS total columns including depletions over tropical rainforests, seasonal enhancements over the oceans, and distinct OCS features over land. Error due to assuming linearity was found to be on the order of 11 % globally for OCS. Comparisons to surface VMR in situ samples taken by NOAA show seasonal correlations greater than 0. 7 for five out of seven sites across the globe. Furthermore, this linear scheme was applied to OCS, but may also be used as a rapid estimator of any detectable trace gas using IASI or similar nadir-viewing instruments. </p...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges to dual-Doppler <b>retrieval</b> of the <b>vertical</b> wind is the lack of low-level divergence information available to the mass conservation constraint. This study examines the impact of a vertical vorticity equation constraint on <b>vertical</b> velocity <b>retrievals</b> when radar observations are lacking near the ground. The analysis proceeds in a three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3 DVAR) framework with the anelastic form of the vertical vorticity equation imposed along with traditional data, mass conservation, and smoothness constraints.

Some comparisons are made with an alternative, less flexible model based on the Integral Equation Model (IEM) theory, and partial comparisons are also made with experimental data, which authorize to consider the proposed model well grounded and exploitable for application.

In this thesis, a unique, fast radiative transfer model for UV-vis-NIR limb radiances has been developed, implemented, and validated.

The weighting functions for all parameters are calculated from analytical formulae. A realistic instrument model with field-of-view integration and signal-to-noise computation and retrieval algorithms have also been implemented. All have been combined in the new program package SCIARAYS. The package has been applied for the characterisation of the limb measurements in several ways:The simulated weighting functions agree well with those due to full multiple scattering. Thus they may be used to calculate theoretical precision estimates and averaging kernels. In conformance with this, test retrievals with approximate weighting functions converge correctly. Therefore, the approximate weighting functions of SCIARAYS are well suited for retrievals from SCIAMACHY´s limb measurements. Detailed theoretical retrieval precisions have been calculated for SCIAMACHY´s trace gas targets.

The GPSRO data are validated and compared with analysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts using a series of criteria designed to eliminate faulty soundings but retain profiles which do not differ too strongly from the model data.

Two facets of overlap are investigated: cloud fraction overlap, {{expressed in terms of}} a parameter " α " indicating the relative contributions of maximum and random overlap, and overlap of horizontal distributions of condensate, expressed in terms of the correlation coefficient of condensate ranks. The degree of proximity to the random and maximum overlap assumptions is also expressed in terms of a decorrelation length, a convenient scalar parameter for overlap parameters assumed to decay exponentially with separation distance. Both cloud fraction overlap and condensate overlap show significant seasonal variations with a clear tendency for more maximum overlap in the summer months. More maximum overlap is also generally observed when the domain size used to define cloud fractions increases. These tendencies also exist for rank correlations, but are significantly weaker. Hitherto unexplored overlap parameter dependencies are investigated by analyzing mean parameter differences at fixed separation distance within different layers of the atmospheric column, and by searching for possible systematic relationships between alpha and rank correlation. We find that for the same separation distance the overlap parameters are significantly distinct in different atmospheric layers, and that random cloud fraction overlap is usually associated with more randomly overlapped condensate ranks...|$|R

As an alternative, satellite derived atmospheric soundings provide continuous spatial coverage at regular intervals irrespective of geographical location. With the recent installation of a remote sensing station at the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology for L-band polar orbiting satellites, comparison studies between radiosonde and satellite derived atmospheric soundings have been initiated.

The comparison focuses on the period from December 1999 to February 2000, which was chosen due to large discrepancies in satellite infrared and passive microwave rainfall retrievals. Storm systems over the east Pacific exhibit a number of significant differences from those over the west Pacific warm pool including shallower clouds with warmer cloud tops, a larger proportion of stratiform rain, less ice for similar amounts of rainwater, and a radar bright band or melting layer significantly farther below the freezing level. These regional differences in the structure of precipitation systems between the east and west Pacific also exhibit seasonal and interannual variability. During the intense 1997 / 98 El Niño, warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the east Pacific led to precipitation systems with a very similar structure to those observed over the west. These differences in east versus west Pacific rainfall and changes associated with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) result in time-dependent regional biases in available long-term satellite precipitation datasets. Although all of the currently available infrared and passive microwave–based satellite retrievals exhibit similar spatial patterns and capture variability associated with ENSO, both the amplitude and sign of subtle climate signals, such as the response of tropical-mean rainfall to ENSO, depend on the retrieval algorithm used. 1...|$|R

This study presents first steps undertaken to reach this ambitious goal, focusing on the retrieval algorithm...|$|R

Scenes affected by biomass burning are removed {{on a daily basis}} using fire count observations, and we use the local model sensitivity to identify locations where the impact of spatial smearing is small, though this comprises spatial coverage over the region. We find that the use of the HCHO column data more tightly constrains the ensemble isoprene emission range from 27 - 61 TgC to 31 - 38 TgC for SCIAMACHY, and 45 - 104 TgC to 28 - 38 TgC for OMI. Median uncertainties of the top-down emissions are about 60 - 260 % for SCIAMACHY, and 10 - 90 % for OMI. We find that the inferred emissions are most sensitive to uncertainties in cloud fraction and cloud top pressure (differences of +/- 10 %), the a priori isoprene emissions (+/- 20 %), and the HCHO <b>vertical</b> column <b>retrieval</b> (+/- 30 %). Construction of continuous top-down emission maps generally improves GEOS-Chem's simulation of HCHO columns over the region, with respect to both the SCIAMACHY and OMI data. However, if local time top-down emissions are scaled to monthly mean values, the annual emission inferred from SCIAMACHY are nearly twice those from OMI. This difference cannot be explained by the different sampling of the sensors or uncertainties in the AMF calculation...|$|R

DOAS analysis using a 425 – 450 nm fitting window revealed a clear land–ocean contrast in NO 2 differential slant column densities (DSCDs) but poor fitting results and negative values, especially at low elevation angles at low latitudes (<~ 20 ° N). The poor fitting resulted in sparse NO 2 volume mixing ratio (VMR) {{data for the}} 0 – 1 km layer after applying our <b>vertical</b> profile <b>retrieval</b> method. In contrast, NO 2 VMRs retrieved using fitting results from 460 – 490 nm are positive even at low latitudes, while they are reasonably similar to those obtained from 425 – 450 nm at mid-latitudes. Because NO 2 DSCD for 425 – 450 nm shows a negative correlation with water vapor (H 2 O) DSCD, the poor fitting appears to be due primarily to interference by H 2 O. We analyzed a 338 – 370 nm fitting window, which is free from H 2 O, and found good agreement between NO 2 VMRs retrieved from 460 – 490 nm and 338 – 370 nm, even at low latitudes, at NO 2 VMRs higher than ~ 0. 2 ppbv. The {{results indicate that the}} background value of NO 2 VMR over the western Pacific and Indian Ocean during the cruises was less than ~ 0. 2 ppbv, with occasional enhancement to levels of ~ 0. 2 – 0. 4 ppbv...|$|R
40|$|Nadir {{infrared}} (IR) sounding {{can be used}} {{to derive}} information on trace gases relevant for climate and air quality. For <b>vertical</b> column density <b>retrievals</b> using SCIAMACHY near IR nadir observations, the BIRRA (Beer InfraRed Retrieval Algorithm) code has recently been implemented in the operational level 1 – 2 processor. For analysis of thermal IR nadir observations of AIRS, GOSAT, IASI, or TES, a closely related code CERVISA (Column EstimatoR Vertical Infrared Sounding of the Atmosphere) has been developed. Both codes share a large portion of modules, e. g., for line-by-line absorption and the nonlinear least squares solver. The essential difference is the part of the forward model devoted to radiative transfer through the atmosphere, i. e., Beer’s law for the near IR versus Schwarzschild’s equation for the thermal IR. For the ongoing validation of the BIRRA carbon monoxide CO and methane CH 4 products intercomparisons with thermal IR sounding data are performed. CERVISA retrieval results are compared both to the operational products of the IR sounder considered and to SCIAMACHY products retrieved with BIRRA...|$|R
40|$|CO inverse {{modelling}} {{studies have}} so far reported significant discrepancies between model concentrations optimised with the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite retrievals and surface in-situ measurements. Here, we assess how well a global CTM fits a large variety of independent CO observations (surface and aircraft air sample measurements and ground-based column retrievals) before and after assimilating MOPITTv 6 total column (X CO) retrievals to optimise CO sources/sinks. Consistent negative prior biases to all types of observations in all sensitivity tests suggest an underestimation of current surface emissions in the Northern hemisphere. In contrast, prior simulations fit the surface air sample observations well in the Southern hemisphere but underestimate CO in the free troposphere and on average in the column. Positive biases in MOPITT retrievals are identified in the Northern mid- and high latitudes, highlighting the importance of proper bias-correction of those satellite retrievals. Biases in representing vertical CO profiles are found over the ocean and most significantly in the Southern hemisphere, suggesting errors in the vertical distribution of CO chemical sources/sinks or in the vertical mixing to be improved in future modelling studies. Varying model-data differences {{are found in the}} vertical between CTM and MOPITT retrieved vertical profiles after having assimilated MOPITT X CO; these bias structures indicate that the posterior model differences to in-situ observations would be even larger if the near surface retrievals were assimilated instead of X CO. In addition, given the higher long-term stability of the MOPITT X CO retrievals as opposed to divergent temporal bias drifts found in the <b>vertical</b> profile <b>retrievals</b> and a lower sensitivity to model errors in the total column quantity than at a certain altitude, we recommend assimilating the column rather than the profiles or the partial profiles at the current stage...|$|R

Cloud microphysical properties derived from four different retrieval algorithms (two radar-lidar and two radar only algorithms) are compared by examining mean profiles and probability density functions of effective radius (Re), ice water content (IWC), visible extinction coefficient, ice number concentration, ice crystal fall speed, and <b>vertical</b> air velocity. <b>Retrieval</b> algorithm uncertainty is quantified using radiative flux closure exercises. The effect of uncertainty in retrieved quantities on the cloud radiative effect and radiative heating rates are presented. Our analysis shows that IWC compares well among algorithms, but Re shows significant discrepancies, which is attributed primarily to assumptions of particle shape. Uncertainty in Re and IWC translates into sometimes-large differences in cloud shortwave radiative effect (CRE) though {{the majority of cases}} have a CRE difference of roughly 10 [*]W[*]m- 2 on average. These differences, which we believe are primarily driven by the uncertainty in Re, can cause up to 2 [*]K/day difference in the radiative heating rates between algorithms...|$|R

The mixing ratio of ozone is sensitive to variations of its environment introduced by waves due to its short chemical lifetime. Ground-based millimetre-wave remote sensing of the 249. 6 ozone line deep within the Antarctic vortex at Troll station (72 °S, 2 °E) {{have been used to}} <b>retrieval</b> <b>vertical</b> ozone mixing ratio profiles below 100 km by the use of the optimal estimation method. Calculations cover data from December 2008 until November 2009 with a spectra resolution of 1 hour and an altitude resolution of 8 km. Fluctuations of the ozone mixing ratio where separated from seasonal variations. Spectral analysis were done by Lomb-Scargle analysis and a Morlet wavelet transform for altitudes between 35 and 75 km. Wave activity consistent with models and other measurements of planetary waves was found. Periodic bands of 1. 7 - 4, 4 - 8 and 8 - 16 days were extracted and could basically be related to the quasi two-day wave and the first three normal planetary modes. In addition consistence to wave activity extracted from meteor radar wind measurements at Senae could be shown. </p...|$|R
40|$|Every year a {{large amount}} of dust is transported over the north Atlantic ocean from North Africa into the Caribbean region. Despite the {{progress}} made during the last decades in the understanding and modeling of this process, many uncertainties still remain. In this cumulative thesis, the airborne Doppler wind lidar (DWL) measurements performed during the SALTRACE campaign (June-July 2013), large eddy simulations and the global atmospheric composition model MACC are used to study different aspects of the dust transport process and evaluate the current modeling capabilities. As part of this work, a novel calibration algorithm for the retrieval of quantitative aerosol backscatter and extinction coefficients from the DWL measurements is introduced. This calibration procedure relies on the simultaneous measurement of the same atmospheric volume by the airborne DWL and an aerosol ground-based lidar. This method is then validated with satellite lidar CALIOP and ground-based lidar measurements. Additionally, improvements in <b>vertical</b> wind <b>retrieval</b> algorithms are discussed and their impact on the retrieval accuracy estimated by means of two different methods. Based on this extended airborne DWL dataset, which includes simultaneous backscatter and wind measurements, different processes associated with the Saharan dust transport are investigated. Measurements carried out in the Cabo Verde and Barbados regions revealed the presence of island-induced gravity waves. These measurements are used in combination with in-situ wind and particle number density retrievals, large eddy simulations, and wavelet analysis to determine the main characteristics of the observed waves and their interaction with the Saharan Air Layer. Finally, DWL and CALIOP measurements are used to evaluate the capabilities of the MACC global aerosol model to reproduce the Saharan dust long-range transport process during SALTRACE. A comparison and analysis of the measured and simulated average wind and dust distributions in the West African and Caribbean regions is presented. Three case studies covering different characteristic features, like the African Easterly Jet and the dust transport modulation by the African Easterly Waves, are discussed with an outlook to future campaigns and the assimilation of the data products for the ESA's future satellite missions Aeolus and EarthCARE...|$|R
