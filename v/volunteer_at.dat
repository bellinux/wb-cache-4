5|$|Kenneth {{takes some}} time off from his page duties to <b>volunteer</b> <b>at</b> an animal shelter. He claims his time on a pig farm {{will allow him to}} not emotionally connect with the dogs being held there, but he quickly names all of the dogs and adopts the many dogs {{scheduled}} to be euthanized that day. Kenneth asks for someone at TGS to adopt the dogs and Tracy quickly brings them all to Liz's apartment to continue annoying her. Liz and Tracy go to Jack to finally resolve their conflict. Jack decides that, because Liz ruined Tracy's life with her book, Tracy should be given the right to ruin her life, and he orders Liz to sign over her life rights to Tracy. Jack tells Liz a story about an accident he had ice climbing, falling into a crevasse. He broke his leg and was unable to climb upwards to escape, but by going deeper down into the crevasse he found a path out. Liz applies this story to her situation with Tracy and stops resisting him, instead suggesting that Tracy make a pornographic film based on her life. Tracy agrees and moves out of Liz's apartment. In addition, Jenna and Liz resolve their issues when they see two adult stars acting out a scene of Jenna (Caitlin Fowler) and Liz (Savanna Samson) apologizing to one another.|$|E
