However, their intentions and behaviors are different. To extend our previous work on generalized second price (GSP) auction for stimulating rational nodes for cooperation, we propose FORBID mechanism {{in this work}} to cope with Byzantine behaviors. The core of the FORBID mechanism is a decentralized reputation system. Based on available evidence, each node relies on Bayesian inference to internally update its reputation beliefs that how reliable each other node is. Different from the passive overhearing techniques such as “watchdog”, each source node under FORBID actively triggers detection process to collect evidence towards Byzantine behaviors. In addition, FORBID includes a flocking algorithm to allow careful dissemination of reputation information and thus shortens the misbehavior detection time.

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of cloud computing and the expected requirements of future Internet of Things (IoT) and 5 G network scenarios, more efficient and scalable Data Centers (DCs) will be required, offering very large pools of computational resources and storage capacity cost-effectively. Looking at todays' commercial DCs, they tend to rely on well-defined leaf-spine Data Center Network (DCN) topologies that not only offer low latency and high bisectional bandwidth, but also enhanced reliability against multiple failures. However, <b>routing</b> <b>and</b> <b>forwarding</b> solutions in such DCNs are typically based on IP, thus suffering from its limited routing scalability. In this work, we quantitatively evaluate the benefits that the Recursive InterNetwork Architecture (RINA) can bring into commercial DCNs. To this goal, we propose rule-based topological <b>routing</b> <b>and</b> <b>forwarding</b> policies tailored to the characteristics of publicly available Google's and Facebook's DCNs. These policies can be programmed in a RINA-enabled environment, enabling fast forwarding decisions in most scenarios with merely neighboring node information. Upon DCN failures, invalid forwarding rules are overwritten by exceptions. Numerical {{results show that the}} scalability of our proposal depends on the number of concurrent failures in the DCN rather than its size (e. g., number of nodes/links), dramatically reducing the total amount of <b>routing</b> <b>and</b> <b>forwarding</b> information to be stored at nodes. Furthermore, as routing information is only disseminated upon failures across the DCN, the associated communication cost of our proposals largely outperforms that of the traditional IP-based solutions.

A modified Data Vortex network architecture based on general k-ary decoding routing at each node has been proposed and different cases are compared in search for the optimum layout. For bufferless implementation, the original Data Vortex networks based on binary decoding stages are shown to achieve the best combined routing performance in throughput and latency. We specifically focus on the performance comparison between the binary decoding (k= 2) and 4 -ary decoding (k= 4) cases to illustrate the different network behaviors. The results provide insight to how the different <b>routing</b> <b>and</b> <b>forwarding</b> path arrangements affect the overall network performance in throughput and latency. The binary Data Vortex networks outperform 4 -ary networks even though a much smaller number of cylinder levels are required in a 4 -ary network.
