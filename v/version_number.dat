5|$|Backwards-incompatible versions, where code is {{expected}} to break and must be manually ported. The {{first part of the}} <b>version</b> <b>number</b> is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—for example, version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of major}} {{internal}} changes in phpng, it must receive a new major <b>version</b> <b>number</b> of PHP, {{rather than a}} minor PHP 5 release, according to PHP's release process. Major versions of PHP are allowed to break backward-compatibility of code and therefore PHP 7 presented an opportunity for other improvements beyond phpng that require backward-compatibility breaks, including wider use of exceptions, reworking variable syntax to be more consistent and complete, and the deprecation or removal of various legacy features.|$|E
5|$|Bugfix releases, which {{introduce}} no {{new features}} but fix bugs. The {{third and final}} part of the <b>version</b> <b>number</b> is incremented. These releases are made whenever {{a sufficient number of}} bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release, or roughly every 3 months. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in bugfix releases.|$|E
50|$|Note: There is no {{official}} version 4 to 8, because after FrontPage {{was included in}} some Office editions, the FrontPage <b>version</b> <b>numbers</b> followed their Office <b>version</b> <b>numbers.</b> Nonetheless, <b>version</b> <b>numbers</b> may appear in the meta tags of HTML code generated by these versions of FrontPage.|$|R
5000|$|Brasero {{was later}} {{integrated}} into GNOME and the <b>version</b> <b>numbers</b> were aligned with GNOME desktop <b>version</b> <b>numbering.</b> Ars Technica reviewed Brasero 2.26, then the newest version, in March 2009, saying: ...|$|R
50|$|There are no Visio {{versions}} 7, 8, or 9, {{because after}} Microsoft acquired and branded Visio as a Microsoft Office product, the Visio <b>version</b> <b>numbers</b> followed the Office <b>version</b> <b>numbers.</b> <b>Version</b> 13 was skipped.|$|R
5|$|Releases {{are named}} by year but have {{internal}} version numbers as well. The internal <b>version</b> <b>number</b> was advanced to 15.x in the 2008 edition {{to match the}} Norton AntiVirus release of the same year. As of the 2013 (20.x) release the product has dropped the year from its name, although it still is referenced in some places.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen {{months after}} the release of version 2.0, Microsoft skipped version 3.0 and {{released}} Microsoft Security Essentials 4.0. A public beta program started on 18 November 2011, when Microsoft sent out invitations to potential participants without announcing a <b>version</b> <b>number.</b> The first beta version was released on 29 November 2011, and the final build on 24 April 2012. Microsoft subsequently initiated a pre-release program that provides volunteers with the latest beta version and accepts feedback.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbering}} scheme for the point releases up to Debian 4.0 was {{to include the}} letter r (for revision) after the main <b>version</b> <b>number</b> and then {{the number of the}} point release; for example, the latest point release of version 4.0 is 4.0r9. This scheme was chosen because a new dotted version would make the old one look obsolete and vendors would have trouble selling their CDs.|$|E
50|$|A {{practice}} in the software industry is to make major jumps in numeric major or minor <b>version</b> <b>numbers</b> for reasons which do not seem (to {{many members of the}} program's audience) to merit the marketing <b>version</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
50|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with <b>version</b> <b>numbers</b> and {{to indicate that}} Tera Term developed by Yutaka was more recent than version 3.1.3 from Ayera Technologies, {{it was decided to}} give this branch of Tera Term Professional <b>version</b> <b>numbers</b> starting 4.xx.|$|R
50|$|The odd minor <b>version</b> <b>numbers,</b> like 5.3 and 5.5 {{are for the}} Gnus {{versions}} bundled with GNU Emacs. The even <b>version</b> <b>numbers</b> are the unbundled releases. So for example, Gnus 5.5 {{is similar}} to Gnus 5.4, but bundled with Emacs 20.1.|$|R
25|$|The command uname -r in Terminal {{will show}} the Darwin <b>version</b> <b>number,</b> and the command uname -v {{will show the}} XNU build version string, which {{includes}} the Darwin <b>version</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
25|$|Each Ubuntu release has a <b>version</b> <b>number</b> that {{consists}} {{of the year and}} month number of the release. For example, the first release was Ubuntu 4.10 as it was released on 20 October 2004. Version numbers for future versions are provisional; if the release is delayed the <b>version</b> <b>number</b> changes accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Releases are {{identified}} by a four-part <b>version</b> <b>number,</b> e.g. 42.0.2311.90 (Windows Stable release April 14, 2015). The components are major.minor.build.patch.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Version</b> <b>numbers</b> {{very quickly}} evolve from simple {{integers}} (1, 2, ...) to rational numbers (2.08, 2.09, 2.10)and then to non-numeric [...] "numbers" [...] such as 4:3.4.3-2. These complex <b>version</b> <b>numbers</b> are therefore better treated as character strings. Operating systems that include package management facilities (such as all non-trivial Linux or BSD distributions) {{will use a}} distribution-specific algorithm for comparing <b>version</b> <b>numbers</b> of different software packages. For example, the ordering algorithms of Red Hat and derived distributions differ {{to those of the}} Debian-like distributions.|$|R
50|$|This {{marked a}} {{transition}} to giving much less weight to major <b>version</b> <b>numbers,</b> with 5 more major <b>version</b> <b>numbers</b> used by September of that year (5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), compared to 4 in nearly a decade of Firefox development (1, 2, 3, 4).|$|R
50|$|With {{the release}} of SP08, the <b>version</b> <b>numbers</b> {{have been changed to}} align with and match SAP HANA’s <b>version</b> <b>numbers</b> to reflect the product’s {{continuous}} integration with SAP HANA. The actual release title SP03 is a follow-on to SP02, covering all platforms not affected by the release.|$|R
25|$|PlayStation Home {{underwent}} {{weekly maintenance}} on Wednesdays (formerly Thursdays), which came with weekly content updates that included new spaces, games, or items. The core updates provided bug fixes and expanded {{the social and}} gameplay aspects of Home. The beta received several updates that included giving the users the ability to access the patio of their Harbour Studio, to access the 'Menu Pad', and to access the shopping complex. After location-affecting updates, the location had to be re-downloaded. Content updates {{did not affect the}} <b>version</b> <b>number,</b> while core client updates affected the <b>version</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} FASTA/Pearson {{format is}} described in the documentation for the FASTA suite of programs. It can be downloaded with any free distribution of FASTA (see fasta20.doc, fastaVN.doc or fastaVN.me—where VN is the <b>Version</b> <b>Number).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{final version}} of Windows 9x was Windows ME, {{released}} in September 2000 with an internal <b>version</b> <b>number</b> of 4.9. All future versions of Windows, starting with Windows XP, {{would be based on}} the Windows NT codebase.|$|E
50|$|By {{analyzing}} flow data, {{a picture}} of traffic flow and traffic volume in a network can be built. The NetFlow record format has evolved over time, hence the inclusion of <b>version</b> <b>numbers.</b> Cisco maintains details of the different <b>version</b> <b>numbers</b> and {{the layout of the}} packets for each version.|$|R
50|$|PhysTechSoft {{was formed}} in 1991 in Moscow, Russia by {{graduates}} and members of MIPT, informally known as PhysTech. At the end of 1993, PhysTechSoft released the first commercially available PTS-DOS as PTS-DOS v6.4. The <b>version</b> <b>numbering</b> followed MS-DOS <b>version</b> <b>numbers,</b> as Microsoft released MS-DOS 6.2 in November 1993.|$|R

25|$|J2SE 5.0 (September 30, 2004) – Codename Tiger. It was {{originally}} numbered 1.5, {{which is still}} used as the internal <b>version</b> <b>number.</b> Developed under JSR 176, Tiger added several significant new language features including the for-each loop, generics, autoboxing and var-args.|$|E
25|$|Visual Studio 2005's {{internal}} <b>version</b> <b>number</b> is 8.0 {{while the}} file format version is 9.0. Microsoft released Service Pack 1 for Visual Studio 2005 on 14 December 2006. An additional update for Service Pack 1 that offers Windows Vista compatibility was made available on 3 June 2007.|$|E
25|$|Windows 3.1, made {{generally}} available on March 1, 1992, featured a facelift. In August 1993, Windows for Workgroups, a special version with integrated peer-to-peer networking features and a <b>version</b> <b>number</b> of 3.11, was released. It was sold along Windows 3.1. Support for Windows 3.1 ended on December 31, 2001.|$|E

Windows 7 has the <b>version</b> <b>number</b> NT 6.1. Since its release, Windows 7 has had one service pack.|$|E
25|$|The SeaMonkey Council has now trademarked {{the name}} {{with help from}} the Mozilla Foundation. The project uses a {{separate}} numbering scheme, with the first release being called SeaMonkey 1.0. Despite having a different name and <b>version</b> <b>number,</b> SeaMonkey 1.0 is based on the same code as Mozilla Suite 1.7.|$|E
25|$|By October 16, 2006, {{distributors}} {{using the}} Windows Media DRM protection, such as Sky Anytime, were using a patched codec. On September 6, 2007, Microsoft updated IBX to version 11.0.6000.7000, {{in an attempt}} to thwart circumvention efforts by variants of the original program. And, as of November 28, 2007, DRM Removal under Windows XP on new installs or updated computers (i.e. those that already contain IBX version 11.0.6000.7000), is not possible without rolling back to Windows Media Player 10. In 2008 another patched version of FairUse4WM was released, allowing it to work with Windows Vista, and IBX versions lower than 11.0.6000.6324. In a ploy to confuse the abusers or software tools, Microsoft revisited the controversial 11.0.6000.6324 <b>version</b> <b>number,</b> releasing a new IBX version, but giving the file a deceptive older <b>version</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
