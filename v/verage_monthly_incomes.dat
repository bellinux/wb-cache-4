40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe the socio-economic conditions of child-headed households in Gauteng, so as to measure the extent of poverty among these children. In order to do this, the study includes an assessment of the size and sources of the <b>monthly</b> <b>income</b> of child-headed households in Gauteng. The contribution by the different sources of <b>income</b> to total <b>monthly</b> <b>income</b> is also analysed.
