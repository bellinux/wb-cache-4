25|$|A <b>videoconference</b> {{system is}} {{generally}} higher cost than a videophone and deploys greater capabilities. A <b>videoconference</b> (also {{known as a}} videoteleconference) allows two or more locations to communicate via live, simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions. This is often accomplished {{by the use of}} a multipoint control unit (a centralized distribution and call management system) or by a similar non-centralized multipoint capability embedded in each videoconferencing unit. Again, technology improvements have circumvented traditional definitions by allowing multiple party videoconferencing via web-based applications.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the capabilities and {{the requirements for}} integrating <b>videoconferencing</b> technology into the Army's communication system. As the bandwidth requirements for <b>videoconferencing</b> are lowered and the bandwidth availability increases, it is becoming more feasible to incorporate a <b>videoconferencing</b> system into a commander's communication structure. The current family of <b>videoconferencing</b> equipment is reviewed and current standards that govern <b>videoconferencing</b> are examined. <b>Videoconferencing</b> systems are described in both a tactical and garrison environment {{with an emphasis on}} bandwidth requirements, survivability, and system security. Also, current tactical examples of <b>videoconferencing</b> use are discussed to provide insight as to the possible future uses of systems. Currently <b>videoconferencing</b> systems are used for staff planning, videomedicine, and videotraining. Finally, a projected <b>videoconferencing</b> architecture for a corps/division is analyzed with possible locations of the <b>videoconferencing</b> sites and communication systems that could link the <b>videoconferencing</b> sites together. A breakdown of possible users is provided to show that <b>videoconferencing</b> can play a successful support role in the Army. Captain, United States Arm...|$|R

Another witness, Shawan Jabarin, General Director of the Palestinian human-rights organisation Al Haq, had to be heard by <b>videoconference,</b> as he has been subject to a travel ban by Israel since 2006 preventing him from leaving the West Bank on the grounds that he is {{a senior member of the}} Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.|$|E
25|$|On 3 November, Rau {{refused to}} talk to the {{psychologist}} and, on 6 November, was scheduled for an assessment by a psychiatrist, Dr Andrew Fruckacz, who recommended that she be taken to a hospital. He could not make a certain diagnosis, but he believed that schizophrenia was a possibility, along with a personality disorder. A psychiatrist from Glenside Mental Health Service, a campus of the Royal Adelaide Hospital, was told about Anna's behaviour, and said that her problems were behavioural, and not mental-health related. The Rural and Remote Mental Health Service (RRMHS) offered a <b>videoconference,</b> but Baxter officials instead wanted Anna to be admitted to a hospital, because they believed that she would not cooperate with a video assessment. On 17 November, the RRMHS took Anna off the waiting list for hospital treatment, without informing officials at Baxter, who believed that their request was still being considered.|$|E
40|$|Drawing on {{a decade}} of {{evaluation}} research into <b>videoconferencing</b> in English schools, this paper explores the relative lack of pedagogical innovation in the educational application of <b>videoconferencing.</b> Initial surveys on the frequency and patterns of use of <b>videoconferencing</b> provided baseline data for selected case studies involving in-depth interviews with key personnel involved in the deployment of <b>videoconferencing</b> and observations of lessons in which <b>videoconferencing</b> was being used. Data analysis reveals that the main models of <b>videoconferencing</b> use were either ‘substitution’ (<b>videoconferencing</b> replacing face-to-face curriculum delivery) or ‘enhancement’ (whereby <b>videoconferencing</b> augments traditional pedagogical practices). Examples of ‘adaptive’ use (exploring the innovative potential of <b>videoconferencing)</b> were relatively rare. This apparent conservatism, {{at odds with the}} emergence of shifting pedagogies with other ICT tools, was allied to <b>videoconferencing</b> being positioned as an ‘orphan’ technology, whereby interested teachers were offered quasi-autonomy – that is, power to innovate was limited by highly localised policy and curricular systems. The authors conclude that for <b>videoconferencing</b> to enter the mainstream of school ICT provision, wider learning benefits need to be demonstrated to a broader audience, so that <b>videoconferencing</b> can reach its transformative potential. Ways to achieve this are presented. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R

25|$|Adoption of telepharmacy in Canada {{began as}} a {{response}} to a nationwide shortage of pharmacists. Canada's first telepharmacy service was started by a hospital in Cranbrook, British Columbia, in June 2003 in order to assist a hospital in a nearby town that was unable to hire a pharmacist. To meet the need for service, a hospital pharmacist in Cranbrook began using telepharmacy technology to oversee pharmacy technicians at the other hospital. A similar service was subsequently extended to other small hospitals in the province; it is also used to provide coverage when a hospital's sole pharmacist is absent due to illness or vacation. Remote dispensing machines for medication began operation in Ontario, Canada, in 2007. After a patient inserts a prescription into the dispensing machine, the prescription is scanned and the patient is connected by telephone <b>videoconference</b> to a pharmacist at a remote site. The pharmacist reviews the prescription, discusses the patient's medication history, and authorizes the machine to dispense medication to the patient. The machines proved successful, with one assessment revealing that 96% of patients using them had their prescription filled in under five minutes. As of 2009, a hospital in Ontario, Canada, was using telepharmacy services in addition to retaining a pharmacist at the hospital; the telepharmacist reviews medication orders, while the on-site pharmacist works with patients and oversees medication safety in the facility. Thus telepharmacy support allows the on-site pharmacist to focus on the more sensitive and nuanced tasks for which physical presence is most helpful.|$|E

Because they live in New York City, collaborating closely with the production team in Burbank required two-hour-long transcontinental videoconferences nearly every weekday for about 14 months. For each song they composed, they recorded a demo in their home studio (with both of them singing the lyrics and Lopez accompanying on piano), then emailed it to Burbank for discussion at the next <b>videoconference.</b> Lopez and Anderson-Lopez {{were aware of the}} fact that their work would be compared to that of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman from the Disney Renaissance era, and whenever they felt lost, they asked [...] "What would Ashman do?" [...] In the end, they wrote 25 songs for the film, of which eight made it into the final version. One song ("For the First Time in Forever") had a reprise and the other ("Let It Go") was covered by Demi Lovato over the final credits, for a total of ten songs. Seven of the 17 that did not make it were later released on the deluxe edition soundtrack.|$|E

[...] Williams found it beneficial to collaborate with two separate firms, Devlin's company and Stufish, on the stage because of their contrasting work methods. Devlin's team created physical models, while Lipson's team made animations and collaborated with Tait on construction drawings.
