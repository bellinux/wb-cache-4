50|$|The F 402 has {{an unusual}} feature, {{which is that}} the control stick hangs from the ceiling of the cockpit, and the rudder control is a <b>vertical</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The carrier put {{the driver}} and {{commander}} at the front sitting side-by-side; the driver to the right. The Ford Flathead V8 engine that powered it {{was placed in the}} centre of the vehicle with the final drive at the rear. The suspension and running gear were based on that used on the Vickers light tank series using Horstmann springs. Directional control was through a (<b>vertical)</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> Small turns moved the front road wheel assembly warping the track so the vehicle drifted to that side. Further movement of the wheel braked the appropriate track to give a turn.|$|E
50|$|They {{were one}} of the first {{companies}} to provide storage for dry goods on their vehicles, and demonstrated a type AER float with a grocery box behind the cab at the 1955 Dairy Show. The box included an ice compartment, to keep the goods fresh in hot weather. Their exhibits at the 1958 Dairy Show included a standard 25 cwt milk float with a walk-through cab and a <b>vertical</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> which was fitted with a contactor-type controller. They also featured a chassis with a hydraulically actuated carbon-pile controller, designed to give smoother starting. The controller was still in the design phase, but was expected to be available as on option on vehicles in early 1959.|$|E
50|$|At the 1953 Dairy Show, Sidney Holes showcased the new Standon model, {{developed}} from their 4-wheeled PCV. It included a platform at the front, {{on which the}} controls were mounted, and which provided standing space for the roundsman. A <b>vertical</b> <b>steering</b> column and <b>wheel</b> were mounted in {{the centre of the}} platform, and the automatic controller was activated by a foot-operated switch. Construction was of light alloy, to reduce the weight, and top speed was 8 mph. The vehicle had a range of 15 mi, and was aimed at rounds in densely populated areas, where the task would be too strenuous for a roundsman with a PCV, but the extra cost of a heavier vehicle could not be justified.|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from the}} steel hull the {{principal}} {{difference to the}} wooden hulled Oakley was {{the elimination of the}} complicated water ballast self-righting system; the Solent derived its self-righting capability from its watertight superstructure. The class was the last design of the traditional displacement-type lifeboat to come from the drawing boards of the RNLI. There were (unofficial) Mark I and Mark II versions of the class, the first eight boats having a <b>vertical</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with wheelhouse access via sliding doors at the forward end of the wheelhouse on each side, while the last three has a seated steering position with hinged wheelhouse doors at the after end of the wheelhouse. The Mark II entered service in 1972. The first four boats (ON 1007-1010) and the last three (ON 1019-1021) were built at Cowes by Groves & Guttridge. The second four (ON 1011-1014) were built at Gosport by Camper & Nicholson.|$|E
5000|$|In 1956 they {{launched}} the Ross Auto 25, which could carry a payload of 25 cwt when {{fitted with a}} milk float body, but with a low frame height of just 1.5 ft, could also be fitted with a refuse collection body, or {{could be used as}} a tractor unit, when it could carry 1 ton and pull a 1-ton trailer. It was 4 ft wide, and came fitted with a [...] motor, which was mounted on Metalastic rubber bushes, to reduce shock loads to the transmission system. Two racks of batteries were mounted either side of the chassis, and battery capacities of 161 Amp-hours to 240 Amp-hours could be accommodated, depending on the use to which the vehicle would be put. The batteries were designed so that they could easily be replaced with fully charged batteries if they became flat. Control was by a two or three speed fully automatic controller and contactor assembly. The vehicle was extremely manoeuvrable, having a turning circle of only 20 ft, and depending on the gear ratio of the back axle, had a top speed of 8 or 16 mph. [...] Ross exhibited a four-wheel ride-on float with a <b>vertical</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> at the 1958 Dairy Show. It was the first time they had attended the show, and the 20 cwt vehicle had a range of 12 - 20 miles and a speed of 10-12 mph.|$|E
5000|$|Lewis Electruks {{were built}} by TH Lewis Ltd of Watford, a company closely {{associated}} with London's Express Dairy Company. Lewis began building milk floats, milk carts and horse-drawn vehicles for Express Dairies in 1873, and the business became a limited company in 1899. It {{was taken over by}} Express in 1931, as part of a reorganisation of their business. TH Lewis designed two types of electric vehicle for Express, the first of which entered service in 1934. This was a 3-wheeled pedestrian controlled vehicle with a 3.5 cwt payload, which had a fixed speed of 3 mph on level ground. The battery drove a [...] motor which was connected to the rear axle by reduction gearing, and this configuration gave a range of around 10 mi. They were one of the first companies to provide storage for dry goods on their vehicles, and demonstrated a type AER 4-wheeled float with a grocery box behind the cab at the 1955 Dairy Show. Their exhibits at the 1958 Dairy Show included a standard 25 cwt milk float with a walk-through cab and a <b>vertical</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> The company was acquired by Austin Crompton Parkinson, makers of Morrison Electricar floats, in 1961, and Morrisons continued to make two of their models, the Electruk Rider, which became the model E15, and a pedestrian controlled vehicle, which became the model DPC3. Both Express Dairies and the London Co-operative Society had large fleets of the Electruk Rider, and continued to add to them with purchases of the E15.|$|E

50|$|A higher {{steering}} ratio {{means that the}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned more to get the wheels turning, {{but it will be}} easier to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> A lower <b>steering</b> ratio means that the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned less to get the wheels turning, but it will be harder to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher {{steering ratio}}, which will make the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> easier to turn. If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier to turn, so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is therefore harder to turn.|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{pertains to}} an ergonomic <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim {{designed to promote}} a neutral position to the forearm, reducing stress and fatigue by discouraging fixed wrist positions, i. e., flexion and ulnar deviation. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim of the invention provides a more comfortable driving position, reduces injury associated with airbag deployment, and reduces stress on hands and wrists. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim has one or more hand grip portions that deviate from the XY plane away from the driver.

50|$|Prior to Nintendo's own Wii <b>Wheel,</b> several {{third-party}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> accessories {{had been}} introduced for the Wii Remote. One released by Ubisoft, the Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel,</b> was developed by Thrustmaster. It is bundled with certain games, such as Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT Pro Series. The accessory, which is only for aesthetic/ergonomic enhancement, is meant for driving-style gameplay in which the Wii Remote would be held lengthwise in a two-handed gamepad orientation, steering the subject by tilting the controller. The Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> is also sold separately. Since the Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> was revealed, other similarly designed <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> accessories have been produced, including the Wii Racing Wheel by Intec.|$|R

50|$|The first button {{added to}} the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> was a switch to {{activate}} the car's electric horn. Traditionally located on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> hub or center pad, the horn switch was sometimes placed on the spokes or activated via a decorative horn ring which obviated the necessity to move a hand away from the rim. Electrical connections are made via a slip ring. A further development, the Rim Blow <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> integrated the horn switch into the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim.|$|R
