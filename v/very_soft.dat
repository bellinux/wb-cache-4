5|$|Clay {{is usually}} hard and strong when dry, but becomes <b>very</b> <b>soft</b> when it absorbs water. The dry clay helps hold an earth wall together, {{but if the}} wall is {{directly}} exposed to rain, or to water leaking down from the roof, it may become saturated and collapse.|$|E
5|$|The living {{brain is}} <b>very</b> <b>soft,</b> having a gel-like {{consistency}} similar to soft tofu. The cortical layers of neurons constitute {{much of the}} brain's grey matter, while the deeper subcortical regions of myelinated axons, make up the white matter.|$|E
5|$|Lead is a <b>very</b> <b>soft</b> metal with a Mohs {{hardness}} of 1.5; {{it can be}} scratched with a fingernail. It {{is quite}} malleable and somewhat ductile. The bulk modulus of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8GPa. In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2GPa; copper 137.8GPa; and mild steel 160–169GPa. Lead's tensile strength, at 12–17 MPa, is low (that of aluminium is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, and mild steel 15 times higher); it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or antimony.|$|E

40|$|We {{find that}} the {{hierarchical}} organization of the potential energy landscape in a model supercooled liquid {{can be related to}} a change in the spatial distribution of soft normal modes. For groups of nearby minima, between which fast relaxation processes typically occur, the localization of the <b>soft</b> modes is <b>very</b> similar. The spatial distribution of soft regions changes, instead, for minima between which transitions relevant to structural relaxation occur. This may be the reason why the soft modes are able to predict spatial heterogeneities in the dynamics. Nevertheless, the <b>very</b> <b>softest</b> modes are only weakly correlated with dynamical heterogeneities, and instead show higher statistical overlap with regions in the local minima that would undergo non-affine rearrangements if subjected to a shear deformation. This feature of the supercooled liquid is reminiscent of the behavior of non-affine deformations in amorphous solids, where the <b>very</b> <b>softest</b> modes identify the loci of plastic instabilities.

5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, we are {{beginning}} to see a shift in gender representation in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion designers are now starting to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a <b>very</b> <b>soft</b> delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E
5|$|Of Human Feelings was {{recorded}} with a Sony PCM-1600 two-track digital recorder, a rare item at the time. According to journalist Howard Mandel, the passages {{played by the}} band sounded neither <b>very</b> <b>soft</b> or loud on the album, {{because it had been}} mixed with a middle-frequency range and compressed dynamics. Because of the equipment used, Coleman did not embellish the album with added effects and avoided overdubbing, multi-tracking, and remixing. According to him, Of Human Feelings was the first jazz album to be digitally recorded in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is {{during the summer}} rainy season (mainly June to August in India) but can vary. Laboratory {{studies have found that}} long day illumination and high humidity trigger gonadal growth. The song of the male is <b>very</b> <b>soft</b> but complex and variable, audible only at close range. This song described as a jingle consists of a series of high notes followed by a croaky rattle and ending in a slurred whistle. When singing the male sits in what is called the slope posture—erect with the head feathers raised.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the wood}} {{recovered}} from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and <b>very</b> <b>soft.</b> Where possible, pieces of wood in good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the wood in heated tanks in a solution of polyethylene glycol and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing {{the water in the}} wood with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from the tank and wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.|$|E
5|$|Indium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolIn and atomic number 49. It is a post-transition metal {{that makes up}} 0.21parts per million of the Earth's crust. <b>Very</b> <b>soft</b> and malleable, indium has a melting point higher than sodium and gallium, but lower than lithium and tin. Chemically, indium is similar to gallium and thallium, and it is largely intermediate between the two {{in terms of its}} properties. Indium was discovered in 1863 by Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter by spectroscopic methods. They named it for the indigo blue line in its spectrum. Indium was isolated the next year.|$|E
60|$|Chickadee's nest {{is always}} neat and {{comfortable}} and interesting, just like himself. It {{is a rare}} treat to find it. He selects an old knot-hole, generally on the sheltered side of a dry limb, and digs out the rotten wood, making a deep and sometimes winding tunnel downward. In the dry wood at the bottom he makes a little round pocket and lines it with the <b>very</b> <b>softest</b> material. When one finds such a nest, with five or six white eggs delicately touched with pink lying at the bottom, {{and a pair of}} chickadees gliding about, half fearful, half trustful, it is altogether such a beautiful little spot that I know hardly a boy who would be mean enough to disturb it.|$|R

5|$|Lactarius deterrimus is an edible mushroom, but is {{much less}} {{appreciated}} than the similar L.deliciosus. The first tastes slightly bitter and is often infested by maggots. Like L.deliciosus, this fungus is mainly stir-fried in butter or oil; if it is cooked in water, the flesh becomes <b>very</b> <b>soft.</b> Young fruit bodies can be also pickled, or dried for later use. As the fungus is often heavily infested by maggots, skilled mushroom pickers prefer young fruit bodies. The urine discolours to red if {{a large amount of}} milk caps are eaten, but this is entirely harmless and is not evidence for an impairment to health. The red-coloured azulene compounds, ingested with the mushroom food, are more or less excreted with the urine.|$|E
5|$|Peat {{is found}} in thick, {{plentiful}} layers across the Pennines and Scottish Borders, {{and there are many}} large coalfields, including the Great Northern, Lancashire and South Yorkshire Coalfields. Millstone grit, a distinctive coarse-grained rock used to make millstones, is widespread in the Pennines, and the variety of other rock types is reflected in the architecture of the region, such as the bright red sandstone seen in buildings in Chester, the cream-buff Yorkstone and the distinctive purple Doddington sandstone. These sandstones also mean that apart from the east coast, most of Northern England has <b>very</b> <b>soft</b> water, and this has influenced not just industry, but even the blends of tea enjoyed in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{brains of}} {{vertebrates}} {{are made of}} <b>very</b> <b>soft</b> tissue. Living brain tissue is pinkish {{on the outside and}} mostly white on the inside, with subtle variations in color. Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the skull from the brain. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another, forming the blood–brain barrier, which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens (though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs, thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain).|$|E

5|$|Because {{pure silver}} is <b>very</b> <b>soft,</b> most silver used for these {{purposes}} is alloyed with copper, with finenesses of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One drawback is the easy tarnishing of {{silver in the}} presence of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly; base metals like zinc, cadmium, silicon, and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing. The usual solutions for restoring the lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver, and cleaning off the layer of tarnish with a paste; the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the silver concurrently.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} {{spots of}} the spotted green pigeon {{are not unique}} among pigeons, but are also seen in the spot-winged pigeon (Columba maculosa) and the speckled pigeon (C. guinea), and {{are the result of}} lack of melanin deposition during development. The yellow-buff coloured spots are very worn, while less worn feathers have white tips; this indicates that the former were stained during life or represent a different stage of plumage, and that the latter were fresher. The plumage of the spotted green pigeon was distinct in being <b>very</b> <b>soft</b> compared to that of other pigeons, perhaps due to the body feathers being proportionally long. The hackles were not as elongated as those of the Nicobar pigeon, and the feathers did not differ from those of other pigeons in their microstructure. The plumage was also distinct in being very pigmented, except for the tips of the feathers, and even the down was dark, unlike that of most other birds (a feature otherwise seen in aberrant plumage).|$|E
