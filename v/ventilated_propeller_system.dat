50|$|An {{alternative}} to the supercavitating propeller is the surface piercing, or <b>ventilated</b> <b>propeller.</b> These propellers are designed to intentionally cleave the water and entrain atmospheric air to fill the void, {{which means that the}} resulting gas layer on the forward face of the propeller blade consists of air instead of water vapour. Less energy is thus used, and the surface-piercing propeller generally enjoys lower drag than the supercavitating principle. The surface-piercing propeller also has wedge-shaped blades, and propellers may be designed that can operate in both supercavitating and surface-piercing mode.|$|R

40|$|Ships {{and marine}} {{structures}} operating with propellers will {{from time to}} time experience severe, instantaneous thrust and torque losses to air drawing to the propeller. This is known as ventilation, and it may cause serious issues for vessels operating at rough seas. Not only will ventilation lead loss of propulsive power, the dynamic and fluctuating nature of the phenomenon may cause propeller racing, leading to damages to the mechanical parts of the engine. There has been a large amount of research on <b>ventilating</b> <b>propellers</b> over the last few years. But there is still a need for a simple mathematical model of the forces at stake during ventilation. As part of this thesis effort has been made towards creating a mathematical model able to capture the important physical aspects of propellers during ventilation. The basis for is a complete momentum theory, able to capture both axially and tangentially induced velocities. Comparing the mathematical propeller model against experimental results, as well as against more established programs such as OpenProp has shown that the numerical method is not of very high accuracy. Testing propeller geometry against experimental results did in fact yield quite large errors. On other occasions the resulting forces calculated by the numerical model coincide fairly well with other solutions. Even though the final numerical model is quite simple, and prone to inaccuracies it is still able to capture some of the important aspects of <b>ventilating</b> <b>propellers.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the cathodic protection of a <b>propeller</b> <b>system,</b> installed in a large-medium sized ship, was investigated. This system is constituted by a 17 4 PH propeller shaft, concentrically mounted in an AISI 304 stern tube. Sea water is usually pumped in the interspace between these two metallic parts for cooling the <b>propeller</b> <b>system</b> during navigation, but in {{the main part of}} the year it remains stagnant because the ship is berthed in the harbour. Considering that such conditions determined critical localized corrosion phenomena on the <b>propeller</b> <b>system,</b> in this work the {{efficiency of}} the cathodic protection, performed by plain steel anodes, was tested. A real <b>propeller</b> <b>system</b> (about 3 m in length) was slightly modified for monitoring the potential in different points by the use of local probes. Even the protection current was suitably monitored. The tests were performed both with stagnant and with moving sea water up to a flow rate of 40 L/min, in order to find the same conditions of the ship during navigation. From the experimental results, the {{efficiency of the}} cathodic protection was good even if the circulating water with the higher flow rate represents a critical condition...|$|R

The aim {{of this paper is}} to employ a sensitivity study for the total thrust of a ducted twin counter-rotating <b>propeller</b> <b>system</b> design for UAV applications using computational fluid dynamics. Two factors were investigated: propeller spacing and difference between blades pitch angle. Using 4 discrete values for both factors, 16 designs were analyzed and evaluated.

A ducted twin counter-rotating <b>propeller</b> <b>system</b> was modeled in ANSYS CFX. Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model was used for steady state simulations.

40|$|A {{partially}} submerged propeller {{theory was}} developed by employing a singularity distribution method. Unsteady pressure doublets and pressure sources represented the blade camber and blade-and-cavity thickness respectively. The induced velocities were derived by reducing the formula to a lifting-line configuration. The free-surface effect was considered by use of the image method. The induced velocities contained the singular integrals of 5 th order, which are usually numerical unstable. An {{effort was made to}} derive numerically stable formulae from these singular equations by applying a method similar to the induction-factor method of Morgan & Wrench (1965) and Lerbs (1952) used for steady-state fully wetted propeller problems. These new formulae are not only applicable to the present partially submerged <b>ventilated</b> <b>propeller</b> problem, but also to general unsteady subcavitating and cavitating propeller problems such as propeller starting-up and non-periodic loading problems. By combining the two-dimensional water entry-and-exit theory of Wang (1979), the thrust and torque coefficients were calculated for representative partially submerged propellers and favourably compared with the experimental data...|$|R

40|$|Control {{systems for}} {{underwater}} vehicles {{have reached the}} level of sophistication where they are limited by the dynamic performance of the thrust actuators. Standard fixed-pitch propellers {{have been shown to}} have very poor dynamic characteristics, particularly at low thrust levels The dynamic response of a fixed-pitch propeller is dependent upon highly non-linear transients encountered while the shaft speed approaches its steady-state value. This thesis proposes the use of a controllable pitch <b>propeller</b> <b>system</b> to address this problem. A controllable pitch propeller varies the amount of thrust produced by varying the pitch angle of the blades at a constant shaft speed. The bandwidth of this type of thrust actuator would be dependent primarily on the speed at which the pitch angle of the blades are changed. A variable pitch <b>propeller</b> <b>system</b> suitable for retrofit into an ROV is designed and built. The system is designed for maximal pitch angle bandwidth with low actuator power consumption.
