5|$|Norman's {{mother was}} voiced by Virginia Gregg, Paul Jasmin, and Jeanette Nolan, who also {{provided}} some screams for Lila's {{discovery of the}} mother's corpse. The three <b>voices</b> <b>were</b> thoroughly mixed, except for the last speech, which is all Gregg's.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1980 Leonid Popov and Valery Ryumin (Soyuz 35) {{arrived for}} the longest stay on Salyut 6, 185 days. While aboard, on 19 July, they sent their {{greetings}} to the Olympians and wished them happy starts in the live communication between the station and the Central Lenin Stadium, where the opening ceremony of the 1980 Summer Olympics was held. They appeared on the stadium's scoreboard and their <b>voices</b> <b>were</b> translated via loud speakers.|$|E
5|$|The Sisters of Fate– Featured in God of War II, {{they were}} the three sisters who {{controlled}} the fates of all mortals, gods, and Titans, and lived on the Island of Creation. All were eventually killed by Kratos when they refused {{to allow him to}} go back in time to seek revenge on Zeus. In God of War III, their <b>voices</b> <b>were</b> heard in Kratos' psyche.|$|E

5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he was unsure whether the game {{would be fun to}} play; after the <b>voices</b> <b>were</b> added, he could see the characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly if he felt material did not work when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately, with their conversations in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E
5|$|By early 1570, the Ottoman {{preparations}} and {{the warnings}} {{sent by the}} Venetian bailo at Constantinople, Marco Antonio Barbaro, had convinced the Signoria that war was imminent. Reinforcements and money were sent post-haste to Crete and Cyprus. In March 1570, an Ottoman envoy was sent to Venice, bearing an ultimatum that demanded the immediate cession of Cyprus. Although some <b>voices</b> <b>were</b> raised in the Venetian Signoria advocating the cession of the island in exchange for land in Dalmatia and further trading privileges, the hope of assistance from the other Christian states stiffened the Republic's resolve, and the ultimatum was categorically rejected.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino based Allen's {{characterization}} on Robin, the shorter-haired female {{protagonist of}} her one-shot comic Zone. She designed Allen's clothing to resemble {{that of the}} nineteenth century, giving him a ribbon tie and other accessories to appear gentlemanly. Hoshino gave him a pentagram-shaped scar for an intimidating image, and a calm demeanor different from her typical rambunctious, rude characters. In the anime television series, Allen was voiced by Sanae Kobayashi. The <b>voices</b> <b>were</b> recast for the 2016 anime television series D.Gray-man Hallow, with Ayumu Murase replacing Kobayashi. In the English adaptation of the anime series, Allen has been voiced by Todd Haberkorn.|$|E

5|$|Sound {{technicians}} {{spent the}} early part of the year trying to find the right sounds. Some, such as animal sounds like those of tigers and walruses, were bought. Human <b>voices</b> <b>were</b> also used. Fran Walsh contributed to the Nazgûl scream and David Farmer the Warg howls. Other sounds were unexpected: the fell beast's screech is taken from that of a donkey, and the mûmakils bellow comes from the beginning and end of a lion's roar. In addition, ADR was used for most of the dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Although Tenebrae was an Italian production, most of {{the cast}} spoke their {{dialogue}} in English to increase the film's chances of success in United States. For domestic audiences, the film was dubbed into Italian. The English-language dub retained Franciosa's, Saxon's and Steiner's natural voices. However, Nicolodi's voice was dubbed by Theresa Russell, Giuliano Gemma's was dubbed by David Graham, and {{most of the}} female <b>voices</b> <b>were</b> dubbed by Adrienne Posta. Michele Soavi – frequent Argento collaborator, second assistant director on Tenebrae and later a noted director in his own right – acted alongside Robin's in the second flashback scene. Another of Argento's collaborators, Fulvio Mingozzi cameoed as a hotel porter. In common with several other Argento films, close-ups of the killer's gloved hands were Argento's own. In the film's Italian-language dub, Argento also provided the opening voice-over, reading aloud descriptions of murderous actions from Neal's fictitious novel, Tenebrae.|$|E

50|$|A dropped <b>voicing</b> <b>is</b> {{where one}} or more <b>voices</b> <b>are</b> lowered by an octave {{relative}} to the default state.

5|$|The {{contributors}} to Seara and Libertatea were, in general, outspoken {{social and cultural}} critics, with diverse grievances against the establishment. Historian Lucian Boia argues that, even though Bogdan-Pitești was on the German payroll, his switch from the Francophiles {{could have been a}} genuine form of conservatism. Boia thus notes that Seara was supportive of the Central Powers from the 1914 build-up to the war, that is even before Cantacuzino had come to decide which side he liked best. The core group of Seara men included socialists of various hues: Arghezi, who claimed that Serbian nationalism was the spark of the war; Felix Aderca, who depicted the German Empire as the more progressive belligerent; and Rodion, who rendered the complains of Germanophile intellectuals from Moldavia. Others were left-wing refugees from the Russian Empire, who wanted Romania to join the Central Powers and help liberate Bessarabia: Alexis Nour, from the Poporanist faction, and the old anarchist Zamfir Arbore. Seara was also a platform for some disgruntled Romanians from Transylvania region, a Romanian irredenta under Austro-Hungarian rule. They included a mainstream Conservative commentator, Ilie Bărbulescu, who advised Romanians to not to focus on Transylvania, and prioritized action against the Russians. Two distinct <b>voices</b> <b>were</b> those of poet Dumitru Karnabatt, who identified the Entente Powers with Pan-Slavism or British imperialism; and Ion Gorun, the Transylvanian writer and Habsburg loyalist. Beyond politics, Seara came out with news on culture, selected for publishing by Ion Vinea and poet Jacques G. Costin.|$|E
5|$|Waugh's {{health in}} the winter of 1953–54 was indifferent, and he was beset with various {{personal}} anxieties that were stifling his ability to work. He was also consuming alcohol, bromide and chloral in large amounts. In search of a peaceful environment in which he could resume writing, he embarked on a sea voyage to Ceylon, but was driven to the point of madness by imagined voices that assailed him throughout the voyage. These experiences are mirrored in the novel by those of Pinfold, a successful writer in the Waugh mould who, as an antidote to his lassitude and chronic insomnia, is dosing himself with a similar regimen of drugs. This cocktail brings about a series of hallucinatory episodes during a sea voyage taken by Pinfold {{for the sake of his}} health; he hears voices that insult, taunt and threaten him. He leaves the ship, but his unseen tormentors follow him. On his return to England, his wife convinces him that the <b>voices</b> <b>were</b> imaginary, and his doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and chloral mixture. Pinfold, however, also views the episode as a private victory over the forces of evil.|$|E
