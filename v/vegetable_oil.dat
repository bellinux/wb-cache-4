40|$|Background : There is convincing {{evidence}} that replacing dietary saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) decreases risk of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, PUFA rich foods such as <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils,</b> fatty fish, and marine omega- 3 supplements are recommended. However, PUFA are easily oxidizable and there is concern about possible negative health effects from intake of oxidized lipids. Little {{is known about the}} degree of lipid oxidation in such products. Objective : To assess the content of lipid oxidation products in a large selection of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> and marine omega- 3 supplements available in Norway. Both fresh and heated <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> were studied. Design : A large selection of commercially available <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> and marine omega- 3 supplements was purchased from grocery stores, pharmacies, and health food stores in Norway. The content of lipid oxidation products were measured as peroxide value and alkenal concentration. Twelve different <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> were heated for a temperature (225 °C) and time (25 minutes) resembling conditions typically used during cooking. Results : The peroxide values were in the range 1. 04 – 10. 38 meq/kg for omega- 3 supplements and in the range 0. 60 – 5. 33 meq/kg for fresh <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils.</b> The concentration range of alkenals was 158. 23 – 932. 19 nmol/mL for omega- 3 supplements and 33. 24 – 119. 04 nmol/mL for <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils.</b> After heating, a 2. 9 – 11. 2 fold increase in alkenal concentration was observed for <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils.</b> Conclusions : The contents of hydroperoxides and alkenals in omega- 3 supplements are higher than in <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils.</b> After heating <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils,</b> a large increase in alkenal concentration was observed...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} {{literature}} concerning using <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> {{as a replacement for}} diesel fuel. The term <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> as used in this paper refers to <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> which have not been modified by transesterification or similar processes to form what is called biodiesel. The oils studied include virgin and used oils of various types including soy, rapeseed, canola, sunflower, cottonseed and similar oils. In general, raw <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> can be used successfully in short term performance tests in nearly any percentage as a replacement for diesel fuel. When tested in long term tests blends above 20 percent nearly always result in engine damage or maintenance problems. Some authors report success in using <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> as diesel fuel extenders in blends less than 20 percent even in long term durability studies.

40|$|<b>Vegetable</b> <b>oils,</b> {{which are}} used as base oils for the {{production}} of environmentally friendly lubricants are triglycerides that make up the complex mixture of fatty acids with different chain length and number of double bonds. Triglycerides are rapidly biodegradable and have excellent lubricity properties. Advantages of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> compared to mineral are reflected in the following characteristics: toxicity, rapid biodegradability, good lubricity, high flash point, high viscosity index and low volatility. Disadvantages of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> compared to mineral are: poor oxidative stability, poor flow ability at low temperatures and poor hydrolytic stability that limits their application. Poor properties of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> can be improved by adding suitable additives. However, some additives affect the appearance of the foam, which is undesirable, because of the negative influence {{on the quality of the}} lubricant, and furthermore accelerates the oxidation process of the oil. The paper presents the influence of the additives on the occurrence of foam and possible way of solving this problem.

Acceptable correlation coefficients were observed between the three methods during the analysis of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> and hydrogenated <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils.</b> EASI-MS offers not only simplicity, speed and selectivity for oil analysis but also precise quantitation of the TAG composition.

40|$|Five {{vegetable}} oils: canola, soybean, corn, cottonseed and sunflower oils {{were characterized}} {{with respect to}} their composition by gas chromatography and viscosity. The compositions of the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> suggest that they exhibit substantially different propensity for oxidation following the order of: canola < corn < cottonseed < sunflower approximate to soybean. Viscosities at 40 degrees C and 100 degrees C and the viscosity index (VI) values were determined for the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> and two petroleum oil quenchants: Microtemp 157 (a conventional slow oil) and Microtemp 153 B (an accelerated or fast oil). The kinematic viscosities of the different <b>vegetable</b> and petroleum <b>oils</b> at 40 degrees C were similar. The VI values for the different <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> were very close and varied between 209 - 220 and were all much higher than the VI values obtained for Microtemp 157 (96) and Microtemp 153 B (121). These data indicate that the viscosity variations of these <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> are substantially less sensitive to temperature variation than are the parafinic oil based Microtemp 157 and Microtemp 153 B. Although these data suggest that any of the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> evaluated could be blended with minimal impact on viscosity, the oxidative stability would surely be substantially impacted. Cooling curve analysis was performed on these <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> at 60 degrees C under non-agitated conditions. These results were compared with cooling curves obtained for Microtemp 157, a conventional, unaccelerated petroleum oil, and Microtemp 153 B, an accelerated petroleum oil under the same conditions. The results showed that cooling profiles of the different <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> were similar as expected from the VI values. However, no boiling was observed wit any of the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> and heat transfer occurs only by convection since there is no full-film boiling and nucleate boiling process as typically observed for petroleum oil quenchants, including those of this study. Therefore, high-temperature cooling is considerable faster for <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> as a class. The cooling properties obtained suggest that <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> would be especially suitable fur quenching low-hardenability steels such as carbon steels.
