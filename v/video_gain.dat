40|$|Abstract. IPTV over DSL access {{networks}} {{is becoming a}} reality. This paper studies {{the impact of the}} presence of a video-aware traffic management module in the access network on the performance of the video dejittering mechanism at the receiver. The presented numerical results illustrate that with the traffic management module, the packet loss probability at the dejittering buffer decreases. Since the traffic management module will only drop the least important enhancement layer packets of the video in case of congestion, especially the important base layer packets of the <b>video</b> <b>gain</b> from the use of the traffic management module. All results in this paper are obtained using a mathematical model. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of an all solid state television camera design, {{which uses a}} buried channel charge-coupled device (CCD) as the image sensor, was undertaken. A 380 x 488 element CCD array was utilized to ensure compatibility with 525 line transmission and display monitor equipment. Specific camera design approaches selected for study and analysis included (a) optional clocking modes for either fast (1 / 60 second) or normal (1 / 30 second) frame readout, (b) techniques for the elimination or suppression of CCD blemish effects, and (c) automatic light control and <b>video</b> <b>gain</b> control techniques to eliminate or minimize sensor overload due to bright objects in the scene. Preferred approaches were determined and integrated into a design which addresses the program requirements for a deliverable solid state TV camera...|$|E
