40|$|Borates {{are well}} known {{for their ability to}} protect wood against fungal and insects attacks. However, their use in outdoor {{applications}} is limited due to their high leachability from treated wood. In this study, monoglycerides were investigated as fixative agents to reduce boron depletion from Scots pine using a double <b>vacuum</b> <b>impregnation</b> <b>process</b> involving <b>impregnation</b> with disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT) followed by a second impregnation with the fixative agent. Significant reduction in boron leachability in samples treated with monoglycerides was observed compared to the standalone boron treated specimens. Evaluation of decay resistance of treated blocks using the brown rot fungus Poria placenta indicated a slight increase of durability, while resistance to termites attacks was strongly improved as demonstrated by the low weight losses and the high termites mortality levels observed. Monoglycerides could therefore be valuable additives to reduce boron depletion for outdoor applications in which wood is exposed to natural leaching conditions. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the use of}} {{polyvinyl}} alcohol (PVA) as boron fixative agent was investigated. Two levels of PVA (2. 5 and 4 %) were evaluated with disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT) at three concentrations (1, 2 and 4 % boric acid equivalent (BAE)) using a double <b>vacuum</b> <b>impregnation</b> <b>process</b> on Scots pine sapwood specimens. Leaching was performed according to a laboratory leaching procedure. Boron analysis using atomic absorption spectrometer showed {{a significant reduction in}} boron leachability for the samples treated with both concentrations of PVA when compared to the stand-alone boron treatment leading to boron retentions capable of preventing wood biological degradations. Decay resistance of the leached specimens was evaluated using the brown rot fungus Poria placenta. Even if complete protection was not fully achieved, an improvement in decay resistance was observed for the samples treated with DOT in presence of PVA. This leak of efficacy was attributed to a decrease in the biological activity of the complexed boron against fungi. Durability of treated wood against termite attack, evaluated using Reticulitermes santonensis, indicated a significant enhancement for the samples treated in presence of the fixative agent compared to the pure boron treatment (Résumé d'auteur) ...|$|R

However, the texture of blueberries can easily deteriorate during handling, processing and distribution, which leads to food loss. This is a particular problem when blueberries are irradiated {{as a treatment for}} food safety purposes. This research evaluated the effects of vacuum impregnation on the texture and quality of irradiated blueberries. Moisture content, texture, color, total soluble solids, pH, total titratable acidity, and total phenol amount were evaluated on Day 0 (the day of the treatment), Day 7, and Day 14 of storage at 4. 5 - 5 ?C, 50 - 55 %RH. A consumer test was also conducted. Fresh blueberries were vacuum impregnated with calcium lactate solution at 4 %, 5 %, and 6 % concentration (w/w).

The {{aim of this}} research was to evaluate the influence of drying process conditions on the physiological quality attributes of cape gooseberry (Physalis peruviana L.) impregnated under vacuum with AC and dehydrated. A factorial design was performed with two independent variables, 2 levels per variable (temperature: 50 and 60 ºC, air velocity: 2. 0 and 3. 0 m. s- 1) and three replicates per drying condition. In fact, cape gooseberry fruits were previously impregnated under vacuum with an emulsion containing calcium and vitamins B 9, C, D 3 and E, which were subjected to dehydration until a water activity of approximately 0. 6. In addition, drying rate curves presented in all cases two periods of decreasing speed. An increase of drying temperature decreases the processing time, presenting a greater AC degradation, while the air velocity offers a non-significant effect. The treatment which have allowed an AC better retention and low processing times was 60 ° C and 2 m. s- 1, reaching levels of 204. 8 ± 10. 5 mg, 137. 0 ± 34. 7 μg, 13. 6 ± 0. 9 mg, 2. 2 ± 0. 6 μg, 7. 0 ± 1. 2 mg for calcium and vitamins B 9, C, D 3 and E, respectively per 50 g serving of dehydrated cape gooseberry.

40|$|An {{extensive}} R&D {{program has}} been conducted that has confirmed the feasibility of designing and fabricating copper alloy magnets that can successfully operate at temperatures as high as 350 C. The process, originally developed {{for the possibility of}} manufacturing in-vessel resonant magnetic field perturbation (RMP) coils for JET, has been optimized for insulated magnet (and, potentially, other high temperature component) applications. One of the benefits of high temperature operation is that active cooling may no longer be required, greatly simplifying magnet/component design. These elevated temperatures are beyond the safe operating limits of conventional OFHC copper and the epoxies that bond and insulate the turns of typical magnets. This would necessitate the use an alternative copper alloy conductor such as C 18150 (CuCrZr). Coil manufacture with polyimide is very similar to conventional epoxy bonded coils. Conductors would be dry wound then impregnated with polyimide of low enough viscosity to permit saturation, then cured; similar to the <b>vacuum</b> pressure <b>impregnation</b> <b>process</b> used for conventional epoxy bonded coils. Representative polyimide insulated coils were mechanically tested at both room temperature and 350 C. Mechanical tests included turn-to-turn shear bond strength and overall polyimide adhesion strength, as well as the flexural strength of a 48 -turn polyimide-bonded coil bundle. This paper will detail the results of the testing program on coil samples. These results demonstrate mechanical properties as good, or better than epoxy bonded magnets, even at 350 C...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, N-methyl pyrrolidone, and pyridine in swelling yellow birch, beech, white pine, and Douglas-fir was determined. Changes in the radial and tangential dimensions during simple immersion were followed until maximum swelling was obtained.
