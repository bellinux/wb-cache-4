Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle, and someone with elevated lead levels may have no symptoms. Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a chronic exposure, but acute symptoms from brief, intense exposures also occur.|$|E
5|$|People {{sometimes}} suspected vampirism when a cadaver did {{not look}} as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition <b>vary</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> temperature and soil composition, {{and many of the}} signs are little known. This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all or, ironically, to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.|$|E

Exposure times <b>vary</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> weather and climate from {{a minimum of}} six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions. It is recommended by the World Health Organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage. Over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water.|$|E

Both convey the same message, but the former is structured as a single chapter, and the latter into two chapters (19 verses in first, 5 verses in second). The text is structured as verses, set to a poetic Vedic meter (exactly same number of syllables per verse of the song).|$|E

5|$|The {{gestation}} period for cats is between 64 and 67 days, {{with an average}} of 66 days. The size of a litter usually is three to five kittens, with the first litter usually smaller than subsequent litters. Kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks old, and cats normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months (females) and to 5–7 months (males), although this can <b>vary</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> breed. Females can have two to three litters per year, so may produce up to 150 kittens in their breeding span of around ten years.|$|E

The party eventually learns that the Night Masks are led by vampires, and additional clues lead them to the vampires' catacombs. After defeating the vampire Latasha, the PC travels through a portal to reach the chamber of the Night Masks' leader, Orbakh. Orbakh gives the PC the choice to either become a vampire or keep the cursed mask.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{the absence}} of crystal flaws is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} quality of a diamond. Purity and high crystalline perfection make diamonds transparent and clear, whereas its hardness, optical dispersion (luster) and chemical stability (combined with marketing), make it a popular gemstone. High thermal conductivity is also important for technical applications. Whereas high optical dispersion is an intrinsic property of all diamonds, their other properties <b>vary</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> how the diamond was created.|$|E

The relationship between Shepard and Liara can <b>vary</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> whether they were romantically involved in the original Mass Effect. The mission includes two bosses and a chase scene in which the player must control a high-speed vehicle through the skies of a city. The player may also find numerous in-game upgrades that enhance aspects of the game's weapons and armor.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} Netherlandish period, divine light {{was not well}} described: if a painter wanted to depict heavenly radiance, he {{typically}} painted an object in reflective gold. There was a focus on describing the object itself rather than {{the effect of the}} light as it fell across it. Van Eyck {{was one of the first}} to portray light's saturation, illuminating effects and gradations as it poured across the pictorial space. He detailed how an object's colour could <b>vary</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> the amount and type of light illuminating it. This play of light is evident across the panel, and especially seen on Mary's gilded dress and jewelled crown, across her hair and on her mantle.|$|E
5|$|Browerian mimicry, {{named after}} Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower, is a {{postulated}} form of automimicry; where the model {{belongs to the}} same species as the mimic. This is the analogue of Batesian mimicry within a single species, and occurs {{when there is a}} palatability spectrum within a population. Examples include the monarch and the queen from the Danainae subfamily, which feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. These species store toxins from its host plant, which are maintained even in the adult (imago) form. As levels of toxin <b>vary</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> diet during the larval stage, some individuals are more toxic than others. Less palatable organisms, therefore, mimic more dangerous individuals, with their likeness already perfected.|$|E

5|$|Carbon is {{the sixth}} element, with a {{ground-state}} electron configuration of 1s22s22p2, {{of which the}} four outer electrons are valence electrons. Its first four ionisation energies, 1086.5, 2352.6, 4620.5 and 6222.7kJ/mol, are much {{higher than those of}} the heavier group 14 elements. The electronegativity of carbon is 2.5, significantly higher than the heavier group 14 elements (1.8–1.9), but close to most of the nearby nonmetals {{as well as some of}} the second- and third-row transition metals. Carbon's covalent radii are normally taken as 77.2pm (C–C), 66.7pm (C=C) and 60.3pm (C≡C), although these may <b>vary</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> coordination number and what the carbon is bonded to. In general, covalent radius decreases with lower coordination number and higher bond order.|$|E
5|$|In high-mass main-sequence stars, the opacity is {{dominated}} by electron scattering, which is nearly constant with increasing temperature. Thus the luminosity only increases as the cube of the star's mass. For stars below 10 , the opacity becomes dependent on temperature, resulting in the luminosity varying approximately as the fourth power of the star's mass. For very low-mass stars, molecules in the atmosphere {{also contribute to the}} opacity. Below about 0.5 , the luminosity of the star varies as the mass to the power of 2.3, producing a flattening of the slope on a graph of mass versus luminosity. Even these refinements are only an approximation, however, and the mass-luminosity relation can <b>vary</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> a star's composition.|$|E

The evidence for the effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Treatments of unproven benefit used by people with MS include dietary supplementation and regimens, vitamin D, relaxation techniques such as yoga, herbal medicine (including medical cannabis), hyperbaric oxygen therapy, self-infection with hookworms, reflexology, acupuncture, and mindfulness. Regarding the characteristics of users, they are more frequently women, have had MS for a longer time, {{tend to be more}} disabled and have lower levels of satisfaction with conventional healthcare.|$|E
