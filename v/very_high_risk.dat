5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that gender differences in attachment patterns of adaptive significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> environment. Adrenarche is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the fact}} that HIT predisposes {{strongly}} to new episodes of thrombosis, it {{is not sufficient to}} simply discontinue the heparin administration. Generally, an alternative anticoagulant is needed to suppress the thrombotic tendency while the generation of antibodies stops and the platelet count recovers. To make matters more complicated, the other most commonly used anticoagulant, warfarin, should not be used in HIT until the platelet count is at least 150 x 10^9/L because there is a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of warfarin necrosis in people with HIT who have low platelet counts. Warfarin necrosis is the development of skin gangrene in those receiving warfarin or a similar vitamin K inhibitor. If the patient was receiving warfarin at the time when HIT is diagnosed, the activity of warfarin is reversed with vitamin K. Transfusing platelets is discouraged, as there is a theoretical risk that this may worsen the risk of thrombosis; the platelet count is rarely low enough to be the principal cause of significant hemorrhage.|$|E

40|$|Inherited {{breast cancer}} is {{associated}} with germline mutations in ten different genes in pathways critical to genomic integrity. BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 mutations confer <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>risks</b> of breast and ovarian cancer. p 53 and PTEN mutations lead to <b>very</b> <b>high</b> breast cancer <b>risks</b> associated with rare cancer syndromes. Mutations in CHEK 2, ATM, NBS 1, RAD 50, BRIP 1, and PALB 2 are associated with doubling of breast cancer risks. In addition, biallelic mutations in BRCA 2, BRIP 1, and PALB 2 cause Fanconi anemia. The convergence of these genes in a shared role reveals underlying biology of these illnesses and suggests still other breast cancer genes...|$|R

25|$|The risk of {{twin birth}} can vary {{depending}} on what types of fertility treatments are used. With in vitro fertilisation (IVF), this is primarily due to the insertion of multiple embryos into the uterus. Ovarian hyperstimulation without IVF has a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of multiple birth. Reversal of anovulation with clomifene (trade names including Clomid) has a relatively less but yet significant risk of multiple pregnancy.|$|E

Although comprehensive epidemiologic data are not yet available for all the health risks associated with morbid obesity, it is likely to be associated with <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>risks</b> of diseases with a large impact on the individual and the health system, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, cancer, osteoarthritis, infertility, depression, and mortality...|$|R
25|$|A {{risk score}} of four points or higher means {{prophylaxis}} in the ante partum period is needed, {{as well as}} at least six weeks post partum. A previous distal DVT indicates a minimum of 12 weeks (three months) of therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. A previous proximal DVT or pulmonary embolism requires a minimum of 26 weeks (6.5 months) of therapy If the therapy duration reaches delivery time, the remaining duration may be given after delivery, possibly extending the minimum of six weeks of post partum therapy. In a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk,</b> high-dose ante partum prophylaxis should be continued at least 12 weeks after delivery.|$|E
25|$|Screening is not {{recommended}} in women who are at average risk, as evidence does not support a reduction in death and {{the high rate of}} false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks. Those at <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> may have their ovaries removed as a preventive measure. If caught and treated in an early stage, ovarian cancer is often curable. Treatment usually includes some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Outcomes depend on the extent of the disease, the subtype of cancer present, and other medical conditions. The overall five-year survival rate in the United States is 45%. Outcomes are worse in the developing world.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} infections {{of the mouth}} {{include the use of}} {{chlorhexidine}} mouth wash in those with poor immune function and washing out the mouth following the use of inhaled steroids. Little evidence supports probiotics for either prevention or treatment even among those with frequent vaginal infections. For infections of the mouth, treatment with topical clotrimazole or nystatin is usually effective. By mouth or intravenous fluconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B may be used if these do not work. A number of topical antifungal medications may be used for vaginal infections including clotrimazole. In those with widespread disease, an echinocandin such as caspofungin or micafungin is used. A number of weeks of intravenous amphotericin B may be used as an alternative. In certain groups at <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk,</b> antifungal medications may be used preventatively.|$|E

Special Forces medics accompanied many relief flights into the airstrips throughout southern Somalia to assess the area. They were the first U.S. soldiers in Somalia, arriving before U.S. forces who supported the expanded relief operations of Restore Hope. The first teams into Somalia were CIA Special Activities Division paramilitary officers with elements of JSOC. They conducted <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> advanced force operations prior to the entry of the follow on forces.

It is estimated that without protective measures in place, it would be extinct within a decade; and that extinction would be [...] "not only a tragedy in itself but may have unforeseen, and potentially disastrous, consequences for {{the functioning of the}} vegetation communities of which feather-leaved banksia is an integral part." [...] The species has not yet been formally assessed for the IUCN Red List, but warrants a [...] "Critically Endangered (CR)" [...] ranking because populations are projected to decline by more than 80% within the next three generations. It is currently listed as [...] "Endangered" [...] under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and [...] "Rare" [...] under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. These acts provide legislative protection against a range of potential threats, including commercial harvesting of flowers and land clearing. Further statutory protection is afforded by the fact that populations occur within the Eastern Stirling Range Montane Heath and Thicket threatened ecological community, which is listed as [...] "Endangered" [...] under the EPBC Act, and the Montane Mallee Thicket of the Stirling Range threatened ecology community, which has been assessed as [...] "Endangered" [...] by the Western Australian government; and by the presence of northern population within the Stirling Range National Park.|$|E

The study examined 60 patients with prodromal schizophrenia, who were at an estimated risk of 36â54% of developing schizophrenia within a year, and treated half with olanzapine and half with placebo. In this study, patients receiving olanzapine did not have a significantly lower risk of progressing to psychosis. Olanzapine was effective for treating the prodromal symptoms, but was associated with significant weight gain.|$|E

As a matter of fact, {{in the latter case}} an effective control of weed flora is needed in order to maintain a high quality and functionality of the turf. Actually, weed control in turfs is performed by means of <b>very</b> <b>high</b> amount of herbicides.

40|$|Cardiovascular risk can be {{calculated}} using the Framingham cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk score and provides a risk stratification from mild to <b>very</b> <b>high</b> CVD <b>risk</b> percentage over 10 years. This equation represents a complex interaction between age, gender, cholesterol status, blood pressure, diabetes status and smoking. Heart rate variability (HRV) {{is a measure of}} how the autonomic nervous system modulates the heart rate. HRV measures are sensitive to age, gender, disease status such as diabetes and hypertension and processes leading to atherosclerosis. We investigated whether HRV measures are a suitable, simple, noninvasive alternative to differentiate between the four main Framingham associated CVD risk categories. In this study we applied the tone-entropy (T-E) algorithm and complex correlation measure (CCM) for analysis of heart rate variability obtained from 20 minute ECG recordings and correlated the HRV score with the stratification results using the Framingham risk equation. Both entropy and CCM had significant analysis of variance (ANOVA) results (F 172, 3 = 9. 51; < 0. 0001). Bonferroni post hoc analysis indicated a significant difference between mild, <b>high</b> and <b>very</b> <b>high</b> cardiac <b>risk</b> groups applying tone-entropy (p< 0. 01). CCM detected a difference in temporal dynamics of the RR intervals between the mild and <b>very</b> <b>high</b> CVD <b>risk</b> groups (p< 0. 01). Our results indicate a good agreement between the T-E and CCM algorithm and the Framingham CVD risk score, suggesting that this algorithm may be of use for initial screening of cardiovascular risk as it is noninvasive, economical and easy to use in clinical practice...|$|R

Although randomness is a key feature of commercial gambling, when losses outweigh wins and more money is needed, resorting to fraud and theft to finance gambling reflects the <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>risks</b> taken by some gamblers to improve their financial position. Some Indigenous people who may experience a lack of control in living with structural disadvantage (Productivity Commission, 2010) may compound their disadvantage by gambling to reduce social and economic hardship.|$|R
