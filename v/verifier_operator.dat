50|$|The IBM 056 was the {{verifier}} {{companion to}} the 024 Card Punch and 026 Printing Card Punch. The verifier {{was similar to}} the 026 keypunch except for a red error lens in the machine cover lower center. The <b>verifier</b> <b>operator</b> entered exactly the same data as the keypunch operator and the verifier machine then checked to see if the punched data matched. Successfully verified cards had a small notch punched on the right hand edge.|$|E
50|$|The IBM 056 {{verifier}} {{used most}} of the same mechanical and electrical components as the 024/026 keypunches {{with the exception of}} the punch unit and print head. The punch unit had sensing pins in place of the punches. The holes sensed or not sensed would trip a contact bail when the configuration was other than that entered by the <b>verifier</b> <b>operator.</b> This stopped the forward motion of the card, and presented a red error light on the machine cover. The notching mechanism was located in the area occupied by the print mechanism on a 026 printing keypunch. It had a solenoid which drove the notching mechanism, and another that selected the top notch punch or end of card punch.|$|E
5000|$|When an {{operator}} keying {{data to be}} verified encountered an error, the operator was given a second and third try to re-enter the data {{that was supposed to}} be in the field. If the third try was incorrect an error notch was put on the top of the card over the column with the error and the [...] "OK" [...] punch at the end of the card was not enabled. The data on the card could actually be correct, since the <b>verifier</b> <b>operator</b> was just as likely to make an error as the keypunch operator. However, with three tries, the operator was less likely to repeatedly make the same error. Some verifier operators were able to guess the error on the card created by the previous keypunch operator, defeating the purpose of the verify procedure, and thus some machines were altered to allow only one entry and error notched on the second try.|$|E
5000|$|Ironically, not all <b>verifier</b> <b>operators</b> {{appreciated}} the noise reduction. When {{used in a}} room also containing 029 keypunch machines, the <b>verifier</b> <b>operators</b> sometimes missed the auditory feedback provided by the loud [...] "thunk" [...] noise emitted by the older 056. Some were known to compensate by hitting the keys harder, sometimes actually wearing out keyboard parts.|$|R
40|$|Integrated data {{processing}} in offices was studied to determine implicati. ons {{for the development}} of office occupations curriculums in public seCcndary schools and post-higS school institutions offering less than. baccalaureate degrees. Interviews were held with representatives of 285 businesses, teachers in 176 public high and,post-high schools in the cities in 'Aihich the businesses were located, and advanced planning executives of 13 computer manufacturers. Extensive findings include (1) It (appears that jobs will become more complex rather than proliferate, (2) Little change will take place in computers in the next 3 to 10 years. (3) With the relative decrease in use of punched cards as input, the proportion of key punch. and <b>verifier</b> <b>operators</b> will decrease, (4) Advances in software will be extensive in the next 3 to 10 years. and (5) There will be opporivnities for programmers in systems analysis. Recommendations include: (1) inauguration of new programs and updating of existing ones. (2) training of greater numbers of teachers. for the {{data processing}} field, and (3) summer experience in data processing for teachers. Recommended curriculum ยง are included. UK...|$|R
30|$|We {{evaluated}} the discriminative ability of our utterance <b>verifier</b> using Receiver <b>Operator</b> Characteristic (ROC) curves, {{in which the}} two types of error rates, that is, the false-positive and false-negative rates, are plotted for different thresholds. Using the point on the ROC curve where the error rates of both types are equal, the equal error rate (EER), the different confidence indicators and their combinations are evaluated. 95 % confidence intervals were calculated to investigate whether differences between EERs were significantly different.|$|R
40|$|We study three {{variants}} of multi-prover quantum Merlin-Arthur proof systems. We first {{show that the}} class of problems that can be efficiently verified using polynomially many quantum proofs, each of logarithmic-size, is exactly MQA (also known as QCMA), the class of problems which can be efficiently verified via a classical proof and a quantum verifier. We then study the class BellQMA(poly), characterized by a verifier who first applies unentangled, nonadaptive measurements {{to each of the}} polynomially many proofs, followed by an arbitrary but efficient quantum verification circuit on the resulting measurement outcomes. We show that if the number of outcomes per nonadaptive measurement is a polynomially-bounded function, then the expressive power of the proof system is exactly QMA. Finally, we study a class equivalent to QMA(m), denoted SepQMA(m), where the <b>verifier's</b> measurement <b>operator</b> corresponding to outcome "accept" is a fully separable operator across the m quantum proofs. Using cone programming duality, we give an alternate proof of a result of Harrow and Montanaro [FOCS, pp. 633 [...] 642 (2010) ] that shows a perfect parallel repetition theorem for SepQMA(m) for any m.
