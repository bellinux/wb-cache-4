Empirically, our paper tries to expand the original study in both time and space. In time, we are updating developments to the most recent population register data available (2007), but we also go back in urban history to the first modern census held in the Habsburg empire (1869). In terms of geographical coverage, we are adding data on the three largest mononuclear city regions in the Czech Republic, i. e. Prague, Brno and Plzen, to the three largest city regions in Austria, i. e. <b>Vienna,</b> Graz <b>and</b> <b>Linz</b> (these had already been included in the original CURB study) ...|$|R

In Schwarzach-St. Veit, yet another main line, the Tauern Railway, branches off from this line.|$|E
50|$|However, the German forces broke {{under the}} Soviet Red Army counteroffensive and retreated towards Austria to defend Vienna. In April 1945, the 6th SS Panzer Army defended Vienna against the {{advancing}} Soviets, {{but was unable}} to prevent a Soviet conquest of the city. When the war ended on May 8, 1945, the 6th SS Panzer Army was in Austria between <b>Vienna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Linz,</b> in which area it subsequently surrendered to forces of the Soviet and U.S. Armies.|$|E
50|$|By 15 April, {{armies of}} the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front pushed even further into Austria. The {{completely}} exhausted remnants {{of what had}} been the 6th SS Panzer Army were forced to flee to the area between <b>Vienna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Linz.</b> Just behind the retreating Germans were elements of the Soviet 9th Guards Army and the Soviet 46th Army. The 26th Army and 27th Armies advanced towards the area north of Graz just behind the retreating 6th Army. The 57th Army and the Bulgarian 1st Army advanced towards the area south of Graz (near Maribor) just behind the retreating 2nd Panzer Army. None of these German armies was in any shape to do more than temporarily stall the advancing Soviet forces.|$|E

50|$|When he {{completed}} his higher education he settled in Katowice, there he {{taught at the}} city’s Trade High School from 1936 to 1937. Mroszczak {{was one of the}} founders of Katowice’s Free School of Painting and Drawing, where he ran a graphic arts studio in the years 1937-39, at the same time conducting courses at the Institute of Commercial Education in Chorzów. From 1938, he lectured on the theory of advertising at the College of Administration and Social Studies in Katowice. During the German occupation he taught courses on drawing and lettering at the Trade High School in Zakopane and at the Nowy Targ School of Economics. Just after the end of World War II, Mroszczak organized much of the artistic life throughout Silesia, later on he co-founded and assumed the chairmanship of the regional office of the Polish Artists’ Association (ZPAP). From 1947 to 1953 he lectured at the Katowice School of Art, which was later transformed into the Second Faculty of Graphic Art at Cracow’s Academy of Fine Arts. In addition, his skills were employed in designing the Polish coal industry stands at various international fairs. Mroszczak moved to Warsaw in 1952 and obtained the post of creative director at the publishing house Wydawnictwo Artystyczno-Graficzne (1952-56) and a lectureship at the city’s Academy of Fine Arts. He was Chair of Graphic Design from 1957 to 1960, and Dean of the School of Graphic Arts from 1968 to 1971. He became an Associate Professor in 1956 and a Full Professor in 1971. Mroszczak also lectured at numerous foreign universities, such as the Akademie für Bildende Kunst in Berlin-Weissensee (1958) and Hochschule der Künste in West Berlin (1964). In 1963 he lectured at Vienna’s Akademie für Angewandte Kunst, and in 1964 he was invited to give a series of lectures at the Folkwangeschule in Essen, a presentation at the Fachbereich Architektur Technische Universität Darmstadt, and he conducted a seminar at the Hochschule für Gestaltung in Ulm. In 1965 he lectured at the Linz Kunstschule, and in 1966 he participated in a conference for visual communication organized at the German Universität zu Köln. He was invited to conduct a course for graphic designers at the Centre for Creative Enterprise near Moscow in 1968. He lectured at the German Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster and at the Association of Russian Artists in Moscow, and lectured on teaching graphic design in <b>Vienna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Linz</b> in 1974. Mroszczak co-founded the periodical Projekt (Design) and was its editor from 1956 till 1966. He was Vice Chairman of ZPAP’s Chief Artistic Committee, and was co-founder and Chairman of the Warsaw International Poster Biennial Organizational Committee from 1966 to his death in 1975. He was a member of the Committee for Packaging, the Council for Culture and Artistic Higher Education at the Art and Culture Ministry, and the Fine Arts Council. He served as Chairman of the Artistic Committee of the Wilanów Poster Museum, and was both Presidium Member of the Prime Minister’s Council on Industrial Aesthetics and Design, and Chairman of the Fine Arts Section of the State Awards Committee. His interests included poster design, the art of exhibition, and functional graphic design. He designed pavilions at various international expositions and fairs, including Poznań, Paris, Milan, Barcelona, Leipzig, Stockholm, Helsinki, Izmir, Bari, Brussels, and Vienna. He was Chief Designer of the Polish Industry Exhibition in Moscow in 1959; and in 1961 he co-designed the Polish pavilion at the international work safety exposition “Italia ‘61” in Turin. Mroszczak became a member of AGI in 1950 and served as Chairman of the organization’s Polish Section from 1966 to 1974. In 1968-70, he was Vice Chairman of ICOGRADA. He was also an honorary member of the Dutch Graphic Artists Association (GVN) and of the Academia Nazionale de Belli Arte in Parma.|$|E
30|$|Link {{traveling}} time {{models are}} derived {{on the basis}} of an extensive floating taxi data set in Vienna, Austria. The models incorporate typical map information such as speed limits and functional road classification (frc). Estimation is performed using penalized least squares methods to control for overfitting. The expected accuracy for the model transfer is investigated both in terms of intracity transfer (from modelled links to other links in the same city) and in terms of intercity transfer (from one city to another city). Data sets of different extent are used from the two Austrian cities of <b>Vienna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Linz</b> {{as well as for the}} French city of Lyon.|$|E
3000|$|With {{respect to}} parents’ {{education}} levels, the estimates in Model 2 presented in Table  4 verify {{the importance of}} the level of education of the parents as an important determinant of schooling success. At the same time, its magnitude and significance varies across countries. Second-generation Turks are most dependent on their parents’ education backgrounds in Austria, followed by France and then Sweden. Controlling for parents’ education levels further explains the city differences in early school-leaving among second-generation Turks in <b>Vienna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Linz.</b> 4 In France, city differences remain significant even after adjusting the estimates for differences in parents’ education levels and schooling involvement, with the Turkish second generation in Paris still being half as likely to leave school early as their age-mates in Strasbourg. 5 [...]...|$|E

30|$|Out of {{the eight}} {{participating}} countries, Austria, France and Sweden have been selected for comparison. With respect {{to the structure of}} the education system, Austria (<b>Vienna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Linz)</b> and Sweden (Stockholm) have been selected from the pool of available countries. Sweden has a comprehensive education system with late selection and full-day teaching. In contrast, Austria can be described as a country with a non-comprehensive system, early selection and half-day teaching. Finally, France (Strasbourg and Paris) has been selected as a third case for this comparison. Although its education system is comprehensive and resembles the structure of the Swedish system, a number of national studies have revealed that France has high-stakes testing at the end of compulsory education, as well as selectivity across subjects in upper-secondary education, leading to what I call a ‘selective comprehensive system’ (Schnell, 2014), making France an interesting contrasting case.|$|E
3000|$|We {{observe that}} the first two left {{singular}} vectors shown in panel (a) and (b) are quite similar across cities, but one distinct feature of Lyon stands out. These two signals mostly represent the decline of average traveling speed during the day in panel (a) {{as well as the}} morning and evening peak in panel (b), respectively. In particular, the second left singular vector for Lyon reflects the considerable difference in magnitude between the morning and evening peak shown in Fig.  1. In contrast, the two peaks are quite similar for <b>Vienna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Linz,</b> which manifests in the divergence of the three left singular vectors in panel (b) during this time. Panel (c) and (d) reveal considerable differences between the left singular vectors û_ 3 | q, û_ 4 | q across cities; û_ 5 | q, [...]..., û_ 7 | q—not shown—exhibit qualitatively comparable differences across cities q as û_ 3 | q and û_ 4 | q.

30|$|In this paper, we refine {{and extend}} the method {{presented}} in [12] in several respects. Most notably, we provide a more careful modeling of the daily variation patterns by allowing these profiles to differ across road types. Earlier approaches neglect dependence between different time-of-the-day intervals and hence result in noisy daily profiles. This problem becomes more severe when increasing the model complexity by allowing daily profiles to change with road type (as we do). Here, we propose to use penalized least-squares methods, which are already popular in non-parametric (spline-based) estimation. Penalizing the roughness of the daily variation patterns lowers the estimation uncertainty and yields smooth estimated daily profiles. We include details on an efficient numerical implementation of our approach in the Appendix. In addition, we observe that the similarities of the daily profiles across cities concentrate in low dimensional subspaces. We enhance the cross-city prediction approach of [12] to exploit this finding. Using these new developments, we comprehensively {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} a wide range of predictive models with respect to on-site performance (predictive power for the city for which data is available) and cross-city transfer. For the on-site comparisons we use data from the two Austrian cities <b>Vienna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Linz</b> as well as the French city Lyon. The cross-city performance is evaluated for the transfer from Vienna to Linz, Austria, and from Vienna to Lyon, France. The choice of cities here is due to data availability; all methods can be applied without change to other cities/countries as long as adequate data is available.|$|E
50|$|Austria in 2008 had 141 {{district}} courts (Bezirksgerichte) {{with civil}} and criminal jurisdiction. There were also 20 provincial courts (Landesgerichte) with {{civil and criminal}} jurisdiction and four higher provincial courts (Oberlandesgerichte) with criminal jurisdiction, located in <b>Vienna,</b> Graz, Innsbruck, <b>and</b> <b>Linz.</b> The Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof), in Vienna, acts as the final appellate court for criminal and civil cases. The Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) has supreme jurisdiction over constitutional and civil rights issues. The Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) ensures the legal functioning of public administration. A central auditing authority controls financial administration. Judges are appointed {{by the federal government}} and cannot be removed or transferred. Trial by jury was reintroduced in 1951. There is no capital punishment.|$|R
50|$|Apart from {{personal}} reservations {{and differences between}} {{members of the local}} authorities and the federal police, it is not legal in some municipalities to set up community police. In municipalities in which a the federal police {{is at the same time}} the security authority (usually in statutory cities), it is not allowed to establish a municipal police force in accordance with Article 78d (2) Federal Constitution. Thus the frequently expressed political desire of city watches (in German Stadtwache) in <b>Vienna,</b> Graz <b>and</b> <b>Linz</b> is prohibited by the clear regulation of the Federal Constitution. Some cities circumvent this regulation by setting up Code enforcement units (in German: Ordnungsamt, Ordnungswache, Ordnungsdienst) or private security companies. For this reason, the Ordnungsamt Klagenfurt, the Ordnungswache Graz, the Traffic Watch in Vienna or the Order Guards in Wels are not community police forces, but special institutions whose exact design and their powers differ strongly from city to city. The Ordnungsdienst in Linz (Ordnungsdienst der Stadt Linz GmbH) was set up as limited liability company and thus works as a private security service.|$|R
