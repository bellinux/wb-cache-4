Because of its low volatility and very high boiling point (104.8°C at 1atmosphere), methoxyflurane has a low <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.

Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, so it has no melting point.

The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.|$|E
5|$|The {{peculiar}} {{geometry of}} the Uranian system causes the moons' poles to receive more solar energy than their equatorial regions. Because the <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> of CO2 is a steep function of temperature, this {{may lead to the}} accumulation of carbon dioxide in the low-latitude regions of Titania, where it can stably exist on high albedo patches and shaded regions of the surface in the form of ice. During the summer, when the polar temperatures reach as high as 85–90 K, carbon dioxide sublimates and migrates to the opposite pole and to the equatorial regions, giving rise to a type of carbon cycle. The accumulated carbon dioxide ice can be removed from cold traps by magnetospheric particles, which sputter it from the surface. Titania is thought to have lost a significant amount of carbon dioxide since its formation 4.6 billion years ago.|$|E
40|$|The condensation, evaporation, and repartitioning of semivolatile organic {{compounds}} (SVOCs) {{in the atmosphere}} depends both on the phase of condensed material and the effective condensed phase <b>vapor</b> <b>pressures</b> of the SVOCs.

5|$|The {{presence}} of methane and possibly nitrogen suggests that Makemake {{could have a}} transient atmosphere {{similar to that of}} Pluto near its perihelion. Nitrogen, if present, will be the dominant component of it. The existence of an atmosphere also provides a natural explanation for the nitrogen depletion: because the gravity of Makemake is weaker than that of Pluto, Eris and Triton, a large amount of nitrogen was probably lost via atmospheric escape; methane is lighter than nitrogen, but has significantly lower <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> at temperatures prevalent at the surface of Makemake (32–36K), which hinders its escape; the result of this process is a higher relative abundance of methane. However, studies of Pluto's atmosphere by New Horizons suggest that methane, not nitrogen, is the dominant escaping gas, suggesting that the reasons for Makemake's absence of nitrogen may be more complicated.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{physical}} properties of astatine have been estimated (by interpolation or extrapolation), using theoretically or empirically derived methods. For example, halogens get darker with increasing atomic weight– fluorine is nearly colorless, chlorine is yellow-green, bromine is red-brown, and iodine is dark gray/violet. Astatine is sometimes described as probably being a black solid (assuming it follows this trend), or as having a metallic appearance (if it is a metalloid or a metal). The melting and boiling points of astatine are also expected to follow the trend seen in the halogen series, increasing with atomic number. On this basis they {{are estimated to be}} , respectively. Some experimental evidence suggests astatine may have lower melting and boiling points than those implied by the halogen trend. Astatine sublimes less readily than does iodine, having a lower <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure.</b> Even so, half of a given quantity of astatine will vaporize in approximately an hour if put on a clean glass surface at room temperature. The absorption spectrum of astatine in the middle ultraviolet region has lines at 224.401 and 216.225nm, suggestive of 6p to 7s transitions.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium is a hard, silvery, ductile, {{radioactive}} actinide metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide uranium, to the left of the actinide plutonium and below the lanthanide promethium. Neptunium is a hard metal, having a bulk modulus of 118GPa, comparable to that of manganese. Neptunium metal is similar to uranium in terms of physical workability. When exposed to air at normal temperatures, it forms a thin oxide layer. This reaction proceeds more rapidly as the temperature increases. Neptunium has been determined to melt at 639±3°C: this low melting point, a property the metal shares with the neighboring element plutonium (which has melting point 639.4°C), is due to the hybridization of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal. The boiling point of neptunium is not empirically known and the usually given value of 4174°C is extrapolated from the <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> of the element. If accurate, this would give neptunium the largest liquid range of any element (3535K passes between its melting and boiling points).|$|E
40|$|An {{equation}} of state (EoS) suitable for describing associating fluids is presented. The equation combines the simplicity of a cubic {{equation of}} st-ate (the Soave-Redlich-Kwong), which {{is used for the}} physical part and the theoretical background of the perturbation theory employed for the chemical (or association) part.

Excellent correlations of both <b>vapor</b> <b>pressures</b> and saturated liquid volumes are obtained for primary-alcohols (from methanol up to 1 -tridecanol), phenol, tert-butyl alcohol, triethylene glycol, and water.

The estimated pure compound parameters have been tested in the prediction of second virial coefficients with satisfactory results...|$|R

5|$|The largest KBOs, such as Pluto and Quaoar, have {{surfaces}} rich in volatile compounds such as methane, {{nitrogen and}} carbon monoxide; {{the presence of}} these molecules is likely due to their moderate <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> in the 30–50K temperature range of the Kuiper belt.

The relative abundances of these three compounds in the largest KBOs is directly related to their surface gravity and ambient temperature, which determines which they can retain. Water ice has been detected in several KBOs, including members of the Haumea family such as , mid-sized objects such as 38628 Huya and 20000 Varuna, and also on some small objects. The presence of crystalline ice on large and mid-sized objects, including 50000 Quaoar where ammonia hydrate has also been detected, may indicate past tectonic activity aided by melting point lowering due to the presence of ammonia.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{melting point}} of gallium {{allows it to}} melt in the human hand, and then refreeze if removed. The liquid metal has a strong {{tendency}} to supercool below its melting point/freezing point. Seeding with a crystal helps to initiate freezing. Gallium {{is one of the}} four metals (with caesium, rubidium, and mercury) that are known to be liquid at, or near, normal room temperature. Of the four, gallium {{is the only one that}} is neither highly reactive nor highly toxic and can therefore be used in metal-in-glass high-temperature thermometers. It is also notable for having one of the largest liquid ranges for a metal, and for having (unlike mercury) a low <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> at high temperatures. Gallium's boiling point, 2673K, is more than eight times higher than its melting point on the absolute scale, the greatest ratio between melting point and boiling point of any element. Unlike mercury, liquid gallium metal wets glass and skin, along with most other materials (with the exceptions of quartz, graphite, and Teflon), making it mechanically more difficult to handle even though it is substantially less toxic and requires far fewer precautions. Gallium painted onto glass is a brilliant mirror. For this reason as well as the metal contamination and freezing-expansion problems, samples of gallium metal are usually supplied in polyethylene packets within other containers.|$|E
5|$|Trujillo {{and colleagues}} have placed upper limits in Sedna's surface {{composition}} of 60% for methane ice and 70% for water ice. The presence of methane further supports {{the existence of}} tholins on Sedna's surface, because they are produced by irradiation of methane. Barucci and colleagues compared Sedna's spectrum with that of Triton and detected weak absorption bands belonging to methane and nitrogen ices. From these observations, they suggested the following model of the surface: 24% Triton-type tholins, 7% amorphous carbon, 10% nitrogen, 26% methanol, and 33% methane. The detection of methane and water ices was confirmed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared photometry. The presence of nitrogen on the surface suggests the possibility that, {{at least for a}} short time, Sedna may have a tenuous atmosphere. During a 200-year period near perihelion, the maximum temperature on Sedna should exceed , the transition temperature between alpha-phase solid N2 and the beta phase seen on Triton. At 38 K, the N2 <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> would be 14 microbar (1.4 Pa or 0.000014 atm). However, its deep red spectral slope is indicative of high concentrations of organic material on its surface, and its weak methane absorption bands indicate that methane on Sedna's surface is ancient, rather than freshly deposited. This means that Sedna is too cold for methane to evaporate from its surface and then fall back as snow, which happens on Triton and probably on Pluto.|$|E
