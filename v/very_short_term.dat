40|$|The Board of Governors' Regulation A {{currently}} authorizes the Federal Reserve Banks {{to operate}} three main discount window programs: adjustment credit, extended credit, and seasonal credit. On May 17, 2002, the Board published for public comment a proposed amendment to Regulation A that would establish two new discount window programs called primary credit and secondary credit as replacements for adjustment and extended credit. Primary credit {{would be available}} for <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>terms,</b> ordinarily overnight, to depository institutions that are in generally sound financial condition. Secondary credit would be available, subject to Reserve Bank approval and monitoring, for depository institutions that did not qualify for primary credit. The interest rate on primary credit would usually be above short-term market interest rates, including the federal funds rate, {{as opposed to the}} current situation in which the discount rate (the interest rate for adjustment credit) is typically below money market interest rates. Because of the above-market rate, the restrictions currently employed to limit access to adjustment credit will be unnecessary for primary credit. The primary credit program would be broadly similar to mechanisms adopted by many other major central banks to provide credit at the margin at an above-market rate.

40|$|Clinical {{management}} of short bowel syndrome remains a multistage process. Although PN is crucial, early introduction of enteral feeding is mandatory. We describe retrospectively 4 patients with an ultrashort bowel {{who could be}} weaned off PN on <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>terms</b> after introduction of an amino-acid-based formula (Neocate). Patient 1 had congenital short bowel with 50 [*]cm small bowel and 30 [*]cm colon. He had persistent diarrhoea on a semielementary formula. When Neocate was introduced he could be weaned from PN within 6 months. Patient 2 needed multiple surgical interventions because of NEC at D 27. He maintained 40 [*]cm small bowel and an intact colon and remained PN dependent on semielemental formula. After introducing Neocate, PN could be weaned within 3 months. In the next 2 patients, Neocate was introduced as initial enteral feeding after bowel resection following antenatal midgut volvulus. Patient 3 had 20 [*]cm small bowel and an intact colon. PN was weaned after 2 months. Patient 4 had 9 [*]cm small bowel and an intact colon. PN was weaned after 13 months. In all patients Ileocaecal valve (ICV) was preserved. No consensus is reached {{on the type of}} formula to use for short bowel syndrome. Compared to recent data in the literature, the weaning period in these 4 patients was significantly shortened on an aminoacid based formula. The reason for this may lie in the antiallergic properties of this formula. We recommend the use of an amino-acid-based formula to induce earlier weaning of PN...|$|R
