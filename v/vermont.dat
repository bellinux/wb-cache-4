5|$|Allen {{appeared}} before the Continental Congress as early as September 1778 on behalf of <b>Vermont,</b> seeking recognition as an independent state. He reported that due to Vermont's expansion to include border towns from New Hampshire, Congress was reluctant to grant independent statehood to <b>Vermont.</b> Between 1780 and 1783 Allen participated, along with his brother Ira, <b>Vermont</b> Governor Thomas Chittenden, and others, in negotiations with Frederick Haldimand, the governor of Quebec, that were ostensibly about prisoner exchanges, but were really about establishing <b>Vermont</b> as a new British province and gaining military protection for its residents. The negotiations, once details of them were published, were often described by opponents of <b>Vermont</b> statehood as treasonous, but no such formal charges were ever laid against anyone involved.|$|E

In 1907, the US Department of Agriculture established the US Morgan Horse Farm in Weybridge, <b>Vermont</b> on land donated by Battell for the purpose of perpetuating and improving the Morgan breed. The breeding program aimed to produce horses that were sound, sturdy, well-mannered, and capable of performing well either under saddle or in harness. In 1951, the Morgan Horse Farm was transferred from the USDA to the <b>Vermont</b> Agricultural College (now the University of <b>Vermont).</b>|$|E

5|$|Flanders {{was born}} oldest of nine {{children}} in Barnet, {{a town in}} Caledonia County in northeastern <b>Vermont,</b> and {{spent much of his}} childhood in Rhode Island. In his autobiography, Senator from <b>Vermont,</b> Flanders described life on his family’s subsistence farms in <b>Vermont</b> and Rhode Island, before he left to work in the machine tool industry for most of his career. In his first years as a machinist and draftsman, he spent his vacations traveling by bicycle over country roads between Rhode Island and <b>Vermont</b> and New Hampshire. Later, he lived for a time in New York City where he edited a machine tool magazine, but after five years decided to move back to <b>Vermont.</b> In 1911, he married Helen Edith Hartness, daughter of inventor and industrialist James Hartness.

5|$|In 1836, native Vermonter John Deere set {{out from}} Rutland, <b>Vermont</b> to Grand Detour, Illinois, founded by his friend and fellow <b>Vermont</b> native Leonard Andrus. The town lacked a local blacksmith, Deere's trade, and within two days Deere had a forge and new {{business}} established. In <b>Vermont,</b> Deere produced plows made from cast-iron and when he first arrived in Illinois he produced the same plows. Soil conditions in Illinois differ from those in <b>Vermont.</b> In <b>Vermont</b> the soil is sandy and falls easily away from the plow blade but in Illinois the soil is thicker and wetter; it stuck to the plow {{and had to be}} scraped off by the farmer as he plowed.|$|E
