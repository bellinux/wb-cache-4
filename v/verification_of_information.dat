40|$|Abstract Miscommunication or {{omission}} of critical patient information contributes to preventable medical errors {{that result in}} 98, 000 patient deaths each year. The hand-off communication process creates a critical time for the patient as necessary information for the continuity of care must be communicated. The purpose of this practice project was to evaluate the nurses 2 ̆ 7 perception of the current hand-off communication process before and after an educational intervention {{and implementation of the}} I- 5 <b>Verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Tool. Registered nurses were asked to complete a pre survey of their perception of the current hand-off communication process, followed by an educational power point describing the I- 5 <b>Verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Tool. Participants utilized the I- 5 <b>Verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Tool during hand-off over a 3 -week period, and then were asked to complete a post survey to evaluate the nurses 2 ̆ 7 perception of the hand-off process including of the I- 5 <b>Verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Tool. A paired t test was used to determine if there was a difference in the nurses 2 ̆ 7 perception of the current hand-off communication process before and after an educational intervention and implementation of the I- 5 <b>Verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Tool. Although there was no statistically significant difference in the pre- and post-survey scores, post survey results demonstrated clinical significance. This project has implications for positive social change by addressing nurse communication as a method {{to improve the quality of}} hand-off reports, which has the potential to reduce medical errors and improve patient outcomes...|$|E

40|$|We study social {{behaviour}} of agents on capital markets when these are perturbed by small perturbations. We use the mean field method. Social behaviour of agents on capital markets is described: volatility of the market, aversion constant and equilibrium states are discussed. Relaxation behaviour of agents {{on the capital}} market is studied. Equation of motion for the agent average number is of the relaxation type. Development {{of the group of}} agents in the states corresponding to minimum of the aim function is either linear either exponentially damped. There exist characteristic volatility constants V_c 3 and V_c 3. The constant b of <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> contribution to the aversion constant A and the A_ 0 constant of aversion are distinguishing three types of dependencies of the minimum of the aim function on the expected volatility EV and on the expected returns E. Arbitrage trades and group forces lead the group into the equilibrium state. <b>Verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> intensity influences return back to the equilibrium state. The linear in time damping to the equilibrium state is characterized with the characteristic time T_ 3 and T_ 6, the exponential with a characteristic time τ.

Building {{on the concept}} of Place-based Non-Interference, the novelty is that Petri net reachability is employed to detect places in which information leaks occur. We show that the approach is sound and complete, and present its implementation, the Anica tool. Anica employs state of the art modelchecking algorithms to test reachability. An extensive evaluation comprising over 550 industrial process models is carried out and shows that information flow analysis of process models can be done in milliseconds. ...|$|E

40|$|On {{a capital}} market the social group is formed from traders. Individual {{behaviour}} of agents {{is influenced by}} the need to associate with other agents and to obtain the approval of other agents in the group. Making decisions an individual equates own needs with those of the other agents from the group. Any two agents from the group may interact. The interaction consists of the exchange of information and it costs some money. We assume that agents interact {{in such a way that}} they give reference to the origin of the information if asked by other agents. Thus the agent may verify obtained private information. Hudak recently used methods described by Rivier to study social behaviour of such agents. He characterized the quantity which corresponds to <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> Here we study a capital market and social behaviour of agents relations. Quantity which characterizes <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> contributes to an aversion of an agent with respect to a risk. The mix of investments of an agent in a given cell with an average measure A of risk aversion in the cell is found from minimum of the average per cell aim function . Absolute minimum corresponds to such a state in which there is an optimal mix of the exchange of information for a given expectations about the capital market. The crowd and personal /≈ / contributions to the risk aversion of an agent are present in the aversion constant A. We have discussed a stable and metastable states of the market for different values of E, an expected return for a given investment period, of EV, an expected risk for a given investment period, and of b, a constant which characterizes contribution of the quantity to the risk aversion. Characteristics of the variance of n for the distribution of nonreducibile subgroups are found. Our model describes intermediary process effects. 2...|$|E
