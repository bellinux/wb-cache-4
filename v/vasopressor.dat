5|$|Myxedema coma {{or severe}} decompensated {{hypothyroidism}} usually requires {{admission to the}} intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, <b>vasopressor</b> agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low {{to be able to}} safely swallow medication.|$|E
25|$|The {{best known}} feature that {{suggests}} a possible underlying adrenal insufficiency is low blood pressure despite resuscitation with intravenous fluids, requiring <b>vasopressor</b> drugs. These patients typically display tachycardia and {{other signs of}} hyperdynamic shock. Other symptoms include fever, purpura fulminans, and gastrointestinal or neurological disturbances. All these features are relatively non-specific in intensive care patients.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{cardiac output}} and low {{systemic}} vascular resistance {{are characteristic of}} ALF. Pulmonary artery catheterization should be considered. Hypotension should be treated preferentially with fluids, but systemic <b>vasopressor</b> support with agents such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or dopamine should be used if fluid replacement fails to maintain mean arterial pressure of 50–60nbsp&mm Hg. Vasoconstrictive agents (especially vasopressin) should be avoided.|$|E
40|$|Venous {{thromboembolism}} is {{a frequent}} complication in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU), despite prophylactic treatment with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin.

We compared concentrations of factor Xa activity in three groups of 15 patients: Individuals In ICU who had and had not received <b>vasopressors,</b> and general surgery patients. Those who received <b>vasopressors</b> had lower plasma concentrations of factor-Xa activity than patients in ICU not on <b>vasopressors</b> and postoperative controls.

40|$|The {{priority}} {{in the management of}} patients with traumatic hemorrhagic shock is to control the bleeding with simultaneous volume resuscitation to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. Fluid replacement remains the mainstay of initial resuscitation in hemorrhagic shock. Traditionally, <b>vasopressors</b> are contraindicated in the early management of hemorrhagic shock due to their deleterious consequences, although <b>vasopressors</b> may have a role in resuscitation when vasoplegic shock ensues and blood pressure cannot be maintained by fluids alone. Use of <b>vasopressors</b> is not recommended according to the Advanced Trauma Life SupportR management principles. The role of <b>vasopressors</b> remains controversial with no clear guidelines on the timing, type, and dose of these drugs in hemorrhagic shock. Among <b>vasopressors,</b> norepinephrine and vasopressin have been used in the majority of the trials, although not many studies compare the effect of these two on long-term survival in trauma patients. This article reviews the pathophysiology of hemorrhagic shock, adverse effects of fluid resuscitation, and the various experimental and clinical studies on the use of <b>vasopressors</b> in the early phase of resuscitation in hemorrhagic shock...|$|R
25|$|CIRCI can be {{suspected}} {{in patients}} with low blood pressure despite resuscitation with intravenous fluids and <b>vasopressor</b> drugs. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines advocate intravenous hydrocortisone only in adults with septic shock and refractory hypotension. The exact definition of this condition, {{the best ways to}} test for corticoid insufficiency in critically ill patients, and the therapeutic use of (usually low doses) of corticosteroids remains a subject of debate.|$|E
25|$|If low blood {{pressure}} persists despite providing {{a person with}} adequate amounts of intravenous fluid, medications that increase {{blood pressure}} (vasopressors) such as norepinephrine and in certain circumstances medications that improve the heart's ability to pump (known as inotropes) such as dobutamine may be given to improve {{blood flow to the}} kidney. While a useful <b>vasopressor,</b> {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that dopamine is of any specific benefit and may be harmful.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{contraindicated}} or not tolerated, ACE inhibitor (ACE) {{therapy is}} recommended for all patients with systolic heart failure, irrespective of symptomatic severity or blood pressure. ACE inhibitors improve symptoms, decrease mortality and reduce ventricular hypertrophy. Angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy (also referred to as AT1-antagonists or angiotensin receptor blockers), particularly using candesartan, is an acceptable alternative if the patient is unable to tolerate ACEI therapy. ACEIs and ARBs decrease afterload by antagonizing the <b>vasopressor</b> effect of angiotensin, thereby decreasing {{the amount of work}} the heart must perform. It is also believed that angiotensin directly affects cardiac remodeling, and blocking its activity can thereby slow the deterioration of cardiac function.|$|E
30|$|Hospital LOS {{in those}} who didn't require any <b>vasopressors</b> was 4.9 d (3.9 - 6.1), {{in those who}} {{required}} some <b>vasopressors</b> was 5.8 d (5.0 - 7.9), and in those with had vasoplegia was 7.0 d (6.0 - 9.8), p[*]<[*] 0.0001 KWT.|$|R
30|$|Conclusion Development of an {{arterial}} {{high blood}} pressure within 24  h following <b>vasopressors</b> weaning in septic shock is a frequent event. It could be a protective marker regarding mortality at day 30 for patients who survived to <b>vasopressors</b> weaning. Physiopathological substratum of this phenomenon remains uncertain and needs further studies.|$|R

25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in distributive shock are {{to reverse the}} underlying cause and achieve hemodynamic stabilization. Immediate treatment involves fluid resuscitation {{and the use of}} vasoactive drugs, both <b>vasopressors</b> and inotropes. Hydrocortisone is used for patients whose hypotension does not respond to fluid resuscitation and <b>vasopressors.</b> Opening and keeping open the microcirculation is a consideration in the treatment of distributive shock, as a result limiting the use of <b>vasopressors</b> has been suggested. Control of inflammation, vascular function and coagulation to correct pathological differences in blood flow and microvascular shunting has been pointed to as a potentially important adjunct goal in the treatment of distributive shock.|$|R

50|$|Among {{the choices}} for vasopressors, {{norepinephrine}} {{is superior to}} dopamine in septic shock. Norepinephrine is the preferred <b>vasopressor,</b> while epinephrine may be added to norepinephrine when needed. Low-dose vasopressin also {{may be used as}} an addition to norepinephrine, but is not recommended as a first-line treatment. Dopamine may cause rapid heart rate and arrhythmias, and is only recommended in combination with norepinephrine in those with slow heart rate and low risk of arrhythmia. In the initial treatment of low blood pressure in septic shock, the goal of <b>vasopressor</b> treatment is a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mm Hg.|$|E
40|$|<b>Vasopressors</b> are not {{recommended}} by current trauma guidelines, but recent {{reports indicate that}} they are commonly used. We aimed to describe the early hemodynamic management of trauma patients outside densely populated urban centers. We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study in a Canadian regional trauma center. All adult patients treated for traumatic injury in 2013 who died within 24 hours of admission or were transferred to {{the intensive care unit}} were included. A systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, a mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg, the use of <b>vasopressors</b> or ≥ 2 L of intravenous fluids defined hemodynamic instability. Main outcome measures were use of intravenous fluids and <b>vasopressors</b> prior to surgical or endovascular management. Of 111 eligible patients, 63 met our criteria for hemodynamic instability. Of these, 60 (95 %) had sustained blunt injury and 22 (35 %) had concomitant severe traumatic brain injury. The subgroup of patients referred from a primary or secondary hospital (20 of 63, 32 %) had significantly longer transport times (243 vs. 61 min, p< 0. 01). <b>Vasopressors,</b> used in 26 patients (41 %), were independently associated with severe traumatic brain injury (odds ratio 10. 2, 95 % CI 2. 7 - 38. 5). In this cohort, most trauma patients had suffered multiple blunt injuries. Patients were likely to receive <b>vasopressors</b> during the early phase of trauma care, particularly if they exhibited signs of neurologic injury. While these results may be context-specific, determining the risk-benefit trade-offs of fluid resuscitation, <b>vasopressors</b> and permissive hypotension in specific patients subgroups constitutes a priority for trauma research going forwards...|$|R

25|$|In {{adults with}} septic shock and {{refractory}} hypotension despite resuscitation with intravenous fluids and <b>vasopressors,</b> hydrocortisone {{is the preferred}} corticosteroid. It can be divided in several doses or administered as a continuous infusion. Fludrocortisone is optional in CIRCI, and dexamethasone is not recommended. Little evidence is available to judge when and how corticosteroid therapy should be stopped; guidelines recommend tapering corticosteroids when <b>vasopressors</b> are no longer needed.|$|R

Peripheral ischemic insults including color changes occurred in 43 patients (60  %). The median onset time for peripheral ischemia was 3.7 [*]±[*] 4.2  days. Past medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cerebrovascular accidents, and clinical severities such as APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score, SAPS (severity of disease classification system), and SOFA (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment) scores were not significant changes between the ischemic and non-ischemic groups.

40|$|The {{changes in}} renal {{perfusion}} induced by <b>vasopressors</b> {{depend on their}} effects on systemic hemodynamics and renal vascular resistance. Both effects are largely influenced by the patient's underlying condition such as myocardial contractility and vascular responsiveness. A beneficial effect can be expected if mean arterial pressure increases without decreasing cardiac output and if the effect on renal vascular resistance is less pronounced than on systemic vascular resistance. Acute renal failure is associated with loss of renal autoregulation and sepsis is associated with blood pressures below the autoregulatory threshold. Both conditions might therefore benefit from the administration of <b>vasopressors.</b> Many experimental and clinical data indeed suggest a beneficial effect of norepinephrine on the urine output in sepsis. A beneficial effect on renal function (glomerular filtration) is a less consistent finding suggesting that pressure diuresis might be partially responsible for the pressor-induced diuresis.
