This annual event held on November 20 is acknowledged internationally in schools, neighborhoods, and churches.

Data were collected from 90 transgender/transsexual people using confidential, self-administered questionnaires. Factors like age of transition, being out to others, and participant's race and class were associated with experiences of transphobic life events. Discrimination can have profound impact on transgender/transsexual people's lives, but different factors can influence one's experience <b>of</b> <b>transphobia.</b> Further studies are needed to examine how transphobia manifests, and how gender characteristics impact people's lives...|$|R
