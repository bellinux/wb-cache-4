The result was four new vessels that combined the maneuverability of oar-powered galleys with the superior rigs and decent living conditions of sailing ships: the udema, pojama, turuma and hemmema, named after the Finnish regions of Uudeenmaa (Uusimaa), Pohjanmaa, Turunmaa and Hämeenmaa (Tavastia). All four have {{been referred to as}} skärgårdsfregatter, [...] "archipelago frigates", in Swedish and English historical literature, though the smaller udema and pojama are also described as [...] "archipelago corvettes" [...] originally.
