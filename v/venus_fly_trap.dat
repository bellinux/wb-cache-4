50|$|Thigmonasty {{differs from}} thigmotropism in that nastic motion is {{independent}} of {{the direction of the}} stimulus.

50|$|The actual traps {{consist of}} two lobes which fold {{together}} to form a snap-trap {{similar to that of the}} <b>Venus</b> <b>fly</b> <b>trap,</b> except that it is smaller and located underwater. These traps, which are twisted so that the trap openings point outward, are lined on the inside by a fine coating of trigger hairs, snapping shut in response to contact with aquatic invertebrates and trapping them. The closing of this trap takes 10-20 milliseconds, making it one of the fastest examples of plant movement in the kingdom. This trapping is only possible in warm conditions (20 °C). Each trap is surrounded by between four and six 6-8 mm long bristles that prevent triggering of traps by debris in the water.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the next}} year Walker co-produced, {{engineered}} and mixed an album, A Minor Revival (August 2003), for folk rock duo, Sodastream. He also supplied electric and slide guitars, viola and keyboards. Machine Translations released a seven-track extended play, Love on the Vine (late 2003). The title track had backing vocals by Clare Bowditch and Karen Tua, Tua also provided keyboards on another track. The EP {{was followed by a}} studio album, <b>Venus</b> <b>Traps</b> <b>Fly,</b> in May 2004. For Eitelhuber the album was [...] "even more disappointing" [...] than Happy with it being [...] "pleasantly enjoyable in the short term, but repetitive and uninspiring in the long term".

If this monster grows stronger, it turns the victims (including Amy) into plants. Dr. Eng named the plant as [...] "Mimosa Negra" [...] because of the dark color it has. When Tinik-ik is in its true form, it is somewhat resembled The Undead Joker of Masked Rider Blade. Destroyed by Zaido Green in a Time Space Warp battle. Tinik-ik was revived by Le-ar but later killed again by Zaido Green in the final battle.|$|E

40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{movements of}} some carnivorous plants species are triggered by sensory structures derived from trichomes. While unusual plant {{species such as}} the <b>Venus</b> <b>fly</b> <b>trap</b> and sundews {{may be expected to}} have elaborate sensors to capture their insect prey, more modest plant species might not be expected to have similar sensory capabilities. Our recent work, however, has revealed that glandular trichomes on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) appear to have a function similar to trigger hairs of carnivorous species, acting as “early warning” sensors. Using a combination of behavioral, molecular, and biochemical techniques, we determined that caterpillars, moths and mechanical disruption upregulate signaling molecules and defensive genes found in glandular trichomes. Importantly, we discovered that plants whose trichomes have been broken respond more vigorously when their defenses were induced. Taken together, our results suggest that glandular trichomes can act as sensors that detect activity on the leaf surface, and ready plants for herbivore attack...|$|E

40|$|Venus kinase receptors (VKRs) are {{invertebrate}} receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) {{formed by}} an extracellular <b>Venus</b> <b>Fly</b> <b>Trap</b> (VFT) ligand binding domain associated via a transmembrane domain with an intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) domain. Schistosoma mansoni VKRs, SmVKR 1 and SmVKR 2, are both implicated in reproductive {{activities of the}} parasite. In this work, we show that the SH 2 domain-containing protein SmShb is a partner of the phosphorylated form of SmVKR 1. Expression of these proteins in Xenopus oocytes allowed us {{to demonstrate that the}} SH 2 domain of SmShb interacts with the phosphotyrosine residue (pY 979) located in the juxtamembrane region of SmVKR 1. This interaction leads to phosphorylation of SmShb on tyrosines and promotes SmVKR 1 signaling towards the JNK pathway. SmShb transcripts are expressed in all parasite stages and they were found in ovary and testes of adult worms, suggesting a possible colocalization of SmShb and SmVKR 1 proteins. Silencing of SmShb in adult S. mansoni resulted in an accumulation of mature sperm in testes, indicating a possible role of SmShb in gametogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Induced by {{proteins}} {{within the}} cell membrane or by differential growth, heating, or swelling, spontaneous curvatures can drastically affect the morphology of thin bodies and induce mechanical instabilities. Yet, {{the interaction of}} spontaneous curvature and geometric frustration in curved shells remains still poorly understood. Via a combination of precision experiments on elastomeric spherical bilayer shells, simulations, and theory, we show a spontaneous curvature-induced rotational symmetry-breaking {{as well as a}} snapping instability reminiscent of the <b>Venus</b> <b>fly</b> <b>trap</b> closure mechanism. The instabilities and their dependence on geometry are rationalized by reducing the spontaneous curvature to an effective mechanical load. This formulation reveals a combined pressure-like bulk term and a torque-like boundary term, allowing scaling predictions for the instabilities in excellent agreement with experiments and simulations. Moreover, the effective pressure analogy suggests a curvature-induced buckling in closed shells. We determine the critical buckling curvature via a linear stability analysis that accounts for the combination of residual membrane and bending stresses. The prominent role of geometry in our findings suggests the applicability of the results over a wide range of scales. Comment: 13 pages, 8 figures (including Supporting Information...|$|E
40|$|Background: Receptor {{tyrosine}} kinases (RTK) form {{a family}} of transmembrane proteins widely conserved in Metazoa, with key functions in cell-to-cell communication and control of multiple cellular processes. A new family of RTK named Venus Kinase Receptor (VKR) has been described in invertebrates. The VKR receptor possesses a <b>Venus</b> <b>Fly</b> <b>Trap</b> (VFT) extracellular module, a bilobate structure that binds small ligands to induce receptor kinase activity. VKR was shown to be highly expressed in the larval stages and gonads of several invertebrates, suggesting {{that it could have}} functions in development and/or reproduction. Results: Analysis of recent genomic data has allowed us to extend the presence of VKR to five bilaterian phyla (Platyhelminthes, Arthropoda, Annelida, Mollusca, Echinodermata) {{as well as to the}} Cnidaria phylum. The presence of NveVKR in the early-branching metazoan Nematostella vectensis suggested that VKR arose before the bilaterian radiation. Phylogenetic and gene structure analyses showed that the 40 receptors identified in 36 animal species grouped monophyletically, and likely evolved from a common ancestor. Multiple alignments of tyrosine kinase (TK) and VFT domains indicated their important level of conservation in all VKRs identified up to date. We showed that VKRs had inducible activity upon binding of extracellular amino-acids and molecular modeling of the VFT domain confirmed the structure of the conserved amino-acid binding site...|$|E
