40|$|We {{present a}} unique case demonstrating {{contributions}} of the pulvinar in response to visual threat. Substantial evidence demonstrates that the amygdala contributes to the emotion of fear and the response to threat [1, 2, 1, 2]. Traditionally, two routes to amygdala activation have been distinguished: a slow cortical route through <b>visual</b> and <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> and a fast subcortical route through the thalamus [1]. The pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus is well connected to the amygdala [3], suggesting that pulvinar damage might interfere with amygdala activation and response to threat. We tested this possibility in patient SM, who suffered complete loss of the left pulvinar. We measured interference from threatening images on goal-directed behavior. In SMs ipsilesional field, threatening images slowed responses more than pleasant images did. This interference decreased rapidly over time. In contrast, in SMs contralesional field, interference from threatening images was initially absent and then increased rather than decreased over time. Processing through the pulvinar therefore {{plays a significant role}} in generating response to visual threat. We suggest that, with disruption of the subcortical route to the amygdala, briefly presented images were not fully processed for threat. The reemergence of interference over time may reflect contributions of a slower route. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Current {{understanding}} {{posits that}} the different senses interact on multiple stages of processing. We investigated this notion {{using a combination of}} high-resolution fMRI and electrophysiological recordings in non-human primates. In particular we study how acoustic stimulation affects neural responses in low-level (areas V 1 and V 2) and higher-tier visual areas (area TE). In primary visual cortex we find that the presentation of sounds reduces the fMRI-BOLD signal to values below pre-stimulus baseline, but enhances evoked response to visual stimuli above the level attained by pure visual stimulation. This finding is well consistent with previous results in humans, and suggests a modulatory and gain changing mechanism of acoustic stimuli on visual cortex. Noteworthy, the acoustic influence was stronger in peripheral visual representations, in good concordance with prior reports on anatomical projections from auditory areas to peripheral representations in occipital cortex. Similarly, we find that acoustic stimuli modulate neural responses in <b>visual</b> temporal <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> (area TE). Recordings of neural activity in alert animals demonstrate a modulatory influence on neural responses, but only minimal responses to acoustic stimulation alone. Using computational tools to characterize this acoustic influence we find that the presence of sounds enhances the trial to trial reliability of neural responses and increases the ability to correctly decode which of a set of visual scenes was presented. This result hence suggests that sounds increase the encoded visual information...|$|R

For instance, masked semantic priming was only 					observed when the preceding task set required the orientation to semantic word 					features, but not when it required orientation to perceptual word features. 					These results support the view that unconscious automatic processes are 					modulated by top-down factors.

50|$|Prototype theory {{came out}} of {{problems}} with the classical view of conceptual structure. Prototype theory says that concepts specify properties that members of a class tend to possess, rather than must possess. Wittgenstein, Rosch, Mervis, Berlin, Anglin, and Posner {{are a few of}} the key proponents and creators of this theory. Wittgenstein describes the relationship between members of a class as family resemblances. There are not necessarily any necessary conditions for membership, a dog can still be a dog with only three legs. This view is particularly supported by psychological experimental evidence for prototypicality effects. Participants willingly and consistently rate objects in categories like 'vegetable' or 'furniture' as more or less typical of that class. It seems that our categories are fuzzy psychologically, and so this structure has explanatory power. We can judge an item's membership to the referent class of a concept by comparing it to the typical member - the most central member of the concept. If it is similar enough in the relevant ways, it will be cognitively admitted as a member of the relevant class of entities. Rosch suggests that every category is represented by a central exemplar which embodies all or the maximum possible number of features of a given category. According to Lech, Gunturkun, and Suchan explain that categorization involves many areas of the brain, some of these are; <b>visual</b> <b>association</b> areas, prefrontal <b>cortex,</b> basal ganglia, and temporal lobe.|$|R

5000|$|Mental Pattern Processing: A {{fundamental}} question in philosophy and neuroscience is {{why and how}} humans have greatly surpassed other species in their abilities to reason, communicate and engage in abstract thought.

[...] The expansion of the cerebral cortex during human evolution involved mostly brain regions such as the <b>visual</b> <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> and prefrontal cortex that function to rapidly process visual images and make decisions accordingly. Patterns, be they real or imagined, are reinforced by emotional and social experiences, indoctrination and even psychedelic drugs. The abnormal brain function and behaviors that occur in cognitive and psychiatric disorders result from impaired or aberrant pattern processing.

50|$|The {{information}} for color and form comes from P-cells that receive their information mainly from cones, {{so they are}} sensitive to differences in form and color, {{as opposed to the}} M-cells that receive information about motion mainly from rods.

The neurons in the ITC have several unique properties that offer an explanation as to why this area is essential in recognizing patterns.

These receptive fields tend to be larger than those in the striate cortex and often extend across the midline to unite the two visual half fields for the first time. IT neurons are selective for shape and/or color of stimulus and are usually more responsive to complex shapes as opposed to simple ones. A small percentage of them are selective for specific parts of the face. Faces and likely other complex shapes are seemingly coded by a sequence of activity across a group of cells, and IT cells can display both short or long term memory for visual stimuli based on experience.|$|E

Sensitivities to the volatile anesthetics isoflurane and halothane were measured using loss of righting reflex (LORR) and movement in response to tail clamp (TC) as endpoints. Knockdown (KD) of Ndufs 4 in the vestibular nucleus produced resistance to both anesthetics for movement in response to TC.

The first is the regional selectivity within the cerebrum of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) which targets <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> and the primary olfactory cortex alone among regions of primary sensory cortex. The second finding is the clustering of NFT in columns of supra- and infra-granular layers of <b>association</b> <b>cortex.</b> We review recent evidence confirming these findings and comment on their possible significance. We consider that the most attractive hypothesis to explain {{the vulnerability of the}} olfactory system and <b>association</b> <b>cortex</b> is the persistent neural plasticity of these regions. On this basis there would be no need to postulate a progressive spreading process. The columnar distribution of clustered NFT can be well understood in the context of recent concepts of columnar organization of the cerebral cortex. The original interpretation that this distribution of NFT reflects pathology in neurons subserving cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical connections seems to us to have stood the test of time. © 2006 - IOS Press and the authors.
