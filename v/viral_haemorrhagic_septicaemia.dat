Acute <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> was confirmed in beef calves on one small farm, and was suspected on two further nearby holdings with concomitant unexplained losses. The source of the infection could not be determined. Apart from a short duration of depression and loss of appetite, the affected calves developed characteristic distal limb oedema. Gross findings in two calves submitted for laboratory examinations included subcutaneous oedema and haemorrhages on serous membranes, and in one case severe pharyngeal lymph node enlargement was observed. Histological examinations revealed lesions characteristic of septicaemia. Moderate to large amounts of Pasteurella antigens were detected in all organs tested by immunohistochemistry. Two isolates of P. multocida (Pm 240, Pm 241) were cultured from these cases and examined in detail. These were identified as P. multocida ssp. multocida biovar 3. Both were toxA negative and belonged to serotype B: 2.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the efficacy of hypertonic saline solution (HSS) along with antibiotic (ceftiofur HCl) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (ketoprofen) in the treatment of <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> in buffaloes. For this purpose, 50 buffaloes suffering from <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> were randomly divided in two equal groups A and B. Group A served as control and was treated with ceftiofur HCl (IM) and ketoprofen (IV) @ 6 and 2 mg/Kg BW, respectively, for five days. Buffaloes of group B were administered with rapid intravenous infusion of hypertonic saline solution (7. 5 % NaCl) @ 4 ml/Kg BW once in combination with ceftiofur HCl and ketoprofen. Animals were monitored for 24 hours after initiation of treatment. Clinical parameters, serum electrolytes, plasma volume and survival index were recorded at different intervals after treatment. Survival rate (80 %) in group B was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than 48 % in group A. The heart rate and respiration rate recovered more effectively in the buffaloes administered with treatment protocol B. Plasma volume was 98 % which was almost normal within 24 hours after the infusion of hypertonic saline solution to the animals of group B.

While our preparations of the IHN, SVC, SBi and PFD viruses showed typical rhabdovirus morphology with bullet-shaped particles and distinct surface projections, the VHS virus preparations had a less typical rhabdovirus morphology but were pleomorphic with a preponderance of flexuous rods. Using virus labelled with [~H]-uridine, it was shown that each virus contained RNA which sedimented at 38 to 4 ° S and was hydrolysed by very low concentrations of ribonuclease. The viruses of SVC, PFD and SBI had a polypeptide composition {{similar to that of}} vesicular stomatitis virus, the prototype rhabdovirus, but the IHN and VHS viruses gave a pattern similar to that of rabies virus.

40|$|Abstract: The recent {{demonstration}} that reared turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L) {{is a natural}} host for salmonid rhabdoviruses has made their rapid detection relevant to these fish species. A unique protocol to select and use non-competitive monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) for two high-sensitivity sandwich ELISAs has been developed to detect both infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) and <b>viral</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> virus (VHSV) in turbot kidney extracts to assess {{the possibility of using}} them in field diagnosis. For maximum sensitivity, turbot kidney extracts can be two-fold diluted with high-ionic strength buffers and assayed for the presence of the major viral proteins (VMS rhabdovirus nucleoprotein N/Nx and/or IPN birnavirus protein VP 3). The use of control plates coated with irrelevant mouse antibodies (IgG 1 and IgG 2 a) in parallel ELISAs allows for a precise estimation of possible false positives.

The development of a recombinant subunit vaccine was initiated to produce a safe and effective vaccine to protect fish against VHS.

In the present study, a genome scan to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting resistance and survival to <b>viral</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> (VHS) was carried out. Three full-sib families with approximately 90 individuals each were genotyped and evaluated by linear regression and maximum likelihood approaches.

Several genomic regions controlling resistance and survival time to VHS were detected. Also significant associations between the evaluated traits and genotypes at particular markers were identified, explaining up to 14 % of the phenotypic variance. Several genomic regions controlling general and specific resistance to different diseases in turbot were detected.

The official surveillance programme was often unable to find VHSV-positive populations, leading to the misbelief in the fish farming industry that virus eradication could be achieved.

One programme involved syndromic surveillance based on the observation of clinical disease signs by fish farmers, while 2 programmes comprised active surveillance similar to the official programme, but included increased sampling frequencies and 2 additional tests. The syndromic surveillance concentrated on sending in samples for analysis when any sign of a possible infectious disease at water temperatures below 15 °C was noticed. This programme clearly outperformed active surveillance. A realtime reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method proved to be at least as sensitive as virus isolation in cell culture in detecting acute VHSV infections.
