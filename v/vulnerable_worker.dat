40|$|The Traumatic Injury Prevention Pro- gram aims {{to reduce}} the {{incidence}} of physical trauma in the workplace, whether it is caused by unintentional injury or by violence. This snapshot highlights our recent accomplish- ments and some upcoming work. What are our priorities? The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Traumatic Injury Prevention Pro-gram works with partners from industry, labor, trade associations, professional organizations, and academia. The program addresses these areas: 1. Decreasing the leading causes of work-related injuries. 2. Decreasing work-related injuries among high-risk occupations and <b>vulnerable</b> <b>worker</b> groups. What do we do? 1. Conduct research to develop an evidence base for: a. Preventing falls at work, and protecting workers from injury when falls happen. b. Preventing motor vehicle-related injuries, and protecting workers from injury during motor vehicle incidents. c. Preventing workplace violence by evaluating measures designed to reduce such violence, and making recommendations to reduce risk factors. d. Identifying and evaluating ways to reduce traumatic injuries among high-risk occupations and <b>vulnerable</b> <b>worker</b> groups, and making recommendations to reduce risk factors. These groups may include fire fighters; law enforcement officers; workers in construction, transportation, healthcare and fishing industries; young workers; older workers; racial/ethnic minorities; and others. 2. Share research findings and evidence-based recommendations with partners who can put the information into practice. These partners include manufacturers, consensus standard committees, employers, workers, and government agencies. 3. Conduct effective surveillance for occupational injuries, and share data with the re-search community, employers, and workers to guide future research and prevention efforts. What have we accomplished? 1. Released upgraded version of the award-winning NIOSH Ladder Safety smartphone app, which has been downloaded more than 50, 000 times. 2. Adoption of ambulance test methods by the General Services Administration's (GSA) purchase specifications for ambulances, and the National Fire Prevention Association standard. These test methods were developed by NIOSH and partners to improve ambulance crashworthiness. 3. Nearly 15, 000 healthcare personnel completed a free online workplace violence training course between August 2013 and December 2015. The course was developed by NIOSH and partners. 4. Published contemporary anthropometry (body size and dimensions) data for fire fighters and truck drivers on the NIOSH website, and encouraged use of these data in equipment and workspace design (e. g. fire fighter gloves, truck cabs). 5. Raised awareness of an upward trend in suicides in the workplace through analysis of surveillance data. 6. A manufacturer used NIOSH research to create an innovative personal flotation device for commercial fishermen that is comfortable enough to be worn continuously on deck while still providing flotation protection. It won an industry safety award, and more than 2, 000 units were sold in the first year. What's next? 1. Release a web-based simulator that will allow users to test and view the stability of aerial lifts under different worksite conditions, such as high winds and uneven ground. 2. Release a NIOSH Fact Sheet with recommendations to improve the safety of older drivers in the workplace. 3. Complete analyses evaluating workplace violence prevention interventions. 4. Publish findings on research into the underreporting of occupational injuries and its implications. NIOSHTIC No 2004815...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{impact of}} global warming on {{population}} health {{is a growing concern}} and has been widely discussed. The issue of heat stress disorders and consequent productivity reduction among workers has not yet been widely addressed. Taiwan is an island straddling the Tropic of Cancer in the West Pacific and has both subtropical and tropical climates. As of 2008, the economy of Taiwan accounts for 1. 1 % of the world gross domestic product at purchasing power parity and is listed as 19 th in the world and eighth in Asia, according to International Monetary Fund data. Objective: The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify occupations at risk and the potential health impacts of heat on workers in Taiwan. Design: Historical data relating to meteorology, population, the labour force and economy were obtained from publicly available databases from the Taiwanese government. Results: Hot seasons with an average maximum temperature above 308 C and relative humidity above 74 %, lasting for four to six months from May to October, pose health threats to construction, farming and fishery workers. In particular, populations of ageing farmers and physically overloaded construction workers are the two most <b>vulnerable</b> <b>worker</b> categories in which high temperature impacts on health and productivity. Conclusions: Currently, regulations and preventive actions for heat relief are difficult to enforce for several reasons, including lack of equipment for measuring environmental conditions, lack of awareness of potential hazards and strict time constraints imposed on workers. There is an urgent need to systematically and comprehensively assess the impact of a warming climate on workers ’ health and productivity to provide effective prevention strategies for a better working and living environment in Taiwan...|$|E
30|$|Another {{frequently}} proposed policy {{solution is}} the deregulation of permanent contracts. This solution definitively has some value {{since it would}} remove the labor market rigidity {{that leads to a}} visibly unfair distribution of job security and market risks and limits transition possibilities to permanent jobs. Under such a regime, permanent contracts would be less permanent, although the reliance on temporary contracts would also decline. Hence, a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>worker</b> would not be less vulnerable if his or her temporary contract is replaced with a flexible ‘permanent’ employment contract, although the chance of being hired (and eventually dismissed) on a permanent contract would be higher. However, if deregulation does not go far enough, incentives to hire on temporary contracts remain. Member states will thus have {{to try to find a}} moderate level of EPL that balances both goals, whereby recent EPL reforms can be interpreted as steps in this direction. Similar reservations can be formulated for the frequently proposed ‘single-employment contract’. Here, the idea is to replace temporary and permanent contracts with a unified legal framework in which dismissal protection is phased-in with tenure. However, the problem is that such a framework produces thresholds in dismissal costs below that employers’ prefer to replace a worker with a new one whose protection starts from zero. This effectively means that newly recruited workers still face the same insecurity, at least for some time. In addition, if thresholds are implicit and employer-specific, workers do not even know how long they can stay with the firm and when they make a transition into secure employment. Depending on how the single-employment contract is modelled, it is quite possible that it makes the situation of workers with short tenure even more precarious than it would be on a temporary contract. Finally, in the real-world situation, it is difficult to imagine an arrangement without any option to have temporary contracts under certain conditions, meaning that some duality will remain.|$|E
40|$|The Global Plan of Action for Workers' Health was {{endorsed}} in May 2007 as Resolution 60. 26 by the 193 WHO {{member states}} at the 60 th World Health Assembly. The Global Plan of Action {{is based on the}} earlier WHO Global Strategy on Occupational Health for All, prepared in 1994 by the collaborating center network directors. The global strategy was used to develop a proposal to the 1996 World Health Assembly, which was endorsed as WHA Resolution 49. 12 of 1996. The 2007 Global Plan of Action for Workers' Health provides a policy framework for renewed and intensive action to protect, promote and improve the health of all workers, with the goal of preventing occupational health risks and hazards. Its structure is the five objectives listed above. The resolution addresses all aspects of workers' health, including primary prevention of occupational hazards, protecting and promoting health at work, and improving the response of health systems to workers' health. It calls for traditional methods to assess and manage occupational risk in the workplace, which is a key area for action. It also calls for improving workers' health by involving other public health disciplines, such as chemical safety, environmental health, health systems, and disease prevention and control. It urges close collaboration with labor and other sectors, and all relevant stakeholders. Partners in many projects include the WHO occupational health staff in Geneva and in the six WHO Regional Offices, collaborating centers, institutions working toward designation as collaborating centers, nongovernmental organizations, country ministries, and international organizations of employers and workers. The Network of WHO Collaborating Centres for Occupational Health helps WHO to provide assistance to countries. The network has been carrying out national, regional, and global projects to help countries implement their commitments to the Workers' Health: Global Plan of Action. The first of two recent common workplans was the 2009 - 2012 workplan, which enabled WHO to report accomplishments to the World Health Assembly in 2013. This booklet reports on the activities and successes of the 2009 - 2012 workplan and the 2012 - 2017 Global Master Plan, which is currently underway. Examples of successes are described in the following pages. The collaborating center projects in both workplans are examples of successes and are organized into five groups, each focused on one of the five Objectives of the Global Plan of Action for Workers' Health. The progress of projects was coordinated by volunteer managers from some of the collaborating centers, and by WHO staff in Geneva and in the Regional Offices. LOOKING FORWARD: The collaborating centers, nongovernmental organizations, and WHO staff in headquarters and the Regional Offices are actively moving forward within the Global Master Plan 2012 - 2017. Projects in this new plan continue to help WHO to produce products and assist countries meet their commitments in the WHO Global Plan of Action on Workers' Health (2008 - 2017) : Resolution 60. 26. A particular emphasis in both workplans has been to assist low resource countries and to share the practical tools, with new users implementing them and evaluating them.

40|$|Major {{technological}} {{advances in the}} last few years have increased our knowledge of the role that genetics has in occupational diseases and our understanding of genetic components and the interaction between genetics and environmental factors. The use of genetic information, along with all of the other factors that contribute to occupational morbidity and mortality, will play an increasing role in preventing occupational disease. However, the use of genetic information in occupational safety and health research and practice presents both promise and concerns [McCanlies et al. 2003; Kelada et al. 2003; Henry et al. 2002; Christiani et al. 2001; Schulte et al. 1999]. Use of genetic information raises medical, ethical, legal and social issues [Clayton 2003; Ward et al., 2002; McCunney 2002; Christiani et al 2001; Rothstein 2000 a; Schulte et al. 1999; Lemmens 1997; Barrett et al. 1997, Van Damme et al. 1995; Gochfeld 1998; Omenn 1982]. The purpose of this report is to bring together the diverse literature and opinions on genetics in the workplace, to highlight important issues, and to provide some considerations for current and future practice. Occupational safety and health professionals and practitioners may have particular interest in this report as the understanding of gene-environment interactions at the mechanistic and population levels may result in improved prevention and control strategies. This report is divided into topic areas for ease of reading. Specifically, the role of genetic information in occupational disease is discussed in Chapter 2, followed in Chapter 3 by a presentation of how genetics is incorporated into occupational health research. Health records as a source of genetic information are discussed in Chapter 4. The report continues in Chapter 5 with a focus on genetic monitoring, followed in Chapter 6 by a theoretical discussion of genetic screening. The final chapter presents an overview of the most important aspects of this report, which are the ethical, social, and legal implications of genetics in the workplace. In addition, ethical issues specific to health records and genetic testing are discussed in Chapters 4 and 6, respectively. To assist our audience in finding additional sources of information or more in-depth discussion of the issues surrounding genetic information, a list of web sites is provided at the conclusion of this document. Role of Genetic Information in Occupational Disease: The role of genetic information in occupational disease is being explored. The framework for considering genetics in the exposure to disease paradigm arose from a National Academy of Sciences review on biomarkers [NRC 1987]. Biomarkers are measurements using biological tissues that give information about exposure, effect of exposure, or susceptibility. Evaluation of genetic damage can provide information about exposure or effect of exposure. However, the presence of a specific genetic biomarker will not itself result in an occupational disease; exposure to a workplace hazard is necessary. The presence of a disease risk biomarker in the absence of exposure may be innocuous. The study of biomarkers of genetic susceptibility in the context of workplace exposures can provide information about gene-environment interactions. One major emphasis of genetic research in occupational disease has been in the area of response variability. Extensive variability in the human response to workplace exposures has been observed. Genes can have multiple variations known as polymorphisms, which may contribute to some of this variability [Grassman et al. 1998]. Research has been conducted over the last approximately 30 years to identify the role of genetic polymorphisms in a wide range of occupational and environmental diseases, particularly those involving occupational carcinogens [Hornig 1988; Berg 1979]. The risk of biological effects or diseases attributable to an occupational exposure can be decreased, unchanged, or increased among individuals with certain genetic polymorphisms. Incorporating Genetics into Occupational Health Research: The main influence on genetic research with respect to occupational health is the large number of {{technological advances}} in molecular biology. Because of these new techniques, it is now feasible to evaluate the relationship of disease with individual genes and their variants or even with the whole genome. These technologies promise to set the stage for new discoveries in understanding mechanisms and the preclinical changes that might serve as early warnings of disease or increased risk [NRC 2007]. "(Cont'd) "They also present difficult challenges in terms of handling large data sets, understanding the normal range, standardizing technologies for comparison and interpretation, and communicating results [King and Sinha 2001; Wittes and Friedman 1999]. As our understanding of the role of specific genes and their variants increases, genetic tests are being developed to look at specific genotypes. One critical issue in genetics is the validity of such genetic tests. Much contemporary genetic research involves the collection of biological specimens (usually DNA in white blood cells) that are then tested either for changes (damage) to genetic material or for genetic polymorphisms. These genetic tests, while useful in occupational health research, are not ready for clinical use; in other words, they are not validated for clinical interpretation. Validation is a process by which a test's performance is measured both in the laboratory and in populations, resulting in the evaluation of the clinical utility or the risks and benefits of the test. Until clinically validated, the information from such tests may be meaningless with regard to an individual's health or risk. In contrast, genetic tests may be validated for assessing exposure or effect modification in research even if they have no clinical utility. Health Records: A Source of Genetic Information: Genetic tests are not the only source of genetic information in the workplace. Genetic information is kept in workers' personnel and workplace health records [Rothenberg et al. 1997]. This information is in the family history of diseases with known strong genetic etiologies as well as in the results of physical examinations and common laboratory tests. This type of information is reported routinely by workers or obtained by employers from workers' job applications, health questionnaires, health and life insurance applications, physicals, and workers' compensation proceedings [Anderlik and Rothstein 2001]. The line between what is and is not genetic information in health records is unclear. States have enacted legislation with widely varying definitions of what constitutes genetic information from an employee's health record. Questions concerning confidentiality, privacy and security remain as the handling of health records may be influenced by various federal and state regulations. Genetic Monitoring and Occupational Research and Health Practice: Genetic information can be a scientific tool to understand mechanisms and pathways in laboratory research and as independent or dependent variables in population research studies of workers. In occupational safety and health practice, genetic tests may be used in a variety of ways. As in other areas of health science, genetic information may be used in the differential diagnosis of disease, allowing clinicians to consider or exclude various diagnoses. Monitoring for the effects of exposure on genetic material, such as chromosomes, genes, and constituent deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), has been used to evaluate risks and potential health problems for more than 50 years, particularly those from ionizing radiation [Mendelsohn 1995; Langlois et al. 1987; Berg 1979]. Such monitoring is not unlike monitoring for metals in blood, solvents in breath, or dusts in lungs and presents less ethical concern than assessing heritable effects [Schulte and DeBord 2000]. Tests for genetic damage have been advocated as a way to prioritize exposed individuals for more thorough medical monitoring [Albertini 2001]. Genetic monitoring highlights the confusion that exists between individual and group risk assessment. Unlike other monitoring methods, the risks linked to cytogenetic changes are interpretable only for a group, not for an individual [Schulte 2007; Murray 1983; Lappe 1983]. Currently, no U. S. regulations exist that mandate genetic monitoring. Questions arise whether genetic monitoring indicates a potential health problem, an existing health problem, or compensable damage. More research is needed to understand the science before the individual's risk of disease can be interpreted from genetic monitoring results. However, genetic monitoring to determine exposure may be useful for the occupational health practitioner Theoretical Use of Genetic Screening and Occupational Health Practice: Genetic monitoring may have some application in occupational health practice, but perhaps the most controversial use of genetic information would be in making decisions about employment opportunities and health and life insurance coverage [Schill 2000; Bingham 1998; Van Damme et al. 1995; Murray 1983; Lappe 1983]. This would occur primarily as a result of genetic screening, in which a job (and insurance) applicant or a current worker might be asked to undergo genetic testing to determine if he or she has a certain genotype. However, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits discrimination on the basis of genetic information with respect to health insurance and employment [U. S. Congress 2008]. Genetic screening which was not strictly prohibited by the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) is now prohibited. Under ADA an employer may not make medical inquiries about an applicant until a conditional offer has been extended. Once the offer has been tendered, an employer could have obtained medical, including genetic, information about a job applicant. ADA did not prohibit obtaining genetic information or genetic screening, nor did it prohibit an employer from requesting genetic testing once an applicant has been hired provided the testing is job related. and can be used for the purposes of job placement after a conditional job offer is made. Most criteria for genetic screening programs indicate that participation should be voluntary, with informed consent in place. Genetic screening for these purposes cannot be supported at this time because of the current lack of linkage of causation of a given genetic polymorphism with a given occupational disease and its implications with regard to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act of 1970) that the workplace be safe for all workers [OSHA 1980 b]. Accurate genetic screening information may eventually be useful to workers considering employment options. Obtaining this information for the worker would become appropriate only after the screening tests have been validated regarding risk. Various ethical arguments have been advanced in the discussion of genetic screening, and a broad range of implications of genetic testing has been discussed in the literature and in this document, including the oversight of genetic testing laboratories. The Ethical, Social, and Legal Implications of Genetics in the Workplace: A concern about the use of genetic information in occupational safety and health is that the emphasis in maintaining a safe and healthful workplace could shift from controlling the environment to excluding the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>worker.</b> This would be counter to the spirit and the letter of the OSH Act of 1970 [OSHA 1980 b]. Actions that attempt to depart from providing safe and healthful workplaces for all should not be supported. Nevertheless, understanding the role of genetic factors in occupational morbidity, mortality, and injury is important and could lead to further prevention and control efforts. However, occupational safety and health decision-makers, researchers, and practitioners may find that genetic factors do not contribute substantially to some occupational diseases. Environmental risk factors will probably always be more important for developing strategies for prevention and intervention in occupational disease and ultimately for the reduction of morbidity and mortality. The challenge is to identify and apply genetic information in ways that will improve occupational safety and health for workers. The use of genetic information in occupational safety and health research requires careful attention because of the real or perceived opportunities for the misuse of genetic information. Society in general and workers in particular have concerns that discrimination and lack of opportunity will result from the inappropriate use of genetic information [MacDonald and Williams-Jones 2002; Maltby 2000]. While only sparse or anecdotal information supports this contention, a wide range of workers, legislators, scientists, and public health researchers have concern that such discrimination could occur. Thus, GINA and other regulations were passed to prevent the potential misuse and abuse of genetic information in the workplace. Examples of safeguards include rules and practices for maintaining privacy and confidentiality, prohibition of discrimination, and support of a worker's right of self-determination (autonomy) with regard to genetic information. Many of these safeguards have been built into biomedical research in general, and occupational safety and health research in particular, through guidance given in the Nuremberg Code [1949], the Belmont Report [1979], and the Common Rule (45 CFR. 46) [DHHS 2005; CFR 2007], as well as in the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) reports [1999], the ADA [1990], Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) [1996] and GINA in 2008 [U. S. Congress 2008]. ADA and HIPAA provided some safeguards against the potential misuse of genetic information in the workplace before GINA was signed and in 2000, Executive Order 13145 was signed that prohibits discrimination in federal employment based on genetic information [65 Fed. Reg. 6877 (2000) ]. In summary, the use of genetic information in the workplace has the potential to affect every worker in the United States.

40|$|As {{the descent}} from {{the heights of}} our most recent rights {{revolution}} continues apace, there is a cautionary lesson contained {{in the aftermath of}} the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment and the abolition of chattel slavery, 150 years ago next year. Reconstruction was the moment when the promise of universal liberty to work first became part of the American state’s covenant with its people. But this promise was quickly lost, and the rights that the federal government had extended to the freed slaves – the freedmen – were contested and eventually nullified by vehement opposition in the working fields and cities of the South. In this sense, workers’ rights were the original civil rights, and the Freedmen’s Bureau, the original federal labor rights agency, was a founding failure of enforcement. This article argues that enforcement efforts today must take from this history an increased focus on the labor standards of low-wage workers, in particular the unauthorized immigrants among them. The presence of a largely unauthorized workforce in a labor market, such as in day labor and domestic work, is a reliable sign that the most <b>vulnerable</b> <b>workers</b> may be found there. By focusing on these most <b>vulnerable</b> <b>workers,</b> government enforcement efforts can help overcome the collective action problem that is created by any system of minimum labor standards.

30|$|Both the {{government}} and the public recognize three subpopulations in China as being particularly vulnerable with respect to employment. These are migrant workers, college graduates, and urban <b>vulnerable</b> <b>workers</b> who are relatively old and poorly educated, who suffer from unemployment or difficulty of finding jobs from time to time. By taking a closer look at each of these groups, one can begin to understand better the new challenges China is facing in this transition toward a neoclassical labor market.|$|R

It analyses a case where a category of workers dismissed by established national unions as impossible to organize came to form their own women's movement and thence their own union. The case highlights the crucial role of a sustained, flexible approach towards organizing at the micro level, in the mobilization of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>workers</b> employed in highly competitive labour markets...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about how recessions impact the labor market {{earnings}} of specific groups of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>workers,</b> especially low-educated workers and minorities. Focusing on the recessions of 1990 - 1991 and 2001, this study seeks to identify the extent of earnings losses associated with recessions, and the extent and speed at which the earnings of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>workers</b> recovered following recessions, both in absolute terms and relative to more advantaged comparison groups. It utilizes the Census Bureau’s Gold Standard restricted-use dataset, which links observations from the 1990 - 2004 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) with labor market earnings and benefits receipt data from the Social Security Administration. These data allows for the tracking of annual labor market earnings before, during, and after a recession. Results support previous evidence that the earnings of men are subject to more volatility in the years surrounding recessions than those of women. Education level {{appears to be a}} key factor associated with differences in recession-period earnings. High-educated workers, on the whole, experienced sustained earning growth across recessions and recovery years. Low-educated workers, in contrast, generally saw large declines in annual earnings associated with th...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} this special issue volume on vulnerable work and strategies for inclusion. Definitions, measurement, analysis and policy responses to vulnerable work and strategies for inclusion are addressed before the key aspects of the nine papers included in the special issue are summarised. Design/methodology/approach - The topic of vulnerability at work is explored, before the distinguishing features of jobs that generate vulnerable conditions and the characteristics of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>workers</b> are identified. Findings - Vulnerable work is insecure and irregular with few protections accorded to the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>workers</b> who are often characterised by their age, ethnic status, gender and skill profiles. The consequences include: poor job quality, low and irregular incomes and personal/family hardship. Vulnerability is widespread across the workforce, with workers subject to work intensification, employment insecurity and poor work-life balance. Social implications - <b>Vulnerable</b> work and <b>workers</b> constitute a growing and global phenomenon. Consequently, governments and employers need to work together on programmes, such as the ILO&# 039;s decent work agenda, to ensure that basic human rights at work are widely recognised and provision to ongoing employment, safe working conditions and regular hours are offered across a variety of industries/sectors. Originality/value - This volume examines the conceptual, empirical and policy aspects of vulnerability in employment. It documents the international dimensions of vulnerability, the different forms it takes, those groups that are at risk of vulnerable employment and the underlying factors that generate and support vulnerability...|$|R
25|$|Minimum {{wages are}} used widely in {{developing}} countries to protect <b>vulnerable</b> <b>workers,</b> reduce wage inequality, and lift the working poor out of poverty. The political popularity of minimum wages stems {{in part from the}} fact that the policy offers a means for redistributing income without having to increase government spending or establish formal transfer mechanisms. The challenge to policymakers is to find that wage level that is considered fair given workers' needs and the cost of living, but does not harm employment or a country's global competitiveness.|$|R
30|$|Most {{countries}} protect <b>vulnerable</b> <b>workers</b> through {{labor market}} institutions, including minimum wages. 1 However, just because labor laws exist {{does not guarantee}} compliance, especially when doing so is costly and their enforcement weak (Ronconi 2010). Therefore, researchers frequently encounter that employers are paying wages below mandated minima. Existing estimates report that 16 – 50 % of developing country workers earn sub-minimum wages (Rani et al. 2013). Moreover, this non-compliance tends to be heterogeneous within countries, depending on institutional factors, industry-specific attributes, location, and worker characteristics.|$|R
