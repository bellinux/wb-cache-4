40|$|A {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} was used in a petrographic investigation of the matrix textures of 41 lunar breccias ranging from <b>very</b> <b>friable</b> <b>soil</b> clods through coherent microbreccias and tough vitric breccias to tough, fine-grained crystalline breccias. It was found that as their coherence increases, the matrices display a gradual increase {{in the content of}} glass from 1 or 2 % as filaments less than 1 micron across through 5 - 50 % as irregularly shaped patches up to 200 microns across to over 50 % as continuous networks...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} and {{particle size}} distribution of three different soils Alfisols, Inceptisols and Entisols in the Gubi Soil Series, Bauchi were studied. The investigation revealed that the soils were generally deep and sandy in texture although the Entisol contains more silt than the sand fraction. Both the Afisols and Inceptisols had transitional horizons between the A and B horizons and also contain kandic (k) horizons. The topsoil colours in the Alfisols and Inceptisols were dominantly dark brown while the subsoils were yellowish to yellowish brown. The Entisols had dark yellowish brown to dark gray colour at the surface and light gray to olive brown in the subsoil. Soil structure was weak coarse subangular blocky for the Inceptisols and Alfisos (except for one profile in the Alfisol which together with the Entisols was structureless. Soil consistence was moist and friable or moist and <b>very</b> <b>friable</b> across <b>soil</b> types. There was evidence of organism (roots) in all the profile with plenty iron concretions and calcium nodules. A proper management of these soils will require additions of organic matter and fertilization with inorganic fertilizers for optimum crop production...|$|R
30|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of the recharge rate {{is the result of}} the effect of several different parameters, including the lithology, slope gradient, rock fracturing, land use and soil type. The lithology directly affects the permeability of the rocks and therefore the rate of infiltration. The geology varies in the three basins (Dauteloup 1958; Piqué et al. 2007). The Rheraya basin has a low permeability compared with the rest of the region and consists of continental Permo–Triassic sandstone formations, marly limestone continental facies of Senonian age, and multiple ferromagnesian rocky outcrops that are almost impermeable. The part of the Ourika basin in the study area is composed of middle Eocene and continental Miocene formations dominated by early-to-middle Quaternary and modern formations, all highly permeable. To the north, up to 80  m of breccia conglomerate promotes infiltration. In addition, the <b>very</b> <b>friable</b> brown <b>soils,</b> which cover almost the entire basin, promote recharge. Apart from its lithological and soil characteristics, lineaments correspond to fault zones and fractures with secondary porosity and high permeability. These lineaments are very important as they promote the passage of water towards the aquifer. Finally, the existence of NE–SW-oriented fractures downstream of the Ourika basin favour recharge as they are perpendicular to the flow of rainwater running from the High Atlas to the adjacent sub-basins.|$|R

40|$|Genesis, {{classification}} {{and agricultural}} potentials of the soils derived from Kerrikerri sandstone formation in Bauchi State, Nigeria were investigated. Field and laboratory observations with the soils from five pedons, one each at crest, lower slope and valley floor, and two from middle slope positions, revealed {{that they were}} deep (> 150 cm), brown (7. 5 YR 5 / 3) to very pale brown (10 YR 7 / 3) and sandy loam to sandy clay loam in the upper horizon underlain by yellowish red (5 RY 4 / 8) to brownish yellow (10 YR 6 / 8) and gravely sand clay to clay horizons, with moderately well-developed sub-angular blocky structure and <b>friable</b> to <b>very</b> <b>friable</b> consistence. The <b>soils</b> were strongly to moderately acidic (pH. 5. 1 - 5. 9 in H 2 O, 3. 8 - 5. 3 in CaCl 2), low in exchangeable bases (1. 04 – 1. 40 cmol (+) kg- 1 as well as exchange acidity (0. 54 - 1. 90 cmol (+) kg – 1) with cation exchange capacity ranging between 4. 4 and 27. 6 cmol (+) kg- 1 soil. The dominant pedogenic processes influencing the rate of soil development {{were found to be}} clay lessivation, colluvial-fluvial deposition and neoformation of minerals in the lower horizons as a result of downward leaching of the bases and likely better moisture condition at depth. The soils were classified according to the USDA Soil Taxonomy System (2003) /FAO-UNESCO Soil Map of the World Legend (1988) as Pedon 1 (Crest) : Aquic Haplustult fine loamy, isomesic/Gleyic Acrisol, Pedons 2, 3 and 4 (Middle slopes 1 and 2 as well as Lower slope) : Orthic Paleustults fine loamy kaolinitic, isohyperthermic/Orthic Acrisol, and Pedon 5 (Valley floor) : Aquic Plinthic Haplustaults clayey, isohyperthermic/ Plinthic Acrisol...|$|R

5000|$|When digging new burrows, {{the mole}} will push excess soil up through {{vertical}} shafts called [...] "molehills". New burrows {{just below the}} surface are marked by ridges and molehills, and such burrows appear to be used to facilitate the capture of earthworms and other soil life after a rain. In building burrows and probably at other times, the mole uses its nose as a tactile organ, poking about here and there. In <b>friable</b> <b>soil,</b> the species can burrow at a rate of 6 m/h.|$|R
5000|$|The hoop hoe, {{also known}} as the [...] "action hoe", oscillating, hula, stirrup, {{pendulum}} weeder, or [...] "swivel hoe") has a double-edge blade that bends around to form a rectangle attached to the shaft. Weeds are cut just {{below the surface of the}} soil as the blade is pushed and pulled. The back and forth motion is highly effective at cutting weeds in loose or <b>friable</b> <b>soil.</b> The width of the blade typically ranges between 3-7 inches. The head is a loop of flat, sharpened strap metal. However, it is not as efficient as a draw hoe for moving soil.|$|R

50|$|The Michoacan {{pocket gopher}} is endemic to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt {{mountain}} range in central southern Mexico, where {{it occurs in}} four discrete locations near west of Lake Pátzcuaro at altitudes over 2200 m. The fossil record shows {{that members of the}} genus Zygogeomys, including two other now extinct species, were widespread in the late Pliocene epoch in the southwestern United States. Its typical habitat is mixed forests of spruce, pine, and alder with deep <b>friable</b> <b>soil</b> suitable for burrowing. A number of small populations separated by unsuitable terrain exist. The species shows little genetic variation and the present population may be a relict of a previous, more widespread distribution.|$|R
50|$|The {{plasticity}} of {{the soil}} {{is a measure of}} its ability to deform without shearing and is to some extent a function of water content. Plastic soils tend to stick to screens and other equipment, and agglomerate into large clumps. In addition to slowing down the feed rate, plastic soils are difficult to treat. Heating plastic soils requires higher temperatures because of the low surface area to volume ratio and increased moisture content. Also, because plastic soils tend to be very fine-grained, organic compounds tend to be tightly sorbed. Thermal treatment of highly plastic soils requires pretreatment, such as shredding or blending with more <b>friable</b> <b>soils</b> or other amendments (e.g. gypsum).|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} nocturnal and shows maximum {{activity}} levels shortly after sunset. It {{is three times}} less active on nights with a moon than on moonless nights; it is more active in the open on nights without a moon, while keeping {{in the shade of}} vegetation when the moon is shining. It feeds largely on seeds which it stuffs into its cheek pouches for transporting back to the burrow to eat or to cache. It chooses <b>friable</b> <b>soil</b> for the digging of the burrow. Breeding may take place three times a year, with litters of up to five young, and the gestation period is about one month.|$|R
50|$|Laumontite easily dehydrates when {{stored in}} a low {{humidity}} environment. When freshly collected, if it has not already {{been exposed to the}} environment, it can be translucent or transparent. Over a period of hours to days the loss of water turns it opaque white. In the past, this variety has been called leonhardite, though this is not a valid mineral species. The dehydrated laumontite is <b>very</b> <b>friable,</b> often falling into a powder at the slightest touch.|$|R
50|$|The {{variation}} of wave propagation direction {{can be achieved}} by either cutting three samples at 0°, 45° and 90° from the cores or by using one core plug with transducers attached at these three angles. Since most shales are <b>very</b> <b>friable</b> and fissured, {{it is often difficult to}} cut shale core plug. Its edges break off easily. Thus the cutting sample method can only be used for hard, competent rocks. The cutting position of samples can be explained by the following diagram.|$|R

50|$|The {{woodland}} vole lives throughout the eastern United States, ranging {{as far as}} Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. They inhabit deciduous forests, dry fields, and apple orchards. Voles prefer wooded areas with high vertical vegetative stratification but also evergreen shrubs, ground cover, and old fallen logs. Deciduous forests with moist, <b>friable</b> <b>soils</b> are suitable for burrowing and voles are most abundant in these habitats. However, {{they can also be}} found in other habitats from dry fields to the edges of coastal bays. In addition, apple orchards are a favorite habitat. The root systems of trees are an important food source for vole and thus tree spacing affects the density of vole populations.|$|R
30|$|One {{factor that}} {{does not seem to}} be {{strongly}} correlated with bump proneness is the character of the coal. Iannacchione and Zelanko (1995) noted that bursts have occurred in at least 25 different US coalbeds, varying from strong, blocky seams to <b>very</b> <b>friable</b> ones like the Pocahontas No. 3 and No. 4. Extensive German laboratory studies using large-scale specimens have also concluded that nearly all bituminous coals can burst. In these experiments, coal seams ranging in unconfined, compressive strength from 5  MPa to 50  MPa have all been shown to be burst-prone (Bräuner 1994).|$|R
30|$|The major ginger {{growing area}} in Ethiopia {{includes}} wetter regions at altitude below 2000  m in Kefa, Illubabur, Gamo Gofa, Sidama, Wellega, Wolaita, and Kembata-Tambaro. Currently, {{it has become}} an important cash crop for farmers in southern and south-western parts of Ethiopia. The production of this spice has been expanding {{in most parts of the}} country, as it can be grown under varied climatic conditions. It thrives well in areas with altitudes from sea level to 1500  m, mean annual temperature of 20 – 32 °C and with total rainfall greater than 1200  mm. Well-drained, fertile and <b>friable</b> <b>soil</b> with enough humus and neutral pH is the ideal soil type for the production of ginger (Asfaw and Demissew 2009; Hailemicheal et al. 2008).|$|R
5000|$|Most herbs {{prefer a}} well drained, <b>friable</b> <b>soil.</b> This allows the roots {{to receive the}} water they need without the danger of rot and {{promotes}} a strong root system. [...] There {{are a variety of}} soil amendments to be added if the soil in a specific area is not desirable for to promote good herb growth. For outdoor herb farming the soil must be prepared ahead of time by removing vegetation and analyzing soil for pH value and amount of fertilizer needed for proper growing conditions. In commercial industries, additional soil sterilization is used to eliminate common soil derived crop diseases, pests, and for the control of weeds. Additionally, crop rotation is important to diminish the possibility of common crop diseases.|$|R
