40|$|This {{article will}} analyse the {{contemporary}} co-existence of standard non-parole periods and judicial guideline judgments in New South Wales. In R <b>v</b> <b>Way,</b> judicial {{interpretation of the}} standard non-parole provisions circumscribed their direct application. Subsequently, in cases such as R v Davies, R v AJP, R v Sangalang and R v Mills, the Court of Criminal Appeal has grappled with {{the meaning of the}} standard non-parole period as a "reference point" in sentencing and has expressed a view that the practical effect of these reference points will be to increase sentence levels for certain offence categories. Alongside this scheme stand judicial guidelines judgments; the most recent promulgated in 2004 for the summary offence of driving within the high-range prescribed concentration of alcohol. With the concurrent operation of these two different forms of "guidance" for the exercise of judicial sentencing discretion, important questions have arisen in relation to enduring issues about sentencing in a context encompassing the potential for increasingly prescriptive statutory accretions. Will standard non-parole periods and judicial guideline judgments continue to provide moderate mechanisms for guidance to sentencers, or will the heightened emphasis on transparency and consistency in sentencing lead to more rigid regulation? What are the indicators for the future as to the extent and form of the guidance or regulation...|$|E

50|$|Language is {{relevant}} to psychoanalysis in two key respects. First, it is important {{with respect to the}} therapeutic process, serving as the principal means by which unconscious mental processes are given expression through the verbal exchange between analyst and patient (e.g., free association, dream analysis, transference-countertransference dynamics). Secondly, psychoanalytic theory is linked in many ways to linguistic phenomena, such as parapraxes and the telling of jokes. According to Freud (1915, 1923), the essential difference between modes of thought characterized by primary (irrational, governed by the id) as opposed to secondary (logical, governed by the ego and external reality) thought processes is one of preverbal <b>vs.</b> verbal <b>ways</b> of conceptualizing the world.|$|R

The internal granular layer (IV) is sufficiently wide and dense to separate clearly sublayer IIIb from layer V. The boundary between layers V and VI {{is defined by}} larger ganglion cells, more pyramidal in shape, in layer <b>V</b> giving <b>way</b> to smaller, more spindle-shaped cells that become denser and more homogeneous deeper in layer VI.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} literature on the implementation of e-health to identify: (i) barriers and facilitators to e-health implementation, and (ii) outstanding gaps in research on the subject. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PSYCINFO and the Cochrane Library were searched for reviews published between 1 January 1995 and 17 March 2009. Studies had to be systematic reviews, narrative reviews, qualitative metasyntheses or meta-ethnographies of e-health implementation. Abstracts and papers were double screened and data were extracted on country of origin; e-health domain; publication date; aims and methods; databases searched; inclusion and exclusion criteria and number of papers included. Data were analysed qualitatively using normalization process theory as an explanatory coding framework. FINDINGS: Inclusion criteria were met by 37 papers; 20 had been published between 1995 and 2007 and 17 between 2008 and 2009. Methodological quality was poor: 19 papers did not specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria and 13 did not indicate the precise number of articles screened. The use of normalization process theory as a conceptual framework revealed that relatively little attention was paid to: (i) work directed at making sense of e-health systems, specifying their purposes and benefits, establishing their value to users and planning their implementation; (ii) factors promoting or inhibiting engagement and participation; (iii) effects on roles and responsibilities; (iv) risk management, and (<b>v)</b> <b>ways</b> in which implementation processes might be reconfigured by user-produced knowledge. CONCLUSION: The published literature focused on organizational issues, neglecting the wider social framework that must be considered when introducing new technologies. <br/...|$|R
