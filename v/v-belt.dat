25|$|Benchtop table saws, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} job-site saws, are lightweight and {{are designed to}} be placed on a table or other support for operation. They commonly have direct drive (no <b>v-belt</b> or pulleys) from a universal motor. They can be lifted by one person and carried to the job location. These saws often have parts made of steel, aluminum and plastic and {{are designed to be}} compact and light.|$|E
25|$|At Earls Court, London, in 1976, Batavus {{showed the}} seven-model range; six {{machines}} were {{powered by the}} 48cc Laura engine, with <b>V-belt</b> primary drive and automatic clutch. The exception was the top-of-the-range Mk 4S, with motorcycle styling and the Sachs four-speed motor. Specification include an electronic tachometer, battery-operated turn signals and heavy-duty suspension front and rear. This model, which has the overall dimensions of a full-sized motorcycle was the biggest machine sold by Batavus.|$|E
25|$|Hybrid {{table saws}} are {{designed}} {{to compete in the}} market with high-end contractor table saws. They offer some of the advantages of cabinet saws at a lower price than traditional cabinet saws. Hybrid saws on the market today offer an enclosed cabinet to help improve dust collection. The cabinet can either be similar to a cabinet saw with a full enclosure from the table top to the floor or a shorter cabinet on legs. Some hybrid saws have cabinet-mounted trunnions and some have table-mounted trunnions. In general, cabinet-mounted trunnions are easier to adjust than table-mounted trunnions. Hybrid saws tend to be heavier than contractor saws and lighter than cabinet saws. Some hybrid saws offer a sliding table as an option to improve cross cutting capability. Hybrid saw drive mechanisms vary more than contractor saws and cabinet saws. Drive mechanisms can be a single <b>v-belt,</b> a serpentine belt or multiple v-belts. Hybrid saws have a 1.5 or 2hp motor and thus the ability to run on a standard 15 or 20 amp 120 volt American household circuit, while a cabinet saw's 3hp or larger motor requires a 240 volt supply.|$|E

50|$|Disadvantages {{include a}} {{relatively}} high purchase cost, the need for specially fabricated toothed pulleys, less protection from overloading, jamming, and vibration due to their continuous tension cords, the lack of clutch action (only possible with friction-drive belts), and the fixed lengths, which do not allow length adjustment (unlike link <b>V-belts</b> or chains).|$|R

50|$|Power is {{transmitted}} from the engine to the drive system through drive belts. Originally, the R22 used four separate <b>v-belts</b> running on multi-groove sheaves. This system proved problematic, as individual belts would sometimes roll over in their groove and fail. As a temporary measure, in 1982, R22 operators received a kit from Robinson that was installed in the cockpit and on the belt tension actuator, isolating the tensioning circuits and locking the clutch/drive system at take-off tension. The problem was ultimately solved by replacing the four individual <b>v-belts</b> with two dual <b>v-belts.</b> The upper, driven sheave is mounted on the main/tail rotor drive shaft incorporating flexible couplings, and is raised and lowered relative to the engine-mounted, driving sheave {{by means of a}} belt tension actuator. During shutdown, the actuator is used to lower the upper sheave to loosen the drive belts. For startup, the engine is started with the belts loose, allowing the engine to run without spinning the rotor system. Immediately after engine start, the clutch switch located in the cockpit is closed by the pilot, powering the actuator to slowly raise the upper sheave to flight position, which tightens the belts. The actuator is thereafter controlled by pressure-sensing column springs, automatically maintaining proper belt tension during flight as the belts wear and stretch. The shaft on which the upper sheave is mounted drives both the main and tail rotors; the main gear box delivers power to the main rotor shaft through a set of splash-lubricated spiral bevel gears.|$|R
50|$|A further {{advantage}} of the polygroove belt that makes them popular {{is that they can}} run over pulleys on the ungrooved back of the belt. Though this is sometimes done with <b>V-belts</b> with a single idler pulley for tensioning, a polygroove belt may be wrapped around a pulley on its back tightly enough to change its direction, or even to provide a light driving force.|$|R

50|$|The {{definite}} ratio that teeth give gears {{provides an}} advantage over other drives (such as traction drives and <b>V-belts)</b> in precision machines such as watches that depend upon an exact velocity ratio. In cases where driver and follower are proximal, gears also have {{an advantage over}} other drives in the reduced number of parts required; {{the downside is that}} gears are more expensive to manufacture and their lubrication requirements may impose a higher operating cost per hour.|$|R
5000|$|It is more {{efficient}} than the older multiple belt system and may consume less space in the engine compartment. By using a single, wider belt instead of multiple, thinner belts, the belt may be put under increased tension without stretching. Higher tension reduces slip, which increases belt life and mechanical efficiency. Reduced slip can allow the use of lower-ratio pulleys; this reduces the load on the engine, increasing fuel economy and available power. The tendency for <b>V-belts</b> to [...] "flip over" [...] in the pulley groove (at high RPM and/or when the belt stretches) is eliminated, and a serpentine belt is also much easier to maintain and replace, {{since there is no}} need to remove multiple belts in order to replace one of them, although newer adjustable-length <b>V-belts</b> ("link belts") can be put on without having to remove other belts, and their link design also allows a self-tensioning characteristic to reduce the risk of flipping over. Also since only one movable belt tensioner is required all of the peripheral components (alternator, A/C compressor, etc.) can simply be mounted to the engine without the need to swivel.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} main {{parameters}} like power, torque, speed, slip and temperature influencing power transmission and belt life. The specimen chosen are common narrow <b>V-belts</b> existing of a Chloroprene matrix.

5000|$|The engine, {{called the}} Gurgel Enertron, was {{developed}} by Gurgel themselves. This is a water-cooled gasoline engine with two opposed piston cylinders. Essentially a halved VW boxer-four engine, it was developed with either 650 cc or 800 cc displacements, generating [...] and [...] respectively. It had a very simple and robust design, eliminating totally the <b>V-belt</b> by using the crankshaft for activating the alternator, and the camshaft for water and oil pump. In a later stage of development, the <b>V-belt</b> was reintroduced for the alternator, so that the battery would be charged even at low engine speeds.|$|E
50|$|The scooter weighs around 93 kg, Fuel {{capacity}} is 7 liters and oil capacity (two-stroke oil) is 1.2 liters. Its automatic dry centrifugal clutch {{is driven by}} <b>V-belt.</b> Engine compression ratio is 6:1.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{made from}} bolted-together aluminum tubing, with the tailboom built from carbon fibre. Its 6.10 m diameter two-bladed rotor has a chord of 20 cm, with anti-torque handled by a conventional two-bladed tail rotor. The main rotor transmission uses a combination of <b>V-belts</b> and toothed belts. Pitch link controls are mounted inside the hollow rotor mast tube. The aircraft has an empty weight of 193 kg and a gross weight of 386 kg, giving a useful load of 193 kg. With full fuel of 58.8 L the payload is 151 kg.|$|R
50|$|Any <b>V-belt's</b> {{ability to}} drive pulleys depends on {{wrapping}} the belt around a sufficient {{angle of the}} pulley to provide grip. Where a single-V-belt {{is limited to a}} simple convex shape, it can adequately wrap at most three or possibly four pulleys, so can drive at most three accessories. Where more must be driven, such as for modern cars with power steering and air conditioning, multiple belts are required. As the polygroove belt can be bent into concave paths by external idlers, it can wrap any number of driven pulleys, limited only by the power capacity of the belt.|$|R
50|$|The Duocar was {{described}} at the 1912 Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show, with a JAP 8 hp V-twin providing the power, with fan assisted cooling. A large diameter external flywheel was fitted {{to smooth the}} engine which was fed by a Lukin carburettor operated by an accelerator pedal. The steering had a cable and worm drive. It used Hans Renold chain drive to the countershaft, and the drive to the rear wheels was by 1.125inch armoured <b>V-belts.</b> Gearing was provided by expanding pulleys to the back axle, with the back axle moving to ensure no slack in the drive belts.|$|R
50|$|In {{this most}} common CVT system, {{there are two}} <b>V-belt</b> pulleys that are split {{perpendicular}} to their axes of rotation, with a <b>V-belt</b> running between them. The gear ratio is changed by moving the two sheaves of one pulley closer together and the two sheaves of the other pulley farther apart. The V-shaped {{cross section of the}} belt causes it to ride higher on one pulley and lower on the other. This changes the effective diameters of both pulleys, which changes the overall gear ratio. As the distance between the pulleys and the length of the belt does not change both pulleys must be adjusted (one bigger, the other smaller) simultaneously {{in order to maintain the}} proper amount of tension on the belt. Simple CVTs combining a centrifugal drive pulley with a spring loaded driven pulley often use belt tension to effect the conforming adjustments in the driven pulley. The <b>V-belt</b> needs to be very stiff in the pulley's axial direction in order to make only short radial movements while sliding in and out of the pulleys.|$|E
5000|$|For {{high-power}} requirements, {{two or more}} V-belts can {{be joined}} side-by-side in an arrangement called a multi-V, running on matching multi-groove sheaves. This {{is known as a}} multiple-V-belt drive (or sometimes a [...] "classical <b>V-belt</b> drive").|$|E
50|$|The Staib Helicopter is a {{powered by}} a Continental C85 with a <b>V-belt</b> linkage. The gearbox is sourced from a Ford Model A, the clutch from a Studebaker, the rotors cut down from a Brantly B-2 and cooling system from a Chevrolet Corvair. Four {{different}} rotor heads were tested.|$|E
50|$|The open {{belt drive}} has {{parallel}} shafts rotating {{in the same}} direction, whereas the cross-belt drive also bears parallel shafts but rotate in opposite direction. The former is far more common, and the latter not appropriate for timing and standard <b>V-belts</b> {{unless there is a}} twist between each pulley so that the pulleys only contact the same belt surface. Nonparallel shafts can be connected if the belt's center line is aligned with the center plane of the pulley. Industrial belts are usually reinforced rubber but sometimes leather types, non-leather non-reinforced belts, can only be used in light applications.|$|R

The Blackhawk is capable of being applied as a secondary or tertiary crusher {{as well as a}} pebble crusher.The Blackhawk 100 is driven directly via a flexible coupling to the electric drive motor. This arrangement eliminates the need for sheaves and <b>v-belts,</b> allowing for simplified operation and maintenance.

50|$|The {{first car}} of 1912 {{was a small}} {{two-seater}} bullnosed cyclecar and had a 1,099 cc twin-cylinder or 1,074 cc four-cylinder engine made by Alpha of Coventry driving the rear wheels via a three-speed-and-reverse gearbox and a countershaft from which two <b>V-belts</b> went to the rear wheels. The engine could be started from the driving seat using a mechanical linkage. The channel section steel chassis was placed under the axles with suspension by semi-elliptic leaf springs. This arrangement allowed the car to have a low, sporting appearance. In 1914 the option of a larger four-cylinder version was added. A new model was announced in 1916 with 1330 cc four-cylinder engine, but few if any reached the public before car production ceased later that year.|$|R
