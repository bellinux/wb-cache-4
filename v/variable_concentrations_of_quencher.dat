The quenching of benzophenone in the first singlet excited state at high <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>quencher</b> and the very rapid decay of the resulting singlet geminate ion pair are confirmed.

40|$|A {{continuous}} distribution approach, {{instead of the}} traditional mono- and multiexponential analysis, for determining quencher concentration in a heterogeneous system has been developed. A mathematical model of phosphorescence decay inside a volume with homogeneous <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> phosphor and heterogeneous <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>quencher</b> was formulated to obtain pulse-response fitting functions for four different distributions <b>of</b> <b>quencher</b> concentration: rectangular, normal (Gaussian), gamma, and multimodal. The analysis was applied to parameter estimates of a heterogeneous distribution of oxygen tension (PO 2) within a volume. Simulated phosphorescence decay data were randomly generated for different distributions and heterogeneity of PO 2 inside the excitation/emission volume, consisting of 200 domains, and then fit with equations developed for the four models. Analysis using a monoexponential fit yielded a systematic error (underestimate) in mean PO 2 that increased with the degree of heterogeneity. The fitting procedures based on the {{continuous distribution}} approach returned more accurate values for parameters of the generated PO 2 distribution than did the monoexponential fit. The parameters of the fit (M = mean; sigma = standard deviation) were investigated {{as a function of}} signal-to-noise ratio (SNR = maximum signal amplitude/peak-to-peak noise). The best-fit parameter values were stable when SNR > or = 20. All four fitting models returned accurate values of M and sigma for different PO 2 distributions. The ability of our procedures to resolve two different heterogeneous compartments was also demonstrated using a bimodal fitting model. An approximate scheme was formulated to allow calculation of the first moments of a spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>quencher</b> without specifying the distribution. In addition, a procedure for the recovery of a histogram, representing the quencher concentration distribution, was developed and successfully tested...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a simple, reliable method for determination of detergent micelle aggregation number that relies solely on measurement of steady-state fluorescence quenching is presented. The degree of steady-state fluorescence quenching of a micelle-solubilized fluorophore (pyrene) by a quencher that partitions greatly into the micelles (coumarin 153) {{is dependent on the}} micelle concentration, which can therefore be determined. The aggregation number is calculated as the micelle concentration/detergent monomer concentration (the total detergent concentration above the critical micelle concentration). For the determination to be accurate, the partition coefficient <b>of</b> the <b>quencher</b> into the micelle phase is determined and used to calculate the micellar <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>quencher.</b> Also, the quenching of pyrene by a coumarin 153 molecule within the same micelle must be complete, and this was confirmed by time-resolved fluorescence measurements. Aggregation numbers were determined for one cationic and several nonionic detergents and were found to be consistent with literature values. The approach presented is an improvement on a previous luminescence quenching technique (Turro, N. J., and A. Yekta. 1978. J. Am. Chem.

40|$|Differences in {{sensitivity}} toward toxicants between {{young and}} adult individuals {{in a population}} {{are assumed to be}} primarily associated with their difference in body size. This assumption {{plays a key role in}} the modeling <b>of</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>variable</b> <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> toxicants on nonhomogeneous populations. The hazardbased no-effect-concentrations (NECs), killing rates, and elimination rates, estimated from the survival data of a series of acute toxicity tests with young and adults of Daphnia magna and six alkylphenols, were used to evaluate this assumption. The results lead to the conclusion that young and adult D. magna were equally sensitive in terms of NEC and killing rate and that the observed differences in elimination rates could be explained on the basis of a difference in body size. Furthermore, it was found that elimination rates estimated on the basis of the survival data were consistently smaller than those expected on the basis of a QSAR for Daphnia pulex, a comparable species. This discrepancy was likely due to a decreased uptake and elimination during a period of immobilization prior to death. Since it is unknown to what extent immobilized individuals are able to recover from short-term exposures, the observed deviation clearly identifies a complicating factor in the modeling <b>of</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>variable</b> <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> toxicants...|$|R

Heavy metals are associated with mineral phases such as pyrite, iron and manganese oxyhydroxides, organic matter and clay minerals, and correlations are varied. Using a multi-disciplinary approach and geochemical comparisons {{it has been shown}} that the Kellaways Sand is particularly enriched in Cr. Cr concentration data suggest two separate components, one bound with Ni and MnO, and the other occurring as an accessory resistate phase Fe–Ti–Cr oxide (ulvöspinel) with up to 4. 7 wt% Cr 2 O 3. The closest correlations between matrices are Zn and Ni with Fe 2 O 3; V, Ni, Rb and Ga with MnO, MgO and K 2 O; Ni and MnO with TOC; and Cd with Zn.

40|$|Two-photon excitation, time-resolved {{fluorescence}} microscopy {{was used to}} investigate the fluorescence quenching mechanisms in aggregates of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b pigment protein complexes of photosystem II from green plants (LHCII). Time-gated microscopy images show the presence of large heterogeneity in fluorescence lifetimes not only for different LHCII aggregates, but also within a single aggregate. Thus, the fluorescence decay traces obtained from macroscopic measurements reflect an average over a large distribution of local fluorescence kinetics. This opens the possibility to resolve spatially different structural/functional units in chloroplasts and other heterogeneous photosynthetic systems in vivo, and gives the opportunity to investigate individually the excited states dynamics of each unit. We show that the lifetime distribution is sensitive to the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>quenchers</b> contained in the system. Triplets, which are generated at high pulse repetition rates of excitation (> 1 MHz), preferentially quench domains with initially shorter fluorescence lifetimes. This proves our previous prediction from singlet-singlet annihilation investigations (Barzda, V., V. Gulbinas, R. Kananavicius, V. Cervinskas, H. van Amerongen, R. van Grondelle, and L.
