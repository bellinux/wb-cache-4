5|$|Even {{though the}} <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> {{had won a}} clear victory over the regular units of the South Vietnamese army, they did not get away with light casualties. After the battle, a {{combined}} total of 126 <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> bodies were recovered within the Special Forces compound and the district headquarters, and several hundred more were strewn all over the battlefield. Indeed, individual <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> soldiers usually spare no efforts to evacuate their dead or wounded comrades; but as military operations were conducted during the rainy season, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> struggled to evacuate all their casualties from the battlefield as conditions on the main roads deteriorated. Despite the minor setbacks, the Đồng Xoài campaign marked the rapid maturity of the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 9th Division as a fighting force. For their efforts during the battle, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 272nd Regiment received the title of 'Đồng Xoài Regiment' to mark their achievements.|$|E
5|$|Ap Bac had {{far-reaching}} {{consequences for}} the South Vietnamese government and the American involvement in Vietnam. The battle was a milestone for the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong.</b> For individual <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> soldiers, the battle demonstrated they could defeat nominally superior ARVN forces, well equipped as they were with up-to-date military hardware and significant support and funding from the United States. Militarily, the morale and confidence of <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> commanders and soldiers, who had experienced serious setbacks in the previous year, were greatly boosted. Politically, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 261st and 514th Battalions were able to exploit the prestige gained from having inflicted disproportionate losses on the ARVN forces to exercise greater influence in their areas of operations.|$|E
5|$|At 7 am on 7 April, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> massed {{for another}} ground assault {{from the north}} and west of Lộc Ninh, with support from heavy artillery, tanks and armored {{personnel}} carriers. As the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> closed in, Vinh and his bodyguards ran out the opened gate and surrendered. Several South Vietnamese soldiers also tried to surrender, but they all returned to their positions after Smith stopped a South Vietnamese officer from raising a white T-shirt up the flagpole. By 8 am, the ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment was completely overwhelmed when the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> overran the southern compound with their superior numbers. At around 10 am, all tactical air support was called off in order to clear the way for B-52 strikes against <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> formations west of Lộc Ninh. However, the B-52 strikes could not prevent the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> from overrunning Lộc Ninh. By 16:30, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> were in complete control of Lộc Ninh District.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the initial stages in their campaign, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> forces were ordered to regroup and prepare for the next offensive in the Long Khánh region. <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> soldiers from the two regiments were assembled in War Zone D, where they were trained to attack well-fortified enemy strongholds. On November 20, 1964, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> reached the Long Khánh battlefield, having completed a 200 kilometres march from War Zone D. On the battlefield the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 186th Battalion (from Military Region 5), the 500th and 800th Battalions (from Military Region 7), and the 445th Company also joined the offensive. To kick-start their offensive in the Baria-Long Khánh region, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> selected Bình Giã as their next target. Bình Giã was a small village located in Phước Tuy Province, about 67 kilometres away from Saigon.|$|E
5|$|In July 1964, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 271st and 272nd Regiments, {{began moving}} into the provinces of Bình Dương, Bình Long and Phước Long {{to carry out their}} mission. During the first phase of their campaign, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> regiments overran several {{strategic}} hamlets at Xan Sang, Cam Xe, Dong Xa, and Thai Khai. Between August and September 1964, <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> regiments executed deep thrusts into Bình Dương and Châu Thành to apply additional pressure on South Vietnamese outposts situated on Route 14. During the second phase of their campaign, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> ambushed two South Vietnamese infantry companies and destroyed five armoured vehicles, which consisted of M24 Chaffee light tanks and M113 armored personnel carriers. The <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> defeated regular ARVN units at the strategic hamlets of Bình Mỹ and Bình Co.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> occupation of Phước Long district, the ARVN 36th Ranger Battalion was ordered by the ARVN Joint General Staff to recapture government positions there. On May 11, two companies from the battalion sustained heavy casualties in battles with <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> units positioned along Inter-Provincial Road 13 and National Highway 14. On May 12, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 271st Regiment and other support units withdrew from Phuoc Long district.|$|E
50|$|Although the South Vietnamese army (ARVN) recaptured the villages, uprisings {{spread to}} many other areas of South Vietnam.

5|$|On {{the evening}} of June 9, 1965, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> made final {{preparations}} for their assault on Đồng Xoài. While the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> assembled their formations, U.S.-led forces inside the Special Forces Camp were suddenly placed on alert, forcing the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> to commence their attack 70 minutes earlier than scheduled. At 11:30pm <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> heavy mortar rounds began to fall on South Vietnamese and American positions around Đồng Xoài, soon followed by an infantry assault led by the 272nd Regiment. During the initial assault, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> sustained heavy casualties {{as they tried to}} navigate through the surrounding minefields and barb wire fences, which they had failed to pick up during previous reconnaissance missions. At about 1:30am, two helicopter gunships from the U.S. Army's 118th Aviation Company were dispatched to support the Special Forces Camp, they fired on the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> around the compound, and returned to base only after their weapons load was emptied. At around 2:30am, the Americans {{and a few of the}} Cambodian soldiers retreated to the district headquarters, where other local troops were holding out. Meanwhile, at Biên Hòa Air Base, all flight crews of the 118th Aviation Company were on the flightline preparing for combat assault at first light. By that time, however, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> had captured the Special Forces compound, and they began massing for an attack on the district headquarters.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 16, Allen led two rifle {{companies}} (Bravo and Delta) of the 2nd Battalion out from their temporary night defensive position along the Ong Thanh Stream to patrol an area to the southeast, which was covered by thick jungle canopy. After marching for about , the battalion found a fortified <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> bunker, so Allen ordered his men to pull back and directed airstrikes against <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> positions. When the bombing runs were over, Allen’s men entered the camp and a firefight broke out with <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> snipers firing down from trees in the surrounding areas. Again, Allen ordered his men to pull back and form a perimeter to protect their wounded soldiers, as artillery strikes were called in against <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> bunker positions. The 2nd Battalion re-entered the camp, and they discovered the bodies of 17 dead <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> soldiers. Allen's men then moved through {{the western end of}} the camp, and another fire-fight broke out with an estimated 60 <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Since May 1965, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> {{offensive}} in Phước Long Province {{had been in}} full-swing. Beginning on May 10, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 271st Regiment, supported by the 840th Battalion and local sapper units, attacked the district town of Phước Long, capital of the province. Simultaneously, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 272nd Regiment overran South Vietnamese government positions in the sub-sector of Phước Bình. During their brief occupation of Phước Long district, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> destroyed several major strategic hamlets in the surrounding areas, such as Ba Ra, Thuan Kiem, Thuan Loi, Phu Rieng, Da Kia, Bu Dop, Duc Bon and Song Be.|$|E

Tra calculated that this date would be Hanoi's last opportunity to strike before Saigon's army could be fully trained.|$|R
5|$|With the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> line of {{withdrawal}} carrying them past the Australian position, heavy fire was maintained on them as they attempted a partial retreat, resulting in further casualties. However, as daybreak neared the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> lingered, unwilling to commit to an all-out attack, but also unwilling to completely withdraw. Finally, the main <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> attack began at 05:30. Earlier losses had been heavy, though, and {{they were unable to}} concentrate in sufficient numbers to mount a massed assault. Instead only a series of disjointed attacks followed, none more than 40 men strong. By 06:45 these attacks had been repelled by the Americans and the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> withdrew before dawn, avoiding the arrival of additional American air support.|$|E
5|$|As B Company moved forward, {{their left}} flank was engaged by a machine-gun {{from a small}} party of <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> to their front, while sniper fire intensified. The Australians {{continued}} to advance with co-ordinated fire and movement, but were now receiving fire from three directions. Ten minutes after stepping off, B Company crossed the front of A Company, forcing them to cease their covering fire. Without support, the Australians were now assaulting a well dug-in and largely unseen <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> force that was disposed in a wide arc. Penetrating the position, the Australian flanks were increasingly exposed to fire, while the dense undergrowth obscured the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> pits and reduced visibility {{to just a few}} metres. Both the lead Australian platoons were soon enveloped, as fire swept across the front of B Company from the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> engaging them with heavy machine-guns, claymore mines and light mortars. Meanwhile, <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> snipers continued to engage the Australians from the rear, who unsuccessfully attempted to regain the initiative with small arms fire and grenades. The assault soon faltered with steadily increasing casualties.|$|E
5|$|At around 11:00pm on 6 February 1965, about 300 <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> {{soldiers}} of the 30th Company assembled at their positions outside Camp Holloway, where they began breaking through the wire fences. However, the Viet Cong's mission nearly turned into a disaster when their combat engineers accidentally tripped an electrical wire after breaking through the third fence barrier, but the U.S. Military Police patrolling the area did not detect it. At 1:50am on 7 February 1965, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> attackers opened fire with their AK-47 rifles, having successfully penetrated Camp Holloway. Shortly afterwards, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> mortared the airfield and the U.S. advisory compound, while the sections of the 30th Company attacked their respective targets with small arms fire. About five minutes later, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> began retreating from the facility. Later that morning the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> claimed victory, having caused the death of eight U.S. soldiers, and another 126 wounded. In addition, ten aircraft were destroyed and 15 more were damaged.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the optimistic}} Australian {{assessments}} of <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> capability, {{rather than having}} left Phuoc Tuy the communists were more likely reinforcing and consolidating in preparation for future operations, avoiding battle with the Australians {{in order to preserve}} their strength. Regardless, D445 Battalion had suffered heavy casualties and posed a diminished threat, while the headquarters of the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 5th Division was located near the northern border, west of the May Tao mountains, with its fighting formations widely dispersed. The <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 275th Regiment was reported to have moved north to War Zone D for retraining and refitting, and the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 274th Regiment had moved from its scattered locations in the north-west Hat Dich to replace it in the north-east of the province, and was now operating in unfamiliar terrain. Meanwhile, casualties, illness and poor local recruitment meant they were now largely reliant on reinforcements from North Vietnam. Unsure of the next move, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 5th Division adopted a cautious posture, with only the 1st Battalion, 275th Regiment remaining in the May Tao mountains while the 274th Regiment dispersed east of Route 2 {{for the remainder of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{unfavorable}} {{developments in}} South Vietnam, North Vietnamese General Tran Van Tra believed North Vietnam and the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> could still {{win the war}} if they pursued a strategy of attrition. In other words, the Communists would have to fight on {{for as long as}} possible, until the United States recognized that the war was unwinnable and would disengage from the conflict in Vietnam. To achieve that objective at the tactical level, Tra argued that North Vietnamese and <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> forces would have to destroy American military units, and cause as many casualties as possible until they got tired and left. Indeed, towards mid-1967 General Thanh, who had the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 7th and 9th Division at his disposal, was out to do just that. In June, U.S. military forces in III Corps Tactical Zone began to detect the build-up of <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> troops in northern Phuoc Vinh located War Zone D. To stop a major enemy attack on Phuoc Vinh, Major General John H. Hay—commander of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division—launched Operation Billings with the objective of trapping three <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> battalions in War Zone D.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} few months of 1967, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> absorbed heavy losses as a result of {{large-scale}} search and destroy missions conducted by the United States Army, and it prompted North Vietnamese leaders to review their war strategy in South Vietnam. In light of the setbacks which North Vietnamese and <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> forces had experienced early in 1967, North Vietnamese General Trần Văn Trà suggested that North Vietnamese and <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> forces could still be victorious if they inflicted as many casualties as possible on U.S. military units, hoping that the Americans would conclude that the war was too costly and withdraw from Vietnam. Thus, towards mid-1967, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 7th and 9th Divisions returned to the battlefield again, with the objective of inflicting casualties on U.S. military formations in III Corps Tactical Zone. On June 12, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division launched Operation Billings to destroy elements of the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 9th Division, which had built-up strength around northern Phuoc Vinh.|$|E
50|$|In 1965, the US Navy began joint {{operations}} off {{the southern coast}} of South Vietnam {{in support of the}} growing war. In the same year, the Navy began limited river operations in the Mekong Delta, disrupting the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong's</b> lines of communications, locating supply caches, and eliminating tax collecting stations. Based on the “Brown-water” Navy’s early success, a commitment was made to continue river operations on a full-scale basis in the Mekong Delta. It was also determined that key to the survival of the boats operating in the rivers would be close air support.|$|R
5000|$|A {{summary of}} the war game results noted that {{intervention}} in Vietnam would [...] "lay a basis" [...] for similar actions against Cuba. Because the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong's</b> insurgency was within the internationally acceptable limits of covert warfare, an open war waged against them would become an actual war. As a response, the Soviet Union and the Peoples Republic of China {{could be expected to}} change their methods of Cold War opposition to the United States. Adverse public opinion both domestic and foreign would plague the U.S. as a result.|$|R
50|$|Tet Offensive, Vietnam War: Though the United States and South Vietnam {{recorded}} tactical victories as {{they were}} eventually able to repulse all of the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong's</b> attacks during the offensive, the high-profile attacks greatly damaged the perception in the United States that the communists were being defeated since it was thought the VC were incapable of launching such an offensive. US {{public support for the}} war deteriorated and the US government began to draw down its involvement in the war as well as seek negotiations for a peace agreement.|$|R
5|$|For the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong,</b> the Battle of Ap Bac {{marked the}} first time they stood and fought a large South Vietnamese formation—despite being outnumbered by more than five to one. Against {{overwhelming}} odds, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> had achieved their first de facto victory; they had successfully held off well-equipped ARVN forces supported by artillery and armored units as well as by American airpower. <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> casualties were limited to 18 soldiers killed and 39 wounded, even though their positions had been hit by more than 600 rounds of artillery, napalm and other ordnance released by 13 warplanes and five UH-1 gunships.|$|E
5|$|From the Communist perspective, {{even though}} South Vietnam {{was plagued by}} {{political}} instability, it still had a strong army to resist the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong.</b> So shortly after the Binh Gia campaign, North Vietnamese leaders reached a resolution to launch a summer offensive, to destroy the regular units of the South Vietnamese military. During {{the early stages of}} the Communist summer campaign, <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> forces in Quảng Ngãi Province successfully destroyed a South Vietnamese task force, led by the ARVN 51st Infantry Regiment, in the village of Ba Gia. Following their victory at Ba Gia, the National Liberation Front (known in America as <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong)</b> turned its attention to the Mekong Delta region. To prepare for their next offensive, Major-General Le Trong Tan was given the task of directing <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> military operations in the provinces of Phước Long, Bình Phước. For the first time, the newly created <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 273rd and 274th Regiments was ordered to join the 271st and 272nd Regiments on the battlefield; their objective was to destroy the regular units of the South Vietnamese military, and eliminate the strategic hamlets to enlarge what North Vietnam viewed as 'liberated zones'.|$|E
5|$|However, between March 14 and 15, the ARVN 2nd Infantry Regiment {{was forced}} to turn back from Tam Kỳ {{to deal with an}} attack on Thang Binh, by the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 70th and 72nd Local Force Battalions. In {{southern}} Quảng Ngãi, the <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> 94th Local Force Regiment attacked Binh Son, cut off a section of National Highway 1 near Chau O, and the ARVN 4th Infantry Regiment (2nd Infantry Division) was pinned down trying to deal with <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> attacks. Thus, South Vietnamese attempts to stage an effective counter-attack were quickly blunted by the combined <b>Viet</b> <b>Cong</b> and North Vietnamese forces in Quảng Ngãi Province. Recognising that he no longer has the manpower to mount a counter-attack, General Nhut ordered his troops to abandon Tra Bong and Son Ha, and concentrate his units in Tam Kỳ and Chu Lai instead.|$|E
