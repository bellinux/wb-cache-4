50|$|Attic heat {{is caused}} by the sun baking down on the roof surface. This {{sunlight}} causes the roofing material to heat up, thus transferring the heat into the attic via thermal transfer. The buildup of heat is generally dissipated by normal convection, i.e.: as the air is heated it expands and rises, flowing out of the attic through vents placed at or near the peak, while fresh air is pulled into the attic from intake vents that are generally in the eave (soffit) area. However, most roof vents are inadequate at expelling the heat and require the use of a powered <b>vent</b> <b>fan</b> to remove heat effectively. A solar powered attic fan is an effective way to remove attic heat using only the power of the sun to run the fan.|$|E

The <b>vented</b> <b>FAN</b> aerobic blood culture medium {{has been shown to}} be superior to the standard BacT/ALERT aerobic medium for the detection of fungemia as well as bacteremia. The BACTEC selective fungal medium (FM) (BD Biosciences, Sparks, Md.) allowed detection of more episodes of fungemia than did a resin-containing medium with equal volumes of blood cultured. Therefore, we compared <b>vented</b> <b>FAN</b> to FM for the ability to recover fungi from the blood of patients who were at increased risk of having fungemia. From 5, 109 cultures processed for which both FAN and FM bottles were adequately filled, fungi were recovered from 87 cultures. Of these, 47 were detected with both bottles, 12 were detected with FAN only, and 28 were detected with FM only (P < 0. 05). FAN was the first bottle positive for 36 of the 47 cultures for which both bottles yielded the same fungus, whereas the FM bottle was the first bottle positive for 11 cultures (P < 0. 001). A total of 54 episodes of fungemia were identified, with 40 detected by both media, 4 detected only by FAN, and 10 detected only by FM (P value, not significant).

40|$|The 13000 cfm 'emergency' <b>vent</b> <b>fan</b> must be {{protected}} from over cooling which {{would result in a}} mechanical failure. Over cooling could result from a catastrophic cryogen release from the cryostat(s) or Argon Storage Dewar. In order to protect the fan, a VPT has been calibrated for - 31 C to open a switch which sends a signal to allow warm gas to enter the sump by means of a motor controlled louver installed at 'sidewalk level' in the ductwork between the assembly hall and the Argon Dewar Enclosure. The bulb of the VPT is enclosed in a thermal well and will be placed in the gas stream directly above the fan. The switching unit will be mounted nearby on the wall in order to isolate it from vibrational effects. Should the fan be activated due to a cryogen release, it should not experience any problems when operating above - 40 C. The switch was set and checked in a saturated calcium chloride solution cooled to - 31 C by running cold gaseous Nitrogen through a copper tube coiled in a dewar. Switching temperature was measured by a thermocouple tied to the VPT bulb. The thermocouple was checked in LN 2, in an ice water bath, and against an ordinary thermometer (which was assumed to be accurate to plus or minus 0. 3 C) at room temperature. The results are shown below in 'Table 1 ' By interpolation of the data, thermocouple error at - 31. 0 C was found to be 0. 43 C on the warm side. Since this error was small, it was ignored. 'Table 2 ' shows the results of the tests. Ten readings were taken with the switch wired in the 'normally open' mode. This results in a signal at room temperature. The worst deviation was 2. 5 C. Three readings were then taken from the 'normally closed' wiring arrangement (the way it will be wired for installation). The greatest deviation was 1. 2 C.

Live fire tests in an acquired house were conducted in order to study the effect of PPV attack on the thermal environment downwind of the fire. Temperature measurements were made using 40 thermocouples located in a fire room, hallway, and downstream room referred to as “the victim room”. Video camera and infrared camera images were taken in several locations to visually record the progress of the fire and firefighting. A total of eleven cases are reported in this study. These cases correspond to three different fan configurations: no fan, a 45. 7 cm (18 ′′) diameter fan with a volumetric output of 3. 06 m 3 /s (6, 500 CFM), and a 61 cm (24 ′′) diameter fan with a volumetric output of 4. 31 m 3 /s (9, 130 CFM). Two venting strategies were used: venting the fire room and venting the victim room. Fluctuations in environmental factors such as wind and the inherent statistical variation common in fire testing made it difficult to draw many absolute conclusions.

Of 7, 745 blood culture sets containing both bottles, 5, 256 (68 %) met the criteria for adequacy of filling. A total of 466 isolates judged to represent the causes of true infections were recovered from 276 patients; 271 isolates were recovered from both bottles, 82 were recovered from the FAN bottle only, and 113 were recovered from the FA bottle only (P < 0. 05). More Burkholderia cepacia isolates (P < 0. 01), Candida albicans isolates (P < 0. 001), Cryptococcus neoformans isolates (P < 0. 01), yeasts overall (P < 0. 001), and total microorganisms (P < 0. 05) were recovered from FA bottles. Of cultures found to be positive within the first 72 h of incubation, the mean times to detection were almost identical for FAN (20. 4 h) and FA (20. 7 h) bottles. Of 263 isolates that caused monomicrobic episodes of bloodstream infections, 180 were detected in both bottles, 32 were detected in FAN bottles only, and 51 were detected in FA bottles only (P < 0. 05). Of 186 isolates considered to be contaminants, 63 were detected in both media, 64 were detected in FAN bottles only, and 59 were detected in FA bottles only (P was not significant). The number of false-positive results were comparable: 69 (1. 3 %) in FAN bottles and 56 (1. 1 %) in FA bottles. However, there were 14 isolates with false-negative results (6 yeasts, 6 nonfermenters, and 1 isolate each of Propionibacterium acnes and coagulase-negative staphylococci) in FAN bottles, whereas there were none in FA bottles.

It is essential to consider the effect of solar heating loads in the design process; otherwise, it can shorten the life expectancy of the electronic product or lead to catastrophic failure. In this paper we analyze and compare the effectiveness of different cooling techniques used for outdoor electronics. Various cooling techniques were compared like special coatings and paints on the outer surface, radiation shields, double-walled <b>vented</b> enclosures, <b>fans</b> for internal air circulation and air-to-air heat exchangers. A highly simplified, typical outdoor system was selected for this study measuring approximately 300 x 300 x 400 mm (WxLxH). Solar radiation was incident on 3 sides of the enclosure. There were 8 equally spaced PCBs inside the enclosure dissipating 12. 5 W each uniformly (100 watts total). A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the system was built and analyzed. This was followed by building a mock-up of the system and conducting experiments to validate the CFD model. It was found that some of the simplest cooling techniques like white oil paint on the outer surface can significantly reduce the impact of solar loads. Adding internal circulation fans can also be very effective. Using air-to-air heat exchangers was found to be the most effective solution although it is more complex and costly.

Preceding an eruption, the water levels in the whole complex will generally rise. However, the geysers may erupt at any time. The geysers' eruption will become more powerful, and the water level in the complex will rise. Splashing in the river and main vents will increase, and there may be a massive surge from the east vent triggering the eruption. All the <b>vents</b> in <b>Fan</b> will constantly jet water, with the angle vent launching water up to the boardwalk, and sometimes beyond it. Fan will show why its name is so deserved, as it erupts out of all seven vents, creating a wide fan-shaped jet that reaches heights of over 100 feet, and arcs water up over the boardwalk, landing 200 feet away from the vent. Mortar, while not as spectacular as Fan, sends jets out of its two main vents up to 50 feet high. Sometimes one vent will dominate the eruption sending a plume of water over 80 feet into the air. The eruption will generally last for around 15 minutes, until it stops, then restarts again, this time fading in power. It does this a few more times, until about 45 minutes have elapsed. It may then enter into a slight steam phase, during which the geysers send brief puffs of steam out of their vents.|$|R

40|$|The steeply dipping, isoclinally folded early Precambrian (Archean) Berry Creek Metavolcanic Complex {{comprises}} primary to resedimented pyroclastic, epiclastic and autoclastic deposits. Tephra {{erupted from}} central volcanic edifices was dumped by mass flow mechanisms into peripheral volcanosedimentary depressions. Sedimentation has been essentially contemporaneous with eruption and transport of tephra. The monolithic to heterolithic tuffaceous horizons are interpreted as subaerial to subaqueous pumice and ash flows, secondary debris flows, lahars, slump deposits and turbidites. Monolithic debris flows, derived from crumble breccia and dcme talus, formed during downslope collapse and subsequent gravity flowage. Heterolithic tuff, lahars and lava flow morphologies suggest at least temporary {{emergence of the}} edifice. Local collapse may have accompanied pyroclastic volcanism. The tephra, produced by hydromagmatic to magmatic eruptions, were rapidly transported, by primary and secondary mechanisms, to a shallow littoral to deep water subaqueous fan developed upon the subjacent mafic metavolcanic platform. Deposition resulted from traction, traction carpet, and suspension sedimentation from laminar to turbulent flows. Facies mapping revealed proximal (channel to overbank) to distal facies epiclastics (greywackes, argillite) intercalated with proximal <b>vent</b> to medial <b>fan</b> facies crystal rich ash flows, debris flows, bedded tuff and shallow water to deep water lava flows. Framework and matrix support debris flows exhibit a variety of subaqueous sedimentary structures, e. g., coarse tail grading, double grading, inverse to normal grading, graded stratified pebbly horizons, erosional channels. Pelitic to psammitic AE turbidites also contain primary stru~tures, e. g., flames, load casts, dewatering pipes. Despite low to intermediate pressure greenschist to amphibolite grade metamorphism and variably penetrative deformation, relicts of pumice fragments and shards were recognized as recrystallized quartzofeldspathic pseudomorphs. The mafic to felsic metavolcanics and metasediments contain blasts of hornblende, actinolite, garnet, pistacitic epidote, staurolite, albitic plagioclase, and rarely andalusite and cordierite. The mafic metavolcanics (Adams River Bay, Black River, Kenu Lake, Lobstick Bay, Snake Bay) display _holeiitic trends with komatiitic affinities. Chemical variations are consistent with high level fractionation of olivine, plagioclase, amphibole, and later magnetite from a parental komatiite.
