Although the Obama inaugural events achieved an average U.S.television viewership of 37.8million across both broadcast networks and cable channels, viewership for the events was lower than the U.S.television viewership for the 1981 Reagan inaugural festivities, which averaged 41.8million across the ABC, CBS and NBC broadcast networks alone.|$|E
5|$|In Nikki Stafford's analysis, the {{reactions}} of Buffy, Dawn, Xander, Willow, Anya, and Tara represent stages of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross' five stages of grief in different parts. Joss Whedon stated on the DVD commentary how surprised {{he was at the}} response from <b>viewers</b> <b>who</b> wrote to say that the episode allowed them to accept the death of a close family member, even if they had not acknowledged it for months or years.

5|$|Karas, however, {{suffered}} the worst criticisms for its story. Many reviewers {{and even the}} voice actors could not follow its dialogue and presentation. Other reviewers felt the abstract presentation forced <b>viewers</b> <b>who</b> wanted to understand the story, to pay extreme attention to the scant details presented in the show. Reelfilm and DVD Verdict were more critical, stating the viewer {{should not have to}} resort to reading summaries on the packaging to make sense of a story populated with incoherent battles and characters hard to tell apart from.|$|E
5|$|On December 29, 2006, Nielsen Media Research (NMR) {{reported}} {{the results of}} having, for the first time, monitored <b>viewers</b> <b>who</b> use a digital video recorder to record shows for later viewing. NMR reported that 30 Rock adds nearly 7.5% to its total audience every week {{as a result of}} <b>viewers</b> <b>who</b> use a DVR to record the show and then watch it within a week of its initial airing. A March 2007 report from MAGNA Global, based on NMR data about viewership ranked by among adults 25–54, shows that as of the time of the report 30 Rocks viewers have a median income of $65,000, high enough to place the show tied at 11th in affluence with several other shows. This is during a period where for the season 30 Rock is tied at number 85 in the 18–49 demographic. During its second season, 30 Rock ranked in fourth place, against all primetime programming, for television series which are watched by viewers with income above $100,000. Following Fey's popular impressions of Alaskan governor Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live, the third-season premiere was seen by 8.5million viewers, making it the highest-viewed episode in the series. The premiere earned a 4.1 preliminary adults 18–49 rating, an increase of 21% from the second-season premiere.|$|E

5|$|The series earned {{relatively}} average {{ratings for}} GSN's standards. Despite The American Bible Challenge debuting to record ratings for GSN, Beat the Chefs maintained {{less than a}} third of the viewers that tuned in to its lead-in. The series premiere averaged 521,000 viewers, compared to the 1.73 million <b>viewers</b> <b>who</b> watched The American Bible Challenge. The following week, Beat the Chefs dropped to 357,000 viewers, while its lead-out, a sneak peek of GSN's upcoming revival of Pyramid, earned 443,000 viewers.|$|E
5|$|The third-season premiere was {{watched by}} 3.36million American viewers, an {{increase}} from the 2.42million <b>viewers</b> <b>who</b> viewed the second-season finale.

Beginning with the eleventh episode, ratings dropped to a consistent viewership of a mid-2million per episode, and the final episode before the hiatus was watched by 2.66million viewers. When the series returned from its hiatus, viewers had decreased to 2.35million, and the final two episodes garnered only 1.78and 2.15million viewers respectively.|$|E
5|$|Wright's {{adaptation}} {{failed to}} have the same cultural impact as the 1995 serial and has since attracted sharply-divided opinions. However, even three years after the release, Knightley was still associated with Elizabeth Bennet among a generation of young <b>viewers</b> <b>who</b> had not seen the 1995 production. Given the varied opinions about the film, JASNA published an edited special issue of its online journal Persuasions On-Line in 2007 with the collaboration of nineteen Austen scholars from six countries; the intent was to foster discussion and stimulate scholarly analysis. JASNA had done this only once before, for the 1996 film Emma.|$|E

5|$|In {{a survey}} {{released}} by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, <b>viewers</b> <b>who</b> watch both The Colbert Report and The Daily Show {{tend to be more}} knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of The Colbert Report and The Daily Show viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by Jim Lehrer's program at 53% and Bill O'Reilly's program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows that changing news formats have not made much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project for Excellence in Journalism released a content analysis report suggesting that The Daily Show comes close to providing the complete daily news.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Ciaran Donnelly, who also directed the previous episode. Mike Bullen visited Sydney in March 2001 to scout for locations. He was followed in May by producer Spencer Campbell and production designer Chris Truelove, who made preliminary casting decisions and scouted more locations. They finalised the arrangements in July. Unusually, the production schedule was drawn up without a final script in place. This caused complications as Campbell allocated too much time for filming in Sydney and not enough in Manchester. As a result, some scenes set in Sydney were filmed in Manchester; the scene where the characters arrive at Sydney Airport was filmed in a hall at the University of Manchester. Campbell rationalised that <b>viewers</b> <b>who</b> {{had never been to}} Sydney {{would not be able to}} tell the difference.|$|E
5|$|Television {{audiences for}} the final reached more than 10million in both Spain and the United Kingdom. 11.3million people watched the match on Spain's Antena 3 network – the largest viewing figures for that station {{in the past year}} – while another 600,000 watched on Canal+ Spain. In the United Kingdom, however, {{although}} the match received the highest ratings of any programme that evening, viewing figures were down by 1.5million on the previous year's final, with just 9.6million watching on ITV1, although an additional 1.79million watched on Sky Sports 1. Despite there being no Italian or French representative in the final, the figures were much the same in those two countries as they were in Spain and the United Kingdom, with Italy's Rai Uno garnering an average viewership of 9.63million and France's TF1 receiving 8.25million. Only 6.55million people watched the match on Germany's Sat.1 channel. According to a survey, global viewing figures for the match averaged 109million; this put the UEFA Champions League final above the Super Bowl (106million viewers in 2009) as the most-watched annual sporting event in the world. Total figures, which included <b>viewers</b> <b>who</b> watched only part of the match, put the Champions League final even further ahead of the Super Bowl, with 206million viewers compared to 162million.|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of videos over the Internet is drastically transforming how media is consumed and monetized. Content providers, such as media outlets and video subscription services, {{would like to}} ensure that their videos do not fail, startup quickly, and play without interruptions. In return for their investment in video stream quality, content providers expect less viewer abandonment, more viewer engagement, and a greater fraction of repeat viewers, resulting in greater revenues. The key question for a content provider or a CDN is whether and to what extent changes in video quality can cause changes in viewer behavior. Our work is the first to establish a causal relationship between video quality and viewer behavior, taking a step beyond purely correlational studies. To establish causality, we use Quasi-Experimental Designs, a novel technique adapted from the medical and social sciences. We study the impact of video stream quality on viewer behavior in a scientific data-driven manner by using extensive traces from Akamai’s streaming network that include 23 million views from 6. 7 million unique viewers. We show that viewers start to abandon a video if it takes more than 2 seconds to start up, with each incremental delay of 1 second resulting in a 5. 8 % increase in the abandonment rate. Further, we show that a moderate amount of interruptions can decrease the average play time of a viewer by a significant amount. A <b>viewer</b> <b>who</b> experiences a rebu er delay equal to 1 % of the video duration plays 5 % less of the video in comparison to a similar <b>viewer</b> <b>who</b> experienced no rebu ering. Finally, we show that a <b>viewer</b> <b>who</b> experienced failure is 2. 32 % less likely to revisit the same site within a week than a similar <b>viewer</b> <b>who</b> did not experience a failure...|$|R
