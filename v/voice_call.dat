25|$|The {{in-vehicle}} eCall {{is generated}} either manually by the vehicle occupants or automatically via activation of in-vehicle sensors after an accident. When activated, the in-vehicle eCall device will establish an emergency call carrying both voice and data {{directly to the}} nearest emergency point (normally the nearest E1-1-2 public-safety answering point, PSAP). The <b>voice</b> <b>call</b> enables the vehicle occupant {{to communicate with the}} trained eCall operator. At the same time, a minimum set of data will be sent to the eCall operator receiving the <b>voice</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E

The framework used other Microsoft server products including the BizTalk Server, and SharePoint.

2500|$|The 73rd Bomb Wing began {{combat in}} October 1944 from Isley Field, Saipan, and marked its {{aircraft}} similarly {{to that of}} the Fifteenth Air Force 55th CBW. A letter denoting the group was painted on the upper third of the tail fin, with a square symbol in the center, and an aircraft identifier, known as the [...] "victor number," [...] in the lower third. Aircraft commonly used their tail identifiers as radio voice calls (call signs), i.e. Lucky Irish (serial 42-24622) of the 870th Bomb Squadron, 497th Bomb Group (lost November 24, 1944, over Tokyo) had the <b>voice</b> <b>call</b> [...] "A Square 26".|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} which analyses the audio speech data of <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> and calculates an “acoustic fingerprint”. The audio {{data of the}} <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> are compared with each other based on spectral parameters and <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> are identified which have {{a high degree of}} similarity. The method which is resistant to various modifications of the audio signal can be used to detect SPIT which is typically characterized by similar or identical <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> being distributed to a large number of receivers. Privacy protection is assured since only a fingerprint but not the complete audio data of a call is stored, which does not allow a reconstruction of the content or identification of the speaker. ...|$|R
2500|$|The call data (known as Intercept Related Information or IRI in Europe and Call Data or CD in the US) {{consists}} {{of information about}} the targeted communications, including destination of a <b>voice</b> <b>call</b> (e.g., called party’s telephone number), source of a call (caller’s phone number), time of the call, duration, etc. [...] Call content is namely the stream of data carrying the call. [...] Included in the architecture is the lawful interception management function, which covers interception session set-up and tear down, scheduling, target identification, etc. [...] Communications between the network operator and LEA are via the Handover Interfaces (designated HI). [...] Communications data and content are typically delivered from the network operator to the LEA in an encrypted format over an IP-based VPN. [...] The interception of traditional voice calls still often relies on the establishment of an ISDN channel that is set up {{at the time of the}} interception.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown that fish can retain {{information}} for months or years. Anecdotally, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) can remember the human <b>voice</b> <b>call</b> announcing food five years after last hearing that call. Goldfish remember the colour of a tube dispensing food one year after the last tube presentation. Sockeye salmon still react to a light signal that precedes food arrival up to eight months since the last reinforcement. Some common rudd and European chub could remember the person who trained them to feed from the hand, even after a 6-month break. [...] Crimson-spotted rainbowfish can learn how to escape from a trawl by swimming through a small hole in the center and they remember this technique 11 months later. Rainbow trout can be trained to press a bar to get food, and they remember this three months after last seeing the bar. Red Sea clownfish can recognize their mate 30 days after it was experimentally removed from the home anemone.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The IP Multimedia Subsystem is an overlay archi-tecture for all-IP based core networks. With the {{introduction}} of this packet-based telecommunication implemented on top of various network technologies, we see an increase in connectivity and network efficiency, {{and a decrease in}} costs. In the past users have become accustomed to paying for <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> but recently we have seen the increasing popularity of free Internet-based <b>voice</b> <b>calls.</b> It is envisaged that IMS will further decrease the barriers to ubiquitous cheap voice communication. What has since emerged is a problem that has received little attention in previous research: unsolicited <b>voice</b> <b>calls,</b> otherwise known as spam over Internet telephony. In this paper we demonstrate the power and flexibility of the IP Multimedia Subsystem and show that with the correct service provisioning we can solve the problem of unsolicited <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> before it escalates to the same levels of email spam.

6000|$|It nearly took Betty's {{breath away}} {{to think that}} she might have a dozen dolls if she chose. But she wisely decided that one was enough, and picked out a darling baby-doll in its pretty cradle, with blue eyes shut, and flaxen curls under the dainty cap. It would fill her motherly little soul with joy to have this lovely thing to lie in her arms by day, sleep by her side at night, and live with her in the lonely cottage; for baby could say [...] "Mamma" [...] quite naturally, and Betty felt that she would never be tired of hearing the <b>voice</b> <b>call</b> her by that sweet name.|$|E
