50|$|Most pistonless engines {{relying on}} cams, {{such as the}} Rand cam engine, use the cam {{mechanism}} to control the motion of sealing vanes. Combustion pressure against these vanes causes a <b>vane</b> <b>carrier,</b> separate from the cam, to rotate. In the Rand engine, the camshaft moves the vanes so {{that they have a}} varying length exposed and so enclose a combustion chamber of varying volume as the engine rotates. The work done in rotating the engine to cause this expansion is the thermodynamic work done by the engine and what causes the engine to rotate.|$|E
