40|$|Biochar {{application}} to soil is currently widely advocated {{for a variety}} of reasons related to sustainability. Typically, soil amelioration with biochar is presented as a multiple-‘win’ strategy, although it is also associated with potential risks such as environmental contamination. The most often claimed benefits of biochar (i. e. the ‘wins’) include (i) carbon sequestration; (ii) soil fertility enhancement; (iii) biofuel/bioenergy production; (iv) pollutant immobilization; and (<b>v)</b> <b>waste</b> disposal. However, the vast majority of studies ignore possible trade-offs between them. For example, there is an obvious trade-off between maximizing biofuel production and maximizing biochar production. Also, relatively little attention has been paid to mechanisms, as opposed to systems impacts, behind observed biochar effects, often leaving open the question as to whether they reflect truly unique properties of biochar as opposed to being simply the short-term consequences of a fertilization or liming effect. Here, we provide an outline for the future of soil biochar research. We first identify possible trade-offs between the potential benefits. Second, to be able to better understand and quantify these trade-offs, we propose guidelines for robust experimental design and selection of appropriate controls that allow both mechanistic and systems assessment of biochar effects and trade-offs between the wins. Third, we offer a conceptual framework to guide future experiments and suggest guidelines for the standardized reporting of biochar experiments to allow effective between-site comparisons to quantify trade-offs. Such a mechanistic and systems framework is required to allow effective comparisons between experiments, across scales and locations, to guide policy and recommendations concerning biochar {{application to}} soil. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to develop an {{evaluation}} model for the selection of packaging systems in supply chains from a sustainability perspective. A theoretical evaluation model for comparing cost efficiency and the environmental impact of packaging systems in supply chains are developed from literature. The model is tested in a case study of a supply chain involving Volvo Car Corporation and Volvo Logistics Corporation, comparing the use of newly developed, one-way packaging with the sustainability of returnable packaging. The model compares the environmental and economic impacts of two packaging systems in a specific supply chain. The criteria used in the model are (i) packaging fill rate, (ii) packaging material, (iii) transport, (iv) material handling, (<b>v)</b> <b>waste</b> handling and (vi) administration. In the case study, the one-way packaging resulted in fewer economic and environmental impacts, thereby indicating the importance for companies to question their packaging systems. The model has been tested on one component in a case study. It provides a comparison of the packaging choices included using comparative, but not absolute, figures for the economic and environmental impacts. Managers can use the model to compare packaging systems for component supply and determine the most sustainable packaging from environmental and economic perspectives. The case study indicated that the returnable packaging system commonly used in the automotive industry is not always preferable in terms of sustainability. The article fulfils the need to evaluate the impact of packaging systems on supply chain sustainability in terms of economic and environmental criteria. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Concrete is {{the second}} most {{consumed}} material in the world after water. Due to the sheer mass of concrete consumed annually and its associated resource and environmental impacts, improving the materials management of concrete consumption is a critical problem in the United States. It is increasingly evident that the society lacks knowledge of the collective material composition of the urban environment-of how we produce, consume and dispose of concrete. This thesis argues that the lack of informational linkages is driving the individual approaches of the construction industry, policy makers, environmental agencies and waste management industry, which results in the current segregated and government-subsidized material management. In order to identify opportunities for more effective materials management, this thesis performs the first comprehensive Material Flow Analysis for concrete in the United States for the year of 1996 to identify opportunities for more effective materials management. The dominant concrete products and the end-use categories in the United States are identified. The associated water, energy and fuel consumption and emissions produced are also incorporated. Five lifecycle stages are covered: (i) extraction of raw materials, (ii) cement manufacturing, (iii) production, (iv) use and (<b>v)</b> <b>waste</b> management of concrete. Two untapped material management opportunities are identified: minimizing water consumption during the extraction stage and the off-site production stage. (cont.) In addition, three key observations are made: (i) the energy efficiency of the cement industry in the United States is close to saturation, (ii) product choice and concrete design are dominant factors for a more responsible materials consumption approach, and (iii) demand-side management is recommended as a more optimal approach than recycling in dealing with the current construction trends in the United States. by Man-Shi Low.

As such, Nigella sativa L. was collected from Burydah A-Qassim. Batch experiments were conducted to determine the adsorptive efficiency of Nigella sativa L. to remove As (III) and arsenate As (<b>V)</b> from <b>waste</b> water. The preliminary experiments were revealed that alkaline solutions (pH> 9) without Nigella sativa L. caused homogeneous oxidation of As (III) to As (V) so the adsorption process was investigated at pH range 2 - 8. The batch experiments were revealed that adsorption of As ion on Nigella sativa L. was maximal at low pH (at a 3. 0) value. The adsorption studies revealed that the ongoing adsorption validates Langmuir adsorption isotherms at temperatures 25, 35 and 45 °C. The adsorption isotherm data was also employed to calculate the thermodynamic parameter of Gibb’s free energy which gives a negative value for the adsorption of As ion on Nigella sativa L. The negative values of free energy indicate the feasibility and spontaneous nature of the adsorption process. From these results, {{it can be concluded}} that the Nigella sativa L. could be a good adsorbent for the removal of cationic metals coming from waste water...|$|R

The decision in Derrick Barr & Ors <b>v</b> Biffa <b>Waste</b> Services Ltd (No 3) [2011] EWHC 1003 (TCC) is important as it establishes that a claim in nuisance made against a site which operates in compliance with an environmental permit requires evidence {{of negligence}} to succeed.

40|$|There are {{two major}} ways in which solid waste can be sorted and {{recycled}} – at the household level, when households are required to sort waste into a given number of categories, or in specialized sorting facilities.

Through a carefully designed choice experiment we collected stated choices {{of the members of}} a Polish municipalities with respect to the way their waste is sorted and how often it is collected. In the scenario of our study, respondents were informed that the waste will be sorted anyway – if not at the household level than at a specialized sorting facility. Interestingly, analysis of the preferences of members of the general public shows, that people are willing to sort waste at the household level, even if unsorted waste would be collected at no extra cost. We calculate maximum willingness to pay for collecting sorted <b>vs.</b> unsorted <b>waste,</b> as well for increased frequency of collection. Overall, our results provide encouraging evidence that most people prefer to sort waste themselves if given the choice, and thus demonstrate their pro-environment preferences, even without economic incentives to do so...|$|R
