50|$|One {{source for}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> {{is a small}} opening located in {{the wall of the}} {{throttle}} body or carburetor adjacent to but slightly upstream of the edge of the throttle plate. This is called a ported vacuum. The effect of having the opening here is that {{there is little or no}} vacuum at idle, hence little or no advance. Other vehicles use vacuum directly from the intake manifold. This provides full engine vacuum (and hence, full <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance)</b> at idle. Some <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> units have two vacuum connections, one at each side of the actuator membrane, connected to both manifold vacuum and ported vacuum. These units will both advance and retard the ignition timing.|$|E

50|$|Spark timing, {{relative}} to piston position, {{is based on}} static (initial or base) timing without mechanical advance. The distributor's centrifugal timing advance mechanism makes the spark occur sooner as engine speed increases. Many of these engines will also use a <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> that advances timing during light loads and deceleration, independent of the centrifugal advance. This typically applies to automotive use, marine gasoline engines generally use a similar system but without <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance.</b>|$|E
25|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines {{of the late}} 20th century employed mechanical feedback mechanisms such as the <b>vacuum</b> timing <b>advance</b> but mechanical feedback was replaced by electronic engine management systems once small, robust and powerful single-chip microcontrollers became affordable.|$|R
50|$|Most {{distributors}} used on electronically {{fuel injected}} engines lack <b>vacuum</b> and centrifugal <b>advance</b> units. On such distributors, the timing advance is controlled electronically by the engine computer. This allows more accurate control of ignition timing, {{as well as}} the ability to alter timing based on factors other than engine speed and manifold vacuum (such as engine temperature). Additionally, eliminating <b>vacuum</b> and centrifugal <b>advance</b> results in a simpler and more reliable distributor.|$|R
2500|$|For the 1983 models {{not much}} was altered, {{but there was}} an {{increase}} in power output to [...] and [...] of torque from the same 5M-GE. The only real change in the engine area was the switch from a <b>vacuum</b> <b>advanced</b> to an electronic advanced distributor, yet that did not increase the power. Toyota switched to a 4.10:1 rear gear ratio for the P-type and a 3.73:1 for the L-type. As for the optional automatic transmission, they replaced the A43DL 4-speed with a newly designed A43DE 4-speed. It featured an electronic controller that would adjust its shift pattern for a balance between performance and economy. It was the first in the industry to provide an electronically controlled transmission (ECT). This allowed the driver to choose either the [...] "power" [...] driving mode or [...] "normal" [...] driving mode at the touch of the button. The power mode provided the quickest acceleration and the normal mode provided the best all-around performance.|$|R

50|$|The system {{consists}} of a magnetic reluctor and pickup in the distributor, and an ignition module to trigger the coil. Typically, Duraspark II distributors have both mechanical and <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|The second {{method used}} to advance (or retard) the {{ignition}} timing is called vacuum timing advance. This method {{is almost always}} used in addition to mechanical timing advance. It generally increases fuel economy and driveability, particularly at lean mixtures. It also increases engine life through more complete combustion, leaving less unburned fuel to wash away the cylinder wall lubrication (piston ring wear), and less lubricating oil dilution (bearings, camshaft life, etc.). <b>Vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> works by using a manifold vacuum source to advance the timing at low to mid engine load conditions by rotating the position sensor (contact points, hall effect or optical sensor, reluctor stator, etc.) mounting plate in the distributor {{with respect to the}} distributor shaft. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> is diminished at wide open throttle (WOT), causing the timing advance to return to the base advance in addition to the mechanical advance.|$|E
5000|$|The LG4 {{produced}} - and 240 lbft Nm-250 lbft Nm. Introduced in 1978, the LG4 {{was essentially}} an LG3 {{with the addition}} of a 4-bbl carburetor. The engine saw a series of gradual improvements, increasing reliability, mpg, and power output through its production run. In 1981 (1980 for California models) Chevrolet added GM's new [...] "Computer Command Control" [...] (CCC) engine management system to the LG4 engines (except Canadian models). The CCC system included the electronic Rochester 4-bbl E4ME Quadra-Jet, with computer-adjusted fuel metering on the primary venturis and a throttle position sensor allowing the CCC to calculate engine load. In the ignition system, CCC was fully responsible for the timing curve; mechanical and <b>vacuum</b> <b>advances</b> were eliminated from the distributor. The more precise spark timing provided by the CCC made possible a series of increases in compression ratio from a pre-CCC 8.4:1, to 8.6:1, to a knock-sensor-assisted 9.5:1, all while still only requiring 87 AKI regular unleaded fuel.|$|R

The distributors in EEC-III (and later) systems eliminate conventional mechanical and <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> mechanisms. All timing is controlled by the engine computer, which is capable of firing the spark plug at any point within a 50-degree range depending on calibration. This increased spark capability requires greater separation of adjacent distributor cap electrodes to prevent cross-fire, resulting in a large-diameter distributor cap.|$|E
50|$|On some vehicles, a {{temperature}} sensing switch will apply manifold vacuum to the <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> system when {{the engine is}} hot or cold, and ported vacuum at normal operating temperature. This is a version of emissions control; the ported vacuum allowed carburetor adjustments for a leaner idle mixture. At high engine temperature, the increased advance raised engine speed to allow the cooling system to operate more efficiently. At low temperature the advance allowed the enriched warm-up mixture to burn more completely, providing better cold-engine running.|$|E
50|$|The {{distributor}} also {{houses the}} centrifugal advance unit: {{a set of}} hinged weights attached to the distributor shaft, that cause the breaker points mounting plate to slightly rotate and advance the spark timing with higher engine revolutions per minute (rpm). In addition, the distributor has a <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> unit that advances the timing even further {{as a function of}} the vacuum in the inlet manifold. Usually there is also a capacitor attached to the distributor. The capacitor is connected parallel to the breaker points, to suppress sparking to prevent excessive wear of the points.|$|E

The first part covers Gaussian beam measurements for the Heterodyne Instrument for Far- Infrared (HIFI) of the Herschel Space Observatory project by the European Space Agency. The beam measurement setup accommodates the probe source and the device under test entirely in <b>vacuum.</b> <b>Advanced</b> scalar measurement technique together with the developed computational routines allows characterization of the beam parameters with an accuracy of 250 µm in the beam waist coordinates and 0, 1 degree in beam axis tilt. The same method was employed to perform beam measurements for the First Light 345 GHz receiver of APEX telescope. Harmonic mixer placed on x, y, z scanner {{was used as a}} test source to measure the receiver beam parameters. As a result, an initial beam offset was corrected by a couple of iterative measurements and the mirrors inside the cryostat were shimmed to compensate the tilt of the beam. The second part of the thesis describes the unique triangulation system, which was developed to allow Gaussian beam measurements related to a mechanical reference integrated into the tested receiver of HIFI.
