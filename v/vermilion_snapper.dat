5000|$|The <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> or beeliner, Rhomboplites aurorubens, is {{a species}} of snapper native to the western Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina to Bermuda {{including}} the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea to Brazil. This species inhabits waters from 40 to 300 m (though rarer deeper than 100 m) {{where they can be}} found in large schools over substrates of sand, gravel, or rock. This species can reach a length of 60 cm, though most are around 35 cm. The greatest recorded weight for this species is 3.2 kg. It is of minor importance to local commercial fisheries.

40|$|<b>Vermilion</b> <b>snapper,</b> Rhomboplites aurorubens, is an {{important}} species in headboat and commercial reef fisheries in the southeastern United States, especially in the Carolinas. The reproductive biology of <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> was determined from samples collected on biweekly research cruises (April to August 1992 and May 1993) and from samples collected from commercial vessels (September to April 1992 - 93). <b>Vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> did not exhibit a 1 : 1 sex ratio; 63 % of the specimens were female. The reproductive season of <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> is April through late September in the southeastern United States. All <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> examined were mature, with the smallest female at 165 mm FL, the smallest male at 179 mm FL. The smallest fish aged (165 mmFL) was two years old. Length was {{the best predictor of}} batch fecundity lBF=O. 0438 FL 2. 5081. <b>Vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> spawn approximately every five days or about 35 times a year. Atresia did not significantly affect fecundity estimates. <b>Vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> is an indeterminate spawner; its oocytes mature continuously during the spawning season and there is no hiatus between the size distribution of the oocyte classes. Total fecundity did not decline over the spawning season. Rather, it gradually increased through August and then declined in September. Mean oocyte diameter stayed constant over the reproductive season. The order of spawning batches was not consistent with the determinate fecundity prediction...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the complex}} nature of direct and {{indirect}} species interactions is a critical pre-cursor to successful resource management. In the northern Gulf of Mexico fisheries ecosys-tem, red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) and <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> (Rhomboplites aurorubens) are two commercially harvested species within a larger reef fish complex. These two species share similar habitats and diets; however, {{little is known about}} how these species partition habitat and dietary resources. In this study we examined the extent of spatial and dietary overlap between red snapper and <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper,</b> and experimen-tally compared their feeding behavior. Field data from multiple gear types demonstrates that red snapper and <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> frequently cohabited reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and Pianka’s niche overlap indices suggest significantly overlapping diets. Experi-mental manipulations show that red snapper are the dominant forager of the two species, as red snapper foraging alone ate more shrimp per fish than <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> in both the single species (p = 0. 003) and mixed species (p = 0. 02) treatments. In addition, red snapper ate significantly more shrimp per fish in the mixed species treatment than in the single spe...|$|E
5000|$|Sebastes miniatus is {{a species}} of {{rockfish}} known by the common names vermilion rockfish, <b>vermilion</b> seaperch, red <b>snapper,</b> and red rock cod. It is native to {{the waters of the}} Pacific Ocean off western North America from Baja California to Vancouver Island.|$|R
40|$|Changes {{in the age}} {{structure}} and population size of <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper,</b> Rhornboplites aurorubens, from North Carolina through the Florida Keys were examined using records of landings and size frequencies of fish from commercial, recreational, and headboat fisheries from 1986 - 1996. Population size in numbers at age was estimated for each year by applying separable virtual population analysis (SVPA) to the landings in numbers at age. SVPA was used to estimate annual, age-specific fishing mortality (F) for four levels of natural mortality (M = 0. 20, 0. 25, 0. 30, and 0. 35). Although landings of <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> for the three fisheries have declined, minimum fish size regulations have resulted {{in an increase in}} the mean size of fish landed. Age at entry and age at full recruitment were age- 1 andage- 3 fDr 1986 - 1991, compared with age- 1 and age- 4, respectively, for 1992 - 1996. Levels of mortality from fishing (F) ranged from 0. 38 - 0. 61 for the entire period. Current spawning potential ratio (SPR) is 21...|$|E
40|$|Percentages {{of mature}} {{male and female}} <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper,</b> Rhomboplites aurorubens, based on total length (TL) and age were {{calculated}} for five three-year periods during 1979 - 93. Males and females collected during 1982 - 87 became sexually mature at a smaller size and younger age than individuals collected during 1979 - 81. The median TL at maturity for females decreased from 160 mm in 1979 - 81 to 151 mm in 1985 - 87. The median TL at maturity for males was 145 mm during 1979 - 81. During 1985 - 87 all males were mature at 140 mm. The temporal shift toward a smaller size at maturity was more pronounced in males than in females. The percentage of mature males at age 1 significantly increased from 63. 6 % in 1979 - 81 to 100 % in 1985 - 87 and afterwards. More {{than twice as many}} females at age 1 were mature in 1985 [...] 87 (48. 6 %) as in 1979 - 81. The decline in size and age at maturity may have been caused by fishing pressure that gradually increased during the 1980 's. The sex ratio of <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> was dependent upon latitude and gear type but was generally independent of water depth, fish length, and sampling years. Although the sex ratios were significantly different among latitudes, there were no trends among latitudes 31 °N, 32 °N, and 33 °N. The percentage off males was 72. 1 %, 68. 0 %, and 59. 9 % for <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> caught by trap, hook-and-line, and trawl, respectively. Reasons for the difference in sex ratio among gear types are unclear, suggesting that caution must be used when interpreting sex ratios estimated for any fish species collected by various gear types...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —Stock {{assessments}} indicate many reef {{fish species}} have declined {{in size and}} abundance in the Atlantic Ocean off the southeastern coast of the United States. However, commercial fishers often state that stock assessments do not match their observations. We compared fishery-independent catch per unit effort (CPUE) and species composition data between the 1970 s and 2005 – 2006 for reef fishes {{in the vicinity of}} Onslow Bay, North Carolina. Additionally, total mortality (Z) was estimated by means of a length-based catch-curve analysis. Effort (drops) by rod and reel focused on three sites, two inshore (30 m deep) and one offshore (125 m). The CPUE was compared between periods within each site and larger area (inshore, offshore). The CPUEs of red porgy Pagrus pagrus, <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> Rhomboplites aurorubens, black sea bass Centropristis striata, and gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus were greater in the 1970 s than in 2005 – 2006 at specific capture sites. Conversely, the CPUEs of red grouper Epinephelus morio, white grunt Haemulon plumieri, and bank sea bass C. ocyura were greater in 2005 – 2006 than in the 1970 s. The CPUEs of snowy grouper E. niveatus, blueline tilefish Caulolatilus microps, and gag Mycteroperca microlepis remained steady or increased between periods. Estimates of Z for snowy grouper, blueline tilefish, red porgy, white grunt, and <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> were generally greater in 2005 – 2006 than in the 1970 s.

40|$|Extensive {{plankton}} collections {{were taken}} during seven September cruises (1990 – 93) along the {{inner continental shelf}} of the northcentral Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Despite the high productivity and availability of food during these cruises, significant small-scale spatial variability was found in larval growth rates for both Atlantic bumper (Chloroscombrus chrysurus, Carangidae) and <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> (Rhomboplites aurorubens, Lutjanidae). The observed variability in larval growth rates was not correlated with changes in water temperature or associated with conspicuous hydrographic features and suggested the existence of less-recognizable regions where conditions for growth vary. Cruise estimates of mortality coefficients (Z) for larval Atlantic bumper (n= 32, 241 larvae from six cruises) and <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> (n= 2581 larvae from four cruises) ranged from 0. 20 to 0. 37 and 0. 19 to 0. 29, respectively. Even in a subtropical climate like the GOM, where larval-stage durations may be as short as two weeks, observed variability in growth rates, particularly when combined with small changes in mortality rates, can cause order-of-magnitude differences in cumulative larval survival. To what extent the observed differences in growth rates at small spatial scales are fine-scale “noise” that ultimately is smoothed by larger-scale processes is not known. Future {{research is needed to}} further characterize the small-scale variability in growth rates of larvae, particularly with regard to microzooplankton patchiness and the temporal and spatial pattern of potential predators. Small-scale spatial variability in larval growth rates may in fact be the norm, and understanding the implications of this subtle mosaic may help us to better evaluate our ability to partition the causes of recruitment variability...|$|E
40|$|An {{update to}} the <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> Southeast Data Assessment and Review (SEDAR) stock {{assessment}} indicates {{the stock is}} undergoing overfishing (SEDAR Update # 3 2007). The Council’s SSC did not {{have confidence in the}} calculated biomass reference points from the SEDAR assessment; however, they did have confidence in the fishing mortality rate estimates. The SSC indicated a 61 % reduction in overall harvest (commercial and recreational sectors) would be needed to reduce fishing mortality to the yield associated with Foy. This is equivalent to a catch level of 566, 179 pounds gutted weight (628, 459 pounds whole weight). Based on allocation alternatives suggested thus far by the Council this would correspond to harvest reductions of 57 - 58 % in the commercial sector and 67 - 68 % in the recreational sector (Table 1).

40|$|The {{demand on}} our marine {{resources}} is increasing at unsustainable rates; however, marine policy and management is complex, political, and time consuming. One tool that resource {{managers in the}} United States use for managing, protecting, and conserving fragile marine resources is the designation of Marine Protected Areas. Presently, the public {{is concerned with the}} status and health of the fish and fisheries associated with the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS). Given these conservation and social issues, the main goal {{of this study was to}} provide an evaluation of the recreational fisheries associated with the FGBNMS. Findings showed that recreational landings were dominated by red snapper, <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper,</b> and gray triggerfish; landings varied significantly by month and location. The highest fishing effort was in summer and the highest catch rates were in spring and fall; catch rates varied significantly by species and location in some areas. The mean weight of the primary recreational species taken was correlated negatively with time, but statistical similar. Proposed management measures for the FGBNMS are expected to impact some recreational fisheries, but long-term outcomes should benefit the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|In July 2006, a {{mandatory}} observer program was implemented {{to characterize the}} commercial reef fish fishery operating in the U. S. Gulf of Mexico. The primary gear types assessed included bottom longline and vertical line (bandit and handline). A total of 73, 205 fish (183 taxa) were observed in the longline fishery. Most (66 %) were red grouper, Epinephelus morio, and yellowedge grouper, E. flavolimbatus. In the vertical line fishery, 89, 015 fish (178 taxa) were observed of which most (60 %) were red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus, and <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper,</b> Rhomboplites aurorubens. Based on surface observations of discarded under-sized target and unwanted species, the majority of fish were released alive; minimum assumed mortality was 23 % for the vertical line and 24 % for the bottom longline fishery. Of the individuals released alive in the longline fishery, 42 % had visual signs of barotrauma stress (air bladder expansion/and or eyes protruding). In the vertical line fishery, 35 % of the fish were released in a stressed state. Red grouper and red snapper size composition by depth and gear type were determined. Catch-per-unit-effort for dominant species in both fisheries, illustrated spatial differences in distribution between the eastern and western Gulf. Hot Spot Analyses for red grouper and red snapper identified areas with significant clustering of high or low CPUE values...|$|E
40|$|Unbiased {{counts of}} {{individuals}} or species are often impossible given {{the prevalence of}} cryptic or mobile species. We used 77 simultaneous multi-gear deployments to make inferences about relative abundance, diversity, length composition, and habitat of the reef fish community along the southeastern US Atlantic coast. In total, 117 taxa were observed by underwater visual census (UVC), stationary video, and chevron fish traps, with more taxa being observed by UVC (100) than video (82) or traps (20). Frequency of occurrence of focal species was similar among all sampling approaches for tomtate Haemulon aurolineatum and black sea bass Centropristis striata, higher for UVC and video compared to traps for red snapper Lutjanus campechanus, <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> Rhomboplites aurorubens, and gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus, and higher for UVC compared to video or traps for gray snapper L. griseus and lionfish Pterois spp. For 6 of 7 focal species, correlations of relative abundance among gears were strongest between UVC and video, but there was substantial variability among species. The number of recorded species between UVC and video was correlated (ρ = 0. 59), but relationships between traps and the other 2 methods were weaker. Lengths of fish visually estimated by UVC were similar to lengths of fish caught in traps, as were habitat characterizations from UVC and video. No gear provided a complete census for any species in our study, suggesting that analytical methods accounting for imperfect detection are necessary to make unbiased inferences about fish abundance...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{of mercury}} {{concentrations}} in fish {{is essential for}} human health protection. Mercury is a naturally occurring element {{that acts as a}} neurotoxin to humans and other species. The biologically available mercury form, methylmercury (MeHg), bio accumulates from small benthic invertebrates to large pelagic fish, and therefore high end consumers and terminal predators have elevated Hg concentrations. The main pathway of MeHg exposure in humans is by consumption of contaminated fish. In this study total Hg concentrations were measured in 10 Gulf of Mexico pelagic fish species using a DMA 80 analyzer. Total Hg concentrations ranged from 0. 004 to 3. 55 ppm (wet wt). The highest mean concentration (1. 04 ppm, wet wt) recorded in king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla) exceeded FDA recommended criteria of 1 ppm. Dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) and <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> (Rhomboplites aurorubens) had lowest mean Hg concentrations (< 0. 3 ppm). The rest of the species were above the EPA advisory level of 0. 3 ppm. Wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri), greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili) and gag grouper (Mysteroperca microlepsis) had high Hg concentrations of approximately 0. 7 ppm wet wt. Blackfin tuna (Thunnus atlanticus) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacores) had moderate Hg concentrations (0. 39 and 0. 36 ppm wet wt respectively). Little tunny (Euthynnus alletteratus) and blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) had mean concentrations of 0. 69 and 0. 51 ppm respectively. The relationship between fish length and Hg concentrations was significant for four species...|$|E
40|$|Marine fish {{abundance}} and distribution often varies across spatial scales {{for a variety}} of reasons, and this variability has significant ecological and management consequences. We quantified the distribution of reef-associated fish species along the southeast United States Atlantic coast using underwater video survey samples (N = 4, 855 in 2011 - 2014) to elucidate variability within species across space, depths, and habitats, as well as describe broad-scale patterns in species richness. Thirty-two species were seen at least 10 times on video, and the most commonly observed species were red porgy (Pagrus pagrus; 41. 4 % of videos), gray triggerfish (Balistes capriscus; 31. 0 %), black sea bass (Centropristis striata; 29. 1 %), <b>vermilion</b> <b>snapper</b> (Rhomboplites aurorubens; 27. 7 %), and red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus; 22. 6 %). Using generalized additive models, we found that most species were non-randomly distributed across space, depths, and habitats. Most rare species were observed along the continental shelf break, except for goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara), which was found on the continental shelf in Florida and Georgia. We also observed higher numbers of species in shelf-break habitats from southern North Carolina to Georgia, and fewer in shallower water and at the northern and southern ends of the southeast United States Atlantic coast. Our study provides the first broad-scale description of the spatial distribution of reef fish in the region to be based on fishery-independent data, reinforces the utility of underwater video to survey reef fish, and can help improve the management of reef fish in the SEUS, for example, by improving indices of abundance...|$|E
40|$|Managed reef {{fish in the}} Atlantic Ocean of {{the southeastern}} United States (SEUS) support a multi-billion dollar industry. There is a broad {{interest}} in locating and protecting spawning fish from harvest, to enhance productivity and reduce the potential for overfishing. We assessed spatiotemporal cues for spawning for six species from four reef fish families, using data on individual spawning condition collected by over three decades of regional fishery-independent reef fish surveys, combined {{with a series of}} predictors derived from bathymetric features. We quantified the size of spawning areas used by reef fish across many years and identified several multispecies spawning locations. We quantitatively identified cues for peak spawning and generated predictive maps for Gray Triggerfish (Balistes capriscus), White Grunt (Haemulon plumierii), Red Snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), <b>Vermilion</b> <b>Snapper</b> (Rhomboplites aurorubens), Black Sea Bass (Centropristis striata), and Scamp (Mycteroperca phenax). For example, Red Snapper peak spawning was predicted in 24. 7 - 29. 0 °C water prior to the new moon at locations with high curvature in the 24 - 30 m depth range off northeast Florida during June and July. External validation using scientific and fishery-dependent data collections strongly supported the predictive utility of our models. We identified locations where reconfiguration or expansion of existing marine protected areas would protect spawning reef fish. We recommend increased sampling off southern Florida (south of 27 ° N), during winter months, and in high-relief, high current habitats to improve our understanding of timing and location of reef fish spawning off the southeastern United States...|$|E
