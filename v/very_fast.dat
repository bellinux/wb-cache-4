Berger pitted at the end of lap 15 for his first of two scheduled stops, before retiring a lap later with handling problems. Häkkinen led his first ever laps of a Formula One World Championship race, before pitting at the end of lap 18. Following the first series of pit stops, Schumacher resumed the race lead.|$|E
5|$|Bohr and Wheeler {{set to work}} {{applying}} the liquid drop model to explain the mechanism of nuclear fission. As the experimental physicists studied fission, they uncovered puzzling results. George Placzek asked Bohr why uranium seemed to fission with both <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> and very slow neutrons. Walking to a meeting with Wheeler, Bohr had an insight that the fission at low energies {{was due to the}} uranium-235 isotope, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant uranium-238 isotope. They co-wrote two more papers on fission. Their first paper appeared in Physical Review on September 1, 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland, starting World War II in Europe.|$|E

5|$|The ESL {{is renowned}} for sonic {{transparency}} and very low distortion. Its midrange performance is usually described in superlative terms, common to other electrostatic designs. Its sound is tonally neutral, exceptionally spacious, and transient response <b>very</b> <b>fast.</b> A properly configured stereo pair would generate {{a very small}} 'sweet spot' where the sound stage snaps into focus. This led to criticisms of the speaker's directionality which in practice was rarely a problem and {{had the benefit of}} reducing the effects of room resonances.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the early}} modern period, it was not known whether light {{travelled}} instantaneously or at a <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> finite speed. The first extant recorded examination of this subject was in ancient Greece. The ancient Greeks, Muslim scholars, and classical European scientists long debated this until Rømer provided the first calculation {{of the speed of}} light. Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity concluded that the speed of light is constant regardless of one's frame of reference. Since then, scientists have provided increasingly accurate measurements.|$|E

50|$|The {{duration}} of the folding process varies dramatically depending on the protein of interest. When studied outside the cell, the slowest folding proteins require many minutes or hours to fold primarily due to proline isomerization, and must pass {{through a number of}} intermediate states, like checkpoints, before the process is complete. On the other hand, very small single-domain proteins with lengths of up to a hundred amino acids typically fold in a single step. Time scales of milliseconds are the norm and the <b>very</b> <b>fastest</b> known protein folding reactions are complete within a few microseconds.|$|R
5|$|Forrest {{is often}} bullied {{because of his}} {{physical}} disability and marginal intelligence. One day, while trying to escape some bullies chasing him, his braces fall off revealing the young Forrest to be a <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> runner. Despite his low intelligence quotient, Forrest's new running ability leads to him receiving a football scholarship to the University of Alabama in the early 1960s, becoming a top running back, being named on the All-American team, and meeting President John F. Kennedy. After his college graduation, he enlists in the US Army, where he befriends a fellow soldier named Bubba, who convinces Forrest {{to go into the}} shrimping business with him when the war is over. In 1967, they are sent to Vietnam and, during an ambush, Bubba is killed in action. Forrest saves many of his platoon, including his Lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs. Forrest is awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism.|$|E

Hamilton was second quickest, almost three-tenths of a second slower, unable to get a clean lap to match his teammate. On the slower soft tyres, one lap was impeded by traffic, another was {{disturbed}} by Hamilton spinning after hitting the kerb at turn five. He again failed in his attempt on a <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> lap on the super-soft tyres later in the session, being forced wide after repeating his mistake at turn five. Hamilton was just marginally ahead of Sebastian Vettel, who finished third ahead of Pérez. Daniil Kvyat was unable to set a timed lap as his team worked to solve an electrical problem.|$|E

The island where the Tenkaichi Budōkai is held is modeled on Bali, which he visited in 1985. The area around Bobbidi's spaceship was inspired by photos of Africa. When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid the difficulties of drawing residents and destroyed buildings. The author said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline {{was inspired by the}} video game Spartan X, in which enemies appear <b>very</b> <b>fast,</b> and that the fights were similar to the ones in the Tenkaichi Budōkai, just not in a tournament setting.|$|E

5|$|While {{working at}} the {{hardware}} store, Gardiner first played organised sports {{as a member of}} the store's baseball team. Gardiner quickly started playing ice hockey, with the same passion as the children who were born in Canada. As he didn't learn to skate until he was eight-years-old, he couldn't skate <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> and was forced to play as the goaltender. He had tried to play as a forward and defenceman, but was too slow for either position. Playing on Winnipeg's frozen ponds, Gardiner employed an acrobatic style, instead of the nearly-universal stand-up style played in that era, to avoid having his hands and feet frostbitten. He joined the Victorias, a team in the Winnipeg City League, at the age of 13. He recorded a shutout in his first game, but the team was shut out in their following game, so Gardiner was cut. By the age of 14, Gardiner made the intermediate team of the Selkirk Fishermen.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{as fast as}} he {{had been}} on the {{previous}} tour, Constantine was still capable of short bursts of <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> bowling. However, the slowness of the pitch reduced the effectiveness of the Bodyline tactics, and Constantine took one for 55; England's captain Douglas Jardine, who had implemented the Bodyline tactics in Australia, batted for five hours to score his only Test century. The public disapproval expressed during and after the match was instrumental in turning English attitudes against Bodyline, something Constantine considered hypocritical. In the West Indies' second innings Constantine's innings of 64 in an hour ensured that the match was drawn. Nelson initially agreed to release him for the third Test, with Essex all-rounder Stan Nichols to be Constantine's substitute for the club team. When Jardine heard, he convinced the England selectors to include Nichols in the England team for the Test, the deal collapsed and Constantine did not play. Most critics believed that the West Indies underachieved in the Test series; Constantine believed that one cause was the inadequacy of Grant as captain. In all first-class games on the tour Constantine scored 181 runs at 20.11 and took 14 wickets at 22.14.|$|E
5|$|Frogs live on all {{the continents}} except Antarctica, {{but they are not}} present on certain islands, {{especially}} those far away from continental land masses. Many species are isolated in restricted ranges by changes of climate or inhospitable territory, such as stretches of sea, mountain ridges, deserts, forest clearance, road construction, or other man-made barriers. Usually, a greater diversity of frogs occurs in tropical areas than in temperate regions, such as Europe. Some frogs inhabit arid areas, such as deserts, and rely on specific adaptations to survive. Members of the Australian genus Cyclorana bury themselves underground where they create a water-impervious cocoon in which to aestivate during dry periods. Once it rains, they emerge, find a temporary pool, and breed. Egg and tadpole development is <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> in comparison to those of most other frogs, so breeding can be completed before the pond dries up. Some frog species are adapted to a cold environment. The wood frog (Rana sylvatica), whose habitat extends into the Arctic Circle, buries itself in the ground during winter. Although much of its body freezes during this time, it maintains a high concentration of glucose in its vital organs, which protects them from damage.|$|E
