500|$|The thallus is the {{vegetative}} {{body of a}} lichen {{that contains}} the lichen mycobiont (fungus) and the photobiont (algae and/or cyanobacteria). In P.acicularis, the primary thallus (thallus horizontalis) is spread out like a granular crust {{on the surface of}} its substrate. It is light green when young, but becomes gray in age or when dry. The pseudopodetia (upright stalk-like extensions of the thallus made of <b>vegetative</b> <b>tissue)</b> range from [...] high, and are about 1mm thick; they grow in dense clusters. Most pseudopodetia are either unbranched or forked into two branches, with the stalks curved so as to appear as if combed; less frequently, they are erect like pins, and up to [...] tall. Some specimens are highly branched in {{the upper part of the}} pseudopodetia, causing them to bear some resemblance to P.robustus, although this morphology is uncommon. Internally, the pseudopodetia are solid when young, becoming hollow with age, and are composed of long, thin, highly gelatinized hyphae with narrow cavities about 0.5μm wide. The lower part of older pseudopodetia becomes blackened internally. The algal layer is not continuous—contrasting with lichen species that have thalli that stratify into discrete tissue types, including a photobiont layer—and occurs with the mycobiont in the form of granules. These granules may be absent from some parts of the thallus surface. Pycnidia (flask-like structures, resembling perithecia, in which conidia are produced) occur in the tips of small sterile pseudopodetia or in the tips of small lateral branches of older pseudopodetia.|$|E

Plants with 50 % less sink strength than control plants with intact spikes redistributed vegetative N to the spike almost as effectively as the control plants.

50|$|A {{study has}} shown that female-biased genes evolve must faster than male-biased genes {{demonstrated}} by a rapid protein-level evolution. In most other eukaryotes, male-biased genes demonstrate a faster evolution. This {{may be due to}} specific reproductive traits within fungi, possibly allowing female-female competition to occur rather than male-male competition. This is also supported the passive nature of conidia during mating. Due to the presence of pheromones as well as the dispersal of male gametes, two or more female gametes may be attracted to one conidium, or male gamete. The presence of karyogamy further supports the possibility of female-female competition. Within N. crassa, the haploid mycelium undergoes growth as <b>vegetative</b> <b>tissue</b> prior to entering the mating cycle. This <b>vegetative</b> <b>tissue</b> {{can be used as a}} source of fertilization and can fuse with the trichogyne. This causes the female gamete to no longer be subject to male-male competition and further fertilization by a conidium. The female-biased genes that were studied and seen to evolve more rapidly than male-biased genes did so regardless of the mechanism of fertilization. Fertilization occurring by the fusion of a female nucleus and male conidium nucleus or between a female nucleus or nucleus from <b>vegetative</b> <b>tissue</b> did not alter this rate of evolution.|$|E

40|$|Proteins of the serpin {{superfamily}} (~ 43 kDa) from mature {{cereal grains}} are in vitro suicide-substrate inhibitors of specific mammalian serine proteinases of the chymotrypsin family. However, unlike the 'standard-mechanism' serine proteinase inhibitors (< 25 kDa), the biological functions of plant serpins are unknown. Expression studies of genes encoding members of three subfamilies of serpins (BSZx, BSZ 4 and BSZ 7) in developing grain and <b>vegetative</b> <b>tissues</b> of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) showed that transcripts encoding BSZx, which inhibits distinct proteinases at overlapping reactive centres in vitro, were ubiquitous at low levels, but the protein {{could not be}} detected. EST analysis showed that expression of genes for serpins with BSZx-type reactive centres in <b>vegetative</b> <b>tissues</b> is widespread in the plant kingdom, suggesting a common regulatory function. For BSZ 4 and BSZ 7, expression at the protein level was highest in the maturing grain (≥ 15 d post-anthesis), where these serpins were localized by immunomicroscopy to the central and peripheral starchy endosperm, subaleurone, and (at lower levels) to the aleurone. Serpins were also localized to the meristem and vascular tissues of roots, and to the phloem of coleoptiles and leaves. The identification of BSZ 4 in <b>vegetative</b> <b>tissues</b> by western blotting was confirmed for the roots by purification and amino acid sequencing, and for the leaves by in vitro reactive-centre loop cleavage studies.

40|$|Plants encode {{at least}} two ancient and {{divergent}} classes of actin, reproductive and vegetative, and each class produces several subclasses of actin isovariants. To gain insight into the functional significance of the actin isovariants, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis lines that expressed a reproductive actin, ACT 1, {{under the control of}} the regulatory sequences of a vegetative actin gene, ACT 2. In the wild-type plants, ACT 1 is predominantly expressed in the mature pollen, growing pollen tubes, and ovules, whereas ACT 2 is constitutively and strongly expressed in all <b>vegetative</b> <b>tissues</b> and organs, but not in pollen. Misexpression of ACT 1 in <b>vegetative</b> <b>tissues</b> causes dwarfing of plants and altered morphology of most organs, and the effects are in direct proportion to protein expression levels.

Immunolocalization of actin in leaf cells from transgenic plants with highest levels of ACT 1 protein revealed massive polymerization, bundling, and reorganization of actin filaments.
