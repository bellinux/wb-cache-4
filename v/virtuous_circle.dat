Researchers at the ODI argued that progress could be accelerated due to recent breakthroughs in the role equity plays in creating a <b>virtuous</b> <b>circle</b> where rising equity ensures the poor participate in their country's development and creates reductions in poverty and financial stability. Yet equity should not be understood purely as economic, but also as political. Examples abound, including Brazil's cash transfers, Uganda's eliminations of user fees and the subsequent huge increase in visits from the very poorest or else Mauritius's dual-track approach to liberalization (inclusive growth and inclusive development) aiding it on its road into the World Trade Organization. Researchers at the ODI thus propose equity be measured in league tables in order to provide a clearer insight into how MDGs can be achieved more quickly; the ODI is working with partners to put forward league tables at the 2010 MDG review meeting.|$|E

Could such linkages give rise to vicious circles of underdevelopment or <b>virtuous</b> <b>circles</b> of development when there are increasing returns to scale at the firm level? We show that vicious or <b>virtuous</b> <b>circles</b> based on demand linkages are subject to a simple fallacy if increasing-returns-to-scale technologies only differ from pre-industrial technologies {{in that they are}} more productive at large scale. But vertical demand linkages may give rise to vicious or <b>virtuous</b> <b>circles</b> if increasing-returns-to-scale technologies use intermediate inputs more intensively than pre-industrial technologies; horizontal demand linkages may do so if firms adopting increasing-returns-to-scale technologies must pay a compensating wage differential. Moreover, when there are both vertical demand and cost linkages, underdevelopment traps can be consistent with economic principles even if increasing-returns-to-scale technologies only differ from pre-industrial technologies in that they are more productive at large scale...|$|R

Recent statistical analyses have challenged modernisation theory by demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence for the claim that democracy is more likely to emerge when countries become wealthier, more educated, or less unequal. Neither is there convincing evidence that increased reliance on oil revenues prevents democratisation, despite a vast theoretical literature on [...] "the Resource Curse" [...] that asserts that oil revenues sever the link between citizen taxation and government accountability, seen as the key to representative democracy. The lack of evidence for these conventional theories of democratisation have led researchers to search for the [...] "deep" [...] determinants of contemporary political institutions, be they geographical or demographic. More inclusive institutions lead to democracy because as people gain more power, they are able to demand more from the elites, who in turn have to concede more things to keep their position.

There is ample evidence that the success of these offshoring arrangements is influenced on the relational behaviours between offshore and onshore colleagues. However, it has not been questioned whether and how the attitudes that onshore colleagues hold towards offshoring affect their relational behaviours towards offshore colleagues. This paper draws together the literatures on offshoring and transnational teams, to argue for the importance of offshoring attitudes. It presents a qualitative case study examining the offshoring attitudes of German IT developers working with Indian colleagues in an Indian subsidiary of the firm. The inquiry revealed that respondent's offshoring attitudes were associated with their relational behaviours towards Indian offshore colleagues, namely whether Germans treated their Indian colleagues as fellow team members or as mere suppliers, how much effort they spent in communicating and transferring knowledge, and whether they supported or avoided the transfer of tasks to India. Importantly, these relational behaviours also had a reverse effect on the German's offshoring attitudes, creating vicious and <b>virtuous</b> <b>circles</b> of offshoring attitudes and relational behaviours. Certain departmental context factors were identified to explain the differences in offshoring attitudes and resulting vicious and <b>virtuous</b> <b>circles.</b> The findings demonstrate that researchers and practitioners have {{to pay more attention to}} offshoring attitudes in order to better understand relational behaviours between onshore and offshore members, and thereby achieve more successful offshoring collaborations...|$|R
