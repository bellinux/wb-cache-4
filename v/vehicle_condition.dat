40|$|Abstract—The {{wind tunnel}} test dating for the cooling module in the <b>vehicle</b> <b>conditions</b> shows that the actual fan {{rotation}} is evidently different from the fan in bench test rotation. There is an intake high pressure zone. It is easy to conduct airflow into the cabin, and under the cabin, there is a negative pressure zone. It is easy to conduct airflow outside the cabin. Both of the different pressure zones affect the fan rotation. Air path of the cabin {{is divided into three}} different areas. Base on the parameters of CP BIR and-CP, the aerodynamic characteristics of the cabin build the cooling module under the <b>vehicle</b> working <b>conditions.</b> The model can predict the states of the fan working, when the target <b>vehicle</b> speed <b>conditions</b> are met, and it has important application value for the design of intelligent cooling module control system as well...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{behaviors}} of the steel lining of curved tunnels with various curvatures are throughly examined to see the effect of wind loads due to consecutively passing vehicles. The wind pressure upon the lining is simplified into the pressure and suction while the vehicles are passing the specific positions. Results from cases of sole driving and consecutive driving conditions for both curved and straight tunnels are compared. It is found that the maximum displacements occur at middle location of the tunnel, and that the responses from consecutive passing vehicles increase compared to those from the single <b>vehicle</b> <b>conditions</b> for all tunnels. It is {{also found that the}} responses increase at the higher speed of passing vehicles while the responses decrease as the curvatures increase.

40|$|Creating fault {{detection}} software for complex mechatronic systems (e. g. modern vehicles) is costly {{both in terms}} of engineer time and hardware resources. With the availability of wireless communication in vehicles, information can be transmitted from vehicles to allow historical or fleet comparisons. New networked applications can be created that, e. g., monitor if the behavior of a certain system in a vehicle deviates compared to the system behavior observed in a fleet. This allows a new approach to {{fault detection}} that can help reduce development costs of fault detection software and create vehicle individual service planning. The COSMO (consensus self-organized modeling) methodology described in this paper creates a compact representation of the data observed for a subsystem or component in a vehicle. A representation that can be sent to a server in a backoffice and compared to similar representations for other vehicles. The backoffice server can collect representations from a single vehicle over time or from a fleet of vehicles to define a norm of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>condition.</b> The <b>vehicle</b> <b>condition</b> can then be monitored, looking for deviations from the norm. The method is demonstrated for measurements made on a real truck driven in varied conditions with ten different generated faults. The proposed method is able to detect all cases without prior information on what a fault looks like or which signals to use. © 2009 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.
