40|$|Compared with a drag-type <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> {{one of the}} {{greatest}} advantages for a lift-type <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> is its higher power coefficient (Cp). However, the lift-type <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> is not a self-starting turbine as its starting torque is very low. In order to combine the advantage of both the drag-type and the lift-type <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> a lift drag hybrid <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> was designed in this article and its aerodynamics and starting performance was studied in detail with the aid of computational fluid dynamics simulations. Numerical results indicate that the power coefficient of this lift drag hybrid <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> declines when the distance between its drag-type blades and the center of rotation of the turbine rotor increases, whereas its starting torque can be significantly improved. Studies also show that unlike the lift-type <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> this lift drag hybrid-type <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> could be able {{to solve the problem of}} low start-up torque. However, the installation position of the drag blade is very important. If the drag blade is mounted very close to the spindle, the starting torque of the lift drag hybrid-type <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> may not be improved at all. In addition, it has been found that the power coefficient of the studied <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> is not as good as expected and possible reasons have been provided in this article after the pressure distribution along the surfaces of the airfoil-shaped blades of the hybrid turbine was analyzed...|$|R

40|$|Wind {{power in}} Sweden is {{expanding}} {{in response to}} the government's decision that 49 % of Sweden's power should originate from renewable energy sources by the year 2020. Problems with noise and sound emissions related to <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are a constant argument against the wind power expansion and this paper means to examine if <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> might be a viable alternative to the conventional horizontal design for noise sensitive areas. In order to determine factors like difference in frequency, noise propagation and noise emission level, measurements of both horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> have been completed and the data analyzed with MATLAB. It is shown that there is a difference in how the noise from the two types of turbines propagates due to avariation in the frequency spectra of the emitted sound.

40|$|A dynamic {{computer}} {{model of a}} turbine was developed in MATLAB in order to study the behavior of <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> (VAWTs) with variable pitch (articulating) foils.

Simulations of various models showed that pitch articulation allowed Darrieus-style <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> to start from rest. Once in motion, the rotor was found to accelerate rapidly to very high rotational velocities.
