5000|$|Tímea Papp (born in Kaposvár) is a Hungarian {{dancer and}} {{choreographer}} {{who can be}} recognized for her work in the Hungarian Film and Television Industry. Apart from graduating from both the Rotterdam Dance Academy and the Hungarian Dance Academy she participated in dance courses all around the world. Thanks to her knowledge and experience in many genres of dance from ballet through broadway and jazz {{all the way to}} contemporary dance she contributed to the success of award-winning feature films, theatrical productions like Chicago (musical), television shows such as Britain's Got Talent, America's Got Talent, Eurovision (Moscow, 2009 and Düsseldorf, 2011) and Fake Off in addition to advertisements and other creative projects worldwide. Since 2004 she has been working on developing a special technique where she combines dancing with <b>videomapping</b> projections to create an interactive choreography supplemented by visual elements. From 2009 using <b>videomapping</b> technique has been a kind of [...] "trademark" [...] in her work. She is currently the artistic director and choreographer of the dance team called Freelusion.|$|E

40|$|Visualizing and {{communicating}} insights through maps offers an intuitive and familiar way to explore large-scale dynamic relational data. In this paper, we present <b>VideoMap,</b> {{which is a}} novel approach for presenting and interacting with relational video content {{by taking advantage of}} the map metaphor. <b>VideoMap</b> employs a metaphor to visualize video content by elements of a map with the aim of enabling exploration of video content as if reading a map. Video content is visualized in a hierarchal structure from a very large scale to a small scale of finely detailed representation. <b>VideoMap</b> recognizes a small set of sketch gestures for semantic zooming in and out, annotating the map, and automatically completing path navigation. To achieve this, <b>VideoMap</b> synthesizes map-derived visuals and binds them to the underlying data by operating the map with sketch interaction to facilitate interactive exploration. Extensive user studies were conducted to evaluate <b>VideoMap,</b> and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of <b>VideoMap</b> for facilitating the exploration and understanding of large video content. </p...|$|R
30|$|Large-scale dynamic {{relational}} data visualization has attracted considerable research attention recently. We introduce dynamic data visualization into the multimedia domain, and present an interactive and scalable system, <b>VideoMap,</b> for exploring large-scale video content. A long video or movie has much content; the associations between the content are complicated. <b>VideoMap</b> uses new visual representations to extract meaningful information from video content. Map-based visualization naturally and easily summarizes and reveals important features and events in video. Multi-scale descriptions {{are used to}} describe the layout and distribution of temporal information, spatial information, and associations between video content. Firstly, semantic associations are used in which map elements correspond to video contents. Secondly, video contents are visualized hierarchically from a large scale to a fine-detailed scale. <b>VideoMap</b> uses a small set of sketch gestures to invoke analysis, and automatically completes charts by synthesizing visual representations from the map and binding them to the underlying data. Furthermore, <b>VideoMap</b> allows users to use gestures to move and resize the view, as when using a map, facilitating interactive exploration. Our experimental evaluation of <b>VideoMap</b> demonstrates how the system can assist in exploring video content as well as significantly reducing browsing time when trying to understand and find events of interest.|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} to interacting with stored video is proposed. The approach utilizes <b>VideoMAP</b> and VideoSpaceIcon. <b>VideoMAP</b> is the interface that shows the essential video features in an easy to perceive manner. VideoSpaceIcon represents the temporal and spatial characteristics of a video shot as an intuitive icon. A video indexing method supports both tools. These tools allow the user’s creativity to directly interact with the essential features of each video by offering spatial and temporal clues. This paper introduces the basic concept and describes prototype versions of the tools as implemented in a video handling system. <b>VideoMAP</b> and VideoSpaceIcon are effective for video handling functions such as video content analysis, video editing, and various video applications which need an intuitive visual interface...|$|R
50|$|The {{fourth year}} of the festival, from 13-16 October, {{attracted}} 578,137 people according to data collected by Cisco Systems, partner of the festival. For the first time, the festival included a daytime program, aimed primarily at children, consisting of a spherical projection, Charles IV, by Jan Šíma, projected in the Signal Dome every day, from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. The 2016 festival consisted of 23 installations (15 light installations, 4 videomappings or spherical projections and 4 interactive installations) created by artists from 11 countries. The installations were located mainly in Prague 1, but also in Prague 2 and Prague 3. Two thirds of installations at the festival were presented as their world or European premieres. The festival was free admission except for the two installations (SIGNAL Dome and <b>videomapping</b> in Tyršův dům).|$|E

40|$|Within fifty years, the {{multidisciplinary}} {{development of}} electronic languages and their aesthetics {{has been in}} tune with the progressive extension of works in space: from the more confined areas of video-sculpture and video-installations, to video environments up to gigantism of urban projections or video-mapping. Following the digital turn, on the one hand, the electronic image has been physically "deterritorialized"; on the other hand, the progressive suppression of the specificities of audiovisual languages, endorsed by the digital world and defined by Krauss as "post-medium condition" (1999), has defined a renewal in the relationship between cinema and video, creating what Manovich defined as "post-media aesthetics"(2001), useful to imagine new forms of expanded art. In the wake of the historic Italian experience of Studio Azzurro, new and young "multimedia workshops" are recently developing multimedia narrative projects for video environments, installations and <b>videomapping.</b> N! 03 and Karmachina are some of these visual design studios whose work is at the intersection between arts and media, science and technology, trying to create profound interconnections between the real world and the digital universe, made more understandable and tangible by stories that arise from the need to narrate spaces, material objects, specific events as well as allowed by post-media aesthetics. Through the analysis of a few selected examples, this article aims to focus on these various forms and purposes of storytelling, that reflect the development of the audiovisual languages after the digital turn, as well as the evolution of society and its communication systems...|$|E

40|$|How to {{facilitate}} efficient video manipulation and access in a web-based environment {{is becoming a}} popular trend for video applications. In this paper, we present a web-oriented video management and application processing system, based on our previous work on multimedia database and content-based retrieval. In particular, we extend the <b>VideoMAP</b> architecture with specific web-oriented mechanisms, which include: (1) Concurrency control facilities for the editing of video data among different types of users, such as Video Administrator, Video Producer, Video Editor, and Video Query Client; different users are assigned various priority levels for different operations on the database. (2) Versatile video retrieval mechanism which employes a hybrid approach by integrating a query-based (database) mechanism with content-based retrieval (CBR) functions; its specific language (CAROL/ST with CBR) supports spatiotemporal semantics of video objects, and also offers an improved mechanism to describe visual content of videos by content-based analysis method. (3) Query profiling database which records the " histories" of various clients' query activities; such profiles {{can be used to}} provide the default query template when a similar query is encountered by the same kind of users. An experimental prototype system is being developed based on the existing <b>VideoMAP</b> prototype system, using Java and VC++ on the PC platform.

To enhance the efficiency, the system has a map based displaying interface, which gives the user a global view about the similarity relationships among the whole video collection, and provides an active annotating manner to quickly localize the potential positive samples. Meanwhile, the system has powerful multiple modality feedback strategies, including the visual-based feedback, concept-based feedback and community-based feedback. These feedback algorithms can flexibly transform between each other by the automatic optimizing strategy. Finally the multi-strategies feedback achieves the best performance with MAP of 0. 186...|$|R
