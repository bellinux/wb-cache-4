40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of a combination of <b>vibration</b> and wobble <b>board</b> training against wobble board training alone in footballers suffering from functional ankle instability (FAI). Design: A 2 · 3 prefactorial–postfactorial design. Setting: University research laboratory. Participants: Thirty-three male semiprofessional footballers with self-reported unilateral FAI were randomly assigned in 3 groups: <b>vibration</b> and wobble <b>board</b> (mean age 22. 2 years), wobble board (mean age 22. 7 years), and control (mean age 23. 1 years). Interventions: Participants in each intervention group performed a 6 -week progressive rehabilitation program using a wobble board, either with or without the addition of vibration stimulus. Main Outcome Measures: Absolute center of mass (COM) distribution during single-leg stance, modified star excursion balance test (SEBT) reach distances, and single-leg triple hop for distance (SLTHD) were measured before and after 6 -week intervention. Results: Combined <b>vibration</b> and wobble <b>board</b> training resulted in AU 3 reduced COM distribution [P # 0. 001, effect size (ES) = 0. 66], increased SEBT reach distances (P # 0. 01 and P # 0. 002, ES = 0. 19 and 0. 29, respectively), and increased SLTHD (P # 0. 001, ES = 0. 33) compared with wobble board training alone {{during the course of the}} 6 -week training intervention.

40|$|Within the EU FP 7 project SILENV, {{noise and}} {{vibration}} measurements were carried out on several ships. These objective measures were accompanied by subjective measures recorded through questionnaires. With this, we developed models describing {{the relationship between the}} levels of noise and <b>vibration</b> on <b>board</b> ships and subjective ratings on comfort of passengers and performance of crew. The various ordinal subjective ratings that were obtained were reduced through correlation, factor analyses and common sense. Rated annoyances were used to predict passenger discomfort, work quality impairments to predict crew performance. The relationship between dependent (subjective ratings) and independent variables (explanatory variables and noise/vibration levels) appeared to be non-linear. Models with good fitness and highly significant model parameters were obtained by binomial logistic regression. Ordinal subjective ratings were therefore transformed into dichotomous variables using the categories "a little" or less, and "moderately" and up (annoyed, work impaired). As such, the models predict the probability of feeling discomfort or work quality impairment on an individual basis or as a proportion of a population with a given demography. Besides level, age was predictive for noise annoyance too – the higher the age, the less annoyed – and gender for vibration annoyance – males being less susceptible to vibration than females. The models can be used to evaluate the effect of countermeasures intended to increase human comfort and performance and may serve to assess advisable levels of {{noise and vibration}}...|$|R
40|$|High-Speed planing Craft (HSC) expose their crew {{to levels}} of {{vibration}} that regularly exceed the daily exposure limit set out by European directive 2002 / 44 /EU. The human exposure to vibration can cause many effects, from chronic and acute, to physiological and psychological. Many reduction methods {{are currently being}} researched, such as suspension seats, but Coats et al. (2003) and Coe et al. (2013) concluded {{that a combination of}} methods will be required to reduce the level sufficiently to meet the legislation. The highest levels of acceleration occur during the slamming of HSC. This paper describes an experimental investigation to determine whether hydroelasticity can affect the slamming characteristics and Whole Body Vibration (WBV) of a HSC using quasi- 2 D and full-scale drop tests. The quasi- 2 D drop tests revealed that hydroelasticity can affect the peak acceleration and Vibration Dosage Value (VDV), and that a wooden hull generated higher magnitude WBV than fabric hulls. The full-scale drop tests were performed on a RNLI D-class inflatable lifeboat. Hydroelasticity was controlled using the internal pressures of the sponson and keel. The full-scale results show that the peak acceleration and VDV can be reduced by decreasing the internal pressures and structural stiffness at the transom and crew locations; however, this lead to an increase at the bow. This indicates that the WBV experienced by the crew can be reduced by considering hydroelasticity. Incorporating an element of hydroelasticity shows great potential, alongside other reduction strategies, to alleviate the human exposure to <b>vibration</b> on <b>board</b> HSC. <br/...|$|R

It is vital that the system is well maintained in order to minimise system downtime and maximise profit. The conveyor belt is the single most expensive item in the system. It must be monitored to pick up potential problems before they cause belt failure. The majority of conveyor belt monitoring methods identify belt failure events rather than belt failure causes. The purpose of this project was to research and design a belt condition monitoring board which could be physically embedded in the conveyor belt.

50|$|The Lyon and Healy {{electric}} and electro-acoustic harps are built {{first on the}} quality of the traditional Lyon and Healy harp. In the development of the initial electric harp, there was an effort to mimic the acoustic sound. While this sound may not be ideal (from a frequency standpoint), it is the sound that most characterizes what the classically trained harpist hears and expects. It was assumed that the sound would come from the individual transducers and the string, with minimal influence of the sounding board. Therefore, the board was thickened to provide less resonance and less interference of pedal noise. The sound was better than using traditional on-board microphones, but, again, not ideal for all settings. Following much input from performers, Lyon and Healy, with the assistance of Susan Mazer and several other harpists including Greg Buchanan and Harvi Griffin, developed the electro-acoustic harp, which retained the thin resonant sounding board, playable acoustically, with individual transducers that would necessarily integrate all <b>vibrations</b> from the <b>board</b> and the string.|$|R

For this point, thir-teen (13) PSSDBC panels {{in the category}} of Low Frequency Floor (LFF) were developed using Finite Element Method (FEM). The natural frequencies and mode shapes of the studied panels were determined based on the developed finite element models. For more realistic evaluation on dynamic response of the panels, dynamic load models representing human walking load were considered based on their Funda-mental Natural Frequency (FNF), and also time and space descriptions. The peak accelerations of the panels were de-termined and compared to the limiting value proposed by the standard code ISO 2631 - 2. Effects of changing thickness of the Profiled Steel Sheet (PSS), Dry Board (DB), screw spacing, grade of concrete, damping ratio, type of support, and floor span on the dynamic responses of the PSSDBC panels were assessed. Results demonstrated that although some factors reduced dynamic response of the PSSDBC sys-tem under human walking load, low frequency PSSDBC floor system could reach high vibration levels resulting in lack of comfortableness for users.

40|$|The {{cavitating}} propeller often {{forms the}} primary source of noise and <b>vibration</b> on <b>board</b> ships. The propeller induces hydroacoustic pressure fluctuations due to the passing blades and, more importantly, the dynamic activity of cavities in the propeller’s immediate vicinity. The accurate prediction of the resulting vibratory hull-excitation forces is indispensible in the ship design process, but is not always warranted. From this follows the main objective of the thesis, which is the development of improved prediction capabilities for propeller-induced hullexcitation forces based on experimental and computational procedures. On the basis of experience and a literature study several topics have been selected that are considered most in need of improvement. On the experimental side, the model scale effect on the effective ship wake has been studied. An improved model testing procedure has been developed, which is based on the use of a geometrically non-similar model hull form designed by means of a RANS method. It is shown how the closer resemblance of the model’s wake field with that of the real ship improves the similarity of the propeller cavitation dynamics and thereby the prediction of the resulting first blade rate order hull-pressure fluctuations. On the basis of the boundary element method, a computational method has been developed for the computation of the scattering effect of the hull on incident pressures caused by propeller noise sources. The method has been validated with model scale experiments on propellers with and without cavitation. The same boundary element method has been used to correct for the influence of model hull vibrations on the assessment of hull-excitation forces. Guidelines have been derived for the execution of model scale experiments so as to minimize vibration-induced hull pressures. Inverse scattering techniques have been applied to the determination of the propeller source strength from measured or computed hull pressures. On the basis of the source strength, the pressure distribution on the hull may be derived from which effective vibratory excitation forces follow. It is proposed to use propeller noise source strenghts or hullexcitation forces instead of local pressure amplitudes in contract specifications. It is strongly recommended that for the correct prediction of pressure fluctuations at higher orders of the blade passage frequency, tip and leading edge vortex dynamics are studied as well as the effect of gas content on the dynamics of the cavitating vorte...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purposes}} of this study are to develop a simulator generating a ski <b>board</b> <b>vibration</b> in actual skiing and to perform the basic construction for clarifying the ski sliding mechanism, which still has not been clarified completely. In the simulator developed in this study, the surface {{on the bottom of the}} ski was assumed as to be a snowy slope and a mass of snow (snow pack) assuming a skier had slid on this ski bottom surface. A ball vibrator connected to a large- sized compressor was installed onto the ski panel in order to vibrate a ski board. The compressed air from the compressor rotated a steel ball in the vibrator at high speed, causing vibration on the ski. A dynamic friction force (F) was detected by the digital force gauge when the snow pack was sliding from the top of the ski to the tail on the surface formed by the bottom of the ski. A coefficient of kinetic friction (μk) was calculated using this dynamic friction force. Furthermore, the velocity and acceleration of the snow pack were measured by two high speeded cameras. The experiment for confirming the validity of this simulator was carried out in the temperature conditions of - 5 °C. The velocity and acceleration of the snow pack with vibration were higher than without vibration. On the other hand, the coefficient of kinetic friction (μk) with vibration was lower than without vibration. From these results, the simulator is suitable for studying the role of vibration in ski sliding and for clarifying the ski sliding mechanism...|$|R

One of the first space applications to actually use COTS in space along with radiation performance requirements was the Expedite the Processing of Experiments to Space Station (EXPRESS) Rack program, for the International Space Station (ISS). In order to meet the performance, cost and schedule targets, military grade Versa Module Eurocard (VME) was selected as the baseline design for the main computer, the Rack Interface Controller (RIC). VME was chosen as the computer backplane because of the large variety of military grade boards available, which were designed to meet the military environmental specifications (thermal, shock, <b>vibration,</b> etc.). These <b>boards</b> also have a paper pedigree in regards to components. Since these boards exceeded most ISS environmental requirements, it was reasoned using COTS mid-grade VME boards, as opposed to designing custom boards could save significant time and money. It was recognized up front the radiation environment of ISS, while benign compared to many space flight applications, would be the main challenge to using COTS. Thus in addition to selecting vendors on how well their boards met the usual performance and environmental specifications, the board's parts lists were reviewed on how well they would perform in the ISS radiation environment.

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Master of PhilosophyAnkle injuries {{are one of the most}} common injuries in sport, often leading to functional deficits and instability, a vicious cycle of recurrent sprains and time loss due to injury. Although research has been conducted on the best methods of treating such deficits and instability, new training methodologies are continually being sought to help improve clinical outcomes and with this comes a need for designed research to test such hypotheses. The purpose of the present research was to investigate the effect of vibration training on balance and muscle function in physically active individuals suffering self reported functional ankle instability (FAI). Stage one of the research was to initially investigate the effect of a six week whole body vibration training (WBVT) exercise routine on 38 University dancers reporting FAI. An initial assessment of the severity of the instability was done using the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT), to identify those who classed themselves functionally unstable but still able to participate in their chosen sport. The group was randomly arranged into one of two groups (treatment and control) and a pre/post test study was undertaken, with the control group asked to continue normal activity. The selection of participants was based on instability score from the CAIT. A larger sample of athletes was initially recruited across two accessible sports of football and dance due to access and availability. These groups then completed CAIT and where included if scoring criteria were met. The treatment group undertook six weeks of progressive vibration training on a stabile vibration system. Pre and post testing consisted of measures of static single leg balance, a Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) and Electromyography (EMG) of peroneus longus in demi-pointe. Results indicated a significant improvement in static balance (p =. 04) and certain SEBT directions within the treatment group compared to the control group (p. 05). The results of the study suggested six weeks vibration training improved certain balance parameters within FAI populations. These results although initially encouraging, identified the need for further research with not just a direct comparison between treatment and control, but a closer examination of the effect of vibration training in comparison to more classical methods of rehabilitation before it can be recommended as a serious methods of treatment for FAI. The second stage of the research involved the implementation of a new piece of rehabilitation equipment which combined a vibration unit within a wobble board (Vibrosphere TM, Sweden). The manufactures claim the combination of the two principles accelerates rehabilitation for numerous lower body injuries and disorders. This specially designed unit allowed direct analysis of the effect of the vibration component of the unit on balance and muscle function, by comparing those who used the combined vibration/wobble board and those who simply used the wobble board alone. A control group was also included to analyse any difference over time as the testing was done during a pre-season training cycle. The research consisted of 33 semi-professional footballers reporting FAI as confirmed by CAIT and taler tilt and an anterior drawer test, being randomly assigned to one of three groups; Vibration/wobble board, Wobble board alone and Control. Both Vibration/wobble board and Wobble board alone completed identical exercises on identical equipment so results could not be attributed to different equipment. The results of the study suggest a significant difference in static balance; modified SEBT and Single leg triple hop for distance between groups with the greatest improvement being within the combined vibration/wobble board group (p <. 05). The results suggest the combination of <b>vibration</b> and wobble <b>board</b> improve balance and functional strength in those footballers reporting FAI compared to wobble board training alone. The precise mechanisms behind the current results are unclear. It has been suggested that it may be due to vibration having a positive effect on the stimulation of mechanoreceptors and the combination of that and unstable surface control seems to be optimal. It is difficult to compare studies but the research has highlighted certain areas for further research. The difference in static balance and SEBT scores between the dancers and footballers seems to suggest that the CAIT scores although similar may identify the need for more specific tests for each population. Also a longitudinal study is required to access injury rates following intervention and effect duration of the improvements seen...|$|R
