25|$|During the inquest, {{evidence}} {{confirmed that}} the video tapes had been changed by a station supervisor in three <b>video</b> <b>recorders</b> monitoring the station CCTV, at 3:09am {{on the morning of}} the shooting.

Three days later the equipment was tested and it was found that a cable transmitting the CCTV images to the <b>video</b> <b>recorders</b> had been damaged or cut, possibly during refurbishment work (the cable may have been severed when a workman stepped on it); the following day a communications expert {{confirmed that the}} alarm was sounding as a result of this loss of signal.|$|E

50|$|Network DVR (NDVR), or network {{personal}} <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> (NPVR), or {{remote storage}} digital <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> (RS-DVR) is a network-based digital <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> (DVR) stored at the provider's central location {{rather than at}} the consumer's private home. Traditionally, media content was stored in a subscriber's set-top box hard drive, but with NDVR the service provider owns a large number of servers, on which the subscribers' media content is stored. The term RS-DVR is used by Cablevision for their version of this technology.|$|R
25|$|Currently, {{four types}} of CRIDs are playing {{a major role in}} some {{unidirectional}} television networks: programme CRID, series CRID, group CRID, and recommendation CRID.

25|$|Various {{other kinds}} of {{information}} are sent over the teletext protocol. For instance, Programme Delivery Control signals—used by <b>video</b> <b>recorders</b> for starting/stopping recording at the correct time even during changes in programming—are sent as teletext packets.

25|$|Videotape {{technology}} {{was still in}} its infancy when Australian television was launched in 1956 and <b>video</b> <b>recorders</b> did not become widely available to Australian TV stations until the 1960s. For the first few years, the only available method for capturing TV programs was the kinescope process, in which a fixed movie camera filmed broadcasts screened on a specially adjusted TV monitor. Similarly, the playback of pre-recorded programs to air was only possible at this stage through the telecine process, in which films or kinescoped TV recordings were played back on a movie screen which was monitored by a TV camera.|$|E
25|$|A {{closely related}} service is the Video Program System (VPS), {{introduced}} in Germany in 1985. Like teletext, this signal is also broadcast in the vertical blanking interval. It consists only of 32 bits of data, primarily {{the date and}} time for which the broadcast of the currently running TV programme was originally scheduled. <b>Video</b> <b>recorders</b> can use this information (instead of a simple timer) in order to automatically record a scheduled programme, even if the broadcast time changes after the user programmes the VCR. VPS also provides a PAUSE code; broadcasters {{can use it to}} mark interruptions and pause the recorders, however advertisement-financed broadcasters tend not to use it during their ad breaks.|$|E

It is also noted virtual channel 10 is not far off its usual tuning to push-button 9 on analogue television sets, due to its historic links with the Nine Network, its allocation on Sky's former analogue terrestrial service, and for compatibility with <b>video</b> <b>recorders</b> using the G-Code scheduling system.|$|E
