5|$|The {{description}} of feathered dinosaurs {{has not been}} without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that some purported feather-like fossils {{are the result of}} the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' skin, and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with <b>vaned</b> feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but convergent with dinosaurs.

5|$|No skin {{impressions}} {{have ever}} been found in association with fossils of Deinonychus. Nonetheless, {{the evidence suggests that}} the Dromaeosauridae, including Deinonychus, had feathers. The genus Microraptor is both older geologically and more primitive phylogenetically than Deinonychus, and within the same family. Multiple fossils of Microraptor preserve pennaceous, <b>vaned</b> feathers like those of modern birds on the arms, legs, and tail, along with covert and contour feathers. Velociraptor is geologically younger than Deinonychus, but even more closely related (within the subfamily velociraptorinae, see Classification, below). A specimen of Velociraptor has been found with quill knobs on the ulna. Quill knobs are where the follicular ligaments attached, and are a direct indicator of feathers of modern aspect.|$|E
5|$|Feathers {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{recognizable}} characteristics of modern birds, and a trait that was shared by all other dinosaur groups. Based on the current distribution of fossil evidence, it appears that feathers were an ancestral dinosaurian trait, though one that may have been selectively lost in some species. Direct fossil evidence of feathers or feather-like structures has been discovered in a diverse array of species in many non-avian dinosaur groups, both among saurischians and ornithischians. Simple, branched, feather-like structures are known from heterodontosaurids, primitive neornithischians and theropods, and primitive ceratopsians. Evidence for true, <b>vaned</b> feathers similar to the flight feathers of modern birds has been found only in the theropod subgroup Maniraptora, which includes oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and birds. Feather-like structures known as pycnofibres have also been found in pterosaurs, suggesting the possibility that feather-like filaments may have been common in the bird lineage and evolved before the appearance of dinosaurs themselves. Research into the genetics of American alligators has also revealed that crocodylian scutes do possess feather-keratins during embryonic development, but these keratins are not expressed by the animals before hatching.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the front wings, Anchiornis had long, <b>vaned</b> feathers on the hind legs.

25|$|Given {{the close}} {{affinity}} of Zhenyuanlong with Microraptor, Changyuraptor and Sinornithosaurus, {{it is noteworthy}} that the specimen does not preserve any feathers on the hind limbs. Some of its closest relatives are known for long, voluminous <b>vaned</b> feathers attaching to the ankles and lower legs, and Zhenyuanlongs lack of similar feathers may indicate another unique anatomical feature of this animal among its relatives. However, the specimen's hind limbs belong to a piece of slab that preserves no other feathers on the body, while the other pieces all preserve feathers. Therefore, the lack of leg-feathers on Zhenyuanlong may be an artifact of preservation or preparation and, like the presence of a tail fan, cannot be ruled out with certainty.|$|E
25|$|Long <b>vaned</b> {{feathers}} {{were also}} present {{along the length}} of the tail, and are preserved as a series of long projections of vanes at a 45-degree angle from the tail vertebrae. While preservation makes symmetry difficult to assess, these feathers appear generally similar to the tail feathers of other birdlike dinosaurs that preserve this region, including Sinornithosaurus, Jinfengopteryx, Anchiornis, Eosinopteryx, and Archaeopteryx. This differentiates the tail of Zhenyuanlong from Microraptor and the related Changyuraptor, which had shorter feathers along the base and middle of the tail but large, complex fans at the tip. However, since the end of Zhenyuanlongs tail is not preserved, it's impossible to rule out the presence of a fan entirely.|$|E
25|$|Anchiornis huxleyi was a small, bipedal {{theropod}} dinosaur with {{a triangular}} skull bearing several details {{in common with}} dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and primitive avialans. Like other early paravians, Anchiornis was small, {{about the size of}} a crow. It had long, wing-bearing arms, long legs, and a long tail. Like all paravians, it was covered in feathers, though it also had scales on certain parts of the body. The wings, legs, and tail supported long but relatively narrow <b>vaned</b> feathers. Two types of simpler, downy (plumaceous) feathers covered the rest of the body, as in Sinornithosaurus: down feathers made up of filaments attached at their bases, and more complex down feathers with barbs attached along a central quill. Long, simple feathers covered almost the entire head and neck, torso, upper legs, and the first half of the tail. The rest of the tail bore pennaceous tail feathers (rectrices). Long feathers on the head (crown) may have formed a crest. While the first specimen of Anchiornis preserved only faint traces of feathers around the preserved portion of the body, many more well-preserved fossils have since been found. Studies of Anchiornis specimens using laser fluorescence have revealed not only more details of the feathers, but also of the skin and muscle tissue. Taken together, this evidence has given scientists a nearly complete picture of Anchiornis anatomy.|$|E
