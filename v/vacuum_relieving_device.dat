40|$|Background Pressure ulcer {{is one of}} {{many health}} {{problems}} in the healthcare system. Pressure ulcer prolongs the suffering of patients and the cost of treating them is high. In 2006, in the USA almost US$ 11 billion was spent on hospitalizations in which the patient was dignosed with pressure ulcer as primary or secondary causes, excluding neonatal and maternal conditions. This reflects an increase of nearly 80 % since 1993. Most pressure ulcers are potentially preventable; early and proper intervention to high risk groups can decrease the incidence of newly developed pressure ulcer and its consequence impacts. Moreover, pressure ulcer is a key performance index for assessing the quality of hospital service and patient safety. Maintaining a low incidence and prevalence of the pressure ulcer leads to both reduced health expenditure and patient’s suffering from wound pain. Aims and objectives The paper aims to study the current literature of pressure <b>relieving</b> <b>devices</b> application and its effectiveness to risk group. There are lots of pressure <b>relieving</b> <b>devices</b> in the market and here to assess its effectiveness to the risk group in hospital. Methods The electronic search was done through searching of electronic database, PubMed, MEDLINE ProQest; and hand search through Google Scholar and other online resources. Search strategies and criteria for inclusion and exclusion had been applied. The key words were used in retrieving studies through databases: (pressure ulcer OR decubitus ulcer) AND(prevention) AND (pressure relieving OR repositioning OR mattress OR cushion OR overlay OR re-distributing) Results There were twelve English articles for reviewing finally. Those articles were grouped into three pressure <b>relieving</b> <b>device</b> categories; they are cushion, re-positioning and mattresses for the review. In Defloor 2005, it found an obvious reduction in newly developed pressure ulcer if it combines 4 -hourly turning with pressure reliefing mattress; only 3 % of participants had newly developed pressure ulcer. Furthermore, the frequect turning may not reduce the pressure ulcer development in lower risk group. The proper intervention of pressure relieving and tailor to individuals are essential. Conclusions It demonstrated the effectiveness of pressure <b>relieving</b> <b>devices</b> to patient at risk, but the present of significant differences is not consistent. It is essential to ensure the utilization of the pressure relieving support surfaces function with right skill to the right person in order to maximize patient’s benefit during hospitalization.

40|$|Efraim Jaul Skilled Geriatric Nursing Department, Herzog Memorial Hospital, Affiliated to the Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel Abstract: The {{occurrence}} of pressure ulcers (PUs) is common and poses serious {{problems for the}} frail elderly, with implications for functional disability and reduced quality of life. PUs are preventable in a majority of cases. The increase in PU occurrence, however, appears regardless of higher awareness in prevention and improvement through utilization of pressure <b>relieving</b> <b>devices.</b> Multiple changes in the elderly body systems occur over time including aging, multiple chronic conditions, and functional impairment, potentially culminating in the final pathways of geriatric syndrome, unless awareness {{to the development of}} PUs is reversible and prevented. The assumption is that the development of PUs is based on multifactorial causes (extrinsic and intrinsic factors); thus, the optimal management for elderly patients requires a comprehensive approach in all medical settings (community, hospital, and at the long term care [LTC] level). Comprehensiveness signifies looking beyond the wounds, assisting the patient through both local (wound) and systemic (medical condition) treatment, using a strategy of prevention and supporting quality of life. Within the multidisciplinary involvement team approach, each professional discipline contributes its own task in coordination with other disciplines to address PU prevention, assessment, and treatment. The entire medical staff and the multidisciplinary team work together and communicate frequently in order to prevent, halt at an early stage, and provide healing in a timely fashion. Limiting the formation of PUs is facilitated through early identification, treating contributing causes, eliminating all unnecessary medications, instituting supportive interventions which include the family. Understanding the relationship between the formation of PUs and the vulnerability of the elderly patient is key to the optimal approach for the prevention and management of PUs.

40|$|Background: Participation in a {{clinical}} trial is believed to benefit patients but {{little is known about}} the post-trial effects on routine hospital-based care. Objectives: To describe (1) hospital-based, pressure ulcer care-processes after patients were discharged from a pressure ulcer prevention, cluster randomised controlled trial; and (2) to investigate if the trial intervention had any impact on subsequent hospital-based care. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 133 trial participants who developed a pressure ulcer during the clinical trial. We compared outcomes and care processes between participants who received the pressure ulcer prevention intervention and those in the usual care, control group. We also compared care processes according to the pressure ulcer stage. Results: A repositioning schedule was reported for 19 (14. 3 %) patients; 33 (24. 8 %) had a dressing applied to the pressure ulcer; 17 (12. 8) patients were assessed by a wound care team; and 20 (15. 0 %) were seen by an occupational therapist. Patients in the trial’s intervention group were more likely to have the presence of a pressure ulcer documented in their chart (odds ratio (OR) 8. 18, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 3. 64 – 18. 36); to be referred to an occupational therapist OR 0. 92 (95 % CI 0. 07; 0. 54); to receive a pressure <b>relieving</b> <b>device</b> OR 0. 31 (95 % CI 0. 14; 0. 69); or a pressure relieving mattress OR 0. 44 (95 % CI 0. 20; 0. 96). Participants with Stage 2 or unstageable ulcers were more likely than others to have dressings applied to their wounds (p = < 0. 001) and to be referred to an occupational therapist for protective devices (p = 0. 022). Conclusion: Participants in the intervention group of {{a clinical}} trial were more likely to receive additional post trial care and improved documentation compared with those in the control group but documentation of pressure ulcer status and care is poor.

Cohort study recruited 140 people with 183 heel ulcers. 77 (42 %) ulcers healed, 88 (48 %) did not heal due to death, 5 (3 %) were on limbs subsequently amputated, 11 (6 %) were unhealed at 18 months, 2 (1 %) were lost to follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models identified 12 significant (p≤ 0. 2) variables affecting time to healing in the univariate analysis. Eight entered the multivariate model: 2 reached significance (p≤ 0. 1) : severe (cf superficial) ulcers and the presence of (cf the absence) peripheral vascular disease (PVD) reduced the chance of healing. Ulcer area did not change in a uniform manner. Treatments e. g. support surfaces and dressings were inconsistently used. Many patients experienced non-pressure ulcer related infections during the study. Conclusion It is not known if support surfaces aid heel PU healing. The severity of the PU and the presence of PVD are independent prognostic factors for healing. Further work is needed to explore prognostic factors which change over time.

The VLE in this thesis can be divided into the low- and medium-pressure VLE with an experimental part and into the high-pressure VLE with a modelling and simulation part. The volumetric properties in this thesis deal with the extension of the model for compressed liquid densities. At low-pressure VLE, the emphasis was on the optimisation of model parameters. Two apparatus were built, a circulation still and an automated total pressure apparatus for the vapour liquid equilibrium measurements. The measurements were correlated with activity coefficient models for the liquid phase and with equations of state for the vapour phase. A program for correlating the vapour liquid equilibrium was developed. The measurements and VLE models optimised were needed in developing gasoline additives to replace methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE). At near-critical VLE, the emphasis was on the robustness of the VLE and simulation routines. There was a need for a simulator to find out the dynamics of several vessels and buffer tanks when vessels were in a runaway condition, exposed to fire and imbalance of flows, or all of these events simultaneously. In addition, the operation point near the VLE critical point was of special interest. A dynamic simulator where the vapour and liquid phases were assumed to be in equilibrium was developed. The pressure <b>relieving</b> <b>devices</b> were assumed to be the only devices to control the flow of material. The effect of the pipe network {{was not included in the}} simulator. The temperature range of the model for the compressed liquid density of mixture was extended. The rigorous bubble point pressure and the critical point computed from the cubic equation of state were more consistent with the experimental data than the pseudo-bubble point and pseudo critical point of the original model. The application range of the model was extended at the expense of accuracy, but the extended model was better than a cubic equation of state. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The Gulf is {{experiencing}} a pandemic of lifestyle-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM), with rates exceeding 50 and 30 %, respectively. It is likely that T 2 DM represents {{the tip of a}} very large metabolic syndrome iceberg, which precedes T 2 DM by many years and is associated with abnormal/ectopic fat distribution, pathological systemic oxidative stress and inflammation. However, the definitions are still evolving with the role of different fat depots being critical. Hormetic stimuli, which include exercise, calorie restriction, temperature extremes, dehydration and even some dietary components (such as plant polyphenols), may well modulate fat deposition. All induce physiological levels of oxidative stress, which results in mitochondrial biogenesis and increased anti-oxidant capacity, improving metabolic flexibility and the ability to deal with lipids. We propose that the Gulf Metabolic Syndrome results from an unusually rapid loss of hormetic stimuli within an epigenetically important time frame of 2 - 3 generations. Epigenetics indicates that thriftiness can be programmed by the environment and passed down through several generations. Thus this loss of hormesis can result in continuation of metabolic inflexibility, with mothers exposing the foetus to a milieu that perpetuates a stressed epigenotype. As the metabolic syndrome increases oxidative stress and reduces life expectancy, a better descriptor may therefore be the Lifestyle-Induced Metabolic Inflexibility and accelerated AGEing syndrome – LIMIT-AGE. As life expectancy in the Gulf begins to fall, with perhaps a third of this life being unhealthy – including premature loss of sexual function, it is vital to detect evidence of this condition as early in life as possible. One effective {{way to do this is}} by detecting evidence of metabolic inflexibility by studying body fat content and distribution by magnetic resonance (MR). The Gulf Metabolic Syndrome thus represents an accelerated form of the metabolic syndrome induced by the unprecedented rapidity of lifestyle change in the region, the stress of which is being passed from generation to generation and may be accumulative. The fundamental cause is probably due to a rapid increase in countrywide wealth. This has benefited most socioeconomic groups, resulting in the development of an obesogenic environment as the result of the rapid adoption of Western labour saving and stress <b>relieving</b> <b>devices</b> (e. g. cars and air conditioning), as well as the associated high calorie diet...|$|R

We propose Caelus, which addresses these shortcoming. The key insight that enables Caelus to do this is having the cloud service declare the timing and order of operations on the cloud service. This <b>relieves</b> Caelus <b>devices</b> from having to record and send the timing and order of operations to each other – instead, they need to only ensure that the timing and order of operations both conforms to the cloud’s promised consistency model and that it is perceived identically on all devices.

40|$|The {{function}} of the suppression-chamber-to-drywell vacuum breakers is to <b>relieve</b> <b>vacuum</b> in the drywell. There are four vacuum breakers located outside the primary containment which form {{an extension of the}} primary containment boundary. The vacuum relief valves are mounted in special piping between the drywell and the suppression chamber, which allow air and steam flow from the suppression chamber to the drywell when the drywell is at a negative pressure with respect to the suppression chamber. Therefore, suppression chamber-to-drywell vacuum breakers prevent an excessive negative differential pressure across the wetwell drywell boundary. Each vacuum breaker is a self actuating valve with one vacuum breaker in each line. Manual isolation valves are located on each side of each vacuum breaker. A negative differential pressure across the drywell wall is caused by rapid depressurization of the drywell. Events that cause this rapid depressurization are cooling cycles, inadvertent drywell spray actuation, and steam condensation from sprays or subcooled water reflood of a break {{in the event of a}} primary system rupture. Cooling cycles result in minor pressure transients in the drywell that occur slowly and are normally controlled by heating and ventilation equipment. Spray actuation or spill of subcooled water out of a break results in more significant pressure transients and becomes important in sizing the vacuum breakers. In the event of a primary system rupture, steam condensation within the drywell results in the most severe pressure transient. Following a primary system rupture, air in the drywell is purged into the suppression chamber free airspace, leaving the drywell full of steam. Subsequent condensation of the steam can be caused in two possible ways, namely, Emergency Core Cooling Systems flow from a recirculation line break, or drywell spray actuation following a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). These two cases determine the maximum depressurization rate of the drywell...|$|R

Magnesium coated glass slides were etched with chlorine, fluorine, and fluorocarbon gasses alone and in the presence of argon to determine which chemistry would etch the fastest. Magnesium was chosen because it was the easiest to handle among the active metals. It was determined that chlorine gas with argon provided the highest etch rate. Next, a set of factorial experiments were conducted to determine the sensitivity of the etch process to changing radio frequency power input, chamber pressure, and the ratio of chlorine to argon. (cont.) Factor levels were arranged in an orthogonal array and the main effects of each parameter were estimated using analysis of means. It was found that the etch rate increases strongly with increasing power and decreasing amounts of chlorine. Dependence on pressure was less pronounced. These results indicate that the etching mechanism is dependent on physical sputtering. Etch rates of up to 30 nm/min were achieved at 350 W power, 20 mTorr chamber pressure, and a 10 %/ 90 % chlorine to argon ratio. In conclusion, although the etch rate is not currently high enough for practical use, the steps in the decision tree were validated by the first set of experiments while the second set was able to characterize the basic mechanism of the etch process. by Keane T.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effectiveness of cupping in relieving the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Methods In a two-group, randomized controlled exploratory pilot study patients with a clinically and radiological confirmed knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence Grading Scale: 2 - 4) and a pain intensity[*]>[*] 40 [*]mm on a 100 [*]mm visual analogue scale (VAS) were included. 40 Patients were randomized to either 8 sessions of pulsatile dry cupping within 4 [*]weeks or no intervention (control). Paracetamol was allowed on demand for both groups. Outcomes were the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) score, the pain intensity on a VAS (0 [*]mm[*]=[*]no pain to 100 [*]mm[*]=[*]maximum intensity) and Quality of Life (SF- 36) 4 and 12 [*]weeks after randomization. Use of Paracetamol was documented within the 4 -week treatment period. Analyses were performed by analysis of covariance adjusting for the baseline value for each outcome. Results 21 patients were allocated to the cupping group (5 male; mean age 68 [*]±[*]SD 7. 2) and 19 to the control group (8 male; 69 [*]±[*] 6. 8). After 4 [*]weeks the WOMAC global score improved significantly more in the cupping group with a mean of 27. 7 (95 % confidence interval 22. 1; 33. 3) compared to 42. 2 (36. 3; 48. 1) in the control group (p[*]=[*] 0. 001). After 12 [*]weeks the WOMAC global score were still significantly different in favor for cupping (31. 0 (24. 9; 37. 2) vs. 40. 8 (34. 4; 47. 3) p[*]=[*] 0. 032), however the WOMAC subscores for pain and stiffness were not significant anymore. Significantly better outcomes in the cupping group were also observed for pain intensity on VAS and for the SF- 36 Physical Component Scale compared to the control group after 4 and 12 [*]weeks. No significant difference was observed for the SF- 36 Mental Component Scale and the total number of consumed Paracetamol tablets between both groups (mean 9. 1, SD ± 20. 0 vs. 11. 5 ± 15. 9). Conclusion In this exploratory study dry cupping with a pulsatile cupping <b>device</b> <b>relieved</b> symptoms of knee OA compared to no intervention. Further studies comparing cupping with active treatments are needed. Trial registration Clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT 01057043 </p...|$|R
30|$|The {{notion of}} ABS was first {{proposed}} by Maji in [5]. Since then, many ABS schemes {{have been proposed}} by researchers worldwide. Existing literatures of ABS can be classified to three types {{in terms of the}} data access structure :(1)ABS using threshold structure [10 – 12]; (2) ABS using LSSS access structure [13 – 15];(3) ABS using access tree [16], which has been illustrated in Fig.  1. Besides access structure, different ABS schemes have different advantages and performances. A. Escala et al. in [13] proposed a user-revocable attribute based signature. If a user drops some of the attributes, his signing privilege can be exactly withdrawn. Their scheme also achieves adaptively security in the standard model. S. Shahandashti et al. in [10] construct a threshold ABS and applied it to credential systems. Their scheme enables a signature holder to prove possession of signatures by revealing only the relevant attributes of the signer, hence providing signer attribute privacy for the signature holder. S. Kumar et.al in [11] proposed an ABS which is equipped with multiple threshold access structure. Their scheme is efficient as well as stretchable. Tatsuaki et al. in [16] proposed a decentralized multi-authority ABS. In their scheme, due to the introducing of multiple authorities, thus no central CA is needed. However, this also brings about other problems such as parameter synchronization, time synchronization, etc. Besides, the efficiency of their scheme can be further improved. S.L Ding et al. proposed a traceable ABS in [14], which allows PKG and the issuing authority join together to trace the identity of a malicious signer. However, since the trace algorithm needs frequent participation of PKG, it may be exposed to more internal and external security risks. Li et al. in [15] proposed a novel ABS with hidden attribute property. In their scheme, anonymous user revocation is achieved. Liu et al. in [17] proposed an attribute based multisignature scheme, which allows a number of users to participate to authenticate a message with only one signature. Their scheme is shown to be secure and is more appropriate to be applied for wireless communications. Chen et al. in [9] proposed a new paradigm named “Outsourced ABS”. The computation load in their scheme is reduced sharply by delegating most of the computation work to a semi-trusted server, thus this will <b>relieve</b> the terminal <b>devices</b> from heavy computation burden. The high efficiency and security level makes their scheme an excellent method for providing data authentication in cloud computing. Xu et al. in [18] propose an ABS scheme with dynamic user revocation. Their scheme has superior performance with regard to scalability, which is able to be applied to massive data storage environments.|$|R
