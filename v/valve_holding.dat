50|$|In the pictured {{single-stage}} regulator, a {{force balance}} {{is used on}} the diaphragm to control a poppet valve in order to regulate pressure. With no inlet pressure, the spring above the diaphragm pushes {{it down on the}} poppet <b>valve,</b> <b>holding</b> it open. Once inlet pressure is introduced, the open poppet allows flow to the diaphragm and pressure in the upper chamber increases, until the diaphragm is pushed upward against the spring, causing the poppet to reduce flow, finally stopping further increase of pressure. By adjusting the top screw, the downward pressure on the diaphragm can be increased, requiring more pressure in the upper chamber to maintain equilibrium. In this way, the outlet pressure of the regulator is controlled.|$|E

METHODS: This randomized dou-ble-blind, double-dummy crossover study included subjects, 18 – 40 years old, with nocturnal bron-chospasm (20 % overnight decrease in peak flow on 3 of 7 nights during run-in), FEV 1 60 – 80 % predicted during the day, and> 12 % increase after albuterol. Subjects slept in the clinical research center up to 3 nights for each treatment. FEV 1 and heart rate were measured upon awakening spontaneously or at 4 : 00 AM, and 15 min after each dose of 1, 2, and 4 cumulative puffs of albuterol via metered-dose inhaler.

40|$|SUMMARY: Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) {{which have}} a <b>valve</b> <b>holding</b> chamber plus a {{mouthpiece}} or mask have, in recent years, markedly improved the ease, speed and reliability of aerosol therapy for reversible airflow obstruction in adults, children and infants. MDIs, effective and easily accessible when patients are away from home, are {{the gold standard for}} the treatment of reversible airflow obstruction since they provide reliable, reproducible, effort-independent dosing, protection of their contents from environmental humidity and bacterial infection {{and at the same time}} are the most readily pocketable, efficient and least expensive aerosol therapy devices available. When combined with add-on devices they are also the most versatile delivery system because they are well suited to a variety of patients and virtually any therapeutic task. With our improved understanding of the importance of drug targeting to the site of action, the most important aspects of the relationship between particle size and drug deposition throughout the lower respiratory tract are discussed. This review also looks at add-on devices and training issues related to the proper co-ordination of drug delivery with inhalation, and reports on new technology and non-ozone depleting propellants. 2001 Academic Pres...|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred and}} eleven {{children}} with acute asthma were studied to compare delivery of terbutaline by either a {{metered dose inhaler}} (MDI) with a <b>valved</b> <b>holding</b> chamber or a nebuliser driven by air. Eligible patients were randomised; the MDI group received three puffs (0. 75 mg) of terbutaline and the nebuliser group received 2 ml (5. 0 mg) terbutaline solution diluted with 2 ml 0. 9 % saline for inhalation over 10 minutes. Patients were evaluated by spirometry, pulse oximetry, and clinical severity scoring system at baseline and again 15 minutes after the beginning of treatment. The baseline data {{of the two groups}} were not significantly different. All parameters of spirometry, except the peak expiratory flow (PEF) for the nebuliser group, and clinical severity score for both groups significantly improved after terbutaline treatment. Compared with the nebuliser group, the MDI group after treatment had better mean (SD) oxygen saturation (SaO 2; 96. 82 (1. 63) % v 95. 44 (1. 88) %), frequency of oxygen desaturation (23. 2 % v 47. 3 %), absolute increase of PEF (32. 6 (37. 7) l/min v 10. 2 (34. 7) l/min), and SaO 2 (0. 54 (1. 64) % v - 0. 47 (1. 84) %). There was also a mean (SD) per cent increase of forced expiratory volume in one second (22. 9 (21. 0) % v 15. 4 (16. 1) %), PEF (27. 7 (38. 4) %) v 7. 7 (25. 1) %), and SaO 2 (0. 58 (1. 72) % v - 0. 47 (1. 93) %).

40|$|SummaryInhaled {{corticosteroids}} (ICSs) {{have become}} the mainstay of chronic controller therapy to treat airways inflammation in asthma and to reduce exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An array of ICSs are now available that are aerosolized by a range of delivery systems. Such devices include pressurized (or propellant) metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs), pMDIs plus <b>valved</b> <b>holding</b> chambers or spacers, breath-actuated inhalers, and nebulizers. More recently, dry-powder inhalers (DPIs) were developed to help overcome problems of hand–breath coordination associated with pMDIs. The clinical benefit of ICSs therapy is determined by a complex interplay between the nature and severity of the disease, the type of drug and its formulation, and characteristics of the delivery device together with the patient's ability to use the device correctly. The ICSs budesonide is available by pMDI, DPI, and nebulizer—allowing the physician to select the best device for each individual patient.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{incidence of}} asthma yields 250 000 deaths annually, being {{almost all of}} these deaths avoidable. The inhalation therapy is the preferable route to deliver bronchodilator/antiinflammatory drugs to the patient lungs. Within this route of treatment, pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDI’s) are the cornerstone devices. When coupled with a <b>valved</b> <b>holding</b> chamber (VHC), its efficiency increases and the limitations almost vanish. The VHC devices efficiency is something of interest to measure. For that, it is necessary an experimental setup that evaluates the amount of drug delivered by the device. This setup shall replicate a human breath waveform as input, therefore a breath simulator machine was build. The report herein describes the project process of the form-closed cam-follower mechanism necessary to replicate the waveform. The design and dimensional constrains are input in the cam design, leading to a piston diameter of 63. 0 mm and a cam base diameter of 250. 0 mm.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Metered-dose inhalers with <b>valved</b> <b>holding</b> {{chambers}} (MDI-VHCs) {{have been}} shown to be equivalent to small-volume nebulizers (SVNs) for the delivery of bronchodilators in children. At Seattle Children’s Hospital and Regional Medical Center we sought to implement the conversion from SVN to MDI-delivered albuterol in nonintubated patients receiving intermittent treatments. METHODS: There were 4 distinct interventions used to plan and implement this conversion program: (1) literature review, (2) product selection, (3) policy and operational changes, and (4) staff training. Bronchodilator administration guidelines and clinical pathways for asthma and bronchiolitis were revised to recommend MDI-VHC use in lieu of SVNs. Computerized phy-sician order sets were amended to indicate MDI-VHC as the preferred method of delivering inhaled albuterol in children with asthma and bronchiolitis. Data from administrative case mix files and computerized medication delivery systems were used to assess the impact of our program. RE-SULTS: MDI-VHC utilization increased from 25 % to 77 % among all non-intensive-care patients receiving albuterol, and from 10 % to 79 % among patients with asthma (p < 0. 001). Duration of stay among patients with asthma was unchanged after conversion to MDI-VHC (p 0. 53).

40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Valved</b> <b>holding</b> {{chambers}} (VHCs) or spacers are devices {{which have}} been used with pressurised metered dose inhaler containing inhaled corticosteroids and beta agonists or muscarinic inhibitors in patients of chronic obstructive airway diseases. Spacers can be a reservoir of bacteria. 1 Biofilms may be produced by bacteria which protect them from antibiotic penetration thus making them antibiotic resistant. There are very few studies on spacer devices related to bacterial infection in patients due to spacer use. OBJECTIVES To investigate if spacer is a potential source of infection in patients of obstructive airway diseases. To identify the organisms grown and whether they produce biofilms.

Methods: The performance of the AeroChamber and nonconventional accessory devices, including a toilet paper roll, paper towel roll, rolled paper, plastic bottle spacer, plastic bottle reverse-flow holding chamber, and nebulizer reservoir tubing, were compared to no accessory device. Throat deposition and respirable mass were evaluated using a United States Pharmacopeia (USP) inlet ("throat") coupled to instrumentation for particle size analysis. Each configuration was tested with three actuations and repeated in quadruplicate. The amount of drug deposition was quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. The {{data were analyzed using}} multiple independent t-tests assuming unequal variances. An a priori α-threshold of 0. 05 was used with a Bonferroni corrected α of 0. 007. Main Results: Compared to the pMDI alone, all of the accessory devices had significantly lower throat deposition (p < 0. 001) and significantly higher respirable fraction (p < 0. 001). Differences in respirable mass were not significant for any accessory device (p ≥ 0. 049), except the paper towel roll and the nebulizer reservoir tubing (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Under these testing circumstances, nonconventional accessory devices, such as the toilet paper roll, rolled paper, plastic bottle spacer, and plastic bottle reverse-flow holding chamber, effectively reduce throat deposition and maintain respirable mass compared to a QVAR pMDI alone.

Traditional aerosol therapies with the lung as the target consist of short-acting β 2 -adrenergic agonists and long-acting β 2 -adrenergic agonists (LABA), anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, antibiotics and mucolytics.

Results Six trials (n = 491) met criteria for inclusion. Patients who received b-agonists by MDI+VHC showed {{a significant decrease in}} the admission rate compared with those by nebulizer (OR, 0. 42; 95 % CI, 0. 24 - 0. 72; P =. 002); this decrease was even more significant among children with moderate to severe exacerbations (OR, 0. 27; 95 % CI, 0. 13 - 0. 54; P =. 0003). Finally, measure of severity (eg, clinical score) significantly improved in the group who received b-agonists by MDI+VHC in comparison to those who received nebulizer treatment (standardized mean difference, 0. 44; 95 % CI, 0. 68 to 0. 20; P =. 0003).

Filter bypass may occur if the filter is clogged or the oil is thickened by cold weather. The overpressure relief valve is frequently incorporated into the oil filter. Filters mounted such that oil tends to drain from them usually incorporate an anti-drainback <b>valve</b> to <b>hold</b> oil in the filter after the engine (or other lubrication system) is shut down. This is done to avoid a delay in oil pressure buildup once the system is restarted; without an anti-drainback valve, pressurized oil would have to fill the filter before travelling onward to the engine's working parts. This situation can cause premature wear of moving parts due to initial lack of oil.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of vascular and heart valve surgeries {{have contributed to}} improve outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. However, there are drawbacks, such as risk of infection and lack of growth potential. Tissue engineered vascular graft (TEVG) and tissue engineered heart <b>valve</b> (TEHV) <b>hold</b> great promise to address these drawbacks as the ideal TEVG and TEHV is easily implanted, biocompatible, non thrombogenic, durable, degradable, and ultimately remodels into nativelike tissue. In general, the TEVG and/or TEHV concept consists of scaffold, cells for scaffold seeding, and a subsequent remodeling process driven by cell accumulation and proliferation, and/or biochemical and mechanical signaling. Despite rapid progress in the field over the past decade, small-diameter arterial TEVG and TEHV have not been translated into clinical applications successfully. To successfully utilize TEVGs and TEHVs clinically, further elucidation of the mechanisms for TEVG and TEHV remodeling and further translational research outcome evaluations will be required...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{merchant}} ship lost to U-boats was an 866-ton British steamer outbound from Grangemouth to Stavanger with a cargo of coal, iron plate, and oil. [...] {{was stopped by}} the German submarine U-17 on 20 October 1914; and a boarding party gave Glitra's crew time to disembark into lifeboats before sinking the ship by opening <b>valves</b> to flood <b>holds</b> with seawater. The procedure followed customs originated by surface ships. International maritime law required the naval vessel to make adequate provisions {{for the safety of}} the merchant crew and passengers before sinking their ship.|$|R
40|$|The {{end section}} of a carbon nanotube, cut by acid treatment, {{contains}} hydrophillic oxygen groups. Water molecules can self-assemble around these groups to seal off a carbon nanotube and form an "aqueous valve". Molecular dynamics simulations on single-wall (12, 12) and (15, 15) tubes with dangling carboxyl groups show that the formation of aqueous valves can be achieved both {{in the absence of}} and in the presence of high pressure hydrogen. Furthermore, significant diffusion barriers through aqueous valves are identified. It indicates that such <b>valves</b> could <b>hold</b> hydrogen inside the tube with GPa pressure. Releasing hydrogen is easily achieved by melting the "aqueous valve". Such a design provides a recyclable and non- destructive way to store hydrogen in GPa pressure. Under the storage conditions dictated by sealing off the container in liquid water, the hydrogen density inside the container is higher than that for solid hydrogen, which promises excellent weight storage efficiency.

50|$|Plants in {{the genus}} Beaufortia, {{sometimes}} {{commonly known as}} bottlebrush are evergreen shrubs with very small, glandular, aromatic leaves usually oppositely arranged. The tallest are up to 3 m in height. Most are andromonoecious, meaning they have both male and bisexual flowers on one plant. The flowers are in spikelike or headlike inflorescences. The flower has five triangular sepals and five white, yellow, red, pink, or purple petals, which are sometimes hairy. The petals usually fall off as the flower opens, or shortly after that. The stamens are red or deep pink, arranged in five bundles and extend well beyond the petals, giving the inflorescence its colour. Unlike other closely related genera such as Melaleuca, the anthers {{are attached to the}} filament at their base and release their pollen through two curved slits on the other end. Flowering in most species occurs throughout the year but mostly between late spring and autumn. The fruit is a dehiscent capsule with three <b>valves,</b> each <b>holding</b> a winged seed.|$|R
