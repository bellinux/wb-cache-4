50|$|In geophysics, <b>vertical</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>profile</b> (VSP) is a {{technique}} of seismic measurements used for correlation with surface seismic data. The defining characteristic of a VSP (of which there are many types) is that either the energy source, or the detectors (or sometimes both) are in a borehole.

50|$|There are {{a number}} of data {{acquisition}} techniques used to generate <b>seismic</b> <b>profiles,</b> all of which involve measuring acoustic waves by means of a source and receivers. These techniques may be further classified into various categories, depending on the configuration and type of sources and receivers used.

5000|$|To {{improve the}} tie between well data and seismic data a [...] "check-shot" [...] survey {{is often used}} to {{generate}} a calibrated sonic log. A geophone, or array of geophones is lowered down the borehole, with a seismic source located at the surface. The seismic source is fired with the geophone(s) at a series of different depths, with the interval transit times being recorded. This is often done during the acquisition of a <b>vertical</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>profile.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{geometry}} of a zero-offset <b>vertical</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>profile</b> (VSP) {{makes it an}} ideal survey to use for the calculation of Q using the spectral ratio method. This {{is because of the}} coincident raypaths that traverse a given rock layer, ensuring that the only path difference between two reflected waves (one {{from the top of the}} interval and one from the bottom) is the interval of interest. Stacked surface seismic reflection traces would offer similar signal-to-noise ratio over a much larger area but cannot be used with this method because every sample represents a different raypath and therefore will have experienced different attenuation effects.|$|E

The performance of such devices is temperature dependent and the level of cooling attained is a function of thermal efficiency.

50|$|There are {{numerous}} methods for acquiring a <b>vertical</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>profile</b> (VSP). Zero-offset VSPs (A) have {{sources close to}} the wellbore directly above receivers. Offset VSPs (B) have sources some distance from the receivers in the wellbore. Walkaway VSPs (C) feature a source that is moved to progressively farther offset and receivers held in a fixed location. Walk-above VSPs (D) accommodate the recording geometry of a deviated well, having each receiver in a different lateral position and the source directly above the receiver. Salt-proximity VSPs (E) are reflection surveys to help define a salt-sediment interface near a wellbore by using a source on top of a salt dome away from the drilling rig. Drill-noise VSPs (F), also known as seismic-while-drilling (SWD) VSPs, use the noise of the drill bit as the source and receivers laid out along the ground.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new genetic-algorithm (GA) inversion technique {{and apply it}} to a <b>vertical</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>profile</b> (VSP) inversion problem where the goal is to recover slowness and impedance profiles. Our algorithm consists of one long (300 gener-ations) and a series of short (50 generations) GA runs. After each run the problem is reparametrized using the matrix of partial second derivatives in a neighbourhood of the best model found in that run. The new unknown parameters are more nearly independent than the old ones, thus successive GA runs find better models faster, in accordance with the principle of meaningful building blocks. For the VSP problem we use a fitness function that is the weighted sum of the cross-correlation between the measured and synthetic total wavefields and the cross-correlation between the measured and synthetic upgoing wavefields. The measured upgoing wavefield is obtained from the measured total wavefield by f- k filtering. Key words: genetic algorithms, inversion, <b>vertical</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>profile</b> (VSP). ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} imaging method {{that creates a}} map of {{reflection}} coefficients in correct one-way time with no contamination from internal multiples using purely a filtering approach. The filter is computed from the measured reflection response and {{does not require a}} background model. We demonstrate that the filter is a focusing wavefield that focuses inside a layered medium and removes all internal multiples between surface and the focus depth. The reflection response and the focusing wavefield can then be used for retrieving virtual <b>vertical</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>profile</b> data, thereby redatuming the source to the focus depth. Deconvolving the upgoing by the downgoing <b>vertical</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>profile</b> data redatums the receiver to the focus depth and gives the desired image. We then show that for oblique angles of incidence in horizontally layered media the image of the same quality as for 1 D waves can be constructed. This step can be followed by a linear operation to determine velocity and density as a function of depth. Numerical simulations show the method can handle finite frequency bandwidth data and the effect of tunneling through thin layers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Various seismic {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to investigate the subsurface in the area around the 2. 2 km deep Lopra- 1 well located on the Faeroe Islands. The techniques include <b>vertical</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>profiling,</b> walk-away <b>vertical</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>profiling</b> and refraction <b>seismic</b> <b>profiling.</b> Integration of these three different techniques, using a combined profiling method, makes it possible to overcome some of the problems arising from the large acoustic impedance contrasts and S-wave scattering which often exist in volcanic areas. The three <b>seismic</b> <b>profiles</b> show distinct compressional (P) and shear (S) energy arrivals. The direct S-wave is generated atbasalt interfaces at or just below the sea bed and interferes in part with groundroll in the refraction recordings. The low noise activity before first arrival indicates the very high quality of the VSP data. The VSP and the walk-away VSP recordings show clear evidence of reflected P-waves, while reflected P-waves are more difficult to recognize on the surface recordings. The velocity through the basalt flows is shown to be dependent on the thickness of the basalt beds. Thick beds yield high velocities, while thin beds generate lower velocities. Velocity anisotropy is observed in the upper 700 m, probably resulting from cracks in th...|$|R

40|$|In <b>vertical</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>profiling</b> tube {{waves are}} {{generally}} classified as noise. They have. however, useful applications: tube waves {{can be generated}} by compressional waves at fluid-filled cracks crossing {{the wall of the}} borehole. In this case the permeability of the fracture zone can be estimated from the amplitude ratio of the incident P wave and the generated tube wave. In the present study an improved model for tube-wave amplitude interpretation is presented. While former models assumed isolated cracks, now, the consideration of fracture zones of a certain porosity, permeability and width is allowed. Master curves are used to check the sensitivity of the amplitude ratio of tube and P waves with respect to the formal parameters of computation. It is shown, moreover, that mainly those parts of a fracture contribute to the tube-wave generation which are within a radius of about 1 m of the borehole. The problem of localization and characterization of fracture zones by tube waves was investigated with several complementary field experiments in shallow boreholes in crystalline rocks as <b>vertical</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>profiling</b> (VSP) with three-component borehole geophones and hydrophones, televiewer measurements, well tests and temperature measurements. It turned out that fracture zones were met at all depths where tube waves were generated. However, not all of them were found to be hydraulically activated during well tests and temperature measurements. This means that fractures detected by tube-wave VSP are not necessarily of hydrological importance. Transmissivity values based on tube-wave analysis are, therefore, an upper limit for the well under consideration. On the other hand, the transmissivity values derived from the well tests agreed quite well with those of the tube-wave analysis if only the 'open' fracture zones were considered: a fact which seems to confirm our theoretical model. Key words: aquifer transmissivity, fracture zones, permeability, tube waves, <b>vertical</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>profiling</b> (VSP) ...|$|R
