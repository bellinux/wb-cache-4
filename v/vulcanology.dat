It was impossible to lie in one position all the time; and whenever I turned, or even moved, my leg gave me the most excruciating jerks of pain and agony. I was heartily sick now of the crater and all that belonged to it. What on earth, I thought, made me ever take to such a trade as <b>vulcanology?</b> I said to myself {{more than once in}} my despair that henceforth I'd give up volcanoes for ever, and go in for some safe and honest trade--like a light-house-man's or an inspector of mines--for a livelihood.|$|E

He is greeted there by his three childhood friends, Kosmos Kholmogorov (or Kosmos (Kos)/Space), Viktor Pchyolkin (Pchyola/Bee), and Valery Filatov (Fil/Phil). His return, however, shows that perestroika has deeply transformed the Soviet Union life and both Kosmos and Pchyola have turned to criminal racket on Moscow's markets. They try to lure Sasha to join them, but Belov abruptly refuses and instead has ambitions to attain higher education in <b>vulcanology.</b>|$|E
5000|$|On Tuesday, 23 November 2010, 16.30 WIB (Western Indonesian Time), the Indonesian Centre of <b>Vulcanology</b> and Geology Hazard Mitigation (CVGHM) {{confirmed}} the activity status of Mount Bromo at [...] "alert" [...] due to increasing tremor activity and shallow volcanic earthquakes at the mountain. Concerns were raised that a volcanic eruption might {{be likely to}} occur. As a precaution local residents and tourists were instructed to remain clear of an area within a radius of three kilometres from the caldera and refugee encampments were erected. The area surrounding the Teggera caldera of Bromo remained off-limits for visitors throughout the remainder of 2010.|$|E
50|$|A subplot {{concerning}} Rogier Verbeek (played by Kevin McMonagle), a Dutch geologist who had {{surveyed the}} area {{two years earlier}} and laid the basis for modern <b>vulcanology</b> with his research after the eruption, adds a scientific touch and a helpful map to the computer-generated imagery that convincingly portrays the ash cloud, collapse of the stratovolcano, pyroclastic flows, and tsunamis. The eruption column collapsing sends a big pyroclastic flow over the Sunda Strait coast of Sumatra.The film also portrays a family trying to escape the devastating volcano, and a ship with more than 100 passengers trapped at sea when the final collapse of Krakatoa island {{at the end of}} the eruption generates a massive tsunami.|$|E

A lower crater lies just above sea level near the small village of Pollara, on the north west corner of the island, half of which has fallen into the sea.|$|E
5000|$|Naumann {{arrived in}} Japan just {{one month before}} his twenty-fifth birthday, {{receiving}} a yearly salary of 3600 yen. Overall, he spent ten years in Japan, and wrote numerous scientific papers, most of which remain untranslated from the original German. During his early years in Japan, he both cooperated with, and competed against, fellow geologist John Milne. Both {{were part of the}} European scientific community interested in exploring the origins of the earth and the fledgling science of <b>vulcanology.</b> In 1877, Naumann and Milne investigated a volcanic eruption on the island of Izu Ōshima near Tokyo. However, by the 1880s, Milne focused more on seismology, whereas Naumann concentrated on his attempts to complete a geological map of the Japanese archipelago.|$|E
5000|$|An avid {{traveller}} {{for much}} of his life, Clark held a longtime interest in the Galapagos Islands, culminating in a residency on San Cristobal Island beginning in the summer of 2005. Invited by the Galapagos Marine Ecology team at the University of Arizona, Tucson, Clark, along with a group of 12 secondary and post-secondary teachers, worked with residents of several island communities to teach English to local school children. Clark and Karen Ford-Manza Tompson, former Executive Director of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill in Kansas and current Executive Director at Arizona Family Planning Council, co-authored a work regarding tectonic plate movement which was later reviewed by Rice University Staff (Linked below) The paper was entitled [...] "The Geology and <b>Vulcanology</b> of the Galapagos Islands".|$|E
5000|$|Polar Sea has {{a variety}} of {{missions}} while operating in polar regions. During Antarctic deployments, the primary missions include breaking a channel through the sea ice to resupply the McMurdo Station in the Ross Sea. Resupply ships use the channel to bring food, fuel, and other goods to make it through another winter. In addition to these duties, Polar Sea also serves as a scientific research platform with five laboratories, additional space for seven portable laboratories on deck and accommodations for up to 35 scientists. The [...] "J"-shaped cranes and work areas near the stern and port side of ship give scientists the capability to do at-sea studies in the fields of geology, <b>vulcanology,</b> oceanography, sea-ice physics and other disciplines.|$|E
50|$|He {{also participated}} during 1892 in the Second National Congress of Pedagology and the National Congress of Spanish-Portuguese-American Geography. At these he {{presented}} papers on women's education and Spanish colonialism respectively, {{the latter of}} which he compared in its development with Anglo-Saxon colonialism in California. He was commissioned by the Ministry of War to travel in Italy and Austria-Hungary, where he visited various schools of geography; from these he collected much important information, allowing him to undertake his “Memoria sobre el progreso de los trabajos geográficos” on the Progress of Geographical Work which, {{until his death in}} 1904, he edited for the Bulletin of the Sociedad Geográfica de Madrid, in his capacity as Secretary general. In it these he presented the latest developments in geographical knowledge and in its diverse specialist fields of <b>vulcanology,</b> seismics, glaciology and oceanology.|$|E

5000|$|The use {{of fossil}} pollen (palynology) {{to date the}} {{stratigraphy}} of Quaternary deposits, {{was one of his}} main interests. He introduced the discipline of palynology to South Africa in a 1951 article in the [...] "South African Archaeological Bulletin". He stressed that global temperature variations were the primary cause of profound environmental changes, and that a study of fossil pollen would produce a wealth of information about palaeoenvironments.In this regard he worked at several sites in southern and eastern Africa with J. Desmond Clark, extending the scope of his research to include the Sahara and Namib deserts and the sub-Antarctic islands of Prince Edward and Marion. In 1965 he arranged the first major research expedition to these islands made up of an international team of 35 specialists who studied palynology, glacial geology, <b>vulcanology,</b> limnology, mineral cycling and bio-energetics. The results were published in a 1971 monograph.|$|E
