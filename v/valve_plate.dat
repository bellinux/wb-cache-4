5000|$|Reciprocating pistons. As the {{cylinder}} block rotates, the exposed {{ends of the}} pistons are constrained to follow {{the surface of the}} cam plane. Since the cam plane is at an angle to the axis of rotation, the pistons must reciprocate axially as they precess about {{the cylinder}} block axis. The axial motion of the pistons is sinusoidal. During the rising portion of the piston's reciprocation cycle, the piston moves toward the <b>valve</b> <b>plate.</b> Also, during this time, the fluid trapped between the buried end of the piston and the <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> is vented to the pump's discharge port through one of the valve plate's semi-circular ports - the discharge port. As the piston moves toward the <b>valve</b> <b>plate,</b> fluid is pushed or displaced through the discharge port of the <b>valve</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

50|$|Effect of precession. When {{the piston}} {{is at the}} top of the {{reciprocation}} cycle (commonly referred to as top-dead-center or just TDC), the connection between the trapped fluid chamber and the pump's discharge port is closed. Shortly thereafter, that same chamber becomes open to the pump's inlet port. As the piston continues to precess about the cylinder block axis, it moves away from the <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> thereby increasing the volume of the trapped chamber. As this occurs, fluid enters the chamber from the pump's inlet to fill the void. This process continues until the piston reaches the bottom of the reciprocation cylinder - commonly referred to as bottom-dead-center or BDC. At BDC, the connection between the pumping chamber and inlet port is closed. Shortly thereafter, the chamber becomes open to the discharge port again and the pumping cycle starts over.|$|E

Coated <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> and bronze <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> showed a steady state of friction coefficient at approximately 0. 03 and 0. 06, respectively after about 1000 rpm, but steel <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> without coating showed a continuous decrease in friction coefficient, which suggested that active wear is continuously occurring. By applying CrZrN coating on the commercial cylinder barrel and steel <b>valve</b> <b>plate,</b> much improved tribological results could be obtained, by a factor of approximately 2 in terms of friction coefficient than those from bronze <b>valve</b> <b>plate.</b> Under a tap water environment CrZrN coating appeared to perform better than CrSiN coating.

Based on FLUENT module of ANSYS Workbench, as well as standard k-ε turbulence model and DPM model, simulation analysis of the influence of 3 inlet pressures (0. 25, 0. 30, 0. 35) of working medium (N 2) in dust removal system and 2 different <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> jaw openings (45 °, 90 °) on the dust deposition trajectory in butterfly valve region are conducted, and the influence mechanism of inlet pressure on the dust deposition is analyzed.

30|$|Current {{researches}} mainly {{focus on}} the investigations of the <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> utilizing pressure relief grooves. However, air-release and cavitation can occur near the grooves. The <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> utilizing damping holes show excellent performance in avoiding air-release and cavitation. This study aims to reduce the noise emitted from an axial piston pump using a novel <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> utilizing damping holes. A dynamic pump model is developed, in which the fluid properties are carefully modeled to capture the phenomena of air release and cavitation. The causes of different noise sources are investigated using the model. A comprehensive parametric analysis is conducted to enhance {{the understanding of the}} effects of the <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> parameters on the noise sources. A multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization method is proposed to optimize the parameters of <b>valve</b> <b>plate.</b> The amplitudes of the swash plate moment and flow rates in the inlet and outlet ports are defined as the objective functions. The pressure overshoot and undershoot in the piston chamber are limited by properly constraining the highest and lowest pressure values. A comparison of the various noise sources between the original and optimized designs over a wide range of pressure levels shows that the noise sources are reduced at high pressures. The results of the sound pressure level measurements show that the optimized <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> reduces the noise level by 1.6  dB(A) at the rated working condition. The proposed method is effective in reducing the noise of axial piston pumps and contributes to the development of quieter axial piston machines.|$|E

40|$|Axial piston {{machines}} {{are widely used}} in many industries for their designs compactness, flexibility in power transfer, variable flow rate, and high efficiencies as compared to their manufacturing costs. One important component of all axial piston machines {{that is a very}} influential on the performance of the unit is the <b>valve</b> <b>plate.</b> The aim of this research is to develop a design methodology that is general enough to design all types of valve plates and the simple enough not to require advanced technical knowledge from the user. A new style of <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> designs has been developed that comprehensively considers all previous design techniques and does not require significant changes to the manufacturing processes of valve plates. The design methodology utilizes a previously developed accurate computer model of the physical phenomenon. This allows the precise optimization of the <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> design through the use of simulations rather than expensive trial and error processes. The design of the <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> is clarified into the form of an optimization problem.

For the case of a large side gap, the pressure over the <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> becomes nearly uniform and is equal to the upstream one. And that the fluid force is expressed as a function of only the velocity ratio of the jet to the upstream, if the side-gap-leakage is less than the mainflow volume. It is pointed out that the separation zone at the back of a <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> is recovered very rapidly due to momentum transfer effects of side-gap-leakage, and that the outlet flow from a <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> is not contracted with its width nearly equal to the valve opening one.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{fundamentals}} for fabrication of stepped microstructures from fluorinated polymers using the LIGA technique are discussed. By means of these developments, {{applicability of the}} LIGA technique has been enhanced considerably. The process developed to fabricate micropatterned molding tools for plastic molding of LIGA microstructures with two or more level heights is described. A first single-step LIGA molding tool is used to structure a modified resist layer by plastic molding. This pre-structured resist layer is then structured by deep-etch X-ray lithography and subsequently used as a negative mold for electroforming of the stepped molding tool. Using this molding tool LIGA microstructures with a real three-dimensional shape have been produced by plastic molding. The essential developments are shown. In LIGA technique, PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) is the molding material preferred for plastic molding. However, many applications, especially in medical and environmental technologies, require materials with high chemical and thermal stability. Especially for this, fluorinated polymers are well suited but could not be microstructured by the LIGA process so far. Therefore the process of vacuum hot embossing of microstructures from PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) was developed. The potentials of both developments are demonstrated by the example of molded stepped micro <b>valve</b> <b>plates</b> of PMMA and PVDF. These micro <b>valve</b> <b>plates</b> were built in miniaturized valves and tested successfully. (orig.) Dissertation submitted by H.
