5|$|The Relapse, or, <b>Virtue</b> <b>in</b> Danger is a Restoration comedy from 1696 {{written by}} John Vanbrugh. The play is {{a sequel to}} Colley Cibber's Love's Last Shift, or, The Fool in Fashion.|$|E
5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} {{the differences between}} men and women as much as she emphasizes the importance of <b>virtue</b> <b>in</b> Original Stories. Moreover, she defines <b>virtue</b> <b>in</b> such a way that it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should be characterized by reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason’s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of their gender.|$|E
5|$|Love in Several Masques is a play by Henry Fielding {{that was}} first {{performed}} on 16 February 1728 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. The moderately received play comically depicts three lovers trying {{to pursue their}} individual beloveds. The beloveds require their lovers to meet their various demands, {{which serves as a}} means for Fielding to introduce his personal feelings on morality and <b>virtue.</b> <b>In</b> addition, Fielding introduces criticism of women and society in general.|$|E

5|$|For Lord Charlemont, Hogarth {{chose to}} paint the satirical Piquet, or <b>Virtue</b> <b>in</b> Danger (also known as The Lady's Last Stake, after a 1708 play by Colley Cibber), which, with echoes of Marriage à-la-Mode, shows an army officer {{offering}} an aristocratic lady a chance to recover the fortune she has just lost by gambling (with the implication that if she loses again, {{she will have to}} take him as her lover). After Grosvenor saw this painting in Hogarth's studio in 1758, he asked Hogarth to paint a picture for him as well, under the same terms.|$|E

5|$|The less-prominent women {{mentioned}} in the play are subordinated as well, as they are only described through {{the men of the}} play. Most of what is said about Sycorax, for example, is said by Prospero. Further, Stephen Orgel notes that Prospero has never met Sycorax – all he learned about her he learned from Ariel. According to Orgel, Prospero's suspicion of women makes him an unreliable source of information. Orgel suggests that he is sceptical of female <b>virtue</b> <b>in</b> general, citing his ambiguous remark about his wife's fidelity.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other Sophists, such as Protagoras, Gorgias did not {{profess to}} teach arete (excellence, or, virtue). He {{believed}} {{that there was no}} absolute form of arete, but that it was relative to each situation. For example, <b>virtue</b> <b>in</b> a slave was not the same as <b>virtue</b> <b>in</b> a statesman. His believed that rhetoric, the art of persuasion, was the king of all sciences, since he saw it as a techné with which one could persuade an audience toward any course of action. While rhetoric existed in the curriculum of every Sophist, Gorgias placed more prominence upon it than any of the others.|$|E
