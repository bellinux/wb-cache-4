25|$|The {{replaceable}} {{models of}} implantable heart valve prostheses are typically supplied with a sewing or suturing ring surrounding the <b>valve</b> <b>body</b> or stent {{that is to}} be sutured by the surgeon to the valvar rim.|$|E
25|$|The biggest {{challenge}} {{in this type}} of prostheses is the difficulty in its future removal. This is due to the formation of pannus fibrotic around the <b>valve</b> <b>body</b> and sewing ring. To separate the parts is very laborious, keeping intact the sewing ring, which will be used in the coupling of the new valve.|$|E
25|$|A Schrader valve {{consists}} of a hollow cylindrical metal tube, typically brass, with the exterior end threaded. The interior end takes {{a variety of forms}} depending on its application. In the center of the exterior end is a metal pin pointing along the axis of the tube; the pin's end is flush {{with the end of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>body.</b> Generally, all Schrader valves are used on tires. They have threads and bodies of a single standard size at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are universal for the valves on all automobile and bicycle pneumatic tires. Also, pressure valves can be used on Schrader valves in place of caps in order to measure the pressure of pneumatic tires. In 1891, George Schrader, the son of German-American immigrant August Schrader, invented the Schrader valve. A patent was issued on April 11, 1893.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{variant of}} form-milling {{involves}} holding the cutter's axis orthogonally (no canting to the thread's helix angle) and feeding the cutter in a toolpath that will generate the thread. The part {{is usually a}} stationary workpiece, such as a boss on a <b>valve</b> <b>body</b> (in external thread milling) or a hole in a plate or block (in internal thread milling). This type of thread milling uses essentially the same concept as contouring with an endmill or ball-nose mill, but the cutter and toolpath are arranged specifically to define the [...] "contour" [...] of a thread. The toolpath is achieved either using helical interpolation (which is circular interpolation in one plane [...] with simultaneous linear interpolation along a third axis the CNC control model must be one that supports using the third axis) or a simulation of it using extremely small increments of 3-axes linear interpolation (which is not practical to program manually but can be programmed easily with CAD/CAM software). The cutter geometry reflects the thread pitch but not its lead; the lead (thread helix angle) {{is determined by the}} toolpath. Tapered threads can be cut either with a tapered multiple-form cutter that completes the thread in one revolution using helical interpolation, or with a straight or tapered cutter (of single- or multiple-form) whose toolpath is one or more revolutions but cannot use helical interpolation and must use CAD/CAM software to generate a contour-like simulation of helical interpolation.|$|E
50|$|A bonnet {{acts as a}} {{cover on}} the <b>valve</b> <b>body.</b> It is {{commonly}} semi-permanently screwed into the <b>valve</b> <b>body</b> or bolted onto it. During manufacture of the valve, the internal parts are put into the body and then the bonnet is attached to hold everything together inside. To access internal parts of a valve, a user would take off the bonnet, usually for maintenance. Many valves do not have bonnets; for example, plug valves usually do not have bonnets. Many ball valves do not have bonnets since the <b>valve</b> <b>body</b> is put together in a different style, such as being screwed together at {{the middle of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
50|$|The air {{pressure}} in an inflated tire holds the inner <b>valve</b> <b>body</b> shut. A small screw and captive nut {{on the top}} of the <b>valve</b> <b>body</b> permits the valve to be screwed shut and ensure that it remains tightly closed. The nut must be unscrewed to permit airflow in either direction. This must be done before attaching a pump. The screw remains captive on the <b>valve</b> <b>body</b> even when unscrewed fully; it is tightened again after the tire is inflated and the pump removed. The valve cap protects the <b>valve</b> <b>body,</b> keeps dirt and mud out of the mechanism, and also prevents the valve from damaging the tube when it is rolled for storage, but is not necessary to prevent pressure loss.|$|E
50|$|The British {{employed}} pneumatic <b>valve</b> <b>bodies</b> {{to regulate}} gear shifting by charging pistons with compressed air within the gearbox. These pneumatic pistons or gear-levers are activated {{by a series}} of <b>valve</b> <b>bodies</b> and controlled by electronic actuators linked to the gear shifter. As each gear cycle is energized, air valves open and close to engage the corresponding gear-lever. Compressed air is drawn from the braking system and in the event of loss of pressure, the transmission will remain in the last gear selected or if in neutral, will not shift into gear.|$|R
50|$|Examples {{of items}} that are steel {{castings}} include: hydroelectric turbine wheels, forging presses, gears, railroad truck frames, <b>valve</b> <b>bodies,</b> pump casings, mining machinery, marine equipment, turbocharger turbines and engine cylinder blocks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Valve</b> <b>bodies</b> {{are usually}} {{metallic}} or plastic. Brass, bronze, gunmetal, cast iron, steel, alloy steels and stainless steels are very common. Seawater applications, like desalination plants, often use duplex valves, {{as well as}} super duplex valves, due to their corrosion resistant properties, particularly against warm seawater. Alloy 20 valves are typically used in sulphuric acid plants, whilst monel valves are used in hydrofluoric acid (HF Acid) plants. Hastelloy valves are often used in high temperature applications, such as nuclear plants, whilst inconel valves are often used in hydrogen applications. Plastic bodies are used for relatively low pressures and temperatures. PVC, PP, PVDF and glass-reinforced nylon are common plastics used for <b>valve</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|R

50|$|The 41TE {{transmission}} which directly {{replaced the}} Ultradrive {{had a similar}} design and could be considered an evolutionary change, but it included different <b>valve</b> <b>bodies,</b> solenoid packs, sensors, and other components to increase reliability. This line was also given a flash-programmable TCM and, in 2006, a variable line pressure hydraulic system was phased in, which boosted performance and longevity.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{electronic}} {{automatic transmissions}} have electrical solenoids which are activated to change gears. Simple electronic-control designs (such as Ford's AOD-E, AXOD-E and E4OD) use the solenoids {{to modify the}} shift points in an existing <b>valve</b> <b>body,</b> while more advanced designs (such as the Chrysler Ultradrive and its follow-ons) use the solenoids to control the clutches indirectly, {{by way of a}} greatly simplified <b>valve</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

40|$|Monitoring the {{structural}} health of large <b>valve</b> <b>bodies</b> in high-temperature environments such as power plants faces several limitations: commercial transducers are not rated for such high-temperatures, gel couplants will evaporate, and measurements cannot be made in-situ. To solve this, we have furthered {{the work of}} Barrow and Kobayashi in applying a transducer in liquid form by making it more field-deployable; the sintering step is removed, the fabrication time is reduced, and the signal-to-noise ratio is improved using post-processing techniques. Bismuth Titanate (BiT) {{was used as the}} piezoelectric material for its high Curie temperature, and three separate chemical binders were demonstrated to work: sol-gel, potato starch, and a proprietary high-temperature inorganic binder (IB). The pros and cons of each chemical binder are compared with respect to substrate compatibility, stable operating temperature, and fabrication time. The BiT/IB combination is highlighted for its compatibility on both reactive and non-reactive substrates, stable operating temperature of 330 oC, and quick fabrication time making it ideal for in-situ monitoring of large <b>valve</b> <b>bodies...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} {{is very popular}} in the sport of drag racing today, with units equipped with manual <b>valve</b> <b>bodies</b> and transbrakes, {{some of which are}} air shifted. It is also widely used in off-road applications due to its reputation of being nearly indestructible. It does, however, have a reputation of greatly reducing performance as well as fuel mileage, due to the amount of power it requires to operate.|$|R

50|$|Bell metal is a {{hard alloy}} used for making bells and related instruments, such as cymbals. It {{is a form of}} bronze with a higher tin content, usually in {{approximately}} a 4:1 ratio of copper to tin (typically, 78% copper, 22% tin by mass). The higher tin content increases the rigidity of the metal, and increases the resonance. It also has industrial uses, being specified for <b>valve</b> <b>bodies,</b> piston rings, bearings, and bushings.|$|R
5000|$|Aluminum alloy {{castings}} traditionally {{have been used}} in nonstructural airplane hardware, such as pulley brackets, quadrants, doublers, clips, ducts, and wave guides.

Redundancy in cable and hydraulic control systems [...] "permits" [...] the use of castings.|$|R
50|$|The Fordomatic {{two-speed}} transmission {{was introduced}} in 1959. A simplified version of the Cruise-O-Matic, it combined a torque connector and a compound planetary gear set. A front unit (multiple-disc) clutch provided high gear, a front band on the clutch drum provided low gear, and a band on the rear unit internal gear drum provided reverse. This transmission was offered on Ford, Fairlane, Mercury, Edsel, Falcon, Comet and Meteor cars with differences in the torque converter, <b>valve</b> <b>bodies</b> and clutch plates to accommodate differing engine torques.|$|R

50|$|Internally {{the fixed}} <b>valve</b> <b>body</b> is {{constructed}} as a cylinder, with the moving {{part of the}} valve within this as a piston. The conical valve {{is part of this}} piston. The piston is double-acting and splits the internal <b>valve</b> <b>body</b> in two, with water pressure on both sides. The upper side of the piston is larger, the full diameter of the piston, and is supplied with water through a throttling valve; normally adjusted and then left in position. The lower side of the piston is an annular space surrounding the moving <b>valve</b> <b>body</b> and maintained at the lower (Bernoulli) water pressure. The tip of the conical valve contains a small pilot valve, linking the upper chamber of the valve to the downstream drain below the valve. This pilot valve is controlled mechanically from outside the valve chamber and is the main control over the valve position.|$|E
50|$|If the <b>valve</b> <b>body</b> {{is filled}} with water, the float moves upwards and closes the valve. If air {{collects}} in the <b>valve</b> <b>body,</b> the waterline lowers, as does the float, and the valve opens to release it. To give more sealing force on the valve, the float generally works the valve through a lever. A greater movement of the float gives a shorter, but more forceful, movement of the valve. This lever mechanism may be simply, almost crudely, made of a pressed steel strip which acts as a bending hinge.|$|E
