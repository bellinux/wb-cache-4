The effects of various design and operating parameters on the thermal behavior of <b>VRLA</b> <b>batteries</b> are investigated.

50|$|The high DC-DC {{efficiency}} of UltraBattery is achievable because (like conventional <b>VRLA</b> <b>batteries)</b> it operates very efficiently below 80% SoC. Experiments indicate that for <b>VRLA</b> <b>batteries</b> “from zero SOC to 84% SOC the average overall battery charging efficiency is 91%”. While conventional <b>VRLA</b> <b>batteries</b> cannot tolerate {{working in this}} range for any significant length of time without frequent refreshing, UltraBattery can tolerate working at much lower states of charge without significant degradation. Hence it can achieve much greater efficiencies since it can operate for long periods in the most efficient zone for lead acid batteries.|$|R

After 430 days of cycling, the East Penn UltraBattery and Furukawa UltraBattery still had not failed. The East Penn Battery was maintaining 85% of its initial capacity and the Furukawa battery was at very close to 100% of its initial capacity.|$|E

UltraBatteries have performance far surpassing traditional <b>VRLA</b> <b>batteries</b> even when the traditional <b>VRLA</b> <b>batteries</b> are operating on only 7 day deficit charge regimes. In a deficit charge regime there is no recovery by taper charge, also known as refreshing/equalization of the batteries so sulfation is a typical failure mode for conventional VRLAs in this operating regime.|$|R

Using a high-rate, partial state-of-charge cycling profile at the 1C1 to 4C1 rate, the UltraBattery was capable of more than 15,000 cycles with less than 20% capacity loss, and could cycle at the 4C1 rate. An absorbed glass matt (AGM) <b>VRLA</b> <b>battery</b> tested under the same conditions could only cycle at the 1C1 rate, required a recovery charge after about 100 cycles, and after 1100 cycles lost more than 20% of its capacity.

40|$|Some {{factors that}} make {{batteries}} suitable for commercially viable electric vehicles (EVs) are battery performance, cost, and life.

With funding from the Advanced Lead-Acid Battery Consortium, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has worked with Recombination Technologies and Optima Batteries Inc., to improve the cycle life of <b>VRLA</b> <b>batteries,</b> which is strongly influenced by the way they are charged over their lifetime. The purpose of the project was to develop charge algorithms specifically aimed at improving the cycle life of <b>VRLA</b> <b>batteries</b> to 1000 deep discharges for electric vehicle applications. The motivation for the project was based on the hypothesis that <b>VRLA</b> <b>batteries</b> reach end-of-life prematurely with the “normal ” constant voltage charge because of insufficient recharge at the negative plate and the “oxygen cycle” or recombination reactions interfering with recharge of the negative plate.

50|$|Simple AC-powered battery {{chargers}} usually have much higher ripple current and ripple voltage than {{other kinds of}} {{battery chargers}} because they are inexpensively designed and built. Generally, when the ripple current is within a battery's manufacturer recommended level, the ripple voltage will also be well within the recommended level.The maximum ripple current for a typical 12 V 100 Ah VRLA lead acid battery is 5 amps.As long as the ripple current is not excessive (more than 3 to 4 times the battery manufacturer recommended level), the expected life of a ripple-charged <b>VRLA</b> <b>battery</b> will be within 3% {{of the life of}} a constant DC-charged battery.|$|E
50|$|Combining the two {{technologies}} in one battery cell means that UltraBattery works very efficiently compared with conventional lead acid technologies {{largely due to}} the fact that it can be operated for long periods in a partial state of charge (pSoC), whereas conventional lead acid batteries are more typically designed for high SoC use (i.e. when the battery is close to fully charged). Operating in the partial SoC range extends the battery’s life chiefly by reducing sulfation and by reducing time spent operating at very high and very low states of charge, where various side reactions tend to cause deterioration. A conventional <b>VRLA</b> <b>battery</b> tends to deteriorate quickly when operated in this partial SoC range.|$|E
