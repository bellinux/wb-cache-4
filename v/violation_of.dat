40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{tested a}} proposal that hierarchically and par-tially restrictive trait dimensions pertaining to morality {{can be explained by}} Kant’s distinction between perfect and imperfect duties. Consistent with the proposal, Experiment 1 demonstrated that people change their positive expectancies about others at a faster rate in response to <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> perfect than imperfect duties. In addition, however, Experiment 2 showed that situa-tional factors mitigate the negative trait attributions resulting from <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> imperfect duties more than those resulting from <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> perfect duties. Experiment 3 demonstrated that differences in trait attributions as a result <b>of</b> <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> perfect or imperfect duties are not due to implications of these vio-lations for future behavior.
