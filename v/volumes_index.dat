40|$|Abstract — We {{describe}} {{a system for}} interactively rendering isosurfaces of tetrahedral finite-element scalar fields using coherent ray tracing techniques on the CPU. By employing state-of-the art methods in polygonal ray tracing, namely aggressive packet/frustum traversal of a bounding volume hierarchy, we can accomodate large and time-varying unstructured volume data. In conjunction with this efficiency structure, we introduce a novel technique for intersecting ray packets with tetrahedral primitives. Ray tracing is flexible, allowing for dynamic changes in isovalue and time step, visualization of multiple isosurfaces, shadows, and depth-peeling transparency effects. The resulting system offers the intuitive simplicity of isosurfacing, guaranteed-correct visual results, and ultimately a scalable, dynamic and consistently interactive solution for visualizing unstructured <b>volumes.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Ray Tracing, Isosurfaces, Unstructured meshes, Tetrahedra, Scalar Fields, Time-varying data. ...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveLeft {{ventricular}} {{end-diastolic volume}} is decreased and ejection fraction is increased after surgical ventricular reconstruction; however, {{the impact on}} left ventricular stroke volume is not well established. MethodsWe analyzed 248 consecutive patients who underwent surgical ventricular reconstruction at a single center. There were 14 perioperative deaths (5. 6 %). The 234 surviving patients had pre- and postsurgical ventricular reconstruction echocardiographic measurement of end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and stroke <b>volume,</b> each <b>indexed</b> to body size and ejection fraction. A total of 120 patients had echocardiography data at follow-up (median 8 months). ResultsOverall, surgical ventricular reconstruction resulted in reductions in end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (– 30 % ± 18 %) and end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (– 37 % ± 20 %), and increases in ejection fraction (21 % ± 18 % relative increase). However, stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> decreased from 35 ± 8 mL/m 2 preoperatively to 28 ± 7 mL/m 2 early postoperatively (a 17 % ± 24 % relative reduction, P < . 0001); 165 patients (71 %) exhibited a decrease and 69  patients (29 %) exhibited an increase or no change in stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> after surgical ventricular reconstruction. Stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> reduction was strictly related to end-diastolic volume reduction. Patients who initially had a stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> decrease showed recovery, so {{that at the time}} of chronic follow-up there was no significant difference between the groups. Notably, 4 -year survival was approximately 85 % and did not differ between patients with an increase or decrease in stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (P = . 383). ConclusionsAlthough surgical ventricular reconstruction uniformly results in an impressive decrease in end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> and increase in ejection fraction, seemingly indicating beneficial remodeling and improved pump function, systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> which more directly indexes cardiac pump function, frequently decreases after surgical ventricular reconstruction.

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{sequential}} changes in left ventricular volume after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, gated radionuclide ventriculography was performed within 12 hours of thrombolysis and at 1 and 6 weeks in 34 consecutive {{patients who received}} intravenous thrombolytic therapy in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Trial. Angiographic confirmation of immediate reperfusion (mean 5. 6 hours after onset of symptoms) that persisted at 24 hours was noted in 24 patients; 10 patients were not reperfused. A small (9. 5 %), but significant (p = 0. 05), increase in end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> was noted in the reperfused group between 1 and 6 weeks; however, a marked degree of dilatation (35 %) was noted in the nonreperfused group (p = 0. 01). The change in left ventricular volume between 1 and 6 weeks differed in the 2 groups for both end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> and end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (p = 0. 01 and p = 0. 02, respectively). By 6 weeks, both end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> and end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> were greater in the nonreperfused group (p < 0. 05). Between the acute and 6 -week studies, definite increases in end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (p < 0. 05) and end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (p < 0. 01) occurred commonly in the nonreperfused group but rarely in the reperfused group. Compared to the nonreperfused group, the reperfused group also had significantly higher ejection fractions at both 1 and 6 weeks (p < 0. 05). The change in end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> between 1 and 6 weeks correlated significantly and inversely with the ejection fraction at 1 week (r = - 0. 60, p < 0. 001). These results indicate that ventricular dilatation occurs between 1 and 6 weeks after myocardial infarction, is proportional to systolic dysfunction and may be largely prevented by successful thrombolytic reperfusion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Large {{scale and}} {{structurally}} complex volume datasets from high-resolution 3 D imaging devices or computational simulations pose {{a number of}} technical challenges for interactive visual analysis. In this paper, we present the first integration of a multiscale volume representation based on tensor approximation within a GPU-accelerated out-of-core multiresolution rendering framework. Specific contributions include (a) a hierarchical brick-tensor decomposition approach for pre-processing large volume data, (b) a GPU accelerated tensor reconstruction implementation exploiting CUDA capabilities, and (c) an effective tensor-specific quantization strategy for reducing data transfer bandwidth and out-of-core memory footprint. Our multiscale representation allows for the extraction, analysis and display of structural features at variable spatial scales, while adaptive level-of-detail rendering methods {{make it possible to}} interactively explore large datasets within a constrained memory footprint.

40|$|Q-ball imaging (QBI) {{is a high}} angular {{resolution}} diffusion imaging (HARDI) technique which has been proven very successful in resolving multiple intravoxel fiber orientations in MR images. The standard computation of the orientation distribution function (ODF, the probability of diffusion in a given direction) from q-ball uses linear radial projection, neglecting {{the change in the}} volume element along the ray, thereby resulting in distributions different from the true ODFs. For instance, they are not normalized or as sharp as expected, and generally require post-processing, such as sharpening or spherical deconvolution. In this paper, we consider the mathematically correct definition of the ODF and derive a closed-form expression for it in QBI. The derived ODF is dimensionless and normalized, and can be efficiently computed from q-ball acquisition protocols.

40|$|Abstract—Intensity based rigid {{registration}} algorithms commonly {{employed for}} medical image fusion {{are based on}} the iterative optimization of a pixel-by-pixel distance measure defined on the images. As medical images grow larger in size due to advanced scanner technology, evaluating such similarity measures is no longer computationally efficient. In order to overcome the inherent limitations of the standard approach we propose a new, nonlinear projection scheme that enables a very fast evaluation of the distance between two images. Current state-of-the-art projection schemes decompose a six dimensional search space into three dimensional subspaces. The proposed approach, however, yields a complete decomposition into 1 D subspaces. The optimization on these subspaces is highly efficient and does not require a reprojection. This scheme is therefore suitable for 2 D and 3 D registrations, and it is able to cope with subvolume matching problems. Furthermore, the use of modern graphics hardware allows for a highly efficient implementation. Experiments show that computation times can be reduced to less than 10 seconds with the proposed approach for 256 3 sized <b>volumes.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—rigid registration, fusion, projection, optimizatio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Deadline-driven {{bulk data}} {{transfers}} frequently occur in overlay networks running data-intensive, distributed workflow applications, such as grid and cloud environments. What distinguishes such transfers from other Internet traffic is that overlay nodes should cooperate towards the common goal of delivering all inter-dependent data timely, rather than follow individual, selfish goals. For such scenarios, we propose scheduling transfers in overlays in a globally optimal manner {{with respect to}} minimizing overall network congestion. Our optimization jointly addresses routing of transfers within the overlay and the time-domain scheduling of transfer bandwidths. We formally define and address the associated problem, the Bulk Data Routing and Transfer(BDRT) and present a linear programming-based solution to it, optimal in both routing and time domains. We additionally explore alternative approaches based on heuristic routing strategies, both oblivious and time-domain optimized. We evaluate these solutions via both PlanetLab trace-driven simulations and Internet transfer experiments, on the Intrigger wide-area grid and PlanetLab. Evaluation shows that our approach finds optimal solutions, based on estimations of job arrival times, deadlines and transfer <b>volumes.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—congestion minimization, deadline-driven transfers, routing overlays, Interne...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper shows new resutls of our {{artificial}} evolution algorithm for {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) reconstruction. This imaging technique produces datasets cor-responding to the concentration of positron emitters within the patient. Fully three-dimensional (3 D) tomographic reconstruction requires high computing power and leads to many challenges. Our aim is to produce high quality datasets in a time that is clin-ically acceptable. Our method {{is based on a}} co-evolution strategy called the “Fly algorithm”. Each fly represents a point in space and mimics a positron emitter. Each fly position is progressively optimised using evolutionary computing to closely match the data measured by the imaging system. The performance of each fly is assessed based on its positive or negative contribution to the performance of the whole population. The final population of flies approximates the radioactivity concentration. This approach has shown promising results on numerical phantom models. The size of objects and their relative concentrations can be calculated in two-dimensional (2 D) space. In 3 D, complex shapes can be reconstructed. In this paper, we demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to fidely reconstruct more anatomically realistic <b>volumes.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Evolutionary computation, inverse problems, adaptive algorithm, Nuclear medicine, Positron emission tomog...|$|E
40|$|AbstractÐIn this paper, {{we propose}} new {{algorithms}} for accurate nonrigid motion tracking. Given an initial model representing general {{knowledge of the}} object, a set of sparse correspondences, and incomplete or missing information about geometry or material properties, we can recover dense motion vectors using finite element models. The method {{is based on the}} iterative analysis {{of the differences between the}} actual and predicted behavior. Large differences indicate that an object's properties are not captured properly by the model describing it. Feedback from the images during the motion allows the refinement of the model by minimizing the error between the expected and true position of the object's points. These errors are due to flaws in the model parameter estimation such as geometry and material properties. Unknown parameters are recovered using an iterative descent search for the best nonlinear finite element model that approximates nonrigid motion of the given object. During this search process, we not only estimate material properties, but also infer dense point correspondences from our initial set of sparse correspondences. Thus, during tracking, the model is refined which, in turn, improves tracking quality. As a result, we obtain a more precise description of nonrigid motion. Experimental results demonstrate the success of the proposed algorithm. The method was applied to man-made elastic materials and human skin to recover unknown elasticity, to complex 3 D objects to find details of their geometry, and to a hand motion analysis application. Our work demonstrates the possibility of accurate quantitative analysis of nonrigid motion in range image sequences with objects consisting of multiple materials and 3 D <b>volumes.</b> <b>Index</b> TermsÐPhysically-based vision, deformable models, nonrigid motion analysis, biomedical applications, finite element analysis...|$|E

MethodsBilateral near infrared spectroscopy and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography sensors were placed, and values were recorded immediately before, during, and after regional low-flow cerebral perfusion at 18 °C. Cerebral oxygen saturations, cerebral blood flow velocities, and cerebral blood <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> values were compared by Mann-Whitney U test. Correlations between values of cerebral blood <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> and cerebral blood flow velocity were tested with Spearman rank order correlation. ResultsTwenty patients were studied. Median cerebral oxygen saturations for the right and left sides were 95 % and 95 % before regional low-flow cerebral perfusion, 95 % and 87 % during regional low-flow cerebral perfusion (P =. 054), and 93 % and 94 % after regional low-flow cerebral perfusion. Median cerebral blood flow velocity values did not change during regional low-flow cerebral perfusion. Cerebral blood <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> exhibited a poor correlation with cerebral blood flow velocity.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether high intensity, long-term aerobic training causes the left ventricle to develop different mechanisms for increasing cardiac output during submaximal and maximal upright bicycle exercise. Fifteen competitive collegiate long distance runners and 14 healthy sedentary adults were studied with use of subcostal view four chamber two-dimensional echocardiography at rest and during and at peak maximal upright bicycle exercise. At rest, the athletes had a larger end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (85 ± 14 ml/m 2) (mean ± 1 SD) than that of the sedentary adults (62 ± 14 ml/m 2) and a larger end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (37 ± 11 versus 21 ± 6 ml/m 2). During low and moderate intensity exercise, end-diastolic and stroke <b>volume</b> <b>indexes</b> increased in both groups, but at high intensity exercise and at peak exercise the end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> of both groups decreased significantly below rest value (athletes, 61 ± 14; sedentary subjects, 46 ± 10 ml/m 2, both p < 0. 001 compared with rest). Reflecting the decreased end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> at peak exercise, the stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> had decreased from intermediate exercise values in both groups and was not different from rest values. Therefore, although long distance runners have a dilated left ventricle at rest, they utilize the same mechanisms as sedentary adults for increasing cardiac output during upright dynamic exercise. At low and moderate level exercise, the Frank-Starling mechanism is a dominant mechanism for increasing cardiac output, but at peak exercise, probably because of reduced diastolic left ventricular filling, enhanced contractility is the major mechanism for maintaining stroke volume...|$|R

In the present second pilot study, we enrolled 30 patients with clinically stable ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction randomized to anakinra, recombinant interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist, 100 mg/day for 14 days or placebo in a double-blind fashion. The primary end point was {{the difference in the}} interval change in left ventricular (LV) end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> between the 2 groups within 10 to 14 weeks. The secondary end points included changes in the LV end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> LV ejection fraction, and C-reactive protein levels. No significant changes in end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> LV end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> or LV ejection fraction were seen in the placebo group. Compared to placebo, treatment with anakinra led to no measurable differences in these parameters. Anakinra significantly blunted the increase in C-reactive protein between admission and 72 hours (+ 0. 8 mg/dl, interquartile range - 6. 4 to + 4. 2, vs + 21. 1 mg/dl, interquartile range + 8. 7 to + 36. 6, p = 0. 002), which correlated with the changes in LV end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> and LV end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> at 10 to 14 weeks (R = + 0. 83, p = 0. 002, and R = + 0. 55, p = 0. 077, respectively). One patient in the placebo group (7 %) died. One patient (7 %) in the anakinra group developed recurrent acute myocardial infarction. More patients were diagnosed with new-onset heart failure in the placebo group (4, 27 %) than in the anakinra group (1, 7 %; p = 0. 13). When the data were pooled with those from the first Virginia Commonwealth University-Anakinra Remodeling Trial (n = 40), this difference reached statistical significance (30 % vs 5 %, p = 0. 035). In conclusion, interleukin- 1 blockade with anakinra blunted the acute inflammatory response associated with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction. Although it failed to show a statistically significant effect on LV end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> LV end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> or LV ejection fraction in this cohort of clinically stable patients with near-normal LV dimensions and function, anakinra led to a numerically lower incidence of heart failure. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

MethodsA total of 119 patients with severe aortic valve stenosis scheduled for aortic valve replacement were evaluated preoperatively and divided into 2 groups according to left atrial <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (≥ 40 mL/m 2). Echocardiography was repeated 12 months after surgery. Patients were followed up for 24 months. The primary end point was the composite end point overall mortality and hospitalization due to congestive heart failure. ResultsPreoperative left atrial dilation was associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and increased filling pressure. Preoperative left atrial <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> was associated with persistent abnormalities in left ventricular filling pressure and left ventricular mass index at 1 year after surgery. Event-free survival in patients with left atrial <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> of 40 mL/m 2 or more at 1 year was 71 % compared with 88 % in patients with left atrial <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> less than 40 mL/m 2 (P =. 002). Patients with preoperative increased E/e’ ratio and left ventricular hypertrophy were at increased risk.

SBSE showed wall motion abnormalities in each patient, whereas treadmill did not detect wail motion abnormalities in 4 patients (3 single-vessel; 1 multivessel); of the other 6 patients, 2 showed a lower wall motion score index and 4 did not show any difference in left ventricle kinetics with the 2 methodologies of exercise. Mean acquisition time for postexercise images was 72 +/- 6 seconds. Group B: SBSE resulted in lower work load, heart rate, heart rate x systolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure/end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> and higher end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> and end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index.</b> Systolic blood pressure was similar with SBSE and treadmill testing.

In the control subjects, pacing caused a decrease in end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (77 +/- 19 [mean +/- SD] ml/M 2 at rest, 50 +/- 18 ml/M 2 at peak pacing; p less than 0. 001), a decrease in end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (34 +/- 14 ml/M 2 at rest, 19 +/- 9 ml/M 2 at peak pacing; p less than 0. 001), an increase in ejection fraction (0. 61 +/- 0. 11 at rest, 0. 66 +/- 0. 11 at peak pacing; p = 0. 006); and no deterioration in wall motion. In 16 patients with coronary artery disease who developed ECG and/or metabolic evidence of ischemia during pacing, end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> decreased (87 +/- 26 ml/M 2 at rest, 69 +/- 24 ml/M 2 at peak pacing; p less than 0. 001), end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> was unchanged (43 +/- 20 ml/M 2 at rest, 44 +/- 21 ml/M 2 at peak pacing; p = NS), ejection fraction decreased (0. 55 +/- 0. 12 at rest, 0. 40 +/- 0. 14 at peak pacing; p less than 0. 001), and new wall motion abnormalities developed in 14. In 11 patients with coronary artery disease but no ECG or metabolic evidence of ischemia, pacing caused a decrease in end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (80 +/- 26 ml/M 2 to 61 +/- 31 ml/M 2; p less than 0. 001), a decrease in end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (36 +/- 17 ml/M 2 to 28 +/- 20 ml/M 2; p = 0. 002), no change in ejection fraction (0. 60 +/- 0. 11 to 0. 60 +/- 0. 13; p = NS), and new wall motion abnormalities in four. Although the specificity of these scintigraphic measurements for the identification of patients with coronary artery disease was excellent (1. 0), the combined sensitivity of all scintigraphic measurements was high only if ECG or metabolic evidence of ischemia was present: 0. 94 in patients with evidence of ischemia but only 0. 36 in those without ischemia. Thus radionuclide ventriculography during incremental atrial pacing is useful in the identification of patients with coronary artery disease only if ischemia is induced...|$|R
40|$|Sludge <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (SVI) can {{evaluate}} and reflect the aggregation of activated sludge sediment properties accurately. It {{is an important}} parameter to predict sludge bulking. Generally, if SVI value is too high, the description is sludge settling performance is poor. It will occur or has occurred sludge bulking. But SVI cannot be online measurement, offline assay data obtained {{for a long time}} or other issues. To solve this problem, this paper has applied soft-sensing technology for the sludge <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> that reflects sludge bulking, using rough set to reduce the instrumental variables then construct the soft-sensing model with RBF neural network to complete the dataset of sludge <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> and then, employed the grey Markov model to predict the dataset to collect the important information of sludge bulking in the quantitative respect, in order to achieve real-time prediction of sludge bulking...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to assess the accuracy of qualitative angiographic grading in persons with aortic regurgitation (AR) or mitral regurgitation (MR) and to determine the factors that may influence the reliability of such grading. In 230 patients (152 men, 78 women, aged 52 +/- 14 years) with AR or MR, forward cardiac index {{was measured by the}} Fick and indicator dilution techniques and left ventricular (LV) angiographic index by the area-length method, from which the regurgitant <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> was calculated. In 124 other patients (89 men, 35 women, aged 52 +/- 11 years) without regurgitation, there was good agreement between forward and angiographic cardiac indexes (r = 0. 87, p less than 0. 001). In the 83 patients with AR, the regurgitant <b>volume</b> <b>indexes</b> in those with 1 + (0. 87 +/- 0. 57 liters/min/m 2) and 2 + (1. 72 +/- 1. 19 liters/min/m 2) angiographic regurgitation were not significantly different from one another, but were significantly different from those with 3 + (3. 0 +/- 1. 42 liters/min/m 2) and 4 + (4. 80 +/- 2. 25 liters/min/m 2) regurgitation; at the same time, the regurgitant <b>volume</b> <b>indexes</b> of patients with 3 + and 4 + AR were not significantly different from one another. In the 147 patients with MR, the regurgitant <b>volume</b> <b>indexes</b> in patients with 1 + regurgitation (0. 61 +/- 0. 64 liters/min/m 2) were significantly lower than other grades, but the regurgitant <b>volume</b> <b>indexes</b> of 2 + (1. 14 +/- 0. 85 liters/min/m 2) vs 3 + (2. 14 +/- 1. 37 liters/min/m 2) and of 3 + vs 4 + (4. 60 +/- 2. 31 liters/min/m 2) were not significantly different. With AR and MR, regurgitant flow within each angiographic grade varied widely, especially in grades 3 + and 4 +, and there was considerable overlap of regurgitant <b>volume</b> <b>indexes</b> between grades.
