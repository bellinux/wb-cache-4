40|$|The {{behavior}} of masonry shear walls is fundamental {{in the design}} of masonry buildings subjected to different actions, namely of seismic nature. The usage of unreinforced, confined or reinforced masonry is currently subjected to a strong debate in Europe due to the new codes. In particular, the part of Eurocode 8 (Design of structures for earthquake resistance) related to masonry structures is only a limited compromise for the different countries. A large testing program was started at University of Minho in order to clarify issues regarding confined masonry and unfilled <b>vertical</b> <b>joints.</b> Confined masonry is assumed as a hybrid material joining masonry with small section horizontal and vertical lightly reinforced concrete elements. This project, partly sponsored by the light-weight concrete block industry, aims at defining adequate structural solutions for regions of low to high seismicity in Portugal. This paper discusses the results of the experimental program, consisting mainly of masonry walls subjected to cyclic actions and constant pre-compression. Sixteen specimens are considered, being the shear strength, ductility, energy dissipation and stiffness discussed. The key aspects under discussion are: (a) the possibility of replacing the filling of the <b>vertical</b> <b>joints</b> by interlocking and horizontal bed joint reinforcement, (b) the need for filling <b>vertical</b> <b>joints</b> in confined masonry solutions...|$|R

25|$|A {{concrete}}-face rock-fill dam (CFRD) is a rock-fill dam {{with concrete}} slabs on its upstream face. This design provides the concrete slab as an impervious wall to prevent leakage {{and also a}} structure without concern for uplift pressure. In addition, the CFRD design is flexible for topography, faster to construct and less costly than earth-fill dams. The CFRD concept originated during the California Gold Rush in the 1860s when miners constructed rock-fill timber-face dams for sluice operations. The timber was later replaced by concrete as the design was applied to irrigation and power schemes. As CFRD designs grew in height during the 1960s, the fill was compacted and the slab's horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>joints</b> were replaced with improved <b>vertical</b> <b>joints.</b> In the last few decades, the design has become popular.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of rock exposed at Alabama Hills. One is an orange, drab {{weathered}} metamorphosed volcanic rock that is 150-200 million years old. The other type of rock exposed here is 82- to 85-million-year-old biotite monzogranite which weathers to potato-shaped large boulders, many of which stand on end due to spheroidal weathering acting on many nearly <b>vertical</b> <b>joints</b> in the rock.|$|R

50|$|Numerous <b>vertical</b> <b>joint</b> planes {{controlled}} {{where and}} how fast erosion took place. Most of these long, linear and very deep cracks trend northeast or northwest and form parallel, often regularly spaced sets. They were created by uplift-associated pressure release and by the unloading of overlying rock via erosion. The great majority of Yosemite Valley's widening, for example, was due to joint-controlled rockfall. In fact, only 10% of its widening and 12% of its excavation {{are thought to be}} the result of glaciation. Large, relatively unjointed volumes of granite form domes such as Half Dome and monoliths like the 3604 feet (1098 m) high El Capitan. Closely spaced joints lead to the creation of columns, pillers, and pinnacles such as Washington Column, Cathedral Spires, and Split Pinnacle.|$|E
50|$|The castle {{is built}} {{on the top of}} a narrow hill near Haldenstein with steep cliffs on two sides. North-east of the castle was a ditch that {{protected}} the outer wall. The outer wall encloses a rough square courtyard. The original gate in the outer wall was sealed up at some point and the location of the new gate is unknown. A three story living quarters building was built on the highest point of the hilltop. It is an elongated rectangle with a door on the south-east side. As that door opens out onto a cliff, a wooden platform probably connected the door to the courtyard. A <b>vertical</b> <b>joint</b> in the walls of the residence indicates that it was expanded at least once. A large cistern in the living quarters held water for the castle.|$|E
50|$|Internal {{doors at}} either end of the bar access the rear section of the building. On the {{southern}} side of the building the door from the front bar accesses a small hallway with an entrance door to Victoria Street. The hall leads on to two parlour rooms with pressed metal ceilings and brick fireplaces to the west, and the main central staircase to the east. A newer spacious lounge area is located in a central position in the rear section of the building which has the afore mentioned lantern style roof. The upper floor is accessed by the central staircase with original timber balustrading. The ceiling over the staircase retains its decorative pressed metal. The stairs land onto a long north-south hallway which is clad with sheeting material and accesses a large doorway to the southern verandah. Three large bedrooms with original fireplaces line this hallway, all have doors to the verandahs. There are two narrow hallways running east-west on either end of the building each lined with bedrooms on either side. The southerly hallway still displays original <b>Vertical</b> <b>Joint</b> timber work and a decorative arch at its entrance. These hallways are connected by an intersecting hall along the former enclosed verandah at the rear of the building.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{long-term}} stress relief in a cliff behind a {{hydroelectric power station}} at Niagara Falls are examined both factually and analytically. A consideration {{of the history of}} crestline recession of the Horseshoe Falls indicates that the age of this cliff is probably in the order of 400 years. Over this period of time, gradual release of strain energy from the rock mass resulted in a progressive movement of the cliff towards the Niagara Gorge, accompanied by the development of <b>vertical</b> <b>jointing</b> behind the face of the cliff. This and other findings of the analytical study are apparently in agreement with the general observations made along the Niagara Gorge, {{as well as with the}} results of in-situ stress measurements obtained in the area. It is further suggested that the combination of <b>vertical</b> <b>jointing</b> and horizontal bedding contributes to the disintegration of the rock mass in and above the Rochester Shale Formation, enhancing the occurrence of rockfalls and the erosion of the Niagara Gorge itself. © 1978. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
