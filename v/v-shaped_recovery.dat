40|$|Abstract: There {{are many}} studies on {{financial}} {{crisis in the}} literature but few have suggested a clear economic theory to explain why crises may happen and why economic recovery may take different shapes. This paper presents a new economic theory to explain {{the formation of a}} crisis and why a major crisis may {{take a long time to}} recover. It suggests that asymmetric psychological reaction of market players to gains and losses is the principal cause of a crisis and responsible for a prolonging recovery. Three different shapes of recovery, V, U and L, are defined and explained. During the current financial crisis, some countries such as China and India may have a <b>V-shaped</b> <b>recovery,</b> some countries such as the UK and the US may have a U-shaped recovery. An important policy implication is that effective macro-economic policies should be designed to smooth market movements and implementation of such policies has to be counter-cyclical rather than pro-cyclical...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{recoveries}} {{from the}} past two recessions {{have been much more}} gradual than the rapid <b>V-shaped</b> <b>recoveries</b> typical of earlier downturns. Analysis of the factors that determine economic growth rates indicates that recovery from the most recent recession is likely to be faster than from the two previous recessions, but slower than earlier <b>V-shaped</b> <b>recoveries.</b> By many measures, the most recent recession has been the worst in the United States since the Great Depression. Will the recovery now under way be rapid, as it was following most postwar recessions through the mid- 1980 s? Or will growth be more modest, as it was following the two most recent recessions? This question is often rephrased in terms of the shape of the recovery. That is, will economic activity turn up sharply, tracing out the upward sweep of the letter V? Or will it be more gradual, like {{the lower part of the}} letter U? This Economic Letter examines the key factors that determined the shape of past recoveries and assesses how they are influencing the pace of recovery this time. Shaping recoveries Basic macroeconomic theory identifies three major factors that affect growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) : the degree of slack in the economy, the stance of monetary policy, and the trend growth rate of potential GDP. Using the model of the U. S. economy presented in Laubach and Williams (2003) ...|$|R

S. recessions might look more like the Eurosclerosis experience of the 1980 s than traditional <b>V-shaped</b> <b>recoveries</b> of the past. In this paper, we revisit possible explanations for this rising persistence. First, we argue that financial shocks do not systematically lead to more persistent unemployment than monetary policy shocks, so these cannot explain the rising {{persistence of}} unemployment. Second, monetary and fiscal policies can account for only part of the evolving unemployment persistence. Therefore, we turn to a third class of explanations: propagation mechanisms. We focus on factors consistent with four other cyclical patterns which have evolved since the early 1980 s: a rising cyclicality in long-term unemployment, lower regional convergence after downturns, rising cyclicality in disability claims, and missing disinflation. These factors include declining labor mobility, changing age structures, and the decline in trust among Americans. To determine how these factors affect unemployment persistence, this paper exploits regional variation in labor market outcomes across Western Europe and North America during 1970 - 1990, in contrast to most previous work focusing either on cross-country variation or regional variation within countries. The results suggest that only cultural factors can account for the rising persistence of unemployment in the U.

40|$|ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY? INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL FLOWS AND DOMESTIC FINANCIAL REFORMS IN EAST ASIA Ramkishen S. Rajan This paper {{discusses}} {{trends and}} patterns in international capital flows {{in the crisis}} affected East Asian economies during the bust period and eventual recovery that followed (1997 to early 2000). The economies have experienced a rapid rebound in regional economic activity, i. e. the recessions, though severe, {{have proven to be}} short-lived. While this is generally taken {{as a sign of the}} regions oft-repeated economic strengths (such as their high saving rates), in actuality, such a post-crisis <b>V-shaped</b> <b>recovery</b> is not unique to East Asia, typifying financial crises experiences in general. Rather, of concern is that the rapid recovery in capital flows and economic activity in regional economies may retard their commitment to push ahead with necessary structural reforms so essential to ensure that growth is sustained. The paper therefore offers an overview of the financial sector restructuring efforts undertaken by the crisis hit economies to date.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} currency crisis and recovery in three East Asian countries, Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea. Using macro economic data for the three countries over a 13 year period, 1990 – 2002, the paper examines the factors leading to the crisis, the policy response to the crisis, an evaluation of their recovery and the lessons that can be learnt. During the seven year period prior to the crisis, all three countries experienced very rapid GDP growth. Collectively, average annual GDP growth was 11. 5 %. This growth however was fueled by rapid monetary growth, current account deficits, negative S-I gaps and short term capital inflows. As a result, serious structural weaknesses were built. Overvalued exchange rates enhanced the vulnerabilities. The two year period of crisis, saw sharply negative GDP growth in all three countries. These were accentuated by the contractionary policies. While Thailand and South Korea had {{to turn to the}} IMF and adopt the IMF package, Malaysia took the ‘unorthodox’ route of capital controls and currency peg. The paper argues that despite different policy stance the underlying responses were the same. All three countries experienced a <b>V-shaped</b> <b>recovery.</b> Malaysia’s controversial policies appears to have provided no additional advantage. The paper concludes with an outline of key lessons for policy makers from the experience of the three countries. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{persistence}} of U. S. unemployment has risen {{with each of}} the last three recessions, raising the specter that future U. S. recessions might look more like the “Eurosclerosis ” experience of the 1980 s than like the tra-ditional <b>V-shaped</b> <b>recoveries</b> of the past. We revisit several explanations for this rising persistence, decomposing them into three possible sources: business cycle fluctuations, changing policy responses, and propagation mechanisms. First, we find that financial shocks do not systematically lead to more persistent unemployment than monetary policy shocks, casting doubt on the hypothesis that different drivers of business cycles are the primary explanation. Second, we find that changing monetary and fiscal policy responses account for approx-imately one-third of the rise in unemployment persistence. Third, after examin-ing three propagation mechanisms we find that jointly they cannot account for any rising {{persistence of}} unemployment. The three propagation mecha-nisms we focus on—declining labor mobility, changing age structures, and the decline in trust among Americans—are consistent with four other cyclical pat-terns that have evolved since the early 1980 s: a rising cyclicality in long-term unemployment, lower regional convergence after downturns, rising cyclicality in disability claims, and missing disinflation. We exploit regional variation in labor market outcomes across Western Europe and North America during 1970 – 91 to assess the predictive capacity of each propagation mechanism for unemployment persistence. In summary, two-thirds of the rise in unemployment persistence is unexplained...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographyExecutive Summary World {{economic}} growth gained momentum in 1999 increasing by 3. 3 per cent, impelled by vibrant {{activity in the}} United States and Asia. The robust United States expansion continued with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growing by 4. 2 per cent. The European Area with growth of 2. 3 per cent experienced similar dynamism. In both of these economies strong GDP growth was matched by firm gains in employment. Growth was also more robust in developing countries, as a whole, but showed important disparity by region. Buoyed by competitive exchange rates and strong demand in the United States and the European Area, growth rebounded strongly in the Asia-Pacific region. This contrasted with declining growth performance in Africa, the Middle East and Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean. Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa continued to be imperiled by declining commodity prices, poor investor confidence and disruptions occasioned by war and adverse weather. Meanwhile, growth slipped in Latin America and the Caribbean, as the impetus in Mexico, Central America and a few Caribbean countries was dampened by sluggish output growth and export performance in the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) subregion. Growth rates of 0. 5 per cent in Brazil and a decline of 3. 5 per cent in Argentina, contrasted with 3. 5 per cent growth in Mexico. Caribbean countries' growth performance was strongly influenced by the export multiplier. Growth in the Dominican Republic (8. 2 per cent), Belize (6. 2 per cent) and Trinidad and Tobago (4. 2 per cent) was stimulated by their ability {{to take advantage of}} the booming United States market, while Jamaica (- 0. 4 per cent), the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and Suriname, whose exports were relatively uncompetitive, recorded weaker growth. OECS banana exports were hard hit, contracting by almost 8 per cent in 1999. Inflation was also subdued in most regions, except the Countries in Transition, where bottlenecks led to a doubling of the rate. World trade rebounded in 1999, and was indeed the main engine of growth. The impetus for the improvement in trade was largely provided by the Asian economies that staged <b>v-shaped</b> <b>recoveries.</b> Merchandise trade also picked up in Latin America and the Caribbean, bolstered by the competitive strength of Mexico and Central America. By contrast, merchandise exports declined in Africa and the Transition economies by 15. 5 per cent and 1. 5 per cent, respectively, precipitated by weakened commodity demand and prices. In the services sector, tourism gained momentum, growing by 4. 1 per cent, up from 3. 1 per cent in 1998. The United States continued to garner the lion's share of tourism receipts. This suggests that developing countries, such as those in the Caribbean, need to diversify and revitalize their tourism product and service to improve their market share in the sector. There was a flurry of activity on the institutional and trade negotiation fronts in 1999, aimed mainly at promoting regionalism and financial regulation. The World Trade Organization (WTO) held its Third Ministerial Meeting in Seattle, Washington, to advance the millennium round of trade negotiations, with the main focus on the liberalisation of agriculture and services, the unfinished agenda from the Uruguay Round and also new issues. However, the meeting was largely unsuccessful due to disagreements among developing and developed countries over the vital issues for focus and disruptive protests by labour and environmental lobby groups. A crowning achievement of European integration, the euro, was launched as the future currency of the integration bloc. Notably, the groundwork for the African Caribbean Pacific-European Union (ACP-EU) Partnership Agreement, the successor to the Lomé ‰V Agreement, was laid in 1999, and the agreement was signed in June of 2000. The agreement provides for a strengthened partnership based on poverty reduction and structured integration of the ACP countries into the world economy. In addition, the preferential access to the United States market was extended to the Caribbean through the Caribbean Basin Trade Pact (CBTPA) that was passed by the United States Congress in May 2000. This should provide important market access for competitive textile, apparel, fish and other products from the Caribbean. Financial reforms centred on strengthening financial institutions and regulatory arrangements to limit the prospect of future crises. The Financial Stability Forum was mandated to undertake work in this area. Financial conditions also improved, buttressed by strengthened investor confidence and equity prices. However, net private capital flows seem still to be affected by some investor uncertainty and, probably, better discrimination between countries with high and low risk profiles. World saving was stable at roughly 23. 2 per cent of GDP in 1999. Saving in advanced economies declined slightly to 22. 1 per cent of GDP influenced by robust spending in the United States, the EU and, to a lesser extent, Japan. Developing countries' savings also fell marginally to 25. 4 per cent of GDP, as the increase in the rate in the Middle East and Africa was offset by the decline in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. Developed countries' investment was up slightly, while in developing countries, investment declined marginally. Reflecting in part saving, investment and exports, the current account deficit of developing countries narrowed substantially by 63 per cent. Capital flows to developing countries slipped by almost 9. 0 per cent in 1999. Net resource flows to Latin America and the Caribbean contracted by about 30 per cent, and could not be compensated for by higher flows to Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. The welcome increase in flows to Sub-Saharan Africa, however, was unevenly distributed, with the lion's share going to South Africa, attracted by its privatisation programmes and other reforms. Growth in the external debt of developing countries slowed to 1. 6 per cent in 1999. The carry over from declining oil prices in 1998, led to the fastest growth in debt in the Middle East and Europe (3. 9 per cent). Africa's debt grew by 2. 3 per cent, largely on account of higher debt accumulation in North Africa to counter the effects of sluggish oil prices early in the year. External debt in Latin America and the Caribbean was up, by only 0. 5 per cent. Private debt declined in line with lower payments commitments as a result of sluggish MERCOSUR trade. The debt relief initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) was extended in 1999. Countries such as Bolivia, Guyana, Mali and Mozambique benefited under the programme of debt write-offs. Debt reduction in Guyana, for instance, has enabled higher social spending...|$|R
