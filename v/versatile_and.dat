5|$|The {{paradigm}} gave researchers {{license to}} study isolated problems and find solutions that were both verifiable and useful. It provided {{a common language}} to describe problems and share their solutions with each other, and with other fields that also used concepts of abstract agents, like economics and control theory.

5|$|Many welding {{processes}} {{require the use}} of a particular joint design; for example, resistance spot welding, laser beam welding, and electron beam welding are most frequently performed on lap joints. Other welding methods, like shielded metal arc welding, are extremely <b>versatile</b> <b>and</b> can weld virtually any type of joint. Some processes {{can also be used to}} make multipass welds, in which one weld is allowed to cool, and then another weld is performed on top of it. This allows for the welding of thick sections arranged in a single-V preparation joint, for example.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Portia have hunting tactics as <b>versatile</b> <b>and</b> {{adaptable}} as a lion's. All members of Portia have instinctive tactics for their most common prey, but can improvise {{by trial and error}} against unfamiliar prey or in unfamiliar situations, and then remember the new approach. They can also make detours to find the best attack angle against dangerous prey, even when the best detour takes a Portia out of visual contact with the prey, and sometimes the planned route leads to abseiling down a silk thread and biting the prey from behind. Such detours may take up to an hour, and a Portia usually picks the best route even if it needs to walk past an incorrect route. If a Portia makes a mistake while hunting another spider, it may itself be killed.|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the best}} players in the world in his {{position}} during his prime, Evra is a fast, energetic and athletic left back, who, despite his size, is physically strong, and good in the air, which also allows him to be deployed as a centre-back on occasion; in addition to his physical attributes, he is also comfortable on the ball and adept at getting into attacking positions as a wing-back, where he can deliver crosses to teammates, having functioned as a winger earlier on in his career. An aggressive, tactically intelligent, <b>versatile</b> <b>and</b> hard-working player, he is also renowned for his leadership and tenacity on the pitch. These attributes make him effective both offensively and defensively.|$|E
5|$|The {{process is}} <b>versatile</b> <b>and</b> can be {{performed}} with relatively inexpensive equipment, making it well suited to shop jobs and field work. An operator can become reasonably proficient with a modest amount of training and can achieve mastery with experience. Weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding. Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though special electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron, nickel, aluminum, copper, and other metals.|$|E

5|$|The psionic and technologically adept Protoss {{have access}} to {{powerful}} units and machinery and advanced technologies such as energy shields and localized warp capabilities, powered by their psionic traits. However, their forces have lengthy and expensive manufacturing processes, encouraging players to follow a strategy {{of the quality of}} their units over the quantity. The insectoid Zerg possess entirely organic units and structures, which can be produced quickly and at a far cheaper cost to resources, but are accordingly weaker, relying on sheer numbers and speed to overwhelm enemies. The humanoid Terrans provide a middle ground between the other two races, providing units that are <b>versatile</b> <b>and</b> flexible.

5|$|The {{resistive}} Joule {{heating effect}} employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is <b>versatile</b> <b>and</b> controllable, {{it can be}} seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.|$|E

5|$|A {{prolific}} goalscorer, Villa {{is regarded}} by pundits {{as one of}} the best forwards of his generation, and one of the best Spanish strikers of all-time. An opportunistic, <b>versatile</b> <b>and</b> well-rounded player, Villa is naturally right-footed, but an accurate and powerful finisher with either foot, due to his ambidexterity, both inside and outside the area, despite his lack of height or physicality; he is also a set piece and penalty kick specialist. Villa is a quick, agile, and mobile team player, with excellent technique and dribbling skills, who is also known for his work-rate and intelligent offensive movement, as well as his ability to either create space for teammates or make attacking runs into the area. Due to his vision and passing ability, he is also capable of dropping deep to link up play with midfielders, and of creating chances and providing assists for teammates, which has allowed him to be deployed as a supporting forward, as an attacking midfielder or as a winger throughout his career, in addition to his more common role as a centre-forward.|$|E
5|$|In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus {{experimented with}} amber rods and these {{experiments}} {{were the first}} studies into the production of electrical energy. While this method, {{now known as the}} triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electrical energy. The battery is a <b>versatile</b> <b>and</b> very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications, but its energy storage is finite, and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged. For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines.|$|E
5|$|Onions are {{commonly}} chopped {{and used as}} an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes, and may {{also be used as}} a main ingredient in their own right, for example in French onion soup or onion chutney. They are <b>versatile</b> <b>and</b> can be baked, boiled, braised, grilled, fried, roasted, sautéed, or eaten raw in salads. Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked, facilitating stuffing them, as in sogan-dolma. Onions are a staple in Indian cuisine, used as a thickening agent for curries and gravies. Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack. These are traditionally a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. Pickled onions form part of a British pub ploughman's lunch, usually served with cheese and ale. In North America, sliced onions are battered, deep-fried, and served as onion rings.|$|E
