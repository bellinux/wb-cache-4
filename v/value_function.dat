Mathematically, this corresponds to the absolute <b>value</b> <b>function.</b> Full-wave rectification converts both polarities of the input waveform to pulsating DC (direct current), and yields a higher average output voltage. Two diodes and a center tapped transformer, or four diodes in a bridge configuration and any AC source (including a transformer without center tap), are needed. Single semiconductor diodes, double diodes with common cathode or common anode, and four-diode bridges, are manufactured as single components.|$|E
25|$|Real {{and complex}} embeddings {{can be put}} on the same footing as prime ideals by {{adopting}} a perspective based on valuations. Consider, for example, the integers. In addition to the usual absolute <b>value</b> <b>function</b> |·| : Q → R, there are p-adic absolute value functions |·|p : Q → R, defined for each prime number p, which measure divisibility by p. Ostrowski's theorem states that these are all possible absolute value functions on Q (up to equivalence). Therefore, absolute values are a common language to describe both the real embedding of Q and the prime numbers.|$|E

2500|$|A {{place of}} an {{algebraic}} number field is an equivalence class of absolute value functions on K. There {{are two types}} of places. There is a -adic absolute value for each prime ideal [...] of O, and, like the p-adic absolute values, it measures divisibility. These are called finite places. [...] The other type of place is specified using a real or complex embedding of K and the standard absolute <b>value</b> <b>function</b> on R or C. These are infinite places. Because absolute values are unable to distinguish between a complex embedding and its conjugate, a complex embedding and its conjugate determine the same place. Therefore, there are [...] real places and [...] complex places. Because places encompass the primes, places are sometimes referred to as primes. [...] When this is done, finite places are called finite primes and infinite places are called infinite primes. If [...] is a valuation corresponding to an absolute value, then one frequently writes [...] to mean that [...] is an infinite place and [...] to mean that it is a finite place.|$|E
2500|$|CCS (count, compare, and skip): A complex {{conditional}} branch instruction. The A register {{was loaded with}} data retrieved from the address specified by the instruction. (Because the AGC uses ones' complement notation, there are two representations of zero. When all bits are set to zero, this is called plus zero. If all bits are set to one, this is called minus zero.) The diminished absolute value (DABS) of the data was then computed and stored in the A register. If the number was greater than zero, the DABS decrements the value by 1; if the number was negative, it is complemented before the decrement is applied—this is the absolute value. Diminished means [...] "decremented but not below zero". Therefore, when the AGC performs the DABS function, positive numbers will head toward plus zero, and so will negative numbers but first revealing their negativity via the four-way skip below. The final step in CCS is a four-way skip, depending upon the data in register A before the DABS. If register A was greater than 0, CCS skips to the first instruction immediately after CCS. If register A contained plus zero, CCS skips to the second instruction after CCS. Less than zero causes a skip to the third instruction after CCS, and minus zero skips to the fourth instruction after CCS. The {{primary purpose of the}} count was to allow an ordinary loop, controlled by a positive counter, to end in a CCS and a TC {{to the beginning of the}} loop, equivalent to an IBM 360's BCT. The absolute <b>value</b> <b>function</b> was deemed important enough to be built into this instruction; when used for only this purpose, the sequence after the CCS was TC *+2, TC *+2, AD ONE. A curious side effect was the creation and use of CCS-holes when the value being tested was known to be never positive, which occurred more often than one might suppose. That left two whole words unoccupied, and a special committee was responsible for assigning data constants to these holes.|$|E
